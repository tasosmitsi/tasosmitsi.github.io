00:00.000 --> 00:01.760
I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

00:01.760 --> 00:03.080
I would like to know.

00:03.080 --> 00:05.600
Two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet,

00:05.600 --> 00:07.120
what's that look like exactly?

00:07.120 --> 00:09.760
When you see them and they see you,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.480
you're assuming they have vision,

00:11.480 --> 00:13.560
they have the ability to construct in 3D,

00:13.560 --> 00:16.400
and in time, there's a lot of assumptions we're making.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.680
What human level intelligence has done is quite different.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.640
It's not just that we remember states

00:21.640 --> 00:23.920
that the universe has existed in before,

00:23.920 --> 00:26.640
it's that we can imagine ones that have never existed,

00:26.640 --> 00:29.240
and we can actually make them come into existence.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.600
So you can travel back in time sometimes.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.440
Yes.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.080
You travel forward in time to travel back.

00:35.080 --> 00:35.920
Yes.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.360
The following is a conversation

00:40.360 --> 00:42.760
with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

00:42.760 --> 00:46.320
They have each been on this podcast once before individually,

00:46.320 --> 00:49.920
and now for their second time, they're here together.

00:49.920 --> 00:54.000
Sarah is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.800
Lee is a chemist, and if I may say so,

00:57.800 --> 01:01.600
the real-life manifestation of Rick from Rick and Morty.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.400
They both are interested in how life originates

01:04.400 --> 01:08.560
and develops both life here on Earth and alien life,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.280
including intelligent alien civilizations

01:11.280 --> 01:13.280
out there in the cosmos.

01:13.280 --> 01:15.560
They are colleagues and friends

01:15.560 --> 01:18.040
who love to explore, disagree, and debate

01:18.040 --> 01:20.240
nuanced points about alien life,

01:20.240 --> 01:24.600
and so we're calling this an alien debate.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.320
Very few questions to me are as fascinating

01:27.400 --> 01:29.040
as what do aliens look like?

01:29.040 --> 01:30.680
How do we recognize them?

01:30.680 --> 01:32.200
How do we talk to them?

01:32.200 --> 01:34.960
And how do we make sense of life here on Earth

01:34.960 --> 01:37.160
in the context of all possible life forms

01:37.160 --> 01:38.680
that are out there?

01:38.680 --> 01:41.360
Treating these questions with the seriousness

01:41.360 --> 01:44.280
and rigor they deserve is what I hope to do

01:44.280 --> 01:48.240
with this conversation and future ones like it.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.440
Our world is shrouded in mystery.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.760
We must first be humble to acknowledge this,

01:52.760 --> 01:54.880
and then be bold in diving in

01:54.920 --> 01:57.360
and trying to figure things out anyway.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.480
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

02:01.560 --> 02:02.960

02:02.960 --> 02:07.720
And now, dear friends, here's Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.240
First of all, welcome back, Sarah.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.080
Welcome back, Lee.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.680
You guys, I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
You're incredible people.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.880
I should say thank you to Sarah

02:14.880 --> 02:17.320
for wearing really awesome boots.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.640
We'll probably overlay a picture later on,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.720
but why the hell didn't you dress up, Lee?

02:21.720 --> 02:22.560
No, I'm just kidding.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.400
This is me dressed up.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.320
You're saying that you're pink,

02:25.320 --> 02:28.440
that your thing is pink, my thing is black and white,

02:28.440 --> 02:30.240
the simplicity of it.

02:30.240 --> 02:31.160
Where's the pink?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.440
When did the pink, when did it hit you

02:33.440 --> 02:34.280
that pink is your color?

02:34.280 --> 02:38.680
I became pink about, I don't know, actually,

02:38.680 --> 02:41.480
maybe 2017?

02:41.480 --> 02:42.840
Did you know me when you first-

02:42.840 --> 02:44.080
I think I met you pre-pink.

02:44.080 --> 02:44.920
Yeah, yeah.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.960
So about 2017, I think, I just decided I was boring

02:48.960 --> 02:50.400
and I needed to make a statement.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.280
And red was too bright, so I went pink, salmon pink.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.640
Well, I think you were always pink.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.880
You just found yourself in 2017.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.960
There's an amazing photo of him

03:00.960 --> 03:02.720
where there's like everybody in their black gown

03:02.720 --> 03:04.080
and he's just wearing the pink pants.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.600
Well, that was at the Waggonen University.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.680
It's totally nuts.

03:06.680 --> 03:09.160
100 year anniversary, they got me to give the plenary

03:09.160 --> 03:11.160
and they didn't find the outfit for me.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.520
So they're all wearing these silly hats and these gowns

03:13.520 --> 03:14.720
and there was me dressed up in pink,

03:14.720 --> 03:16.360
looking like a complete idiot.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.400
We're definitely gonna have to find that picture

03:18.400 --> 03:22.560
and overlay it, big full screen, slow motion.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.680
Let's talk about aliens.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.080
We'll find places we disagree and places we agree.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.320
Life, intelligence, consciousness, universe, all of that.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.520
Let's start with a tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson

03:35.520 --> 03:39.640
stating his skepticism about aliens wanting to visit Earth.

03:39.640 --> 03:44.040
Quote, how egocentric of us to think that space aliens

03:44.040 --> 03:47.560
who have mastered interstellar travel across the galaxy

03:47.560 --> 03:51.640
would give, pardon the French,

03:51.680 --> 03:54.920
would give a shit about humans on Earth.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.000
So let me ask you, would aliens care about visiting Earth,

03:58.000 --> 04:00.520
observing, communicating with humans?

04:00.520 --> 04:05.120
Let's take a perspective of aliens, maybe Sarah first.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.440
Are we interesting in the whole spectrum

04:08.440 --> 04:10.280
of life in the universe?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.800
I'm completely biased, at least as far as I think right now

04:13.800 --> 04:16.400
we're the most interesting thing in the universe.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.400
So I would expect based on the intrinsic curiosity

04:21.520 --> 04:25.000
that we have and how much I think that's deeply related

04:25.000 --> 04:26.640
to the physics of what we are,

04:26.640 --> 04:29.880
that other intelligent aliens would want to seek out

04:29.880 --> 04:32.240
examples of the phenomena they are

04:32.240 --> 04:34.440
to understand themselves better.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.200
And I think that's kind of a natural thing to want to do.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.360
And I don't think there's any kind of judgment

04:39.360 --> 04:42.000
on it being a lesser being or not.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.400
It's like saying you have nothing to learn

04:43.400 --> 04:45.120
by talking to a baby.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.040
You have lots to learn, probably more than you do

04:47.040 --> 04:48.360
talking to somebody that's 90.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.400
So yeah, so I think they absolutely would.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.240
So whatever the phenomena is that is human,

04:55.240 --> 04:57.680
there will be an inkling of the same kind of phenomena

04:57.680 --> 05:00.760
within alien species and they will be seeking that same.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.400
I think there's gotta be some features of us

05:02.400 --> 05:03.560
that are universal.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.480
And I think the ones that are most interesting,

05:06.480 --> 05:08.640
and I hope I live in an interesting universe,

05:08.640 --> 05:13.640
are the ones that are driven by our curiosity

05:13.840 --> 05:18.000
and the fact that our intelligence allows us

05:18.040 --> 05:19.960
to do things that the universe wouldn't be able to do

05:19.960 --> 05:21.520
without things like us existing.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.200
We're gonna define a lot of terms.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.040
One of them is interesting.

05:26.040 --> 05:26.880
Yes.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.600
That's a very interesting term to try to define.

05:29.600 --> 05:30.640
Lee, what do you think?

05:30.640 --> 05:33.480
Are humans interesting for aliens?

05:33.480 --> 05:34.840
Well, let's take it from our perspective.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.720
We wanna go find aliens as a species quite desperately.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.720
So if we put the shoe on the other foot,

05:39.720 --> 05:41.360
of course we're interesting.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.760
But I'm wondering, and assuming that we're at

05:44.760 --> 05:46.120
the right technological capabilities

05:46.120 --> 05:47.880
to go searching for aliens,

05:48.720 --> 05:49.560
then that's interesting.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.120
So what I mean is if there needs to be a massive leap

05:52.120 --> 05:54.440
in technology that we don't have,

05:55.640 --> 05:58.840
how will aliens prioritize coming to Earth and other places?

05:58.840 --> 06:02.520
But I do think that they would come and find us

06:02.520 --> 06:04.960
because they'd wanna find out about our culture,

06:04.960 --> 06:06.560
what things are universal.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.760
What about, I mean, I'm a chemist,

06:07.760 --> 06:10.160
so I would say, well, is the chemistry universal, right?

06:10.160 --> 06:11.920
Are the creatures that we're gonna find

06:11.920 --> 06:13.720
making all this commotion,

06:13.720 --> 06:15.440
are they made of the same stuff?

06:16.160 --> 06:19.360
Um, what does their science look like?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.720
Are they off planet yet?

06:22.720 --> 06:26.040
I guess there's, so I think that Neil deGrasse Tyson

06:26.040 --> 06:27.560
is being slightly pessimistic

06:27.560 --> 06:31.960
and maybe trying to play the tune

06:31.960 --> 06:35.320
that the universe is vast and it's not worth them coming here.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.520
I don't think that,

06:37.520 --> 06:40.440
but I just worry that maybe we don't have the ability

06:40.440 --> 06:42.480
to talk to them, we don't have the universal translator,

06:42.480 --> 06:43.680
we don't have the right physics,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.400
but sure, they should come.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.320
We are interesting.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.640
I wanna know if they exist.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.640
It would make it easier if they just came.

06:49.640 --> 06:54.520
So again, I'm gonna use your tweets

06:54.520 --> 06:56.320
like it's Shakespeare and analyze it.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.520
So Sarah tweeted,

06:58.520 --> 07:01.680
thinking about aliens, thinking about aliens.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.720
So how much do you think aliens

07:04.720 --> 07:07.840
are thinking about other aliens, including humans?

07:07.840 --> 07:12.040
So you said we humans want to visit,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.320
like we're longing to connect with aliens.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.160
Why is that?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.000
Can you introspect that?

07:17.000 --> 07:18.680
Is that an obvious thing that we should be,

07:18.680 --> 07:20.840
like what are we hoping to understand

07:20.840 --> 07:23.440
by meeting aliens exactly?

07:23.440 --> 07:25.120
Asking as an introvert,

07:25.120 --> 07:26.800
it's like I ask myself this all the time.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.360
Why go out on a Friday night to meet people?

07:30.360 --> 07:31.200
What are you hoping to find?

07:31.200 --> 07:32.160
I think the curiosity,

07:32.160 --> 07:33.760
so when I saw Sarah put that tweet,

07:33.760 --> 07:35.360
I think I answered it actually as well,

07:35.360 --> 07:38.960
which was we are thinking about trying to make contact.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.840
So they almost certainly are,

07:42.680 --> 07:43.520
but maybe there's a number of classes.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.800
There are those aliens that have not yet made contact

07:46.800 --> 07:49.000
with other aliens like us.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.800
Those aliens have made contact with just one other alien

07:51.800 --> 07:55.080
and maybe it's an anti-climax and slime, right?

07:55.080 --> 07:56.600
And aliens that have made contact

07:56.600 --> 07:59.800
with not just one set of intelligent species, but several.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.160
That must be amazing actually.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.400
Literally there are some place in the universe,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.080
there must be one alien civilization

08:05.080 --> 08:07.040
to not make contact with not one,

08:07.040 --> 08:09.760
but two other intelligent civilizations.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.200
So they must be thinking about it.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.560
There must be entire degree courses on aliens,

08:16.560 --> 08:21.560
thinking about aliens and universal cultural norms.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.560
Do you think they will survive the meeting?

08:24.560 --> 08:26.640
And by the way, Lee did respond saying,

08:26.640 --> 08:28.640
that's all the universe wants.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.480
So Sarah said, thinking about aliens,

08:30.480 --> 08:32.000
thinking about aliens.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.400
Lee said, that's all the universe wants.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.800
And then Sarah responded, cheeky universe we live in.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.240
So cheeky is a cheeky version of the word interesting,

08:42.240 --> 08:45.320
all of which we'll try to define mathematically.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.240
Cheeky might be harder than interesting.

08:47.240 --> 08:48.680
Because there's humor in that too.

08:48.680 --> 08:49.560
Yes.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.480
I think there's a mathematical definition of humor,

08:51.480 --> 08:52.880
but we'll talk about that in a bit.

08:52.880 --> 08:53.720
Oh, interesting.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.720
Yeah, true there is, yeah.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.760
So if you're a graduate student alien

08:57.760 --> 09:00.800
looking at multiple alien civilizations,

09:00.800 --> 09:03.640
do you think they survive the encounters?

09:03.640 --> 09:06.640
I think there's a tendency to anthropomorphize

09:06.640 --> 09:08.160
a lot of the discussions about alien life,

09:08.160 --> 09:10.160
which is a really big challenge.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.120
So usually when I'm trying to think about these problems,

09:13.120 --> 09:16.520
I don't try to think about us as humans,

09:16.520 --> 09:18.280
but us as an example of phenomena

09:18.280 --> 09:21.360
that exists in the universe that we have yet to explain.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.480
And it doesn't seem to be the case

09:24.480 --> 09:27.640
that if I think about the features,

09:27.640 --> 09:30.520
I would argue are most universal about that phenomena,

09:30.520 --> 09:32.800
that there's any reason to think that a first encounter

09:32.800 --> 09:37.320
with another lineage or example of life

09:37.320 --> 09:38.880
would be antagonistic.

09:40.520 --> 09:45.520
I think, yeah, and I think there's this kind of assumption.

09:46.040 --> 09:49.360
I mean, going back to Neil deGrasse Tyson's quote,

09:49.360 --> 09:51.240
I mean, it kind of bothers me because there's a,

09:51.240 --> 09:52.120
I mean, I'm a physicist,

09:52.120 --> 09:53.720
so I know we have a lot of egos

09:53.720 --> 09:56.280
about how much we can describe the world,

09:56.280 --> 09:57.760
but that there's this like,

09:57.760 --> 09:59.720
because we understand fundamental physics so well,

09:59.720 --> 10:02.800
we understand alien life and we can kind of extrapolate.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.640
And I just think that we don't.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.840
And the quest there is really,

10:07.160 --> 10:09.880
to understand something totally new about the universe

10:09.880 --> 10:11.680
and that thing just happens to be us.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
I agree, I agree.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.880
There's something else more profound.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.000
I think Neil was just being, again,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.880
he's just trying to stir the pot.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.360
I would say from a contingency point of view,

10:21.360 --> 10:23.440
I want to know how many ways does the universe

10:23.440 --> 10:26.360
build structures, build memories, right?

10:26.360 --> 10:29.120
And then I wanna know if those memories

10:29.120 --> 10:30.080
can interact with each other.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.640
And if you have two different origins of life

10:33.640 --> 10:34.760
and then origins of intelligence

10:34.760 --> 10:36.720
and then these things become conscious,

10:37.600 --> 10:38.440
surely you wanna go and talk to them

10:38.440 --> 10:41.920
and figure out what commonalities you share.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.000
And it might be that we're just unable to conceive

10:44.000 --> 10:44.960
of what they're gonna look like,

10:44.960 --> 10:48.560
they're just gonna be completely different infrastructure.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.440
But surely we'll want to go and find out a map

10:50.440 --> 10:52.480
and surely curiosity is a property

10:52.480 --> 10:55.120
that evolution has made on earth

10:55.120 --> 10:57.160
and I can't see any reason

10:57.160 --> 10:58.440
that it won't happen elsewhere

10:58.440 --> 11:00.320
because curiosity probably exists

11:00.320 --> 11:03.760
because we want to find innovations in the environment,

11:03.760 --> 11:05.800
we want to use that information to help

11:07.080 --> 11:09.760
our technology and also curiosity

11:09.760 --> 11:10.800
is like planning for the future,

11:10.800 --> 11:12.120
are they gonna fight us?

11:12.120 --> 11:15.160
Are we gonna be able to trade with them?

11:15.160 --> 11:17.040
So I think that Neil's just, I don't know,

11:17.040 --> 11:19.360
maybe, I mean, give a shit,

11:19.360 --> 11:22.680
that's really, I think that's really down on earth, right?

11:22.680 --> 11:25.160
How would aliens categorize humans, do you think?

11:26.000 --> 11:26.840
How would we?

11:26.840 --> 11:28.200
So let's put it the other way around.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.160
Slime category?

11:29.160 --> 11:31.200
Maybe, no, no, no, maybe we could,

11:31.200 --> 11:33.280
the thing is a bit odd, right?

11:33.280 --> 11:35.520
Look at Instagram, Twitter,

11:35.560 --> 11:36.920
all these people taking selfies,

11:36.920 --> 11:38.480
I mean, does the universe

11:38.480 --> 11:40.640
is the ultimate state of consciousness,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.960
thinking beings that take photographs themselves

11:42.960 --> 11:44.280
and upload them to an internet

11:44.280 --> 11:47.040
with other thinking beings looking at each other's photos.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.680
So I think that they will be-

11:49.680 --> 11:51.920
What's wrong with that?

11:51.920 --> 11:53.920
I did not say there was anything wrong with it.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.480
Consciousness manifested at scale, selfies, Instagram.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.120
It's like the mirror test at scale.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.640
Yeah, I do think that curiosity

12:02.640 --> 12:04.320
is really the driving force

12:04.320 --> 12:06.000
of why we have our technology, right?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.600
If we weren't curious, we wouldn't have left the cave.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.640
So I think that,

12:11.720 --> 12:14.360
so I think that Neil's got it completely wrong, in fact,

12:14.360 --> 12:16.560
actually, of course they'd want to come here.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.960
It doesn't mean they are coming here.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.520
We've seen evidence for that.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.000
I guess we can argue about that, right?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.840
But I think that we want, I desperately,

12:24.840 --> 12:26.280
and I know that Sarah does too,

12:26.280 --> 12:28.480
but I won't speak for you, you're here.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.040
I desperately want to have missions

12:30.040 --> 12:32.680
to look for life in the solar system right now.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.840
I want to map life over the solar system,

12:34.840 --> 12:36.400
and then I want to understand how we can go

12:36.400 --> 12:39.960
and find life as quickly as possible at the nearest stars,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.720
and also at the same time, do it in the lab

12:41.720 --> 12:44.400
just to compensate, you know?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.720
So you're sure.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.440
Yeah, I just want to point on this.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.920
If you think about sort of what's driven

12:49.920 --> 12:53.400
the most like features of our own evolution as a species,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.080
and try to map that to alien species,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.240
I always think like optimism

12:56.240 --> 12:58.040
is what's going to get us furthest.

12:58.040 --> 12:59.760
And so I think a lot of people

12:59.760 --> 13:01.880
always think that it's like war and conflict

13:01.920 --> 13:03.680
is going to be the way that alien species

13:03.680 --> 13:06.080
will expand out into the cosmos.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.360
But if you just look at how we're doing it

13:08.360 --> 13:09.560
and how we talk about it,

13:09.560 --> 13:11.840
so is our future in space is always,

13:11.840 --> 13:14.360
you know, built from narratives of optimism.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.240
And so it seems to me that if intelligence

13:17.240 --> 13:18.680
does get out in the universe,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.040
that it's going to be more optimism and curiosity

13:21.040 --> 13:22.320
driving it than war and conflict

13:22.320 --> 13:24.360
because those things end up crushing you.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.040
So there might be some selective filter.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.520
Of course, this is me being an optimist.

13:29.520 --> 13:31.640
I'm a half full kind of person,

13:31.640 --> 13:35.520
but is it obvious that curiosity not obvious,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.020
but what do you think is curiosity

13:37.020 --> 13:38.880
a more powerful force in the universe

13:38.880 --> 13:43.280
than violence and the will to power?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.200
So, cause you said you frame curiosity

13:46.200 --> 13:50.160
as a way to also plan on how to avoid violence,

13:50.160 --> 13:52.520
which is an interesting frame of curiosity.

13:52.520 --> 13:55.840
But I could also argue that violence

13:55.840 --> 14:00.520
is a pretty productive way to operate in the world.

14:00.520 --> 14:01.360
Which is like,

14:01.360 --> 14:02.640
That's one way to protect yourself.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.840
The best defense is offense.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.880
I'm not qualified to answer this, but I'll have a go.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.640
I think violence, that's the summary of this podcast.

14:12.640 --> 14:13.640
Yeah.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.600
But maybe I would, let's not call it violence, but I call it erasure.

14:17.600 --> 14:23.240
So if you think about the way evolution works all the way, obviously talk about assembly

14:23.240 --> 14:24.480
theory, but I won't.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.240
So if you say you build, curiosity allows you to open up avenues, new graphs, right?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
New features you can play.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.560
The ability to erase those things allows you to start again and do some pruning.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.360
So the universe, I think curiosity gets you furthest.

14:40.360 --> 14:44.880
Curiosity gets you rockets that land, it gets you robots that can make drugs, it gets you

14:44.880 --> 14:48.640
poetry and art and communication.

14:48.640 --> 14:53.440
And then, I often think, wouldn't it be great in bureaucracy to have another world war,

14:53.440 --> 14:58.040
not literally a world war now, please no world war, but the equivalent so we can remove all

14:58.040 --> 14:59.800
the admin bureaucracy, right?

14:59.800 --> 15:03.440
All the admin violence, get rid of it and start again, do you know what I mean?

15:03.440 --> 15:06.360
Because you get layers and you get redundant systems built.

15:06.360 --> 15:14.120
So actually a reset, let's not call it violence, a reset in some aspects of our culture and

15:14.120 --> 15:20.160
our technology allows us to then build more important things without the, because how

15:20.160 --> 15:22.280
many, you know, how many cookies do I have to click on?

15:22.280 --> 15:27.720
How many extra clicks do I have in the future of my life that I could remove?

15:27.720 --> 15:35.520
And then a bit of a reset would allow us to start again and maybe that's how I suppose

15:35.520 --> 15:37.320
our encounter with aliens will be.

15:37.320 --> 15:41.280
Maybe they will fight with us and say, we're not as excited by you as we thought, we'll

15:41.280 --> 15:42.280
just get rid of you.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.120
Or they might want to reset Earth.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.120
Yeah, why not?

15:45.120 --> 15:47.440
To be like, let's see how the evolution runs again.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.840
This seems like they've, there's nothing new happening here.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.080
They're observing for a while.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.000
This is just not, let's keep it more fun.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.480
Let's start with a fish again.

15:57.480 --> 16:04.080
I like how you equated violence to resetting your cookies.

16:04.080 --> 16:08.160
I suppose that's the kind of violence in this, this is this modern world where words are

16:08.160 --> 16:09.800
violence resetting cookies.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.280
I don't know where that came from.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.320
I'm completely, yeah.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
That's poetic.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
Really?

16:14.320 --> 16:15.320
Okay.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.800
So let's talk about life.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.480
What is life?

16:19.480 --> 16:21.080
What is non-life?

16:21.080 --> 16:23.680
What is the line between life and non-life?

16:23.720 --> 16:28.160
Maybe at any point we can pull in ideas of assembly theory.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.200
How do we start to try to define life?

16:30.200 --> 16:37.880
For people listening, Sarah identifies as a physicist and Lee identifies as a chemist.

16:37.880 --> 16:44.960
Of course, they are very interdisciplinary in nature in general.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
What is life?

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
Sarah?

16:46.960 --> 16:52.000
I love asking that question because it's so absurdly big.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I know.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
I love it.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.080
It's my absolute favorite question in the whole universe.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.640
I think I have three ways of describing it right now and I like to say all three of them

17:01.640 --> 17:04.240
because people latch on to different facets of them.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.560
The whole idea of what Lee and I are trying to work on is not to try to define life but

17:08.560 --> 17:12.640
to try to find a more fundamental theory that explains what the phenomena we call life and

17:12.640 --> 17:14.400
then it should explain certain attributes.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.480
You end up having a really different framing than the way people usually talk.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.880
The way I talk about it, three different ways.

17:20.880 --> 17:25.400
Life is how information structures matter across space and time.

17:25.400 --> 17:31.040
Life is, I don't know, this one's from you actually, simple machines constructing more

17:31.040 --> 17:33.080
complex machines.

17:33.080 --> 17:38.720
The other one is the physics of existence, so to speak, which is life is the mechanism

17:38.720 --> 17:42.720
the universe has to explore the space of what's possible.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.720
That's my favorite.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.720
Can I add on to that?

17:46.720 --> 17:49.720
Can you say the physics one again?

17:49.720 --> 17:50.720
The physics of existence.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.160
Yeah, the physics of existence.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.880
I don't know what to call it.

17:53.880 --> 17:57.560
If you think of all the things that could exist, only certain things do exist.

17:57.560 --> 18:03.560
I think life is basically the universe's mechanism of bringing things into physically existing

18:03.560 --> 18:06.560
in the moment now.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.600
What's another one?

18:08.600 --> 18:13.080
We were debating this the other day, so if you think about a universe that has nothing

18:13.080 --> 18:16.720
in it, that's kind of hard to conceive of, right?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.360
This is where physicists really go wrong.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.000
They think of a universe with nothing in it.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
They can't.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.360
Non-existence is really hard to think of.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.040
Yeah, and then you think of a universe with everything in it.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.320
That's really hard, and you just have this white blob, right?

18:30.320 --> 18:31.600
This is everything.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.360
But the fact we have discrete stuff in the universe beyond, say, planets, so you've got

18:36.360 --> 18:38.600
stars, space, planet stuff, right?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.600
The boring stuff.

18:40.600 --> 18:47.240
But I would define life or say that life is where there are architectures, any architectures,

18:47.240 --> 18:52.760
and we should stop fixating on what is building the architectures to start with, and the fact

18:52.760 --> 18:57.880
that the universe has discrete things in it is completely mind-blowing.

18:57.880 --> 19:05.000
If you think about it for one second, the fact there's any objects at all, because for

19:05.000 --> 19:15.040
me the object is a proxy for a machine that built it, some information being moved around,

19:15.040 --> 19:20.160
actuation, sensing, getting resource, and building these objects.

19:20.160 --> 19:25.800
So for me, everyone's been obsessing about the machine, but I'm like, forget the machine.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.480
Let's see the objects.

19:27.480 --> 19:32.400
And I think in a way that assembly theory, we realized maybe a few months ago that assembly

19:32.400 --> 19:38.360
theory actually does account for the soul in the objects, not mystically like say Sheldrake's

19:38.360 --> 19:43.000
morphic resonance or Leibniz's monodology, seeing souls in things.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.600
So when you see an object, and I've said this before, but this object is evidence of

19:47.600 --> 19:51.320
thought, and then there's a lineage of those objects.

19:51.320 --> 19:57.360
So I think what is fascinating is that, you put it much more elegantly, but the barrier

19:57.360 --> 20:02.760
between life and non-life is accruing enough memories to then actuate.

20:02.760 --> 20:06.240
So what that means is there are contingency, there are things that happen in the universe,

20:06.240 --> 20:10.880
get trapped, these memories then have a causal effect on the future, and then when you get

20:10.880 --> 20:16.360
those concentrated in a machine and you're actually able in real time, able to integrate

20:16.360 --> 20:22.800
the past, the present with the future and do stuff, that's when you are most alive.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
You being the machine.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
Yes.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
Wait a minute.

20:25.800 --> 20:27.040
Why is the object?

20:27.040 --> 20:34.360
So one of the ways to define life that Sarah said is simple machines creating complex machines.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.480
So there's a million questions there.

20:37.480 --> 20:41.320
So how the hell does a simple machine create a complex machine?

20:41.320 --> 20:42.960
By mutation.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.520
So this is what we were talking about at the beginning, you have the minimum replicator,

20:45.520 --> 20:46.520
so molecule.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.880
So this is what I was trying to convince Sarah of the mechanism, get there years ago, I think,

20:49.880 --> 20:53.980
but then you've been building on it and saying, you have a small, you have a molecule that

20:53.980 --> 20:59.120
can copy itself, but then there has to be some variability, otherwise it's not going

20:59.120 --> 21:00.120
to get more functional.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.240
So you need to add bits on.

21:02.240 --> 21:06.000
So you have a minimum molecule that can copy itself, but then it can add bits on and that

21:06.040 --> 21:07.360
can be copied as well.

21:07.360 --> 21:14.440
And those add ons can give you additional function to be able to acquire more stuff

21:14.440 --> 21:15.880
to exist.

21:15.880 --> 21:21.280
So existence is weird, but the fact that there is existence is why there is life.

21:21.280 --> 21:25.920
And that's why I realized a few days ago that there must be, that's why alien life must

21:25.920 --> 21:28.920
be everywhere because there is existence.

21:28.920 --> 21:33.840
Is there like a conservation of cheeky stuff happening?

21:33.840 --> 21:37.920
So like, how can you keep injecting more complex things?

21:37.920 --> 21:46.200
Like doesn't the machine that creates the object need to be as or more powerful than

21:46.200 --> 21:48.520
the things it creates?

21:48.520 --> 21:51.880
So how can you get complexity from simplicity?

21:51.880 --> 21:57.800
So the way you get complexity from simplicity is that you, I'm just making this up, but

21:57.800 --> 22:01.320
this is kind of my notion, and you have a large volume of stuff, so you're able to get

22:02.320 --> 22:05.640
seeds, if you like, random cues from the environment.

22:05.640 --> 22:12.200
So you just use those objects to basically write on your tape, ones and zeros, whatever.

22:12.200 --> 22:19.800
And that is necessarily rich, complex, okay, but it has a low assembliness.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.680
But even though it has a high assembly number, we can talk about that.

22:22.680 --> 22:28.880
But then when you start to then integrate that all into a smaller volume as over time

22:28.880 --> 22:33.040
and then you become more autonomous, you then make the transition.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.760
I don't know what you think about that.

22:34.760 --> 22:39.920
I think the easiest way to think about it is actually, which I know is a concept you

22:39.920 --> 22:43.160
hate, but I also hate it, which is entropy, but people are more familiar with entropy

22:43.160 --> 22:45.920
than what we talk about in assembly theory.

22:45.920 --> 22:51.920
And also the idea that like say physics as we know it involves objects that don't exist

22:51.920 --> 22:55.800
across time, or as we would say, low memory objects.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.600
So one of the key distinctions that is-

22:58.600 --> 22:59.600
Low memory objects.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.600
Yeah.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.600
So physics is all-

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
Well, physicists are low memory objects.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.600
Low memory objects.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
But-

23:04.600 --> 23:09.880
The physicists are creators of low memory objects or manipulators of low memory objects.

23:09.880 --> 23:10.880
Yep, absolutely.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
It's a very nice way.

23:11.880 --> 23:12.880
Okay, sorry.

23:12.880 --> 23:13.880
Sorry to keep interrupting.

23:13.880 --> 23:14.880
No, it's fine.

23:14.880 --> 23:15.880
I like it too.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.880
It's very funny.

23:16.880 --> 23:22.240
But I think it's a good way of phrasing it because I think this kind of idea we have

23:22.240 --> 23:28.240
in assembly theory is that physics as we know it has basically removed time as being

23:28.240 --> 23:33.960
a physical observable of an object, and the argument I would make is that when you look

23:33.960 --> 23:39.400
at things like water bottles or us, we're actually things that exist that have a large

23:39.400 --> 23:41.100
extent in time.

23:41.100 --> 23:46.560
So we actually have a physical size and time, and we measure that with something called

23:46.560 --> 23:53.520
the assembly index in molecules, but presumably everyone should have sort of a- Do you want

23:53.520 --> 23:54.960
to explain what assembly-

23:54.960 --> 23:56.560
Yeah, you know what?

23:56.560 --> 23:59.720
Let's step back and start at the beginning.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.720
What is assembly theory?

24:00.720 --> 24:02.880
Lee sent me some slides.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.600
There's a big sexy paper coming out probably.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Maybe.

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
I don't know.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.600
We've almost finished it.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.720
Almost finished it.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.720
That's also a summary of science.

24:13.720 --> 24:14.720
We're almost done.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.720
Yes.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.720
Well, no, no, we're almost done.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.720
It's the history of science.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.560
We are ready to start an interesting discussion with our peers.

24:21.560 --> 24:22.560
Right.

24:22.560 --> 24:26.120
If you're the machine that created the object, then we'll see what the object takes us.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.120
All right.

24:27.120 --> 24:28.520
So what is assembly theory?

24:28.520 --> 24:29.520
Yeah.

24:29.520 --> 24:34.280
Well, I think the easiest way for people to understand it is to think about assembly and

24:34.280 --> 24:36.480
molecules, although the theory is very general.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.280
It doesn't just apply to molecules.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.600
And this was really Lee's insight, so it's kind of funny that I'm explaining it.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
I'll mark you.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
Okay.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
All right.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
I'm ready.

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
I'm ready.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
You can tell me where I get the check marks minus, but-

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
It's your theory as well.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
Yeah, I know.

24:50.440 --> 24:55.520
Imagine a molecule, and then you can break the molecule apart into elementary building

24:55.520 --> 24:56.520
blocks.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
They happen to be bonds.

24:57.520 --> 25:00.200
And then you can think of all the ways, for molecular assembly theory, you can think of

25:00.200 --> 25:02.440
all the ways of building up the original molecule.

25:02.440 --> 25:07.200
So there's all these paths that you can assemble it, and the rules of assembly is you can use

25:07.200 --> 25:09.520
pieces that have been generated already.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.360
So it has this recursive property to it.

25:12.360 --> 25:15.260
And so that's where memory comes into assembly theory.

25:15.260 --> 25:19.480
And then the assembly index is the shortest path in that space.

25:19.480 --> 25:23.280
So it's supposed to be the minimal amount of history that the universe has to undergo

25:23.280 --> 25:25.720
in order to assemble that particular object.

25:25.720 --> 25:30.760
And the reason that this is significant is we figured out how to measure that with a

25:30.760 --> 25:33.680
mass spec in the lab.

25:33.680 --> 25:38.680
And we had this conjecture that if that minimal number of steps was sufficiently large, it

25:38.680 --> 25:41.920
would indicate that you required a machine or a system that had information about how

25:41.920 --> 25:45.160
to assemble that specific object, because the combinatorial space of possibilities is

25:45.160 --> 25:49.120
getting exponentially large as the assembly index is increasing.

25:49.760 --> 25:57.080
Sorry to interrupt, but so that means there's a sufficiently high assembly index that if

25:57.080 --> 26:05.120
observed in an object is an indicator that something lifelike created it, or is the object

26:05.120 --> 26:06.840
itself lifelike?

26:06.840 --> 26:07.840
Both.

26:07.840 --> 26:12.840
But you might want to make the distinction that a water bottle is not life, but it would

26:12.840 --> 26:18.480
still be a signature that you were in that domain of physics, and I might be alive.

26:18.840 --> 26:27.000
So there will be potentially a lot of arguments about where the line, at which assembly index

26:27.000 --> 26:28.880
does interesting stuff start to happen?

26:28.880 --> 26:32.800
The point is we can make all the arguments, but it should be experimentally observable.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.240
And Lee can talk more about that part of it.

26:34.240 --> 26:39.240
But the point I want to make about it is there was always this intuition that I had that

26:39.240 --> 26:43.440
there should be some complexity threshold in the universe above which you would start

26:43.440 --> 26:47.080
to say whatever physics governs life actually becomes operative.

26:47.080 --> 26:50.920
And I think about it a little bit like we have Planck's constant, and we have the

26:50.920 --> 26:56.200
fine structure constant, and then this sort of assembly threshold is basically another

26:56.200 --> 26:59.680
sort of potentially constant of nature.

26:59.680 --> 27:06.000
It might depend on specific features of the system, which we debate about sometimes.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.520
But then when you're past that, you have to have some other explanation than the current

27:10.520 --> 27:15.480
explanations we have in physics, because now you're in high memory.

27:15.480 --> 27:20.240
And those actually require time for them to exist, and time becomes a physical variable.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.480
The path to the creation of the object is the memory, so you need to consider that.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.520
Yeah, but the point is that's a feature of the object.

27:29.520 --> 27:36.520
So when I think of all the things in this room, you know, we see the projection of them

27:36.520 --> 27:40.120
as a water bottle, but assembly theory would say that this is a causal graph of all the

27:40.120 --> 27:41.920
ways the universe can create this thing.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.560
That's what it is as an object.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.360
And we're all interacting, a causal graph, and most of the creativity in the biosphere

27:47.360 --> 27:52.720
is because a lot of the objects that exist now are huge in their structure across time.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.400
Four billion years of evolution to get to us.

27:55.400 --> 28:03.000
Is it possible to look at me and infer the history that led to me as a human?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.040
You as an individual might be hard.

28:05.040 --> 28:10.540
You as a representative of a population of objects that have high assembly with similar

28:10.580 --> 28:14.940
causal history and structure that you can communicate with, i.e. other humans, you can

28:14.940 --> 28:15.940
infer a lot probably.

28:15.940 --> 28:16.940
Yeah, also with them.

28:16.940 --> 28:21.060
Which we do, genomically even, I mean, it's not like we have a lot of information in us,

28:21.060 --> 28:23.380
we can reconstruct histories from.

28:23.380 --> 28:24.540
Assembly is saying something slightly deeper.

28:24.540 --> 28:28.140
Yeah, one thing to add, I mean, it's not just about the object, but the objects that occur

28:28.140 --> 28:32.220
and not just objects with high assembly number, because you can have random things that have

28:32.220 --> 28:36.060
a high assembly number, but they must have, there must be a number of identical copies.

28:36.060 --> 28:40.180
So you know you're getting away from the random, because you could take a snapshot.

28:40.820 --> 28:45.300
It's not that I hate entropy, I love entropy when used correctly, but it's about the problem

28:45.300 --> 28:50.180
with entropy is you have to have a labeler, and so you can label the beginning and the

28:50.180 --> 28:52.620
end, the start and the finish.

28:52.620 --> 28:56.620
What you can do in assembly is say, oh, I have a number of objects in abundance, they

28:56.620 --> 29:01.340
all have these features, and then you can infer, and one of the things that we debated

29:01.340 --> 29:05.940
a lot, particularly during lockdown, because I almost went insane trying to produce the

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
assembly equation.

29:06.940 --> 29:10.780
I came up with the assembly equation, I had, just imagine this, so you have this string

29:10.780 --> 29:17.380
where, oh, actually it makes me sick trying to remember it, it was so, it did my head

29:17.380 --> 29:19.100
in for a long time.

29:19.100 --> 29:25.540
Yeah, because I couldn't, so if you just have a string of say, words, say, you know, a series

29:25.540 --> 29:30.740
of words, series of letters, so you just have A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C, D, D, D, and you find

29:30.740 --> 29:36.500
that object, and you just have four As, four Bs, four Cs, four Ds together, boom, then,

29:37.260 --> 29:40.860
you measured that, so you physically measured that string of letters.

29:40.860 --> 29:46.860
Then what you could do is you can infer sub-graphs of maybe the four As, the four Bs, the four

29:46.860 --> 29:51.620
Cs, and the four Cs, but you don't see them in the real world, you just infer them.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.820
And I really got stuck with that, because there's a problem, to try and work out what's

29:55.820 --> 30:01.300
the difference between a long, you know, physical object and this assembly space of the objects,

30:01.300 --> 30:05.860
so that we realized the best way to put that is infer in time.

30:05.860 --> 30:10.500
So, although we can't infer your entire history, we know at some point the four As were made,

30:10.500 --> 30:14.620
the four Bs were made, the four Cs were made, the four Ds were made, and they all got added

30:14.620 --> 30:15.620
together.

30:15.620 --> 30:20.300
And that's one really interesting thing that's come out of the theory, but the killer, when

30:20.300 --> 30:28.740
we knew we were going beyond standard complexity theories, which was incredibly successful,

30:28.740 --> 30:33.500
is that we realized we could start to measure these things for real across domains.

30:33.540 --> 30:38.860
So the assembly index is actually an intrinsic property of all stuff that you can break into

30:38.860 --> 30:45.180
components, particularly molecules are good because you can break them up into smaller

30:45.180 --> 30:47.340
molecules, into atoms.

30:47.340 --> 30:51.220
The challenge will be making that more general across all the domains, but we're working

30:51.220 --> 30:53.100
on it right now, and I think the theory will do that.

30:53.100 --> 30:58.900
So components, domains, so you're talking about basically measuring the complexity of

30:58.940 --> 31:04.540
an object in, what, biology, chemistry, physics, that's what you mean by domains.

31:04.540 --> 31:10.140
Complexity of tests, complexity of computers, complexity of memes, you know.

31:10.140 --> 31:11.140
Memes?

31:11.140 --> 31:12.140
Yep.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.140
What is that, ideas?

31:13.140 --> 31:14.140
Yeah.

31:14.140 --> 31:15.140
I mean, so one of the-

31:15.140 --> 31:17.100
Ideas are objects in assembly theory, though.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.100
Yeah.

31:18.100 --> 31:19.100
They are.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.100
They're physical things.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.100
They're just pictures of the causal graph.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.700
I mean, the fact I can talk to you right now is because we're exchanging the structure

31:23.700 --> 31:27.340
of our assembly space.

31:27.380 --> 31:33.420
So conversation is the exchanging structures in assembly space.

31:33.420 --> 31:35.220
What is assembly space?

31:35.220 --> 31:39.100
When I started working on Origins of Life, I was writing about something called top-down

31:39.100 --> 31:42.980
causation, which a lot of philosophers are interested in and people that worry about

31:42.980 --> 31:43.980
the mind-body problem.

31:43.980 --> 31:49.860
But the whole idea is, you know, if we have, you know, the microscopic world of physics

31:49.860 --> 31:54.300
is causally complete, it seems like there's no room for higher-level causes, like our

31:54.340 --> 31:56.500
thoughts to actually have any impact on the world.

31:56.500 --> 32:01.620
And that didn't- that seems problematic when you get to studying life and mind because

32:01.620 --> 32:06.900
it does seem that quote unquote emergent properties do matter to matter.

32:06.900 --> 32:11.860
And so- and then there's this other sort of paradoxical situation where information

32:11.860 --> 32:13.180
looks like it's disembodied.

32:13.180 --> 32:16.500
So we talk about information, like it can just move from any physical system to any

32:16.500 --> 32:21.940
other physical system, and it doesn't require- like you don't have to specify anything

32:21.940 --> 32:24.460
about the substrate to talk about information.

32:24.460 --> 32:29.060
And then there's also- the way we talk about mathematics is also disembodied, right, like

32:29.060 --> 32:31.580
the platonic world of forms.

32:31.580 --> 32:36.460
And I think all of those things are hinting that we really don't know how to think about

32:36.460 --> 32:40.180
abstractions as physical things.

32:40.180 --> 32:45.140
And really, I think what assembly theory is pointing to is what we're missing there is

32:45.140 --> 32:47.240
the dimension of time.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.800
And if you actually look at an object being extended across time, what we call information

32:52.800 --> 32:57.080
and the things that look abstract are things that are entangled in the histories of those

32:57.080 --> 32:58.080
objects.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.180
They're features of the overlapping assembly space.

33:00.180 --> 33:05.640
So they look abstract because they're not, you know, part of the current structure, but

33:05.640 --> 33:09.160
they're part of the structure if you thought about it as like the philosophical concept

33:09.160 --> 33:14.080
of a hyperobject, an object that's too big in time for us to actually resolve.

33:14.560 --> 33:19.240
So I think information's physical, it's just physical in time, not in space.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.440
Too hyperobject, too difficult for us to resolve.

33:22.440 --> 33:28.160
So we're supposed to think about- of life as this thing that stretches through time

33:28.160 --> 33:32.520
and there's a causation chain that led to that thing.

33:32.520 --> 33:37.040
And then you're trying to measure something with the assembly index about-

33:37.040 --> 33:41.860
The assembly index is the ordering- like you could think of it as like a partial ordering

33:41.860 --> 33:44.000
of all the things that can happen.

33:44.000 --> 33:48.360
So in thermodynamics, we coarse-grain things by temperature and pressure.

33:48.360 --> 33:53.000
In assembly theory, we coarse-grain by the number of copies of an object and the assembly

33:53.000 --> 33:56.600
index, which is basically, if you think of the space of all possible things, it's like

33:56.600 --> 34:00.640
a depth of how far you've gone into that space and how much time was required to get there.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
In the shortest possible version.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.320
The shortest possible version.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.200
Not average, because can't you just 3-D-

34:07.200 --> 34:09.680
You're going to kill me with that question.

34:09.680 --> 34:10.680
Oh.

34:10.680 --> 34:11.680
Not 3-D.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.680
Can't you always 3-D print the thing?

34:14.360 --> 34:18.960
No, because I had such fights, so Sarah's team and my team are writing this paper at

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
the moment and-

34:19.960 --> 34:21.520
It's so funny.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.280
I think we kind of share the- at the beginning, you were like, no, that's not right.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.280
Oh, yes, right.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.280
And we're doing this for a bit.

34:26.280 --> 34:30.440
And then the problem is when you build a theory and build the intuition, there's some certain

34:30.440 --> 34:35.800
features of the theory that almost felt like I was being religious about saying, right,

34:35.800 --> 34:36.800
you have to do this.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.800
A good assembly theorist does this, does this, does this.

34:40.920 --> 34:45.040
And Sarah's postdoc, Daniel, and my postdoc, Abhishek, and they were both-

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
They were both brilliant.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.440
They're brilliant, but they were both like, no, we don't, we don't buy that.

34:49.440 --> 34:55.120
And I was like, it is, they were like, well, Lee, actually, I thought you were the first

34:55.120 --> 34:59.400
to say that, you know, if you can't explain it, and you can't do an experiment that doesn't

34:59.400 --> 35:00.400
exist.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.400
And that saved me.

35:01.400 --> 35:05.080
And I said to Abhishek, Abhishek's my postdoc in Glasgow, Daniel was Sarah's postdoc in

35:05.080 --> 35:06.080
ASU.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.040
I was like, I have the experimental data.

35:09.040 --> 35:13.240
So when I basically take the molecules and chop them up in the mass spec, the assembly

35:13.240 --> 35:16.880
number is never the average, it's always the shortest, it's an intrinsic property.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.360
And then the penny dropped for Abhishek, I said, okay, because I had these things that

35:20.360 --> 35:24.440
we had to believe to start with or to trust, and then we've done the math, and it comes

35:24.440 --> 35:29.320
out and they now have the shortest path, actually, it's up, it explains why the shortest path.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.920
Here's why the shortest path is important, not the average.

35:31.920 --> 35:37.240
The shortest path needs you to identify when the universe has basically got a memory, not

35:37.240 --> 35:38.240
an average.

35:38.440 --> 35:43.880
What you want to be able to do is to say, what is the minimum number of features that

35:43.880 --> 35:45.600
I want to be able to see in the universe?

35:45.600 --> 35:52.160
When I find those features, I know the universe has had a coherent memory, and it's basically

35:52.160 --> 35:54.280
alive.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.840
And so that gives you the lower bound.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.640
So that's like, of course, there's going to be other paths, we can be more ridiculous,

36:00.640 --> 36:01.640
right?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.540
We can have other parts, but it's just the minimum.

36:03.540 --> 36:08.740
So probabilistically, at the beginning, because assembly theory was built as a measure for

36:08.740 --> 36:11.940
biosignatures, I needed to go there.

36:11.940 --> 36:13.860
And then I realized it was intrinsic.

36:13.860 --> 36:17.140
And then Sarah realized it was intrinsic and these hyperobjects were coming and we were

36:17.140 --> 36:19.940
kind of fusing that notions together.

36:19.940 --> 36:25.740
And then the team were like, yeah, but if I have enough energy, and I have enough resources,

36:25.740 --> 36:29.160
I might not take the shortest path, I might go a bit longer, I might take a really long

36:29.160 --> 36:33.180
path, because it allows me then to do something else.

36:33.180 --> 36:38.300
So what you do is, let's say I've got two different objects, A and B, and they both

36:38.300 --> 36:40.460
have different shortest paths to get them.

36:40.460 --> 36:44.660
But then if you want to make A and B together, they will have a compromise.

36:44.660 --> 36:49.740
So in the joint assembly space, that might be an average, but actually it's the shortest

36:49.740 --> 36:54.780
way you can make both A and B with a minimum amount of resource in time.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.940
So suddenly you then layer these things up.

36:56.940 --> 37:03.820
And so the average becomes not important, but it's as you literally overlap those sets,

37:03.820 --> 37:05.460
you get a new shortest path.

37:05.460 --> 37:09.220
And so what we realized time and time again, when we're doing the math, the shortest path

37:09.220 --> 37:14.340
is intrinsic, is fundamental, and is measurable, which is kind of mind blowing.

37:14.340 --> 37:20.140
So what we're talking about some basic ingredients, maybe we'll talk about that, what those basic

37:20.140 --> 37:25.780
ingredients could be and how many steps, when you say shortest path, how many steps it takes

37:25.900 --> 37:32.300
to turn those basic ingredients into the final meal.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.940
So how to make a pizza, what's the shortest way to make a pizza?

37:34.940 --> 37:35.940
Or a pie.

37:35.940 --> 37:36.940
An apple pie.

37:36.940 --> 37:37.940
An apple pie.

37:37.940 --> 37:38.940
That's right.

37:38.940 --> 37:39.940
And a pie together.

37:39.940 --> 37:40.940
Or a scratch.

37:40.940 --> 37:41.940
Yeah.

37:41.940 --> 37:45.140
So there's a lot of ways.

37:45.140 --> 37:49.620
There's the shortest way, and you take the full spectrum of ways, and there's probably

37:49.620 --> 37:56.500
an average like duration for a noob to make an apple pie.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.460
Is the average interesting still?

37:58.460 --> 38:05.060
If you measure the average length of the path to assemble a thing, does that tell you something

38:05.060 --> 38:14.020
about the way nature usually does it versus something fundamental about the object, which

38:14.020 --> 38:16.460
I think is what you're aiming at with the assembly index?

38:16.460 --> 38:17.460
Yeah.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.540
I mean, look, we all have to quantify things.

38:19.540 --> 38:21.260
The minimum path gives you the lower bounds.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.460
You know you're detecting something.

38:22.460 --> 38:24.180
You know you're inferring something.

38:24.180 --> 38:29.660
The average tells you about really how the objects are existing in the ecosystem or the

38:29.660 --> 38:38.860
technology, and there has to be more paths explored because then you can happen upon

38:38.860 --> 38:41.300
other memories and then condense them down.

38:41.300 --> 38:45.260
I'm not making too much sense, but if you look and say, let's just say, I mean, maybe

38:45.260 --> 38:47.380
we're going to get to alien civilizations later, right?

38:47.700 --> 38:54.500
I would argue very strongly that alien civilization A and alien civilization B, they're different

38:54.500 --> 38:58.020
assembly spaces, so they're kind of going to be a bit messed up if they happen to come

38:58.020 --> 39:02.900
one another, only when they find some joint overlap in their technology, because if aliens

39:02.900 --> 39:07.260
come to us and they don't share any of the causal graph we've showed, but hopefully they

39:07.260 --> 39:12.500
share the periodic table and some other bonds and things, so we're going to have to really

39:12.540 --> 39:17.860
think about the language to talk to us aliens by inferring, by using assembly theory to

39:17.860 --> 39:24.860
infer their language, their technology, and other bits and bobs, and the shortest path

39:24.860 --> 39:25.860
will help you do that quickly.

39:25.860 --> 39:26.860
All right.

39:26.860 --> 39:32.340
So all aliens in this causality graphs have a common ancestor in the...

39:32.340 --> 39:35.780
If the building blocks are the same, which means they live in the same universe as us.

39:35.780 --> 39:38.580
So it depends on how far back in time you go, though.

39:38.580 --> 39:42.060
But the universe has all the same building blocks.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.900
And we have to assume that.

39:45.900 --> 39:53.580
So there's not different classes of causality graphs, right?

39:53.580 --> 39:58.740
The universe doesn't just say, like, here, you get the red causality graph and you get

39:58.740 --> 39:59.740
the blue one.

39:59.740 --> 40:04.700
These basic ingredients and they're geographically constrained or constrained in space or time

40:04.700 --> 40:06.260
or something like that.

40:06.260 --> 40:11.860
They're constrained in time because only by the virtue of the fact that you need enough

40:11.860 --> 40:14.740
time to have passed for some things to exist.

40:14.740 --> 40:17.300
So the universe has to be big enough in time for some things.

40:17.300 --> 40:20.260
So just the one point on the shortest path versus the average path, which I think will

40:20.260 --> 40:24.980
get to this, is you had a nice way of saying it's like the minimal compression is the shortest

40:24.980 --> 40:29.100
path for the universe to produce that, but it's also like the first time in the ordering

40:29.100 --> 40:32.660
of events that you might expect to see that object.

40:32.660 --> 40:39.260
But the average path tells you something about the actual steps that were realized.

40:39.260 --> 40:43.860
And that becomes an emergent property of that object's interaction with other objects.

40:43.860 --> 40:47.020
So it's not an intrinsic feature of that object, it's a feature of the interactions

40:47.020 --> 40:48.020
with other things.

40:48.020 --> 40:51.660
And so one of the nice features of assembly is you've basically gotten rid of, you just

40:51.660 --> 40:54.900
look at the things that exist and you've gotten rid of the mechanisms for constructing

40:54.900 --> 41:01.980
them in some sense, like the machines are not as important in the current construction

41:01.980 --> 41:08.140
of the theory, although I would like to bridge it to some ideas about constructors.

41:08.140 --> 41:13.620
But then you can only communicate with things as Lee was saying, if you have some overlap

41:13.620 --> 41:15.140
in the past history.

41:15.140 --> 41:20.460
So if you had an alien species that had absolutely no overlap, then there would be no means of

41:20.460 --> 41:21.460
communication.

41:21.460 --> 41:26.580
But as we become, as we progress further and further in time and more things become possible

41:26.580 --> 41:31.940
because the assembly spaces are larger, because you can have a larger assembly space in terms

41:31.940 --> 41:36.420
of index and also just the size of the space because it's exponentially growing, then

41:36.420 --> 41:38.300
more things can happen in the future.

41:38.300 --> 41:42.540
And the example I like to give is actually when we made first contact with gravitational

41:42.540 --> 41:48.220
waves because that's an alien phenomena that's been permeating our planet, not alien in life

41:48.220 --> 41:52.020
phenomena, but alien like something we had never knew existed.

41:52.020 --> 41:57.460
It's been like there's gravitational waves rippling through this room right now.

41:57.540 --> 42:03.300
But we had to advance to the level of Einstein writing down his theory of relativity and

42:03.300 --> 42:08.620
then 100 years of technological development to even quote unquote see that phenomena.

42:08.620 --> 42:15.420
So the OK to see that phenomena, our causal graph have to start intersecting.

42:15.420 --> 42:19.100
Yeah, we needed the idea to emerge first, the abstraction, right?

42:19.100 --> 42:23.820
And then we had to build the technology that could actually observe features of that abstraction.

42:23.820 --> 42:29.420
So the nice promising thing is over time, the graph can grow so it can start overlapping eventually.

42:29.420 --> 42:34.220
Yeah, so the interesting feature of that graph is there was an event 1.4 billion years away

42:34.220 --> 42:41.540
of a black hole merger that we detected on our detector and now suddenly we're connected

42:41.540 --> 42:46.220
through this communication channel with this distant event in our universe that if you

42:46.220 --> 42:50.120
think about 1.4 billion years ago, what was happening on this planet or even further back

42:50.120 --> 42:55.920
in time that there is common physics underlying all of those events, but even for those two

42:55.920 --> 42:56.920
events to communicate with.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.920
Now I understand what you were going on about the other week.

42:58.920 --> 42:59.920
Yeah, I'm sorry.

42:59.920 --> 43:03.240
This is a really abstract example.

43:03.240 --> 43:05.360
Your causal graphs are not overlapping.

43:05.360 --> 43:09.760
Well, let's just say now our causal graphs are overlapping in the deep past.

43:09.760 --> 43:10.760
Oh, I like it.

43:10.760 --> 43:11.760
So you made it.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.760
I totally missed it.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.760
Oh, the 1.6 billion.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.760
Yeah.

43:14.760 --> 43:15.760
You made a connection with it.

43:15.760 --> 43:16.760
No, I do like that.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.760
No, you can tell me what your epiphany is now.

43:17.760 --> 43:18.760
This is good.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.400
And I should get the jokes before 30 seconds after, so.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.400
Oh, I get it now.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.400
The joke from two minutes ago.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.400
I'm slow on the uptake here.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.280
I wasn't able to comprehend what you were talking about when saying the channel communicating

43:32.280 --> 43:33.280
to the past.

43:33.280 --> 43:40.400
But what you're saying is we were able to infer what happened 1.4 billion years ago.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.640
We detected the gravity wave.

43:41.640 --> 43:45.000
I mean, I think it's amazing that, you know, at that time we weren't even, we were just

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
becoming multicellular.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
Right?

43:47.000 --> 43:48.560
It's like insane.

43:49.360 --> 43:55.240
And then we progressed in multicellularity through to technology and built the detector

43:55.240 --> 43:59.000
and then for, you know, and then we just extrapolate backwards.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.720
So although we didn't do anything back to the graph back in time, we understood this

44:02.720 --> 44:04.600
existence then overlapped going forward.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
Well, that's because our graphs are larger.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
Yeah.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.600
But that means that has a consequence.

44:08.600 --> 44:15.120
One of the things I was trying to say is like I'm, I think, I don't know, Sarah might be,

44:15.240 --> 44:19.760
she can correct me, information first, and I'm an object first kind of guy.

44:19.760 --> 44:23.640
So I mean, as things that get constructed, there has to be this transition in random

44:23.640 --> 44:24.640
constructions.

44:24.640 --> 44:31.920
So when the construct, the object that's being constructed by the process bakes in that memory

44:31.920 --> 44:35.680
and those memories then add on and add on and add on.

44:35.680 --> 44:40.720
So as it becomes more competent and life is about taking those memories and compressing

44:40.720 --> 44:43.880
them, increasing their autonomy.

44:43.880 --> 44:47.600
And so I think that, you know, like the cell that we have in biology on earth is our way

44:47.600 --> 44:48.600
of doing that.

44:48.600 --> 44:52.640
That really the maximum ability to take memories and to act on the future.

44:52.640 --> 44:55.240
Oh, I think that's mathematics.

44:55.240 --> 44:58.080
No, mathematics doesn't exist.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.520
No, but that's the point.

44:59.520 --> 45:02.040
The point is that abstractions do exist.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.200
They're real physical things.

45:03.200 --> 45:10.680
We call them abstractions, but the point about mathematics that I think is, so I don't disagree.

45:10.680 --> 45:15.120
I think you're object first and I'm information first, but I think I'm only information first

45:15.120 --> 45:20.680
in the sense that I think the thing that we need to explain is what abstractions are and

45:20.680 --> 45:22.240
what they are as physical things.

45:22.240 --> 45:26.080
Because of all of human history, we've thought that there were these properties that are

45:26.080 --> 45:32.520
disembodied, exist outside of the universe, and really they do exist in the universe and

45:32.520 --> 45:35.000
we just don't understand what their physics is.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.840
So I think mathematics is a really good example.

45:36.840 --> 45:43.160
We do theoretical physics with math, but imagine doing physics of math and then thinking about

45:43.160 --> 45:45.160
math as a physical object.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.360
Math is super interesting.

45:46.360 --> 45:49.820
I think this is why we think it describes reality so well, because it's the most copyable

45:49.820 --> 45:51.000
kind of information.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.880
It retains its properties when you move it between physical media, which means that it's

45:54.880 --> 45:59.880
very deep and so it seems to describe the universe really well, but it probably is because

45:59.880 --> 46:03.360
it's information that's very deep in our past.

46:03.360 --> 46:09.440
We invented a way of communicating it very effectively between us.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.440
Isn't math more fundamental?

46:11.440 --> 46:17.760
Isn't the assembly of the graph, isn't basically, I sound completely boring, it's like assembly

46:17.760 --> 46:22.320
theory invented math, but it did, it has to be.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.000
Okay.

46:24.000 --> 46:29.160
So what is math exactly?

46:29.160 --> 46:38.160
It's a nice simplification, a simple description of what?

46:38.160 --> 46:41.240
So we have a computer scientist, a physicist, and a chemist here.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.240
Walk into a bar.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.680
I think the chemist is going to define math and you guys can correct me.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.680
Go for it.

46:46.680 --> 46:47.680
I would say-

46:47.680 --> 46:48.680
Lay it honestly.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.880
We're ready.

46:50.880 --> 46:58.440
I think the ability to label objects and place them into classes and then do operations on

46:58.440 --> 47:01.120
the objects is what math is.

47:01.120 --> 47:07.120
So on that point, what does it mean to be object first versus information first?

47:07.120 --> 47:11.320
So what's the difference between object and information when you get to that low fundamental

47:11.320 --> 47:12.320
level?

47:12.320 --> 47:14.120
Well, I might change my view.

47:14.120 --> 47:21.720
So I'm stuff first, the stuff, and then when stuff becomes objects, it has to invent information

47:21.720 --> 47:24.920
and then the information acts on more stuff and becomes more objects.

47:24.920 --> 47:31.680
So I think there is a transition to information that occurs when you go from stuff to object.

47:31.680 --> 47:32.680
Information is emergent.

47:32.680 --> 47:35.160
Not emergent.

47:35.160 --> 47:40.500
Information is actionable memories from the universe.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.920
So when memories become actionable, that's information.

47:44.920 --> 47:47.720
But there's always memory, but it's not actionable.

47:47.720 --> 47:48.720
Yeah.

47:48.720 --> 47:49.720
And then it's not information.

47:49.720 --> 47:50.720
Great.

47:50.720 --> 47:52.400
And actionable is what you can create.

47:52.400 --> 47:53.760
You can use it.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.560
If you can't use it, then it's not information.

47:55.560 --> 47:59.560
If you can't transmit it, if it doesn't have any causal consequence.

47:59.560 --> 48:00.560
Falls in the forest.

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
I don't understand.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.640
Why is that not information?

48:03.640 --> 48:06.640
It's not information.

48:06.640 --> 48:07.640
It's stuff.

48:07.640 --> 48:10.160
It's stuff happening, but it's not causal.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.160
Yeah.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.160
Yeah.

48:12.160 --> 48:13.160
This is cool.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.160
It's happening.

48:14.160 --> 48:17.160
The happening requires information.

48:17.160 --> 48:18.160
Stuff is always happening.

48:18.160 --> 48:19.160
No.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.320
This is where the physicists and the mathematicians get themselves in a loop, because I think

48:22.320 --> 48:29.640
the universe, I mean, I think say Max Tegmark is very playful and say like the universe

48:29.640 --> 48:30.640
is just math.

48:30.640 --> 48:34.080
If the universe is just math, then we might as well not bother having any conversation

48:34.080 --> 48:35.080
because the conversation already written.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.560
We just might as well go to the future and say, can you just give us the conversations

48:37.560 --> 48:38.820
happened already?

48:38.820 --> 48:43.840
So I think the problem is that mathematicians are so successful at labeling stuff and so

48:43.840 --> 48:48.600
successful understanding stuff through those labels, they forget that actually those labels

48:49.600 --> 48:53.000
and that information had to be built on those memories.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.840
So memory in the universe, so constraints, graph, when they become actionable and the

48:57.840 --> 49:03.100
graph can loop back on itself or interact with other graphs and they can intersect,

49:03.100 --> 49:06.040
those memories become actionable and therefore their information.

49:06.040 --> 49:11.640
And I think you just changed my mind on something pretty big, but I don't have a pen, so I'm

49:11.640 --> 49:17.040
going to write it down later, but roughly the idea is like you've got these two graphs

49:17.160 --> 49:23.020
of objects, of stuff, they have memories and then when they intersect and then they can

49:23.020 --> 49:28.160
act on each other, that's maybe the mechanism by which information is then, so then you

49:28.160 --> 49:29.360
can then abstract.

49:29.360 --> 49:33.320
So when one graph can then build another graph and say, hey, you don't have to go through

49:33.320 --> 49:36.340
the nonsense we had to go through, here's literally the way to do it.

49:36.340 --> 49:40.120
Stuff always comes first, but then when stuff builds the abstraction, the abstractions can

49:40.120 --> 49:42.200
be then teleported onto other stuff.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.600
Abstractions is the looping back to power.

49:44.600 --> 49:45.600
Okay.

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
Am I making, I don't know, I got stuck.

49:47.760 --> 49:56.600
Yeah, so first a God made stuff, then after that, when you start to be able to form abstractions,

49:56.600 --> 49:57.600
that's when...

49:57.600 --> 50:00.720
God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.440
God is the memory the universe can remember.

50:03.440 --> 50:04.440
Otherwise there's no...

50:04.440 --> 50:07.760
Someone's going to be deciphering that statement hundreds of years from now, what the hell

50:07.760 --> 50:08.760
does that mean?

50:08.760 --> 50:09.760
What does the humans mean by this?

50:09.760 --> 50:12.760
Hey, look, don't diss my one-liners.

50:12.920 --> 50:16.640
It took me 15 seconds to come up with that.

50:16.640 --> 50:19.640
I don't know what it means, what does it mean?

50:19.640 --> 50:24.520
Okay, wait, we need to, how do we get onto this?

50:24.520 --> 50:30.680
We were time causality mathematics.

50:30.680 --> 50:41.920
So what is mathematics in this picture of stuff, objects, memory, and information?

50:42.600 --> 50:45.040
What exactly is mathematics?

50:45.040 --> 50:49.920
It's the most efficient labeling scheme that you can apply to lots of different graphs.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.480
Labeling scheme doesn't make it sound useful.

50:52.480 --> 50:53.480
Can I try?

50:53.480 --> 50:54.480
Yeah, sure, please.

50:54.480 --> 50:56.760
Have you rejected my definition of mathematics?

50:56.760 --> 50:57.760
I'm shocked.

50:57.760 --> 50:58.760
Yeah, no, that's alright.

50:58.760 --> 50:59.760
But it's correct.

50:59.760 --> 51:02.760
Go on, sorry.

51:02.760 --> 51:03.760
Excellent.

51:03.760 --> 51:09.040
No, I mean, I think we have a problem, right, because we can't not be us, like we're stuck

51:09.040 --> 51:11.520
in the shells we are and we're trying to observe the world.

51:11.520 --> 51:15.240
And so mathematics looks like it has certain properties, and I guess the thought experiment

51:15.240 --> 51:20.400
I find is useful is to try to imagine if you were outside of us looking at us as physical

51:20.400 --> 51:26.000
systems using mathematics, what would be the specific features you associate to the property

51:26.000 --> 51:33.400
of understanding mathematics and being able to implement it in the universe, right?

51:33.400 --> 51:37.360
And when you do that, mathematics seems to have some really interesting properties relative

51:37.360 --> 51:43.200
to other kinds of abstraction we might talk about, like language or artistic expression.

51:43.200 --> 51:47.200
One of those properties is the one I mentioned already that is really easy to copy between

51:47.200 --> 51:48.200
physical media.

51:48.200 --> 51:51.960
So if I give you a mathematical statement, you almost immediately know what I mean.

51:51.960 --> 51:54.920
If I tell you the sky is blue, you might say, is it gold ball blue?

51:54.920 --> 51:55.920
Is it zero blue?

51:55.920 --> 51:56.920
What color blue do you mean?

51:56.920 --> 52:00.360
And you have a harder time visualizing what I actually mean.

52:00.360 --> 52:03.480
So mathematics carries a lot of meaning with it when it's copied between physical systems.

52:03.480 --> 52:07.040
It's also the reason we use it to communicate with computers.

52:07.040 --> 52:12.080
And then the second one is it retains its property of actually what it can do in the

52:12.080 --> 52:13.920
universe when it's copied.

52:13.920 --> 52:19.640
So the example I like to give there is think about like Newton's law of gravitation.

52:19.640 --> 52:25.600
It's a compressed regularity of a bunch of phenomena that we observe in the universe,

52:25.600 --> 52:29.800
but then that information actually is a causal in a sense that it allows us to do things

52:29.800 --> 52:33.040
we wouldn't be able to do without that particular knowledge and that particular abstraction.

52:33.040 --> 52:36.520
And in this case, like launch satellites to space or send people to Mars or whatever it

52:36.520 --> 52:39.320
is.

52:39.320 --> 52:42.840
So if you look at us from the outside and you say, what is it for physical systems to

52:42.840 --> 52:51.840
invent a thing called mathematics and then to use and then it to become a physical observable,

52:51.840 --> 52:58.080
mathematics is kind of like the universally copyable information that allows new possibility

52:58.080 --> 53:02.120
spaces to be open in the future because it allows this kind of ability to map one physical

53:02.120 --> 53:05.760
system to another and actually understand the general principles.

53:05.760 --> 53:11.240
So is it helping the overlap of causal graphs then by mapping?

53:11.240 --> 53:15.960
Oh, I think that's the explanation for what it is in terms of the physical theory of assembly

53:15.960 --> 53:20.920
would be some feature of the structure of the assembly spaces of causal graphs and their

53:20.920 --> 53:22.200
relationship to each other.

53:22.200 --> 53:26.320
So for example, and I mean, this is things that we're going to have to work out over

53:26.320 --> 53:27.320
the next few years.

53:27.320 --> 53:33.920
I mean, we're in totally uncharted conceptual territory here, but as is usual diving off

53:33.920 --> 53:34.920
the deep end.

53:35.480 --> 53:39.760
But I would expect that we would be able to come up with a theory of like, why is it that

53:39.760 --> 53:43.160
some physical systems can communicate with each other?

53:43.160 --> 53:47.560
Like language, language is basically because we're objects extended over time and some

53:47.560 --> 53:51.160
of the history of that assembly space actually overlaps.

53:51.160 --> 53:54.200
And when we communicate, it's because we actually have shared structure in our causal

53:54.200 --> 53:55.200
history.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.520
Let me have another quick go at this, right?

53:56.520 --> 53:57.520
So I think we all agree.

53:57.520 --> 54:03.160
So I think we take mathematics for granted because we've gone through this chain, right?

54:03.160 --> 54:06.160
You know, we all share a language now.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.640
OK, and we can well, we share.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.360
So we have languages that we can we can make interoperable.

54:11.360 --> 54:17.440
And and so whether you're speaking, I don't know, all the different dialects of Chinese,

54:17.440 --> 54:22.720
all the different dialects of English, French, German, whatever, you can interconvert them.

54:22.720 --> 54:26.200
The interesting thing about mathematics now is that everybody on planet Earth, every human

54:26.200 --> 54:32.480
being and computers share that common language, that language was constructed by a process

54:32.480 --> 54:33.480
in time.

54:33.480 --> 54:38.440
So what I'm trying to say is assembly invented math is those those pro right from the mathematics

54:38.440 --> 54:39.440
didn't occur.

54:39.440 --> 54:44.240
It didn't exist before life abstraction was invented by life, right?

54:44.240 --> 54:47.120
That doesn't mean that the universe wasn't capable of mathematical things.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
Wait, wait a minute.

54:48.120 --> 54:52.920
Can we just ask that that old famous question is math invented or discovered?

54:52.920 --> 55:00.400
So when you say assembly invented or whatever, you mean assembly is a mathematical theory,

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
but sorry.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.400
Right.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
Exactly.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.320
Are we arguing now?

55:05.320 --> 55:06.320
That's what it sounds like.

55:06.320 --> 55:07.320
Are we discovering?

55:07.320 --> 55:08.320
No.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.320
Well, yes and no.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.880
I would say you call mathematics a language.

55:11.880 --> 55:18.000
I would say that I'm pretty sure that there there are some very common seeds of mathematics

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
in the universe.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Right.

55:20.000 --> 55:25.640
But actually, not the mathematics we are finding now is not discovered.

55:25.640 --> 55:27.640
It's invented.

55:27.640 --> 55:30.480
But even though I think those two terms are very triggering, and I don't think they're

55:30.520 --> 55:35.800
necessarily useful because I think that what people do, the mathematicians that say, oh,

55:35.800 --> 55:40.720
mathematics was discovered because they live in a universe where there is no time and it

55:40.720 --> 55:41.720
just all exists.

55:41.720 --> 55:46.760
But what I'm saying is, and I think in the same way you can create, let's say I'm going

55:46.760 --> 55:51.520
to go and create and make a piece of art.

55:51.520 --> 55:57.560
Did I make that piece of art or did I discover discover it like inventing the airplane?

55:57.560 --> 55:58.560
Did I invent the airplane?

55:58.560 --> 55:59.560
Let's stick with the airplane.

55:59.640 --> 56:00.640
The airplane is a good one.

56:00.640 --> 56:01.640
Let's say I am.

56:01.640 --> 56:02.640
Did I discover the airplane?

56:02.640 --> 56:05.640
Well, in a way, the universe discovered the airplane because it's just chucked a load

56:05.640 --> 56:09.480
of atoms together and a load of random human beings wanting to do stuff and then we we

56:09.480 --> 56:12.280
discover the airplane in the space of possibilities.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.560
But here's the thing.

56:13.560 --> 56:21.600
When the space of possibilities is so vast, infinite, almost, and you're able to actualize

56:21.600 --> 56:24.720
one of those in an object, then you are inventing it.

56:24.720 --> 56:28.720
So in mathematics, because there are infinite number of theorems, the fact you're actually

56:28.880 --> 56:33.960
pulling, there's no difference between inventing a mathematical structure and inventing the

56:33.960 --> 56:34.960
airplane.

56:34.960 --> 56:35.960
They're the same thing.

56:35.960 --> 56:38.520
But that doesn't mean that now the airplane exists in the universe.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.280
It's something weird about the universe.

56:41.280 --> 56:50.380
So I think that the more memory required for the object, the more invented it is.

56:50.380 --> 56:56.640
So when a mathematical theorem needs more bytes to store it, the more invented it is

56:56.640 --> 57:00.120
and the less bytes, the more discovered it is.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.120
But everything then is invented.

57:02.120 --> 57:04.040
It's just more or less invented.

57:04.040 --> 57:05.040
Absolutely.

57:05.040 --> 57:09.720
The universe has to generate everything as it goes.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.120
And it wasn't there in the beginning.

57:11.120 --> 57:14.880
And the way we're thinking it when you're thinking about the difference between invented

57:14.880 --> 57:18.560
and discovered is because we're throwing away all the memory.

57:18.560 --> 57:24.000
So if you start to think in terms of causality and time, then those things become the same.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.080
Everything is invented.

57:26.080 --> 57:28.280
And the idea is to make everything intrinsic to the universe.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.960
So I think one of the features of assembly theory is we don't want to have external

57:31.960 --> 57:32.960
observers.

57:32.960 --> 57:35.220
There's been this long tradition in physics of trying to describe the universe from the

57:35.220 --> 57:37.920
outside and not the inside.

57:37.920 --> 57:41.480
And the universe has to generate everything itself if you do it from the inside.

57:41.480 --> 57:44.960
Assembly theory describes how the universe builds itself.

57:44.960 --> 57:49.920
Did it take you 15 seconds to say that and to come up with that also?

57:49.920 --> 57:50.920
No, I've thought about it before.

57:50.920 --> 57:51.920
Okay.

57:51.920 --> 57:52.920
That's a good line.

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
Are you making fun of me?

57:53.920 --> 57:54.920
No, I'm not making fun.

57:54.920 --> 57:55.920
I'm happy.

57:56.760 --> 57:57.760
I'm having fun.

57:57.760 --> 57:58.760
There's a difference.

57:58.760 --> 57:59.760
Oh, that's good.

57:59.760 --> 58:00.760
All right.

58:00.760 --> 58:01.760
She's inventing.

58:01.760 --> 58:02.840
I'm not all intimidated.

58:02.840 --> 58:06.360
And there's a causal history to that fun.

58:06.360 --> 58:12.080
You mentioned that there's no way to communicate with aliens until there's overlap in the causal

58:12.080 --> 58:14.960
graph.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.200
Communication includes being able to see them.

58:19.200 --> 58:36.600
What do aliens look like as you get more and more overlap on the causal graph?

58:36.600 --> 58:41.440
When you see them and they see you, you're assuming they have vision, they have the ability

58:41.440 --> 58:45.920
to construct in 3D, and in time, there's a lot of assumptions they're making.

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
What detection?

58:46.920 --> 58:47.920
All right, let's step back.

58:48.640 --> 58:49.760
You're right.

58:49.760 --> 58:53.340
In the English language, when we say the word see, we mean visually.

58:53.340 --> 58:56.480
They show up to a party and it's like, oh, wow, that's an alien.

58:56.480 --> 58:57.480
That's visual.

58:57.480 --> 58:58.480
That's 3D.

58:58.480 --> 58:59.480
That's okay.

58:59.480 --> 59:06.000
And that's also assuming spatial scale of something that's visible to you, so it can't

59:06.000 --> 59:12.200
be microscopic or it can't be so big that you don't even realize that's an entity.

59:12.200 --> 59:14.120
But all the kinds of detection too.

59:14.120 --> 59:15.640
I would make it more abstract and go down.

59:15.640 --> 59:21.040
I was thinking this morning about how to rewrite the Arecibo message in assembly theory

59:21.040 --> 59:25.520
and also to abandon binary, because I don't think aliens necessarily, why should they

59:25.520 --> 59:26.520
have binary?

59:26.520 --> 59:32.520
Well, they have some basic elements with which to do information exchange.

59:32.520 --> 59:37.280
Let's make it more fundamental, more universal.

59:37.280 --> 59:40.800
So we need to think about what is the universal way of making a memory, and then we should

59:40.800 --> 59:43.640
re-encode Arecibo in that way.

59:43.640 --> 59:45.800
That's more basic than zeros and ones.

59:45.800 --> 59:48.960
Well, it's really difficult to get out of that causal chain.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.840
So let's erase the idea of zero for a moment.

59:51.840 --> 59:55.040
It took human beings a long time to come up with the idea of zero.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.040
Now you've got the idea of zero.

59:56.040 --> 59:57.040
You can't throw it away.

59:57.040 --> 59:58.040
It's so useful.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.160
To discover the idea of zero.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:00.160
To discover or invent.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.160
I don't know.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.600
But it took a long time, so it was invented.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.600
That's right.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600
Yeah.

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.600
I think zero was invented.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.600
Exactly.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.480
So it's not a given that aliens know what zero is.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.240
They just have to warn.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.680
Massive assumption.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.200
It's a useful discovery.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:19.720
You're saying if you break the causal chain, there might be some other more efficient way

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.720
of representing.

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.280
That's why I want to meet him and ask him.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.280
For a shortcut.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.800
But you won't be able to ask him until...

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.920
So I interrupted you, and I think you're making a good point.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.920
I was just going to say, well, look.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920
Thank you.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.920
Sorry.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:34.920
Rather than saying...

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.520
Please, Internet, tweet at him for the rude interruptions.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520
Go ahead.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520
I'm sorry.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.520
No, it's okay.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.520
Maybe it's change.

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.960
So I don't know what it's like to be an alien.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.560
I would like to know.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:53.320
What is the full spectrum of what aliens might look like to us?

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.880
Now that we've laid this all on the table of like, all right, so there has to be some

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.920
overlap in this causal chain that led to them.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.240
What are we looking for?

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.000
What do you think we should be looking for?

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.960
So you mentioned mass spec, measuring certain objects that aliens could create or are aliens

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960
themselves.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:19.080
We show up to a planet or maybe not a planet or maybe...

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.160
What the hell is the basic object we're trying to measure the assembly index of?

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.160
Let's cut ourselves a break.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:32.040
Let's assume that they're metabolized, they've got an energy source and they're a size that

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.040
we can recognize.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.800
Let's give ourselves a break because there could be aliens that are so big, we won't

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.000
recognize with seeing them.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.800
There might be aliens that are so small, we don't yet have the ability to...

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.840
We don't have microscopes that can see far enough away that it just won't be able to

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840
see them.

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840
So what's a good range?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.960
So let's just make a range.

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.800
Let's just be very anthropocentric and say we're going to look for aliens roughly our

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.240
size and technology our size because we know it's possible on Earth, right?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.560
I mean, a reasonable thing to do would be to find exoplanets that in the same zone as

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:06.480
in terms of heat and stuff and then say, hey, if there's that same kind of gravity, same

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:13.400
kind of stuff, we could reasonably assume that the alien life there might use a similar

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.840
kind of physical infrastructure and then we're good.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.600
So then your question becomes really relevant.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.880
Say, right, let's use vision, sound, touch.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.980
So okay, that's really nice.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:32.420
If there's a lot of aliens out there, there's a good likelihood if you match to the planet

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:38.260
that they're going to be in the same spatial and temporal, operating in the same spatial

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.500
and temporal domain as humans.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:48.100
Okay, within that, what do they look like visually?

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.300
What do they sound like?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.300
What do they...

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.300
Oh God, this sounds creepy.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:53.300
Taste like?

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.380
What is it?

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.420
Oh, smell like, smell like this.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.460
It sounds like our clubhouse was like, can we have sex with aliens?

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.020
Which was basically me saying, but it wasn't actually about sex, it was about, is our chemistry

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020
compatible, right?

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020
Is there some...

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.020
Yeah.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.020
Yeah.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.020
Can we...

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.020
Yeah.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:11.020
Are they edible too?

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:12.020
They could be very edible.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.020
They could be delicious.

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.860
That's why I want to see some aliens, right?

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:21.740
Because I think evolution exploits symmetry, right?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.420
Why generate memory?

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:28.620
Why generate storage, the need for storage space when you can use symmetry?

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.100
And symmetry is maybe quite effective in allowing you to mechanically design stuff, right?

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:39.900
So maybe you could be reasonable to assume that aliens could have, they could be bipedal,

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:45.220
they could be symmetric in the same way, might have a couple of eyes or a couple of senses.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.220
We can make that.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:49.820
And perhaps there's this whole zoo of different aliens out there and we'll never get to be

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:53.660
able to classify some of the weird aliens we can't interact with because they have made

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.020
it such weird stuff.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.020
Yeah.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.220
But we are just going to look at, we're going to find aliens that look most like us.

01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.220
Why not?

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.540
Because those are the first ones we're likely to see.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.540
Yeah.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.540
Yeah.

01:04:04.540 --> 01:04:08.500
But I think it's really hard to imagine what the space of aliens is because the space is

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:13.180
huge because one of the arguments that you can make about why life emerges in chemistry

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:19.620
is because chemistry is the first scale in terms of building up objects from elementary

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.380
objects that the number of possible things that could exist is larger than the universe

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.900
can possibly make all at once, right?

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:32.100
So imagine you have two planets and they're cooking some geochemistry.

01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:37.180
Our planet invented one kind of biochemistry and presumably as you start building up the

01:04:37.180 --> 01:04:41.780
complexity of the molecules, the chances of the overlap in those trajectories, those causal

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.380
chains being built up is probably very low.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:49.220
And it gets lower and lower as it gets further advanced along its evolutionary path.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:53.300
So I think it's very difficult to imagine predicting the technologies that aliens are

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.300
going to have.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:59.740
I mean, it's so, you're looking at basically planets have kind of convergent chemistry,

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:00.940
but there's some variability.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.140
And then you're looking basically at the outgrowth into the possibility space for chemistry.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.140
Yeah.

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:10.060
So do you think we would detect the technology, the objects created by aliens before we detect

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:11.060
the aliens?

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.060
Possibly.

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:17.700
So when you're talking about measuring assembly index, don't you think we would detect the

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:19.140
garbage first?

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:26.140
Like at the outskirts of alien civilizations, isn't this going to be trash?

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.100
I think I would come back to Arecibo.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:33.620
The Arecibo message sent from the Arecibo telescope built by Drake, I think, and Sagan.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:34.620
How is Arecibo spelled?

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:35.620
A-R-E-C-I-B-O.

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.620
Yes.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:37.620
And there we go.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:42.660
That's the telescope that sent the message that you're talking about.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.620
So that message was sent where?

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:52.860
It was beamed at a star, a specific star, and it was sent out many years ago.

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.940
What they did, so this is why I was pushing on binary, it's a binary message.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:04.140
I think it's a semi-prime length number of characters, so I think 27E3 by 23, I think.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:10.940
And it basically represents proton, binary, human beings, DNA, male and female.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:12.780
And it's really cool.

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:20.700
But I'm just wondering if it could be done not making any, because it's made assumptions

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.300
that aliens speak binary.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.340
Why make that assumption?

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:28.620
Why not just assume that if the difference between physics, chemistry, and biology is

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:36.340
the amount of memory that's recordable by the substrates, then surely the universal

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:41.380
thing, I'm going to make some sacrilegious statement, which I think is pretty awesome

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:42.540
for people to argue with.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:49.940
We're looking at an image where it's the entirety of the message encoded in binary.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.260
And then there's probably interpretation of different parts of that image.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.980
There's a person, there's green parts.

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.740
It looks like for people just listening like a game of Tetris.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:06.140
So it's encoding in minimal ways a bunch of cool information, probably.

01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.140
Representing all of us.

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.740
So at the top it's kind of teaching us how to count, and then it all goes all the way

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:14.100
down teaching you chemistry and then just says, but it makes so many assumptions.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:19.140
And I think if we can actually, so look, I think, I mean, Sarah's much more eloquent

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.980
expressing this, but I'll have a go and you can correct it if you want.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:27.980
Which is like, one of the things that Sarah has had a profound effect on the way I look

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.580
at the origin of life.

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:33.300
And this is one of the reasons why we're working together, because we don't really care about

01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.300
the origin of life.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.780
We want to make life, make aliens and find aliens, make aliens, find aliens.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.340
So I think we might have to make aliens in the lab before we find aliens in the universe,

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.340
right?

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:45.540
I think that would be a cool way to do it.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:48.340
So what is it about the universe that creates aliens?

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.180
Well, it's selection through assembly theory, creating memories, because when you create

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:58.420
memories, you can then command your domain, you can basically do stuff.

01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:00.920
You can command matter.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.580
So we need to find a way by understanding what life is of how the minimal way to command

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.300
matter, how that would emerge in the universe.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:13.700
And if we want to communicate, I mean, maybe we don't want to necessarily uniformly communicate.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:18.260
What I would do, perhaps, if I had is I would send out lots of probes away from Earth that

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.340
have this magic way of communicating with aliens, get them quite a far away from Earth,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:27.140
plausibly deniable, and then send out the message that would then attract all the aliens

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.540
and then basically work out if they were friend or foe and how they want to hang out.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:33.500
The messages being something has to do with the memories.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:39.660
Like the assembly version of Arecibo, so that everyone in the universe understands what

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:41.060
life is.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.420
So aliens need to work out what they are.

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.420
Once they've worked out what they are, they then can work out how to encode what they

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.700
are, and then they can go out and send messages.

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:55.980
It's like the universal, the Rosetta Stone for life in the universe is working out how

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:56.980
the memories are built.

01:08:56.980 --> 01:09:02.660
I don't know, Sarah, you have any, well, whether you would agree with that?

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:09.260
No, I wanted to raise a different point, which is about the fact that we can't see the aliens

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.940
yet because we haven't gotten the technology.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.660
And presumably, we think assembly theory is the right way of doing it, but I don't think

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:20.060
that we know how to go from the kind of data you're describing, Lex, like visual data

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:23.380
or smell, to construct the assembly spaces yet.

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:28.420
And in some ways, I think that the problem of life detection really is the same problem

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:34.580
at the foundations of AI, that we don't understand how to get machines to see causal

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.020
graphs, to see reality in terms of causation.

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:44.060
And so I think assembly and AI are going to intersect in interesting ways, hopefully.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.860
But the sort of key point, and I've been trying to make this argument more recently, I might

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:55.140
write an essay on it, is people talk about the great filter, which is, again, this doomsday

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.420
thing that people want to say, there's no aliens out there because something terrible

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.500
happened to them.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.860
And it matters whether that's in our past or our future as to the longevity of our species,

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:08.260
presumably, which is why people find it interesting.

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.860
But I think it's not a physical filter.

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.940
It's not like things go extinct.

01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.780
I think it's literally we don't have the technology to see them.

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:16.780
And you can see that with microscopes.

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:20.580
I mean, we didn't know there were microbes on this table for, or tables for thousands

01:10:20.580 --> 01:10:21.580
of years, or telescopes.

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.580
Like, there's so much of the universe we can't see.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:28.040
And then basically what we have done as a species is outsource our physical perceptions

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.660
to technology, building microscopes based on our eyes, and building size monitors based

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.300
on our sense of feelings, like feel earthquakes and things.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.580
And AI is basically we're trying to outsource what's actually happening in our thinking

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.380
apparatus into machines now, into technological devices.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:47.340
And maybe that's the key technology that's going to allow us to see things like us and

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.820
see the universe in a totally different way.

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.140
But you kind of mentioned the great filter.

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:54.140
So do you think there's a way through technology to stop being able to see stuff?

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.740
So can you take a step backwards?

01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.740
I think so, yeah.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.540
Did you imply that with the great, so like...

01:10:58.540 --> 01:11:04.840
Well, no, I mean, I think there's a great perceptual filter in the sense that a example

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:09.260
of life evolving on a planet over billions of years has to acquire a certain amount of

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:14.420
knowledge and technology to actually recognize the phenomena that it is.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:20.980
Well, that's the sense I have is, I mean, you talk with physicists, engineers in general,

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:28.100
there's this kind of idea that we have most of the tools already to hear the signal.

01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:32.620
But to me, it feels like we don't have any of the tools to see the signal.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.260
Yeah, I agree.

01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.900
That's the biggest, like to hear.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.260
We don't have the tools to really hear, to see.

01:11:38.260 --> 01:11:39.260
Yeah.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:40.260
Aliens are everywhere.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.260
We just don't have the...

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.260
Exactly.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.900
Yeah, well, that's...

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.060
I mean, I got this in part, actually, because you were like, you know, last time I was here,

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.780
he was like, look at the carpet, you know, if you had an alien detector, would the carpet

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780
be aliens?

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:54.500
I mean, I think we really don't.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:59.620
It would be, but aliens would nevertheless have a high assembly index or produce things

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.620
of high assembly index.

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:07.100
And those things of a high assembly index, you have to have a detector that can recognize

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:09.100
high assembly index in all its forms.

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.100
Yeah.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.100
Yes.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:12.100
That's it.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:13.940
Construct assembly space.

01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:14.940
Yeah.

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:15.940
Those patterns, basically.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:21.540
So one way to think about high assembly index is interesting patterns of basic ingredients.

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:25.700
I can give you an example, because I mean, in molecules we've been talking about in objects,

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.140
but we're also trying to do it in spatial trajectories.

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.140
Like imagine you're just...

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:35.620
Like I always get bothered by the fact that like when you look at birds flocking, you

01:12:35.620 --> 01:12:38.860
can describe that with like a simple Boyd's model or like, you know, people use spin glass

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860
to describe animal behavior.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:45.700
And those are like really simple physics models, yet you're looking at a system that you know

01:12:45.700 --> 01:12:48.940
has agency and there's intelligence in those birds.

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:53.820
And basically, like you can't help but think there must be some statistical signatures

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:59.380
of the fact that that's a group of agents versus, you know, like, I don't know, the

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:03.820
physics example, maybe like, I don't know, Brownian motion or something.

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.940
And so what we're trying to do is actually apply assembly to trajectory data to try to

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:12.420
say there's a minimal amount of causal history to build up certain trajectories for observed

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.100
agents as like an agency detector for behavior.

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:21.700
Do you think it's possible to do some like Boyd's or those kinds of things like artificial

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:28.260
like cellular automata play with those ideas with assembly theory?

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:36.740
Have you found any useful, really simple mathematical like simulation tools that allow you to play

01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.020
with these concepts?

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:44.260
So like one, of course, you're doing mass spec in this physical space with with chemistry,

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.660
but it just seems like a computer science person.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:53.300
Maybe it seems easier to just agree with you and sexier in terms of tweeting visual information

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.540
on Twitter or Instagram.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:14:02.100
More importantly, to play like here's an organism of a low assembly index and here's an organism

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.820
of a high assembly index.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:09.460
And let's watch them create more and more memories and more and more complex objects.

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:14.300
And so like a mathematical you get to observe what that looks like to build up an intuition

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.860
what assembly index is like.

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:17.940
We are building a toolkit right now.

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.780
So I think it's a really good idea.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:24.300
But what we've got to do is I'm kind of still obsessed with the infrastructure required.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:29.500
And one of the reasons why I was pushing on information and mathematics when human beings

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.500
we take a lot of the infrastructure for granted.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.980
And I think we have to strip that back a bit for going forward.

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:36.980
But you're absolutely right.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:43.260
I would agree that I think the fact that we exist in the universe is like I can see that

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.140
lots of people disagree with the statement.

01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.180
But I don't think I don't think Sarah will.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.500
But I don't know.

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.460
The fact that objects exist.

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:55.980
I don't think anyone on Earth will disagree that objects can exist elsewhere, right.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:58.580
But they will disagree that life can exist elsewhere.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:04.740
But what perhaps I'm trying to say is that the acquisition, the universe's ability to

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:10.580
acquire memory is the very first step for building life.

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:14.220
And that must be that's so easy to happen.

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:20.540
So therefore alien life is everywhere because all alien life is is those memories being

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.940
compressed and minimized and the alien equivalent of the cell working.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:29.780
I think that we will build new technologies to find aliens.

01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:34.500
But we we need to understand what we are first and how we go from physics, the chemistry

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.620
to biology.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:41.620
The most interesting thing, as you say, to these two organisms, different assemblies

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.980
is when you get into biology, biology gets more and more weird, more and more contingent.

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.460
Physics is chemistry is less weird because the rules of chemistry are small and the rules

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:57.420
of biology and then going away to physics where you have a very nicely tangible number

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.220
of ways of arranging things.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.860
And I think assembly theory just helps you appreciate that.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.260
And so once we get there, my dream is that we are just going to be able to suddenly are.

01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:10.580
I mean, I mean, I'm maybe just being really arrogant here.

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.580
I don't mean to be arrogant.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.380
It's just, again, there's got this hammer called assembly and everything's a nail.

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:20.100
But I think that once we crack it, we'll be able to use assembly theory plus telescopes

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.500
to find aliens.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:27.740
Do you have, Sarah, do you have disagreements with Lee on the number of aliens that are

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.740
out there?

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.780
So and do actually.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780
And what they look like.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:36.740
So any of the things we've been talking about, is there nuanced?

01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:43.060
It's always nice to discover wisdom through nuanced disagreement.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:48.880
Yeah, I don't I don't wholly disagree, but I think but I do think I disagree.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:55.760
It's kind of there's nuance there, but it is nuanced, right?

01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:01.320
So you made the point earlier that you think, you know, once we discover what alien what

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.600
life is, we'll see alien life everywhere.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.640
And I think I agree on some levels in the sense that I think the physics that governs

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.280
us is universal.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.080
But I don't know how far I would go to say to say that we're likely phenomena, because

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.520
we don't understand all of the features of the transition at the origin of life, which

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:25.560
we would say in assembly as you go from the no memory physics to there's like a critical

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:28.760
transition around the assembly index where assembliness starts to increase.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.120
And that's what we call the evolution of the biosphere and complexification of the

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.120
biosphere.

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.880
So there's a principle of increasing assembliness, or that goes back to what I was saying at

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.280
the very beginning about the physics of the possible, that the universe basically gets

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.080
in this mode of trying to make as much possibilities as possible.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:50.720
Now, how often that transition happens that you get the kind of cascading effect that

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720
we get in our biosphere?

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:55.640
I think we don't know if we did, we would know the likelihood of life in the universe.

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.320
And a lot of people want to say life is common, but I don't think that we can say that yet

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.480
till we have the empirical data, which I think you would agree with.

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.600
But then there's this other kind of thought experiment I have, which I don't like, but

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:12.280
I did have it, which is, you know, if life emerges on one planet and you get this real

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:17.000
high density of things that can exist on that planet, is it sort of dominating the density

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.400
of creation that the universe can actually generate?

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.560
So like if you're thinking about counting entropy, right, like the universe has a certain

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.960
amount of stuff in it.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:29.200
And then, you know, assembly is kind of like an entropic principle, it's not entropy.

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:35.400
But the idea is that now transformations among stuff or the actual physical histories of

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.080
things now become things that you have to count as far as saying that these things exist

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.080
and we're increasing the number of things that exist.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:47.680
And and if you think about that cosmologically, maybe Earth is sucking up all the life potential

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.920
of the whole universe. I don't know.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.560
But I was that can you explain that a little bit?

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:57.160
Why can anyone geographical region suck up the greater capacity of the universe?

01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:00.240
Just like I know it's a ridiculous thought.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.400
I don't I don't actually agree with it, but it was just a thought experiment.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:07.600
I love that you can have thoughts that you don't like and don't agree with, but you have

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.960
to think through them anyway.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.960
Yeah. The human mind is fascinating.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:16.560
Yeah, I think these sort of like counterfactual thought experiments are really good when

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.600
you're trying to build new theories because you have to think through all the consequences.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:24.800
And there are people that want to try to account for, say, the degrees of freedom on our

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.680
planet in cosmological inventories of, you know, talking about the entropy of the universe

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.200
and, you know, and when we're thinking about like cosmological era of time and things like

01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.240
that. Now, I think those are pretty superficial proposals as they stand now.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.000
But assembly would give you a way of counting it.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:43.120
And then the question is if there's a certain maximal capacity of the universe's speed of

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:47.600
generating stuff, which Lee always has this argument that assembly is about time, the

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.600
universe is generating more states, really what it's generating is more assembly

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.880
possibilities. And then dark energy might be one manifestation of that, that the universe is

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.920
accelerating its expansion because that makes more physical space.

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.080
And what's happening on our planet is it's accelerating in the expansion of possible

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.000
things that exist. And maybe the universe just has a maximal rate of what it can do to

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.320
generate things. And then if there is a maximal rate, maybe only a certain number of planets

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.800
can actually do that. Or there's a trade off about the pace of growth on certain planets

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.120
versus others. I have a million questions there.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.280
What do you have? Do you have thoughts on just a quick?

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:22.960
Yeah, I'll just say something very quick. It's a thought experiment.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:27.920
No, it's good. I think I get it. I think I get it. So what I want to say is when I mean

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:36.880
aliens are everywhere, I mean memories are the prerequisite for aliens via selection,

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.800
and then the concentration of selection when selection becomes autonomous. So what I would

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:47.920
love to do is to build, say, a magical telescope that was a memory, magical one, a real one,

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:53.520
that would be a memory detector to see selection. So you could get to exoplanets and say that

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.440
exoplanet looks like there's lots of selection going on there. Maybe there's evolution and

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.640
maybe there's going to be life. So what I'm trying to say is narrow down the regions of

01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:05.920
space. We can say there's definitely evidence of memory as high assembly there, or not high

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.400
assembly because that would be life, but where it's capable of happening. And then that would

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.120
also help us frame the search for aliens. I don't know how likely it is to make the transition to

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:22.960
cells and all the other things. I think you're right. But I think that we just need to get more

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.320
data. Well, I didn't like the thought

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.320
experiment because I don't like the idea that if the universe has a maximal limit on the amount

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.160
it can generate per unit time, that our existence is actually precluding the existence of other

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.520
things. But I think that's probably true anyway because of the resource limitations.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.400
So I don't like your thought experiment because I think it's wrong. Well, no, no. I do like the

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.000
thought experiment. So what you're trying to say is like there is a chain of events that goes back

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:49.760
that's manifestly co-mated with life on Earth. And you're not saying that life isn't possible

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.520
elsewhere. You say that there has been these number of contingent things that have happened

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:58.160
that have allowed life to merge here. That doesn't mean that life can't emerge elsewhere,

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:02.720
but you're saying that the intersection of events may be concentrated here, right?

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:12.800
Not exactly. It's more like if you look at, say the causal graphs are fundamental, maybe space is

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:17.040
an emergent property, which is consistent with some proposals in quantum gravity, but also how

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:22.720
we talk about things in assembly theory, then the universe is causal graphs generating more

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.960
structure in causal graphs, right? So this is how the universe is unfolding. And maybe there's a

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:33.680
cap on the rate of generation, like there's only so much stuff that gets made per update of the

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:38.720
universe. And then if there's a lot of stuff being made in a particular region that happens to look

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:44.320
the same locally, spatially, that's an after effect of the fact that the whole causal graph

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:51.600
is updating. Yeah, I don't know that. I think that that doesn't work. I don't think it works

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.280
either, but I don't have a good argument in my mind about. But I do like the idea of the capacity

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.400
because you've got the number of states. Yeah, we can come back to it.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:06.720
Let me ask real quick. Why does different local pockets of the universe start remembering stuff?

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:16.240
How does memory emerge exactly? So at the origin of the universe, it was very forgetful. That's when

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:23.760
the physicists were happiest. There's low memory objects, which is like ultra low memory objects,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:32.560
which is what the definition of stuff. Okay. And so how does memory emerge? How does the temporal

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:42.480
stickiness of objects emerge? I'm going to take a very chemocentric point of view because I can't

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.920
imagine any other way of doing it. You could think of other ways maybe, but I would say

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:56.160
heterogeneity in matter is where the memory. So you must have enough different ways of rearranging

01:23:56.160 --> 01:24:00.880
matter for there to be a memory. So what that means is if you've got particles colliding in a box,

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:09.840
let's just take some elements in a box. Those elements can combine in a combinatorial set of

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:15.200
ways. So there's a combinatorial explosion of the number of molecules or minerals or solid objects,

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:21.280
bonds being made. Because there's such a large number, the population of different objects that

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.000
are possible. This goes back to assembly theory where assembly theory, there's four types of

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.960
universes. So you've got basically, and this was up earlier, where one universe where you've just

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.280
got everything is possible. So you can take all the atoms and combine them and make everything.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.160
Then you've got basically what is the assembly combinatorial, where you basically have to accrue

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:50.400
information in steps. Then you've got assembly observed, and then you've got the object assembly

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:55.840
going back. So what I'm trying to say is if you can take atoms and make bonds, let's say you

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:00.480
take a nitrogen atom and add it to a carbon atom, you find an amino acid, then you add another carbon

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.480
atom on it in a particular configuration, then another one, all different molecules, they all

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:12.640
represent different histories. So I would say for me right now, the most simple route into life seems

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:18.000
to be through recording memories and chemistry. But that doesn't mean there can't be other ways

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.600
and can't be other emergent effects. But I think if you can make bonds and lots of different bonds,

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:30.800
and those molecules can have a causal effect on the future. So imagine a box of atoms,

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.760
and then you combine those atoms in some way. So you make molecule

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:44.400
A from a load of atoms, and then molecule A can go back to the box and influence the box.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:52.160
Then you make A prime or AB or ABC, and that process keeps going. And that's where the

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.600
memories come from is that heterogeneity in the universe from bonding. I don't know if it makes

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:06.320
any sense. And it's beginning to flourish at the chemistry level. So the physicists have no,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:18.400
like not enough. They're like desperately begging for more freedom and heterogeneous

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.880
components to play with. Yeah, that's exactly it.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.760
What do you think about that, Sarah? I mentioned already,

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:30.160
I think it's significant that whatever physics governs life emerges actually in chemistry. It's

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:37.120
not relevant at the subatomic scale or even at the atomic scale. It's in, well, atomic scale

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:43.040
chemistry. But when you get into this combinatorial diversity that you get from combining things on

01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.880
the periodic table, that's when selection actually matters or the fact that some things can exist

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:55.760
and others can't exist actually starts to matter. So I think of it like you don't study gravity

01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:59.920
inside the atomic nucleus. You study it in terms of large scale structure of the universe or black

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.640
holes or things like that. And whatever we're talking about as physics of information or physics

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:10.720
of assembly becomes relevant at a certain scale of reality. And the transition that you're talking

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:16.720
about, I would think of is just when you get a sufficient density in terms of the assembly space

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:22.320
of like the relationship of the overlap and the assembly space, which is like a feature of common

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:30.880
memory, there is this transition to assembly dominated physics, whatever that is. And we're

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.600
trying to map out exactly what that transition looks like. We're pretty sure of some of its

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:39.040
features, but we haven't done all of that. Do you think if you were there in the early

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:43.040
university, you would have been able to predict the emergence of chemistry and biology?

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:48.480
And I asked that because at this stage as humans, do you think we can possibly predict

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:56.800
the length of memory that might be able to be formed later on in this pocket of the universe?

01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:02.160
Like how complex is, what is the ceiling of assembly?

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.640
I think as much time as you have in the past is how much you can predict in the future

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.880
because it's actually physical in the system. And you have to have enough time for

01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.800
features of that structure to exist.

01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.240
Wait, let me push back on that. Isn't there somewhere in the universe that's like a

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.000
shortest path that stretches all the way to the beginning that's building some giant monster?

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.640
Maybe, yeah. The universe has as much memory as the largest assembly object in the universe.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.480
Right. So you can't predict?

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.360
You can't predict any deeper than that, no.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:43.520
Right. So I guess what I'm saying is like what intuition do you have about complexity

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:50.080
living in the world that you'd have today, right? Because you can, I mean, I guess how long

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.880
does it get more fun? Like isn't there going to be at some point, because there's a heat

01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:03.040
death in the universe, isn't there going to be a point of the most, of the highest assembly

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.880
of object with the highest probability being generated all the time?

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.080
When is the universe going to be the most fun and can we freeze ourselves and then live then?

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:15.680
Exactly. And will you know when you're having the most fun that this is the best time you're

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.760
in your prime? Are you going to do what everyone does, which is deny that you're in your prime

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:23.040
and the best years are still ahead of you? I don't know.

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:31.200
What option do you have? I mean, the problem is there's lots of really interesting features here.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.520
I just want to mention one thing that might be, is I do think assembly theory applies all the

01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:40.720
way back to subatomic particles. And I also think that cosmological selection might have been

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.480
actually, there might have been, I would say it's a really boring bit, but it's really important

01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:49.280
for cosmologists that the universes have gone through. Was it Lee Smolin who proposed this,

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.600
maybe? That there is this, the basic universe evolves, you've got the wrong constants,

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:57.760
we'll start again. And the most productive constants where you can allow particles to

01:29:57.760 --> 01:30:01.920
form in a certain way, propagate to the next universe and we go again. So actually selection

01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:06.480
goes all the way back and there's this cycle of universes. And now this universe has been selected

01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:13.200
because life can occur and it carries on. But I've really butchered that. There is a much more-

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:18.880
So there's some aspect where through the selection process, there's parameters that are being fine

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:23.520
tuned and we happen to be living in one where there's some level of fine tuning. Is there,

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:31.200
given that, can you still man the case that we humans are alone in the universe?

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.880
We are the highest assembly index object in the universe.

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.240
Yeah, I can, I guess. Sad though. I mean, so from-

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.200
Is it possible?

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:47.920
Yes, it's possible. Let's assume, well, we know, I mean, it's possible. So let me,

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:53.360
so okay, so there is a particular set of elements on earth in a particular ratio

01:30:54.800 --> 01:31:00.800
and the right gravitational constant and the right viscosity, you know, of stuff being out of move

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:08.000
around, the right distance from our sun, right number of events where we have a moon, the earth

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:16.240
is rotating, the late heavy bombardment produced a lot of, brought in the right stuff. And

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:23.840
Mars was cooking up the right molecules first. So it was habitable before earth. It was actually

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:31.680
doing the combinatorial search and before Mars kind of became unhabitable, it seeded earth with

01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:37.600
the right molecular replicators and there was just the right stuff on earth and that's how the

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:44.560
miracle of life occurred. Although I find I'm very uncomfortable with that because actually,

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:54.320
because life came so quickly in the earth's past, but that doesn't mean that life is easy

01:31:54.320 --> 01:32:00.000
elsewhere. It just might mean that because chemistry is actually not a long-term thing,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.560
chemistry can happen quickly. So maybe going on with a steel manning of the argument to say,

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.880
actually, the fact that life emerged quickly doesn't mean that life is easy. It just means

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:15.040
that the chemistry was right on earth and earth is very special and that's why there's no life

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:22.240
anywhere else in the universe. Yeah. So Sarah mentioned this kind of cascading thing. So what

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:30.640
if that's the reason we're lucky is that we got to have a rare cascading of, like an accelerating

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.720
cascading effect in terms of the complexity of things. So like maybe most of the universe is

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:42.240
trying to get sticky with the memory and it's not able to really form it and then we got really

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:49.120
lucky in that. There's a lot of earth-like conditions, let's say, but you really,

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.400
really have to get lucky on this. But I'm doing experiments right now. In fact,

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:58.160
experiments that Sarah and I are working on because we have some joint funding for this,

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:02.000
where we're seeing that the universe can get sticky really quickly. Now, of course,

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.040
we're being very anthropocentric, we're using laboratory tools, we're using theory, but actually,

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:14.720
the phenomena of selection, the process of developing heterogeneity, we can do in the

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:21.040
lab. We're just seeing the very first hints of it and wouldn't it be great if we can start to pin

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:28.320
down a bit more precisely, becoming good Bayesianists for this, for the origin of

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:32.880
life and the emergence of life, to finding out what kind of chemistries we really need to look

01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:37.760
for. And I'm becoming increasingly confident we'll be able to do that in the next few years.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:44.000
Make life in the lab or make some selection in the lab from inorganic stuff, from sand, from rocks,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.080
from dead stuff, from moon. Wouldn't it be great to get stuff from the moon, put it in our origin of

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:56.320
life experiment and make moon life and restrict ourselves to interesting self-replicating stuff

01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.680
that we find on the moon. Sarah, what do you think about this approach of engineering life

01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:08.720
in order to understand life? So building life in the machine. Yeah, so Lee and I are trying right

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:17.520
now to build a vision for a large institute or experimental program basically to do this problem,

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.880
but I think of it as like we need to simulate a planet. So like the large hajun collider was

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.440
supposed to be simulating conditions just after the big bang. Lee's built a lot of technology in

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:33.280
his lab to do these kind of selection engines, but the question you're asking is how many

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:38.000
experiments do you need to run? What volume of chemical space do you need to explore before you

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.040
actually see an event? And I like to make an analogy to one of my favorite particle physics

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.880
experiments, which is super Kamiakande that's looking for the decay of the proton. So this is

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.840
something that we predicted theoretically, but we've never observed in our universe. And basically

01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:56.240
what they're doing is every time they don't see a proton decay event, they have a longer bound on

01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.680
the lifetime of proton. So imagine we built an experiment with the idea in mind of trying to

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.240
simulate planetary conditions, physically simulate. You can't simulate origin life in a computer. You

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:11.600
have to do it in an experiment. Simulate enough planetary conditions to explore the space of

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.920
what's possible and bound the probability for an origin life event. Even if you're not observing

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:23.600
it, you can talk about the probability, but we, hopefully life is not exponentially rare and we

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:32.400
would then be able to evolve in an automated system, alien life in the lab. And if we can do

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.360
that, then we understand the physics as well as we understand what we can do in particle accelerators.

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:44.480
So keep expanding physically the simulation, the physical simulation until something happens.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:48.480
Yeah, or just build a big enough volume of chemical experiments and evolve them.

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.720
If you say volume, you mean like literally volume.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.720
I mean, physical volume in terms of space, but I actually mean volume in terms of the

01:35:54.720 --> 01:36:01.520
combinatorial space of chemistry. How do you nicely control the combinatorial exploration,

01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:07.920
the search space, such that it's always like, you keep grabbing the low hanging fruit.

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.400
Yeah. How do you build a search engine for chemistry?

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.520
I think you explained it really well. We should carry on doing this. I should pretend the physics

01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:18.640
be the physicist, you be the chemist. No, so the way to do it is, I will always play a joke

01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:28.080
because I like writing grants to ask for money to do cool stuff. Years ago, I started wanting to

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:32.720
build. So I actually wanted the weather. So I built this robot in my lab called a computer,

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:38.640
which is this robot you can program to do chemistry. Now I made a programming language

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:45.920
for the computer and made it operate chemical equipment. Originally, I wrote grants to say,

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.600
hey, I want to make an origin of life system. And no one would give me any money for this.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:56.000
They said, this is ridiculous. Why are you wanting to make it? It's really hard. It takes forever.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.440
You're not a very good origin of life chemist anyway. Why would we give you any money?

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:05.440
And so I turned it around and said, can you instead, can you give me money to make robots,

01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.880
to make molecules that are interesting? And everyone went, yeah, okay, you can do that.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:17.760
So actually, the funny thing is the computer project, which I have in my lab, which is very

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:21.840
briefly, it's just basically, it's like literally an automated test tube. And we've made a programming

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:29.440
language for the test tube, which is cool. It literally came from this. I went to my lab one

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:33.440
day, I said, I want to make a search engine to get the origin of life because I don't have a planet.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:39.440
And I thought about doing it in a microfluidic format. So microfluidic is very small channels

01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.760
in device where you can basically have all the pipes produced by lithography.

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.800
And you can have a chamber, maybe say, between say 10 and 100 microns in volume. And we slot

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:54.000
them all together like Lego, and we can make an origin of life system. And I could never get it

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.760
to work. And I realized I had to do chemistry at the kind of test tube level. And what you want

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:08.320
to be able to do, yeah, it goes back to that tweet, 1981. 1981, the computer, we're looking

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:15.200
at a tweet from Lee. In 1981, the computer was a distant dream. Oh, wow, this is the scientist

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:23.120
looking back at his, the young boy who dreamed. In 2018, it was realized, spelled in a British

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:30.320
way, realized. Yeah, I'm starting to feel sad. So now there's a system that does the physical

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:36.960
manifestation or whatever the programming language, the spec tells you to do.

01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:39.840
Yeah. Well, in 1981, I got my first computer, ZX81.

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.480
What was the computer? ZX81.

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.080
ZX81.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:53.200
Sinclair ZX81. And I got a chemistry set. And I like the chemistry set. And I like the computer.

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:56.400
And I just wanted to put them together. I thought, wouldn't it be cool if I could just use

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:01.120
the computer to control the chemistry set? And obviously that was insane. And I was like,

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:10.800
eight years old, right? Nine years old, going on nine years old. And then I invented the

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.400
chem-puter just because I wanted to build this origin of life grid, right? Which is like,

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.240
literally a billion test tubes connected together in real time and real space,

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:25.440
basically throwing a chemical dice. Throw dice, throw dice, throw dice. You're going to get lucky.

01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:31.760
And that's what we, I think Sarah and I have been thinking very deeply about because, you know,

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:38.240
there's more money being spent on the origin of the gravity or looking at the Higgs boson than

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:43.600
the origin of life, right? And the origin of life is the, I think, the biggest question,

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.560
or not the biggest question. It is a big question. Let's put it that way.

01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:48.800
It is the biggest question. You're okay saying that.

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.000
Isn't it possible once you figure out the origin of life that that's not going to solve,

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:59.360
um, that's not actually going to solve the question of what is life?

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:04.480
Like, isn't it? Cause you're putting a lot of, yeah, I think they're the same problem,

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:11.120
but you're putting, is it possible that you're putting too many, um, too much bets into this

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:16.320
origin part. Maybe the origin thing isn't, isn't there always a turtle underneath the turtle?

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.120
Isn't it a stack of turtles? Cause then if you create it in the lab, maybe you need some other

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.960
stuff. Well, let's not think about the origin. Like in the lab, there's still memory.

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.600
Yeah. Yes. Right. The experiment is already the product of evolution.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:36.960
Right. In some maybe really deep way, not an obvious way, in some very deep way. So maybe,

01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.320
uh, the haters are always going to be like, well, you have to reconstruct the fold. They have to

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.440
build it. Fortunately for us, the haters are not aware of that argument. Well, no, I know,

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:54.320
we're the one making that argument usually. I just think that if we create life in the lab,

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:59.600
it's not obvious that you'll get to the deep, deep understanding of necessarily, um,

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:04.880
what is the line between life and non-life? No, I think so. Look, there's so much here.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:09.200
I'm just like a playing devil. So much here, but let me play devil's advocate back in a previous

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:15.840
conversation, right? And say, um, uh, yeah, I will. Why not? Why not? We've got time. Let's go.

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.840
Cellular automata. Yes. Cellular automata. These, these very, very, um, simple things

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.880
where you color squares, um, black or white and implement rules and play them in time. And you

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.600
can get these very, very complex patterns coming out. You know, there's nice rules.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:38.400
They're cheering complete rules. And, um, and, um, I would argue that cellular automata are that,

01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:44.320
uh, don't really exist on their own. They have to exist on a, in a computing device.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:48.000
If that, well, there's computing devices, a piece of paper and abstraction, a mathematician

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:56.960
drawing a grid or, um, a, a, a framework. Now, so I would argue CA's are beautiful things,

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.000
simple, going complex, but the complexity is all borrowed from the lithography, the numbers.

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.880
Right. Now let's take that same argument with the, um, the chemistry experiment origin of life.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.520
Kat, what you need to be able to do is go out and I'm inspired to do this, to go out and look for

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:21.760
CA's occur in nature. You know, let's kind of, let's find some, um, some CA's that just emerge

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:27.120
in our universe. And, uh, for people just to interrupt for people, um, just listening and in

01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:33.680
general, I think what we're looking at, um, is a cellular automata where again, as Lee described,

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:39.200
there is just binary black or white squares and they only have local information and they,

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:44.160
they're born and they die. And you would think nothing interesting would emerge, but actually

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.400
what we're looking at is something that I believe is called glider guns, uh, or, or a glider gun,

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:57.840
which is, um, moving objects in this multi-cell space that look like their organisms that have

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:04.080
much more information that have much more complexity than the individual building components.

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:10.560
In fact, look like they have a long-term memory. Uh, well, while the individual components don't

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.680
seem like they have any memory at all, which is fascinating.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:18.320
Yeah. So the argument here is, um, that has to exist on all this layer of infrastructure,

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:22.080
right? And though it looks simple. And then what I would make, the argument I would make if I were

01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:28.720
you say, well, I think CA's are really simple and everywhere is safe. Show me how they emerge in a

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.920
substrate. Now let's go to the origin of life where machine, I don't think we want to do the

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:39.600
origin of life. Just any origin is good. So we do. So we literally have our sand shaker, shake the

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:46.080
sand like massive grid of chemistry experiments, shaking sand, shaking, whatever. And then because

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.680
we know what we've put in, so we know where, how we've cheated in the same way with CA, we know how

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.720
we've cheated. We know what the micro, we know the number of operations needed. We know how big a

01:43:52.720 --> 01:44:01.040
grid we want to get this. If we could then say, okay, how can we, um, generate this recipe in the

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:06.480
lab and make a life form? What were the, what contingency did we need to put in? And we're

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:12.960
upfront about how we cheated. Okay. Say, oh, you had to shake it. It was a periodic planet rotates.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:20.320
It's tried, comes in and out. So, and then we can start to basically say, okay, how difficult is it

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.480
for these features to be found? And then we can look for exoplanets and other features. So I think

01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:30.640
Sarah's absolutely right. We want to explain to people we're cheating. In fact, we have to cheat.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:34.160
No one has given, I'm good at writing grants where I used to be. I'm not very good right now. I keep

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.400
getting rejected, but I writing a grant for a planet and a hundred million years, no grant

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.840
fund there is going to give me that, but maybe money to make a kind of a grid, a computer grid,

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:50.560
origin of life, computer grid in physical space and just do it. So Sarah said something,

01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:57.360
which is you can't simulate the origin of life in a, in a computer. So like in simulation,

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:05.680
why not? What were your, you said it very confidently. So is it possible and why would

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:11.920
it be very difficult? Like what's your intuition there? I think it's very difficult right now

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.360
because we don't know the physics, but if you go based on principles of assembly theory and you

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.240
think every molecule is actually a very large causal graph, not just the molecule, then you

01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.080
have to simulate all the features of those causal graphs. And I think it becomes computationally

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.240
intractable. You might as well just build the experiment. Oh, because you have in the physical

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:33.520
space, you have all the objects with all the memories. Yes. And in the computer, you would

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:39.280
have to copy them and reconstruct. Yes. Yeah. That's a beautifully put. And I would say that

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:46.800
lots of people, you just don't have enough resources. It's easier to actually do the

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.520
physical experiment because we are literally, I would view the physical experiment almost

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:55.280
like a computational experiment. We're just outsourced. It's just basically, we're just

01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:00.400
outsourcing all the matrix algebra. And on your point about the experiment being

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.720
also an example of life, it's almost like you want to design, it's like, you know, all of us are

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.160
lineages of propagating information across time. And so everything we do becomes part of life

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.400
because it's part of that causal chain. So it's like, you want to try to pinch off as much as you

01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:21.120
can of the information from your causal chain that goes into the experiment, but you can't pinch off

01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:25.040
all of it to move it to like a different timeline. It's always going to be part of your timeline.

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:28.480
But at least if you can control how much information you put in, you can try to see

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:34.720
how much does that particular trajectory you set up start generating its own assembly. So you know

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:39.440
where it starts and then you want to try to see it take off on its own when you try to pinch it

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:48.240
off as much as possible. Got it. Quick pause, bath and break. Yes. All right, cool. And now we're

01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:54.720
back. All right. We talked about the early days of the universe when there was just stuff and no

01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:00.400
memory, not even causality. I think Lee at least implied that causality is emergent somehow.

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.960
We could discuss this. What happened before

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:08.640
this all originated? What's outside the universe?

01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:17.760
Divided by zero. Okay. So it's not relevant, not understandable. Is it useful to even ask the

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:24.000
question? No. Because it's so hard? No, it's not hard. Just not a question.

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.240
If I can't do an experiment or even think of an experiment, the question doesn't exist.

01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:32.800
Well, no, you can't think of a lot of experiments. No offense.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.720
What I mean is I can't- Because your causality graph is like,

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.880
this is what we've been talking about. It's like there is limits to your ability

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:49.120
to construct experiments. I agree. But I was trying to be facetious and I'm trying to make a point

01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:58.000
because I think that if there is a causal bottleneck through which information can't

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.560
propagate in principle, then it's very hard to think of an experiment, even in principle,

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:10.720
even one that's beyond my mediocre intellect, right? Which is fine. I'm happy to accept that.

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:14.640
But this is one of the things I actually do think there was something before the Big Bang

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.440
because I would say that I think the Big Bang just couldn't occur and create time.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.360
Time created the Big Bang. So there was time before the Big Bang.

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:25.280
Yeah. There was no space, but there was time.

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:30.880
Yeah. But I mean, I'm just making that stuff up just to make all the physicists happy.

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.680
Do you think that would make them happy? Because they would be quite upset, actually.

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.080
Why would they be upset? Because they would say that

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:43.360
time can't exist before the Big Bang. Yeah. I mean, this goes back to an argument

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:48.400
that you might not want to have the argument here. I was talking to Sarah earlier today

01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:55.840
about an argument we had about time a long time ago. I think there is this thing called

01:48:55.840 --> 01:49:00.240
time or state creation. The universe is creating states and it's outside of space,

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.800
but they create space. So what I mean is you can imagine there are states being created

01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.960
all the time and there is this thing called time. Time is a clock, which you can use to measure

01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:15.280
when things happen, but that doesn't mean because you can't measure something that

01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:23.840
states aren't being created. So you might locally refer to the Big Bang and the Big Bang occurred

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.880
at some point when those states were there. Probably there had to be enough states for

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:35.760
the Big Bang to occur. But I think that there is something wrong with our conception of how

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:41.680
the universe was created and the Big Bang because we don't really get time. Again,

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:48.160
I don't want to become boring and sound like a broken record, but time is a real thing.

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.080
Until I can really explain that more elegantly, I'm just going to get into more trouble.

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.280
We're going to talk about time because time is a useful measuring device for experiments,

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.720
but also time is an ideal. But let me first ask Sarah, what do you think?

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.440
Is it a useful question to ask what happened before the Big Bang? Is it a useful question

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:17.600
to ask what's outside the universe? I would think about it as the Big Bang

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:22.160
is an event that we reconstructed as probably happening in the past of our universe based on

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:30.800
current observational data. The way I like to think about it is we exist locally in something

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:37.680
called the universe. Going back to the physics of existence, we exist locally in the space of all

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:42.960
things that could exist. We can infer certain properties of the structure of where we exist

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:50.160
locally. One of the properties that we've inferred in the past is that there is a thing we call the

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.160
Big Bang. There's some signatures of our local environment that indicate that there was a very

01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:02.080
low information event that started our universe. I think that's actually just an artifact of

01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:09.840
the structure of the assembly space that when you start losing all the memory in the objects,

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:15.600
it looks like what we call a Big Bang. I think it makes sense to talk about where you are locally.

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.200
I think it makes sense to talk about counterfactual possibilities, what could exist outside the

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:26.000
universe in the sense that they become part of our reasoning and therefore part of our causal

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.720
chain of things that we can do. The multiverse in my mind exists, but it doesn't exist as a

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:37.200
multiverse of possible universes. It exists as an idea in our minds that allows us to reason about

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:40.800
how physics works and then to do physics differently because we reason about it that way.

01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:49.040
I always like to re-center it on things exist, but they don't always exist like we think they

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:54.160
exist. When we're thinking about things outside the universe, they absolutely exist because

01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:00.240
we're thinking about them. They don't look like the projections in our minds. They're something

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:09.120
else. Something you said just gave me an idea to go back to your question. If something caused the

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:13.280
Big Bang, if there was some memory or some artifact of that, then of course, to answer

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:17.280
your question, it's worth going back to that because that would imply there is something

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:20.720
beyond that barrier, that filter. That's what you were saying, I guess.

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:25.280
Right. I'm agnostic to what exists outside the universe. I just don't think that. I think the

01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.880
most interesting things for us to be doing are finding explanations that allow us to do more,

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.880
that optimism. I tend to draw the boundary on questions I ask as being scientific ones because

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:42.560
I find that that's where the most creative potential is to impact the future trajectory

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:45.920
of what we're doing on this planet. The interesting thing about the Big Bang is

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:51.920
basically from our current perspective of what we're able to detect, it's the time when things

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:59.360
were forgotten. Yes. It's the time the reset from our limited perspective. The question is,

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:07.360
is it useful to ever study the thing that was forgotten or should we focus just on the memories

01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.400
that are still there? Well, the point I was trying to make about the experiment is I was

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:15.280
trying to say both things. I think perhaps, yes, from the following point of view, if you could then

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:21.200
imagine what was forgotten and then work forwards, you will have different consequences. Then it

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:26.240
becomes testable. As long as we can find tests, then it's definitely worth thinking about.

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:30.080
What I don't like is when physicists say what happened before the Big Bang and before,

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:38.080
before, before, without giving me any credible conjecture about how would we know the difference.

01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:42.640
But the way you framed it is quite nice. I like that. It's like a, what have we forgotten?

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.240
Is there a room for God in assembly theory? Who's God?

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:52.000
I like arguments for a necessary being better than God.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.800
Well, I think I said it earlier. What's a necessary being?

01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.160
Something that has to exist.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:02.080
Oh, so you like, I mean, you like the shortest path. Does God need-

01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.240
No, no, no. I mean, well, you can go back to Thomas Aquinas and arguments for

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:12.560
the existence of God, but I think most of the interesting theological arguments are always

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:16.960
about whether something has to exist or there was a first thing that had to exist.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:19.760
But I think there's a lot of logical loopholes in those kind of arguments.

01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:28.400
Well, so God here, meaning the machine that creates, that generates the stuff.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.480
So what I was trying to say earlier- Isn't that just the universe?

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:38.640
Yeah. Well, yeah. Well, but I, there's a difference between, I imagine like a black box,

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:45.360
like a machine. Then I would be more comfortable calling that God because it's a machine. You go

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:49.040
into a room and there's a thing with a button. Yeah. I don't like the great programmer in the

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:56.400
sky version. Yeah. But if it's more kind of, like, I don't like to think of, if you look at a

01:54:56.400 --> 01:55:05.280
cellular automata, if it's the cells and the rules, that doesn't feel like God that generates a bunch

01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:13.600
of stuff. But if there's a machine like that does, that runs the cellular automata and set the rules,

01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:20.240
then that feels like God. That sort of, in terms of terminology. So I wonder if there's like a

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:25.600
machine that's required to generate this universe. That's very sort of important for running this in

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.640
the lab. So as I said earlier, I think I said this earlier that I can't remember the phrase,

01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:37.600
but something like, I mean, does God exist in our universe? Yes. Where does God exist? God at least

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:44.560
exists in abstraction in our minds, particularly of people who have religious faith they believe

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:48.400
in. But let's then take your, but you're talking a little bit more about generic, say, well,

01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:54.560
is there a mechanism beyond the universe you're calling God? I would say God did not exist at the

01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:02.000
beginning, but he or she does now. Cause I'm saying the- Well, you don't know that he didn't

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:09.360
exist in the beginning. So like, this could be us in our minds trying to just listen to

01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:13.600
gravitational waves, detecting gravitational waves. It's the same thing as us trying to

01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:20.400
go back further and further into our memories to try to understand the machines that make up

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:30.240
us. And so it's possible that we're trying to grasp at possible kind of, what kind of machines

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:37.600
could create. There's always a tweet. There's always a tweet. If the universe is a computer,

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:45.040
then God must have built it because computers need creators. There you go. And then Yoshabach

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:50.480
replied, since there's something rather than nothing, perhaps existence is the default.

01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:58.880
If existence is the default, then many computers exist. Creator gods are necessary computers,

01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:03.360
and necessarily computers too. I'm very confused by that, but that's an interesting idea that

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:07.600
existence is the default versus non-existence. I agree with that, but the rest is-

01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:14.640
Lee responds, perhaps this reasoning is incomplete. That's how scientists talk trash each other on

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:20.480
Twitter apparently. Which part don't you agree with? When he said if existence is the default,

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:24.800
then many computers exist. This comes back to the inventor and discovery argument.

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:32.640
I would say the universe at the beginning wasn't capable of computation because there wasn't enough

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:40.480
technology, enough states. What you're saying is if God is a mechanism- I might actually agree,

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.760
but then the thing is lots of people see God as more than a mechanism. For me, God could be

01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:50.000
the causal graph in assembly theory that creates all the stuff that the memories we know.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.680
And the fact that we can even relate to each other is because we have the same,

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:58.720
we share that heritage. And why we love each other or we like to see God in each other is

01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:07.120
it's just- we know we have a shared existence. So if the God is the mechanism that created this

01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:14.560
whole thing, I think a lot of people see God in the religious sense as that mechanism also

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:19.600
being able to communicate with the objects it creates. And if it's just the mechanism we

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:26.800
won't be able to communicate with the objects it creates, it can only create. It can't interact

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.200
with the- Well, there's versions of God that create the universe and then left.

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:37.280
Yeah, like spark. For some religions. The first spark, yeah.

01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:42.320
Yeah, but I think I liked your analogy of the machine and the rules, right? But

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:50.320
I think part of the problem is, I mean, we have this conception that we can disentangle the rules

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:53.760
from the physical substrate, right? And that's the whole thing about like software and hardware

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.680
being separate or the way Newton wrote his laws that there was some, you know, like they exist

01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.640
outside the universe. They're not actually a feature of the universe. They don't have to merge

01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:07.520
out of the universe itself. So I think if you merged your two views, then it gets back to the

01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:11.600
God as the universe. And then I think the deeper question is why does it seem like there's meaning

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:17.200
and purpose? And if I think about the features of the universe that give it the most meaning

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.360
and purpose, those are what we would call the living components of the universe. So if you

01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:26.080
wanted to say God is a physically real thing, which you were saying is like an emergent property of

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:31.280
our minds, but I would just say, you know, the way the universe creates meaning and purpose,

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:36.400
there is really a physics there. It's not like a illusory thing and that is just what the physics

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:44.080
of life is. Is it possible that we've forgotten much of the mechanisms that created the universe?

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:51.760
So like, so basically, you know, whatever God is that mechanism, we just leave parts of that

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:55.920
behind. Well, but the universe is constantly generating itself. So if God is that mechanism,

01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:00.080
it would be that that would still be active today. I don't believe I like I'm agnostic,

02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:07.520
but if I would call the things I believe in God in the way that some people talk about God,

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:13.360
I would say that God is, you know, like in the universe now. It's not an absent thing.

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:24.960
So I think there's a mislabeling here because you're, I mean, I'm a professional idiot,

02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:33.680
actually. But you should put that on your CV. Professionally, not recreationally or amateur,

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:39.280
but professionally. I would say if you were talking about God, I mean, again, I'm way out,

02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:44.240
way out of my depth here and I almost feel uncomfortable articulating, but I'll try.

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:49.920
For me, a lot of people that think of God as a consciousness, a reasoning entity that actually

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:57.200
has causal power and you're, and you're, and so you're like, then you're saying like gravity

02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:03.200
could be God or time could be God. I mean, I think for me, for my conception of time is probably as

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.240
fundamental as God because it gave rise to human intelligence and consciousness in which we can

02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:15.920
have this abstract notion of God. So I think that you're maybe talking about God in a very

02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:20.880
mechanistic kind of unsophisticated sense, whereas other people say that God is more

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:26.160
sophisticated and got all this, you know, feelings and love and, you know, and this abstracting

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:32.480
ability. So is that what, or do you mean that? Do you mean God as in this conscious entity that

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:39.360
decided to flick the universe into existence? Well, one of the features that God

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:49.040
would have is the ability to flick the universe into existence. I, you know, like Windows 95,

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:55.200
I don't know if God is Windows 95 or Windows XP or Windows 10. I don't know the full feature set.

02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:01.760
Okay. So the very least you have to flick the universe into existence and then other

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.920
features might include ability to interact with that universe in interesting ways. And then

02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:12.320
how do you interact with the universe in interesting ways? You have to be able to

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:18.000
speak the language of its different components. So in order to interact with humans, you have to

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:29.760
know how to act human-like. So I don't know, but it seems like

02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:38.160
like whatever mechanism created the universe might want to also generate

02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:45.840
local pockets of mechanisms that can interact with that. Like inject. God was lonely.

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:51.600
Yeah, it was lonely. I mean, it could be just a teenager and another just playing a video game.

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:57.440
Maybe what I was going to say, I mean, I, I don't, so this is referring to our origin of life engine.

02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.400
It's like, I don't believe in God, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be one.

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:02.000
Right.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.160
Well, I want to make a universe and make a life form, but that may be, that may be rude to people

02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:12.960
who have, you know, dear religious beliefs. What I mean by that is, isn't it, if we are able to

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:20.000
create an entirely new life form, different chemistry, different culture, what does it make

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.840
up and makes us good by that definition, it makes us gods, right? Well, there is, I mean,

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:28.640
like when you have children, you're like one of the magical things of that is you're kind of

02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:34.480
mini gods. I mean, first of all, from a child's perspective, parents are gods for quite a while.

02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:39.360
And then you, I mean, they're, they're in the positive sense is that there's a magic to that.

02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.240
That's why I love robotics is you instill life into something and that makes you

02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:50.160
feel God like in a sort of positive way.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.520
Being a creator is a positive thing.

02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:55.360
Creator. Yeah, exactly. And a small scale. And then goddess would be

02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:03.600
a creator at the largest possible scale, I suppose. Okay. You mentioned offline the Assembletron.

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.000
Assembletron.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.040
Assembletron.

02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:07.360
Yep.

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.160
What's an Assembletron? These are the, this is an early idea of something you're thinking about.

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:16.240
So Sarah's team, well, I think Sarah's team are interested in

02:04:16.720 --> 02:04:24.080
using AI to understand life and my team is, and I'm wondering if we could apply the principles

02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:30.640
of assembly theory, that is the causal structure that you get with assembly theory and hybridize

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:37.760
it and make a new type of neuron, if you like. I mean, there are causal neural networks out there,

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:43.040
but they are, they are not quite the architectural what I would like. I would like to associate

02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:50.240
memory bits with, basically I'd like to make a, rather than having an ASIC for neural networks,

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:57.600
I want to make an ASIC for assembly networks. Right. And so can you say that again? Assembly

02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:06.640
networks. So what is a sort of like a thing with an input and output and it's like a neural network

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:09.680
type of thing. What does it do exactly? What's the input? What's the output?

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:14.240
So in this case, so if you're talking about a general neural network, I mean, in general

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:20.160
neural network, you can train it on any sort of data, right? Depending on the framework,

02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:27.680
whether it's like text or image data or whatnot. And that's fine, but there's no

02:05:28.880 --> 02:05:33.760
causal structure associated with that data. Now, just imagine rather than, you know,

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:37.200
let's say when a classifier difference between cat and dog, right? Classic cat and dog neural

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:43.360
network. What about if the system understood the assembly space to create the cat and the dog?

02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:50.080
And rather than guessing what was happening and training on those images and not understanding

02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:57.760
those features, you almost like, you could imagine doing a, going back a step and doing

02:05:58.400 --> 02:06:02.400
and training, going back a step and doing the training, going back a step, back a step, back

02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:07.440
a step. And I wonder if that is actually the origin of intelligence or how we'll crack

02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:16.320
intelligence because we need to, because we'll create the entire graph of events and be able

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.320
to kind of look at cause and effect across those graphs. I'm explaining it really badly,

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:27.680
but it's a gene of an idea. And I'm guessing very smart, very rich people in AI are already doing

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:34.960
this. Trying to not generate cats and dogs, but trying to generate things of high assembly index.

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:41.680
Yeah. And I think, I think, and also using causal graphs in neural networks and machine learning

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:46.160
and deep learning, maybe building a new architecture. I'm just wondering, is there something we can get

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:53.280
out assembly theory allows us to rebuild current machine learning architectures to give more, give

02:06:53.280 --> 02:06:57.600
causation more cheaply? I mean, I don't know if that's what you're, we've been inventing this for

02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:01.440
a little while, but we're trying to finish the theory paper first before we do anything else.

02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:07.200
Yeah. You also want to have, say, goal-directed behavior in neural networks. Then assembly theory

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:10.880
is a good framework for doing that. Daniel's been thinking about that a lot. And I think it's a

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:16.960
really interesting idea that you can map concepts from how neural networks learn to thinking about

02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:21.760
goal-directed behavior as a learning process, that you're learning a specific goal, the universe is

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:25.520
learning a goal when it generates a particular structure and that you can map that physical

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:33.440
structure into a neural network. What's the goal? Well, in a neural network, you're designing the

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:40.800
goal in biology. I mean, you know, people are not supposed to use teleological language in biology,

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:47.520
which is ridiculous, but because goals are real things, they're just post-selected. So you can

02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:53.680
talk about goals after the fact. Once a goal emerges in the universe, that physical entity

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:59.520
has a goal. But Lee and I came up with a test for, like a Turing test for goal-directed behavior

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.760
based on the idea of assembly. We have to formalize this still, but I would like to

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:10.160
write a paper on it. But the basic idea is like, if you had two systems that were completely

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:16.640
equivalent in the instantaneous physical experimental setup, so Lee has to figure

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.000
out how to do this, but there was something that would be different in their future and there was

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.400
a symmetry breaking you observe in the present based on that possibility of that future outcome,

02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.800
then you could say that that system had some representation of some kind of goal in mind

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:37.440
about what it wanted to do in the future. So goals are interesting because they don't exist

02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:42.560
as instantaneous things, they exist across time, which is one of the reasons that assembly theories

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:50.880
may be more naturally able to account for the existence of goals. So goals are, they only exist

02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:59.520
in time, or they manifest themselves in time through, you said, symmetry breaking. So it's

02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:06.720
almost like, imagine, like if representations in your mind are real, right, and you can imagine

02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:11.840
future possibilities, but imagine everything else is physically equivalent, and the only thing that

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:17.440
you actually change your decision based on is what you model as being the future outcome, then

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.080
somehow that representation in your mind of the future outcome becomes causal to what you're doing

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.640
now. So it's kind of like retrocausal effect, but it's not actually retrocausal, it's just that your

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:32.640
assembly space is actually includes those possibilities as part of the structure. It's

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:35.360
just you're not observing all the features of the assembly space in the current moment.

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:42.000
Well, the possibilities exist, but they don't become a goal until they're realized.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:46.640
So one of the features of assembly space that's super interesting, and it's easier to envision

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:51.680
with like Legos, for example, is if you're thinking about an assembly space, you can't observe the

02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:56.160
entire assembly space in any instant in time. So if you imagine a stack of Legos, and you want to

02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:01.360
look at the assembly space of a stack of Legos, you have to break the Legos apart, and then you

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.800
look at all the possible ways of building up the original object. So now you have in your mind the

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:11.440
goal of building that object, and you have all the possible ways of doing it, and those are actual

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.240
physical features of that object, but that object doesn't always exist. What exists is the possibility

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:21.600
of generating it. And the possibilities are always infinite. Well, for that particular object,

02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:28.000
it has a well-defined assembly space, and I guess what I'm saying is that object is the assembly

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.120
space, but you actually have to unpack that object across time to view that feature of it.

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:40.720
It's only an observable across time. The term goal is such an important and difficult to explain

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:47.040
concept, because what you want is a way, it's like I think only conscious beings can have conscious

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:54.160
goals. Everything else is doing selection, but selection does invent goals, and in a way that

02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:59.440
the way that biology reinterprets the past in the present

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:04.960
is kind of helps you to understand there was a goal in the past now,

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.920
right? It's kind of like goals only exist back in time.

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:18.400
So first of all, only conscious beings can have conscious goals. I'm not even going to touch that

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:27.840
one. Why? Go for it. Come on. Well, the line between conscious goals and non-conscious goals,

02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:33.360
exactly. And also maybe just on top of that, you said a touring test for goal-directed behavior.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:40.400
What does a touring test potentially look like? So if you've got two objects, we were thinking

02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:45.520
about this. So we actually got some funding to work together on two teams. So I'm trying to do,

02:11:45.520 --> 02:11:49.520
and part of this is I'm trying to do a bit of theory, and Sarah's teaching me a bit of theory,

02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:52.640
and Sarah's trying to design experiments, and I'm teaching experiments, because I think it's

02:11:52.640 --> 02:12:01.120
really good for us to have that. So that's good. I like this, should we use the Dan Dennett essay?

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.720
Yeah, and I can explain why we wouldn't want to call it a touring test after.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:11.520
So Dan Dennett wrote this really nice essay about herding cats and free will inflation.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:14.560
The title is so brilliant. That's the actual title.

02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:17.920
That's the title, yeah. Herding cats and free will inflation.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:20.560
Yeah, something like that. I mean, it's not, maybe not. And so-

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:21.360
No, I think that's right.

02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.560
So if you've got a, let's imagine you've got two objects on a hillside,

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:30.240
okay, and this happens to be a snowy hill. And let's just say you see an object rolling down the

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:37.600
hill, and it rolls down the hill, but the start goes to the end. How do you know objects had a

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:42.560
goal? Now you unveil the object, and you'll see it's actually a skier. And the skier starts at

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:47.600
the top and goes down the bottom. Great. Then you look at the rock. Rock rolls down the hill,

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:53.120
goes to the bottom. How can you tell the difference between the two? So, and what Dan says is like,

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:58.640
well, it's clear the skier's in control, and because they're adjusting the trajectory,

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.160
so there's some updating going on. Then the only way you could really do that is you have to put

02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.000
the skier back to the top of the hill again. They tend to start roughly in the same space,

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:11.040
and probably go take all that complex set of trajectories and end up pretty much at the same

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:15.280
finish point, right, with plus or minus a few meters. Whereas if it was just a random rock

02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.760
going down to random trajectory, that wouldn't happen. And so what Sarah and I were kind of

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:25.440
doing when we were writing this grant, we were like, we need to somehow instantiate the skier

02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:32.880
and the rock in an experiment, and then say, okay, when does the object, so for an object to have a

02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.480
goal, it has to have an update, it has to have some sensing and some kind of in-built actuation

02:13:38.480 --> 02:13:45.120
to respond to the environment. And then we just have to iterate on that. And maybe, Sarah,

02:13:45.120 --> 02:13:49.120
you can then fill in the Turing test part. Well, yeah, I guess the motivation for me was

02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.040
slightly different. So I get really frustrated about conversations about consciousness as most

02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:59.280
people do. A lot of people are, which is not necessarily related to free will directly or

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:03.840
to this goal directed behavior. But I think there's a whole set of bundled and related topics

02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:09.280
here. But I think for me, I was, you know, everybody's always interested in explaining

02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:13.600
intrinsic experience and quantifying intrinsic experience. And there's all sorts of problems

02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.840
with that. Because you can never actually be another physical system. So you can't know what

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.920
it's like to be another physical system. So I always thought there must be some way of getting

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:28.720
at this problem about if an agent or an entity is conscious, or at least has internal representations,

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:36.720
and those are real physical things, that it must have causal consequences. So the way I would

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.680
ask the question of consciousness is not, you know, what is it like intrinsically? But if things

02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:47.040
have intrinsic experience, is there any observable difference from the outside about the kind of

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:52.160
causation that that physical system would enact in? And for me, the most interesting thing that

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.280
humans do is have imagination. So like we can imagine rockets centuries before we build them.

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.680
They've become real physical things because we imagine them. And people might disentangle

02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.600
that from conscious experience. But I think a lot of the sort of imagination we do is actually

02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:11.280
a conscious process. So then this becomes a question of if I were observing systems,

02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:16.800
and I said one had an internal representation, which is slightly different than a conscious

02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:20.960
experience, obviously, so I'm entangling some concepts, but it's a loose set of thought

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:29.440
experiments, and I set them up in a physically equivalent situation, would it be the case that

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:37.360
there would be experimental observables associated with it? And that became the idea of trying to

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.840
actually measure for internal representation of consciousness. So Turing basically didn't want

02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:45.920
to do that. He just wanted the machine that could emulate and trick you into having the behavior,

02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:51.360
but never dealt with the internal experience because he didn't know how to do that. And I

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:56.720
guess I was wondering, is there a way to set up the experiment where you could actually test for

02:15:56.720 --> 02:16:02.720
that? For imagination that led to the- That there was something internal going on,

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.840
some kind of inner world, as people say. Or you could say, it actually is an agent,

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:14.800
it's making decisions, it has an internal representation. And whether you say that's

02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:19.360
experience or not is a different thing, but at least the feature that there's some abstraction

02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:24.160
it's doing that's not obvious from looking at the physical substrate. Do you think it's possible

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:29.760
to do that kind of thing? One of the compelling things about the Turing test is that defining

02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:37.760
intelligence, defining any complicated concept as a thing, like observing it from the surface

02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:41.760
and not caring about what's going on deep inside, because how do you know?

02:16:42.480 --> 02:16:46.960
That's the point. The idea is exactly that. What we're trying to do, the Turing test for

02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:52.240
goal-directedness is literally take some objects that clearly don't have any internal representation,

02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.560
grains of sand blowing on the beach or something, and a crab wandering around on the beach,

02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:04.720
and then generating an experiment where the experiment generates an entity that literally

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:09.920
has no internal representation to sand. These are oil droplets, actually, what I've got in mind,

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:14.560
a robot that makes oil droplets. But then what we want to try and do is train the oil droplets to

02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:21.520
be like crabs, give them an internal representation, give them the ability to integrate information

02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:28.080
from the environment, so they understand, they remember the past, are in the present,

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:33.520
and can imagine a future. And in a very limited way, their kind of game engine,

02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:38.160
their limited simulation of the world allows them to then make a decision.

02:17:38.160 --> 02:17:39.280
They're objects across time.

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:44.480
So then you would run a bunch of crabs, like over and over and over and over?

02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:45.520
How many crabs, Lee?

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:52.560
Because you have to have a large number of crabs. What does your theory say? Is there a mathematical?

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:54.160
We're working on it. I mean, this is literally-

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.760
Limit, crab limit.

02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:57.040
There's literally a-

02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:57.520
Excellent.

02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:58.560
There's literally-

02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:01.840
What's the herding cats have to do? Oh, that's random. Wait, what's cats?

02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.720
In the title by Daniel Dennett, Herding Cats and the Free Will Inflation,

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:10.720
what does herding cats mean? What does free will inflation mean?

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:16.640
So this, I love this essay, because it explained to me how I could live in a deterministic universe,

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:28.640
but have, not free will, but have freedom, and also help me explain that time needed

02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:32.880
to be a real thing in this universe. So what basically Dan was saying here is like,

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:36.560
how do you, how do these cats appear to just do what they want?

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.560
Right? And if you live in a deterministic universe, why do the cats do these things?

02:18:43.360 --> 02:18:48.560
Aren't they just, isn't it all obvious? And how does free will inflate the universe?

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:53.680
And for me, I mean, probably I love the essay because my interpretation of the essay

02:18:53.680 --> 02:19:01.520
in assembly theory makes complete sense. Because you need an expanding universe in assembly theory

02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:09.360
to create novelty that you search for, that then when you find something interesting and you keep

02:19:09.360 --> 02:19:14.800
doing it because it's cool and it gives you an advantage, then it appears in the past to be a

02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:21.360
goal. So what does in assembly theory, the expansion of the universe look like? What are

02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:29.200
we talking about? Why does the expansion universe give you more possibilities of novelty and cool

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:34.000
stuff? So for me, I don't think about the universe in terms of big bang in space.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.320
I think about in terms of the big, the big memory expansion that you have one,

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:42.720
you only have the ability to store one bit of information. So then you can't do very much.

02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:47.920
So what the universe has been doing since the, since forever, it's been creating more,

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:55.440
it's been increasing the size of its ram. Okay. So it's like one megabyte, two megabyte, three

02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:02.320
megabyte, four megabytes all the way up. And so the more ram you have, the more you can remember

02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:08.160
about the past, which allows you to do cooler things in the future. So if you can remember how

02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:13.440
to launch a rocket, then you might be able to imagine how to land a rocket and then relaunch,

02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:21.920
re-land and carry on. And so you're able to expand the space and remember the past. And so that's why

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:27.440
I think it's very important. But not a perfect memory. It's an interesting question whether

02:20:27.440 --> 02:20:33.200
there's some forgetting that happens and might increase. Is the expansion of the forgetting

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:38.240
at some point accelerate faster than the remembering? I think that that's a very

02:20:38.240 --> 02:20:42.240
important thing that probably intelligence does. And we're going to learn in machine learning about

02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:46.080
because you want machine learning right now or artificial intelligence right now doesn't have

02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:51.600
memory right, but you want the ability to, or not for, if you want to get to human-like

02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:56.320
consciousness, you need to have the ability, I suppose, to remember stuff and then to selectively

02:20:56.320 --> 02:21:01.120
forget stuff so you can re-remember it and compress it. Arguably the way that we come up with new

02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:07.360
physical laws. Yeah, sorry, you were conforming. No, no, it's all right. No, I just wanted to-

02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:15.760
I think that there is a great deal to be gained from having the ability to remember things,

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:20.640
but then when you forget them, you can then have it, you can basically do the simulation again

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:25.200
and work out if you get to that compressed representation so that it's in cycles.

02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:31.520
So cycles of remembering and forgetting are probably important, but there shouldn't be

02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:36.960
excuse to have a universe with no memory in it. The universe is going to remember that it forgot,

02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:44.320
but just not tell you. I'm looking at this paper and it's talking about a puppet controlling a

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:48.080
puppet, controlling a puppet, controlling a puppet, controlling a puppet, controlling a puppet.

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:51.600
Conceptually easy to understand, but physically impossible. It's physically impossible. It's

02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:56.560
predicting a fair coin toss. I don't know what he's talking about, but there's pictures of puppets

02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:03.200
controlling puppets. Let me ask you, there's a few things I want to ask, but we brought up time

02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:10.960
quite a bit. You guys tweet about time quite a bit. What is time in all of this? We kind of

02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:17.520
mentioned it a bunch. Is it not important at all in terms of, is it just a word? Should we be talking

02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:25.120
about causality mostly? Sarah, what do you think? We've talked about memories. Is that the fundamental

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:29.600
thing that we should be thinking about? And time is just a useful measurement device or something

02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:33.600
like that? Well, there's different concepts of time, right? So I think in assembly theory,

02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:36.800
when we're talking about time, we're talking about the ordering of things. So that's the

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.280
causal graph part. And so then the fundamental structure of the universe is that there is a

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:45.280
certain ordering and certain things can't happen until other things happen. But usually when we

02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:52.320
colloquially talk about time, we're talking about the flow of time. And I guess Lee and I were

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:56.480
actually debating about this this morning. So in talking on it, walking on the river here,

02:22:56.480 --> 02:23:02.720
which is a very lovely spot for talking about time. But when the universe is updating, it's

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:06.720
transitioning between things that exist now and things that exist now.

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:15.600
That's really the flow of time. So you have to separate out those concepts at bare minimum.

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:20.560
And then there's also an arrow of time that people talk about in physics, which is that time doesn't

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:25.440
appear to have a directionality in fundamental physics, but it does to us, right? Like we can't

02:23:25.440 --> 02:23:30.640
go backwards in time. And usually that would be explained in physics in terms of, well,

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:33.840
there's a cosmological arrow of time, but there's also the thermodynamic arrow of time of

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:38.560
increasing entropy. But what we would say in assembly theory is that there is a clear

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:41.920
directionality. The universe only runs in one direction, which is why some things,

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:46.800
it's easy to make, if the universe runs in one direction, it's easy to make processes look

02:23:46.800 --> 02:23:50.880
reversible. For example, if they have no memory, they're easy to run forward and backwards,

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:55.200
which is why the laws of physics that we have now look the way they do, because they involve

02:23:55.200 --> 02:23:59.440
objects that have no memory. But when you get to things like us, it becomes very clear that the

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:05.520
universe has a directionality associated to it. So it's not reversible at all. No man ever steps

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:08.800
in the same river. I just have to bring that up because you walked down the river. No man

02:24:08.800 --> 02:24:13.360
ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.

02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:20.080
So it's not reversible. No, but reversibility is an emergent property, right? So we think of the

02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:24.240
reversibility of laws as being fundamental and the irreversibility as being emergent. But I think

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.720
what we would say from how we think about it, and it certainly seems to be the case for our

02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:35.200
perception of time, but also what's happening in biological evolution, you can make things reversible,

02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:40.400
but it requires work to do it. And it requires certain machines to run it forward and backward.

02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:44.400
And Chiara Marletto is working some interesting ideas on constructor theory related to that,

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.520
which is a totally different set of ideas. So you can travel back in time sometimes?

02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:57.040
Yes. You can't travel actually back in time, but you could reconstruct things that have existed in

02:24:57.040 --> 02:25:02.720
the past. You're always moving forward in time, but you can cycle through. Can I clarify what you

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:07.760
just said? Yeah, go for it. Quickly, you travel forward in time to travel back. Yes. Thank you,

02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:13.360
that really clarified it. What Sarah's saying is you don't go back in time, you recreate what

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:17.600
happened in the past in the future and inspect it again. So in that local pocket of time, it's as

02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:22.800
if you travel back in time. So how is that not traveling back in time? Because you're not going

02:25:22.800 --> 02:25:27.520
back to your same self back in time. You're creating that in the future. But everything else

02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.440
is the same as it was in the past. No, no, no, no. It's not in registry. I mean, it goes back to the

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:39.680
big question I'm saying, I mean, this is something I was trying to look up today when we first had

02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:44.880
this discussion and I was talking to Sarah on Skype and said, by the way, time is the fundamental

02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:49.440
thing in the universe. She almost hung up on me. Right, but you can even, I mean, if you want to

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:53.120
make an analogy to computation, and I think Charles Bennett actually has a paper on this like

02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:58.080
about reversible computation and reversible Turing machines. In order to make it reversible,

02:25:58.080 --> 02:26:03.440
you have to store memory to run the process backwards. So time is always running forward

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:08.000
in that because you have to write the memory. You can erase the memory. You can erase the memory,

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:14.240
but the point when you go back to zero, right? But the whole point is that in order to have a

02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:19.680
process that even runs in both directions, you have to start talking about memory to store

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:23.680
the information to run it backwards. I got it. So you can't really then,

02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:30.880
you can't have it exactly how it was in the past. You have extra stuff, extra baggage always.

02:26:30.880 --> 02:26:34.400
Okay. A really important thing that I want to say on this, I think if I try and get it right,

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:39.600
is to say that if you can think that the universe is expanding in terms of the number of

02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:47.440
boxes that it has to store states, right? And this is where the directionality of the universe comes

02:26:47.440 --> 02:26:51.920
from, everything comes from. You could erase what's in those boxes, but the fact you've now

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:56.960
got so many boxes at time now in this present, there's more of those boxes than there were in

02:26:56.960 --> 02:27:03.760
the past. See, but the boxes aren't physical boxes. It's not space or time. So why is the

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:08.880
number of boxes always expanding? It's very hard to imagine this because we live in space.

02:27:09.520 --> 02:27:16.480
So what I'm saying, which is, I think, probably correct, is that we just, let's just imagine for

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:22.480
a second, there is a non-local situation, but there are these things called states

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:30.320
and that the universe, irrespective of whether you measure anything, there is a universal,

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:37.280
let's call it a clock or a state creator. Maybe you can call it God, but let's call it a state

02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:42.480
creator where the universe is expanding in the number of states it has. Why are you saying it's

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:45.120
expanding though? Is that obvious that it's expanding in the number of states? It's obvious

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:53.040
because that's the source of novelty. It's the source of novelty and it also explains why the

02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:59.040
universe is not predictable. How do you know it's not predictable? I just like interrupting you.

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:01.280
So it's fun because you're struggling.

02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.920
I'm struggling because I'm trying to be as concrete as possible and not sound like I'm

02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:15.680
insane. And I'm not insane. It's obvious because I'm a chemist. So as a chemist, I grew

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:22.880
into the world understanding irreversibility. Irreversibility is all I knew. And when people

02:28:22.880 --> 02:28:27.760
start telling me the universe is actually reversible, it's a magic trick. We can use

02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:39.440
time to do it. So what I mean is the second law is really magical. But why does it need to be

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:44.000
magical? The universe is just asymmetric. All I'm saying is the universe is asymmetric in the state

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:50.800
production and we can erase those states, but we just have more computational power. So what I'm

02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:56.480
saying is that the universe's deterministic horizon, this is one of the reasons we can't

02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:00.960
live in a simulation, by the way. You can't live in a simulation.

02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.400
The irreversibility?

02:29:02.400 --> 02:29:05.280
Yeah. So basically every time you try and simulate the universe,

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:09.920
I live in a simulation, the universe is expanded in states. You're like, oh, damn it. I need to

02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:14.400
make my computer bigger again. And every time you try and contain the universe in the computation,

02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:20.800
because it's got bigger in number of states. And so I'm saying the fact the universe has novelty

02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:28.240
in it is going to turn out experimentally to be proof that time, as I've labeled it,

02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:33.840
is fundamental and exists as a physical thing that creates space.

02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:40.720
Okay. So if you can prove that novelty is always being created, you're saying that it's possible

02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:47.280
to also then prove that it's always expanding in the state space. Those are things that have

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.000
to be proven.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:49.840
That's what we're working on experiments for. Yeah.

02:29:49.840 --> 02:29:55.280
And you're trying to like, by looking at the sliver of reality, show that there's always

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:56.240
novelty being generated.

02:29:56.240 --> 02:30:01.600
Yeah. Because if we go live in a universe that conventional physicists would live in,

02:30:01.600 --> 02:30:09.600
it's a big lookup table of stuff and everything exists. I want to prove that that book doesn't

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:13.840
exist. It's continuously being added pages on. So what I'm saying, if the universe is a book,

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:19.760
the universe at the beginning only had no pages and have one page, another page, another page,

02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:24.560
whereas a physicist would now say all the pages exist and we could in principle access them.

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:27.040
I'm saying that is fundamentally incorrect.

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:30.160
Do you know what's written in this book? The free will question.

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:40.560
Is there room for free will in this view of the universe is generating novelty

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:46.000
and getting greater and greater assembly structures built? Sarah?

02:30:46.720 --> 02:30:47.220
Yes.

02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:48.420
Okay.

02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:50.340
Done. Next question.

02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:52.980
What's the source of free will in this?

02:30:52.980 --> 02:30:55.780
Well, I think it depends on what you mean by free will.

02:30:58.180 --> 02:30:59.220
Yeah. Well, please.

02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:05.460
I think what I'm interested in as far as the phenomena of free will is,

02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:14.260
do we have individual autonomy and agency? And when I do things, is it really me or is it my

02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:20.020
atoms that did it? And that's the part that's interesting to me. I guess there's also the

02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:27.220
determinism versus randomness part. But the way I think about it is each of us are like a thread

02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:35.220
or like an assembly space through this giant possibility space. And it's like we're moving

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:40.100
on our own trajectory through that space and that is defined by our history. So we're sort

02:31:40.100 --> 02:31:48.900
of causally contingent on our past, but also because of the intersection of novelty generation,

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:54.740
it's not completely predetermined by the past. And so then you have the causal control

02:31:55.700 --> 02:32:00.500
of the determinism part, that you are your causal history and there's some determinism

02:32:00.500 --> 02:32:05.220
from that past, but there's also room for creativity. And I think it's actually

02:32:05.940 --> 02:32:10.340
necessary that something like free will exists if the universe is going to be as creative as

02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:19.220
possible. Because if I were all intelligent being inventing a universe and I wanted it to have

02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:24.100
maximal number of interesting things happen, again, we should come up with the metric of

02:32:24.100 --> 02:32:32.180
interesting, but generating, yes, I know, generating maximal possibilities, then I would

02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:40.180
want the agents to have free will because it means that they're more individual. Each entity

02:32:40.180 --> 02:32:45.300
actually is a different causal force in the universe and it's intrinsic and local property

02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:51.940
of that system. There's a greater number of distributed agents? Are you always creating

02:32:51.940 --> 02:32:58.820
more and more individuality? Kind of. I would say you're creating more causal power, but-

02:32:58.900 --> 02:33:05.140
So causal power, the word consciousness, is the causal power somehow correlated with consciousness?

02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:08.980
I mean, that's why I have this conception of consciousness being related to imagination,

02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:13.380
because the more that we can imagine can happen and the more counterfactual possibilities

02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:17.540
you have in mind, the more you can actually implement. And somehow free will is also at

02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:23.380
the intersection of the counterfactual becoming the actual. So can you elaborate on that a little

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:28.180
bit, that consciousness is imagination? I don't know exactly how to articulate it. And I'm sure

02:33:28.180 --> 02:33:32.500
people will take aim at certain things I'm saying, but I think the language is really

02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:37.780
imprecise. So I'm not the best way to- It's really interesting. What is imagination and

02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:45.220
what role does it play in the human experience and experience of any agent?

02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:50.420
I love imagination. I think it's the most amazing thing we do. But I guess one way I would think

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:54.980
about it is we talked about the transition to life being the universe acquiring memory,

02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:59.140
and life does something really interesting. Just think about biology generally. It remembers

02:33:59.140 --> 02:34:04.180
states of the past to adapt to things that happen in the future. So the longer life has evolved on

02:34:04.180 --> 02:34:08.340
this planet, the deeper that past is, the more memory we have, the more kinds of organisms and

02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:13.540
things. But what human level intelligence has done is quite different. It's not just that we

02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:18.340
remember states that the universe has existed in before, it's that we can imagine ones that have

02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:24.340
never existed and we can actually make them come into existence. And I think that's the most unique

02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:30.180
feature about the transition to whatever we are from what life on this planet has been doing

02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:34.020
for the last four billion years. And I think it's deeply related to the phenomena we call

02:34:34.020 --> 02:34:38.180
consciousness. Yeah, I was going to just agree with that. I think that consciousness is the ability

02:34:38.180 --> 02:34:42.900
to generate those counterfactuals. Now, whether you can say, are there degrees of consciousness?

02:34:45.620 --> 02:34:51.140
I'm sorry, panpsychist, but electrons don't have counterfactuals, although they do have some kind

02:34:51.140 --> 02:34:57.380
of, they are able to search a space and pathways. But I think that there is a very concrete,

02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:05.220
there's a very specific property that humans have. And I don't know if it's unique to humans. I mean,

02:35:05.220 --> 02:35:11.540
maybe dogs can do it and birds can do it, right? And where they are basically solving a problem,

02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:16.820
because consciousness was invented or this abstraction was invented by evolution for a

02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:23.620
specific reason. And so, look, one of the reasons why I came to the conclusion that time was

02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:31.300
fundamental was actually because Sarah and I had completely different... The most heated debate on

02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:36.900
Skype chat ever. No, no, no, no, we had to... On which topic? No, it goes back to the free will

02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:41.860
thing. So I think that although I've changed my view a bit, because there's some really interesting

02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:48.260
physicists out there who talks about how the measurement problem in Newtonian space... I don't

02:35:48.260 --> 02:35:54.100
want to go there just now because I think I'll mess it up, but briefly, I could not see how

02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:59.380
we can have free will. I mean, this is really boring because this is a well trodden path,

02:35:59.380 --> 02:36:05.780
but I'm not so boring. I suppose we just want to be precise. If the universe is deterministic,

02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:14.740
how can we have free will, right? So Sarah's a physicist. I think she can show that most of

02:36:14.740 --> 02:36:20.100
the laws we have are deterministic to some degree, quantum mechanics onto Newtonian stuff.

02:36:20.100 --> 02:36:22.660
And yet there's Sarah telling me she believes in free will. I'm like,

02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:30.580
your belief system is broken here, right? Because you're demanding free will in a deterministic

02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:38.820
universe. And then I realized that I agreed with her that I do think that free will is a

02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:42.980
thing because we are able to search for novelty. And then that's where I came to the conclusion

02:36:42.980 --> 02:36:48.260
that time, the universe is expanding in terms of novelty. And it goes back to that Dan Dennett essay

02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:56.900
that we're talking about, the free will inflation. So the past, it did not exist in the past. The

02:36:56.900 --> 02:37:02.500
past exists in the present. What I mean is like, there was no past, there is only present.

02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:08.500
So I mean, you are the sum total, everything that occurs in the past is manifestly here in the

02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:14.100
present. And then you have this little echo state in your consciousness because you're able to

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:21.060
imagine something without actualization. But the fact you imagine it, that occurs in electrons and

02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:24.580
potassium ion flows in your neural network, in your brain.

02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.340
Maybe consciousness is just the present.

02:37:27.300 --> 02:37:33.860
So somehow you imagine that and then by imagining, oh, that's good. Yeah. I'm going to make a robot

02:37:33.860 --> 02:37:39.700
that do this thing and program it. And then you physically then go and do it. So that then

02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:47.140
changes the future. Sorry. What's imagination? Does it require the past? Does it require the

02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:52.980
future? Does it require memory? Does it? It's imagination. Does it only exist in the moment?

02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:59.060
So imagination is, well, yeah, probably it's an instantaneous readout of what's going on.

02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:03.860
You can maybe, your subconscious brain has been generating all the bits for it. But no,

02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:11.060
imagination occurs when you, in your game engine, you remember the past and you integrate sensory

02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:14.820
the present and you try and work out what you want to do in the future. And then you go and

02:38:14.820 --> 02:38:20.820
make that happen. So the imagination is like, asking what imagination is about, asking what

02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:27.460
surfing is. You can see, you can surfboard surfer wave coming in. When you're on that wave and

02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:33.780
you're surfing, that's where the imagination is. I think, I think imagination is just accessing

02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:37.220
things that aren't the present moment in the present moment. So like I can, I'm sitting here

02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:43.860
and I'm looking at the table and I can imagine the river in things or whatever it was. And so

02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:50.020
it seems to be that it's like, it's our ability to access things that aren't present.

02:38:50.020 --> 02:38:57.220
But to conjure up worlds, some of them might be akin to something that happened to you recently.

02:38:57.220 --> 02:39:00.980
Right, but they don't have to be things that actually happened in your past. And I think

02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:05.380
this gets back to assembly theory. Like the way I would think about imagination from an assembly

02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:12.500
theoretic standpoint is I'm a giant causal graph. And I exist in a present moment as a particular

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:18.740
configuration of Sarah. And, but there's a lot of, I carry a lot of evolutionary baggage. I have

02:39:18.740 --> 02:39:23.620
that whole causal history and I can access parts of it. Now, when you talk about getting

02:39:23.620 --> 02:39:28.740
to something as complex as us, having as large an assembly space as us, there's ways of like,

02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:33.940
there's a lot of things in that causal graph that have ever actually never existed in the past

02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:38.900
history of the universe. Cause like the universe got big enough to contain the three of us in this

02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:47.860
room in time, but not all the features of each one of us individually have come into existence

02:39:47.860 --> 02:39:50.980
as physical objects we would recognize as individual objects. This goes back to your

02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:56.100
point that we actually have to explain why things actually even look like objects and

02:39:56.100 --> 02:40:03.860
aren't just a smear of mass. And just on the free will and physics thing, when you were talking,

02:40:04.420 --> 02:40:07.540
I just want to bring this up because I think it's a really interesting viewpoint that Nicholas

02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:12.260
Jisen has that, you know, like we want to use the laws of physics and then say you can't have free

02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:16.980
will. And his point is you have to have free will in order to even choose to set up an experiment

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:21.220
to test the laws of physics. So in some sense, free will should be more fundamental than physics

02:40:21.220 --> 02:40:28.180
is because to even do science, there's some assumption that the agents have free will.

02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:33.860
And I always thought it was really perplexing that, you know, physics wants to remove agency

02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:37.540
because the idea that I could do an experiment here on this part of earth and then I can move

02:40:37.540 --> 02:40:41.380
somewhere else and prepare an identically, you know, identically prepared experiment,

02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:46.100
run an experiment again, seems to imply something about the structure of our universe that is not

02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:48.420
encoded in the laws that we're testing in those experiments.

02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:52.660
So this kind of dream of physics that you can do multiple experiments,

02:40:52.660 --> 02:40:58.580
different locations and then validate each other, you're saying that's an illusion?

02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:03.380
No, I'm saying that requires decision making and free will to be a real thing, I think.

02:41:04.020 --> 02:41:09.860
Like I think the fact that we can do science is not arbitrary. And I think people, you know,

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:13.300
the standard canon in physics would be, well, you could trace all of that back to the initial

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:17.540
condition in the universe, but the whole point of science is I can imagine doing the experiment

02:41:17.540 --> 02:41:20.580
and I can do it and then I can do it again and again and again all over the planet.

02:41:20.580 --> 02:41:25.060
Do your imagination somehow fundamentally generative of novelty?

02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:25.220
Yes.

02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:28.820
So it's not like the universe could have predicted the things you imagined?

02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:33.380
Imagination super, so coming back to novelty, I think novelty can exist outside of imagination,

02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:36.900
but it supercharges it. It's another transition, I think. I mean, I would say,

02:41:37.460 --> 02:41:40.660
I mean, this may be a boring statement, but I would say the fact that, sorry?

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:42.580
I'm not sure. These are hard questions.

02:41:42.580 --> 02:41:48.340
Yeah, I mean, I think the fact that objects exist is yet another proof that time is fundamental

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:53.460
and novelty exists, right? Because I think, again, if you ask a physicist to write down in

02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:57.940
their infinite Bible of the universe, let's call it the Bible, the math, you know.

02:41:57.940 --> 02:41:58.580
That book.

02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:03.700
Yeah, well, I mean, the mathematical universe, whether you're Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll

02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:10.260
or Frank Wilczek or Stephen Wolfram, okay?

02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:11.140
Yeah.

02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:12.100
I like that book.

02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:14.340
Yeah, I love it, too. Lots of pretty pictures.

02:42:14.980 --> 02:42:19.700
It's really interesting that they cope with the enormity of the universe by saying, well,

02:42:19.700 --> 02:42:23.380
it's all there, mathematics, it all exists, right? And I would say that

02:42:24.180 --> 02:42:29.220
that's why I'm excited about the future of the universe, because although it is somehow

02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:37.940
dependent upon the past, it is not constrained just by the past, which is kind of mad.

02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:43.540
Yeah, that's what free will is. It's not constrained by the past. It's dependent on the past.

02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:48.900
This moment, it's not just dependent. This moment is the past, and yet it has the

02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:52.740
capacity to generate a totally unpredictable future.

02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:56.260
I mean, the other thing I would say is super important for human beings, right?

02:42:56.260 --> 02:42:59.780
Human beings have actually very little causal control in the future.

02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:01.940
I realized this the other week.

02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:03.380
Oh, the immediate future, I mean.

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:09.220
Yeah, yeah. So this is what I think it is. By reinterpreting your past, I mean,

02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:14.820
talk about from a kind of psychological cognitive point of view, by reinterpreting your past

02:43:16.020 --> 02:43:20.420
in your current mind, you can actually help shape your future again.

02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:28.020
You have much more freedom to interpret your past, to act in the present, to change your future

02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:31.540
than you do to change your future. I may sound weird, so I'm saying to everybody,

02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:36.820
imagine your past, think about your past, reinterpret your past in the nicest way you can,

02:43:37.380 --> 02:43:41.380
then imagine what you can do next, or imagine your past in a more negative way in what you

02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:44.340
do next, and look at those two counterfactuals. They're different.

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:48.340
Yeah, it's fascinating. I mean, Daniel Kahnema talks about this, that most of our life is lived

02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:52.340
in our memories. It's interesting because you can essentially, in imagination,

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:56.260
choose the life you live. So maybe free will exists in imagination.

02:43:57.220 --> 02:44:03.780
Choices are made in your imagination, and that results in you basically able to control how the

02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:11.220
future unrolls because you're like, reinterpreting constantly the things that happen to you.

02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:16.260
Exactly. If you want to increase your amount of free will, those people that have most ... I

02:44:16.260 --> 02:44:24.260
don't think everyone has equal amounts of agency because of our sad constraints, whether happenstance,

02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:32.660
health, economic, born in a certain place. But those of us that have the ability to go

02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:39.540
back and reinterpret our past and use that to change the future are the ones that exert

02:44:39.540 --> 02:44:48.260
most agency in the present. I want to achieve higher degrees of agency and enable everyone

02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:51.780
else to do that as well, to have more fun in the universe.

02:44:51.780 --> 02:44:54.340
Then we'll hit that peak, the maximum fun point.

02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:58.660
I don't think there's ever going to be a maximum ... I think the wonderful thing about the future

02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:02.420
is there's always going to be more fun. Yeah. You, I think, again, going back to

02:45:04.180 --> 02:45:08.740
Twitter, I think you, Lee, tweeted something about being a life maximalist that you want

02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:18.580
to maximize the amount of life in the universe. The more general version of that goal is to

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:22.260
maximize the amount of fun in the universe because life is a subset of fun. There are all

02:45:22.260 --> 02:45:28.100
kinds of ... I suppose they're either correlated or exactly equal. I don't know. Anyway, speaking

02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:34.260
of fun, let me ask you about alien sightings. There's been quite a bit of UFO sightings and

02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:44.180
all that kind of stuff. What do you think would be the first time when humans sight aliens,

02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:52.340
see aliens in a sort of unquestionable way, this extremely strong and arguable way?

02:45:54.100 --> 02:46:01.540
We've made contact with aliens. Sarah, what would it look like? Obviously, the space of possibilities

02:46:02.180 --> 02:46:07.620
is huge here, but if you were to look into the future, what would that look like? Would it be

02:46:07.620 --> 02:46:15.860
inklings of UFOs here and there that slowly unravel the mystery or would it be an obvious

02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:22.340
overwhelming signal? I think we have an obsession with making contact with events.

02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:30.820
What I mean by that is people have a UFO sighting, they make contact. I always think

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:37.460
you know, what's interesting to me about the UFO narratives right now is not that I have a

02:46:37.460 --> 02:46:42.260
disbelief about what people are experiencing or feeling, but the discussion right now is

02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:50.100
at the level of modern mythology. Aliens are our mythos in modern culture. When you treat it like

02:46:50.100 --> 02:46:56.980
that, then I want to think about when do things that we traditionally only regularize through

02:46:56.980 --> 02:47:03.380
mythology actually become things that become standard knowledge? It used to be variations

02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:07.460
in the climate were described by some kind of gods or something and now it's like our technology

02:47:07.460 --> 02:47:12.980
picks up an anomaly or someone sees something, we say it's aliens. I think the real thing is

02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:18.500
it's not contact with events, but first contact is actually contact with knowledge of the phenomena

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:25.060
or the explanation. This is very subtle and very abstract, but when does it become something that

02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:30.100
we actually understand what it is that we're talking about? That's first contact. Would you

02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:36.820
make the myth, would you give credit to the myth, the mythology as first contact? I think yes. I

02:47:36.820 --> 02:47:40.980
think it's the rudimentary that we have some understanding that there's a phenomena that we

02:47:40.980 --> 02:47:46.500
have to understand and regularize. To understand that there is weather, you have to construct the

02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:53.380
pathology around that weather. It's something that's controllable. I see mythology basically

02:47:53.380 --> 02:48:01.940
as baby knowledge. It could be that although there's lots of alien sight, so-called alien

02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:05.460
sightings, so there is a number of things you can do. You could just dismiss them and say they're

02:48:05.460 --> 02:48:09.860
not true. They're kind of made up or you say, well, there's something interesting here. We keep

02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:14.900
seeing a commonality. We see the same phenomena again and again and again. Also, there's this

02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:20.260
interesting thing about human imagination. Even if they are, let's not say made up, but

02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:26.980
misappropriated other inputs. The fact that human consciousness is capable of imagining

02:48:26.980 --> 02:48:31.940
contact with aliens, does that not tell us about something about where we are in our position,

02:48:31.940 --> 02:48:35.300
in our culture, in our technology? It tells us about where in time we are.

02:48:35.300 --> 02:48:41.460
Could it be that we're making contact with, let's say, let's take the most miserable version. There

02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:46.420
are no aliens in the universe. Life is only on earth. The interpretation of that is we're

02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:51.140
desperate to understand why we're the only life in the universe. The other one is the

02:48:51.140 --> 02:48:55.700
other most extreme is that aliens are visiting all the time and we're just not able to capture

02:48:55.700 --> 02:49:01.460
them coherently or there's a big conspiracy and there's Area 51 and there are lizards everywhere

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:08.340
and there's that. I'm kind of in favor of the idea that maybe humanity is waking up to the idea that

02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:13.300
we aren't alone in the universe and we're just running the simulation and we're seeing some

02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:20.420
evidence. We don't know what life is yet. We do have some anomalies out there. We can't explain

02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:30.740
everything and over time we will start to unpack that. One very plausible thing we might do,

02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:37.620
which might be boring for the average alien observer or believes that aliens are, as in

02:49:37.620 --> 02:49:41.780
intelligent aliens, are visiting earth, it could be that we might go to the outer solar system

02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:48.340
and find a new type of life that has completely new chemistry. Bring these cells back to earth

02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:54.820
where you could say my hand on earth, here's RNA, DNA and proteins and look cells self-replicate

02:49:54.820 --> 02:50:00.500
from Titan. We have this new set of molecules, new set of cells and we feed it stuff and it grows.

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:08.980
That for me, if we were able to do that, which would be like the most that would be my UFO sighting.

02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:17.700
That's a good test. You feed it and it grows. Not until you know how to feed the thing

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:24.740
it grows somehow. We can make a comic book, the tiger that came for tea,

02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:31.220
the alien that came for tea. What would you say is between the two of you is the biggest

02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:38.980
disagreement about alien life out there? Is it from the basic framework of thinking about

02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:44.980
what is life to maybe what aliens look like, to alien civilizations, to UFO sightings?

02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:52.820
What would you think? I would say the biggest one is that the emergence of life does not have to be

02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:59.620
that it can't just happen once on the planet, that it could be two or more life forms present

02:50:59.620 --> 02:51:06.580
on a planet at once. I think Sarah doesn't agree with that. I think that's logically inconsistent.

02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:14.820
That's really polite. You're saying it's nonsense. How likely is that? What does it look like? Let's

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:20.740
imagine two alien civilizations coexisting on a planet. What's that look like exactly?

02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:29.300
I think I've got to get around your argument. Let's say on this planet there's just like

02:51:29.300 --> 02:51:36.100
there's lots of available chemistry and one life form gets emerges based on carbon and interacts

02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:42.580
and there's an ecosystem based on carbon and there's an orthogonal and so it's planetary

02:51:42.580 --> 02:51:48.980
phenomena which is what you I think, but there's also one that goes on silicon and because there's

02:51:48.980 --> 02:51:55.300
enough energy and there's enough stuff that these life forms might not actually necessarily compete

02:51:56.260 --> 02:52:00.420
evolutionarily. Yeah, but they would have to not interact at all because they're going to be

02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:04.420
co-constructing each other's causal chains. I think that's what you just got me. So there's no

02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:11.140
overlap in terms of their causal chains or very limited overlap. Yeah, so I think the only way I

02:52:11.140 --> 02:52:16.820
can get away with that is to say, right, life could emerge on a planet underneath and the lizard

02:52:16.900 --> 02:52:24.740
people under the crust of the earth. I think, but look as you can see we just agree. So

02:52:24.740 --> 02:52:30.100
and I think Sarah actually has convinced me because of that life is a planetary phenomena,

02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:35.540
the emergence of life is a planetary phenomena and actually because of the way evolution and

02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:40.420
selection works then nothing occurs in isolation. The causal chains interact so there is a common,

02:52:40.420 --> 02:52:44.660
there's a consensus model for life on the earth. But you don't think you can place aliens

02:52:45.620 --> 02:52:52.180
from elsewhere onto the, can't you just place multiple alien civilizations on one planet?

02:52:52.180 --> 02:52:58.500
Right, but I think so you can take two original life events that were independent and co-mingle

02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:05.700
them but I don't think when you're talking about, when you look at the interaction of that structure

02:53:07.860 --> 02:53:11.860
it's like the same idea as like an experiment being an example of life, right? That's a really

02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:17.460
abstract and subtle concept and I guess what I'm saying is life is information propagating

02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:23.460
through matter so once you start having things interacting they in some sense co-mingle and

02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:32.260
they become part of the same chain. The co-mingling starts quickly, we proceed to co-mingle quickly.

02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:37.940
Right, right. So you could say, so the question is then, the more interesting question is are

02:53:37.940 --> 02:53:42.340
there two distinct origins events and I still think that there's reasons that on a single

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:48.900
planet you would have one origins event because of the time scales of cycling, of geochemistry

02:53:48.900 --> 02:53:53.300
on a planet and also the fact that I don't think that the origin of life happens in a pool and

02:53:53.300 --> 02:53:57.620
like radiates outward through evolutionary processes. I think it's a multi-scale phenomenon,

02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:02.020
it happens at the level of individual molecules interacting, collections of molecules interacting

02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:07.860
in entire planetary scale cycles. So life as we know it has always been multi-scale

02:54:07.860 --> 02:54:13.060
and there's brilliant examples of individual mutations at the genome level changing global

02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:19.060
climate, right? So there's a tight coupling between things that happen at the largest

02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:24.820
scale of our planetary scale and the smallest scale that life mediates. But it still might be

02:54:24.820 --> 02:54:30.020
difficult within something you would call as a single alien civilization, you know,

02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:35.380
there's species and stuff and they might not be able to communicate. But you're asking about life,

02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:43.540
not species, right? So what's the difference between one living civilization? This is almost

02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:50.340
like a category question versus species because it can be very different in the way evolution

02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:55.620
because there's like literally islands that you can involve different kinds of turtles and stuff

02:54:55.700 --> 02:55:00.420
and they can be weird in different ways. So I guess what I'm saying is if you look at the structure

02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:08.580
of two interacting living things, populations, and you look in their past and they have independent

02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:12.740
origins for their causal chain, then you would say one was alien, you know, they have different

02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:17.060
independent origins events. But if you look at their future by virtue of the fact they're

02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:23.540
interacting, their causal chains have become co-mingled so that in the future they are not

02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:30.180
independent. So that's why you would even define them as alien. So the structure across time

02:55:30.740 --> 02:55:35.300
is two examples of life become one example of life because life is the entire structure

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:40.500
across time. But there could be a lot of variation within it. Yeah, so the question we're all

02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:47.380
interested in is how many independent origins of a complexifying causal chain are there in the

02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:57.540
universe? See, but the idea of origin is easy for you to define because like when the two when

02:55:57.540 --> 02:56:06.100
the species split in the evolutionary process and you get like a a dolphin versus a human

02:56:06.100 --> 02:56:12.740
or neanderthal versus homo sapien, that isn't there? Let me make a distinction here quickly.

02:56:12.820 --> 02:56:19.940
So I think, sorry to interrupt, what we're saying, I mean, I mean, I mean, Sarah won that argument

02:56:19.940 --> 02:56:25.060
because I think she's right that once the causal chains interact and going forward, so we're talking

02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:29.380
about a number of things. Let's go all the way back before origin of life, origin life on Earth,

02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:34.340
chemistry emerges. So there's all these, I would say there's probably mechanistically,

02:56:35.140 --> 02:56:39.460
the chemistry is desperately trying to find any way to get a replica is the ribosome kind of

02:56:40.260 --> 02:56:42.740
was really rubbish at the beginning and they just competed, competed, competed,

02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:47.220
and you got better and better ribosomes. Suddenly, that was a technology. The ribosome is the

02:56:47.220 --> 02:56:53.540
technology that way, boom, allowed evolution to start. So the why I was trying to why interrupted

02:56:53.540 --> 02:57:00.660
you is say that once evolution is started using that technology, then you can speciate. And I was

02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:06.100
trying to and I think what Sarah said was convinced me of because I was like, no, we have lots of

02:57:06.100 --> 02:57:10.660
different chemistry shadow biosphere on Earth. And she's like, no, no, no, you have to have this,

02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:18.020
you have to get to this minimum evolutionary machine. And then when that occurs, speciation

02:57:18.020 --> 02:57:24.260
occurs exactly what it's like dolphins, humans, everything on Earth. But when you're looking at

02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:29.380
aliens or alien life, there's not going to be two different types of chemistry because they compete,

02:57:29.380 --> 02:57:33.860
they compete and interact and cooperate because the causal chains overlap. One might kill the

02:57:33.860 --> 02:57:39.220
other one might combine with the other and then you go on. And then you have this kind of this

02:57:39.220 --> 02:57:44.420
average and show there might be speciation, it might be have two types of emerging chemistry,

02:57:44.420 --> 02:57:49.940
it almost looks like the origin of life on Earth required two different pre life forms,

02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:56.580
the peptide world and the RNA world. Somehow they got together and by combining, you got the ribosome

02:57:56.580 --> 02:58:02.340
and that was the minimum competent entity for evolution. And would all alien civilizations

02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:09.140
have an evolutionary process on a planet? So like that's one of the almost it's almost the

02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:15.220
definition of life to create all those memories, you have to have something change in time.

02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:17.060
Yeah, and then but there has to be selection.

02:58:19.460 --> 02:58:22.020
That's like an efficient there's no other way to do it.

02:58:22.020 --> 02:58:28.020
No, well, never say never consider say that part that depresses me though going back to like,

02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:31.620
I don't know the earlier discussion on violence and things like and I don't know where

02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:36.660
somebody was tweeting about this recently, but like, you know, how much stuff had to die.

02:58:37.300 --> 02:58:38.580
Maybe it was you. Yeah.

02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:48.420
We're talking about life. And I guess a lot of murder had to occur.

02:58:48.420 --> 02:58:52.580
Right. So selection means things had to be weeded out. Right. So

02:58:52.580 --> 02:58:55.380
we can celebrate that death makes way for it.

02:58:55.380 --> 02:58:59.380
Yeah, I mean, it is. And also, you know, one of the most interesting features of

02:58:59.380 --> 02:59:04.660
major extinction events in the history of our planet is how much novelty emerged immediately

02:59:04.660 --> 02:59:09.060
after. Right. So and of course, you know, a lot of people make arguments we wouldn't be here if the

02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:16.500
dinosaurs didn't go extinct. So in some ways, we can attribute our existence to all of that.

02:59:16.500 --> 02:59:21.620
But I guess I was just wondering and sort of like, if I was going to build a universe myself,

02:59:22.500 --> 02:59:25.860
in the most optimistic way, would I retain that feature? But it does seem to be a

02:59:26.180 --> 02:59:29.140
have to. I mean, I think we're, I think we're probably being over

02:59:30.100 --> 02:59:34.340
anthropomorphizing. I remember watching the blue, I think it was the blue planet, David Attenborough

02:59:34.340 --> 02:59:38.420
was showing these seals and because of climate change, some seals were falling off a cliff

02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:43.700
and how tragic that was. I was like, I'm saying my son, that's pretty cool. Look at, look at those

02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:47.060
ones down there. They've obviously got some kind of mutations, some, and they're not doing that

02:59:47.060 --> 02:59:52.820
daft thing. And so that, that, that poor gene will be weeded out. Of course, at the individual

02:59:52.820 --> 02:59:57.700
level, it looks tragic. And of course, as human beings have the ability to abstract and we empathize,

02:59:57.700 --> 03:00:01.300
we don't want to cause suffering on other human beings. And we should retain that,

03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:07.380
but we shouldn't look back in time and say, you know, how many butterflies had to die?

03:00:08.260 --> 03:00:14.340
I remember making, how many, if you think about the caterpillar become the chrysalis and then the

03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:20.340
butterfly getting out, how many, if that suffering, we call it suffering, if that process of pruning

03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:25.140
had not occurred, we have no butterflies. So none of the butterfly beauty in the world

03:00:25.140 --> 03:00:30.740
without all that pruning. So pruning is required, but we shouldn't empathomorphize and feel sorry

03:00:30.740 --> 03:00:36.740
for the biological entities because that's, that seems to be a backwards way of looking at it.

03:00:36.740 --> 03:00:42.340
What we should do is project forward and maybe think about what values we have across our species

03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:47.140
and our ecosystem and our fellow human beings. You know, you know, now that we know that animals

03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:52.980
suffer at some level, think about humane farming. When we find that plants can, in fact,

03:00:52.980 --> 03:00:59.140
are conscious and can think and have pain, then we'll do humane gardening. Until that point,

03:00:59.140 --> 03:01:06.660
we won't do it, right? I like this. Famous chemist endorses the majestic nature of murder.

03:01:08.180 --> 03:01:14.660
That's the title. I didn't say that, but okay. Well, I just insert. I have a hard time with it,

03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:20.740
though. I think the way you put it, it's kind of. But it's the reality of, it's the reality of,

03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.460
it is beautiful. You know, there's an Instagram account called nature is metal.

03:01:26.820 --> 03:01:31.860
And I keep following it, unfollowing it because I can't handle it for prolonged periods of time.

03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:37.780
We evolve together, you die alone. Yeah. We evolve together, but you die alone.

03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:43.140
So I. We live alone too. It's a Gatsby thing. I don't know. We evolve together. Where's the

03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:47.940
together? The together is the murder and the sex. Sex and murder.

03:01:47.940 --> 03:01:51.300
My romantic vision of it to try to make me happy, Sarah, instead of sad Sarah,

03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:58.500
I talk in third person when I think very abstractly, sorry, is, you know, like this whole,

03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:02.740
like certain things can coexist. So the universe is trying to maximize existence,

03:02:02.740 --> 03:02:09.060
but there's some things that just aren't the most productive trajectory together,

03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:14.020
but it doesn't mean that they don't exist on another timeline or another chain somewhere else.

03:02:14.020 --> 03:02:18.260
Like I, like, and maybe you would call that like then some kind of multiverser things, but

03:02:18.900 --> 03:02:23.540
what am I saying? I think you can't, I just, you can't go down. I'm just making stuff up.

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:30.580
No, you're not. I don't understand. Is it logical? And we need. No, I know. If you look at bacteria,

03:02:30.580 --> 03:02:35.380
if you look at virus, I mean, just, just the number of organisms that are constantly looking

03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:38.500
at bacteria, they're just dying nonstop. It's like a slaughter.

03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:41.460
Right. Well, and this goes back to the conversation about God. I mean, like there's

03:02:41.460 --> 03:02:44.180
the whole thing about like, why is the universe enabled suffering?

03:02:44.180 --> 03:02:50.180
Individuals don't exist. Right. So for this, I think if you think about life as an entity on earth,

03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:55.620
right, let's just, let's just go back a second. I mean, I like to, I'll be ludicrous for a second.

03:02:55.620 --> 03:03:01.780
I don't exist. You don't exist. Right. But you, but the actions you do, the product of evolution

03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:07.860
exists, right. The objects you create exist quantitatively in the real world. If you then

03:03:07.860 --> 03:03:12.980
understand life on earth or alien life or any life in the universe, there's this integrated entity

03:03:13.620 --> 03:03:18.020
where you need, you need cells in your body to die. Otherwise you'd just get really big

03:03:18.740 --> 03:03:22.820
and you wouldn't be able to walk around. Right. So, you know, you do.

03:03:22.820 --> 03:03:29.220
Yeah. Yeah. So I think the patterns that persist, not the physical things.

03:03:29.220 --> 03:03:34.340
And of course we, you know, we have, we have, we place immense values on fellow human beings and

03:03:34.340 --> 03:03:40.340
I'm majestic professor does like other individual human beings. Now you're talking in third person

03:03:40.340 --> 03:03:44.660
too. I know it happens. Right. So death would just say, I mean, because you said evolution

03:03:44.660 --> 03:03:50.020
is a fundamental part of life. So death is a fundamental part of life. Yeah.

03:03:51.700 --> 03:03:56.020
It might, right now it might not be in the future. We might hack some aspects of death

03:03:56.580 --> 03:04:01.460
because we evolve in different ways. But isn't there, I think Sarah mentioned like this life

03:04:01.460 --> 03:04:10.580
density. Can't that become a problem? Like too much, too much bureaucracy, too much baggage

03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:15.700
builds up. Like you need to keep erasing stuff. I think it's okay that we dissipate. Like, I don't

03:04:15.700 --> 03:04:21.620
think of like, like, I mean, no, but I mean, like, like we're so fixated on ourselves as individuals

03:04:21.620 --> 03:04:26.180
and agents. And we were talking about this last night actually over dinner, but like,

03:04:27.140 --> 03:04:31.620
you know, an individual persists for a certain amount of time. But what you want to do, like,

03:04:31.620 --> 03:04:35.940
if you're really concerned with immortality is not to live indefinitely as an individual,

03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:39.540
but maximize your causal impact. So like, what are the traces of you that are left?

03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:45.620
And you're still a real, I always think of Einstein, like for a period of time,

03:04:45.620 --> 03:04:50.660
he was a real physical thing. We identify as a human and now we just see echoes of that human

03:04:50.660 --> 03:04:54.660
in all of the ways that we talk about his, you know, causal implac or frankly,

03:04:54.660 --> 03:04:57.940
right, is another great example. How many Easter eggs could you leave in the future?

03:04:59.700 --> 03:05:05.940
So I guess the question is how much do you want to control the localization of a certain features

03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:12.820
of say a prop, a packet of propagating information we might call person and keep them localized to

03:05:12.820 --> 03:05:16.420
one individual physical structure? Or do you want to, you know, is there a time when that

03:05:16.420 --> 03:05:22.580
just becomes a dissipated feature of the society that it once existed in? And I'm okay with the

03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:27.060
dissipated feature because I just think that makes more room for more creativity in the future.

03:05:28.100 --> 03:05:34.340
So you mentioned engineering life in the lab. Let me take you to computer science world.

03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:38.180
What about robots? So

03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:44.340
so is it possible to engineer? You're really talking about

03:05:46.500 --> 03:05:51.540
like engineering life at the chemistry level, but do you think it's possible to engineer

03:05:52.580 --> 03:06:00.660
life at the humanoid level, at the dog level? Like, or is that like at which level can we

03:06:00.660 --> 03:06:07.060
instill the magic of life into inanimate stuff? No, I think you could do it at every level.

03:06:07.060 --> 03:06:12.900
I just think that we're particularly interested in chemistry because it's the origin life

03:06:12.900 --> 03:06:17.380
transition that presumably, or at least that's how I feel about it, it's going to give you the most

03:06:18.820 --> 03:06:25.300
and interesting or deepest insights into the physics. But presumably everything that we do

03:06:25.300 --> 03:06:29.540
and build is an example of life. And the question is just how much do you want to take from things

03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:35.860
that we have now and put them into like examples of life and copy them into machines? I saw that

03:06:35.860 --> 03:06:40.580
there was this tweet again. I think you were at the Mars conference and you were hanging out

03:06:40.580 --> 03:06:46.820
with a humanoid robot. Yes. That was a fun time. Making lots of new friends at Mars 2020. Did you

03:06:46.820 --> 03:06:52.900
guys color match ahead of time with the robot or did that accidentally happen? Accidentally, I went

03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:58.100
up and I wanted to say hi. Torquoise, would that be the correct name for the color? I think so.

03:06:58.100 --> 03:07:03.380
We didn't color coordinate our outfits. Well, you didn't, maybe the robot did. The robot probably

03:07:03.380 --> 03:07:09.300
did. Much more stylish. So for people who are just listening, there's a picture of Sarah standing

03:07:09.300 --> 03:07:15.140
next to a humanoid robot. I guess you like them with a small head and perfect vision. Actually,

03:07:15.140 --> 03:07:21.700
no, I just- I did that perfectly. There's a lidar. No, I mean, I think I was just deeply interested

03:07:21.700 --> 03:07:27.140
because- Sorry to interrupt. Was it manually controlled? Was it actually stabilizing itself?

03:07:27.140 --> 03:07:32.740
Oh no, it was walking around. Oh, nice. Yeah. Nice. It was pretty impressive. I mean,

03:07:32.740 --> 03:07:36.740
actually there's some videos online of Jeff Bezos walking with one of those across the lawn

03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:50.820
nearby there. This is great. Yeah. I wasn't invited. Yeah, but there you go. See?

03:07:51.860 --> 03:07:57.300
That's incredible, isn't it? Yeah. So you look at the walking robot. Where did the idea for walking

03:07:57.300 --> 03:08:02.020
come from? It was invented by evolution, right? And us as human beings, able to conceptualize

03:08:02.020 --> 03:08:08.100
and design and engineer. So that robot is evidence of life. And so I think what's going

03:08:08.100 --> 03:08:15.460
to happen is we want to find where the spark comes from mechanistically. How can you literally go

03:08:15.460 --> 03:08:20.660
from sand to cells? So that's the first transition that I think- There are a number of problems we

03:08:20.660 --> 03:08:26.100
want to do. Make life in the lab. Great. Then we want to make life in the lab and want to suddenly

03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:31.780
start to make intelligent life or life that can start to solve abstract problems. And then we want

03:08:31.780 --> 03:08:38.260
to make life that is conscious. Okay. In that order? I think it has to happen in that order.

03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:42.660
Getting towards this artificial general intelligence. I think that artificial

03:08:42.660 --> 03:08:47.540
general intelligence can't exist in a vacuum. It has to have a causal chain all the way back to

03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:52.260
Luca, right? Yeah. And so the question I think I really like the question is to say,

03:08:56.820 --> 03:09:01.540
is our pursuit of more and more lifelike? I know you like your robots. You want to project

03:09:01.540 --> 03:09:06.180
into them. You want to interact with them. I think you would want- If you have a robot

03:09:06.180 --> 03:09:09.220
dog and the robot dog does everything expected from a normal dog and you can't tell the difference,

03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:13.460
you're not really going to ask the question anymore if it's a real dog or not, or it's got

03:09:13.460 --> 03:09:18.020
a personality. You're interacting with it. And so I think what would be interesting would be to kind

03:09:18.020 --> 03:09:24.340
of understand the computational architecture, how that evolves, because you could then teleport

03:09:24.340 --> 03:09:30.020
the personality from one object to the other and say, right, does it act the same? And I think that

03:09:30.020 --> 03:09:37.940
as we go along, we're going to get better and better integrating our consciousness into machines.

03:09:37.940 --> 03:09:45.460
Well, let me ask you that question just to linger on it. I would call that a living conscious thing,

03:09:45.460 --> 03:09:52.740
potentially, I as a human allegedly, but would you as a person trying to define life,

03:09:53.540 --> 03:09:58.740
if you pass the Turing test, are you a life form? One of the reasons I walked up to the robot was

03:09:59.700 --> 03:10:10.020
because I wanted to meet the robot. It felt like I was- I base a lot of my interaction with reality

03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:14.820
on emotion and feeling, but how do you feel about an interaction? And I always love your point about

03:10:14.820 --> 03:10:18.900
is it enough to have that shared experience with a robot, right? So walking up to it,

03:10:18.900 --> 03:10:22.500
does it feel like you're interacting with a living thing? And it did to an extent,

03:10:22.500 --> 03:10:26.820
but in some degrees, it feels like you're interacting with a baby living thing.

03:10:26.900 --> 03:10:30.900
So I think our relationship with technology and particularly the robots we build is really

03:10:30.900 --> 03:10:36.260
interesting because basically, they exist as objects in our future in some sense, like we're

03:10:36.260 --> 03:10:41.780
a much older evolutionary lineage than robots are, but we're all part of the same causal chain.

03:10:42.340 --> 03:10:49.060
And presumably, they're kind of in their infancy. So it's almost like you're looking at the future

03:10:49.060 --> 03:10:56.100
of life when you're looking at them, but it hasn't really become life in a full manifestation of

03:10:56.100 --> 03:11:03.860
whatever it is that they're going to become. And the example of the walking robot was super

03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:08.420
interesting, but they also had a dolphin that they put in the pool at the cocktail party at Mars,

03:11:08.420 --> 03:11:14.340
and it looked just like a real dolphin swimming in the pool. And it's in this kind of uncanny

03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:20.500
valley because- and I was having this conversation with a gentleman named Mutu who was super

03:11:20.500 --> 03:11:24.180
perceptive, but he was basically saying it made him feel really uncomfortable.

03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:26.740
And I think- The dolphin.

03:11:27.300 --> 03:11:31.780
Yeah. And I think a lot of people would have that response. And I guess my point about it is,

03:11:31.780 --> 03:11:35.940
it is kind of interesting because you're basically trying to make a thing that you think is non-living

03:11:36.980 --> 03:11:41.700
mimic a living thing. And so the thought experiment I would want to run in that case is imagine

03:11:41.700 --> 03:11:46.980
we replaced every living thing on earth with a robot equivalent, like all the dolphins and things.

03:11:47.060 --> 03:11:51.460
And in some sense, then you're making, if you think that the robots aren't experiencing reality,

03:11:51.460 --> 03:11:56.820
for example, in the way that a biologically evolved thing would, you're basically making

03:11:56.820 --> 03:12:03.700
the philosophical zombie argument become real and basically building reality into a simulation

03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:08.180
because you've made everything quote unquote fake in some sense. You've replaced everything

03:12:08.180 --> 03:12:13.380
with a physical simulation of it. So as opposed to being excited by the

03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:22.260
possibility of creating something new, you're terrified of humans being replaced.

03:12:22.260 --> 03:12:27.460
I was just trying to run what would be the absolute thought experiment, but I don't think

03:12:27.460 --> 03:12:32.820
that scenario would actually play out. I guess what I think is weird for why we feel this kind

03:12:32.820 --> 03:12:37.380
of uncanny valley interacting with something like the robot dolphin is we're looking at an object

03:12:37.380 --> 03:12:42.740
we know is kind of in the future in the sense of if everything's ordered in time, but it's borrowing

03:12:42.740 --> 03:12:47.460
from a structure that we have common history with, and it's basically copying in a kind of

03:12:47.460 --> 03:12:52.260
superficial way things from one part of the causal chain to another. Yeah.

03:12:53.140 --> 03:12:54.820
Well, that's a video.

03:12:55.700 --> 03:13:02.180
Everybody believed it was real. They look so real. And obviously the technology was

03:13:02.180 --> 03:13:07.380
developed for movies. But I think we're confusing our emotional response and understanding the

03:13:07.380 --> 03:13:12.420
causal chain of how we got there, right? Because the philosophical zombie argument thinks about

03:13:13.460 --> 03:13:17.620
objects just appearing, right? That you're facsimile in some way, whereas there is

03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:22.260
the cause of the chain of events that caused the dolphin to be built for a human being.

03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:25.460
Would a philosophical zombie still have a high assembly index?

03:13:25.460 --> 03:13:31.300
Yeah, because it can't be philosophical zombies can't like Boltzmann brains just

03:13:31.300 --> 03:13:34.980
can't appear out of nowhere. Well, I guess my question would be in that that scenario

03:13:34.980 --> 03:13:38.500
where you built all the robots and replaced everything on earth with robots with the biosphere

03:13:38.500 --> 03:13:41.220
be as creative under that scenario or not? Yeah.

03:13:41.220 --> 03:13:45.540
So are there are there quantitative differences you would notice over time?

03:13:45.540 --> 03:13:47.220
And it's not obvious either way, right?

03:13:47.220 --> 03:13:50.660
It's not obvious right now because we don't really we don't understand

03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:55.460
we haven't built into machines how we work. So that's I think that there are one of the big

03:13:55.460 --> 03:14:00.340
missing things I think that we're both looking for, right? It's a cute robot.

03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:05.540
But the point there is that the biosphere won't be as creative if you did it right now.

03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:08.660
No, of course, I think that's why. But in the future,

03:14:10.020 --> 03:14:18.100
we will be able to solve the problem of origin of life, intelligence and consciousness

03:14:19.220 --> 03:14:23.620
because they exist in physical substrates. We just don't understand enough about the material

03:14:23.620 --> 03:14:29.380
substrate and the causal chain. But I'm very confident we will get to an AGI. But it won't

03:14:29.380 --> 03:14:35.060
be what people think it won't be solution won't be a will get fooled a lot. And so GPT three is

03:14:35.060 --> 03:14:41.940
getting better at fooling us and GPT 153 might really fool us, but it won't have the magic we're

03:14:41.940 --> 03:14:48.500
looking for. It won't be a creative, but it will help us understand the differences between.

03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:52.740
Really though, because isn't that what love is being fooled?

03:14:54.660 --> 03:15:00.260
Like what why why are you not giving much value to the emotional connection with objects with

03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:01.700
with robots with humans?

03:15:01.780 --> 03:15:08.580
Emotion is a thing which happens when you're when you're the the your expectation function is

03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:13.300
is dashed and something else happens. Right? I mean, that's what emotion is.

03:15:13.300 --> 03:15:14.660
Is that what love is too?

03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:18.660
Yeah, you were expecting one thing and something else happened.

03:15:18.660 --> 03:15:20.180
Yeah, I don't know.

03:15:20.180 --> 03:15:21.380
I don't think that's true either.

03:15:21.380 --> 03:15:25.460
Well, what is it then? I think no emotion. Look, I'm sorry. Emotion is that but but

03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:27.620
I think love is just fulfilling your purpose.

03:15:28.180 --> 03:15:29.940
No, but I'll tell me look like look

03:15:29.940 --> 03:15:30.820
like whatever that means.

03:15:30.820 --> 03:15:32.660
I mean, really? So you're okay.

03:15:32.660 --> 03:15:34.500
But when are you happiest? It's like when you're all right.

03:15:34.500 --> 03:15:37.060
All right. Let me go back. If you want to if you want me to follow your bliss,

03:15:37.060 --> 03:15:42.020
let me define love quickly. Okay, go for it in terms of assembly space, right?

03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:42.980
Okay, excellent.

03:15:42.980 --> 03:15:44.980
I didn't think I'd be doing this today.

03:15:44.980 --> 03:15:49.700
I can't wait till assembly theory 101 is taught in the second lecture is assembly theory of love.

03:15:53.540 --> 03:15:55.940
Is being surprised the expectations being broken?

03:15:56.820 --> 03:15:58.500
No, go for it. I want to hear you.

03:15:58.500 --> 03:16:02.660
I'm not an emotional being. But I would say, so let's talk so we'll talk about emotion,

03:16:02.660 --> 03:16:07.460
but love is more complex is love is a very complex set of emotions together and logical stuff.

03:16:07.460 --> 03:16:13.140
But if you've got this thing, this person that's on this causal chain, that has this empathy for

03:16:13.140 --> 03:16:19.380
this other thing, love is being able to project ahead in your assembly space and work out what

03:16:19.380 --> 03:16:25.540
you're the person you're in love with has a need for and to do that for them without selflessly,

03:16:26.180 --> 03:16:29.380
right, because you can project ahead what they're going to need. And they are there and you

03:16:29.380 --> 03:16:32.900
maybe you can see someone is going to fall over, and you catch them before they fall over,

03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:36.820
or maybe you can anticipate that someone's going to be hungry. And without helping you,

03:16:36.820 --> 03:16:39.460
you just help them. That just sounds like empathy.

03:16:40.100 --> 03:16:44.580
But it's more complex than that, right? It's more complex. It's more about not just empathy,

03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:49.460
it's understanding. It's about kind of sharing that experience expression of love, though.

03:16:49.460 --> 03:16:54.500
That's not what it's like to feel love. Like feeling love is like, I like I think it's like

03:16:54.500 --> 03:16:59.860
when you're aligned with things that you feel like are your purpose or your reason for existing.

03:17:00.420 --> 03:17:06.420
So if you have those feelings towards the robot, why is that rope? I mean,

03:17:07.460 --> 03:17:11.860
because you said that the agent will build an AGI, but it will there'll be a fundamental

03:17:11.860 --> 03:17:15.060
difference in AGI. I don't think we'll build it's going to emerge from our technology.

03:17:15.060 --> 03:17:20.500
I think you guys will argue the same thing. I just said that GPT that we do not correctly

03:17:20.500 --> 03:17:27.140
capture the causal chain that we have within GPT. But don't you think it captures,

03:17:27.140 --> 03:17:35.780
because GPT-3 is fundamentally trained on a corpus of knowledge, you know, like the internet,

03:17:35.780 --> 03:17:39.940
don't you think it gets better and better and better at capturing the memory of all of them?

03:17:39.940 --> 03:17:46.020
It will be better at fooling you. And at some point you won't care. But when it comes,

03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:50.500
my guess, this is a quick, this is what I was getting to right before I got in the love trap.

03:17:51.220 --> 03:17:51.780
Love trap.

03:17:56.980 --> 03:17:58.420
Sounds like a good band name.

03:17:58.420 --> 03:18:04.180
Makes it sad. Okay. It's sad. Assembly space is sad. No, is that so short,

03:18:04.180 --> 03:18:08.900
but I think there are other features that allow that we pull on innovation

03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:14.100
that allow us to do more than what we just see in GPT-3. So if you're being fooled there.

03:18:14.100 --> 03:18:19.860
So I think what I mean is human beings have this ability to be surprising and creative. Whereas

03:18:19.860 --> 03:18:26.740
is it Dali? This thing, or if you take GPT-3 is not going to create a new verb.

03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:34.340
Shakespeare created new verbs. You're like, wow. And that required Shakespeare to think outside of

03:18:34.340 --> 03:18:40.020
language in a different domain. So I think having that connections across multiple domains is what

03:18:40.020 --> 03:18:45.700
you need for AGI. Yeah, but I don't know if you need that. I don't know if there's any limitations

03:18:45.700 --> 03:18:54.660
to GPT and not being able to be cross domain. The number one problem is instantiated in resource

03:18:54.660 --> 03:19:02.980
limited substrate and that we don't in Silicon. The architect was used for training for learning.

03:19:03.060 --> 03:19:10.180
It is about falling. It's not about understanding. And I think that there is some understanding that

03:19:10.180 --> 03:19:16.980
we have that is not yet symbolically representable. Language, learning language and using language

03:19:16.980 --> 03:19:24.100
seems to be fundamentally about fooling, not understanding. Why do you use language exactly?

03:19:24.100 --> 03:19:29.940
I might disagree with that quite fundamentally, actually. But I don't, I'm not sure I understand

03:19:29.940 --> 03:19:37.620
how I make a coherent argument for that. But my feeling is that there is comprehension

03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:45.460
in reality, in our consciousness below language. And we use those for language,

03:19:45.460 --> 03:19:50.260
for all sorts of expressions. And we don't yet understand that there's a gap. We will get there.

03:19:50.260 --> 03:19:55.300
But I'm saying, wouldn't it be interesting? It's a bit like saying, could I facsimile you or Sarah

03:19:55.300 --> 03:20:00.980
into a new human being? And let's just say I could copy all your atoms and the positions

03:20:00.980 --> 03:20:07.220
of all your atoms and electrons into this other person, they would be you. The answer is no.

03:20:07.220 --> 03:20:12.100
And it's quite easy to show using assembly theory, because actually the feature space you have,

03:20:12.100 --> 03:20:17.540
that graph, the only way to copy you is to create you on that graph. So everything that's happened

03:20:17.540 --> 03:20:21.380
to you in your past, we have to have a faithful record for. If you want another copy of Lex,

03:20:21.380 --> 03:20:25.460
you have to do the exact thing. One other copy of Sarah, one other copy of Lee, the exact

03:20:25.460 --> 03:20:30.020
past has to be replicated. Let me push back on that a little bit. That's maybe from an assembly

03:20:30.020 --> 03:20:36.020
theory perspective. But it, I don't think it's that difficult to recreate a version of me,

03:20:36.020 --> 03:20:44.260
like a clone, that would make everybody exactly equally as happy. Like they wouldn't care which

03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:50.020
one and like there's two of me. And then they get to pick which one and they'll kill either one,

03:20:50.020 --> 03:20:53.860
they'll be fine as long as they're forced to kill. They'll be fine. But here's what will happen is

03:20:53.860 --> 03:20:58.820
let's say we make artificial Lex and it was like, wow, so cool. It looks the same interact. Then

03:20:58.820 --> 03:21:01.780
there'll be this battle of like, right, we're going to tell the difference. We're going to,

03:21:01.780 --> 03:21:06.660
we're going to basically keep nudging Lex and artificial Lex until we get

03:21:07.700 --> 03:21:13.460
in novelty from one and we'll kill the other one. And I think, thank God, we're not novelty is a

03:21:13.460 --> 03:21:18.740
fuzzy concept. That's the whole problem of novelty. So I will define novelty. It's not fuzzy.

03:21:18.740 --> 03:21:28.500
Novelty is the ability for you to create architectures that are, or create an architecture.

03:21:28.500 --> 03:21:31.620
So let's say you've got corpus of architectures known, you can write down, you've got some

03:21:31.620 --> 03:21:36.820
distance measure and then I create a new one and the distance measure is so far away from what you'd

03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:44.180
expected. There's no linear algebra we're going to get there. It's like, that is creativity and we

03:21:44.180 --> 03:21:48.900
don't know how to do that yet on any level. Well, I was also thinking about like your argument

03:21:48.900 --> 03:21:53.460
about free will. Like you wouldn't be able to know it was, it doesn't work instantaneously.

03:21:53.460 --> 03:21:57.860
It's not like a micro level thing, but more a macro level thing over the scale of trajectories

03:21:57.860 --> 03:22:03.780
or longer-term decisions. So if you think that the novelty manifests over those longer timescales,

03:22:03.780 --> 03:22:11.540
it might be the two Lexes diverge quite a bit over certain timescales of their behavior.

03:22:11.620 --> 03:22:18.180
Nobody would notice the difference. They might not. And the universe,

03:22:18.180 --> 03:22:21.540
the earth won't notice the difference. The universe won't notice. The universe would

03:22:21.540 --> 03:22:25.540
notice the difference. No, the universe doesn't know about its novelty that's being generated.

03:22:25.540 --> 03:22:30.580
That's the whole point of novelty. This is what selection is, right? It's like taking nearly

03:22:30.580 --> 03:22:36.100
equivalent ones and then deciding like the universe selects, right? So whatever selection is,

03:22:36.100 --> 03:22:40.180
select some things to persist in time. Yeah, it's going to select the artificial one.

03:22:40.260 --> 03:22:44.660
So it likes that one better, but you're mixing up two arguments here. So look, let's go back a

03:22:44.660 --> 03:22:50.180
second. What are you basing this argument on? I'm just saying that I kind of don't think,

03:22:50.180 --> 03:22:57.860
because at least said that it's not possible. Like if you, if you copy every single molecule

03:22:57.860 --> 03:23:04.340
in a person's body, that's not going to be the same person. That they won't have the same

03:23:04.340 --> 03:23:08.820
assembly index. It won't have, it won't be the same person. I just don't, I think copying,

03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:14.580
you can compress. Not only do I disagree with that, I just, I think you can even compress a

03:23:14.580 --> 03:23:20.180
person down to some where you can fool the universe. I'm saying, let me restate it. It is

03:23:20.180 --> 03:23:27.460
not possible to copy somebody on because you, unless you copy the causal history. Also, you

03:23:27.460 --> 03:23:31.620
can't have two identical. I mean, actually I really like the idea that everything in the universe is

03:23:31.620 --> 03:23:35.940
unique. So even if like there were two, I know you like that idea because you're human and you

03:23:35.940 --> 03:23:39.860
think you're unique. Yeah, exactly. But also I can make a logical argument for it that even if

03:23:39.860 --> 03:23:44.340
we could copy, you know, all of your molecules and all their positions, the other, you would be there

03:23:44.340 --> 03:23:49.700
and you have a different position in space. You're distinguishable. Yeah. The other thing,

03:23:49.700 --> 03:23:55.140
how unique are you just by the position in space really? Sure. But then how much does that light

03:23:55.140 --> 03:24:01.460
translation of Lex sitting there affect the future? I see. But, but no, wait, wait a minute.

03:24:02.260 --> 03:24:06.980
It's part of the definition of something being interesting is how much it affects the future.

03:24:07.780 --> 03:24:12.180
Yes. Yes. But let me come back. Don't you agree? But let me come back. Do you disagree? One point

03:24:12.180 --> 03:24:16.420
simply that you were making. Sure. I think I probably agree. Yes. There's two Lexes, right?

03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:22.020
There's a robot Lex that you just basically, it's a, it's a, it is a charade. It's a facsimile.

03:24:22.580 --> 03:24:29.620
It's just coded to emulate you. Are you robot Lex? I wouldn't know.

03:24:31.540 --> 03:24:35.940
Very important point here because he's, he's ducking and diving between this eye. So,

03:24:35.940 --> 03:24:40.980
so if I facsimile you into a robot, then it would, you would, your robot might be,

03:24:41.700 --> 03:24:44.660
would be a representation of you now, but fundamentally be boring because you go and

03:24:44.660 --> 03:24:49.060
have other ideas. If however you built an architecture, there's itself as capable of

03:24:49.060 --> 03:24:53.460
generating novelty, you would diverge in your causal chain and you'd both be equally interesting

03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:57.220
to interact with. Yeah. We don't know that mechanism. All I'm trying to say is we don't

03:24:57.220 --> 03:25:01.540
yet know that mechanism. We do not know the mechanism that generates novelty. And at the

03:25:01.540 --> 03:25:08.580
moment in our AIs, we are emulating. We are not generating. You don't think we're sneaking up on

03:25:08.580 --> 03:25:14.500
that. Do you think there's a, no, no, there is no ghost in the machine. And I want there to be one.

03:25:15.060 --> 03:25:18.580
I want the same thing you want. Sorry. I was, I know you want that as a human because

03:25:19.220 --> 03:25:23.860
everything you just said makes you feel more special. I want to be, no, no, no, screw my

03:25:23.860 --> 03:25:29.300
specialness. I just want to be surprised if I think a robot can surprise you. If I, if you can

03:25:29.300 --> 03:25:35.380
produce an algorithm instantiated in a robot, surprise me. I will, I will, I will, I will,

03:25:35.380 --> 03:25:38.900
I will have one of those robots. It'd be brilliant, but they won't, it won't surprise me.

03:25:39.700 --> 03:25:43.220
But why, why is it a problem to think that humans are special?

03:25:44.260 --> 03:25:50.660
Maybe it's not the special. You're right. It's the better than. Yes. Because then you start to not

03:25:50.660 --> 03:25:56.100
recognize the magic in other life forms that you either have created or you have observed.

03:25:56.100 --> 03:26:03.300
Cause I just think there is magic in, uh, legged robots moving about and they are full of surprises.

03:26:03.300 --> 03:26:12.100
Yeah. So this is yeah. So I'm a little, uh, I know why you like cellular automata, right? But the,

03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:17.380
the specialness in your robot comes from the roboticist that built it.

03:26:17.380 --> 03:26:23.140
Yeah. It's part of the lineage. Yeah. And so that's fine. I'm happy with that.

03:26:23.140 --> 03:26:26.580
That's what I felt like looking at the standing robot was I was looking at 4 billion years of

03:26:26.580 --> 03:26:31.700
evolution. Yeah. Right. If it wasn't. So I think I'm happy. I mean, I'm happy we're going to co-exist.

03:26:31.700 --> 03:26:34.580
I'm just saying you're going to get more excitement. There's something missing in our

03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:39.860
understanding of intelligence. Intelligence isn't just training. Uh, the way the neural

03:26:39.860 --> 03:26:43.620
network is conceived right now is great and it's lovely and it'll be better and we will argue

03:26:43.620 --> 03:26:48.420
forever. But you want to know, wouldn't it be great if I said, look, I know how to invent an

03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:56.180
architecture and I can give it a soul. And what I mean by a soul is some, I know for real that

03:26:56.180 --> 03:27:02.020
there is internal reference. Soon as I not fake internal reference. And if we could generate that

03:27:02.020 --> 03:27:07.700
mechanism for internal reference, that's why our goal to direct, we can do that. Get that goal

03:27:07.700 --> 03:27:12.820
directedness. You would love that robot more than the one that's just made to look like it does

03:27:12.820 --> 03:27:17.700
because you'll have more fun with it because you better generate search other problems,

03:27:17.700 --> 03:27:21.300
get more novelty. Hell, you'd be able to fall in love with that robot for real,

03:27:21.300 --> 03:27:25.780
but not the one that's faking it. What about fake it till you make it?

03:27:26.500 --> 03:27:33.940
Well, I think a lot of people fall in love with, with, um, with, with fake humans. It's,

03:27:33.940 --> 03:27:38.580
it's nice to, it's nice to fall in love with something that's full of novelty. Yes.

03:27:38.580 --> 03:27:43.220
I, you know, I could imagine all kinds of robots that I would want to have a close relationship

03:27:43.220 --> 03:27:49.300
with. And I don't mean like sexual, I mean like intimacy, but I just don't think that, um,

03:27:51.060 --> 03:27:53.140
novelty generation is such a special.

03:27:56.020 --> 03:27:59.460
Okay. There's like mathematical novelty or something like that. And then there's just

03:27:59.460 --> 03:28:03.860
humans being surprised. And I think we're easily surprised. That's fine. But that's that,

03:28:03.940 --> 03:28:08.180
but you don't think that's a good definition. I'm happy to be surprised. Um,

03:28:09.700 --> 03:28:14.260
but not globally surprised cause someone else, but I really want, I was, why I'm a scientist.

03:28:14.260 --> 03:28:19.780
I really want to be the first to be surprised about something. And the first thing in the

03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:24.260
first in the universe to create that novelty and to know for sure that that novelty has never

03:28:24.260 --> 03:28:29.300
occurred anywhere else. That's a real buzz, right? That's our way to really know that I,

03:28:29.300 --> 03:28:33.220
you have to have a really big look up to him. Right. Yeah. You're never going to be no for

03:28:33.220 --> 03:28:37.620
sure. Right. That's, that's one of the hard things about being and scientists searching

03:28:37.620 --> 03:28:43.220
for this type of novelty. Maybe that's why mathematics mathematicians love discovery,

03:28:43.220 --> 03:28:48.740
but actually they are creating. And then when they create a new, um, uh, mathematical structure

03:28:48.740 --> 03:28:52.660
that they can then, they can, you can, you can write code to work out whether there's,

03:28:52.660 --> 03:28:56.420
whether that structure exists before that. That's almost why I would love to have been a

03:28:56.420 --> 03:29:02.020
mathematician from that regard to invent new math that really, I know pretty much for sure

03:29:02.020 --> 03:29:05.620
to not exist, does not exist anywhere else in the universe because so contingent.

03:29:05.620 --> 03:29:09.620
Right. But this gets into like you are, you said a few times that I still really don't understand

03:29:09.620 --> 03:29:14.020
how you actually plan to do this, to build an experiment that detects how the universe is

03:29:14.020 --> 03:29:19.220
generating novelty or that time is the mechanism. So the problem that we all have, which I think is

03:29:19.220 --> 03:29:24.660
what Lex is pushing against is if I build the experiment, you don't know what you put into it.

03:29:24.660 --> 03:29:29.540
So you don't know what, like if you, um, unless you can quantify everything you put in all of

03:29:29.540 --> 03:29:35.860
your agency, all the boundary conditions, you don't know if you somehow biased it in some way.

03:29:35.860 --> 03:29:39.380
So is the novelty actually intrinsic to that experiment or to that robot,

03:29:39.380 --> 03:29:43.380
or is it something you gave it, but you didn't realize it's going to be, it's going to asymptote

03:29:43.380 --> 03:29:47.140
towards that, right? You're never going to know for sure, but you can start to take out, you know,

03:29:47.140 --> 03:29:52.660
you can use good Bayesian approaches and just keep updating and updating and updating until

03:29:52.660 --> 03:29:58.020
you point to one. So you want to bound on how much novelty generation could be. Yeah. Got it.

03:29:58.900 --> 03:30:04.500
So the ability to generate novelty is correlated with high assembly index with assembly index.

03:30:04.500 --> 03:30:09.140
Yeah. And yeah. Cause the space of possibilities is bigger.

03:30:11.380 --> 03:30:18.340
So, um, that's the key. This could be a good, uh, so a running joke of like why Lex is single,

03:30:18.340 --> 03:30:26.260
this could be a good part four. Uh, so you, so what you're looking for in a robot partner

03:30:26.260 --> 03:30:36.020
is ability to generate novelty. And that's, I suppose you would say it's a good definition

03:30:36.100 --> 03:30:48.580
of intelligence too. Boys novelty, a, um, a fuzzy concept. Is creativity better?

03:30:49.940 --> 03:30:55.860
Yeah. I mean, that's all pretty fuzzy. It's kind of the same. Maybe that's why aliens haven't come

03:30:55.860 --> 03:31:00.100
yet is because we're not creating enough novelty. Like there's, there's some kind of a hierarchy of

03:31:00.100 --> 03:31:05.060
novelty in the universe. I think novelty is like things surprise you, right? So it's a very passive

03:31:05.060 --> 03:31:08.660
thing, but I guess I would remember by saying creativity is I think it's much more active.

03:31:08.660 --> 03:31:12.900
Like you think there's like a mechanism of like the things that exist are generating the

03:31:12.900 --> 03:31:16.740
creativity. Novelty seems to be, there's some spontaneous production. It has,

03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:20.580
it's completely decoupled from the things that exist. No, I, I understand. I think

03:31:21.860 --> 03:31:28.660
creativity is the mechanism and novelty is the observable. Yeah. Novelty could just be surprised

03:31:28.660 --> 03:31:34.020
your model of the world was broken and not necessarily in a positive way. That's the prize.

03:31:34.020 --> 03:31:37.220
So there's three things. Now let's go back. That's cool. Right. Let's go. You got surprise,

03:31:37.220 --> 03:31:41.380
which is basically, um, I don't, I mean, I'm surprised all the time because I don't read

03:31:41.380 --> 03:31:46.100
very much. I'm pretty dumb. I was like, Oh, wow. I often used to invent new scientific, you know,

03:31:46.100 --> 03:31:50.020
ideas and I was really surprised by that. And then when looking at literature properly and it's there.

03:31:50.020 --> 03:31:57.220
So surprise that's to the extent that you don't have full information, um, creativity, the act of

03:31:57.300 --> 03:32:04.660
pushing on that, um, kind of on the causal structure and novelty, which is measuring that

03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:10.420
degree. Right. So I think that's pretty well defined in that regard. So you want your robot,

03:32:10.420 --> 03:32:14.740
I mean, in the, and in the end, that's why actually the way the internet and the printing press share

03:32:15.540 --> 03:32:20.020
some, um, I actually think creativity has dropped a bit since the creator, since the internet,

03:32:20.020 --> 03:32:24.340
because everyone's just, just, you know, just regurgitating stuff. But of course now it's

03:32:24.340 --> 03:32:28.100
beginning to accelerate again because everyone is using this tool to be creative

03:32:28.740 --> 03:32:33.460
and boom is exploding. I think that's what happens when you create these new technologies.

03:32:34.580 --> 03:32:38.580
That's really, that's really helpful. There's a difference between novelty and surprise. Okay.

03:32:38.580 --> 03:32:42.980
I was, I think I was thinking about surprise. If you give me a toy that surprises me for a bit,

03:32:42.980 --> 03:32:47.140
it'd be great. Robot surprises me, you know, experiment that surprises you. Yeah. I mean,

03:32:47.140 --> 03:32:51.940
that's why I love doing experiments because I'm, I can't, it's still exciting. Surprise is exciting.

03:32:52.900 --> 03:32:58.980
Even negative surprise. Like some people love drama and relationships. Like it's like, why the

03:32:58.980 --> 03:33:04.660
hell? Why'd you do this? That can be exciting. I can imagine companies selling updates to their,

03:33:04.660 --> 03:33:08.580
their companion robots that just basically generate negative surprise. Just to,

03:33:08.580 --> 03:33:13.300
just spice things up a bit. Yeah. It's the push and pull. That's, that's one of the components

03:33:13.300 --> 03:33:18.260
of love. As you said, love is a complicated thing. Oh, beauty. I wanted to mention this

03:33:18.340 --> 03:33:22.900
because you also tweeted, I think this was Sarah. No, it might've been Lee. I don't remember,

03:33:22.900 --> 03:33:29.540
but it was a survey published in nature showing that scientists find, yeah. Anyway, there's a,

03:33:29.540 --> 03:33:36.740
there's a plot published in nature of what scientists find beautiful in their work and

03:33:36.740 --> 03:33:42.020
it separates biologists and physicists. It'd be nice if you showed the full plot and there's

03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:48.260
simplicity, elegance, hidden order, inner logic of systems, symmetry, complexity, harmony,

03:33:48.260 --> 03:33:54.820
and so on. Is there any interesting things that stand out to you? I think the fact that biologists

03:33:54.820 --> 03:34:02.580
like complexity and pleasing colors. Oh, there's pleasing colors on there. Yeah. Yeah. Or shapes,

03:34:02.580 --> 03:34:08.180
pleasing colors. And then physicists obviously love simplicity above all else. Simplicity,

03:34:08.180 --> 03:34:14.900
elegance. Yeah. They love symmetry and then biologists love complexity and,

03:34:15.620 --> 03:34:19.300
well, they just love a little bit less. They love everything a little bit less,

03:34:19.300 --> 03:34:23.940
but complexity a little bit more. A little bit more. That's so interesting. And pleasing colors

03:34:23.940 --> 03:34:28.580
or shapes. Do you think it's a useful, I forget what your tweet was that this is missing some of

03:34:28.580 --> 03:34:36.580
the- Oh, no, I think I, it's because I think about how explanations become causal to our future. So

03:34:37.460 --> 03:34:45.940
I have this whole philosophy that the theories we build and the way we describe reality should have

03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:53.700
the largest breadth of possibilities for the future of what we can accomplish. So in some sense,

03:34:53.700 --> 03:34:59.060
it's not like Occam's razor is not for simplicity, it's for optimism or the kind of future you can

03:34:59.060 --> 03:35:05.620
build. And so I think you have to think this way when you're thinking about life and alien life,

03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:09.620
because ultimately we're trying to build, I mean, science is just basically our narratives

03:35:09.620 --> 03:35:14.340
about reality. And now you're building a narrative that is what we are as physical systems. It seems

03:35:14.340 --> 03:35:18.500
to me it needs to be as positive as possible because it's basically going to shape the future

03:35:18.500 --> 03:35:22.660
trajectory where we're going. And we don't use that as a heuristic in theory building because we

03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:29.220
think theories are about predicting features of the world, not causing them. But if you look at

03:35:29.220 --> 03:35:32.900
the history of all of the development of human thought, it's caused the things that happen next.

03:35:32.900 --> 03:35:39.140
So it's not just about looking at the world and observing it, it's about actually that feedback

03:35:39.140 --> 03:35:49.540
loop that's missing and it's not in any of those categories. What do you think is the most beautiful

03:35:49.540 --> 03:35:57.220
idea in the physics of life, in the chemistry of life, in this, through all your exploration

03:35:57.220 --> 03:36:08.580
with assembly theory, what is the thing that made you step back and say this idea is beautiful

03:36:09.140 --> 03:36:16.420
or potentially beautiful? For me, it's that the universe is a creative place. I guess I want to

03:36:16.420 --> 03:36:22.500
think, and whether it's true or not, is that we are special in some way and it's not like an arbitrary

03:36:23.380 --> 03:36:27.540
added-on epiphenomenon or ad hoc feature of the universe that we exist, but it's something

03:36:27.540 --> 03:36:32.580
deep and intrinsic to the structure of reality. And to me, the most beautiful ideas that come

03:36:32.580 --> 03:36:39.620
out of that is that the reason we exist is for the universe to generate more things and to think

03:36:39.620 --> 03:36:47.540
about itself and use that as a mechanism for creating more stuff. That's for me.

03:36:48.500 --> 03:36:54.980
So the life, however common it is, is an intrinsic part,

03:36:55.780 --> 03:36:59.780
is a fundamental part of this universe at least that we live in.

03:36:59.780 --> 03:37:06.340
I think so. It's always interesting to me because we have theories of quantum mechanics and gravity

03:37:06.340 --> 03:37:11.220
and they're supposed to be our most fundamental theories right now and they describe things like

03:37:11.220 --> 03:37:16.580
the interaction of massive bodies or the way that charges accelerate or all these kind of features.

03:37:17.220 --> 03:37:21.140
And they're these really deep theories and they tell us a lot about how reality works,

03:37:21.140 --> 03:37:25.620
but they're completely agnostic to our existence. And I can't help but think that

03:37:25.620 --> 03:37:32.500
whatever describes us has to be even deeper than that. And I think incorporating memory,

03:37:32.500 --> 03:37:38.500
I guess, causality, whatever the term you want to use into the physics view of the world might be.

03:37:38.500 --> 03:37:43.140
That's the easiest way to do it. It's the cleanest. So here we go again with the physicists,

03:37:43.140 --> 03:37:48.020
I'm a physicist. I was going to say the simplest, most elegant way of resolving all of the kind of

03:37:48.020 --> 03:37:58.420
ways that we have these paradoxes associated with life. Current physics is not incompatible

03:37:58.420 --> 03:38:04.100
with life, but it doesn't explain life. And then you want to know where are the explanatory gaps.

03:38:04.100 --> 03:38:10.020
And this idea that we have an assembly, that time is fundamental and objects actually are

03:38:10.020 --> 03:38:14.740
extended in time and have physical extent in time is the cleanest way of resolving a lot of the

03:38:14.740 --> 03:38:21.620
explanatory gaps. So I've been, I struggle with assembly theory for many years because I could

03:38:21.620 --> 03:38:30.900
see this gap. And I think when I first met Sarah and we realized we were kind of talking about the

03:38:30.900 --> 03:38:35.780
same problem, but we understood none of the language. It was quite hilarious actually,

03:38:35.780 --> 03:38:39.460
because it's like, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I think it sounds right.

03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:43.380
So for me, the most beautiful thing about assembly theory is I realized

03:38:43.940 --> 03:38:48.900
the assembly theory explains why life is the universe developing a memory,

03:38:48.900 --> 03:38:53.860
but not only that poetically, I could actually go and measure it. And I was like,

03:38:54.900 --> 03:39:00.980
holy shit, we physically measured this thing, this abstract thing, and we could measure it.

03:39:01.700 --> 03:39:06.500
And not only could we measure it, but we can then start to quantify the causal consequences.

03:39:08.340 --> 03:39:14.740
Because, I mean, I think as a kind of inventing this together with Sarah and her team,

03:39:16.820 --> 03:39:22.100
I thought there was quite a high chance that we're doing science, there's such a high probability

03:39:22.100 --> 03:39:27.220
we're wrong, you know, on this. And I remember kind of trying to go to

03:39:28.740 --> 03:39:36.100
hard physicists, mathematicians, complexity theorists, and everyone just kind of giving

03:39:36.100 --> 03:39:40.740
me such a hard time about it. And so, you know, this is kind of, this is, you've just done this,

03:39:40.740 --> 03:39:44.580
you've just done that, it's, you know, you've just recapitulated an old theory.

03:39:45.460 --> 03:39:51.540
And I was unable, I lacked the language to really explain. And I had to, it was a real struggle.

03:39:52.100 --> 03:39:58.740
So this realization that life, what life does, that physics cannot understand, or chemistry,

03:39:58.740 --> 03:40:04.980
is the universe develops a memory that's causally actionable. And then we can measure it. But it

03:40:04.980 --> 03:40:10.020
isn't just one thing, there is this intrinsic property of all the objects in the universe.

03:40:10.020 --> 03:40:14.180
Like I've said before, but, you know, me holding up this water bottle, it isn't any other water

03:40:14.180 --> 03:40:20.260
bottle, but it is a sum total of all the water bottles that have existed, right? And will likely

03:40:20.260 --> 03:40:25.620
change the future of water bottles and for other objects. So it's this kind of, so for me,

03:40:26.500 --> 03:40:34.660
assembly theory explains the soul in stuff. The monology. But it is monology. It's not like

03:40:34.660 --> 03:40:38.740
Sheldra exmorphic resonance, where we have this kind of wooey thing permeating the universe.

03:40:39.540 --> 03:40:44.820
It is the interaction of objects of other objects. And some objects have more instantaneous

03:40:44.900 --> 03:40:52.900
causal power, that's life, living things. And some objects are the instantaneous output of

03:40:52.900 --> 03:40:57.700
that causal power, dead objects, but they are part of the lineage. And that for me is fascinating and

03:40:57.700 --> 03:41:03.620
really beautiful. And I think that even if we're determined to be totally wrong, I think it will

03:41:03.620 --> 03:41:09.300
help us help hopefully understand what life is and go into tech life elsewhere and make life in the

03:41:09.300 --> 03:41:14.100
lab. How does that make you feel, by the way? Does it make you feel less special that you're

03:41:14.100 --> 03:41:19.220
so deeply integrated, interconnected to the lineage? I mean, I can on one level,

03:41:19.220 --> 03:41:23.460
I just wanted in my life as a scientist, I wanted to have an interesting idea just once

03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:30.340
or an original idea. I mean, it was like, you know, so I think that was cool that we had this

03:41:30.340 --> 03:41:35.540
idea and we were playing with it. And I think also that I kind of, I mean, it took me ages to

03:41:35.540 --> 03:41:40.180
realize that Sarah had also had the same kind of form is coming towards the same formulation,

03:41:40.180 --> 03:41:45.860
just from a completely different point. But no, it makes me feel special. And it also makes me

03:41:45.860 --> 03:41:52.580
feel connected to the universe. It also makes me feel not just humble about being a living object

03:41:52.580 --> 03:41:56.420
in the universe, but the fact that it makes me really optimistic about what the universe is

03:41:56.420 --> 03:42:02.660
going to do in the future, because we're not just isolated phenomena, we are connected.

03:42:02.660 --> 03:42:08.020
I will be able to have, you know, one of my small objectives in life is to change the future of the

03:42:08.020 --> 03:42:13.780
universe in some profound way just by existing. Yeah, that's not ambitious at all.

03:42:19.060 --> 03:42:23.140
I think it's also good because it makes me feel less lonely, because I just realize I'm not like,

03:42:23.140 --> 03:42:26.500
I mean, I'm a unique assembly structure, but I have so much overlap with the other

03:42:26.500 --> 03:42:31.380
entities I interact with that we're not completely individual, right?

03:42:31.380 --> 03:42:39.700
And yet, your existence does have a huge amount of impact on how this whole thing unrolls

03:42:39.700 --> 03:42:45.700
on the future of the world. As individuals, yeah. Local packets of agency.

03:42:45.700 --> 03:42:49.860
I think we all have a profound impact on the future, some more than others, right? All human

03:42:49.860 --> 03:42:56.660
beings, all life. And I mean, that's why I think it's a privilege in a way to assert some degree

03:42:56.660 --> 03:43:01.620
of ego and agency. You know, I'm going to make a computer or make an origin life machine or

03:43:01.620 --> 03:43:05.220
you can do this thing. But actually, it's just like, you know, life's probably living,

03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:09.700
if there is a God or there's a soul in everything, it's probably laughing at us going,

03:43:10.340 --> 03:43:15.060
I fool these guys by giving them ego. So they strive for this stuff and look what it does for,

03:43:15.060 --> 03:43:19.300
you know, the assembly space of the universe. And there's always a possibility that science

03:43:19.300 --> 03:43:25.140
can't answer all of it. So that part's challenging for me. There might be a limit to this thing.

03:43:26.900 --> 03:43:33.140
Let me ask you a bunch of ridiculous questions and I demand relatively short answers.

03:43:34.100 --> 03:43:36.100
Lee, what's the scariest thing you've ever done?

03:43:40.900 --> 03:43:47.220
Or what's the scary thing that pops to mind? Giving lectures, giving seminars in front of

03:43:47.220 --> 03:43:54.900
other scientists. Yeah, that is terrifying. I could, if I had more time, I would ask you

03:43:54.900 --> 03:43:59.540
about the most embarrassing, but we'll spare you. What about you, Sarah? Scariest thing?

03:44:01.460 --> 03:44:04.020
Up there, some of the scary things you've done.

03:44:05.860 --> 03:44:09.780
Actually, the scariest for me was deciding I wanted to get divorced because it was like a

03:44:09.780 --> 03:44:12.740
totally radical like- Life transformation.

03:44:12.740 --> 03:44:17.460
Yeah, because we had been married for a really long time. And I think it was just so much like,

03:44:18.180 --> 03:44:22.740
I realized like so much of my individual agency, I didn't realize I had before. And that was just

03:44:22.740 --> 03:44:28.340
really like scary, like empowering scary, but like terrifying. We're living in a kind of one

03:44:28.340 --> 03:44:30.740
way for your whole life and then you realize your life could be a different way.

03:44:32.180 --> 03:44:37.780
Yeah, there is a between humans. I mean, that's the beautiful thing about love is the connection

03:44:37.780 --> 03:44:41.940
you have, but it's also becomes a dependency and breaking that. Whether it's a mentor,

03:44:41.940 --> 03:44:45.140
whether it's your parents, your close friends. It's almost like waking up,

03:44:45.140 --> 03:44:47.940
like just there's a different reality. Yeah, that was scary.

03:44:48.020 --> 03:44:54.420
Reinventing yourself. Okay, if you could, Lee, maybe I'll actually alternate. Sarah,

03:44:54.420 --> 03:45:01.140
if you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, you haven't met yet. Or maybe you

03:45:01.140 --> 03:45:08.260
could do one who you've met. Who would it be? Kim Kardashian. No joke. The woman's brilliant.

03:45:10.340 --> 03:45:16.500
I think she's got such an interesting and very deep understanding of social reality.

03:45:16.500 --> 03:45:20.180
But you also said you have an appreciation, a love for fashion.

03:45:20.180 --> 03:45:25.060
I do. But that's actually the same. I just think it's really interesting because we live in a social

03:45:25.060 --> 03:45:29.220
reality which is completely artificially constructed. And some people are really genius

03:45:29.220 --> 03:45:32.180
about moving through that. And I think she's particularly good at it. I wonder if she's good

03:45:32.180 --> 03:45:36.180
at understanding or if she's- I think it's very deeply intrinsic to her. So I don't know if she

03:45:36.180 --> 03:45:40.340
has- She's like surfing a wave. How much cognitive awareness she has of it or how strategic it is.

03:45:40.340 --> 03:45:43.540
But I think it's deeply fascinating. So I guess that's the first one that comes to mind.

03:45:44.500 --> 03:45:48.660
What about you, Lee? If you could be somebody for a day. Don't say Yoshua Bach.

03:45:49.620 --> 03:45:53.780
Don't say Kim Kardashian. Let's do off the table. Off the table.

03:45:53.780 --> 03:45:58.820
No, I was going to say I would like to be a- Does it have to be here today? I was going to say

03:45:58.820 --> 03:46:08.020
I'd like to be the latest arm processor. I would like to be the latest arm processor. I'd like to

03:46:08.020 --> 03:46:11.860
understand. I would like to know what it'd feel like to basically-

03:46:13.940 --> 03:46:14.980
You like being objects.

03:46:14.980 --> 03:46:18.340
I like being- I've always obsessed with being objects ever since I was a kid.

03:46:18.340 --> 03:46:20.980
What's the best part of being an arm processor for a day?

03:46:20.980 --> 03:46:23.300
I mean, I'd like to understand how I access my memory,

03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:25.780
what it anticipates coming next in clock cycles.

03:46:25.780 --> 03:46:27.460
What about how it feels like?

03:46:27.460 --> 03:46:30.100
Yeah. I wonder how it feels like to be-

03:46:30.100 --> 03:46:30.740
To be useful.

03:46:32.900 --> 03:46:33.540
Thanks for that.

03:46:33.780 --> 03:46:43.860
All right. If, Lee, if everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,

03:46:43.860 --> 03:46:47.860
what would your days look like? What would you do? Nobody else left on press.

03:46:49.780 --> 03:46:55.300
Probably can't really do any real science at scale. What would you do? What would your remaining-

03:46:55.300 --> 03:47:00.980
Get every possible tool I could and put it in my workshop and just make stuff.

03:47:01.940 --> 03:47:03.940
As, so try to make stuff.

03:47:03.940 --> 03:47:07.620
Just try and make stuff. Make companions. Probably not making companions. Probably, yeah.

03:47:08.820 --> 03:47:09.780
In the physical space?

03:47:09.780 --> 03:47:10.020
Yeah.

03:47:11.220 --> 03:47:14.580
What about you, Sarah? What would you, when you're just left alone on earth,

03:47:15.300 --> 03:47:17.860
Are there animals in this scenario?

03:47:17.860 --> 03:47:19.220
No living beings.

03:47:19.220 --> 03:47:19.860
No plants?

03:47:20.980 --> 03:47:21.620
No plants.

03:47:23.140 --> 03:47:25.060
Oh, interesting. I was going to say I would just,

03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:28.100
I would try to walk the entire planet, at least all the landmass.

03:47:28.740 --> 03:47:34.260
Well, that's, that's true. So you probably don't know if there's stuff. You could be,

03:47:34.260 --> 03:47:36.340
you could be searching for plants or other humans.

03:47:36.340 --> 03:47:37.220
And what would I eat?

03:47:39.540 --> 03:47:44.660
It's a, you just have daily, just allotment.

03:47:44.660 --> 03:47:45.780
I would just walk all the time.

03:47:45.780 --> 03:47:46.740
Of soylent.

03:47:46.740 --> 03:47:47.700
I don't know why I-

03:47:47.700 --> 03:47:48.420
Just walk.

03:47:48.420 --> 03:47:49.460
That's just what came to mind.

03:47:49.460 --> 03:47:49.860
You're the explorer.

03:47:49.860 --> 03:47:54.580
I would just walk. And I guess I would make a goal of covering all of the entire earth

03:47:54.580 --> 03:47:56.260
because what else are you going to do with your time?

03:47:56.260 --> 03:48:00.740
What's an item on your bucket list, Sarah, that you haven't done yet, but you hope to do?

03:48:02.660 --> 03:48:04.980
Skydiving. Travel to space.

03:48:08.340 --> 03:48:11.540
I don't know. You know what's funny with my bucket list?

03:48:11.540 --> 03:48:14.100
I only know it was on my bucket list once I check it off.

03:48:14.100 --> 03:48:17.940
Once you check it off. So your bucket list is like a fog. It's like a mystery.

03:48:17.940 --> 03:48:18.260
Yeah.

03:48:18.260 --> 03:48:19.940
You almost by doing it.

03:48:19.940 --> 03:48:21.940
Yeah. So it's very subconsciously driven.

03:48:22.580 --> 03:48:24.500
So it's in your subconscious in there.

03:48:24.500 --> 03:48:25.060
I think so.

03:48:25.060 --> 03:48:26.340
You're bringing it to the surface.

03:48:26.340 --> 03:48:28.980
I think most of the steering of our agencies in our subconscious anyway.

03:48:28.980 --> 03:48:32.740
So I just kind of go with the flow, but I guess, no, seriously.

03:48:33.300 --> 03:48:34.100
Yeah, no, I get it.

03:48:34.980 --> 03:48:37.860
I don't know. I guess, but I would like to go in a submarine, like to the bottom of the ocean.

03:48:37.860 --> 03:48:38.820
I think that'd be really cool.

03:48:38.820 --> 03:48:42.260
To the bottom of the ocean. Are you captivated by the mystery of the ocean?

03:48:42.820 --> 03:48:43.780
I am. Yeah.

03:48:45.380 --> 03:48:49.380
Yeah. What about you, Lee? What item on your bucket list?

03:48:50.260 --> 03:48:53.460
I don't have a bucket list, but I've just made one. I would love to take a computer

03:48:53.540 --> 03:48:59.620
to the moon or Mars and make drugs off world. Be the first chemist to make drugs off world.

03:49:00.580 --> 03:49:02.420
The first drug manufacturer in space.

03:49:02.420 --> 03:49:03.140
Yeah. Why not?

03:49:03.860 --> 03:49:10.420
Do they have to be somehow like be able to be able to survive on that particular space?

03:49:10.420 --> 03:49:14.180
Or like, what's the connection between being on Mars and doing manufacturing?

03:49:14.180 --> 03:49:20.100
I just would like to take the ability to have command and control over chemicals

03:49:20.900 --> 03:49:23.140
programmatically off earth to somewhere else.

03:49:23.940 --> 03:49:27.540
That just seems like you like difficulty engineering problems.

03:49:28.580 --> 03:49:29.780
Before I die, if I can do that.

03:49:29.780 --> 03:49:31.220
Would you travel to space before?

03:49:31.220 --> 03:49:35.700
Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. I'd love to go into space, but not just to be a tourist.

03:49:35.700 --> 03:49:40.420
I want to take science experiment in space and do a thing in space that had never been done before.

03:49:41.220 --> 03:49:42.820
That's a real possibility.

03:49:42.820 --> 03:49:47.140
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why there's no point in listing things I can't do.

03:49:48.900 --> 03:49:53.300
All right. What small act of kindness were you once shown

03:49:53.540 --> 03:49:54.580
that you will never forget?

03:49:56.260 --> 03:50:00.980
Small act of kindness, not big. Somebody was just kind to you.

03:50:00.980 --> 03:50:02.420
Somebody did something sweet.

03:50:03.220 --> 03:50:13.300
When I was a PhD student, someone helped me out with just, I was basically, I needed a computer.

03:50:13.300 --> 03:50:15.300
I needed some power, computation power.

03:50:15.300 --> 03:50:18.900
And someone took pity on me and helped me and gave me, I was really touched.

03:50:18.900 --> 03:50:22.900
They didn't have to. And they're actually quite, they're disabled scientists.

03:50:23.140 --> 03:50:26.180
I've had other things to do rather than help some random PhD student.

03:50:26.180 --> 03:50:28.340
Gave me access, taught me a lot of stuff.

03:50:28.980 --> 03:50:32.660
Yeah. Actually, when you're a grad student or when you're a student, when you're even a student,

03:50:33.220 --> 03:50:40.020
the younger it is, the better. The attention, the support, the love you get from an older person,

03:50:40.020 --> 03:50:43.460
a teacher, something like that is super powerful. It's fascinating.

03:50:43.460 --> 03:50:47.460
And from the perspective of the teacher, they might not realize the impact they have,

03:50:47.460 --> 03:50:54.420
but that little bit, those few words, a little bit of help can have a lot of impact.

03:50:54.420 --> 03:50:59.220
What about you, Sarah? Somebody give you a free Starbucks at some point.

03:50:59.220 --> 03:51:03.780
I love free Starbucks. I like it when you're like in the line at Starbucks and somebody

03:51:03.780 --> 03:51:06.180
buys your coffee in front of you and then you buy the next one. I love those.

03:51:07.060 --> 03:51:10.100
That's not my example. Those are great. It makes me happy.

03:51:10.100 --> 03:51:12.500
And now my kids get all excited when we do it, when we go in.

03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:13.860
We're the first ones in line doing it.

03:51:17.940 --> 03:51:25.220
I guess I can use a similar example about just being a student. So Paul Davies is a very well

03:51:25.220 --> 03:51:32.180
known theoretical physicist and he was generous enough with his time to take me on as a postdoc.

03:51:32.820 --> 03:51:36.820
But before I became his postdoc, he invited me to a workshop at Arizona State University and

03:51:36.820 --> 03:51:42.580
the Beyond Center and took a walk with me around campus just to talk about ideas after. And I think

03:51:43.220 --> 03:51:50.260
there were two things that were completely generous about that. One is Paul's philosophy

03:51:50.260 --> 03:51:54.980
is always interacting with young people. It's like you interact with a mind in the room. It

03:51:54.980 --> 03:51:59.700
doesn't matter how well known or whatever. It's like you evaluate the person for the person.

03:52:00.900 --> 03:52:04.980
But he also gave me a book, The Eerie Silence, that he had written and he wrote in it.

03:52:05.620 --> 03:52:12.500
This is How EE Gets to ET, which was An Antimeric Excess, which I worked on as a PhD student. It was

03:52:12.500 --> 03:52:16.420
the origin of homo chirality all the way up to what the book was about, which was Are We Alone

03:52:16.420 --> 03:52:23.620
in the Universe and Is There Intelligent Life Out There? And it was just so much about the questions

03:52:23.620 --> 03:52:28.980
I wanted to ask because it was just everything about, it was just really, really kind.

03:52:29.700 --> 03:52:34.260
Like that it's okay to ask these questions and you can actually have strong enough to answer them.

03:52:34.260 --> 03:52:38.500
Yeah, I think a lot of my career is mostly his encouragement to ask deep questions. He gave me

03:52:38.500 --> 03:52:43.300
the space to do it in ways that a lot of previous mentors had. I've had a good experience with

03:52:43.300 --> 03:52:48.340
mentors, but it was like go off the deep end, ask the hardest questions. And I think that's

03:52:48.340 --> 03:52:53.140
the best gift you can give somebody. What would you, because you're both fascinating minds and

03:52:53.140 --> 03:53:01.380
not, I would say, non-standard in the best possible way. Is there advice you can give

03:53:01.380 --> 03:53:06.980
to young folks how to be non-standard, how to stand out, novelty, how to generate novelty?

03:53:06.980 --> 03:53:12.420
That's what I want on my tombstone, I have one. He generated novelty.

03:53:12.420 --> 03:53:13.940
No, no, how to. How to.

03:53:14.900 --> 03:53:23.060
How still? I just love doing science. And so when I was younger, I was just wanted to, I mean,

03:53:23.060 --> 03:53:28.020
I'm still not sure I'm a real scientist, right? So I want to try. So my advice for the young people

03:53:28.020 --> 03:53:34.660
is just, if you love asking questions, then don't be afraid to ask the question, even if it pisses

03:53:34.660 --> 03:53:39.060
people off. Because if you piss people off, you're probably asking the right question.

03:53:39.860 --> 03:53:45.300
What I would say though is don't do what I did, which is just piss everyone off. Try and work out

03:53:45.300 --> 03:53:53.220
how to, you know, I think if other people are challenged by your questions, you will get

03:53:54.180 --> 03:54:00.340
not only respect, but people will create space for you because you're doing something really new.

03:54:01.300 --> 03:54:07.860
I really try to create space in my academic career with my team, really try and praise them

03:54:07.860 --> 03:54:15.460
and push them to do new things. So my advice is try to do new things, get feedback, and the universe

03:54:15.460 --> 03:54:22.500
will help you. Because the universe likes novelty. I think so. I think so, right? This one will keep

03:54:22.500 --> 03:54:29.860
them around. What about you, Sarah? You too like to ask the really out there big questions.

03:54:29.860 --> 03:54:37.140
Yeah, because I have a strong passion for them. So I think it goes back to the love. If you're

03:54:37.140 --> 03:54:41.220
doing the thing you're supposed to be doing, you should really love it. So I always tell people

03:54:41.220 --> 03:54:44.660
that they should do the thing they're most passionate about. But I think a flip side of that

03:54:44.660 --> 03:54:50.900
is that's when you become, in some way, not to sound cheesy, but your best version of yourself.

03:54:50.900 --> 03:54:56.100
So I guess for me, as I become more successful in my career, I feel like I can be more myself

03:54:56.100 --> 03:55:00.660
as an individual. And so there's this, I've always been following the questions I'm most interested

03:55:00.660 --> 03:55:05.380
in, which very early on I was discouraged from knowing by many people because they thought they

03:55:05.380 --> 03:55:10.260
were unanswerable questions. And I always just thought, well, if no one's even trying to answer

03:55:10.260 --> 03:55:13.860
them, of course they're going to be unanswerable. And then that was kind of an odd viewpoint. But

03:55:13.860 --> 03:55:19.860
the more I found my way in that space, the more I also made a space for myself as a person,

03:55:19.860 --> 03:55:24.100
because you're basically generating the niche that you want to exist in.

03:55:25.140 --> 03:55:31.700
And so I think that's part of it is not just to follow your passion, but also think about

03:55:31.700 --> 03:55:38.580
who do you want to be and create that. Yeah. Who am I? Who do you want to be? I mean,

03:55:38.580 --> 03:55:43.620
play temporally with it. Yeah. Who am I now? Who do I want to be now? But who do I want to be in

03:55:43.620 --> 03:55:49.460
the future? They're not decoupled. Yeah. I always wonder if that's like, if I become something,

03:55:50.820 --> 03:55:56.980
am I finding myself or am I creating myself? Yeah. And I think those are somehow the same

03:55:56.980 --> 03:56:02.420
kind of thing. I do feel often like I was always meant to be this kind of thing. Yeah. But

03:56:04.260 --> 03:56:08.660
is that created or discovered? I don't know. But basically go towards that direction.

03:56:09.380 --> 03:56:15.060
If you were abducted by aliens, Sarah. Excellent. I'm waiting. They can come find me.

03:56:15.140 --> 03:56:20.500
They're on a spaceship. And then they somehow figured out the language you speak

03:56:22.420 --> 03:56:30.980
and ask you, what are you? Explain yourself. Not you, Sarah, but the species.

03:56:32.500 --> 03:56:40.980
What's life on earth? Like we don't have time or busy grad students from another planet.

03:56:41.780 --> 03:56:48.500
What's interesting about human civilization? What's interesting about you? You specifically,

03:56:48.500 --> 03:56:57.780
too. They could be very kind of personal, kind of pushy. And yeah. How would you describe?

03:56:57.780 --> 03:57:04.500
Okay. I have one. Because obviously I self-identify as a scientist and a physicist,

03:57:04.500 --> 03:57:08.020
but intrinsically I feel more like an artist. But it's almost like you're an artist that you

03:57:08.020 --> 03:57:13.780
don't know what you're painting yet. And I guess I feel like that's humanity. In some sense,

03:57:14.580 --> 03:57:20.420
we're creating something I think is profound and potentially very beautiful in existence in the

03:57:20.420 --> 03:57:26.740
universe. But we're just so naive. Not naive. We're just early. We're early. We're young.

03:57:26.740 --> 03:57:30.020
We don't know what we're doing yet. Yeah. What's with the nuclear weapons?

03:57:30.020 --> 03:57:33.460
There's a big question, too. What are you guys? What are we doing with them?

03:57:34.180 --> 03:57:37.700
This creativity that you talk about sounds very nice, but you're...

03:57:37.700 --> 03:57:38.980
We're making things that are...

03:57:38.980 --> 03:57:42.980
Like very destructive and like the rockets. This seems very aggressive.

03:57:43.620 --> 03:57:50.420
Yeah. I know. This is my blinders on. I don't know. I mean, it goes back to the whole conversation

03:57:50.420 --> 03:57:55.300
about suffering. I have a hard time regularizing certain aspects of reality into what I want to

03:57:55.860 --> 03:58:01.300
envision. And that's obviously problematic. But nuclear power has also given us a lot of

03:58:01.300 --> 03:58:09.140
good things. That's human nature. Both human beings and the technology we create has the

03:58:09.140 --> 03:58:12.740
capacity for evil and the capacity for good. Yeah. We can't all be good all the time. I mean,

03:58:12.740 --> 03:58:17.940
there's this huge misnomer that you need to be liked by everyone universally. And obviously,

03:58:17.940 --> 03:58:23.060
that's an ideal, but it's physically impossible. You can't get a group of people in a room and

03:58:23.060 --> 03:58:27.940
have everyone like each other all the time. So I think that kind of tension is actually really

03:58:27.940 --> 03:58:37.860
important that we have different aesthetics, different goals, and sometimes conflict comes

03:58:37.860 --> 03:58:43.540
out of that. Yeah. Speaking of which, do you and Josje Bach ever say anything nice to each other

03:58:43.540 --> 03:58:48.260
or is it always conflict? We never have conflict. We argue, but I don't think they

03:58:48.260 --> 03:58:53.380
argue arguments are bad. I mean, I think the problem I have... Not problem, I think...

03:58:53.380 --> 03:58:58.180
Here we go. And he's not here to defend himself. No, it's just I don't necessarily understand

03:58:59.780 --> 03:59:07.220
he's just talking at such a high level. I'm a dimwit. So I think a lot of our conflict,

03:59:07.220 --> 03:59:13.380
it's not conflict. I can't speak for Jascha. I have a deep appreciation for him. He's brilliant.

03:59:13.380 --> 03:59:20.660
But I think I'm kind of frustrated in that I'm trying to... He thinks the universe is a computer

03:59:20.660 --> 03:59:26.900
and I want to turn the universe into a computer. Yeah. That's a small disagreement. So how would

03:59:26.900 --> 03:59:31.780
you defend your life to an alien when you're being abducted? Would you focus on the specifics

03:59:31.780 --> 03:59:36.900
of your life? No, no, no. I would try and be as random as possible or try and confuse them.

03:59:36.900 --> 03:59:46.580
Oh, good. Good. Excellent. That might be the wiser choice. The Easter eggs in reality. No,

03:59:46.580 --> 03:59:50.900
I mean, if the aliens abducted me, I would try and be as random as possible. I would try and

03:59:50.900 --> 03:59:54.260
do something that would surprise the hell out of them, which I thought... I mean, it's probably

03:59:54.260 --> 03:59:58.900
quite risky. They might kill me, but I think that might be funny. Yeah, they might want to

03:59:58.900 --> 04:00:02.580
study you for prolonged periods of time. My reasoning is if I wanted to stay alive,

04:00:02.580 --> 04:00:06.500
okay, so if the thing is, if I wasn't going back to Earth and the job was to stay alive,

04:00:06.500 --> 04:00:09.540
if I could be as surprising as possible, they'd keep me around like a pet, right?

04:00:10.180 --> 04:00:12.740
Petly on the aliens.

04:00:12.740 --> 04:00:14.580
So you'd be okay being a pet?

04:00:14.580 --> 04:00:15.140
Well, no, but I mean...

04:00:15.140 --> 04:00:19.380
The last human that survives would just be a pet to the aliens.

04:00:19.380 --> 04:00:24.900
I don't know, but I mean, I think that might be fun because then I might get some feedback

04:00:24.900 --> 04:00:26.580
from their curiosity, but yeah.

04:00:26.580 --> 04:00:30.660
Let me ask you this question. Given our conversation has a very different meaning,

04:00:31.220 --> 04:00:37.220
not a more profound need perhaps, but would you rather lose all of your old memories or

04:00:37.300 --> 04:00:38.980
never be able to make new ones?

04:00:42.100 --> 04:00:46.420
I would have to lose all my old memories.

04:00:47.460 --> 04:00:52.180
Again, it's the novelty. What about you, Sarah?

04:00:52.180 --> 04:00:57.060
I'm the same because I don't think... It's about the future experience, right? And in some sense,

04:00:57.700 --> 04:01:01.700
like you were saying earlier, most of our lived experience is actually in our memories,

04:01:01.700 --> 04:01:05.380
so if you can't generate new memories, it's like you're not alive anymore.

04:01:06.260 --> 04:01:07.220
That's it, yeah.

04:01:07.940 --> 04:01:13.300
What comforts you on bad days when you look at human civilization, when you look at your own life?

04:01:13.940 --> 04:01:19.620
What gives you hope? What makes you feel good about what we're doing, about life at the

04:01:19.620 --> 04:01:24.340
small scale of you as a human and at the big scale of us as a human civilization,

04:01:24.340 --> 04:01:26.020
maybe the big scale of the universe?

04:01:29.140 --> 04:01:32.900
Children, my kids, but I also mean that in like a grand sense of like...

04:01:33.620 --> 04:01:39.860
Not a grand, but like future minds in some sense. So for me, like the most bleak movie ever,

04:01:40.500 --> 04:01:44.900
people worry about apocalyptic things like AI existential risk and climate change with children

04:01:44.900 --> 04:01:50.500
of men. The whole premise of the movie was there can be no children born on the entire planet,

04:01:50.500 --> 04:01:55.700
and the youngest person on the planet is like 18 years old or something. Can you imagine a world

04:01:55.700 --> 04:02:02.260
without children? It's harrowing, that's the scariest thing. So I think what gives me hope

04:02:02.260 --> 04:02:10.260
is always youth and the hope of children and the possibilities of the future they see. And they

04:02:10.260 --> 04:02:16.340
grow up in a completely different reality than adults do. And I think we have a hard time seeing

04:02:17.300 --> 04:02:23.380
what their reality actually looks like, but I think most of the time it's super interesting.

04:02:23.380 --> 04:02:29.220
Yeah, they have dreams, they have imagination, they have this kind of excitement. It's so cool,

04:02:29.220 --> 04:02:38.660
so fun to watch. And yeah, you feel like you're almost getting in the way of all that imagination.

04:02:38.660 --> 04:02:43.460
What about you, Lee? What gives you hope? So when I go back to my eight-year-old self,

04:02:44.500 --> 04:02:48.820
the thing that I dreamed of as my eight-year-old self was this world in which technology became

04:02:48.820 --> 04:02:54.260
programmable. When there was internet, I'd get information, and I would expand my consciousness

04:02:54.260 --> 04:03:01.700
by just getting access to everything that was going on. And this happened in my lifetime,

04:03:01.700 --> 04:03:05.300
and we really do have that. I mean, okay, there's some bad things, there's TikTok,

04:03:05.300 --> 04:03:09.060
everyone just don't, whatever, all the bad things about social media. But I think,

04:03:12.980 --> 04:03:17.460
I can't quite believe my luck being born now. So amazing.

04:03:18.020 --> 04:03:20.180
Being able to program reality in some way.

04:03:20.900 --> 04:03:26.980
And the thing that I really find fascinating about human beings is just how ingenious they are.

04:03:28.500 --> 04:03:36.020
Whether it's from my kids, my research group, my peers, other companies, just how ingenious

04:03:36.020 --> 04:03:43.700
everyone is. And I'm pretty sure humanity has, or our causal chain in which humanity is a vital

04:03:43.700 --> 04:03:49.060
part in the future is going to have a lot of fun. And I'm just, yeah, it's just mind-blowing just

04:03:49.060 --> 04:03:56.100
to watch. And so humans are ingenious, and I hope to help them be more ingenious if I can.

04:03:56.740 --> 04:04:03.380
Well, what gives me hope, what makes me feel good on bad days is the existence of wild minds like

04:04:03.380 --> 04:04:10.420
yours, novelty generators, assembly structures that generate novelty and do so beautifully,

04:04:10.420 --> 04:04:15.940
and then tweet about it. Sarah, I really, really enjoy talking to you. I enjoy following you.

04:04:15.940 --> 04:04:21.540
I'm a huge fan. Sarah Lee, I hope to talk to you many times in the future, maybe with Yoshua Bach.

04:04:21.540 --> 04:04:25.140
You're just incredible people. Thank you for everything you do. You're awesome. Thank you

04:04:25.140 --> 04:04:31.140
for talking today. I really, really appreciate it. Thanks for listening to this conversation

04:04:31.140 --> 04:04:35.700
with Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors

04:04:35.700 --> 04:04:40.100
in the description. Now, let me leave you with some words from Arthur C. Clarke.

04:04:40.980 --> 04:04:49.860
Two possibilities exist. Either we are alone in the universe or we are not. Both are equally

04:04:49.860 --> 04:04:58.420
terrifying. And let me, if I may, add to that by saying that both possibilities, at least to me,

04:04:58.420 --> 04:05:03.780
are both terrifying and exciting. And keeping these two feelings in my heart is a fun way to

04:05:03.780 --> 04:05:09.300
explore, to wander, to think, and to live, always a little bit on the edge of madness.

04:05:10.100 --> 04:05:13.460
Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
