00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
you have to have free markets in order to build prosperity.

00:04.840 --> 00:09.360
And prosperity means economic power.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.000
If you have economic power, no one messes with you.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.840
Or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice.

00:15.840 --> 00:18.640
And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.560
The following is a conversation with Magat Wade,

00:23.560 --> 00:25.920
an entrepreneur who's passionate

00:25.920 --> 00:28.120
about creating positive change in Africa

00:28.160 --> 00:31.000
through economic empowerment.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
This is the Alex Fridman podcast.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.120
in the description.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.680
And now, dear friends, here's Magat Wade.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.960
You were born in Senegal.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.480
You have lived and traveled across the world.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.360
So let me ask you, what is the soul of Senegal?

00:48.360 --> 00:51.840
Like, its people, its culture, its history.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.880
Can you try to sneak up on telling us

00:55.920 --> 00:58.200
what is the spirit of its people?

00:58.200 --> 00:59.640
Taranga.

00:59.640 --> 01:00.760
Taranga.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.880
Taranga, it's a Wolof word.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.720
Wolof is a main indigenous language of Senegal.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.880
And it means hospitality.

01:07.880 --> 01:11.600
That is what us, the people of Senegal, are known for.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.200
And it transpires in everything that we do,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.000
everything that we say.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.400
It's a place where, I guess with hospitality goes

01:20.400 --> 01:21.760
this concept of warmth.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.360
So we are a very warm people.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.480
In a nutshell, that's us.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.320
That's us.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.640
The place where you come

01:28.640 --> 01:31.480
and everybody will just embrace you,

01:31.480 --> 01:32.960
make you feel very comfortable,

01:32.960 --> 01:35.360
make you feel like you're the only person in the world

01:35.360 --> 01:37.760
and that we've been waiting for you our whole life, right?

01:37.760 --> 01:39.400
So that's my country.

01:39.400 --> 01:43.240
So that's for people in Senegal, people in Africa,

01:43.240 --> 01:45.760
or also people across the world,

01:45.760 --> 01:47.720
weird strangers from all walks of life.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.400
So hospitality to everyone.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.440
For everyone.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.360
For everyone.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.320
Especially towards the foreigner.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.960
Because it's very ingrained in us,

01:57.960 --> 02:00.920
this understanding that especially the foreigner,

02:00.920 --> 02:02.000
the foreigner is called foreigner

02:02.000 --> 02:03.800
because the foreigner is coming from somewhere else.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.120
So if someone has taken the time and the energy,

02:07.120 --> 02:09.600
whether in a forced manner,

02:09.600 --> 02:13.520
or because it's a choice to travel so far to come,

02:13.520 --> 02:15.520
to a place that's not theirs to start with,

02:15.520 --> 02:17.640
that's why we're foreigners again,

02:17.640 --> 02:20.640
then it is your duty to welcome them,

02:20.640 --> 02:23.120
to be uber-welcoming to them.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.000
So there's not a fear of the foreigner.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.720
There's not a suspicion of the foreigner.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.440
No, no, no.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.360
And I think this goes with the other way around.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.120
Maybe it has to do with just,

02:34.120 --> 02:36.120
you know, when you feel good about yourself,

02:36.120 --> 02:37.800
when you're very grounded yourself,

02:37.800 --> 02:39.920
it's very easy to open yourself to others.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.920
And I'm wondering if that's not, you know,

02:42.920 --> 02:45.640
the other side of the equation in a way.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.600
So no, we don't have a fear towards a foreigner.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.440
That's just not-

02:50.440 --> 02:53.840
When you have a pride of your culture,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.120
a pride of your own people,

02:55.120 --> 02:56.840
that it's easier to sort of embrace.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.120
I mean, it's interesting how these kind of cultures emerge

02:59.120 --> 03:02.720
because, you know, the Slavic countries,

03:02.720 --> 03:05.440
they're sometimes colder.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.840
They're slower to trust others.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.360
We're now here in Austin, Texas.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.160
One of the reasons I fell in love with this place

03:11.160 --> 03:13.880
when I showed up is there's that same hospitality

03:13.880 --> 03:17.240
as compared to other cities I've lived in,

03:17.240 --> 03:22.040
sort of Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.600
There's a hesitation to open up, to be fragile,

03:26.600 --> 03:31.320
to be caring before understanding

03:31.320 --> 03:33.560
what the sort of, what I can gain from you

03:33.560 --> 03:34.960
kind of calculation.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.800
It's really interesting.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.240
And I wonder how those kinds of dynamics emerge

03:39.240 --> 03:41.840
because there's certainly parts of the world,

03:41.840 --> 03:43.280
like Austin is one of them,

03:43.280 --> 03:45.080
where you just feel the kindness,

03:45.080 --> 03:48.320
just radiate without knowing kindness from strangers.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.760
You know, if I were to advance one thing,

03:52.760 --> 03:54.960
and I had the same experience

03:56.400 --> 03:59.560
after having lived in San Francisco first,

03:59.560 --> 04:02.600
then we went to New York, then we came to Austin.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.320
And when we came to Austin, I felt,

04:04.320 --> 04:06.360
it took me a while to put my finger on it,

04:06.360 --> 04:10.520
but what I found in Austin, people just hang.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.960
People, right?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.040
They're real.

04:13.040 --> 04:13.880
They're real.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
Unlike what you were saying,

04:15.680 --> 04:17.200
I feel like in these other places,

04:18.640 --> 04:21.320
it's a destination for people who want to come and perform.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.440
I think maybe the early San Francisco people,

04:24.440 --> 04:25.720
it was different for them.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.520
But later as prosperity starts to come in

04:30.520 --> 04:31.840
and success comes in,

04:31.840 --> 04:34.040
then you attract a different breed.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.160
At first, wherever people who made it,

04:36.160 --> 04:38.920
who made this place be what it is,

04:38.920 --> 04:41.960
and then it attracts all the bling followers

04:41.960 --> 04:43.800
and the bling attracted people.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.120
And when those people show up,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.240
it's time for all of us to get out.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.200
And that's one of my worries about Austin too.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.920
And I guess I count myself in it,

04:51.920 --> 04:54.840
because we're also new arrivees.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.200
Always been furious now.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.920
But how are we gonna protect this place?

04:58.920 --> 05:00.200
Yeah.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.840
Yeah, these are the best possible version

05:02.840 --> 05:04.320
of the Austin history.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.120
This is the early days of Silicon Valley in Austin.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.400
And so you get a chance to build

05:09.400 --> 05:12.960
on top of this culture that's already been here,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.880
of the weirdos, the artists,

05:15.880 --> 05:18.800
the sort of the characters,

05:18.800 --> 05:21.920
but also the general kindness and love

05:21.920 --> 05:23.120
that just permeates the whole place.

05:23.120 --> 05:27.520
Build on top of that entrepreneurial spirit.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.640
So like tech companies, new startups,

05:30.640 --> 05:31.800
all that kind of stuff.

05:31.800 --> 05:35.480
And then you get a chance to build totally new ideas,

05:35.480 --> 05:38.200
totally revolutionary ideas and make them a reality

05:38.200 --> 05:40.360
and dream big and build it here.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.440
I think Elon represents that with all the people

05:44.440 --> 05:49.440
that kind of try to do the cutting edge stuff

05:50.160 --> 05:52.520
they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.640
But there's a bunch of other companies,

05:53.640 --> 05:55.000
they're just like coming up,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.520
I get to talk to a bunch of tech people

05:56.520 --> 05:58.160
and they're just incredible.

05:58.160 --> 06:03.160
Versus San Francisco, there's a cynicism a bit

06:03.440 --> 06:06.480
and also some of the interaction with strangers.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.240
There's always a bit of a calculation,

06:08.720 --> 06:11.200
how good is this going to be for my career?

06:11.200 --> 06:13.960
Or how can, yeah, how can hanging out with this person

06:13.960 --> 06:14.800
can advance me?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.560
You go to a party, you're seizing,

06:16.560 --> 06:18.280
they're seizing up.

06:18.280 --> 06:19.600
It's like, I'm not gonna talk to someone

06:19.600 --> 06:21.200
so because that's not gonna advance me.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.520
Who's gonna advance me next?

06:22.520 --> 06:27.200
And so this is what I would not wanna see here in Austin.

06:27.200 --> 06:30.120
And I think maybe there's one way to try to,

06:30.120 --> 06:32.640
I really would like to see Austin not go away,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.680
San Francisco did and other towns before.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.040
I like how you pronounce San Francisco

06:36.040 --> 06:36.880
with a French accent.

06:37.040 --> 06:37.880
San Francisco.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.920
That's great, that's the one word,

06:40.920 --> 06:42.160
you go with a French accent.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.000
You have to.

06:43.000 --> 06:43.840
It sounds beautiful.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.680
San Francisco.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.840
San Francisco.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.400
But you know, so now that you find that cute,

06:50.400 --> 06:51.800
you're gonna have to forgive me

06:51.800 --> 06:53.200
when I mess up my English

06:53.200 --> 06:55.280
because English is not my first language.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.240
So I always try to make sure people know that.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.080
But you know, Lex, this is why I am very interested

07:01.080 --> 07:03.840
in what some folks here are working on

07:03.840 --> 07:05.520
and I'm just gonna be very selfish here

07:05.520 --> 07:07.960
because I wanna help her with what she's doing.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.680
It's someone like, you know, Nicole Nocek

07:10.680 --> 07:12.080
and her project, you know,

07:12.080 --> 07:14.560
with the housing project that they have right now,

07:14.560 --> 07:16.800
making sure that Austin remains a town

07:16.800 --> 07:20.480
that's affordable for people of all walks of life.

07:20.480 --> 07:24.120
If we can accomplish making sure that all walks of life,

07:24.120 --> 07:28.320
doesn't matter how little or big you're making money wise,

07:28.320 --> 07:29.640
that you can stay in this town

07:29.640 --> 07:32.080
so the diversity at that level can remain,

07:32.080 --> 07:33.640
then I think Austin stands a chance

07:33.640 --> 07:36.360
to really show the world how to do things differently.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.680
And what I love about her initiative

07:38.680 --> 07:41.360
is just how they're really trying,

07:42.400 --> 07:43.440
you know, to again,

07:43.440 --> 07:47.000
work on keeping affordability down for most people.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.920
I think it's important to,

07:48.920 --> 07:50.440
because it seems like it matters to you,

07:50.440 --> 07:51.920
I know that it matters to me.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.400
I absolutely would not wanna see Austin go away

07:55.400 --> 07:56.240
that San Francisco did.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.640
And I think the key to that is making sure

07:58.640 --> 07:59.560
that true diversity,

07:59.560 --> 08:01.440
not like the fluff fluff crap diversity

08:01.440 --> 08:02.320
we're hearing over there.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.680
And that's another thing by the way,

08:03.680 --> 08:05.800
because San Francisco likes to pride itself in,

08:05.800 --> 08:09.280
oh, you know, we are so into diversity,

08:09.280 --> 08:13.160
but I'm like, if diversity for you means gender,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.720
difference of gender, skin color,

08:15.720 --> 08:18.200
you know, maybe the different accents we have,

08:18.200 --> 08:19.840
and you think check, check, check, check, check,

08:19.840 --> 08:21.840
I'm like, it's not enough.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.240
Can we also add diversity of thoughts?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.120
And that's the other problem I have with that place,

08:26.120 --> 08:26.960
you know?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.600
And I know some folks who are scared

08:28.600 --> 08:30.680
of saying much around people,

08:30.680 --> 08:32.040
that's also another thing.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.760
So not only they're sizing you up,

08:33.760 --> 08:36.800
but everybody's also, there is this invisible,

08:36.800 --> 08:40.600
this invisible, how should I say this?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.360
There's this invisible agreement

08:43.360 --> 08:46.100
that they all seem to have to stay on script.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.600
Yeah, there's a feeling like you're following

08:48.600 --> 08:51.720
a certain kind of script that's very kind of shallow.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.240
And there is a bit of a categorization going on,

08:54.240 --> 08:55.840
which category do you belong to?

08:55.840 --> 08:58.800
And let's put this into a simple math equation,

08:58.840 --> 09:03.720
what comes out as opposed to just the free open embrace

09:03.720 --> 09:06.960
of people, the weirdos, the characters, the interesting,

09:06.960 --> 09:09.400
the full deep sense of diversity.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.240
Exactly.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.880
Not just ideas, but backgrounds and rich and poor,

09:16.360 --> 09:17.480
Artists, engineers,

09:17.480 --> 09:20.640
High school dropouts, PhDs, all of this.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.040
Yes, yes.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.640
That's what makes for a rich society

09:24.640 --> 09:25.840
that's gonna get ahead.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.600
I'm glad you mentioned Nicole's efforts.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.200
I know she really is passionate about,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.760
I don't know how complicated that work is

09:32.760 --> 09:37.760
because there's probably a big force trying to increase

09:40.120 --> 09:42.160
how much it costs to live in Austin.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.200
I don't know how you resist that.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.080
Whenever I go to New York City,

09:47.080 --> 09:50.760
just the fact that there's a giant park in the middle of it,

09:50.760 --> 09:53.320
I wonder like, how did they pull this off?

09:53.320 --> 09:54.720
This is amazing.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.280
It's like to resist the force

09:57.280 --> 10:00.240
of the increasing price of the land

10:00.240 --> 10:05.120
and still to protect this idea of having a park.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.640
And then in the same way,

10:06.640 --> 10:10.040
protecting the ability for people from all walks of life

10:10.040 --> 10:13.280
to live in the center of the city, to live around the city,

10:13.280 --> 10:16.920
to chase a dream when they don't get any money

10:16.920 --> 10:17.760
in their pocket.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.600
Absolutely.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.440
I don't know how you do that.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.720
It's partly political probably,

10:21.720 --> 10:23.360
regulation, all that kind of stuff.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.040
A lot of it has to do with regulations.

10:26.040 --> 10:31.040
And this is where her and I also very much see eye to eye

10:31.320 --> 10:35.800
in terms of the free markets and also prosperity building,

10:35.800 --> 10:38.000
because it's always the same problems

10:38.000 --> 10:40.400
most of the time, most places.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.440
Here what you have is some people in the name of,

10:43.440 --> 10:47.680
we gotta stand for, and I don't like to use this word,

10:47.680 --> 10:49.920
but maybe you help me find a better one,

10:49.920 --> 10:52.040
but at least that's a word that people can understand.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.640
We gotta stand for the lesser fortunate among us.

10:54.640 --> 10:55.960
Some people would like call them,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.080
maybe oftentimes use the word, maybe the underdogs,

10:58.080 --> 10:59.520
whatever it is, I will just say,

10:59.520 --> 11:01.720
maybe the lesser fortunate among us, right?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.480
In the name of standing up for them,

11:04.480 --> 11:07.840
you're promoting policies that are actually gonna backfire

11:07.840 --> 11:10.200
and where they end up being the first ones

11:10.200 --> 11:11.280
to suffer from it.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.200
So let's take this whole housing issue

11:14.200 --> 11:16.120
that Nicole and her team are working on.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.480
We find that oftentimes the cost, at the end of the day,

11:20.520 --> 11:25.520
it's the good old supply and demand equation.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.440
If you're gonna make it so hard

11:29.440 --> 11:33.400
that the supply level of housing remains

11:33.400 --> 11:35.120
below a certain threshold,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.760
remains lower than the demand of people who need

11:38.760 --> 11:41.680
especially affordable housing altogether,

11:41.680 --> 11:45.800
what's gonna happen is scarcity, prices go up,

11:45.800 --> 11:47.560
and who gets kicked out first?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.560
The lesser fortunate among us.

11:50.440 --> 11:54.280
But I find that oftentimes people in the name of we care,

11:54.280 --> 11:55.560
don't engage their mind.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.000
And a friend of mine said this, and he said it so well,

11:58.000 --> 12:03.000
he said, having a heart for the poor, that's easy.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.400
Having a mind for the poor, that's the challenge.

12:06.400 --> 12:10.080
And oftentimes we all have a heart for the poor.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.360
But when it comes then to, then what do we do

12:13.360 --> 12:17.760
to have a real impact on making sure that people

12:17.840 --> 12:20.920
get a chance at going up,

12:20.920 --> 12:23.400
then that's where everything starts falling apart.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.720
And then you have people who,

12:25.720 --> 12:28.560
then they start pushing for policies, housing policies,

12:28.560 --> 12:30.840
making it super hard for you to even renovate

12:30.840 --> 12:33.800
or add one more story to your home or anything like that.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.080
By doing that, you're messing up with the supply,

12:36.080 --> 12:39.240
with the supply of housing.

12:39.240 --> 12:43.080
And therefore the people who can't afford,

12:43.080 --> 12:45.200
people get priced out of the market.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.160
And so what people like Nicole are doing

12:47.160 --> 12:49.360
are going back to where all of this is taking place

12:49.360 --> 12:51.280
and they're going back to the regulation side.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.440
And just like, I'm sure we'll talk about it here,

12:53.440 --> 12:56.200
but people wonder today, why is Africa

12:56.200 --> 12:58.000
the poorest region in the world?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
We go back to the same culprit, bad laws

13:02.000 --> 13:04.640
and tons of senseless regulations.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.000
If you make it so hard that in Berkeley,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.400
for someone to build one more story to their home,

13:09.400 --> 13:11.840
which means maybe one more unit

13:11.840 --> 13:13.440
that could be rented out to someone.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.640
And if many more people do that

13:14.640 --> 13:16.600
and you have a much bigger supply,

13:16.600 --> 13:18.360
which means the prices will go down,

13:18.360 --> 13:20.760
which means more people have access among them,

13:20.760 --> 13:22.960
especially the lesser fortunate among us,

13:22.960 --> 13:25.560
then we're starting to see a winning proposal, aren't we?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.440
But instead, if you go the other way around,

13:27.440 --> 13:29.400
then all of a sudden you're pricing them out of the market.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
Same thing was done with us.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.560
So oftentimes when I see problems of this nature,

13:33.560 --> 13:36.000
you can bet you that regulations

13:36.000 --> 13:37.960
and senseless laws are the heart of it.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.560
And that's what they're tackling.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.720
It's not popular, it's not fun.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.360
And people tend to not even understand

13:43.360 --> 13:44.520
where you're coming from.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.560
But this is a problem we have

13:45.560 --> 13:48.840
of people not understanding economic econ 101.

13:48.840 --> 13:50.440
Well, so it's the regulation, the laws,

13:50.440 --> 13:51.800
and the system that props them up

13:51.800 --> 13:53.880
and increases the span of those laws.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.200
And we'll talk about that,

13:55.200 --> 13:57.920
the fascinating way those kinds of things develop,

13:57.920 --> 13:59.680
when it works, when it doesn't.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.520
Let me sort of step back

14:01.520 --> 14:03.200
and ask you a question about Africa.

14:03.200 --> 14:06.960
In the West, in many places in the world,

14:06.960 --> 14:10.640
Africa is almost talked about like it's one country,

14:10.640 --> 14:12.240
like it's one place.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.720
So in what ways is Africa one community?

14:16.720 --> 14:20.120
And in what ways is it many, many, many communities,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.240
just from your perspective,

14:22.240 --> 14:24.680
from in Senegal and beyond?

14:24.680 --> 14:25.960
Right.

14:25.960 --> 14:30.960
So at the most basic of what makes us one

14:30.960 --> 14:33.320
goes back to even what makes you African.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.960
You are African, I'm African.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.520
We're one big family.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.360
Africa is very much at the end of the day,

14:38.520 --> 14:43.520
the foundation and the birth of the human race.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.600
So from that standpoint, at the most basic level,

14:47.600 --> 14:48.440
we're all Africans.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.040
Where this whole thing started.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.640
Exactly, exactly.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.160
Where this whole thing started

14:53.160 --> 14:55.240
and how at some point,

14:55.240 --> 14:57.600
humanity was hanging by its fingernails.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.880
Only 2,000 of us were left on this earth.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.200
And eventually we started, we went for survival.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.280
And that's how we started to spread around

15:04.280 --> 15:07.360
and some going up north, some going this way, that way.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.680
And as you're traveling to different places,

15:09.680 --> 15:13.000
then features start to change to adapt to where you are.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.840
Right?

15:13.840 --> 15:16.160
So hair gets lighter for some people,

15:16.160 --> 15:17.920
eyes get different shape for others

15:17.920 --> 15:21.280
to adjust to our new natural habitat.

15:21.280 --> 15:22.720
You know, the genomics program,

15:22.720 --> 15:26.960
I think at the National Geographic did that so well

15:26.960 --> 15:28.720
for people who are interested in going back to that work

15:28.720 --> 15:30.320
with Spencer Wells and such.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.040
But yeah, so at the very basic, most basic level,

15:34.040 --> 15:37.040
that's what unites us all, first of all.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.840
And then I would say that the continent,

15:40.840 --> 15:43.920
especially here, I will group it into black Africa,

15:43.920 --> 15:45.120
you know, black Africa.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.600
Unfortunately, our common stories, you know,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.720
of having gone through this terrible,

15:52.720 --> 15:55.600
horrible period of around the same time,

15:55.600 --> 15:58.480
the whole continent being enslaved and colonized.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.560
So that in a way forms,

16:00.560 --> 16:03.160
not that we were ever the first people

16:03.160 --> 16:06.280
or only people ever enslaved in this world.

16:06.520 --> 16:08.200
As a matter of fact, I mean, the world,

16:08.200 --> 16:10.360
slaves comes from, you know,

16:10.360 --> 16:13.640
esclave, slave, slavs, les slavs, right?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.040
From the Eastern Bloc.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.760
So the first slaves were actually people

16:16.760 --> 16:20.240
looking more like you than looking like me, right?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.560
But we don't necessarily remember all of that

16:22.560 --> 16:25.320
because in our human psyche,

16:25.320 --> 16:28.160
the closest to us in history

16:28.160 --> 16:32.640
of a big mass of people being enslaved is African people.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.760
We were the last, you know, group like that.

16:35.760 --> 16:39.080
You know, the pain of World War I and World War II

16:39.080 --> 16:43.720
permeates Europe, but it certainly does

16:43.720 --> 16:45.880
for the Soviet, the former Soviet Union,

16:45.880 --> 16:48.200
the countries that made up the former Soviet Union.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.480
Does in the same way,

16:50.480 --> 16:55.480
the pain of slavery

16:56.760 --> 16:59.640
and empires using Africa,

16:59.640 --> 17:01.240
does that permeate the culture?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.960
Is there still echoes of that?

17:02.960 --> 17:06.480
In a way, yes, especially the fact that, you know,

17:06.480 --> 17:09.160
in many different places,

17:09.160 --> 17:12.440
whether it's Ghana or my country or Benin,

17:12.440 --> 17:15.120
where you have these places

17:15.120 --> 17:16.880
that we call the door of no return

17:16.880 --> 17:18.640
or the places of no return,

17:18.640 --> 17:22.480
which this was the last place

17:22.480 --> 17:25.840
where the slaves were standing or, you know,

17:25.840 --> 17:29.040
this is in Senegal, we call it the door of no return.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.720
There is this one door, you're there in the slave house.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.640
And once they go, they go, that's it.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.000
It's gonna be the last time they see back home.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.400
So, you know, those, of course, of course,

17:43.400 --> 17:48.400
it creates for a common lived experience,

17:48.720 --> 17:52.720
which becomes a common lived history.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.800
And of course, it's gonna tie us up.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.520
Is there a resentment, because you mentioned hospitality,

18:00.520 --> 18:03.560
is there a kind of resentment of the foreigner

18:03.560 --> 18:07.120
that there's a rich, vibrant land?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.520
There's many resources, there's powerful cultures.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.280
Are they just going to show up and use us?

18:13.280 --> 18:14.120
Yeah.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.560
That's a way to see geopolitics in this modern world.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.840
Yeah, this is, okay, so where it plays very differently is,

18:19.840 --> 18:21.400
so if you came to Senegal today,

18:21.400 --> 18:24.000
there is not really a problem at that level.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.160
Where people's resentment start to come from

18:27.120 --> 18:31.200
is, of course, when bad behavior shows up,

18:31.200 --> 18:33.880
meaning like you have so many white people who can show up

18:33.880 --> 18:35.360
and just in their attitude,

18:35.360 --> 18:38.680
they have an entitlement attitude, right?

18:38.680 --> 18:43.280
And they think, but in a way, we're all still servants.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.120
Some people in your face, some people more,

18:46.120 --> 18:48.360
but that can cause some little resentment.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.200
But where really the resentment is.

18:51.360 --> 18:53.560
And that can, the entitlement can take different forms,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.200
even pity.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.480
Yes, don't even get me going on that one.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.120
I was trying to be polite today.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.120
So just don't, Lex, do not.

19:02.120 --> 19:03.480
Sometimes I tell myself, my God,

19:03.480 --> 19:05.520
today you're going to be all composed.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.720
Lex is all composed,

19:06.720 --> 19:08.600
so don't go over and make a fool of yourself.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.440
Just behave.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.280
Yeah, hold it together.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.360
But if you get me on some grounds,

19:12.360 --> 19:15.120
that's when it's all going to go to hell.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.840
So yeah, let's move beyond that too.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.080
So resentment, there's a dance

19:20.080 --> 19:21.440
between hospitality and resentment.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.400
And resentment.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.280
So when you come in, you're you, you live your life.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.880
You're just a normal human being.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.920
And you treat me decently,

19:27.920 --> 19:30.160
like you would treat a friend, normal people.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.240
I have no problem with you.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.320
I'm not going to come back and be like,

19:32.320 --> 19:35.720
well, you and your ancestors have enslaved me.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.280
You're not going to see that stuff.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.560
Sometimes I'm in this country where I feel like it's,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.600
you know, it might look like that.

19:42.600 --> 19:45.600
But we in Africa don't do that.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.680
Now, if you come, you have this nasty attitude.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.280
You think you're still serving servants around.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.040
Well, you can have a problem with someone like me.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.040
I might even grab you by the back of your neck

19:54.040 --> 19:56.080
and, you know, take you back to the airport.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.200
That's when you're lucky.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.600
Yeah.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.000
Helping you very quickly.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.840
Exactly.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.080
But where things come up is,

20:05.080 --> 20:07.840
especially nowadays with the African youth,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.600
when we have to be reminded of the World Bank,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.400
when we have to be reminded of even the world,

20:13.400 --> 20:14.720
places like the World Economic Forum.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.720
You know, like all of these places that seem to constitute,

20:18.480 --> 20:21.480
the way they describe them, when I say they,

20:21.480 --> 20:24.400
it's primarily my Pan-African friends.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.680
So here maybe terms are worth describing.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.640
So the Pan-African movement goes way back when,

20:35.520 --> 20:38.000
we're talking about, you know, way back when,

20:38.000 --> 20:43.000
started in the 30s, going on all the way from there.

20:43.560 --> 20:48.560
So what you have there is people who have started

20:48.560 --> 20:53.560
coming together and dreaming up an emancipated Africa,

20:53.560 --> 20:55.880
away from the colonies, because at that point,

20:55.880 --> 20:58.640
there were still colonies, and dreaming up all of that.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.680
So we're talking about people like Kwame Kuma of Ghana,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.000
we're talking about Julius Nyerere of Tanzania,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.040
talking about Blaise Tien of Senegal,

21:06.040 --> 21:08.720
and other people like that, Bandia of Malawi.

21:08.720 --> 21:12.080
So anyway, so, and the African youth of today,

21:12.920 --> 21:15.160
we're still hanging on to those,

21:15.160 --> 21:16.760
onto some of these ideas of,

21:16.760 --> 21:19.840
and on some of these dreams of a reunited Africa.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.880
So when you were talking about what seems to unite you,

21:22.880 --> 21:25.200
there is that, you know, also,

21:25.200 --> 21:27.960
meaning like we all feel like we're part of the same family.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.520
Is it only in our heads, is it in reality?

21:30.520 --> 21:31.640
For many different reasons,

21:31.640 --> 21:34.400
there is definitely what we call a Pan-African movement.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.360
And I very much myself, consider myself one of them,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.480
I don't agree all the time with our,

21:40.480 --> 21:42.880
where we wanna go and how we wanna go there,

21:42.880 --> 21:45.320
but not where we wanna go.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.160
Where we wanna go is,

21:46.160 --> 21:48.640
we would love to see a united Africa, for sure.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.360
But how to get that accomplished,

21:50.360 --> 21:52.440
that's where oftentimes we have issues.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.440
So on something like that,

21:55.440 --> 21:57.760
so this Pan-African, especially the Pan-African youth,

21:57.760 --> 21:59.840
but it's beyond the Pan-African youth,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.440
it's the youth in general in Africa,

22:02.440 --> 22:04.960
World Bank, UN, all of these organizations

22:04.960 --> 22:09.600
that they tend to qualify as imperialist organizations.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.360
And it's not always the correct way to describe them,

22:12.360 --> 22:14.440
but I'm sure you get the sentiment.

22:14.440 --> 22:19.440
And from that place, there is tons of resentment,

22:19.840 --> 22:22.040
because for the longest time,

22:22.040 --> 22:24.720
these groups, organizations,

22:24.720 --> 22:27.200
and some that preceded them,

22:27.200 --> 22:30.640
have proceeded to actually decide

22:30.640 --> 22:32.680
what even our new frontiers would be.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.240
You see, when you go to a place like Senegal, Mali,

22:36.240 --> 22:37.760
all of that, different countries,

22:37.760 --> 22:39.080
but we were one people,

22:40.200 --> 22:42.400
one group, one kingdom.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.240
And then at some point, they decided,

22:45.240 --> 22:46.240
just when you look at Africa,

22:46.240 --> 22:49.040
have you looked at how straight some of these borders are?

22:49.040 --> 22:51.440
You're like, did a robot just draw these?

22:51.440 --> 22:52.280
Really, these are not-

22:52.280 --> 22:53.120
No offense to robots.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.600
No offense to robots, especially this one,

22:54.600 --> 22:55.520
it looks so cute.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.640
But you know what I mean?

22:56.640 --> 23:01.640
So they have continued deciding what it would be

23:02.320 --> 23:07.320
to be us, to live on our land,

23:08.480 --> 23:10.280
and how do we even progress?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.920
And it just keeps on going.

23:11.920 --> 23:16.840
They get to decide how are we gonna,

23:16.840 --> 23:19.120
which type of even economic development path

23:19.120 --> 23:20.480
are we gonna choose or not?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.640
So it's very, so from that standpoint,

23:22.640 --> 23:23.960
yes, there's a lot of resentment,

23:23.960 --> 23:25.720
including even from people like me.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.560
Yeah, and it's interesting that the invader

23:27.560 --> 23:29.560
and the oppressor and the empires

23:29.600 --> 23:33.320
have actually created a force for unity.

23:33.320 --> 23:37.000
I've seen that in Ukraine, in the invasion in Ukraine,

23:37.000 --> 23:39.320
where it was a pretty divided, not a pretty,

23:39.320 --> 23:41.760
a very divided country with many factions.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.840
But the invasion really forced everyone to think

23:45.840 --> 23:48.800
about the identity of this nation together.

23:48.800 --> 23:51.240
Beyond factions, beyond all of that,

23:51.240 --> 23:55.160
it allowed it to look at its history and its future.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.560
They all say that all great nations

23:57.600 --> 24:00.600
have had to have a war of independence.

24:00.600 --> 24:04.680
And this is our war to find our own identity.

24:04.680 --> 24:09.400
And so in that sense, Africa as one place,

24:09.400 --> 24:14.400
as one continent, had to find multiple times its identity

24:14.840 --> 24:17.200
through the resistance of the oppressor.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.880
Especially Sub-Saharan Africa,

24:18.880 --> 24:20.680
especially Sub-Saharan Africa, yes.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.120
And there's an interesting aspect to this

24:22.120 --> 24:25.120
because the president of Senegal is also the,

24:25.120 --> 24:26.920
you know, the head of the African Union.

24:26.920 --> 24:30.160
So we'll talk about the fascinating geopolitics

24:30.160 --> 24:33.560
of that whole situation.

24:33.560 --> 24:36.200
But let me ask in general,

24:37.560 --> 24:41.200
you talk about this question, this fascinating question,

24:41.200 --> 24:43.440
what does it take for a country to prosper?

24:44.840 --> 24:48.000
What does it take for a country to prosper?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.960
You see many countries in the world that really struggle

24:51.960 --> 24:54.520
and many that flourish.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.920
And it's not always obvious why,

24:56.920 --> 25:00.400
because some have natural resources, some don't.

25:00.400 --> 25:05.000
Some have wars, some don't.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
Some have sort of authoritarian regimes, some don't.

25:11.160 --> 25:13.560
And some have democracies and all that kind of stuff.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.200
So the dynamics aren't exactly obvious.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.240
Is there commonalities?

25:18.240 --> 25:22.080
Is there fundamental ideas

25:22.080 --> 25:24.840
that result in a prosperity of a nation?

25:24.840 --> 25:27.480
Today, I can confidently say yes,

25:27.480 --> 25:29.920
despite all the differences that you talked about.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.360
And I think then this is where it becomes very important

25:33.360 --> 25:37.360
that we are very clear about the question you asked me.

25:37.360 --> 25:41.760
You said, what does it take to make a country prosperous?

25:41.760 --> 25:44.280
So I'm just gonna stick to prosperity

25:44.280 --> 25:47.000
because prosperity doesn't necessarily mean,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.400
sometimes has nothing to do with maybe

25:49.400 --> 25:54.400
how you conduct yourself, otherwise socially speaking.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.760
So you can be prosperous.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.160
And still, when it comes to your family laws,

26:02.160 --> 26:04.640
all the way you approach the other aspects of your life,

26:04.640 --> 26:07.800
maybe you're running a very communist lifestyle

26:09.040 --> 26:14.040
or you're in a very liberal society.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.640
So for me, when we talk about prosperity,

26:16.640 --> 26:18.560
I just want to make sure that we are clear on that.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.480
Because some people might be somewhere and be like,

26:21.480 --> 26:25.080
well, because I know what I'm gonna talk to you about next.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.160
And some people are gonna sit there and be like,

26:26.160 --> 26:27.720
well, China is not like that.

26:27.720 --> 26:32.640
Or even Dubai is not like that.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.600
No, so what I'm talking about is this thing.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.680
And that's what I love about this.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
If we just stick to the word prosperity.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.000
To me, I see prosperity as this.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.480
It's like, economically speaking,

26:40.480 --> 26:43.120
what are we gonna be to be a prosperous nation?

26:43.120 --> 26:46.760
Meaning we are a middle to high income nation.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.600
I'm not talking about

26:48.600 --> 26:51.920
what are the rights of your women to vote

26:51.920 --> 26:55.920
or can people live like this or...

26:55.920 --> 26:56.760
I'm not talking about any of that.

26:56.760 --> 27:00.240
Economic, fundamentally economic prosperity.

27:00.240 --> 27:02.000
Because I think that distinction is very important

27:02.000 --> 27:03.040
because over the years,

27:03.040 --> 27:05.240
I've seen people push back on all types of things.

27:05.240 --> 27:07.320
And it occurred to me that that's what

27:07.320 --> 27:08.760
the misunderstanding was there.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.160
So if we're gonna talk about prosperity,

27:11.160 --> 27:13.200
making sure that the country can make money

27:13.200 --> 27:15.040
so that it can take care of its needs

27:15.080 --> 27:17.400
and the needs of its citizens,

27:17.400 --> 27:21.160
then what I have come to find is that

27:21.160 --> 27:23.480
at the root of that is gonna be

27:23.480 --> 27:25.480
what we call economic freedom

27:25.480 --> 27:28.360
and what I call the toolkit of the entrepreneur.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.440
In that, you can put the rule of law.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.200
You can put the concept of clear

27:32.200 --> 27:34.160
and transferable property rights.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.920
Economic freedom is at all the levels

27:37.920 --> 27:41.680
that which will allow entrepreneurs

27:42.640 --> 27:47.000
and business people to create value

27:47.000 --> 27:48.880
and create value entrepreneurially.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.080
We're not talking about rent seeking or anything like that.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.440
It's like you found a pie to be this big

27:53.440 --> 27:55.720
and you make it this big.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.680
So that's what we're talking about.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.640
Create value.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.640
Create value, yes.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.600
So when it comes to that,

28:02.600 --> 28:06.720
we have found that whether you're looking at

28:06.720 --> 28:08.560
two countries that start out the same,

28:08.560 --> 28:10.280
we're talking the same people,

28:10.280 --> 28:12.840
East Germany, West Germany,

28:12.840 --> 28:15.120
South Korea, North Korea.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.040
Very similar people to start with, right?

28:19.040 --> 28:22.960
But yet radical outcomes.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.120
I know that today Germany is united,

28:26.120 --> 28:27.520
but we're talking about back in the days

28:27.520 --> 28:29.400
when you had East and Western bloc.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.800
Same people, very different outcomes.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.840
Like I said, South Korea, North Korea,

28:35.840 --> 28:37.000
and so on and so forth.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.880
And at the same time, very different nations.

28:40.760 --> 28:45.760
Dubai compared to Singapore or to England.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.400
Very different yet the same outcome.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.520
So it seems to me like whenever we're looking at prosperity,

28:53.520 --> 28:55.440
if a nation is prosperous,

28:55.440 --> 28:58.800
regardless of whatever other shenanigans

28:58.800 --> 28:59.760
they might be running,

28:59.760 --> 29:03.000
whatever other operating software

29:03.000 --> 29:04.800
they might be running for anything

29:04.800 --> 29:07.200
that's not related to business,

29:07.200 --> 29:08.800
if on the business side,

29:09.840 --> 29:12.800
they are proponents of a free market

29:12.800 --> 29:17.800
or at least base level of free markets,

29:18.160 --> 29:21.440
we know that such countries will create prosperity.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.360
So what are the aspects of the operating systems

29:23.360 --> 29:26.840
that lead to Singapore and to South Korea

29:26.840 --> 29:27.760
and all that kind of stuff?

29:27.760 --> 29:30.080
So can you speak to different elements

29:30.080 --> 29:32.000
that enable the toolkit for entrepreneurs?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.560
Sure, sure.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.640
And maybe here,

29:35.640 --> 29:38.200
let me just maybe illustrate it with my own story

29:38.200 --> 29:40.240
and then I can take you back to-

29:40.240 --> 29:41.080
Yeah, what's your-

29:41.080 --> 29:43.720
Oh my God, tell us your story.

29:43.720 --> 29:44.560
No, no.

29:44.560 --> 29:45.400
Who are you?

29:45.400 --> 29:46.920
It's just because it started with me coming here.

29:46.920 --> 29:47.920
You showed me the robot and everything

29:47.920 --> 29:50.520
and now it looks like we've known each other for 12.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.480
And then you're like, tell people.

29:52.480 --> 29:56.120
No, no, no, but so this is where this question,

29:56.120 --> 29:57.080
even when you asked me,

29:57.080 --> 30:00.640
how do some countries become prosperous?

30:01.520 --> 30:06.400
That question, Lex, I had it when I was seven or so.

30:06.400 --> 30:11.120
That's when my family moved me from Senegal

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
for the first time of my life.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.400
I left my country, I left my continent

30:14.400 --> 30:17.680
and I was headed to Europe to go join my people,

30:17.680 --> 30:21.800
my family, my parents who were there as economic migrants.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.600
My parents had migrated for a better life

30:24.600 --> 30:27.080
as so many people have to,

30:27.080 --> 30:29.880
so many people have to coming from poorer places,

30:29.920 --> 30:31.400
coming from low-income countries.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.680
So you saw the difference-

30:32.680 --> 30:33.520
Yes!

30:33.520 --> 30:34.680
Between the two places.

30:35.840 --> 30:37.280
How else would you call it?

30:37.280 --> 30:40.160
Here you are in Senegal, minding your own business,

30:40.160 --> 30:41.800
causing tons of trouble everywhere,

30:41.800 --> 30:45.480
you know, just being a happy, free-range kid, but I was.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.480
Yeah, so you were always a troublemaker, not just now.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.320
Okay, great.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.440
Life wouldn't be fun without you.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.640
Yeah, and of course, I agree.

30:51.640 --> 30:52.480
I think you're right.

30:52.480 --> 30:53.320
So, because even you, you know,

30:53.320 --> 30:55.760
when you're all put together like front,

30:55.760 --> 30:57.960
I know there's a lot of troublemaking behind you.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.880
You're desperately trying to keep it together.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.280
I know you are, but with me,

31:01.280 --> 31:02.640
I'm gonna totally bring it out.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.640
So just, yeah, so-

31:04.640 --> 31:05.720
So you saw the difference.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.640
Right, I saw the difference.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.360
I'm walking in here, back home,

31:09.360 --> 31:10.440
and I tell people this story

31:10.440 --> 31:13.440
because to me, it's a defining story.

31:13.440 --> 31:18.320
Back home, to take a shower, it takes time.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.840
Grandma has to, you know, make the charcoal catch

31:21.840 --> 31:25.720
on a little stove like you use when you go camping,

31:25.720 --> 31:27.960
and then she puts a pot of water on it.

31:27.960 --> 31:28.800
It boils.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.680
She takes it, puts it in a bigger bucket,

31:30.680 --> 31:32.440
mixes it with some colder water.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.400
Then we put a little pot in it,

31:34.400 --> 31:36.080
and a stronger member of the family

31:36.080 --> 31:37.720
has to drag it to the shower,

31:37.720 --> 31:40.760
and then there, finally, I can proceed to take my shower.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.800
Here I'm in Germany in the middle of the winter,

31:43.800 --> 31:45.720
and my mom's like, my God, time for your shower.

31:45.720 --> 31:47.440
I'm like, I'm not getting naked.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.280
Where's the water?

31:48.280 --> 31:51.280
Where's the bucket of hot water?

31:51.280 --> 31:53.640
She's like, oh, you silly, come on, just jump in.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.840
And I jump in the shower, turn the buttons,

31:55.840 --> 31:57.040
the water is coming down, temperature,

31:57.040 --> 31:58.400
I want to be playing with.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.320
She's like, are you kidding me?

32:00.320 --> 32:01.160
It's so amazing.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.600
I've been cheated out of life, my whole life.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.120
So that's what happened.

32:05.120 --> 32:08.600
And then I'm like, oh, and all of these roads,

32:08.600 --> 32:10.440
they're paved roads, unlike back home,

32:10.440 --> 32:13.760
everything is like sandy, and my feet are always ashy.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.280
I always have to wash off when I go back home,

32:16.280 --> 32:18.560
and your shoes get ruined most of the time.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.280
And it started, and I had this question,

32:22.360 --> 32:25.200
it was just like, wow, how come they have this,

32:25.200 --> 32:26.760
and we don't?

32:26.760 --> 32:28.880
So I was not being like, oh, you know,

32:28.880 --> 32:30.480
how come they have all of this money?

32:30.480 --> 32:32.640
I was not that, it was just like, how come?

32:32.640 --> 32:34.800
And I think what I was alluding to was,

32:34.800 --> 32:39.280
how come life is so easy here, and back home it's not?

32:39.280 --> 32:43.240
And easy, not in a negative sense, in a beautiful sense.

32:43.240 --> 32:47.080
Sometimes I get, just having traveled through the war zone,

32:47.080 --> 32:49.680
just to come back, traveling through Europe,

32:49.680 --> 32:52.560
back to America, I'll just get emotional

32:52.560 --> 32:54.560
just looking at the efficiency of things,

32:54.560 --> 32:58.160
like how easy it is, how we can,

32:59.520 --> 33:02.400
first of all, in Ukraine you currently can't fly, right?

33:02.400 --> 33:03.240
It's a war zone.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.400
Just even the transportation, you said roads.

33:06.400 --> 33:09.520
Yeah, the quality of roads in the United States is amazing.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.720
Just not, you know, many of the places

33:11.720 --> 33:14.920
that drive in Ukraine, you're talking about,

33:14.920 --> 33:19.320
I mean, really bad conditions of roads.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.280
And I'm sure in many parts of Africa,

33:21.280 --> 33:23.760
in many parts of the world, the roads are even worse.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
Right, right.

33:24.760 --> 33:28.400
And outdoor, you know, having an indoor toilet

33:28.400 --> 33:32.480
is a fascinatingly awesome luxury to have.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.680
It is, it is.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.440
And don't take me wrong, Lex,

33:35.440 --> 33:40.440
do we have some great roads now in many parts of Africa?

33:41.400 --> 33:44.120
Yes, main arteries, great roads,

33:44.120 --> 33:45.880
you're like, whoa, this is moving.

33:46.880 --> 33:48.640
Yes, we do.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.600
But definitely more today than in my time growing up.

33:53.960 --> 33:58.120
Do we have, you know, a country like Nigeria

33:58.120 --> 34:02.360
that just birthed six unicorns last year alone?

34:02.360 --> 34:03.320
Yes.

34:03.320 --> 34:07.880
Do we have the African youth out there being so amazing

34:07.880 --> 34:10.240
and, you know, living their lives?

34:10.240 --> 34:12.600
Yes, we have all of that,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.880
but it is still, unfortunately,

34:14.880 --> 34:18.440
just like we're scratching the surface.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.480
And those people still are getting all of that accomplished

34:21.480 --> 34:23.440
literally swimming through molasses.

34:23.440 --> 34:28.440
This is some of the most gross, immoral,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.360
unfair waste of human capital.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.840
And so that is the, started with you as a seven-year-old

34:41.360 --> 34:43.320
asking, wait a minute,

34:43.320 --> 34:48.320
how do amazing people in Europe do this

34:48.320 --> 34:50.560
and the amazing people in Africa don't?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.200
Yeah, and that's a key word, amazing,

34:52.200 --> 34:55.160
because that's what I realized later

34:55.160 --> 34:57.520
because, and it was not always like that for me,

34:57.520 --> 34:59.160
amazing and amazing, right?

34:59.160 --> 35:02.720
I knew instinctively that, of course, we are amazing too.

35:02.720 --> 35:05.480
But so eventually the question became,

35:06.320 --> 35:09.440
how, so I went from, how come they have this and we don't

35:09.480 --> 35:11.880
to the country as I'm growing up and researching

35:11.880 --> 35:13.000
because it stayed with me.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.920
When I tell you I'm obsessed, I'm haunted.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.040
I am haunted.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.560
So you can laugh all you want, but it's,

35:19.720 --> 35:21.960
so the question became,

35:21.960 --> 35:25.080
the question became, how come some countries

35:25.080 --> 35:30.080
like the United States, Singapore are rich

35:30.400 --> 35:35.120
and some others like mine and many others in Africa are poor?

35:35.120 --> 35:37.080
That became the question.

35:37.080 --> 35:41.320
And along the line, like, along the road,

35:41.320 --> 35:43.400
I continued on living my life,

35:43.400 --> 35:44.840
wondering about this question.

35:45.920 --> 35:50.440
And I've heard all types of reasons

35:50.440 --> 35:53.880
as to supposedly why that might be the case.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.160
Some people with a very straight face

35:56.160 --> 36:00.400
are still peddling the IQ theory, according to which,

36:00.400 --> 36:03.040
come on, darling, it's not your fault.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.560
You know, your skin color goes with a gene sequence

36:05.560 --> 36:07.840
that just doesn't allow you to be as smart

36:07.840 --> 36:09.920
as white people are.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.960
And it's not your fault, but just accept it.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.360
That stuff is still out there.

36:14.360 --> 36:15.200
It's very real.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.840
And I have to hear it.

36:17.840 --> 36:21.760
And others would say to me, it's just because, you know,

36:21.760 --> 36:25.520
you guys don't have adequate level of education.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.280
And I say, you know, maybe you gotta go say that

36:29.440 --> 36:33.200
to most of the street sellers you go see in Senegal.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.560
You go up to any of these,

36:34.560 --> 36:37.720
to many of these street sellers in Senegal.

36:37.720 --> 36:41.840
They are wading through cars and moving cars

36:41.840 --> 36:46.840
under the hot sun, fumes thrown at their face,

36:48.200 --> 36:51.840
trying to sell you anything that you think

36:51.840 --> 36:53.440
you might be able to use.

36:53.440 --> 36:56.960
Whether we're talking about an ironing board,

36:56.960 --> 37:01.960
to an umbrella, to Q-tips, to, you know, toothpicks,

37:02.920 --> 37:04.880
selling you whatever you need from your car.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.440
These are street sellers.

37:06.440 --> 37:10.840
And you ask them, dear, do you have any degree?

37:10.840 --> 37:14.520
Yeah, I have this graduate degree in math

37:14.520 --> 37:17.560
or in literature or whatever.

37:17.560 --> 37:20.280
Some very, very educated people.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.520
Yet they're right there, this is what they're doing.

37:22.520 --> 37:27.520
So that's just at scale wasted human potential.

37:28.560 --> 37:29.400
Thank you.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.440
So what has to do, the wasted human potential

37:32.440 --> 37:35.040
has to do now with the system,

37:35.040 --> 37:37.080
with something about the laws.

37:38.920 --> 37:43.640
Something about sort of the things that limit

37:43.640 --> 37:45.760
or enable the entrepreneur.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.000
Yes, because at that point I've heard this.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.600
You know, I heard people say, yeah, your IQ is no good.

37:52.600 --> 37:56.120
No, you don't have enough degrees or you're not educated.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.360
No, some people would even say,

37:57.360 --> 37:58.760
it's because you guys are malnourished.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.440
You're malnourished, you need to be fed.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.840
Others, oh, well, maybe I'll give you some shoes

38:03.840 --> 38:06.040
and maybe something is gonna change, whatever.

38:06.040 --> 38:08.880
And then, so I heard all of this nonsense, Lex,

38:08.880 --> 38:10.680
but guess what, none of them made sense.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.080
You know why it didn't make sense?

38:12.080 --> 38:14.640
Because if any of that crap was true,

38:14.640 --> 38:19.080
why, oh, why is it that my parents

38:19.080 --> 38:22.760
are any other people from these places?

38:22.760 --> 38:24.000
And oh, and by the way,

38:24.000 --> 38:28.120
some people call those places God forsaken land.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.560
That's also the type of crap you always have to hear

38:31.560 --> 38:35.520
when it's not just flat out S-H-I-T, whole countries,

38:35.520 --> 38:38.480
from, you know, one person a few years ago,

38:38.480 --> 38:40.320
president of this country.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.600
That sentiment is sometimes there.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.320
It is, it is.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.520
As I go on with my life trying to find the answer

38:47.520 --> 38:49.240
to why are some countries like mine poor

38:49.240 --> 38:50.240
while others are rich,

38:50.240 --> 38:53.120
I'm hearing all of these reasons thrown at me.

38:53.960 --> 38:57.520
And then they make no sense because then how come then

38:57.520 --> 39:00.320
if my parents move,

39:00.320 --> 39:05.000
as it is usually anyone else who moves from a poorer nation

39:05.000 --> 39:07.120
to a nation that supposedly is rich,

39:07.120 --> 39:11.760
all of a sudden they get to manifest the greatest potential.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.360
So I'm starting to think this has nothing to do

39:14.360 --> 39:16.160
with a person per se,

39:16.160 --> 39:17.680
because we're talking about the same person,

39:17.680 --> 39:21.040
same background, same name, features, everything.

39:21.040 --> 39:22.120
Now I'm starting to think,

39:22.120 --> 39:24.240
maybe it doesn't have to do with the person.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.840
Maybe we're talking about something that has to do

39:26.840 --> 39:28.480
with the place that they came from

39:28.480 --> 39:30.240
or the place that they're going to.

39:31.240 --> 39:34.400
So this little thing is starting to be in my mind.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.760
Again, remember, this is not something

39:35.760 --> 39:37.160
that I woke up to overnight.

39:37.160 --> 39:39.240
I'm like, voila, I got my question.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.400
It took me for a long time.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.200
And I had to, I had to, to face off,

39:43.200 --> 39:45.840
to have many different ideologies face each other.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.640
I had to really have a reckoning literally in my heart

39:48.640 --> 39:49.600
and in my mind.

39:51.040 --> 39:54.360
And so, so then that's what I'm thinking.

39:54.360 --> 39:58.400
It cannot be, no, no, no, it's the same people.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.320
It has to be about the place.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.080
But then what about this place?

40:01.080 --> 40:05.320
But then even about the place, you're thinking,

40:05.320 --> 40:08.040
again, two countries, different backgrounds, same outcome,

40:08.040 --> 40:09.760
same background, different outcome.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.080
What is this?

40:12.080 --> 40:17.080
And then I go on, I start, I am in Silicon Valley

40:17.640 --> 40:22.640
in the late 90s, early 2000s, that come boom, all of that.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.520
And I'm starting to discover this concept

40:26.520 --> 40:28.560
of this thing called entrepreneurship.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.080
You know, I'm in Silicon Valley

40:30.080 --> 40:34.600
and just getting to experience what seems so cliche by now,

40:34.600 --> 40:36.920
but you know, people on the getting together

40:36.920 --> 40:39.200
in the back of a napkin, talking about an idea,

40:39.200 --> 40:40.160
you know, bring it out.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.600
And then they go out and they talk to some

40:41.600 --> 40:43.960
to some of these investors who's gonna invest in it.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.720
Then they have the lawyers who get to, you know,

40:45.720 --> 40:47.200
put all of this stuff together.

40:47.200 --> 40:49.640
And then they have the big four CPA firms,

40:49.840 --> 40:53.040
this whole ecosystem of what they call of entrepreneurship.

40:53.040 --> 40:55.000
And then eventually this concept of entrepreneurship

40:55.000 --> 40:57.760
being this idea of, you know,

40:57.760 --> 40:59.400
creating something out of nothing.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.840
So there I am.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.160
And at some point I become an entrepreneur myself.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.760
And the way I became an entrepreneur was not like,

41:04.760 --> 41:07.320
I woke up and I'm like, I wanna make money.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.760
So I'm gonna become an entrepreneur, you know, like, no.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.120
And this is also another problem I have with people

41:12.120 --> 41:15.200
who have a problem with entrepreneurs or business people.

41:15.240 --> 41:19.920
Most entrepreneurs do not start a business to become rich.

41:19.920 --> 41:22.720
Most entrepreneurs start a business

41:22.720 --> 41:25.120
because they have found identified a problem

41:25.120 --> 41:29.000
that bothered them enough that they said enough is enough.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.560
I'm gonna do something about it.

41:30.560 --> 41:34.680
What entrepreneurs are, are people who criticize by creating.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.920
Do they always get it right?

41:35.920 --> 41:36.760
No.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.600
As a matter of fact,

41:37.600 --> 41:40.520
the failure in entrepreneurship is humongous.

41:40.520 --> 41:45.520
It's kamikaze path to take the entrepreneurship path.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.000
We lose our spouses.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.840
My first husband passed away

41:48.840 --> 41:52.040
as soon as I was about to sign my first term sheet.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.680
And yet I had to keep going.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.440
What force can keep you going

41:57.440 --> 41:59.960
after you just lost the love of your life?

41:59.960 --> 42:01.720
What force keeps you going?

42:01.720 --> 42:04.720
The force of, oh, I just wanna be rich, really?

42:04.720 --> 42:07.160
When your whole world is upside down,

42:08.640 --> 42:10.440
your whole world is upside down

42:11.320 --> 42:12.720
and you just want to quit.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.760
You just want to go meet him and join him in death.

42:16.760 --> 42:17.880
I stayed, why?

42:17.880 --> 42:21.240
Because of the same reason why I started my company.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.440
I stayed because the women

42:23.440 --> 42:26.240
whom I had put back to work by then,

42:26.240 --> 42:28.120
we're talking about some of the most vulnerable women

42:28.120 --> 42:29.440
in my country.

42:29.440 --> 42:31.640
These are women who grow the hibiscus,

42:31.640 --> 42:33.600
which we need to make the bisap,

42:33.600 --> 42:35.680
which is the juice of taranga, remember?

42:35.680 --> 42:38.280
This is our national identity drink.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.360
And for the longest time,

42:39.360 --> 42:40.880
we've grown this hibiscus that we use

42:40.880 --> 42:43.240
for the national drink, for this drink.

42:43.240 --> 42:45.080
And now that Coca-Cola, Pepsi,

42:45.080 --> 42:46.960
and all that had made it through the marketing

42:46.960 --> 42:49.640
that it is more cool to drink those beverages.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.320
Now there is no more market for the hibiscus.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.840
And with that goes the livelihoods of these women.

42:56.080 --> 42:58.560
And for me, that bothered me enough

42:58.560 --> 43:01.000
because in that force, I saw two things.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.760
One was a part of my culture.

43:03.760 --> 43:06.160
We're talking about, I mean,

43:06.160 --> 43:10.200
part of my cultural identity for Christ's sake,

43:10.200 --> 43:11.360
the juice of taranga.

43:11.360 --> 43:12.600
You asked me, what defines you?

43:12.600 --> 43:13.640
I said, taranga.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.920
There's a juice for it.

43:14.920 --> 43:16.840
So my culture is disappearing.

43:16.840 --> 43:17.960
And at the same time,

43:18.800 --> 43:22.960
these women are sliding into abject poverty

43:22.960 --> 43:25.960
because what they used to make, no one needs anymore.

43:25.960 --> 43:30.960
So that is what got me to start a company.

43:31.120 --> 43:34.080
And the company was created just because of that.

43:34.080 --> 43:38.720
I wanted to build a company that would allow me

43:38.720 --> 43:42.680
to not only preserve this very important aspect

43:42.680 --> 43:44.240
of my cultural identity,

43:45.120 --> 43:48.480
and at the same time, put these women back to work.

43:48.480 --> 43:51.520
And maybe it's more difficult to put into words,

43:51.520 --> 43:55.880
but there's a kind of, it's a basic human spirit

43:55.880 --> 43:58.880
where you see the place where you came from

44:00.520 --> 44:03.160
breaking apart in some kind of way,

44:03.160 --> 44:06.520
and you have the entrepreneurial fire

44:06.520 --> 44:08.680
that dreams of helping.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.520
Yes.

44:09.520 --> 44:13.520
And that, sometimes it's hard to convert that into words.

44:13.520 --> 44:15.160
You have to tell nice stories and so on,

44:15.160 --> 44:17.400
but it's the basic human desire to help.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.240
Yes.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.360
And like I said, criticize by creating.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.160
Especially when you've been, especially when,

44:24.160 --> 44:25.240
and let's face it,

44:26.560 --> 44:29.800
do we all, are we all a bundle of circumstances,

44:29.800 --> 44:31.520
some happy, some worse?

44:31.520 --> 44:32.640
Yes, we are.

44:32.640 --> 44:37.160
And oftentimes I ask myself, my God, why you?

44:37.160 --> 44:39.920
Why did you, why did you get

44:40.960 --> 44:43.040
to have the opportunities that you have?

44:43.040 --> 44:45.240
What makes you different from, let's say,

44:45.240 --> 44:50.120
even your cousin that couldn't, that is still home, trapped?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.560
Because we call ourselves trapped citizens.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.280
When you're trapped in these countries that go nowhere,

44:55.280 --> 44:58.200
we're like a bunch of trapped citizens.

44:58.320 --> 45:03.320
So you see, Lex, when my husband passed away

45:03.360 --> 45:05.840
and I wanted nothing more to do than to quit

45:05.840 --> 45:08.320
and to send, investors had already said,

45:08.320 --> 45:10.160
we understand if you want to stop,

45:10.160 --> 45:12.800
whatever you decide to do, we'll do that.

45:12.800 --> 45:14.040
And I wanted to quit.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.480
And I was actually on my way.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.000
I was in Senegal for a month

45:18.000 --> 45:20.600
trying to really get a bearing over myself.

45:20.600 --> 45:25.600
And by the end of the month, I had decided I'm letting go.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.640
There's no way.

45:26.640 --> 45:30.280
The pain was too great, nothing made sense anymore.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.840
It was too much.

45:31.840 --> 45:36.840
So I went to see this woman and I talked to the one who,

45:37.320 --> 45:41.080
we're talking back then, there were 400 of them.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.600
Later on, we grew to 9,000.

45:43.600 --> 45:47.880
And I told the representative of all of them

45:47.880 --> 45:51.240
and I told her, this is very old lady.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.400
And just looking at her,

45:53.400 --> 45:55.000
I knew I was going through some pain,

45:55.000 --> 45:57.680
but this woman has probably gone through 10 times,

45:57.680 --> 46:00.400
not that pain is measurable,

46:00.400 --> 46:02.920
but you could tell this woman probably lost a child

46:02.920 --> 46:05.320
as oftentimes happen in places

46:05.320 --> 46:07.960
that are lower income countries,

46:07.960 --> 46:10.360
probably lost a husband also,

46:10.360 --> 46:12.400
probably, who knows, so many people.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.680
Loss is part of our lives.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.520
You can see the pain.

46:14.520 --> 46:18.160
You can see the pain, yet she's so, so dignified.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.920
She's so dignified.

46:19.920 --> 46:22.200
And that already kind of made me like,

46:22.200 --> 46:23.600
my God, stop crying.

46:23.600 --> 46:27.120
But, and I told her that I was quitting.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.640
I could not look her in the eyes.

46:29.640 --> 46:33.800
And she said, look at me.

46:33.800 --> 46:34.640
I could not look her in the eyes.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.360
I said, she said, look at me, child.

46:37.840 --> 46:40.520
And I looked at her and she said,

46:41.640 --> 46:44.880
you know, I know you're in pain,

46:44.880 --> 46:48.280
but where your husband is, where your beloved is,

46:48.280 --> 46:51.240
there's absolutely nothing that you can do for him.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.120
But for us, you can change everything.

46:54.120 --> 46:55.840
And I went back.

46:55.840 --> 47:00.840
So that's what entrepreneurs are at their best.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.240
Did she helped you find your strength?

47:03.240 --> 47:04.240
Yes.

47:04.240 --> 47:08.320
And I was weak still,

47:08.320 --> 47:11.080
but I said, you put that aside.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.320
There's a job to do here.

47:13.280 --> 47:14.880
And I went back and like,

47:14.880 --> 47:16.960
I fought with everything that I had.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.160
And this company that I started in my kitchen

47:20.160 --> 47:22.560
became this company that had the who's who

47:22.560 --> 47:25.760
of the beverage world with at some point,

47:25.760 --> 47:27.720
Roger Enrico, the chairman of PepsiCo

47:27.720 --> 47:30.400
sitting on my board, on my board.

47:32.480 --> 47:33.320
Yeah.

47:33.320 --> 47:34.480
I went back because of that.

47:34.480 --> 47:37.760
So the reason why I tell this story for me is important

47:37.760 --> 47:40.440
because the world needs to understand

47:43.200 --> 47:48.200
that there is a viable way of caring

47:50.080 --> 47:53.640
and of being part of a solution

47:54.600 --> 47:59.600
for the lesser fortunate in terms of not keeping them

48:00.040 --> 48:02.240
where they are and we're like the savior is coming

48:02.240 --> 48:03.920
and giving them food and all that.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.040
No, no, no, no, no.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.800
But it's like, just like the leg up I got in my life,

48:07.800 --> 48:09.200
give somebody else a leg up.

48:10.680 --> 48:14.040
What are the things you're fighting against in Africa

48:14.040 --> 48:17.400
when you try to build a business like that?

48:17.400 --> 48:19.200
So then we're building this company.

48:20.240 --> 48:24.840
And back then, this was in 2004,

48:24.840 --> 48:26.840
that was when I built my first company.

48:28.800 --> 48:32.320
We had to have two sister companies, one there, one here.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.920
So the one in Africa was about the whole supply chain.

48:36.960 --> 48:41.960
And the one in America was research and development,

48:42.360 --> 48:44.600
sales and marketing, all of that good stuff.

48:45.600 --> 48:48.400
And then at some point I look around,

48:48.400 --> 48:51.320
I'm like, wait a second, here, back in the days

48:51.320 --> 48:53.360
before we had the, you know, like they would talk,

48:53.360 --> 48:55.000
they would say, oh, we have this one stop shop

48:55.000 --> 48:56.360
for business registration.

48:56.360 --> 49:01.360
But the truth is very quickly you can set up an LLC in the US.

49:01.680 --> 49:04.520
We're talking about less than, even then less than,

49:04.520 --> 49:07.760
you know, today's super fast, 20 minutes online, done.

49:07.760 --> 49:11.720
Back then it was, you know, less than a few hours

49:11.800 --> 49:14.680
to get it done, cost you almost nothing.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.240
We're talking about a few hundred dollars,

49:16.240 --> 49:19.360
you know, three, two to 350, depending which state you are.

49:19.360 --> 49:23.840
So LLC, starting a basic company takes almost no time.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.720
No time, no time, no money, almost.

49:25.720 --> 49:29.160
You don't have to know a guy that knows a guy

49:29.160 --> 49:33.280
that slips some money to the politician and so on.

49:33.280 --> 49:35.600
No, none of that stuff, none of that stuff.

49:35.600 --> 49:40.000
And so at the same time, also things like,

49:40.000 --> 49:42.680
and this can take you even to today's day.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.200
Okay, Lex, I don't know if you have employees on payroll

49:45.200 --> 49:50.200
or anything like that, but do you have to go every month

49:50.640 --> 49:52.800
or anybody listening to us right now,

49:52.800 --> 49:56.880
do they have to go every single month

49:56.880 --> 49:59.080
to three different type of agencies,

50:01.880 --> 50:06.880
you know, like governmental agencies to do one step?

50:07.440 --> 50:10.160
This one is basically you're gonna go

50:10.160 --> 50:14.000
and give them your retirement money,

50:14.000 --> 50:16.240
like, you know, like the pension part of the salary

50:16.240 --> 50:18.360
that you took out from your employee.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.080
You have to go to this agency

50:20.080 --> 50:22.040
and put that application through.

50:22.040 --> 50:23.800
So you leave that money behind.

50:23.800 --> 50:25.320
Then you go to another agency.

50:25.320 --> 50:28.360
This one is for their health, you know, care, whatever.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.000
You have three of those places

50:30.000 --> 50:33.560
where you have to literally go to in person.

50:33.600 --> 50:37.720
Three times, three places every single month

50:37.720 --> 50:40.120
to drop off these, you know, these paperwork.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.640
Do you have to do that anywhere in the US?

50:42.640 --> 50:45.520
I mean, do we have that situation anywhere

50:45.520 --> 50:47.160
that you know of right now?

50:47.160 --> 50:48.200
No, no.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.120
And do you think that's business friendly

50:50.120 --> 50:52.160
or do you think it's cumbersome in business?

50:52.160 --> 50:55.200
And that's not just cumbersome sort of physically,

50:55.200 --> 50:57.360
it's cumbersome psychologically,

50:57.360 --> 51:01.920
that there's a feeling like the system around you.

51:01.920 --> 51:03.800
Yeah, there's a feeling like you're trapped.

51:03.800 --> 51:07.240
It's a feeling like the system doesn't want you to succeed

51:07.240 --> 51:09.560
versus a system that does want you to succeed.

51:09.560 --> 51:10.880
Exactly.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.920
You're in a country like, we're in Texas.

51:13.920 --> 51:17.640
If you make less than a million bucks in revenues a year,

51:17.640 --> 51:19.840
you know, all you do, five minutes it takes you,

51:19.840 --> 51:24.440
you're filing, you know, your franchise tax.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.120
That's it.

51:27.120 --> 51:28.240
It's below that number.

51:28.240 --> 51:29.320
Tell them what it is.

51:29.320 --> 51:30.760
Then you have nothing to give them

51:30.760 --> 51:33.200
or anything like that, you move on.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.920
Us, even if I make this much,

51:38.080 --> 51:40.160
there is a minimum tax that you have to pay,

51:40.160 --> 51:42.600
which is $1,000 in Senegal right now.

51:42.600 --> 51:46.520
For the listener, my guy was holding up a zero.

51:47.600 --> 51:49.040
You make no money.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.000
You still have to pay.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.400
You still have to pay.

51:51.400 --> 51:54.800
So, and then, oh, let me walk you through

51:54.800 --> 51:56.560
what happened to me when we had to try

51:56.600 --> 52:00.840
to get electricity hooked up on our first office.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.360
So we go, they say, oh, first you have to apply.

52:03.360 --> 52:05.840
You know, like you normally, you have to apply.

52:05.840 --> 52:08.320
Then we apply, we pay the money.

52:08.320 --> 52:10.080
Remember again, here you have to also go.

52:10.080 --> 52:13.360
This was like, you know, you go to the office and you pay.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.560
And then we wait and we wait and we wait.

52:16.560 --> 52:17.880
And when I say we wait, I'm not talking about

52:17.880 --> 52:20.440
we waited 24 hours, waited 48 hours,

52:20.440 --> 52:25.040
a month, two months, three months, four months, five months.

52:25.040 --> 52:28.800
You go, you send your assistant, she goes, she comes back.

52:28.800 --> 52:30.200
Well, they say we send it to wait.

52:30.200 --> 52:31.840
At some point, I'm like, I gotta go there.

52:31.840 --> 52:34.560
So I go there and I asked to speak

52:34.560 --> 52:38.280
to the head of the district for, you know,

52:38.280 --> 52:41.960
and I'm just like going on and on and on and on

52:41.960 --> 52:43.240
about how we've been delayed.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.320
This is gonna be a problem.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.600
We have to produce, everything is delayed.

52:46.600 --> 52:49.080
And I risk losing my business.

52:49.080 --> 52:53.040
We already pre-sold some of these products to our customers.

52:53.680 --> 52:54.880
Something needs to happen.

52:55.880 --> 52:58.000
So at some point, the gentleman looks at me.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.480
He's like, lady, look over there.

52:59.480 --> 53:00.960
I look over there.

53:00.960 --> 53:03.880
I see a pile of paper this high.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.240
We're talking about maybe hundreds of applications.

53:07.240 --> 53:10.240
Each one of them is a single, single, single sheet.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.280
Each single sheet is an application

53:12.280 --> 53:14.720
for getting the electricity.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.920
And he says, do you see that?

53:16.920 --> 53:17.760
I said, yeah.

53:17.760 --> 53:18.680
And he said, look over there.

53:18.680 --> 53:20.680
I look over there to the other side.

53:20.680 --> 53:22.400
I see two meters.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.280
He's like, each of these applications needs one of those.

53:26.280 --> 53:27.120
How many do you see?

53:27.120 --> 53:28.160
I said, two.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.600
Then I knew I was in trouble.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.640
And then I said, what do I do?

53:33.640 --> 53:37.480
And he said, lady, it's not at our level.

53:37.480 --> 53:38.480
And I agreed with him.

53:38.480 --> 53:40.040
It was not on his level.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.880
But eventually, you know, by now you can tell

53:41.880 --> 53:44.120
that I pretty much get what I need because,

53:44.120 --> 53:46.000
and at that point what I did was not threaten him

53:46.000 --> 53:46.840
or anything like that.

53:46.840 --> 53:47.840
I didn't even pay bribe or anything,

53:47.840 --> 53:50.160
but you could see why people pay bribes.

53:50.160 --> 53:52.080
Because when you have a pile like that,

53:52.080 --> 53:54.000
then the only way to advance your file,

53:54.000 --> 53:56.920
and that, by the way, happens even at the passport office.

53:56.920 --> 53:58.480
You come, you apply for your passport,

53:58.480 --> 54:02.000
which is your right, they forced us to have passports.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.880
It's your right as a citizen to have a passport.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.800
And even there, if you want yours to keep going

54:06.800 --> 54:08.480
through the process, you have to bribe somebody

54:08.480 --> 54:10.720
so it can go even the pace it's supposed to go,

54:10.720 --> 54:11.920
let alone faster.

54:11.920 --> 54:15.200
So here, I'm thinking I have a problem.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.400
And at that point, I did what I do.

54:17.400 --> 54:19.800
I talked to him about all the things I was trying to do.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.440
I explained to him why I'm here,

54:21.440 --> 54:23.000
why I'm trying to do this.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.360
And even him said, lady, someone like you,

54:25.360 --> 54:28.400
you have no reason to even be here.

54:28.400 --> 54:31.000
You could be back in America living your life,

54:31.000 --> 54:32.680
la vie de loca, you don't have to be here.

54:32.680 --> 54:35.280
So that, I think, gained a lot of his respect.

54:35.280 --> 54:38.360
And I said, if you don't do, if you don't help me with this,

54:38.360 --> 54:40.960
I understand, I shouldn't be of a priority

54:40.960 --> 54:42.880
or anything like that, but I beg you,

54:42.880 --> 54:46.480
I beg of you, I need for this to go on this week.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.720
And he said, okay, that's how I got my meter.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.680
One of those two meters became mine.

54:50.680 --> 54:52.560
So then he said, but we have a problem.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.000
And I said, what?

54:54.000 --> 54:57.800
He said, well, the truck, we need a truck to be here

54:57.800 --> 55:00.960
to do it because of where you are from the pole,

55:00.960 --> 55:05.440
we need long cable lines to get it all done.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.880
But the truck is, I don't know where the truck was

55:07.880 --> 55:08.760
because they had this one truck

55:08.760 --> 55:10.680
for I don't know how many customers.

55:10.680 --> 55:12.000
So I go to the mayor of a town

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
with whom I'm quite friends, but you see, I know people,

55:16.000 --> 55:17.440
but it shouldn't be this way.

55:17.440 --> 55:20.440
So I go to the mayor of a town

55:21.280 --> 55:22.840
and I said, mayor, he happens to have the same name as me.

55:22.840 --> 55:25.600
First, last name, same, but except he's the ugly one,

55:25.600 --> 55:27.520
I'm the pretty one because you know, he's.

55:27.520 --> 55:31.000
You know, you know, right?

55:31.000 --> 55:32.320
That's so people can tell you apart.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.160
She's the pretty one.

55:33.160 --> 55:35.920
Exactly, I'm the pretty one and he's the whatever.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.560
So I got to the mayor and I'm like, mayor,

55:37.560 --> 55:39.160
I need your help, you need to help me with this.

55:39.160 --> 55:40.560
He's like, now what?

55:40.560 --> 55:42.360
And I explained to him and he's like, okay,

55:42.360 --> 55:45.520
you can take the truck from the city hall.

55:45.520 --> 55:47.880
I'll tell the guys that they can allow you to have it.

55:47.880 --> 55:50.440
And then they come and then you guys can do this.

55:50.440 --> 55:51.800
And then we arrived there.

55:51.800 --> 55:52.640
Guess what?

55:52.640 --> 55:54.960
I thought I was done, Lex, but I was not done.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.920
Because now the electricity company, by the way,

55:56.920 --> 55:59.240
whom we paid, everything was there.

55:59.240 --> 56:02.600
They've been sitting on our money for nine months by now.

56:02.600 --> 56:06.680
Well, we need a ladder long enough to, you know,

56:06.680 --> 56:08.440
like one of the super, super professional ladders

56:08.440 --> 56:11.200
that normally the electricity companies have.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.280
Theirs was in some other village and they didn't know

56:15.280 --> 56:16.920
if it was going to be back for another three days

56:16.920 --> 56:17.760
or four days.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.720
I said, are you kidding me?

56:20.720 --> 56:21.960
He's like, no.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.320
So I called mayor again.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.480
I'm like, mayor, do you have a ladder?

56:25.480 --> 56:26.840
And I explained and he said,

56:26.840 --> 56:30.840
and that's how I got my electricity hooked up.

56:30.840 --> 56:33.440
Otherwise I probably would still be waiting.

56:33.440 --> 56:36.440
So Lex, you add all of these things together.

56:36.440 --> 56:38.560
And also the fact that in my country, by the way,

56:38.560 --> 56:41.400
the labor laws are so stringent.

56:41.400 --> 56:44.440
Basically you are married to employees for good or for bad.

56:44.440 --> 56:46.120
And some people say, oh no,

56:46.120 --> 56:47.720
you're not married for good or for bad,

56:47.720 --> 56:50.680
except that it will just cost you a lot of time and money

56:50.680 --> 56:52.680
to get rid of any of them.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.240
It doesn't matter if the circumstances.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.360
Do you think I really,

56:55.360 --> 56:57.680
an entrepreneur really needs to hear something like that?

56:57.680 --> 56:58.920
You know, the head of the ILO,

56:58.920 --> 57:01.400
I had an argument with him at the UN

57:01.400 --> 57:04.880
and I said to him, listen, and you listened to me very well.

57:04.880 --> 57:09.880
The reason, if you want to protect employees,

57:10.480 --> 57:12.160
as you claim, everything you're doing

57:12.160 --> 57:13.960
is to protect employees.

57:13.960 --> 57:17.400
A, you know better for human being than I am

57:17.400 --> 57:18.880
in terms of wanting to make sure

57:18.880 --> 57:21.320
that people are treated right and fairly.

57:21.320 --> 57:25.040
But last time I checked, Google, for example,

57:25.040 --> 57:28.480
is not offering their employees chef-cooked meals,

57:28.480 --> 57:31.600
super healthy, anything they want,

57:31.600 --> 57:34.400
feeding them from morning till evening,

57:34.400 --> 57:39.400
having some babysitters, having childcare on site,

57:39.640 --> 57:44.600
all of these perks that come on top of really cozy salaries.

57:44.600 --> 57:46.240
It did not happen because you, the ILO,

57:46.240 --> 57:48.120
told them you have to do this.

57:48.120 --> 57:51.880
It happened because there are enough jobs created around

57:51.880 --> 57:55.200
that now you're in an employee's market

57:55.200 --> 57:58.000
and employers have to fall all over themselves

57:58.000 --> 58:00.920
to attract the best talent among us.

58:00.920 --> 58:02.040
That's how it's done.

58:02.040 --> 58:03.600
And not with your nonsense

58:03.600 --> 58:05.520
that you're imposing me right now,

58:05.520 --> 58:07.480
which the only results you're gonna get,

58:07.480 --> 58:08.800
like in my country,

58:08.800 --> 58:10.720
do you know what we have to show for all of these,

58:10.720 --> 58:12.640
the fact that the Senegalese employees,

58:12.640 --> 58:15.800
the most protected employee on paper in the world?

58:15.800 --> 58:19.440
Well, we're one of the 25 poorest countries in the world.

58:19.440 --> 58:20.800
That's what it got us.

58:23.200 --> 58:26.760
So let's try to untangle this.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.600
So there's a system in place.

58:28.600 --> 58:30.960
There's a momentum with that system.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.800
Like you said, lady, it's not my level,

58:33.800 --> 58:37.280
which is for somebody who grew up in the Soviet Union,

58:38.280 --> 58:42.280
at least echoes some of the same sounds I heard

58:43.400 --> 58:45.720
from people I knew there.

58:45.720 --> 58:48.040
It's kind of this helpless feeling like,

58:48.040 --> 58:50.200
well, this is just part of the system,

58:50.200 --> 58:52.480
this gigantic bureaucracy.

58:52.480 --> 58:55.280
And the corruption that happens,

58:55.280 --> 58:57.480
it's just like the only way to get around,

58:57.480 --> 58:58.920
to get anything done.

58:58.920 --> 59:01.240
And so the corruption grows.

59:01.240 --> 59:03.280
Maybe could you speak to the corruption?

59:03.280 --> 59:08.280
To what degree is there corruption in Senegal and Africa?

59:08.840 --> 59:13.120
And how do we fix it?

59:13.120 --> 59:16.080
So when you said to which degree there is corruption,

59:16.080 --> 59:18.320
I will respond to you the same I respond to people.

59:18.320 --> 59:19.960
I say, yeah, we have corruption

59:19.960 --> 59:23.400
and it's almost as bad as in Chicago, right?

59:23.400 --> 59:27.080
So now what I want people to understand

59:27.080 --> 59:28.880
when it comes to corruption,

59:29.760 --> 59:33.240
because we are misguided with corruption.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.640
We think corruption is the root cause of problems

59:35.640 --> 59:40.640
when corruption is simply a symptom of a deeper root problem.

59:42.200 --> 59:47.200
In this case, if you make the laws so senseless,

59:52.200 --> 59:55.960
meaning, let me give you an example of senseless laws.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.120
Every time I have to import something in my country,

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.320
I have a business, we're making lip balms in this case

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.080
and other skincare products.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.120
Some ingredients I'm able to find in the country

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.000
at the standard that I need in order to remain competitive.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.000
Because for example, our products are sold

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.960
at Whole Foods Market, you can understand

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.600
it's a pretty sophisticated and really,

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.600
you know, they don't just put anybody on the shelves.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.040
But the thing is, it means that on the other end,

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.160
my inputs has to be right.

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:33.040
So out of those, some, we have seven ingredients,

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.440
seven items that need to come from abroad

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.680
to go into the making of this product.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.080
Some packaging and some raw material.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.520
But guess what?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.520
Like for five of them, I am paying a 40% tariff

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.560
and for the other two, almost 70% tariff.

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.880
That I call senseless laws.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.000
These tariffs are senseless.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Yeah, corruption is just a symptom.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.400
They reveal that something is broken about the laws.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.240
Exactly.

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.960
And the laws are, so taxation,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.120
this kind of restricting laws,

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.560
laws that slow down the entrepreneurial momentum.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.000
They do, they do.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.280
Because in this case, when my product comes,

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:20.880
what do people have to do?

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.440
Because every time, if you add 40%,

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.720
you're basically on the other end.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.440
So every time you add,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.680
if let's say my product normally cost a dollar

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.920
and with your 40%, by the time I'm done,

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.680
I had to pay, I had, now it's costing me 140.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.040
By the time it arrives in my warehouse,

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.560
in my manufacturing facility, it's now at 140

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:44.840
because of a tariff I left behind.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.280
That 40% you added to it,

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.000
do you know how much it's gonna add to my final cost

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.240
that once the product is finished,

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.200
I have to sell it to the customer?

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.400
I have to sell it for $1.60 more

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.960
because of that 40 cents extra you took from me

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.920
in order for me at the end of the day

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.560
to have some type of profits

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.960
because profits at the end of the day

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.320
is the blood of a business.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.000
There are two people are misguided.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.840
They say, oh, you dirty, greedy business people.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.280
And it's all about profit, profit, profit, profit.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.600
You know, I belong to this organization called

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:23.120
I'm a board member on the Conscious Capitalism.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.280
It is the largest organization

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.800
of purpose-driven businesses and entrepreneurs.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.120
The type of people I told you about,

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.200
we started our businesses because we see something

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.560
that needs to be taken care of in society.

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.640
Whole Foods Market is one of them.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640
The Container Store, you know,

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.120
all of these companies that are beloved in the US

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:44.840
that you can hear of.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.840
We believe that the end goal of business is purpose.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.560
But in order to do purpose,

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.560
you have to have profits to stay alive.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.120
And the best way for people to think of profits

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:04.040
so that they're not all twisted about it.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:08.400
Lex, if I asked you, what's your goal in the world?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.920
You're probably gonna tell me your dream.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.280
You're gonna talk to me about what you're doing right now

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.240
and how you want to be uniting.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.600
You want a more harmonious world.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.280
You want human flourishing.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.920
That's what you're working towards.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.320
That's what you say to me.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.200
You're not gonna say, well, my biggest goal in the world

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.280
is to produce as many red blood cells as I can.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.080
Except you need to produce those, otherwise no Lex.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.160
And if no Lex, no one working.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:34.000
Yeah.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You know what I mean?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.840
So that's all.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:39.000
So people need to stop with this whole profit.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.480
Do we have some psychopaths among us?

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.800
Yeah, one person of us in this world are psychopaths.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.320
In every field, anywhere you look.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.400
And surely you find that

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.120
in the entrepreneurial world as well.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:50.960
Yeah.

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.840
So we have one person of us who are psychopath for sure.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.240
But do they define the rest of us?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.080
Absolutely not.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.360
And thankfully not.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.960
So let's just be clear on that.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.960
So here, you charge me 40% tariff, which is outrageous.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.120
Then you're forcing me to sell it for $1.60 more

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.840
than my competitor who does not have to go

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.960
through that nonsense because she's an American woman

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.080
who is operating in America

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.240
and she doesn't have that nonsense put on her.

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:18.000
So now I'm on this market competing

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.360
against this woman eye to eye.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.680
So if we're selling the same value product,

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.560
mine costs $1.60 more simply

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.520
because of some stupid rules from back home.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.520
Then guess who is going to stay in business and who doesn't?

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.720
See, they want to talk about equality.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.720
That's the type of equality I want to see.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.160
The playing level, the playing field has to be leveled.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.280
Told you English is my fourth language.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.560
Plus two people talking between us.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:46.640
Maybe we'll have this English thing figured out.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.400
We'll have it figured out.

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.720
So the idea of capitalism,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.560
the idea of conscious capitalism is the thing

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.880
that in large part enables this level playing field.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.960
That's what we want.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.320
So what you're trying to say,

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.400
so here, so when I talked about census laws,

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.320
that's an example.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.040
So when you make the tariff so high

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:11.040
that you're going to render me non-competitive,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.240
then that's where for people who might make sense,

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.120
when the product arrives at port,

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.200
they say, hey, I give you this.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.400
What I give you, maybe it's 10% of the price or 5%.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.080
It's surely not 40%, but you are happy with it.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.600
You have a government official,

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.200
that's what we call a bribe.

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.000
And me, I'm like, hey, I saved myself money

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.480
and also I saved myself time.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.800
But you see, if the laws where you pay 5%

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.000
or even the 10% that I just left behind or nothing,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.760
you come, you pay it, you move on.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.520
Because who has a business of fooling around

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.360
and staying behind?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.880
And no, you do that when it actually makes sense to do that.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.560
So I'm not sitting here telling people

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.520
I engage in unlawful practices in my case,

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.120
because I'm around saying the things I'm saying right now.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.920
So I'm a target.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.160
You have to do things cleanly

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.760
and I believe in doing things that way.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.160
So what I had to do was go to the ask again mayor.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.280
We have a problem.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.520
Whenever he sees me, he's like, now what?

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.400
So I'm like, we've got a problem.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.600
You're best friends now.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.080
So I said, now it's the customs.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:21.120
And he's like, what do you want me to do?

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.520
I said, do you know anybody at customs?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.760
I need a higher up at customs

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.640
because I got to explain to them what's going on here.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:27.920
They all know, of course,

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.560
but I think they're not always maybe understanding

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.480
or maybe they understand.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.800
And in this case, he understood.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.800
So we went and he's like, yeah, I know this is not very,

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.960
they are this.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.440
And I said, what do we do now?

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:44.280
And I saw him going through binders and binders

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.840
in his office, because he's gonna try to go

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:51.560
and look where in the law can we find something

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.560
that can help me escape these rules.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:58.240
And you know, the best he found Lex was,

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.840
oh, well here, see this one.

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.080
If you've been in business for two years,

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.640
then we can allow you,

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.400
there is a special term for it, which French is technical.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.920
We can allow you to bring your raw material,

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.240
but you have to tell us exactly how much you're bringing.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.880
And it has to match your formulation

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:18.800
because you know, they don't want you to bring in more

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.960
that we need and maybe sell some of that

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.000
to the rest of the market

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.160
and they didn't make their money on it.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.080
So there, it means I have to give them my recipe.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.880
Imagine Coca-Cola being asked to give their secret sauce

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.040
to government officials in a country

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.360
that you can't even know what might happen.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.000
Let alone even in business, you don't do that.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.040
I mean, trade secrets are trade secrets.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.520
But here you're asked to be putting it in front

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.640
of some people you don't know where it's gonna go after that.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.120
Because there they get to see, okay,

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:51.120
her recipe calls for X amount of candelilla wax,

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.040
X amount of coconut oil.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.720
Okay, and on top of that,

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:00.400
we have to think about how much porridge might they be or not

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:03.520
because again, we don't want her to buffer it over there.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.480
So you have to get naked in front of them

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.520
in terms of your recipe,

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.760
which might end up only God knows where tomorrow,

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.040
maybe competition or maybe even them.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.560
They start a business and they compete with you

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.640
because we've seen that.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.240
So you have to do that.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.000
And then each time fill out a paperwork,

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.480
get the approval, then it can come in.

01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:21.840
So when it can come in, you don't have to pay that tax.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.040
Oh, and by the way, you have one year,

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.920
one year to make this product and get it out.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.760
And all of it needs to be back out

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.560
because if any of it stays here,

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.200
you're gonna pay the taxes that we held up.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:38.200
So you're basically forced by these senseless laws

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:40.720
to be dishonest.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.960
If you want to succeed.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.720
All of this is so cumbersome

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.080
because it means more paperwork,

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.040
paperwork everywhere, maybe having to disclose your things.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.200
So me in my case, what I did is,

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.120
this person said, okay,

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.960
we're gonna see how we can work with you.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.600
But for the first two years,

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.680
we were more or less in the gray area.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.280
Yeah, so even gray area is good.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.840
Yeah, but what does it mean?

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.200
In a situation like that,

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.280
whenever they wanna mess with you,

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.560
it means they can come and they will look

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.280
and they will find something.

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.680
So it means that every day I'm trying to do business,

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.960
I'm running the risk of being harassed

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.400
and or maybe even put in jail, depending on what it is.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.880
I mean, you're an incredible person

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.720
because it seems like there's two ways to change this.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:34.360
Become president or gain power in the country

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.120
and to try to change the laws,

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.800
which seems really difficult to do.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.160
And the other way is fight through the laws

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.040
and create the business anyway,

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:47.880
build the business community and through that method,

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.880
create a huge amount of pressure to change the laws.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.880
You're totally getting it with your last part

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.440
because this is the other thing.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.480
And this is where I get so upset sometimes

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.480
with my fellow Africans

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.480
because they get so disgusted by what they're seeing, right?

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.200
And they think the answer is to go for politics.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.360
Let's go be president.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.200
Let's go be this.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.020
Let's go be that.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:12.040
And we're gonna change everything.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.560
I see that in the US too.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.000
People thinking that presidents have all this power.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.600
Do you know who has the least power in government?

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.440
The president.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:20.640
I mean, people don't get that.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.640
Your best bet, if you insist on going into politics,

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.400
stick to the local level.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:28.400
That's where all the skeletons are buried and hidden.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.280
That's where you can make the most impact, local level.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.160
I know it's not shiny.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.680
I know it's not exciting, but that's where it's at.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.960
So if you must go into politics, but there's another way.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.160
So in my case, what I do is two things.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.960
I preach and I practice.

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.280
I preach when I'm here talking to you about this,

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:45.400
I'm preaching.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.160
I am sharing with people that is which I found.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.320
And by the way, the answer was there.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.920
I was doing these two businesses,

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.920
realizing the difference in treatment

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.200
of the doing business environment

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:01.040
of the US compared to the doing business environment

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.240
of Senegal.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.520
And at first I was like, of course us,

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.680
everything is messed up.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.520
It's because we're a poor country.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:09.720
But when I started to put two and two together,

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.080
I'm like, you're poor because you have no money,

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:14.760
at least not enough money to take care of your basic needs.

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.760
You have no money because you have no source of income.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:21.160
Where does a source of income come from for most of us?

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.560
It comes from a job, doesn't it?

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:26.240
And then some people, sometimes at my UC Berkeley class,

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:29.120
they say, oh no, it comes from government too.

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.040
I'm like, I would like to think that even if you work

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.520
for government, you're gonna be paid something, right?

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.360
And they're like, yeah.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.840
And then even before I can say something, they're like,

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.840
yeah, because that money we used to pay

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.320
our public officials comes from taxes,

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.320
employers, employees, we go back to the private sector

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.000
for most of it, from where this whole thing is created.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.120
So it's clear, you're poor because you have no money,

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.600
no money because no source of income.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.360
Source of income for most of us is a job.

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.000
We're talking about, so where do jobs come from?

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.040
The private sector, primarily small

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.600
and medium-sized enterprises.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:06.560
Then don't you think that we should make it easy,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.560
that we should have a friendly doing business environment.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.240
And also a lot of it comes not just

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.400
from the small and medium-sized businesses,

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.280
but I think a lot of the value is created

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.360
from new ones being launched.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.200
Yes.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.240
Right, it's not just like me saving somehow

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:31.240
through regulation the ones that are already there.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.560
No, no.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.520
It's like letting the market,

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.520
letting the new, better ideas flourish.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.120
Yes, it's about what I mean by doing business environment

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:45.440
is all the things that you and I talked about earlier.

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:48.720
Even the access of electricity is part of a doing business.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.680
The doing business, so basically when I've discovered

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:54.200
all of that, when I put all of those dots together,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.560
then I'm like, well, I guess the business,

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.040
and it makes sense, Lex.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.760
If you want to grow tomatoes,

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.400
you're gonna have to have two things.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.960
One is a good seed, right, that has good attributes.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.680
And then you're gonna have to have

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.560
a good environment for it.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.440
Is the soil the right one?

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.200
What's your pH level?

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.120
All of those good nutrients that you're gonna put in it?

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.200
Is it in a place that has tons of sun?

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.960
How much sun exposure or not?

01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.520
The climate in general, is it gonna be cold?

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:25.160
You can have some beautiful tomatoes

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.400
in the middle of Siberia, last time I checked.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.760
So same thing here.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:33.120
Mohammed Yunus, the noble laureate for peace,

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.680
said, poor people are bonsai people.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.400
They're the same people.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.880
If you put them in the normal, natural, friendly habitat

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.680
where they can thrive,

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.640
they become the tallest tree in the forest.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:51.400
Poor people are bonsai people.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.440
So you see that tiny pot you put around the bonsai tree?

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:57.920
That's the tiny pot that you created

01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:02.040
by giving me such a hostile business environment

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.080
that basically were put together

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.320
by the set of laws that you have put

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:10.200
that basically I have to jump through as a business person

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.800
practicing business in my country.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:17.800
If you turn that environment into a friendly environment

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.640
where I am not married to my employees,

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.200
I have flexibility of the labor laws

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.920
are simple, straightforward, clean,

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.640
where the tax code is very simple.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.480
It's not worth truckloads of laws.

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.640
Like in my country, it's so complicated.

01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:36.120
You have to hire a CPA, which costs more money.

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.680
And even them tell them, girl, we're gonna make some mistakes.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.880
They don't talk to me like that.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.320
It's, you know, they don't tell me,

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:43.560
girl, they shouldn't, they better not.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.480
But they say, whatever they say.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.320
They say.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.160
I'm scared.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.600
You know?

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:50.720
You know?

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.560
They're like, we're gonna,

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.720
but bottom line is we're gonna make mistakes.

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.480
This thing is so complicated, we're gonna make mistakes.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.960
So which means my ass is on the line.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.040
So anyway, so if the tax code was so simple,

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.560
straightforward, like it is maybe in Texas

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.400
where up till a threshold, you owe me nothing,

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.400
go online, five minutes, fill out your taxes,

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:13.760
you're compliant, keep building your business

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.120
because that's what we need from you.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.880
If you made it so easy and straightforward,

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:20.840
then you know what?

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.760
That's when you get all of these people,

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.760
like what you're talking about, saying, you know what?

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.360
My name is Aminata and I live in the middle

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.080
of nowhere, Senegal, but you know what?

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.520
I've got this great idea for this really hot,

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.840
nice hot sauce that I know the Americans are gonna love.

01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:38.440
I'm hearing that hot sauce is a big thing.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:39.880
Let me bring it to them.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.600
But everything is there for you to jump

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.040
into the ring of entrepreneurship.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.240
You don't have to know someone like my God.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.240
You don't have to even have the ability to sell yourself

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.280
maybe like I can sometimes.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.200
You are someone with a great idea.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.400
You're willing to work hard for it

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.920
and pour everything you've got into it.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.760
Guess what?

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.120
It's there.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.440
You can get into the race.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.280
You can be a dreamer and you can be a dreamer

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.600
in a rural little village and then that has ripple effects

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.960
throughout the entire country, young kids growing up,

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.840
I wanna be the next X, whatever.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.880
And it doesn't have to be the next Steve Jobs.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.120
That seems really far, far away.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.680
It's at all levels.

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:28.680
You create local heroes because representation matters.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.920
And we are so badly in need of that.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.000
And so that's what all the things that have been stolen

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.360
from us as long as things remain the same.

01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.600
So Lex, once I found out that basically at the end

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:45.120
of the day, the answer is economic freedom.

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.400
And that when it comes to that, the indexes,

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.040
economic indexes that measure that,

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.680
whether it's the Dream Business Index ranking

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.440
of the World Bank or the Fraser Economic Freedom Index

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.120
of the Heritage Foundation,

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:58.800
when you look at all of those indexes and others,

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.560
what do they have in common?

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:04.640
One after another, they show you that it is harder

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:07.160
to do business in almost anywhere in sub-Saharan Africa

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:11.120
than it is per se anywhere in Scandinavia.

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.520
So it is telling you that Scandinavian nations,

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.080
that socialist Americans tend to love so much

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.840
and take as an example, over there too,

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.000
they're showing you that they don't understand

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.680
what's going on really in Scandinavia,

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.920
that Scandinavia is more capitalist.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.920
Scandinavian nations are more capitalist

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:30.960
than almost any sub-Saharan African nations.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.120
Ultimately, the political systems actually

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.920
don't even matter nearly as much

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:42.800
as the private sector being able to operate

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.120
the machinery of capitalism.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:47.040
There you go, there you go, there you go.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.960
And it's almost like, like I said,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.640
it's almost like its own little widget within it.

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:54.040
You can have whatever type of society you wanna practice,

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.360
you wanna exercise at whatever level you want to.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:01.040
But if you're serious about becoming a low,

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.480
a middle to high-income nation,

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.600
there is no other pathway that we know of at this point.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.160
And you know what made me super excited about that

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.080
beyond having finally found my answer.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.560
I have to tell you, when I found that answer,

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.040
I literally fell to my knees.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:23.120
It was the type of feeling that,

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.200
you know, if something is not well with you,

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.320
whether it's physical or mental,

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.680
something is not well, you're not well.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.440
And you go around and you go to the so-called specialists,

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.120
some of them, you know, but you're going around for years,

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.800
going around trying to get help for your ailment.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.640
And here they don't know.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.440
Here they tell you things that you can't tell why,

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.280
but you just know it's not true.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.880
There this, there that,

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.280
and it's going on for years after year after year.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.280
And finally you meet this one person and boom, it's there.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.120
There.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.800
Not only the liberation,

01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.760
but also this whole new world that comes with it.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.760
You know, I'm still ill, but guess what?

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.520
There's a path forward.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:16.160
We know that.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.920
I'm going to have a lot of work to do, but there's hope.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:20.760
Yeah.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:23.800
And you're the beacon of hope actually

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:25.760
for a lot of people in that part of the world.

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:28.280
And those beacons are actually really necessary.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:32.560
So not only is there hope, but you can become,

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:37.560
I mean, the beacon for your people, your home,

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.880
this power that you see, that you feel all around

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.880
to become, to escape the feeling of being trapped.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:51.280
Is there a device you can give to people that,

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:56.280
to young girls and boys dreaming somewhere in Africa

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:58.960
of how to change the world?

01:19:58.960 --> 01:19:59.800
That's right.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.080
And by the way, I want to say there are bigger beacons,

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.200
there are better beacons than me.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.960
I just happen to be someone who has the chance

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:10.360
of talking to you right now.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:14.560
And one of my goals is to open the same doors

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.560
that were opened for me, because together, our voice,

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:21.320
there's such amazing stories out there.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:26.320
And so bigger beacons, better beacons out there.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.440
One thing here for me, the reason why I do

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.800
what I'm doing right now, and it's almost to the point

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.960
of self-destructing my own health, I feel invested

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:44.560
with such the mission of I have been afforded the truth.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.960
So it is my moral duty to try to take it around.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:49.120
I know I sound, people sometimes they say,

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.760
when I listen to you, I feel like I'm talking to a priest.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:57.600
And I'm like, because the gospel, I receive the gospel.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:00.400
So anyway, but the thing is, Lex,

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.920
who tells you these things to this day?

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.760
When they talk about the poverty of Africa,

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.960
what do they talk about?

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:07.960
They sit in front telling you,

01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.320
oh yeah, it's because of colonialism,

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.040
it's because of racism, it's because of imperialism,

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.160
it's because they're stealing raw material,

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.360
blah, blah, blah.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Is any of those guilty to some level of where we are today,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.320
maybe part of a reason where we are today?

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.240
Maybe, maybe.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.880
Is that the only reason or the overwhelming reasons?

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:30.920
No.

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.400
Is that insurmountable?

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.840
Absolutely not.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:36.360
So for me, don't stay in that place

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.600
that steals and robs you of your agency.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.600
So I think it's important for people to A,

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.160
to get the right diagnosis as to why we are where we are.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.360
Because what you and I just talked about,

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:51.000
the mainstream does not talk about this

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.920
when they even talk about Africa

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.960
in terms that are not the usual suspect of,

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.960
oh, famine is building over there,

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.000
war is building over here,

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.160
oh, we're having Ebola is coming, all of that stuff.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:03.160
Even when they were talking about the monkeypox,

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.920
which at first, in this wave,

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.000
it started with white people in Europe.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.200
Well, even in the many newspapers you pull out,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:14.040
it's black people with monkeypox on their skin.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.320
I'm like, wait a second, this time around,

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.440
it did not start with us.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.240
So why are you always showing us

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.280
when it's right now happening to white people?

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.480
So all of that is happening.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.760
So for me, the thing is,

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.760
we, the world simply right now

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.480
does not have the right diagnosis

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.640
as to why this continent right now,

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.560
despite all of its riches,

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.320
because Lord knows it's got riches

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.560
starting with its young population.

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.440
75% of the population in my country

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.680
is below the age of 25 years old.

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:45.520
So when we're talking,

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:48.000
I know we're talking about, you know,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.960
repopulation, you know, is important.

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.560
We're gonna have to go for that.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.040
Maybe you'll get me going about climate change,

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.440
I don't know, but anyway.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.760
So here, my point is,

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.240
A, we need the right diagnosis

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.560
as to why this continent

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.280
is the poorest continent in the world,

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.080
despite its riches starting with its young people,

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.480
all the natural resources,

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.880
diversity in land, people, cultures, languages,

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.920
everything that make,

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:15.720
that make for great ingredient for awesomeness.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.920
Despite all of that,

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.640
we are the poorest region in the world.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.880
People need to know that the reason why that is,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:24.000
it's because we also happen to be

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.800
the most overregulated region in the world.

01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.840
At the end of the day,

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:32.400
what Africa, and I dare to say Africa here,

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.360
and treat it as one,

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.560
we are 54 countries, 55, depending on how you count,

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.560
yet we almost, for a tiny minority of these countries,

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.400
we almost all lack one of the most crucial freedoms

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.600
that there are.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:52.040
If you're serious about prosperity building,

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:54.640
we lack economic freedom.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.120
And economic freedom is the thing

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.960
that unlocks that human potential,

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.040
the young people just-

01:23:59.040 --> 01:23:59.880
Yes.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:03.480
For them to run, to run with their ideas,

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.680
to start businesses or to start initiative.

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.240
It doesn't have to be for-profit all the time, right?

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.000
But it is this thing that gets you to get up

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.160
and go and do something,

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.360
criticize by creating.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.960
Young people are naturally wired

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:19.640
to wanna criticize by creating.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.240
They're not sitting around waiting or complaining usually,

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.600
unless you put them in a tiny box

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.120
and they have no other way to go.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.320
And in this situation, what they do,

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.560
let's talk about pre-colonial Africa,

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.440
of four favors before slavery ever happened.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.360
They were black people on the continent.

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.680
You see, when we talk about the story of black people

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.960
and Africans, you know, black people in Africa,

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:43.680
for most of us, even me,

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.920
I noticed that unconsciously it starts with slavery.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.120
But you're like, no, we were there before,

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.520
before white men ever set foot.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.360
Who were we?

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.440
What were we doing in our diversity?

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:59.440
What economic systems were we running on?

01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.360
And then you realize that for most of them,

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.000
free marketeers, and they were very much on the free trade,

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.720
on the free enterprise side.

01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:07.680
So even that is a reinforcement.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:12.200
This is a place where we do not understand our history.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.600
So proper diagnosis,

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.320
Africa is the poorest region in the world

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:18.680
because it happens to be the most over-regulated region

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:21.200
in the world, lacks economic freedom.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.920
Number two, what do we do about that?

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:26.320
We gotta become serious about reforms, economic reforms,

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.280
so that we can become beacons of free markets.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.360
Just like the Asian tigers,

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.880
that's what the Asian tigers did.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.200
They had to become serious.

01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.640
Singapore, Taiwan, you know, South Korea,

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:43.920
those guys had to become serious about the free markets.

01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:47.360
Lee Kuan Woo, you know, when, you know,

01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:49.600
he's just like, we gotta do something.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.760
And he looked around and he realized at some point,

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.080
we gotta make these reforms.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.040
And he went on to that journey of reforms,

01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.080
making his country one of the most free market,

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.720
you know, countries in the world.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.480
The magic happened.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.240
Back in the, you know, in the 30s, the stock market crash

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:08.480
and the Great Depression and everything,

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:11.720
the world, and with all the lies that were told

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:15.440
to the world coming from the Soviet Union, Stalin,

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:17.800
while they were starving and dying over there,

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.240
but, oh no, you know, I mean,

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:21.080
Durante was telling the world that,

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.560
oh no, no, everything is going well.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.520
Nobody's dying when we know now,

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.840
and getting police surprises based on this stuff.

01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.440
But then the world went on believing that,

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.960
oh no, capitalism failed.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:36.960
This is, you know, crash that you had in the stock market

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.200
is proof this is what late-stage capitalism produces.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.280
You guys always have your big ups and downs,

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.080
but at that time, it was so hard on people

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.680
that they're like, we're done with this.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.560
And at the same time, we were told the lies

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.400
coming out of the Soviet Union,

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:52.200
but supposedly the communism was doing just fine.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.680
And you're at the point where

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:55.560
the free market concept almost died.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.840
And it's the, you know, the Asian tigers

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.560
who kind of helped, you know,

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:04.520
bring that idea back to life, right?

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.920
Their success having used the free markets.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.120
And so for me, we gotta have,

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.280
we gotta make a new commitment to the free markets

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.520
on this continent if we wanna go anywhere,

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.680
if we wanna go anywhere.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:18.720
And the timing is perfect because the young people,

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.760
there's a, there is a kind of freedom

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.800
for the revolutionary free markets in this whole space.

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.640
Exactly.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.040
And by the way, you said something, oh, say that again,

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.840
because I wanna tell you what I'm hearing in that

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.760
because something's really cool.

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.000
Say it again, come on, Lex.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.520
I don't know which part, English is my second language too.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:39.760
No, you said, you said there's something revolutionary

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.520
in that, because you know how young people

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.240
are attached to the revolution and how, you know,

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.720
I understand, look, look, Lex,

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.480
I understand and I am willing to give the benefits

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.480
of a doubt to some of these socialists who came to it

01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.760
because they had to witness some of the horrors of,

01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:03.360
you know, of their times, you know.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.240
There's a revolution right behind that.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.920
It's ultimately criticized by creating.

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:09.760
Exactly, exactly.

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.720
But violent revolution is never the answer.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.240
But that's what they went for in 1789 in France,

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.280
you know, the French Revolution and then, you know,

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:19.320
Marx and Engels, you know,

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:22.240
they're promoting these ideas that usually for them

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.120
justifies violent revolution.

01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:25.520
Lenin, all of these people,

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:30.080
I am with them when they say that they want

01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:32.080
to see equal rights for people.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.480
Of course, I don't agree with their,

01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.040
therefore we need to push for equal outcomes.

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:39.440
Equal rights is right, but equal outcomes is not right.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.120
So, but I am with them for all the way to equal rights,

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.840
but this is where the two paths go this way.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.280
And also the fact that they have no issue

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:53.200
with violent revolution, that people get killed,

01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:56.280
you know, people get put in gulags and people get,

01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.600
that's not right.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.880
So what you just said here, just give me goosebumps

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.960
because there is revolution in the free markets,

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.800
but that's the type of revolution we want.

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:07.280
The revolution that comes from people creating,

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:08.440
criticizing by creating,

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.560
it's one of the best forms of revolution.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.400
If you ask me,

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.840
that's the most sexy way of revolution,

01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.400
criticize by creating, by what?

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.560
You're gonna go shoot people or be like,

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.480
what's his name?

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:24.160
The Che Guevara who tells you, I love, it's in writing,

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:28.880
I love nothing more than to fry the brain of a man

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.840
with his gun, really?

01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:35.680
Well, in terms of sexy, there is power in that message

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:40.320
of the oppressor, the abuser, the enemy

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.280
that has abused their power, they need to be destroyed

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.680
and there's power in the message of that violence.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.480
Unfortunately, the lessons of history show

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:53.160
that the violence, one doesn't work,

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.960
but it does the following.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.480
There is something about human nature,

01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.600
as the old cliche goes, that power corrupts

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.680
and absolute power corrupts absolutely,

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:05.600
is the people who are in charge of committing that violence,

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.800
it does something to their head.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.960
The first person you kill, the second person you kill,

01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:13.960
for some reason you lose your ability,

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.160
the compassion for other humans.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.600
Even if you began as a revolutionary,

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.360
as the Soviets did, fighting for the worker,

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.560
for the rights and the basic humanity

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.560
of the people that really do the work,

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:33.680
you lose the plot somehow because of the violence.

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:36.680
So in that way, it seems like the lesson,

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.800
at least of this part of the human history,

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.280
until the robots take over,

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:45.280
is that the economic freedom free markets

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:50.600
and protecting those and allowing anyone from your country

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.480
to dream and to make that dream a reality

01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.480
by creating it with as few sort of roadblocks as possible.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.680
Exactly, so that's why for me,

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:07.720
the message is very clear, is what we talked about today.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.720
The reason why Africa is the worst region in the world

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.280
is because it happens to be the most over-regulated region

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.200
in the world, and for some people who might be put off by it

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.720
because they're like, oh, she's talking about laissez-faire.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.960
No, let me put it maybe in a way that you can understand.

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:28.320
Do you think that it should be as easy

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:30.040
for any person in Africa,

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:32.120
for any entrepreneur in Africa to enterprise,

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.320
than it is for any person in Scandinavia to enterprise?

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.160
If your answer is yes, which I would hope it is,

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.080
then you have a moral obligation to work with me

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.280
to make my country and as a whole my continent

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.480
more free markets.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.400
It's that simple.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:51.400
At that point, there's no like, yes,

01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:53.760
but on the other hand, uh-uh, no.

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:54.800
And it's for me on that question,

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.240
and I yet have to find somebody who claims to say no.

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.440
If you say no, then we have a whole nother problem.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.280
I'm not even talking to you at that point anymore.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.120
So, yeah.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.320
So it's just to clarify, you know,

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.880
there's a perception and some reality

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:10.240
that Scandinavian countries have elements of socialism

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.800
in their politics, in their society,

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.360
in their, even in their economics.

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:18.640
So at the very least, Africa should have,

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.280
in terms of economic indices,

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:24.720
should be as free as the Scandinavian countries.

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.000
You're just giving that example.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.120
Economically free, yes.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.720
Because see, the Scandinavian,

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:33.720
they do have a subsidized, you know, like welfare system.

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.600
That's what a small socialized welfare system,

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.200
but the way they make their money

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.440
is very much the way of the free markets.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:43.200
So there is how you make your money,

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.680
and then there's how you maybe decide

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:49.040
as a country to redistribute it, right?

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:54.200
And so even there, even in Scandinavia,

01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:56.560
again, yes, they have more economic freedom.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.560
So then from their legs, where we go is,

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:04.560
my job and my goal is for every single African,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
young and old, to know what I have come to learn.

01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.320
We are not doomed.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:18.640
It's not over for us.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:21.240
We will never catch up.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:23.600
The time for catch up is gone.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:24.800
But guess what?

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.640
We've got a strong, strong possibility

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:32.240
and chance to leapfrog, and leapfrog we will.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:34.440
It is still time.

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.240
But for that to happen, like I said,

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.240
we need to know what we just talked about today,

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:40.560
because that is not what the mainstream

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.960
keeps us abreast with.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:43.880
When you go to the World Bank,

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.520
they don't necessarily work along these lines.

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:51.360
They're still, it's not, when you go to universities,

01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.640
I will ask you, MIT, the MIT econ department,

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.080
or even most of the professors,

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.320
are they free market oriented?

01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:01.120
We find that oftentimes in academia,

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.880
there is a strong anti-capitalist bias.

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.960
There is a strong anti-free market bias.

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.880
So this is a problem.

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.840
This is a problem.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.840
Nobody cares about the economists anyway.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:14.400
Yeah, so we move forward.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.880
In MIT, the spirit of the entrepreneur burns bright.

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.040
Not in the economics department,

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.960
because they just write op-ed articles,

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:26.400
but in the dreamers, the young undergrads

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.000
that actually build something.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:28.840
No, I get that.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:32.440
But then we cannot be stifling their efforts

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.360
by putting these artificially made regulations and laws

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:39.200
that stand in the way and clip their wings.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.400
So that's why when you were saying,

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.200
what advice do you give to them?

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.160
The advice I give to them is each one of them,

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:51.560
they have to pay attention to this discourse we just had.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.440
I don't ask anybody to agree with me on face value.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.160
Go back, do like I had to do.

01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:58.640
I come very much from the left of the left,

01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.920
if you can believe that.

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.400
But I had to have my own intellectual journey.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.280
And in this case, my intellectual journey

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.120
was very much complemented by my own life,

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.640
having to build these companies on two separate continents

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:17.200
and having to, I had front row seat of the differences.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.120
At first, I thought it was this way just because we're poor

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:22.720
and therefore we messed up and therefore it's like this.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.440
But eventually I learned that, no,

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.320
we're poor because we lack economic freedom

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:28.120
and if the country allows its citizens

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.880
the economic freedom to enterprise,

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:31.520
then they become rich.

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.560
So yeah, I had it upside down, you see.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.440
And so it's important for people to know that.

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:38.320
So number one, know your facts

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:41.760
because your facts will empower you.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.600
In this case, I like to use that word.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:46.160
Facts will empower you and they will even furthermore,

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.320
they will power you, empower and power you.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:50.800
Because empower is like inside

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:53.800
and power is like I push you forward and up.

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.880
So that's what it does to know the facts.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:00.440
And then go on and look around you.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.600
Where are the best practices of this?

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:05.800
Who is at the cutting edge of a free markets?

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.160
Where it's done in a way where

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.480
people don't necessarily be left behind

01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:12.000
or anything like that.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.760
We're in 2022 for Christ's sake.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.880
We don't have to do entrepreneurship

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.880
the same way maybe it was done 50 years ago,

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.400
100 years ago when as a community, as a people,

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:23.280
we were maybe less enlightened because of our times.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:26.440
We can update this thing and move forward.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:29.600
But update is definitely not build back,

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:30.440
what do they call it?

01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:33.440
Build back new or whatever they're calling it at the WF.

01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:36.680
Whatever nonsense and stuff they're smoking over there.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.520
It's not that.

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:39.720
There are some principles that are universal

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.920
and that stand the test of time.

01:36:41.920 --> 01:36:45.120
Those we have to keep and on top add

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:49.480
the new things we learn from our times and from life.

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.600
So that's what I want them to know.

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.960
Learn your facts, be empowered, empowered

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:57.240
and then look around, think about the,

01:36:57.240 --> 01:36:59.960
and look to see where the best practices

01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:02.640
are around the world because the world is yours.

01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.760
You might be African, but the world is yours.

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.320
So stop this nonsense of,

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.880
oh well, it's done by white people

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:09.200
so we're not gonna do it.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.040
Get the best that exists in humanity

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.200
for what you're trying to solve.

01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.240
And on top of that, put your own twist, right?

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:22.520
Bitcoin is all of ours to take.

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.240
Bitcoin is not the white man's thing.

01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.560
So therefore, oh, come on, you know,

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.280
because you know, we have a misguided pride.

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.480
We're not gonna use Bitcoin because it's white man's stuff.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:31.040
Bitcoin is math, you idiot.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.280
Math is universal, so it belongs to all of us.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.280
There's no color.

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.120
Exactly.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:38.240
In the space of economics.

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.880
Yeah, in the space of economic ideas.

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.760
And there's a chance to leapfrog too.

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:43.600
Exactly.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:44.960
Which is really, really powerful.

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.720
Exactly, because here we will leapfrog

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.400
and let's, I'm not crazy.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:50.840
This is gonna happen.

01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:52.640
You mark my words.

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.040
But it's gonna happen if as many people

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.840
hear what we're talking about today.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:38:00.280
Because at some point, the solution is not gonna come.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.400
It's not me.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.800
It's not, it's gonna come from the wisdom of the crowd.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.000
This is why I love the crowd.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.640
There's no better wisdom than the crowd

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.680
and that's also why I believe in the free markets.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.560
This concept of emergent order.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:15.480
There's no way, there's no central planning

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.440
that is smart enough, that has the level of intel

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:20.600
that street level people have.

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.000
Trying to create something.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:24.800
It's just, we just have to be humble.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.600
There's just something at the bottom of a pyramid

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.840
that just bubbles up and happens.

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:31.480
They're the best.

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:34.720
I think the cynicism, the idea that people are dumb

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.000
is at the core of a lot of things

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.200
that prevent the flourishing of society.

01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:42.480
You know, this kind of anecdotally,

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.440
people are like, everyone's stupid

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.080
and people say that jokingly.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.680
But the reality is, people are incredible.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:53.280
They have the capacity for kindness, for love,

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:57.640
for innovation, for brilliance in all kinds of dimensions.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.760
You might suck at math,

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.200
but you might be amazing at carpentry.

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.520
You have to find that thing and there's something about

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.440
when there's freedom to find that thing

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:10.160
and people interact, they get excited about shit together

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.040
and then they build.

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:14.760
If you look at authoritarian,

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:18.560
at places that limit that freedom,

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.400
at the core, I think, is the idea that people are dumb.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.160
Let us take care of everything.

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.280
We'll come up with the rules and the regulations

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.000
because people are too dumb to manage things themselves.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.040
And then that idea builds on top of itself

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.840
where you think that the entire populace

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.640
is much lesser than the wise sages sitting at the top.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.240
Then you add violence on top of that

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.640
and that leads to corruption,

01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:46.840
to corrupting of just the human mind of the leaders.

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:49.800
The whole thing becomes a giant mess.

01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.520
The antidote to that is economic freedom.

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.440
For people to have the freedom to enterprise.

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:01.560
Look, Lex, when we allow for that to happen,

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:02.800
have you looked around lately

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.040
and look at the level of niche

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:08.040
that has happened in this country?

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.400
I mean, you have clubs where,

01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:13.320
you have places where people are into guitar strings,

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.840
like some of them, it's all about guitar strings

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.840
and others it's all about these best cupcakes

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:23.600
and others it's all about this new crypto thing over here

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:28.080
and others like hair, best weight.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:33.080
It's when you allow us because seven billion geniuses,

01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:36.800
each one of us I believe came to this world

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:41.600
with something, something that only he or her possesses.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.080
And that is the genius

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.400
and it is their contribution to the human problem.

01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:49.480
When you think about your identity today,

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:52.080
so it all started in Africa,

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.320
just like it did for the entirety of the human species.

01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:57.120
There's a bit of European flavor in there,

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.920
a little French, Silicon Valley,

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:05.120
you're now in part a Texan,

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.480
there's, you really are an American,

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.080
but you're also an African.

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:13.760
Who are you when you look in the mirror,

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.040
when you think about yourself,

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.560
when you listen, when everything gets quiet

01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:20.440
and you listen to your heart, who are you?

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.000
Can you figure out that puzzle?

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:25.160
That's a very interesting question

01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:30.160
because it's been a long time I haven't asked myself.

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.360
I have before.

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:36.600
What I have found is,

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:44.600
I think who I am today has been for sure shaped by,

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.040
I call it Dakar, Paris, San Francisco,

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:52.520
Dakaris, Senegal, Paris, France, and San Francisco primarily.

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.120
And now, yeah, I think I might wanna ask

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.160
there's a little bit of Texan in there.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.200
How do you say, to me,

01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:00.200
to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me,

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.200
to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me, to me,

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.720
a little bit of Texan in there.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.240
How do you say Texas in French?

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:09.720
Texas, Texas, Texas.

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.680
Yeah, Austin, Texas.

01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.040
Austin, Texas, Austin, Texas.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:15.680
It's easy.

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:16.680
Not quite as good as Texas.

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:17.800
Austin, Texas.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.720
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.160
Us, Texas, us, Texas, yeah.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.000
So,

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.200
you,

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:30.320
I was formed by those three.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:35.320
I have to say that what I enjoy from my Senegalese roots

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:40.520
are our commitment to peace, love, and tolerance very much.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:46.360
And Taranga, obviously.

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.520
And I like that it's a culture

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.600
that's very much about reverence.

01:42:53.640 --> 01:42:54.840
We're big on reverence.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.760
I don't think you could ever hear me

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.720
tell an older person,

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.000
especially not my parents or my grandma

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.280
or anybody like that,

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:07.160
for us to be able to tell an older person,

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.880
that's not true, or you're lying,

01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.520
would never cross my mind

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.920
because that's the most disrespectful thing

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:13.760
you can think of,

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.800
the most irreverent thing you can think of.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.120
It doesn't mean that you have to agree

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:19.280
with everything that's said,

01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:21.920
but there is a way to disagree.

01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.480
There is a way to push back

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:25.760
that doesn't have to rob this person

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:26.960
who happens to be older than you,

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.720
especially from the dignity

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.040
that older age normally provides.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:33.760
And there's wisdom to their words

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:36.360
that you yourself may not see.

01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:39.240
So the reverence is for the idea of wisdom,

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:40.360
of tradition.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:42.600
Exactly, exactly.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:47.040
And again, so that is something that I really enjoy,

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.080
especially in something I'm very attached to to this day.

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.960
And then from France,

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:56.640
what I really came to enjoy, of course,

01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.200
is all the fineness

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:02.160
that one can find within French culture.

01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:03.400
The fineness?

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.440
Yeah, the fineness.

01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.800
Foods.

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.000
You mean like the intricacies,

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:08.840
like the very...

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.680
Yeah, the sophistication in there.

01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:14.160
I mean, French lingerie, for example.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.120
I mean, la dentelle, the laces, all of that,

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:22.640
super, it's exquisite.

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:23.600
So the-

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:24.720
Fashion, the food.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:26.080
Fashion, the food.

01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.560
I mean, there's something to be said about all of that.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.520
And it's very beautiful.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.720
And I love also, even when I talk about fineness,

01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:34.800
it's like a meal is not about like this big thing

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.080
we put in front of you.

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:39.240
But you know, smaller portions enjoy what you're eating

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:40.320
and spend time at a table.

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.440
Like the eating time is not necessarily

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.320
just this function of feeding yourself,

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.520
which I understand it,

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.640
but for, this is something that they share

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:51.600
with Senegalese culture,

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.280
is eating is a moment of communion.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:58.040
It's a moment of friendship, family.

01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.640
It's a precious moment.

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:03.880
To this day, and my husband is American,

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.280
we eat our meals together all the time.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.200
I would not have it any other way.

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:11.200
And there's a prep time, all of that stuff.

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.920
It doesn't matter how busy I am, but we're doing it.

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.120
Actually, to push back a little bit, it's interesting,

01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.360
because yeah, the camaraderie over a meal

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.200
is a beautiful thing.

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.000
I got, I mean, I was in a pretty dark place,

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.520
because on the way to Ukraine, I traveled to Paris,

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.360
I stayed in Paris,

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:30.640
and I wasn't able to enjoy the fineness,

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.680
because it was almost a distraction

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.440
from the humanity, for some reason, to me,

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.280
because there's such a focus on the art of it all,

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.640
that you lose the basic connection to humanity.

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:44.360
Now, that said-

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.360
Depends what you're talking about.

01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.800
I think some of the lack of connection over humanity

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:50.080
was the fact that,

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:52.720
while I did know how to speak French for a long time,

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:55.320
I forgot most of the language.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.160
And so part of it, there is a barrier,

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.640
you said hospitality.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:03.400
There is a bit of a barrier in French culture

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.000
to where in order to be welcomed in,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.440
you have to hear the music

01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:12.240
and be able to play the music of the people.

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:16.480
And if you don't, there's a bit of a barrier.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.000
I must admit on that, and that it is true,

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.680
you would feel less that

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.120
if you were with a group of Senegalese people, per se,

01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:27.520
or I would even say if a group of Spanish people.

01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:31.720
And I think this is maybe the other side of it

01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.560
for the French people.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.200
They can be a little bit, you know, up there.

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:38.360
And I think maybe that's what you're sensing there.

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:40.320
If you don't have the codes,

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.920
which is what you call the, if you don't sing the music,

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.440
then it's hard for you to be part of it.

01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:48.640
But I was speaking here from the standpoint of you're in.

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:50.360
Yeah, from the inside.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:51.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.800
Also, come on, come on.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.000
Coming from Texas and also Ukraine,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:58.560
Ukraine, I should say, some of the best steak and meat

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.640
I've ever had, cheap.

01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:03.200
Texas, some of the greatest,

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.000
and the size of the meals in France,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:08.520
it's like, what are we doing here?

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.840
I mean, I get it's art.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.880
I like to look at my art on the wall.

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:14.720
No, okay.

01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.560
And then eat my damn steak.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:19.000
Did you go, so maybe, okay, no, no, no, no.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.320
Okay, now here I have to defend them

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.160
although sometimes I'm the worst.

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.440
No, did you go to some Michelin star restaurant?

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.280
Maybe that's why.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.120
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.640
That's why, because next time you go to France,

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.640
I'll take you to the countryside or any French home.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.080
They will serve you multiple times.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.280
I mean, by the time you're done,

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.240
even if the portions are smaller,

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:44.080
they're smaller if you want to,

01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.040
but because that way you get a chance to really,

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.680
feel what you're eating and then have more

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.640
and then all that stuff, but not be like this.

01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.920
And then, you know, but no, you'll eat plenty,

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.000
but it's because you went to the Michelin's places

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:55.840
where they're like.

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.800
I'm sure the warmth of the people is there.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.600
It's almost makes me sad that sometimes,

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.480
I think to properly be in a place,

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:04.800
you really should spend a long time there.

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.640
Yeah.

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.680
And also be emotionally ready.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:09.400
Again, I was emotionally unavailable.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:10.240
I was just like.

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.440
Well, I would imagine on your way to the Ukraine,

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:13.240
I'm like, who can think about food?

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.240
But in your identity, a bit of Texas,

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:18.480
a bit of San Francisco.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.600
A bit of Africa.

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.680
And I guess from America,

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:28.040
the defining thing for me for America is,

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:33.040
it's the freedom and the entrepreneurial mindset.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.920
See, very quickly when I moved from France

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.480
to the United States,

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.600
and I started becoming successful in the United States,

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:42.520
I found myself, me and my husband,

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:45.920
he was French and my first husband who passed away.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.240
We found ourselves at some point,

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:50.560
we stopped talking to our friends in France

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.200
who stayed in France

01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:55.880
because we were talking to them about things

01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.400
that were so outside of their comprehension.

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.320
What do you mean you're in your 20s

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.440
and you just raised,

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.720
I don't know, a million dollars or $2 million,

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.880
especially from back in those days.

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:13.560
Today, it's easy here and there.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:14.560
So even in France,

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.800
that entrepreneurial spirit didn't burn quite as bright.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:19.560
I mean, don't take me wrong.

01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.480
Do you have some entrepreneurial people in France?

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:23.840
Yeah, but to the level that you have it in the US,

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:24.960
absolutely not.

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.080
It's just, I mean, in France, it's still very much,

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.560
you're born in this area,

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.000
you go to school in that area,

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:32.240
your parents live around,

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.040
eventually you'll marry and be where your parents are,

01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:38.240
or maybe go to where your spouse's parents are,

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:40.680
and you buy your house and you buy it once

01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:42.600
and you're not gonna do like the Americans,

01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:44.720
two years later I sell my house, I go somewhere else.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:45.560
You don't have any other,

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.960
what do you mean, like just stopping from nowhere,

01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:50.360
you're gonna do what?

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.640
Start a business and you have nothing to back you up

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:53.480
or whatever.

01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:57.760
Oh, and even this idea of going and fundraising,

01:49:57.760 --> 01:49:59.720
this venture cap, especially back in the days,

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:02.040
venture cap, all of that, it's very American.

01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.560
We take it for granted, but it's very American.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.400
Who would have made a bet on me in France?

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.640
The same person.

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:09.440
I would not have found the same people.

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.720
I would never in France have been able to raise,

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:16.040
at some point it was $32 million for my first business,

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.440
never would have been able to do that in France.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.920
And it doesn't mean that French people are bad people

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:20.760
or anything like that.

01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.560
It's just something that's just not so in the culture.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.120
Just like this whole concept of philanthropy,

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.200
it's not that the French people don't do philanthropy,

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.640
but philanthropy in America is very different

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.280
from the level and also the magnitude

01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:35.880
of maybe what the French people do.

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.960
And also they have this always like,

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.640
oh, let's do it behind the scene.

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:42.440
Money is suspicious, success is suspicious.

01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.520
So at some point, my husband and I just felt like

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:46.040
our friends actually were maybe thinking

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.880
that we're maybe some drug dealers or something.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.040
So we just stopped because it just was not flowing anymore.

01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.040
And so yes, in America, I found this entrepreneurial spirit,

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.720
but then I was able to link it with something

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:03.880
that I'm very familiar with in my country.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.000
See back home in Senegal, I'm part of this,

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.720
you have what we call the moorid, I'm a moorid.

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:13.800
So what it is is one of the four brotherhoods in Senegal,

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.040
mooridism is the most influential of them

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.320
and the biggest one.

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.560
And us, it's all about entrepreneurship as well.

01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.800
I mean, of course there's a whole religious part,

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.240
but our mantra is pray as if you will die tomorrow

01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.480
and work as if you will never die.

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:32.040
And the way we say,

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:34.600
the way somebody will say that somebody passed away,

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.280
we say somebody has retired.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:39.680
Somebody has retired from their work, right?

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:45.680
So I think it's funny because in that community,

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:48.880
we're very much entrepreneurial,

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:52.440
left to our own devices, we're entrepreneurial.

01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:55.440
But then what happens is the minute people start going to,

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.960
they're being educated through the education system,

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.840
like the French, especially education system,

01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:03.320
but tend to breed more like the French bureaucrat mindset,

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:05.520
then you can see all the entrepreneurial mindset

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.880
kind of starting to dwindle down.

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.400
So it's kind of very interesting.

01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:13.040
So in a way, America helped me reunite

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.240
with that side of my roots,

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.840
where America tells me,

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.640
reinforces that side of my roots

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.320
and also gives me more tools

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:23.800
to practice that side of my roots,

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:25.800
if that makes any sense.

01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.240
Through all of that,

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:30.160
that's what brings out the heart of a cheetah,

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:32.320
which I think is a beautiful, beautiful thing

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:36.600
that encapsulates that whole trajectory,

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:38.840
which I think is the best possible answer

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:44.200
it makes me want to really think about who I am,

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.120
because you really have brought together

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.320
so many cultures within yourself.

01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:52.200
Just talking to you makes you feel like

01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:54.280
we are just all one people.

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.640
Because at the end we are, at the end we are.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.360
And when you come from, at the end we are,

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:03.440
and also I think for me,

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:05.520
if people can take anything from my story,

01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.360
it's at the end of the day,

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.680
I am very clear about it,

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:11.240
and I'm all for harmony among people

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:13.800
and among us peoples.

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:20.040
If we can accept that we're all,

01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:21.200
I know this sounds so cliche,

01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.280
but for me it's so true,

01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:24.840
that we're all humans.

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.640
You know, when I left Senegal,

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:30.040
when I was about to leave Senegal for the first time

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.320
and to go to Europe to be reunited with my parents,

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.480
because now they had emigrated

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:37.480
and things were gonna be fine,

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.920
and things were stable for them,

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:43.840
now it's time to be reunited with her.

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.080
They brought me over,

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.360
but before I left Senegal,

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.240
my grandma sat me down.

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:50.240
Actually she lowered herself down to my level

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.080
and she said,

01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.120
said, Magat, you're about to go to this place

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.120
where most people will not look like you.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.960
And most people speak a language

01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:02.240
that's gonna be different from yours.

01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.600
And you're gonna realize that all the kids

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:04.440
are going to school,

01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.760
and you've never been to school,

01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:07.680
because I was, like I said, a free range kid

01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:09.720
and I was just living my life.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.760
And she said, but I don't want for any of that,

01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.600
and she showed her words,

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:17.680
she said, I don't want for any of that to intimidate you.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.400
She said, you can be impressed by some of it if you want,

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:23.360
but no intimidation.

01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:25.040
And she said, because the fact

01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.080
that they might be different from you,

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.120
yeah, they're gonna have a different skin color from you,

01:54:28.120 --> 01:54:31.000
but it is still human skin.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.920
You're human, they're human.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:35.360
And she said, this language you're gonna speak,

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:37.480
it's a different language from yours,

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:41.120
but it is still a language that humans speak.

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.760
You're human, they're human, therefore you're gonna speak it.

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:47.600
And lastly, they have gone to school.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.720
Going to school is what little humans do.

01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:52.840
You're a little human, so you'll be just fine.

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.200
And I went and grandma was right, right?

01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:56.640
She was right.

01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:58.600
And that helped me.

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:03.320
And I think when you internalize that so early on,

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:07.320
it just makes you belong to the human family

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:08.320
that you're part of.

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.360
I am part of a human family.

01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.960
And I would have no problem going to Russia, for example,

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.360
let's take, and be totally open.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.720
Maybe don't go right now, but.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.560
No, not now, maybe not now, you're right.

01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:20.400
But what I-

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.880
At least don't bring weed if you go on the plane.

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, right.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:27.400
That girl, I don't know what she was thinking, but.

01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.600
Yeah.

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:31.000
No, so, but what I'm trying to say, Lex,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.400
is I feel like I can go anywhere in the world,

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.440
including some of the most unfriendly places in the world

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:41.480
to someone like me, because there are places like that.

01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:46.480
And yet I know, I know that somehow, somewhere,

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.880
someone will take care of me.

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.480
Someone will help me.

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:55.480
When I first came to this country, I came as a tourist,

01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:02.360
but you had this amazing family who had a business,

01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:05.880
a family business in Indiana, Columbus, Indiana.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.760
The Wences, Carolyn Eldon Wences,

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.760
I owe them everything that I have in this country,

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:12.440
that I am in this country.

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:17.440
They are Americans in mid-America

01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.520
from a place that most other Americans would maybe

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.080
look down on, because, you know,

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:22.920
and some people would be like,

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:25.040
oh, you're going to this place where they have more churches

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:28.040
and cows than people, you know, that type of behavior,

01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:30.880
because, you know, the coastal elites.

01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.240
But it is in Midwest, in the Midwest,

01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:39.120
that I found that I, black, young women,

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.160
coming out of nowhere, found support.

01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:44.600
They all rallied around me.

01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:47.480
I didn't even come from the same faith as they are from,

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.920
yet their whole church rallied around me

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.640
to find me an apartment.

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:55.600
My host family found me, got me a job,

01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.560
and it was not a pity job.

01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:00.040
They were like, we need, we are in serious needs

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:02.320
of getting our accounting under control

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.520
and our marketing and all of that.

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.480
And I had to catch up years of accounting, like, to the cent

01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:10.000
and come up with marketing, all of that.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.720
And I did it way faster than they thought

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.160
I would ever be able to do that.

01:57:13.160 --> 01:57:14.520
At some point, they look at me and they're like,

01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.360
look, there is a future for you.

01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.840
And we are too small for that future.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.360
And now we could be, we could be selfish

01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:23.280
and keep you here with us.

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:25.600
And we wouldn't, we wouldn't want nothing more than that.

01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.600
Because really, they're like my parents to this day.

01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.280
I just came back from seeing them.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.360
And they said, but there's so much more for you

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.720
and we don't have it.

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.240
So we want you to go and find out what it is.

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.040
And that's eventually when I, you know,

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:41.280
because something was brewing up in San Francisco.

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.600
When I say I left my heart in San Francisco,

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.440
because, you know, my man would become my husband.

01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:48.920
We went to the same business school in France,

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.280
but then he was older than me.

01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:53.480
So he had come to San Francisco and started a business there.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.240
And it just looked like there was something there.

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.360
And Scarol was like, you gotta go to San Francisco

01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.240
and find out with Emmanuel what's going on.

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:00.600
So I went and I left my heart in San Francisco.

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.520
I came back and I'm like, okay, I'm leaving.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.840
Here's the keys to my apartment.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.680
I'm like, I'm out of here.

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.960
So no, but Carole, so this is it.

01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:11.200
This is what I'm saying, especially in these times

01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:14.840
when this country loves to dwell on, you know,

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:16.680
you're bad because you have this skin color.

01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.560
Here are people with a completely different skin color

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:20.840
than mine, completely different faith than mine,

01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:25.840
yet embraced me, protected me, paid for my visa,

01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:30.400
you know, for my lawyer, for my H1B, everything,

01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:34.200
and also played emotional support for me.

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:37.120
And no one, no one asked them to do that.

01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.520
They didn't have to do it.

01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:39.360
They didn't.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.200
So what I'm saying is,

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.280
and this has been the story of my life,

01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:45.600
everywhere I go, regardless of the hostility around me,

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.720
you betcha that there's always,

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.840
always gonna be somebody who shows up for you

01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.040
and somebody who is at the extremes,

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.800
at the antipods of where you are and who you are.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.240
And that tells me something.

01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.040
In the end, we are good people.

01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:02.640
Most people are good people.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.600
And there's so much power to that,

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:10.520
the internalizing of this idea that we're all just human,

01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:13.120
and there's human kindness all around us.

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.800
I've seen it a lot where people internalize that

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.440
and they're able to walk lightly amidst hate

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:24.680
and walk past it.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:29.680
And it doesn't stick to them in a way that

01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:33.080
they build resentment and it paralyzes them.

01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:35.960
If they internalize the world as human,

01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.040
they can be in the world,

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:37.880
just like you said,

01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:40.680
in the worst places in the world for them.

01:59:40.680 --> 01:59:44.440
And someone, somewhere, that human magic and touch is there.

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:46.840
Yeah, it will find them.

01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.480
It will find, yeah, yeah.

01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:49.680
And you know, the other thing too,

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:53.120
especially in these times we're walking in,

01:59:53.120 --> 01:59:55.680
it is to remind yourself,

01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:58.360
I think this is where we all are called

01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:01.320
to practice more courage.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.320
I call it courage.

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:07.160
It's the courage to show up with curiosity,

02:00:07.160 --> 02:00:09.360
with empathy, and with love.

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:13.520
To me, verse three are the antidote to pretty much anything.

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.800
Curiosity and love.

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:19.760
In the face of fear, can you show up with curiosity?

02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:22.960
In the face of hate, can you say,

02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:25.480
I'm gonna engage with love,

02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.640
even if I'm scared to death

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:29.400
and even if I'm pissed off to death by this.

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:30.720
But can you do that?

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.080
In the face of just like judgment or whatever,

02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:36.880
can you show up with empathy?

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.960
And I had just found that when you try to do that,

02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:44.160
you engage very different parts of your brain.

02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.640
That's proven, by the way, by the brain scientists,

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:48.960
but you also can feel it in your body

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.480
that you engage in very different parts of your soul.

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:55.040
And so I try myself, I'm not always good at it,

02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:57.760
but it's a practice that I try to honor,

02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.760
which is curiosity, empathy, and love.

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:02.200
As I told you offline,

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.680
I agree with you 100% on that.

02:01:04.680 --> 02:01:07.960
But there is, you know, when you go to Ukraine

02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:12.560
and you can say, you can speak about the power of love,

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.320
but when you lose your family, when you lose your home,

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.120
all you have in your heart is hate.

02:01:18.120 --> 02:01:21.560
Even if you know it, you're not supposed to have it.

02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.960
You still, all you have is hate.

02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.960
So sometimes it's a very human thing

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.520
to have resentment, to have hate.

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.840
But it is about trying not to stay there.

02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.480
And it's okay if it takes you years,

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.360
but it is about trying, and I mean the word trying.

02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:42.880
It is about trying not to stay there.

02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:45.800
Let me ask you about some of the things

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:48.760
you see in this country from your perspective

02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.680
of everywhere you've been in the world.

02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:53.880
What do you think about the Black Lives Matter movement

02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:57.320
here in America that does struggle

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:03.640
with the role of skin color today

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:07.840
and throughout the history of this country,

02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.360
maybe even throughout the history of the world?

02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:16.400
Well, Black Lives Matter has been a very hard one for me

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:19.600
because do Black Lives Matter, those three words together

02:02:19.600 --> 02:02:23.360
in that order, what they mean, they mean everything

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:25.600
because Black Lives do matter,

02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:27.680
as any other lives do matter.

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.040
But I know in this case why they say Black Lives Matter,

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:32.800
because some of the context we have had.

02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:36.360
Now, while I agree with the principles

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:39.480
that Black Lives Matter, I have a big problem

02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.160
with the organization and what it stands for.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.720
When I have an organization that pretends

02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:51.360
to want to stand for Black Lives to matter,

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.360
yet you are self-proclaimed Marxist socialist,

02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.720
I pause.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:01.760
Why?

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:04.320
I pause and then I'm like, have we learned nothing?

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:08.000
Have we learned nothing?

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.120
And the reason why I say that, Lex,

02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:13.640
is because 60 some years ago,

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:18.520
it started before even 60 some years ago,

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:25.000
Black people in this case,

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.320
I'm talking about the African people.

02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.920
I'm talking about the Black Africans

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:37.920
who would go on to really cement this concept

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.400
of African emancipation and African liberation.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:47.000
And here I'm taking us back to 1945.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.360
They had four of them before that,

02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:54.360
but in 1945 in Manchester, UK happened something

02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.280
that would become major for Africa and its future,

02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.000
especially sub-Saharan Africa.

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:08.080
In Manchester, UK, people like Blaise Degne of my country,

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:14.640
Nyerere, Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana,

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:20.080
and others and others from different parts of the continent

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.080
got together with Marcus Garvey and W.E.B. Dubois.

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:28.880
And I say Dubois because that's how we say it in French.

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.840
He has a French name, a French name at least.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.680
And Americans would say, so for Americans listening,

02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:36.360
I know you say Dubois.

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:37.760
Oh boy.

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760
No, because just in case they're like,

02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.920
who are you talking about?

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:41.320
That's who I'm talking about.

02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.200
So all of those people got together in the UK

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.960
and with W.E.B. Dubois and Marcus Garvey,

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:54.560
big top African-American intellectuals of their times.

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:59.360
W.E.B. Dubois had so many things happen to him,

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.520
starting from the North,

02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.560
being more or less a liberal type guy,

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:08.400
came to the South just to see at this time,

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.840
black people being lynched

02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:14.000
and some of the body parts being shown in store windows.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.160
I mean, just for a second, we put ourself in his shoes.

02:05:18.160 --> 02:05:20.520
I put myself in his shoes.

02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:23.200
And that's when he started to become radicalized, right?

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:24.920
Because at first it was like, oh, reforms.

02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:27.120
And I was like, God darn it, enemy these people.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.120
We don't talk to them, we force, you know?

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:33.160
And eventually little by little things going through.

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:36.560
Yeah, you have these people,

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.920
they're very much on the Marxist socialist train.

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:43.000
So you think the sort of,

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.320
it's the political movements that are just using.

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:49.320
Yeah, because what happened back in those days,

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:52.720
it is true that to their credit,

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.200
communist socialists were fighting for equal rights.

02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:59.360
They were fighting for the rights of black people

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:01.240
to have equal rights.

02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.600
So of course I could see why one could say,

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.840
especially in those times, you've been lynched,

02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:15.840
bodies burnt, body parts showcased at window stores.

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:26.160
Meanwhile, in Africa under colonization,

02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:31.080
in your own country, in your own land.

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.240
And you have this group that's saying,

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:44.480
we, your fight is part of what we fight.

02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.160
Of course, you're gonna say I side with you.

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:53.280
Especially if this is all happening at a time

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:57.360
where, you know, so 1945,

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:00.960
these guys who would be the liberators

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:02.400
of various African nations,

02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:06.800
they're meeting with Garvey, with W.E.B. Dubois.

02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:10.880
And that's where this meeting is very important.

02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:12.960
It's the fifth Pan-African Congress meeting.

02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:14.120
It's very important.

02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:14.960
It could be the last one,

02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:16.720
but it's the most important one

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:18.560
because that's when they formed their plans

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.200
and really rallied around this concept

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:22.520
of African emancipation.

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:26.560
African emancipation and African liberation.

02:07:26.560 --> 02:07:28.320
We're gonna liberate our countries.

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.920
Then later, so that's how all of these movements

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.200
started to happen.

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.160
And from there, Gandhi was already making some progress

02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.560
with India, you know, getting them out of British rule

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.400
and all of that.

02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.760
So all of this was happening and really like,

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:43.640
this whole thing was bubbling, bubbling, bubbling.

02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:46.560
You know, like there's like a new force going on.

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:49.040
And then we arrived in the late fifties

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.640
and, you know, Krumah with, you know,

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:53.680
them with the British as well,

02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.440
they might manage to become,

02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:00.040
to become, their colonization is over.

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.400
They're the first one to go in, 57.

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:05.040
Then from there, it's what we call the independences.

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:07.120
That's what most sub-Saharan African nations

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:08.040
are getting their independences.

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:11.360
Different dates, mine, April 4th, 1960.

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:13.560
So all over, so this is happening.

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.400
But now think about it.

02:08:14.400 --> 02:08:17.000
You're talking 57, you're talking 60.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.480
We're like at the, we're like at this time now

02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:21.280
with the middle of a cold war.

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:23.080
See, because we have to put things in context

02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.680
if we want to understand what's going on.

02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:27.040
Because people today ask me, why do you think,

02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:29.960
because even now when they understand, oh, you're right.

02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:30.800
It makes sense.

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:32.920
If you have no economic freedom, you're going to be poor.

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.880
But why, why, why did they go for this?

02:08:34.880 --> 02:08:35.720
Why did they go for this?

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:36.920
And then they don't understand.

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:37.800
So that's what happened.

02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.880
So beginning of day of times, pre-colonial Africans

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.240
were free marketeers, free enterprise.

02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.120
It's pretty well recorded by someone like George Hayite.

02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:49.240
That's where I got the cheat I think from.

02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:50.640
And Ghanaian economist.

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.880
And then slavery happened, colonialism happened.

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:55.760
And then the independences, late 50s, early 60s

02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:57.200
for most African countries,

02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.840
most sub-Saharan African countries.

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:02.680
So there, what you have is, but then what happened there?

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:06.240
So I told you in 45, 5th Pan-African Congress in the UK

02:09:06.240 --> 02:09:11.240
with the liberators of Africa under the leadership,

02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:15.520
because he was the wise, you know, eldest man.

02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:18.480
Dubois was, he was in his 70s back in the day.

02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:19.880
So he's older than them, you know,

02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.120
and he's coming with all of his ideas and everything.

02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:23.240
So they're like, ooh.

02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:24.480
So there they are.

02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.200
Now in the late 50s, early 60s,

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:28.640
we're starting to make progress with the independences.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.320
You know, India has gone there before.

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.160
So all of that is starting to happen.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.840
And at that time, remember,

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.000
they already were being introduced to the concept

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:40.920
of socialism, Marxism.

02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:45.400
All of that way before by some of these, you know,

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:48.640
black African-American intellectuals of their time

02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.800
who were very socialist Marxists by that time.

02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:54.680
So now they're becoming independent

02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:57.200
because I do independent like this

02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:01.240
because I reckon that there's still neocolonism going on.

02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:04.600
So now this is happening and becoming free.

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.800
But then you look around, what do you see?

02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.040
That now most of these liberators of their nations

02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.920
become the president of the nations.

02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.280
But remember what I told you?

02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:19.280
Most of them have drunken the socialist Marxist socialism

02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:22.280
Kool-Aid.

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:25.960
So as these African nations become independent

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:28.160
with their first independent governments

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:31.000
and, you know, presidents,

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.080
most of them are socialist,

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:38.640
various forms of a statist type of government.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.720
And this is because at that point,

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:45.320
we had made a fatal mistake of going off saying,

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:48.800
we are Marxist socialist

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.200
because you guys fight for equal rights.

02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:53.040
So in this case,

02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.720
there should be no colonialism or anything like that.

02:10:55.720 --> 02:10:58.720
So not only you have that going on and the people,

02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:02.000
so right now you had this battle of ideology going on

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.600
on one end represented by freedom and the economic,

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:06.440
what do you call it?

02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:08.400
The economic system they were using is capitalism.

02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.160
And these are represented by the Western nations

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.320
facing off with Eastern block,

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.280
practicing various forms of statism,

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:19.080
socialism, communism, various forms of statism.

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:21.480
And these two are fighting for influence.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.280
So, and we also have, it's also not, so two things there.

02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.360
One is we are at a time where,

02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.920
remember the free market concept was almost dead.

02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:32.880
Almost dead.

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.960
So almost every intellectual at that time

02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.280
was social Marxist or Marxist socialist.

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:43.240
I put the name, that's what you wear.

02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:46.040
So you're in a world where it was a normal thing.

02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.840
It was just mainstream acceptance.

02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:50.640
So not only you have that force,

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:52.360
but at the same time,

02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.200
if these two forces are fighting one another,

02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.800
it turns out that the one representing capitalism

02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:00.000
and freedom, well, sorry,

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.800
but isn't it you who enslaved us and colonized us?

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:07.320
And you're fighting with the people who represent,

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:10.360
supposedly people who are saying that,

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.200
who had been fighting for equal rights for us,

02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:13.920
with us for the longest time.

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:15.720
These are our friends.

02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:17.800
And that's when we made a fatal mistake.

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:20.840
Because while yes, they were maybe good things

02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.440
to agree on with Marxist socialist of the times,

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.680
especially equal rights for all people and all of that,

02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:30.000
that's the only thing we should have,

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.120
among the only things we should have agreed upon.

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:35.720
There are violent revolution tendencies, no way.

02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:39.520
When it comes to the economic nonsense, no way.

02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:41.920
We should not have thrown the baby out with the bathwater,

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.080
but that's what we did.

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:44.400
And that's when we made a fatal mistake.

02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:47.520
So then we became free, all of these nations,

02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:52.520
and most of them started with socialist or communist leaders.

02:12:52.720 --> 02:12:54.840
My country, socialist.

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.840
Leopold Seder-Senghor, he was a socialist.

02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:01.640
And they stayed in power for 40 years,

02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:05.000
the first 40 years of our freedom years.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:08.160
And all over the continent, more or less,

02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:09.800
that's what you had.

02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.240
And on top of that, something else that the French don't know,

02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:16.120
the people don't know is France, with its colonies,

02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:18.560
said, you cannot not do,

02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.480
you have to keep the French civil law.

02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:30.080
So we're talking about the Napoleonic civil code.

02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:31.600
Are you kidding me?

02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:32.800
So that's what happened.

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.040
So the reason why I go back to BLM

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:40.040
is while I have all the respect in the world

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.640
and all the compassion in the world,

02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.960
for people like Krumer, for people like Nyererewe,

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:48.920
all of those people of those times,

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.640
the liberators of Africa,

02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:54.080
while I have so much love, compassion for them,

02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:57.600
I am also able to say,

02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.040
because I got the benefit of 60 some years time,

02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:06.120
and where you get to do a debrief

02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:08.920
and see what worked, what didn't work, what happened.

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:12.720
We have had the 60 years to look back and to reflect.

02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:18.080
So yes, I can understand why they did what they did.

02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.960
I can understand why they sided with these people

02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:24.720
who on the surface, or at least some part of the fight

02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:27.680
was the same fight as them when it came to equal rights.

02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:31.400
I can excuse them,

02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:38.000
but I will not excuse the BLM founders

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.640
because that mistake was tolerable 60 some years ago.

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:45.920
Today, no.

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:50.920
The blacks of today cannot be serious

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:55.840
about black lives mattering and saying in the same sentence,

02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:58.440
and we're gonna be Marxist socialists.

02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.760
If this doesn't work.

02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:03.480
So the BLM movement is too deeply integrated

02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:04.880
with the ideas of Marxism.

02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:07.120
With those ideologies, yeah.

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.960
They're anti-free market, anti-capitalist.

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.560
And we do know that you have to have free markets

02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:17.400
in order to build prosperity.

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:21.920
And prosperity means economic power.

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.560
If you have economic power, no one messes with you.

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.400
Or if they're gonna do it, they're gonna have to think twice.

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:31.200
And when they do, they're gonna have to pay consequences.

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:35.400
So if you want for blacks to be respected

02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:37.280
anywhere in the world,

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.040
you're gonna have to be serious about black prosperity.

02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:42.280
All mass, not just a few people,

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:45.000
Oprah over here and somebody over there, no.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:50.000
We as a group have to be critical mass of prosperity

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:52.640
across the board.

02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.440
And because we're talking critical mass of prosperity

02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:56.680
across the board,

02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.880
it means black people everywhere in the world.

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:00.960
But guess what?

02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.960
We in Africa happen to represent 90% of our representatives

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:06.240
of a black race.

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.040
So you're gonna be serious about black lives mattering

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:11.440
without being serious for Africa,

02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:14.160
the one billion people in Africa that are black

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:16.400
and for them to have access to the free markets

02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:19.440
and yes, fossil fuels so that they can

02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.280
rocket up prosperity-wise.

02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:27.720
And the resources of the young people, the young minds.

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:29.640
So that all of these young people, young minds

02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:33.760
can finally manifest their greatness that I know they have

02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.280
and that they're showing us every day

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:37.800
despite the obstacles.

02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:40.160
That's what we need.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:42.720
Senegal becomes rich and Senegal can become

02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:45.880
and will be richer than France, Singapore did it,

02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.760
we can do it.

02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:52.360
Mali rich, Nigeria rich, functioning as well.

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:56.640
Malawi rich, Tanzania rich, Uganda rich,

02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:01.640
Zimbabwe rich, Niger rich, everywhere rich, prosperous.

02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:06.120
As prosperous if not more prosperous than Switzerland

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.560
or Singapore or the US don't know all the Lichtenstein

02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:14.560
or Luxembourg, places that have no natural resources.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:19.080
We become rich and you watch the world

02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:22.440
having a very different relationship with us.

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:27.240
That's the only time we will command any type of respect.

02:17:27.240 --> 02:17:32.240
That's when people, even our common psyche

02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:34.720
will change even about black people.

02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:37.360
All of the stereotypes that they have of us

02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.160
is gonna melt away.

02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.120
And you may still not like us,

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.680
but you will still respect us

02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:47.800
because we are a force to be dealt with.

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.160
And only economic power does that.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:54.040
It would be nice, of course, for us to respect people

02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.440
because they're people.

02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:58.600
It would be nice, but let us not kid ourselves.

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.800
This is earth.

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:04.160
And someone said, nice people will make it to heaven,

02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:05.920
but not to Harvard necessarily.

02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:06.760
It's true.

02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:11.760
It's interesting that pity does not ever turn into respect.

02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:14.680
It would be nice if it did.

02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.040
It would be nice, but it doesn't.

02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.080
Prosperity is the only thing.

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:19.520
Prosperity is the only thing.

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.880
And the way we do that, there is no,

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:26.920
just like all of us humans have to inhale oxygen

02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:31.040
and exhale carbon dioxide,

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:33.240
that's a human way of breathing.

02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:35.600
You bring me on, but you wanna be foolish

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.440
and be like, oh, well, sorry.

02:18:37.440 --> 02:18:38.640
That's how white people breathe.

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.760
So as black people,

02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:40.840
we're gonna have to do something different.

02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:43.200
Well, good luck with that, right?

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:44.920
So this is here why I'm saying,

02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:47.120
I have no patience for Black Lives Matter.

02:18:47.120 --> 02:18:49.840
They're making a mistake that was made

02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:54.000
60 some plus years ago, even more than that.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.360
Maybe even a hundred years,

02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.360
when we were siding with a Marxist socialist

02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.400
because they're the ones who've been fighting

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:01.480
for equal rights.

02:19:03.720 --> 02:19:07.520
Let me ask you though about racism.

02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.040
Do you, as you travel through this world,

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.040
as you travel through America, feel the burn of hatred?

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.120
You've spoken about the revolutions that have been fought

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:24.800
throughout the 20th century against racism.

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:28.200
But today, as people talk about educating,

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.280
reminding the world with the,

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:32.280
even with more philosophical ideas

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.720
of critical race theory, for example,

02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:36.960
do you think this is still a battle

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.160
that needs to be fought at the forefront of culture

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:42.480
in the United States?

02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:44.320
Does racism exist?

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:45.160
Yes, it does.

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:49.960
But all forms of isms exist.

02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:53.520
Some people, it's about various forms of ableism.

02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:57.120
Others, it's about size.

02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:01.000
And racism, yes, is one of them.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:01.840
Does it exist?

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:02.680
Yes, it does.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:07.480
But is it what's gonna stop anyone from being able

02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:09.080
to do something different?

02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:12.400
But is it what's gonna stop anyone

02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:14.520
from manifesting their greatest potential?

02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:17.200
I say no.

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.240
I say no.

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.520
Many people in this country have showed it.

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:26.120
Whether they're African-Americans or African immigrant,

02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:27.320
I'm an African immigrant,

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:30.920
you have African-Americans like Oprah and others,

02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.720
and other people even before her,

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:37.480
who despite the nastiness around them,

02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:38.720
were able to make it.

02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:43.680
So we do know, especially as black people,

02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:46.200
but I think it's humanity as a whole.

02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:48.520
And that's what I love about the human spirit.

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:50.680
It's resiliency.

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:52.280
But resiliency only can happen

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:55.160
if you don't allow yourself to be beaten down

02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.720
and to lose yourself of agency.

02:21:00.160 --> 02:21:03.880
It's, of course, easier said than done.

02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:07.760
And some among us need a little bit more help

02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:10.480
to not succumb for it than others do.

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:14.520
And I've seen it, it might be harder for you

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:18.440
if you're somewhere in a city,

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.920
in a city, black America.

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:24.760
Maybe the environment might be a little bit tougher

02:21:24.760 --> 02:21:26.200
for you to try and get your act together

02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:27.760
and all of that stuff.

02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:29.680
And it's okay.

02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:32.280
But even in that situation,

02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:36.200
we need to, I think it's important

02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:39.360
that we still do not rob you of your agency.

02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:44.320
And this is where I am mad as heck

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:48.560
against those who supposedly care.

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:52.280
And their idea of how to make sure

02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:55.360
that I don't become or stay a victim of racism

02:21:55.360 --> 02:21:57.280
is through all the things we talked about,

02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:01.960
the CRT, the anti-racism crap of, you know,

02:22:03.080 --> 02:22:06.320
Abraham X. Kendi and what's her name?

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:07.520
Robin DiAngelo.

02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.520
I mean, her, I'm shocked.

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.160
The woman is making all of this money,

02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:15.640
supposedly fighting a war on our behalf.

02:22:15.640 --> 02:22:18.120
I'm like, lady, I hear you loud and clear

02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.520
that you are a true racist.

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:21.720
I know, but you told me you are.

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:23.320
And for you to think that you're anti-racism

02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.960
makes you less racist.

02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.600
And it's, that happens too.

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:28.760
She comes from a racist background.

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:30.960
Fine, she's saying it, it's true.

02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:35.840
But this idea that every walking person on earth

02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.280
belongs to one category or the other,

02:22:37.280 --> 02:22:38.320
depending on what you, you know,

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:39.880
which skin color you came with,

02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:43.920
it's problematic at its root.

02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:47.520
So my point is, does racism exist?

02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:48.360
Yes.

02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:50.440
Do you think it's gonna stop me

02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.120
from doing anything I have to do?

02:22:52.120 --> 02:22:53.240
No.

02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:55.920
Might it make it harder, longer?

02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:58.640
Maybe, but it will not stop me.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:01.520
But for it not to stop me,

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:03.920
I can't engage in victimhood mentality.

02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:05.520
I can't lose myself or self.

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:09.040
I got to use all the agency that I have

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:11.880
to fight back and fight beyond.

02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:14.000
See, it's just a fight back.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.280
You fight back and you fight beyond.

02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:17.920
Because at some point, yeah, and.

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:19.520
It's this concept of yes, and.

02:23:20.400 --> 02:23:23.680
So this is why I have loved the job.

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.760
So when I have somebody who is like,

02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:28.080
oh, anti-racism is a way,

02:23:28.880 --> 02:23:31.360
we're gonna go and tell all the white kids

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:33.040
that, you know, because they happened to be white,

02:23:33.040 --> 02:23:35.680
that they're really the oppressors and blah, blah, blah.

02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:38.920
And the black kids, because they're black, you know.

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:41.600
You're not changing anything when you're doing that.

02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:44.040
Nothing except that you're putting problems

02:23:44.040 --> 02:23:46.400
where there were no problems to start with.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:48.240
All we had to do was maybe

02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:50.160
go for a different route from there.

02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.320
Kids are kids.

02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:52.560
Kids are born kids.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:54.320
And this, I'm not sure if you wanna get me

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:57.680
going onto the whole science of bias.

02:23:57.680 --> 02:24:00.040
Because that's something I spent years of my life on.

02:24:00.040 --> 02:24:03.960
And my journey on the science of bias

02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:08.960
started with the days of Philando Castile, Eric Garner,

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:12.400
that whole summer of 2016

02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.400
when we had this horrendous, horrendous situation

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:20.440
of black people being killed by the police

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.520
where they shot before asking.

02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:25.000
And the people left to die in the most inhumane way

02:24:25.040 --> 02:24:28.160
for the rest of us to watch from the social media.

02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:29.960
That's me.

02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.440
That's when my George Floyd moment happened.

02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:32.560
Not later, four years ago,

02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.240
when the whole world is like, you know.

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:38.720
So that sent me on a journey

02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.120
of understanding what discrimination is and bias is.

02:24:43.760 --> 02:24:45.560
And in a way, that's the reason why I started this company

02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.120
that I even called Skinny Skin.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.280
That's where it came from.

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.280
Again, criticized by creating.

02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:54.000
I needed to understand what discrimination was.

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:55.240
How does it work?

02:24:55.240 --> 02:24:57.080
Is it true what Candice is saying?

02:24:57.080 --> 02:24:58.800
Is it true what D'Angelo is saying?

02:24:58.800 --> 02:25:03.800
Is it true that it could be that you're racist

02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.680
just because of the skin color you happen to be born in?

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:08.400
Is it true?

02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:09.440
Is it true?

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:10.920
I needed to know.

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:14.560
Because I was at a time of my life where at some point,

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.960
you know, when those killings were happening,

02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:21.200
it was so hard for me being a black person in this country

02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:22.800
and wondering,

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:29.640
I mean, what is this?

02:25:29.640 --> 02:25:31.920
And what do we do with this?

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:35.120
Yeah, is it true?

02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:38.840
How much discrimination am I operating under in the system?

02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:40.000
All of that.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.720
You need to understand the full characteristics of,

02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:45.480
if you're dreaming of making a big change

02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:49.440
by building companies, you have to kind of intuit,

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.080
how much, what am I up against?

02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:53.280
And so this is why, you know,

02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:55.480
spend all of this time on some of the work.

02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.520
And then eventually I understood that discrimination,

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.040
if you wanted to understand it beyond,

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:04.240
it's, you know, beyond the big lines of,

02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.200
especially the clickbait lines

02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:08.480
would make it very black and white.

02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.000
Then I had to really take a moment and I spent time,

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.400
you know, with a world of brain scientists,

02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:16.360
with behavioral psychologists,

02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.200
with evolutionary biologists.

02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:20.080
So you have all of this ecosystem

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:25.480
but together form what one might call the science of bias.

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:28.920
And especially I came across the work

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:32.000
of this team of scientists at the University of,

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.600
I think it's Wisconsin,

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:36.080
and they're the only ones who made sense

02:26:37.160 --> 02:26:39.320
in this sea of nonsense back then.

02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.880
And this article wasn't political,

02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.240
and it was saying something that I could relate with.

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:50.000
And eventually what I learned was,

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:54.400
and this part comes from the evolutionary biologist people,

02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:58.280
they in a way tell you that right around age three,

02:26:58.280 --> 02:26:59.640
can happen sooner or later,

02:26:59.640 --> 02:27:01.440
because you know, we're all different,

02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:04.400
but you go from this person who has to rely

02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.560
on these other people, usually your parents,

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:09.440
to stay alive, to be fed, to be housed,

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:13.080
to be even your diaper change, all of that stuff, right?

02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:15.760
To now, something is kicking in

02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.760
where you have to, in order for you to survive,

02:27:22.920 --> 02:27:24.760
and this is all wired in,

02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:27.120
so you don't even understand it consciously

02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:31.160
as I'm saying it now, where in order for you to survive,

02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:33.240
in order for you to go from this state of dependency

02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.080
to the next stage and more and more and more,

02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:39.000
you're gonna have to develop this ability

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.760
to make sense of the world.

02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:42.280
And what's making sense of the world

02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:44.480
at its most basic level means is,

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.680
can you determine if a situation

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:51.120
or a person is good or bad for you?

02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:56.440
Failure, and you need to be able to do so ever so quickly,

02:27:56.440 --> 02:27:59.160
because failure to be able to do that

02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:01.680
means that you might not be alive the next second.

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:05.200
See, it's so wired in.

02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.200
So this process is starting to kick in.

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:09.880
And at that point,

02:28:09.880 --> 02:28:12.240
your brain is gonna be your best ally for that.

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:14.600
And what the brain is gonna do

02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:16.120
is it's gonna help you,

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:18.360
and the way the brain works is through,

02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:22.520
it works with, it's all wired for efficiency.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:27.520
And the way it goes for efficiency is through automation,

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:29.240
meaning that every time it has computed,

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:30.800
and you probably know these things way better than me,

02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.360
every time it has computed one algorithm,

02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:36.720
it doesn't want to do it again.

02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:39.280
It's almost like this, okay, got it, stored.

02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:40.280
Stored, right?

02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:43.240
And then it adds maybe some little levels of complexity to it,

02:28:43.240 --> 02:28:44.560
but it has to be something new,

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.440
meaning the new level of complexity

02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:49.000
for it to even be willing to reconsider.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.560
Otherwise you have, so then all of a sudden,

02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:54.080
what you have is these neurons in the back of your head,

02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:56.680
and they have created pathways, right?

02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:59.880
So, and every time neurons have created pathway

02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:03.520
among themselves, because basically they're attached,

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:04.720
and here is the pathway.

02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:09.720
Well, this pathway in the world of science of bias,

02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:12.880
it's a habit, in general, it's a habit,

02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:14.760
when they form two pathways, when they form a pathway,

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:15.680
it's a habit.

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:19.600
So if we're willing to talk about unconscious bias,

02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:22.000
because of course it's very different

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.320
from somebody who tells me to my face,

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.560
there's no world in which you or I could ever be equal,

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.040
because you're black and I'm white,

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.840
you're a woman, I'm a man, this, this and that,

02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:36.360
that people like that, again,

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:39.920
1% of psychopaths in our world, they're out there.

02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:41.920
Unfortunately, by the time they do nasty things,

02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:44.440
it's pretty horrible, and that's what all we hear about,

02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:46.280
but I'm talking mostly about the rest of us.

02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:48.720
Remember when I told you that most of us are good people,

02:29:48.720 --> 02:29:51.360
bumbling along, making it up as we're going,

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.120
and that's why I have compassion for human nature.

02:29:54.120 --> 02:29:57.280
So, but really, in the morning when I wake up,

02:29:57.280 --> 02:29:59.200
do you really think that I'm waking up and thinking,

02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:01.480
how am I gonna go kill, how am I gonna go kill Lex?

02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:04.280
That Lex guy needs to go down, he's a man, he's a,

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:05.480
don't take me wrong, I'm sure there are some women

02:30:05.480 --> 02:30:07.280
who feel like that, but I'm not one of them,

02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:10.120
and I do think a majority of us are not, whatever.

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:11.320
But you know, in the morning, I'm waking up,

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:15.440
I'm just like, gee, can I get my tea?

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.200
Oh, my dog is not looking okay today.

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.720
You know, we've got, right?

02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:25.720
It's a lot going on, and so you're using these kind of,

02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:27.040
just like you said brilliantly,

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:30.280
the brain has a bunch of simplifications, it's built up,

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:32.640
and it uses those simplifications to get through the day.

02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:34.560
To get through the day, exactly.

02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:38.000
So then, here you are, needing to make sense of a world,

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:39.960
and then the brain is your best ally in that.

02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:42.640
And the way it's gonna do it is through efficiency,

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:44.240
efficiency done through automation.

02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:47.400
So every time it thinks it's figured something out,

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:48.720
it's never gonna think about it again,

02:30:48.720 --> 02:30:50.840
so that's how you build all of these habits

02:30:50.840 --> 02:30:53.360
of unconscious bias, because everything,

02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:55.600
so it's somewhere along the line,

02:30:55.600 --> 02:31:00.360
you come up with the information that black men

02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.640
walking around with a hoodie equals danger.

02:31:02.640 --> 02:31:04.240
So later, what do you see?

02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:08.800
Whether it's Lex or my god, I'm walking in the dark alley,

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:10.080
maybe I'm gonna run away

02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:12.960
because I've been given that information.

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:16.600
So the best way to think about it is the brain is a hardware,

02:31:16.600 --> 02:31:21.600
and the software it runs on is, what do you call it,

02:31:21.760 --> 02:31:23.560
is a cultural imprint.

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:26.680
All of this information that we're getting from

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:28.280
the Disney movies that you're reading,

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:30.280
telling you that damsels are to be saved

02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:31.680
by the prince and all that stuff,

02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:33.520
and girls wear pink and all, whatever.

02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:36.360
You know, you watch the movies, and all the movies,

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.120
whenever you watch them, it's about Africa,

02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:39.560
they're talking to you about the blood diamonds,

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:40.800
or they're talking to you about slavery,

02:31:40.800 --> 02:31:41.640
or they're talking to you about this,

02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:43.240
and then, no wonder you walk away thinking

02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:44.960
that all the ills of Africa are caused

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:47.560
because of resource extraction, the diamonds,

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:49.440
or they're always fighting each other.

02:31:49.440 --> 02:31:52.360
Look at, I mean, in the movie, you know,

02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:54.600
or, you know, slavery all the time.

02:31:54.600 --> 02:31:56.720
You walk away, and this is it.

02:31:56.720 --> 02:31:58.200
And we all programmed along the same line.

02:31:58.200 --> 02:31:59.880
See, that's the beauty of it.

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:02.440
All of us are, because even some black people

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:03.920
who are gonna claim that they didn't,

02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:06.680
this is not what they registered, really?

02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:08.560
So the truth, so then, when I learned all of this,

02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:11.360
I'm like, wow, this concept of if you've got the brain,

02:32:11.360 --> 02:32:14.680
you've got biases, it comes with the territory,

02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:15.720
that makes sense.

02:32:16.600 --> 02:32:19.880
Now, it doesn't mean we can't transcend

02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:21.280
that function of the brain,

02:32:21.280 --> 02:32:24.840
and that we should transcend it, right?

02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:25.840
But I think it's very important,

02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:27.760
because once you understand that,

02:32:27.760 --> 02:32:30.320
a little bit more peace is created among us,

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.040
because this is not about a black and white,

02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:34.080
or a yellow and green issue.

02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:36.920
It's about, we are human issue.

02:32:36.920 --> 02:32:39.000
And these are part of the things we developed to,

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:42.000
you know, to stay around.

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:45.320
Just like we no longer have to rely on,

02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:48.320
you know, this fear of flight,

02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.880
you know, like ability of the brain,

02:32:50.880 --> 02:32:54.600
because bears over there start running and running fast.

02:32:54.600 --> 02:32:55.800
Right? Today, where are the bears?

02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:56.840
Show me where they are.

02:32:56.840 --> 02:33:01.840
But we have kept this tendency to go for fear of flight.

02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:03.520
I don't know how they say it.

02:33:03.520 --> 02:33:05.640
And so we have this, you know,

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:08.480
courtesan done by the stress, you know, stress triggers,

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:11.560
but back in the days, we have a stress trigger, we run,

02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:14.160
and it's all, you know, expelled out.

02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:15.920
But today we get triggers,

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:17.160
and we don't know what to do with it,

02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:18.880
because where do we run to?

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:19.720
What do we do?

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:21.640
The bear is not even here.

02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:23.400
So same thing here with that.

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:25.880
And so then you realize there's this whole thing

02:33:25.880 --> 02:33:29.160
that is now what you understand is that this problem

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:32.800
is not about anti-racism BS, but it is about,

02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:36.440
can each one of us do the work where the work is needed,

02:33:36.440 --> 02:33:38.560
which is we look inside.

02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:41.680
Can we go for this work of deprogrammation,

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:45.320
this concept of a mindful practice

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:49.600
of undoing the habit of bias?

02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:52.280
And that doesn't necessarily have to do

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.520
with a simple categorization of black and white.

02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:56.520
It's all kinds of biases.

02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:57.480
It's about everything.

02:33:57.480 --> 02:33:58.960
It's about everything.

02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:01.040
And you know, when I started on that journey,

02:34:01.040 --> 02:34:03.200
and me and my friend back then built, you know,

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:06.640
this practice of undoing your habit of unconscious bias,

02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:11.440
we had all types of people come and say,

02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:16.160
wow, I discovered that my bias is against larger people.

02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:18.080
And I'm like, what do you mean?

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.000
Well, I think I, it seems to me like I felt

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.640
that larger people maybe are dumb.

02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:25.880
No, we hurt things.

02:34:25.880 --> 02:34:28.160
And you know, and you don't judge.

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.000
Yeah.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:29.840
You don't judge.

02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.800
And you see, it's at every level, you know,

02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:35.800
like, I don't know, like there's even this one friend.

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:36.640
She was like, you know,

02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:37.760
when I looked into the whole dating thing,

02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.760
I absolutely didn't want to have, you know,

02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.680
date with Asian men because she went,

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:43.560
her mind was into some stereotypes

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:45.520
about the size of whatever.

02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:47.400
And she was like, no.

02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.120
But you see, once you start,

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:51.480
because there's this whole thing of,

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:54.240
it's the five-step thing, bias awareness.

02:34:54.240 --> 02:34:57.320
This, basically at this level,

02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.000
what you're doing is you're learning

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.120
to spot the biases in our culture,

02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:04.480
because that's where the cultural imprint comes from.

02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:06.000
You're watching this movie and you're realizing,

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.400
just like I said, wow, gee, I realized once again,

02:35:08.400 --> 02:35:11.320
the black person is portrayed like the fog of a movie.

02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:15.400
Or, you know, the Latina lady,

02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:16.760
this is how she's been portrayed.

02:35:16.760 --> 02:35:17.600
And you see it everywhere.

02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:20.000
Even the NPR, NPR is happening.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:21.720
Like you're listening to something like NPR.

02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:23.680
It's gonna be more liberal than that.

02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.240
And this gentleman is asking these two candidates,

02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:27.920
one of them is a woman, political candidates,

02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:29.120
the other one is a man.

02:35:29.120 --> 02:35:31.080
I'm hearing him asking the lady a question

02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:32.600
that I know he's not gonna ask the man

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:33.760
and he didn't ask her.

02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.760
He said, how do you balance your race with a family?

02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:42.000
Does a man not have a family?

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:46.160
Right there, you see, it's very subtle.

02:35:46.160 --> 02:35:48.280
But you see, but because now my mind

02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:51.280
is kind of trained to see things, I'm like, interesting.

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:53.280
Or like when the media just says,

02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:57.640
froze climate change issue on something

02:35:57.640 --> 02:35:59.960
without even the choice of words.

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.640
So it's pretty much everywhere.

02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:03.160
You open a book everywhere.

02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:05.040
The interesting thing though,

02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.280
I mean, even that man, woman example,

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:11.920
is I think it's really powerful

02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:14.000
to bring that bias to the surface,

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.520
but not let that lead to kind of fear and paralysis.

02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:20.960
You should almost, I mean, that's where humor is.

02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:24.000
Make fun of it, bring it to the surface.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.800
Acknowledge the fact that those things

02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:27.160
are a part of the conversation.

02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:32.160
And a lot of them are, it's a cultural imprint

02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:33.880
because it's part of culture and that might be.

02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:36.640
There could be, I grew up in the Soviet Union

02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:40.280
where the gender roles were stronger than in other places.

02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:41.280
And that's part of the culture.

02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:46.280
We have to acknowledge that this is affecting how I think.

02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.160
We might like how that works and we might not,

02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:50.800
but we have to acknowledge it.

02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:54.280
Make it part of humor, make fun of yourself,

02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:55.520
all that kind of stuff.

02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:56.360
That's the thing.

02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.200
And so Lex, that's why this first step is bias awareness.

02:37:00.200 --> 02:37:03.120
So you train yourself, oh yeah, okay, that was one.

02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:07.240
Or it's in you, we're talking about you.

02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:11.560
And then from there you replace the bias,

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:12.760
like bias replacement.

02:37:13.720 --> 02:37:17.440
Then it is where you practice the empathy.

02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:19.760
You're like, gee, wow, I wonder how I would feel

02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:21.360
every day I walk into a store

02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:22.800
and the guy thinks he should be following me

02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:25.760
because maybe I might steal something because I'm black.

02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.280
Because once you try that,

02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:28.720
to put yourself in the other person's shoes,

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:31.320
all of a sudden something else starts to click.

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:35.280
And then from there you go on to making connection.

02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:37.920
Then you're making a connection

02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:39.800
and then things start to change.

02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:44.800
Because now you're making, then you make cultural immersion.

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:47.160
So this is where we had some people like this one woman.

02:37:47.160 --> 02:37:51.600
She was very, quite very feminist oriented.

02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:56.080
And she had an issue with women wearing the hijab.

02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:58.120
And because for her, it was like, how come you,

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:03.120
how come, how come you just lower, you know, like,

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:06.360
how come you're accepting this demeaning of yourself?

02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:09.680
Not understanding everything else that comes with it.

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:13.640
But through, as she understood that she even had that bias,

02:38:13.640 --> 02:38:16.040
then she went on through all the different processes.

02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:18.280
And then eventually when comes the next step,

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:21.800
cultural immersion, she started going to mosques

02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.360
during Ramadan when the Muslims are doing, you know,

02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:27.080
they're, it's the holy month of, you know, fasting

02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:28.960
and then we break at night.

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:32.440
And she started understanding very different things.

02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:35.840
And eventually happens the last step that happens naturally,

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:38.920
making a true, real, genuine connection.

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:40.840
And this is where friendships happen.

02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:42.040
This is where that's it.

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:43.280
You guys can go home now

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.280
because it has been challenged with reality

02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:47.400
and understanding.

02:38:47.400 --> 02:38:51.400
And so for me, that is what I was after.

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.760
And then, but then the world was just like,

02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:55.880
we don't wanna be told we're part of a problem.

02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:59.240
So, but I still reckon that it is the type of mindfulness,

02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:00.680
type of practice that's gonna need to happen.

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:04.200
And it's one that's very internal to you.

02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:08.600
It is not, and it happens, everybody at their own pace.

02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:13.640
So all of this, I take it back to, to the racism,

02:39:14.040 --> 02:39:15.640
the question you were asking me.

02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:17.480
Does racism exist?

02:39:17.480 --> 02:39:18.520
Yes, it does.

02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:20.360
Is it gonna stop me from doing anything I want to do?

02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:21.200
No.

02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:23.040
Is it gonna make it harder?

02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:27.480
But this is where for anybody who is serious

02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:32.080
about making sure, about fighting racism,

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.240
I think the only job you have to do

02:39:36.240 --> 02:39:41.240
is to make sure that people keep their sense of self agency

02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:46.400
and B, can you help provide people with the tools

02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:49.040
to stand up?

02:39:49.040 --> 02:39:52.600
So this is why I have so much respect for Van Jones.

02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:54.160
People like Van Jones,

02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:56.280
although I disagree with him on so many things,

02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:00.440
but people like Miss Alice Johnson,

02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:03.040
she was pardoned by President Trump

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:05.480
through the work of people like Van Jones

02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:08.120
and Kim Kardashian and others.

02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:09.760
They all joined forces.

02:40:09.760 --> 02:40:11.640
This is a case where people of,

02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:15.520
and those folks then went on to combine forces.

02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:20.520
Furthermore, no regard given to their political belongings.

02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:25.800
They said, if the issue is criminal justice reform,

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.520
then anybody who stands for it has to come together.

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:31.760
And so what they did in this situation

02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:34.800
with what they're doing,

02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:37.120
criminal justice reform in my mind

02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:42.120
is a valid action to fight racism in my mind.

02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:45.080
Because what are you doing there?

02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:47.120
You're trying to get people out of jail

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:49.520
who really have no business being there.

02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:52.720
And also when you have people like Bishop Omar

02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.280
and the people he passed away, unfortunately,

02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:57.920
but today we have Anton Lucky,

02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.160
who was in jail for having killed his cousin.

02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:08.960
I think he started the gang in South Dallas.

02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.400
So we're talking really tough guy

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:13.400
who was within the wrong side of the equation.

02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:16.640
And then in jail, literally he found Plato,

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:17.920
the cave and all of that.

02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.760
So today these people,

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:22.400
I'm like, why don't we hear more about them,

02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:23.960
the urban specialists?

02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:25.280
Because these people,

02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:28.360
it's not about the anti-racism crap of Candido D'Angelo,

02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.640
I'll say it again, until the cows come home,

02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:33.240
but it is about, we go where help is needed.

02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:37.760
We go in urban inner city,

02:41:37.760 --> 02:41:40.280
inner city, black inner city neighborhoods,

02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:43.360
and block by block, we change the culture.

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.560
And they say it like that.

02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:45.600
It's their words.

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:47.120
These are African-American people

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:48.760
who have as many rights as anybody else

02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:50.200
to talk about their own culture.

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:53.800
And they will tell you, we have to change the culture.

02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:55.920
I have some videos like that on my YouTube

02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:57.640
with Bishop Omar.

02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:00.000
What these people are doing is what we need to do.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.280
Bishop will explain and he says,

02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:06.280
sometimes people are their feet deep down in the mud.

02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:11.280
And what we have to do is to try to pull them up.

02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:13.560
And you cannot say you didn't pull them up

02:42:13.560 --> 02:42:15.360
because we're not seeing their head out yet,

02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:18.640
but how much progress have they made from the bottom

02:42:18.640 --> 02:42:22.240
to where they are now and keep going.

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:24.560
So what I see these people doing,

02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.400
you see, I have so much,

02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:29.400
I love and respect Glenn Lowry and company,

02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:30.720
and Ian Rove and all of those guys.

02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:31.680
I love them.

02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:34.280
I love a lot of the things that they say.

02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:37.760
This whole concept of personal responsibility,

02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:38.960
don't know that.

02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:40.360
But I'm just like, at some point,

02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:43.800
it also needs to be matched up with real actions.

02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:46.760
And that's what the people like Anton Lucky,

02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:50.160
urban specialist, Alice Johnson are doing.

02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:51.240
They're going where it's hard.

02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:52.880
Alice Johnson is getting people out of jail

02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:54.880
every single day, literally.

02:42:54.880 --> 02:42:57.440
And then people like Anton Lucky and his team

02:42:57.440 --> 02:43:01.160
are giving them the tools to leave the gang life,

02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:05.320
to be better people, to go for a life of redemption.

02:43:05.320 --> 02:43:07.160
This is happening right now.

02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:08.640
But what I find is they're not getting

02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:10.320
the bulk of the attention.

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:13.680
But this is anybody who's serious about,

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:17.400
this is why, how I would love to see people do anti-racism

02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:21.560
is help lift people up for real.

02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:22.400
Action.

02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:26.000
Support school choice.

02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.200
Support school choice.

02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:30.880
Black mamas, they know what's going on.

02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:32.920
And when they tell you we want school choice,

02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:34.040
they know what to talk about.

02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:35.440
They're not idiots.

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:36.280
Give them-

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:37.120
Especially at the local level.

02:43:37.120 --> 02:43:37.960
Yes.

02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:38.880
Helping them at the local level.

02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:39.720
Yes.

02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:42.880
So help them make sure that they can take their kids

02:43:42.880 --> 02:43:44.760
out of these public schools

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:48.280
that are doing horrendous things to them.

02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:50.480
Miss Virginia, watch that movie.

02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:55.200
How could you not support black moms in this country

02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:57.640
to take the kids to safety when it comes to education?

02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:59.120
How come not?

02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:00.880
That's what I want to see happen.

02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:04.600
And not like some, let's go to some classrooms

02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:06.760
and everybody's white, you go over here.

02:44:06.760 --> 02:44:09.000
Everybody's an extinct, you go over here.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:10.680
And kids, let us tell you about this.

02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:13.320
No, no, no, no.

02:44:13.320 --> 02:44:14.160
As a black person,

02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:16.000
I don't want you to do any of that crap.

02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:19.720
Let me grow my wings.

02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:22.280
If you want, help put some fuel behind them

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:23.600
and let me take my flight.

02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:24.840
That's all I'm asking for.

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:29.840
That's the only way for you to be part of a racism battle

02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:32.240
if that's what you think is the most important battles

02:44:32.240 --> 02:44:33.480
of our life.

02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:34.320
That's it.

02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:35.440
That's what I have to say about that.

02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:37.680
And so for me, I'm keeping my head very straight.

02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:42.680
It's about what enables black people

02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:45.320
to thrive.

02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:49.000
I don't need for you to be an activist on my behalf.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.400
No, because when you're doing that,

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:52.800
you're doing exactly what you've been doing to us,

02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:55.160
black people in Africa, our whole life.

02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:56.960
I don't need your white savior complex

02:44:56.960 --> 02:44:58.440
because that's what anti-racism is.

02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.680
White savior complex, that stuff doesn't work.

02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:02.680
It only works to make you feel better

02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:04.360
about how superior you are to me.

02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:07.040
But it does nothing, absolutely nothing

02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:08.440
to change my everyday life.

02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:11.280
If it is not, if it is, at least in the African side,

02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:13.600
to actually even change my,

02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:17.560
turn me into somebody who's waiting for handouts.

02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:20.800
So I would encourage people to really,

02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:23.040
those people who are really serious

02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.600
about wanting to be part of a solution.

02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:26.480
And I know there are many out there

02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:28.520
for the love of God and everything that's out there

02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:31.520
and we care about, stop.

02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:35.840
It's about think about what's gonna enable people.

02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.680
Maybe the word is wrongly chosen,

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:42.400
but know what I'm talking about.

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:45.040
Give them the freedom to spread their wings.

02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:49.120
Yes, give a person, teach a person how to fish

02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:50.760
and don't give them a fish.

02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:53.120
When you're putting your stupid signs on a lawn

02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:55.120
with Black Lives Matter and all that crap,

02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:56.040
you're not helping.

02:45:56.040 --> 02:45:58.520
And when you're buying one more anti-racism book

02:45:58.520 --> 02:46:02.960
or as a company, financing one more DEI,

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.560
if it's done along those lines,

02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:06.960
I think we've got a problem.

02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:12.000
So you do think that the efforts of diversity,

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:16.280
equity and inclusion are often not effective?

02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:17.360
Not only are they not effective,

02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:18.760
but they're also backfire

02:46:18.760 --> 02:46:20.560
and there are reports on all of this.

02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:25.440
And at the end of the day, it makes sense.

02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:26.760
It makes sense.

02:46:26.760 --> 02:46:29.680
So for me, I am very, very glad

02:46:29.680 --> 02:46:34.160
that people have developed an enlightenment about this.

02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:37.560
Very happy about that, very.

02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:39.440
But let us not keep going

02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:44.120
for the easy perceived solution to problems.

02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:47.880
Again, they've done this to us, the poor people of Africa.

02:46:47.880 --> 02:46:51.880
They thought the solution was to give.

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:53.880
It does not work.

02:46:53.880 --> 02:46:54.720
And then they say,

02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:59.280
oh, we're gonna do a social entrepreneurship on you.

02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:00.720
Tom shoes, buy one pair of shoes

02:47:00.720 --> 02:47:01.960
and we give one pair of shoes

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.560
to some people in poor countries.

02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.120
Then guess what happened to us?

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:09.320
In the town where we operate in Senegal,

02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:11.120
where I have my little manufacturing,

02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:15.960
we have 2000 little mom and pop businesses.

02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:18.680
And guess what they happen to be in, Lex?

02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:21.360
Shoemakers, right?

02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:23.200
So every shoemakers,

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:26.200
each one of them hires at least five, 15 people.

02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:29.360
Do the math, family businesses.

02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:32.960
Guess what happens to them the day

02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:36.360
the Tom shoes truck shows up with bunch of free shoes.

02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:39.760
Yeah.

02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:42.040
Who can compete against free?

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:43.400
Now all of these people,

02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:45.040
little by little gonna have to close their shops

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:46.520
because who can compete against free?

02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:49.400
Because Tom shoes dumping all of his shoes on them.

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:50.320
And then they go out of business.

02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:53.000
And now instead of helping anybody,

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:54.760
you actually sent all the kids

02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:58.800
who depended on these adults working in these places.

02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:00.400
Now they have to join the rank of kids

02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:01.800
who need to be given shoes

02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:05.760
because you took their parents' ability

02:48:05.760 --> 02:48:10.400
to make money through their wages and buy them shoes.

02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:12.240
You see?

02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:14.120
So first they said, we just have to give.

02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:19.080
So that was primarily the charity business.

02:48:19.080 --> 02:48:22.640
And you still have foreign aid business going on.

02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:24.400
So we just need to give.

02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:27.440
And then the social entrepreneurs came in place.

02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.800
But I'm like, the only person for this business is good

02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:32.680
is for Blake McCarthy, the founder of Tom shoes.

02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:33.680
But other than that,

02:48:33.680 --> 02:48:36.560
I'm not sure really seeing who else is winning from this.

02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:39.640
And then they, and so today my whole thing is

02:48:41.080 --> 02:48:46.080
we got a challenge to have a mind for the poor

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:49.080
or to have a mind for the lesser fortunate

02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:50.560
maybe in this country.

02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:54.000
It is easy and lesser fortunate because

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:57.240
for anybody that you feel like is being trampled upon

02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:58.880
because of something,

02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:00.720
maybe it's because of economic circumstances

02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:02.920
or maybe it's race in this case or whatever.

02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:08.160
To have a heart for the lesser fortunate among us

02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:12.640
for whatever reason, that's easy.

02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:15.520
But to have a mind for them, that's the challenge.

02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:18.600
Let me ask you a difficult question.

02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:19.560
Yeah.

02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:22.760
As if we were not already asking difficult questions.

02:49:22.760 --> 02:49:24.120
The president of Senegal,

02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.760
Manky So is also now the chair of the African Union.

02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:34.760
He met with the president of Vladimir Putin on June 3rd,

02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:39.240
I think primarily was to discuss food security.

02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:40.320
Security.

02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:45.320
Africa seems to be split halfway on their perspective

02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:46.840
in the war in Ukraine.

02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.640
So broadly speaking, what do you think about this?

02:49:51.640 --> 02:49:53.760
First of all, the geopolitics of Africa

02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:58.280
and the geopolitical relationship of Africa

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:01.800
with the rest of the world and this current conflict

02:50:03.360 --> 02:50:04.680
with the war in Ukraine.

02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:07.000
What are your thoughts there?

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.520
Well, you've seen that many countries

02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:13.000
when it was time to vote, some of them abstained,

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.600
which in a way says something.

02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:17.840
I think for the Africans today,

02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:20.160
especially as represented by the African Union,

02:50:20.200 --> 02:50:23.000
because not all countries falling along the same lines.

02:50:24.080 --> 02:50:27.160
I feel like, again, we're back to way back.

02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:29.960
For the longest time, the West tries to tell us what to do.

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.840
They decide for us.

02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:37.480
And here, there's trouble,

02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:42.360
meaning there's definitely a rift, major one,

02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:44.360
between most of the Western world

02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:48.080
as represented by Europe and America primarily,

02:50:48.080 --> 02:50:49.800
and you have Australia and all that.

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:53.160
And then they're saying,

02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:56.960
I think this is more or less an attempt

02:50:56.960 --> 02:51:01.960
to stand on their own as well.

02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:07.280
It's like, don't tell us what to do, as usual.

02:51:07.280 --> 02:51:09.720
You always rope us in with when it makes sense for you,

02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:10.840
you try to rope us in,

02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:13.080
and then we're left hanging on our own.

02:51:13.080 --> 02:51:15.040
So this goes back to the sentiment

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:16.880
you were talking about earlier.

02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:21.880
It's been challenging for me to watch this,

02:51:22.520 --> 02:51:26.520
because remember, I have one foot also,

02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:28.720
because there's what I get to see and hear

02:51:29.680 --> 02:51:31.880
from being in the Western world,

02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:34.280
but there's also what I get to see and hear

02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:37.080
from when I'm back home.

02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:38.800
So I wear all hats.

02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:44.720
And I think this is a situation where the African Union

02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:48.480
and African nations in general are saying,

02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:54.920
this is a case where one was like, you guys are fighting.

02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:56.600
You guys are fighting.

02:51:56.600 --> 02:51:59.520
Maybe for once, we have to watch out for ourselves.

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:04.520
Yeah, there's a sense in which this is the embodiment

02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:08.400
abstaining from a vote on the war in Ukraine

02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:13.000
is a political embodiment of a resistance

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:14.520
to the influence of the West.

02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:16.880
It's not about the war between

02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:18.480
whatever you guys are fighting.

02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:23.480
It's saying, we're not going to let this particular empire

02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:26.920
that seems to be at the top right now,

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:29.440
which is the United States Empire in Europe,

02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:33.800
to dominate our political discourse,

02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:36.600
our geopolitical considerations.

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:39.200
It's almost like, no, we're not touching this.

02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:40.840
Especially if given usually.

02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:43.880
So when they need us, again, for influence,

02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:45.280
which means more power,

02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:47.760
oh, you guys vote the same way we do.

02:52:47.760 --> 02:52:52.760
And when it's all over and they go back to spreading,

02:52:52.920 --> 02:52:54.440
they go back to, how do you say that?

02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:59.200
They go back to exchanging and sharing between themselves

02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:03.040
the goodies of their Halloween collection.

02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:07.600
We're not there when the goodies are being shared.

02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:11.560
So I think it's definitely one of those situations.

02:53:11.600 --> 02:53:14.600
But for me, it still is hard

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:17.080
because I watch everything that's going on

02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:23.320
and it's going to be complicated,

02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:25.320
the ramifications of all of this.

02:53:25.320 --> 02:53:28.720
I would like to see our African leaders also.

02:53:28.720 --> 02:53:30.520
What they're doing is clear,

02:53:30.520 --> 02:53:34.040
but this is a place where I'm also tempted to say,

02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:36.720
yes and.

02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:41.680
Yes, to the reasons you're advancing right now.

02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:46.560
We don't want to be always siding because we're tired.

02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:48.880
We're tired of always being dragged around

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:51.320
and taken for granted and you vote our way.

02:53:52.440 --> 02:53:55.960
Come on guys, when you need us, we're great

02:53:55.960 --> 02:53:56.800
and everything is good.

02:53:56.800 --> 02:53:59.040
And then when it's time to go and share the goodies,

02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:00.480
we don't exist anymore.

02:54:00.480 --> 02:54:03.920
And you actually go for policies that go against us.

02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.400
But in this situation though,

02:54:07.240 --> 02:54:09.800
I would like to still see us do the right thing.

02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:14.800
In my case, I was not very happy to see us going

02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:18.600
and more or less begging for, you know,

02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:21.280
what do you call it?

02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:22.120
Cereals.

02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:26.160
Oh, please let the cereals make it

02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:29.200
so at least we get them and we don't starve.

02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.440
I can understand why a president

02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:33.200
would say something like that

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:35.520
or try to negotiate something like that.

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:39.360
But when it comes to an African president

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:44.360
having to do that with a non African president,

02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:47.920
I'm sorry, but for me, it's too close to begging.

02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.240
Listen, it's hard to be a leader.

02:54:49.240 --> 02:54:52.240
It's such a difficult dance because in some sense,

02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:57.240
sort of the flip side of that is you're creating a market,

02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:01.800
a geopolitical market of saying,

02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:05.440
we're willing to sit down at the table with America,

02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:10.440
with European leaders, with Russian leaders, with China.

02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:13.920
And we're gonna let you guys convince us

02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:17.120
who we should collaborate with.

02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:21.760
And that's what sort of great nations

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:23.600
and groups of nations do.

02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:25.600
Now, there's a cynical, of course,

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:29.840
a dark perspective with that because what's in that game

02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:32.240
played by leaders, the people that hurt,

02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:36.440
people of Ukraine hurt, people of Africa can hurt.

02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:37.320
People of Russia.

02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:40.160
People of Russia can hurt, people of China,

02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:44.960
people of United States, but it is the way of the world.

02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:49.000
And to earn, you have to earn respect

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.480
and sometimes earning respect leads

02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:52.920
to the suffering of many.

02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:56.160
Well, but except in this case, yes to all of that.

02:55:56.160 --> 02:56:01.160
And the reason why I'm actually upset with going

02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:03.880
and being like, oh, can you let at least the boats

02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:05.960
that are supposed to come to Africa full of cereals

02:56:05.960 --> 02:56:08.120
come over the wheat and all that.

02:56:08.120 --> 02:56:11.520
It's just like, look, Africa has the highest land

02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.240
that you can do agriculture on.

02:56:14.920 --> 02:56:18.240
We have a larger surface, such surface in the world.

02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:22.480
Why is this not a time for us to try to wean ourselves

02:56:22.480 --> 02:56:24.720
off of cereals that we don't necessarily have

02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:29.400
on the ground, but no, let us go and plead.

02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:31.960
Don't beg, create instead.

02:56:31.960 --> 02:56:33.360
Create instead, exactly.

02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:36.520
This should have been just like how the rest of the world

02:56:36.520 --> 02:56:39.520
when COVID happened and China had to close off

02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:41.640
for different reasons and since then has not

02:56:41.640 --> 02:56:44.440
completely reopened and people have started to realize,

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:48.720
wow, we've got too much, we're too dependent on China

02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:50.640
for a lot of what we need.

02:56:50.640 --> 02:56:53.080
So we're gonna have to bring back some production

02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:56.240
to the US, the Europeans are doing the same, all of that.

02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:59.280
This should have been a time for African leaders

02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:04.280
to be like, we need to be serious now about food security

02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:08.400
and maybe the stuff that maybe don't grow

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.160
under our climates necessarily,

02:57:10.160 --> 02:57:12.480
can we work on coming up with different things?

02:57:12.480 --> 02:57:14.560
Now, I understand that it can take time,

02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:17.520
but if I knew that that was happening at the same time

02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:20.280
that we're saying, oh, well, let the cereals come in,

02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:22.280
maybe I would be a little bit easier with it.

02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:24.120
But right now, I'm just like, is it gonna be

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:25.600
the same business as usual?

02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.280
And in this case, I'm just like, are we gonna keep going

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:30.960
from one massa to another massa?

02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:31.800
I mean, really?

02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:35.960
The interesting aspect of all of this is if we look at

02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:38.920
all of human history, it's possible that the 21st century

02:57:38.920 --> 02:57:40.400
is defined by Africa.

02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:41.800
It will be.

02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:45.640
And the young people, the huge number of young people,

02:57:45.640 --> 02:57:48.040
it's like the trajectory could be, there's so much

02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:51.480
possibility to define the future of human civilization

02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:52.560
in Africa.

02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:55.440
And I don't mean sort of in the next 10 years,

02:57:55.440 --> 02:57:57.440
I mean in the next 50 years.

02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:03.280
So some people are concerned about overpopulation.

02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:06.480
Some people are concerned about us dying out

02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:07.720
as a human species.

02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:12.360
Both of those people live in Austin.

02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:13.480
Talk to me often about it.

02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:14.320
I know, I know.

02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:17.160
I know.

02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:18.240
I know who they are.

02:58:19.240 --> 02:58:22.680
What's your, in Africa, is at the center of this?

02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:26.400
Because there is a vibrant, huge number,

02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.800
probably over a billion people?

02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:30.520
Yeah, we're 1.3 billion people

02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:33.440
and of those, one billion blacks.

02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:36.720
I mean, where do you land on that?

02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:41.040
There is a reason, Lex, why I say I'm haunted,

02:58:41.880 --> 02:58:45.480
that I'm obsessed, that I'm monomaniacal

02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:47.320
when it comes to the free markets,

02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:50.320
and that I have such a strong sense of urgency

02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:53.720
to the point that literally it is affecting me.

02:58:53.720 --> 02:58:56.120
And it has to do with the fact that, yes,

02:58:56.120 --> 02:58:58.560
you have the youngest region on earth

02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:01.400
in terms of the age of its population

02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:04.600
and the growth and the rate at which it's growing,

02:59:04.600 --> 02:59:09.160
demographic-wise, I am not willing to stay there

02:59:09.160 --> 02:59:12.400
and say it's a curse for humanity.

02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:15.080
But it will be a curse for humanity

02:59:15.080 --> 02:59:19.320
if we don't make sure that these people,

02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:24.800
our youth, gets to partake.

02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:29.080
And what it takes to partake is not much.

02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:30.800
So if the rest of the world thinks

02:59:30.800 --> 02:59:35.120
that get to partake means you have to send more foreign aid,

02:59:35.120 --> 02:59:38.760
you have to have more charity businesses send,

02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:42.600
I mean, charity organizations sending stuff away,

02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:46.720
of course, you're almost thinking parasites.

02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:48.240
I'm sorry to say it this way.

02:59:48.240 --> 02:59:50.080
If this is what you're thinking,

02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:52.200
you're seeing us as no more than parasites.

02:59:53.080 --> 02:59:54.960
And if that's what it's gonna be,

02:59:55.880 --> 02:59:59.440
I could see why some people might be worried about that,

02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:04.320
although humans should never be seen as parasites,

03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:06.080
no matter, no matter, no matter.

03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:09.000
But some people will go there.

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:12.800
Now, people are here.

03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:16.600
What are we gonna do, dispose of them?

03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:18.080
That's not an option.

03:00:18.080 --> 03:00:20.400
So the only option we have left

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:22.080
is to make sure that people partake.

03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:26.760
And what partaking means is that people get included in them

03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:31.760
and are part of the systems that allow for human flourishing.

03:00:31.880 --> 03:00:33.840
And it doesn't, it's not much.

03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:35.960
In this case, it's about,

03:00:35.960 --> 03:00:38.840
can we be serious about the reforms?

03:00:39.680 --> 03:00:43.680
So we have free market zones, areas where people,

03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:47.280
where the flourishing can start to take place.

03:00:48.640 --> 03:00:52.720
The wealth that people will need to flourish,

03:00:52.720 --> 03:00:55.320
they don't need you to give it to them.

03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:58.640
But it's all about, can I let you fly

03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:01.680
and you will make it happen for you and also for me?

03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:05.120
Every young African I see today,

03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:07.880
I realize how stupid the rest of the world is

03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:11.600
if they're not supporting what I'm trying to talk about.

03:01:11.600 --> 03:01:13.200
Because even if you don't wanna do it

03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:14.080
because that's the right thing to do,

03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:16.280
which I think it is the right thing to do,

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.640
yourself in it, maybe engage your selfishness.

03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:22.000
Because this person right there,

03:01:22.000 --> 03:01:24.760
remember I told you, seven billion geniuses,

03:01:24.760 --> 03:01:26.360
everybody is came to this world

03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:30.560
with a piece of solution to the human problem.

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:33.200
This person and that person and that person

03:01:34.280 --> 03:01:37.360
hold something for me because I'm part of humanity.

03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:41.120
This person might have a cure to a cancer

03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:44.360
that might take my wife out, the wife I haven't met yet.

03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:47.560
But this kid right here has it inside.

03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:50.320
And if I help this,

03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:53.000
if I make sure that this kid gets a chance to flourish

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:56.480
and to manifest his genius or her genius,

03:01:56.480 --> 03:01:59.280
that trickle down many years later

03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:03.080
comes straight back to serve me and the love of my life.

03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:04.720
If we can't see it any other way,

03:02:04.720 --> 03:02:07.040
maybe let's try to think about it that way

03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.320
because it becomes a very good proposition at that point.

03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:13.160
So in this case, by 2050,

03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:16.920
Lagos, Nigeria will be the largest city in the world.

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:20.800
The future is African, whether we want it or not.

03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:23.400
But is it gonna be an African future

03:02:23.400 --> 03:02:26.680
where you have a youth being a ticking bomb?

03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:31.400
Because they have not, you know, there's no hope.

03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:34.960
They stay in poverty because they belong to nations

03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:35.840
that don't even understand

03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:39.200
sometimes the importance of common law versus civil law

03:02:40.080 --> 03:02:43.840
because they're trapped in countries that don't understand

03:02:43.840 --> 03:02:47.520
that, you know, you need to make the legal framework

03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:49.920
to provide for better economic freedom.

03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:53.960
So you can unleash the genuineness, the awesomeness,

03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:58.000
the ingenuity, the industrious side of your young people,

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:00.240
especially of your women,

03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:01.800
so that they build all the wealth

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:04.080
that your nation is gonna need you to build.

03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:06.440
And with it, the respect that comes from that.

03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:08.920
See, we have a choice to make.

03:03:08.920 --> 03:03:12.680
And this is why I feel so, so, so restless about this

03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:14.840
at this point of my life.

03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:16.480
We just lost George Hayite.

03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:19.840
George Hayite is one of the few Africans that I knew

03:03:19.840 --> 03:03:23.360
who put this out.

03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:25.120
That's who I learned from.

03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:26.440
He's gone.

03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:30.120
And I feel a strong sense of urgency

03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:32.880
to not only bring back to the table

03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:34.960
that which he has been working on,

03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:38.440
but to also make sure that it gets seen.

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:40.600
That's why being here talking with you today,

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:44.160
you have no idea.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.120
People ask, if someone like you could say,

03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:49.320
what can I do?

03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:52.880
You did more than you could ever imagine

03:03:52.880 --> 03:03:56.280
by just allowing me to take this message to one more person.

03:03:57.400 --> 03:03:59.600
And because if we do this,

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:02.880
the change is gonna happen somewhere down the line.

03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:03.720
So-

03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:04.680
The ripple effects of all of that

03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:06.840
on the unlocking the human potential.

03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:07.680
It's unbelievable.

03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:11.920
Of all those people in Africa building cool stuff,

03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:12.760
amazing things.

03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:13.960
Yes, yes, yes.

03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:15.520
So some are gonna be built stuff.

03:04:15.520 --> 03:04:17.280
Others are gonna work on the reforms.

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:18.800
So we're working on reforms, by the way.

03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:22.560
I'm the head of the Africa Center for Prosperity

03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:23.560
of the Atlas Network,

03:04:23.560 --> 03:04:25.680
the largest organization in the world

03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:27.560
working on taking down barriers of entry

03:04:27.960 --> 03:04:29.440
for entrepreneurs around the world

03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:31.000
in their respective countries.

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:32.600
So we're doing great work there.

03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:39.920
Obviously all the think tanks we have in Africa right now,

03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:41.120
free market think tanks,

03:04:41.120 --> 03:04:43.840
and we wanna promote more of them to come up.

03:04:43.840 --> 03:04:46.600
And these are local solutions by local people

03:04:46.600 --> 03:04:48.760
for their local problems, always.

03:04:48.760 --> 03:04:50.200
That's where we draw the line.

03:04:50.200 --> 03:04:55.200
And so there, so we're working on reforms primarily

03:04:55.520 --> 03:04:57.120
and making people understand the free markets

03:04:57.160 --> 03:04:58.360
and the importance of it.

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:03.200
But it is piecemeal legislation.

03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:04.680
It takes time.

03:05:04.680 --> 03:05:05.840
It is hard.

03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:07.960
By the time you accomplish something here,

03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:09.640
more crap has happened over here.

03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:10.920
More laws have been pounded up

03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:13.480
because you know how they fix a bad law most of the time.

03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:14.720
Whether it's in the US or somewhere else.

03:05:14.720 --> 03:05:17.640
Put other laws to kind of undo the law from before,

03:05:17.640 --> 03:05:18.920
but it keeps stacking up.

03:05:18.920 --> 03:05:20.400
And before you know it,

03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:22.520
where you should have one thing and it's clear,

03:05:22.520 --> 03:05:24.440
you have a hundred and they go against each other

03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:26.240
and then it's all, it's worse.

03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.000
So we have piecemeal legislation that happening.

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.320
Our teams are doing really amazing, fantastic work,

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:34.040
especially the team in Imani in Ghana.

03:05:34.040 --> 03:05:37.160
We have a group in Burundi, in the Great Lakes.

03:05:37.160 --> 03:05:40.480
I mean, people are doing amazing work, amazing work,

03:05:40.480 --> 03:05:42.160
but we need to run faster.

03:05:42.160 --> 03:05:45.320
So while we help them running faster,

03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:48.120
we also have to unlock other things.

03:05:48.120 --> 03:05:53.040
And right now I'm working on one of my most craziest projects.

03:05:53.080 --> 03:05:57.240
Something bold, radical, crazy for some people.

03:05:57.240 --> 03:05:58.400
But I know we're not crazy

03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:00.960
because before us Singapore has done it.

03:06:00.960 --> 03:06:03.440
You know, Hong Kong has done it.

03:06:03.440 --> 03:06:06.120
Latest, the most recent China with the SCZs,

03:06:06.120 --> 03:06:09.640
the special economic zones,

03:06:09.640 --> 03:06:12.800
some of the most radical free market zones in the world.

03:06:12.800 --> 03:06:13.840
They've done it.

03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:16.440
And oftentimes within a generation,

03:06:16.440 --> 03:06:19.120
meaningful change start to happen, right?

03:06:19.120 --> 03:06:23.760
So here, what I'm working on is this concept of FASC.

03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:27.320
Some call it charter cities, Paul Romer.

03:06:27.320 --> 03:06:32.320
Others call it free cities.

03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:35.200
And I like to call it startup cities.

03:06:35.200 --> 03:06:37.600
What these are is for us to think about,

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:41.080
okay, if piecemeal legislation takes forever,

03:06:41.080 --> 03:06:44.000
while we have this demographic

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.960
that's growing faster and faster in Africa,

03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:48.160
there is a discrepancy here

03:06:48.160 --> 03:06:51.200
between the progress we're making

03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:55.280
to set the right environment for business to prop up

03:06:55.280 --> 03:06:58.840
and how many more people are coming to life,

03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:02.440
literally every day on the continent.

03:07:02.440 --> 03:07:03.880
There's a discrepancy here.

03:07:03.880 --> 03:07:06.520
And so the ticking bomb is going faster

03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:09.360
than the progress we can make.

03:07:09.360 --> 03:07:10.760
This is a problem.

03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:12.400
So what some of us are working on

03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:13.920
is this concept of startup cities

03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:18.440
and to say piecemeal legislation takes too long.

03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:20.120
How about we continue doing that work,

03:07:20.120 --> 03:07:21.960
which is essential and critical,

03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:24.800
but at the same time, can we think of zones?

03:07:24.800 --> 03:07:27.840
And I like to call them also common law zones

03:07:27.840 --> 03:07:32.800
where we basically try to have within the country

03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:35.200
an area where for business,

03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:37.280
I'm not talking about family law or any of that stuff.

03:07:37.280 --> 03:07:39.280
No one is touching your culture or anything like that.

03:07:39.280 --> 03:07:42.240
But we're just saying business-wise,

03:07:42.240 --> 03:07:45.160
an enclave where you have the best practices

03:07:45.160 --> 03:07:47.480
from around the world, including yours,

03:07:47.480 --> 03:07:51.680
in terms of what constitutes a great business environment

03:07:51.680 --> 03:07:54.760
and allow people in.

03:07:54.760 --> 03:07:57.760
Like it's, you know, you get in freely

03:07:57.760 --> 03:07:59.000
or nobody's forcing you to go,

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:00.760
nobody's forcing you to whatever.

03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:04.080
So basically you're to think about

03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:09.080
this rather unoccupied plot of land within a country.

03:08:09.280 --> 03:08:10.480
Think Dubai.

03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:12.800
On 110 acres of land,

03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:16.840
Dubai is thinking that in their case they're like,

03:08:16.840 --> 03:08:18.640
maybe they decided maybe Sharia law

03:08:18.640 --> 03:08:20.760
is not the best for business in their case.

03:08:20.760 --> 03:08:22.640
And they said, they looked around and were like, wow,

03:08:22.640 --> 03:08:25.000
but common law, especially British common law,

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:26.720
seems like a very good one.

03:08:26.720 --> 03:08:29.880
So at that point they decided for business only,

03:08:29.880 --> 03:08:31.280
not family or anything like that,

03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:33.560
which is gonna stand, you know, Sharia or whatever.

03:08:33.560 --> 03:08:38.560
And so they said, we are gonna bring in, you know,

03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:40.840
so they hired retired British common law judges

03:08:40.840 --> 03:08:44.240
to educate the law and train the people under there.

03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:47.320
And I'm oversimplifying, but at the end of the day,

03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:49.840
in within a generation,

03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:53.160
Dubai became one of the top

03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:55.480
international financial centers of the world.

03:08:55.480 --> 03:08:56.880
It is what it is today.

03:08:58.080 --> 03:08:59.000
So.

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:00.920
And in the case of the African nations,

03:09:00.920 --> 03:09:02.720
that zone can then spread.

03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:04.840
Yes, it can not only spread,

03:09:04.840 --> 03:09:06.560
but maybe let's say Senegal.

03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:07.720
Senegal was to go for this.

03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:09.240
Here you have this one,

03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:11.200
and then over there you have another zone.

03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:12.600
And then what they start to do

03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:14.600
is they're not all modeled the same way,

03:09:14.600 --> 03:09:16.000
because maybe this one is saying,

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.240
hey, we wanna attract more, I don't know,

03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:22.400
maybe we wanna attract more medical research, right?

03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:23.440
This one's gonna be saying,

03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:26.160
maybe we wanna attract more crypto,

03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:27.720
or maybe it's gonna be more like us,

03:09:27.720 --> 03:09:30.040
we wanna be more about religious or whatever.

03:09:30.040 --> 03:09:30.880
You know what I mean?

03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:32.800
So we wanted to fit more of this or that.

03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:36.800
And just kind of give the basics, the grounds,

03:09:36.800 --> 03:09:40.560
and then watch the magic happen on it, right?

03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:43.560
And so this is what we're working on.

03:09:43.560 --> 03:09:44.400
And the hope there,

03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:46.120
because some people, some people are like,

03:09:46.120 --> 03:09:47.720
you know, I know some people are like,

03:09:47.720 --> 03:09:49.080
you guys are crazy.

03:09:49.080 --> 03:09:50.720
But hey, I'm like, no,

03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:55.720
it's more or less the story of the Asian tigers.

03:09:55.840 --> 03:09:59.720
And most recently, most of China's progress,

03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:00.640
economically speaking,

03:10:00.640 --> 03:10:01.480
because some people might say,

03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:04.160
well, you don't want the China way of developing,

03:10:04.160 --> 03:10:05.440
you see, he is.

03:10:05.440 --> 03:10:08.880
Even then I say, and it's okay.

03:10:08.880 --> 03:10:10.720
You can always do better,

03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:15.720
but we cannot deny what the magic that they have accomplished.

03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:18.520
What they have accomplished is nothing short than a miracle.

03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:20.840
800 million people getting out of poverty

03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:21.680
in such a short amount of time.

03:10:21.680 --> 03:10:22.520
Yeah, exactly.

03:10:22.520 --> 03:10:25.640
So it's not, yeah, for the quality of life

03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:27.680
and the majority of the Chinese population.

03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:28.520
Yes.

03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:30.280
Does something like that happen without problems?

03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:31.760
Of course not.

03:10:31.760 --> 03:10:33.880
And so the next person to do something

03:10:33.920 --> 03:10:36.120
just actually gets to learn from lessons,

03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:37.440
from lessons, that's all.

03:10:37.440 --> 03:10:38.280
And leapfrog.

03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.400
And leapfrog, and leapfrog, exactly.

03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:41.960
So for me, this is a promise.

03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:44.280
And people are like, oh, but you guys are crazy.

03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:46.160
But I'm like, just like with everything,

03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:47.480
do you know how many attempts it took

03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:49.240
before the first flight,

03:10:49.240 --> 03:10:50.920
when the Wright brothers took off?

03:10:50.920 --> 03:10:52.720
Do you know how many?

03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:54.320
And that's important.

03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:56.720
You try, you crash, you try, you crash,

03:10:56.720 --> 03:10:59.440
but each time you're going up higher

03:10:59.440 --> 03:11:02.680
and you want to get up for once,

03:11:02.680 --> 03:11:04.120
then you stay up longer.

03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:06.720
And before you know it, you're doing all types of things.

03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:07.640
So here's the same thing.

03:11:07.640 --> 03:11:08.480
I tell people,

03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:13.320
listen, all I need is one success story.

03:11:14.760 --> 03:11:16.480
And then the sea change.

03:11:17.680 --> 03:11:20.560
People don't even wait for us, everybody.

03:11:20.560 --> 03:11:24.120
But this is hard because it's the first time.

03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:25.640
So, but the good news is

03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:28.520
there are many groups working on the continent.

03:11:28.520 --> 03:11:32.520
There are some groups in Zambia, there's a zone there,

03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:35.040
and folks are doing something like this in Nigeria.

03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.880
We were part of a project there in Nigeria.

03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:39.480
The one that I'm most excited about,

03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:41.480
I cannot disclose the name of the country yet,

03:11:41.480 --> 03:11:44.080
but my God, I'm so excited by it.

03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:46.240
And I just know, I just know, Lex,

03:11:46.240 --> 03:11:47.880
it's going to happen in our lifetime.

03:11:47.880 --> 03:11:48.720
I hope so.

03:11:48.720 --> 03:11:50.040
It's a really powerful vision.

03:11:50.040 --> 03:11:52.840
And, you know, it's not being dramatic to say

03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:56.560
that the future of humanity depends on that,

03:11:56.560 --> 03:11:59.400
your success, that success in Africa.

03:11:59.400 --> 03:12:02.120
It's such an important continent.

03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:03.440
It is.

03:12:03.440 --> 03:12:05.640
It's the continent where everything started.

03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:08.520
And I think it's the continent where we have,

03:12:08.520 --> 03:12:11.280
that continent has to finally, finally, finally thrive.

03:12:11.280 --> 03:12:13.480
We cannot, all of us call ourself

03:12:15.080 --> 03:12:18.440
an enlightened society as a whole.

03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:21.160
When you have such, when you have this,

03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:22.280
it's a humongous continent.

03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:23.800
Have you seen the size of it?

03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:25.760
You know?

03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:26.600
Yeah.

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:28.600
It's hard to fathom, actually.

03:12:28.600 --> 03:12:29.440
Yeah.

03:12:29.440 --> 03:12:30.260
Forget.

03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:31.100
Exactly.

03:12:31.100 --> 03:12:32.700
Such ingenious people.

03:12:32.700 --> 03:12:34.700
You know, sometimes I look at my people.

03:12:35.780 --> 03:12:36.740
I have to tell you,

03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:42.820
I'm so proud of them and the young people especially.

03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:45.020
And, you know, you would look at them

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:47.100
and you know, somebody said sometimes one day,

03:12:47.100 --> 03:12:48.140
and it was so true.

03:12:48.140 --> 03:12:51.340
They said, you know, we've seen poverty other places,

03:12:52.340 --> 03:12:57.020
but here it is just, maybe somebody doesn't have money,

03:12:57.020 --> 03:13:00.140
but they have dignity and it's true.

03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:00.980
Yeah.

03:13:01.820 --> 03:13:03.380
So everything else we can handle and we will handle.

03:13:03.380 --> 03:13:05.140
You have to mark my word for this.

03:13:05.140 --> 03:13:06.620
This is gonna happen.

03:13:06.620 --> 03:13:08.820
And our youth is amazing.

03:13:09.660 --> 03:13:11.220
You should see them.

03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:13.540
So full of creativity and it doesn't matter.

03:13:13.540 --> 03:13:15.180
You know, you were telling me what makes you different.

03:13:15.180 --> 03:13:16.700
Many things makes us all different.

03:13:16.700 --> 03:13:18.660
You know, the Rwandans are very different

03:13:18.660 --> 03:13:21.740
from the West Africans that we are.

03:13:21.740 --> 03:13:24.540
Rwandans, for example, never dance with their hips.

03:13:24.540 --> 03:13:27.420
They dance more like, you know, with this part of a body.

03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:30.020
West Africans hips?

03:13:30.020 --> 03:13:32.260
Us, it's hips all over the place all the time.

03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:34.660
And it's, you know, more jumping stuff like that.

03:13:34.660 --> 03:13:36.420
In Rwanda, you feel it's more like, you know,

03:13:36.420 --> 03:13:39.380
I mean, they remind me more of, you know, the ballet thing.

03:13:40.420 --> 03:13:43.580
Rwandans have a sense where, you know, they don't eat in a,

03:13:43.580 --> 03:13:45.260
you know, more so much in public.

03:13:45.260 --> 03:13:47.980
It's not very well, it's something you do.

03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:49.540
Us, we are the West Africans.

03:13:49.540 --> 03:13:50.380
We like to be loud.

03:13:50.380 --> 03:13:52.460
We're almost like the Italians of the continent.

03:13:52.460 --> 03:13:55.220
And then the Rwandans are more like, you know,

03:13:55.220 --> 03:13:58.500
the Swiss of the country even looks like Switzerland.

03:13:58.500 --> 03:14:00.860
I mean, we're so different from one group to another.

03:14:00.860 --> 03:14:02.940
Then you go to the Congo and you see these guys.

03:14:02.940 --> 03:14:03.780
They're so crazy.

03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:05.580
The way they dress, I mean, les sapeurs.

03:14:05.580 --> 03:14:08.540
So we are a very different bunch.

03:14:08.540 --> 03:14:11.020
But you know what I love about us,

03:14:11.020 --> 03:14:12.420
what I love about my people?

03:14:14.740 --> 03:14:19.740
We are the manifestation of what resiliency means.

03:14:21.820 --> 03:14:25.980
And so everything we need is there.

03:14:26.820 --> 03:14:28.220
Everything we need is there.

03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:32.420
I will say that there is nothing wrong with the seed.

03:14:32.420 --> 03:14:34.660
Everything that's wrong with us

03:14:35.980 --> 03:14:39.300
is that pot that we put around us.

03:14:39.300 --> 03:14:41.140
So we're tired of being bonsai people.

03:14:43.180 --> 03:14:45.820
We need to be the tallest trees in the forest

03:14:45.820 --> 03:14:47.180
that we were designed to be.

03:14:47.180 --> 03:14:48.100
And so-

03:14:48.100 --> 03:14:49.500
And that can be fixed.

03:14:49.500 --> 03:14:50.340
And that can be fixed.

03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:51.180
And that's the beauty of it.

03:14:51.180 --> 03:14:54.780
And that's why I am so, I'm almost dizzy with,

03:14:54.780 --> 03:14:57.540
I get dizzy with hope.

03:14:57.580 --> 03:14:59.180
I know my history.

03:14:59.180 --> 03:15:03.700
I know my economics, my fellow humans and all of that.

03:15:03.700 --> 03:15:06.420
And we know that there's an unfailing recipe.

03:15:08.820 --> 03:15:10.100
And when it comes to that recipe,

03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:11.780
we have the hardest part of it.

03:15:13.260 --> 03:15:16.380
The one missing ingredient, which is the free markets.

03:15:18.300 --> 03:15:23.180
As we go around and talk and people start to understand

03:15:23.180 --> 03:15:25.540
and each country tries to figure out,

03:15:25.540 --> 03:15:28.260
okay, where do we go there from here?

03:15:29.740 --> 03:15:34.740
I know that I will die with my continent

03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:38.940
having taken the right shift for a turn.

03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:40.260
I don't have to see where it ends

03:15:40.260 --> 03:15:42.340
because I cannot in my wildest dream

03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:44.140
imagine where it's gonna end.

03:15:44.140 --> 03:15:47.700
But I know it's gonna be, yeah.

03:15:47.700 --> 03:15:52.700
So all my only job is to get this message out

03:15:53.420 --> 03:15:56.380
and then let my people do with it what they wanna do.

03:15:56.380 --> 03:15:57.220
That's all.

03:15:57.220 --> 03:15:59.380
Yeah, the scale of impact is just boundless.

03:15:59.380 --> 03:16:00.220
It's kind of cool.

03:16:00.220 --> 03:16:02.620
I mean, sometimes we think about individual problems

03:16:02.620 --> 03:16:03.580
and how do we solve them?

03:16:03.580 --> 03:16:05.820
We look up at certain individuals

03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:08.900
like the, I don't know, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

03:16:08.900 --> 03:16:12.740
But it's so much more powerful to just,

03:16:12.740 --> 03:16:15.220
without knowing what they will do,

03:16:15.220 --> 03:16:19.940
give the freedom to millions,

03:16:19.980 --> 03:16:22.220
to hundreds of millions of people

03:16:22.220 --> 03:16:23.900
to do whatever the hell they're gonna do.

03:16:23.900 --> 03:16:25.220
Can you imagine?

03:16:25.220 --> 03:16:26.500
Can you just imagine?

03:16:26.500 --> 03:16:27.740
It's truly, truly exciting.

03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:30.180
So in that sense, the work you're doing,

03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:33.620
it's unimaginable the kind of impact it would have.

03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:36.220
Now, going back to that hard moment,

03:16:36.220 --> 03:16:38.180
this dark place you went in,

03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:40.260
in your mind, in your personal life story,

03:16:40.260 --> 03:16:41.920
you lost your husband,

03:16:42.940 --> 03:16:45.380
what gave you strength during that time?

03:16:45.380 --> 03:16:49.100
What were the places you went to your mind

03:16:49.180 --> 03:16:52.860
in terms of personal struggle,

03:16:52.860 --> 03:16:54.780
in terms of maybe even depression

03:16:54.780 --> 03:16:58.020
or these kinds of struggles?

03:16:58.020 --> 03:17:01.300
I think for me, when my person passed away,

03:17:03.100 --> 03:17:06.260
I went to,

03:17:08.260 --> 03:17:10.100
maybe my friends could see what was going on,

03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:11.900
maybe they couldn't, I don't know.

03:17:11.900 --> 03:17:14.540
But on the surface, I looked like I was fine.

03:17:14.540 --> 03:17:16.340
But what happened is the only thing I think

03:17:16.420 --> 03:17:18.700
that kept me around as I thought about it

03:17:19.940 --> 03:17:24.300
was the job to be done.

03:17:26.940 --> 03:17:31.340
These women relied on me and I was no longer free.

03:17:31.340 --> 03:17:32.460
I did not own myself.

03:17:32.460 --> 03:17:33.500
And they said it in those words,

03:17:33.500 --> 03:17:35.060
you don't own yourself anymore.

03:17:36.300 --> 03:17:41.300
And it was true, but it helped me because I was able to,

03:17:43.820 --> 03:17:45.900
sometimes whatever it takes to keep you around,

03:17:45.900 --> 03:17:47.140
whatever it takes.

03:17:47.140 --> 03:17:48.340
And that's what I would tell people

03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:51.860
who feel like they can't just push one more push

03:17:51.860 --> 03:17:54.180
and they think they need to end it.

03:17:54.180 --> 03:17:55.860
At that point, whatever it takes,

03:17:55.860 --> 03:17:58.020
just stick around for one more second

03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:00.580
because the next second, you know.

03:18:00.580 --> 03:18:04.220
So I stuck around because of duty.

03:18:04.220 --> 03:18:06.360
I felt a very strong sense of duty.

03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:10.460
My duty was in this case, I think stronger than my pain.

03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:13.700
I don't know how that was possible, but it was.

03:18:14.700 --> 03:18:19.700
And I just pushed my grief under the rug for years.

03:18:20.980 --> 03:18:22.740
For years, I worked like a mad lady.

03:18:23.980 --> 03:18:28.060
I would travel, I would do three states in three days,

03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:30.940
landing at two in the morning around five or six,

03:18:30.940 --> 03:18:33.020
going to ride along with our distributors

03:18:33.020 --> 03:18:35.460
because it was beverage and just keep going

03:18:35.460 --> 03:18:36.540
and have all of this energy

03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:38.380
and look like everything is fine.

03:18:38.380 --> 03:18:40.700
But what happened was just like I was focused on the job

03:18:40.700 --> 03:18:41.540
to be done.

03:18:41.540 --> 03:18:43.740
And sometimes it is okay to do that.

03:18:43.740 --> 03:18:46.860
At least for me, it was my safety.

03:18:46.860 --> 03:18:47.940
You know, like when you're in the water

03:18:47.940 --> 03:18:49.020
and you're about to sink

03:18:49.020 --> 03:18:51.380
and they throw you that round thing,

03:18:51.380 --> 03:18:53.500
I don't know how you call it.

03:18:53.500 --> 03:18:54.340
You know that, you know.

03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:56.220
The thing that keeps you afloat, you mean?

03:18:56.220 --> 03:18:57.300
Yes, yes, the floater.

03:18:57.300 --> 03:18:58.140
It's the floater.

03:18:58.140 --> 03:18:58.980
Yeah, whatever.

03:18:58.980 --> 03:19:02.020
Listen, between the two of us, we're still terrible.

03:19:02.020 --> 03:19:02.860
We're bad.

03:19:02.860 --> 03:19:04.980
So they sent you, you, you.

03:19:04.980 --> 03:19:06.340
I know exactly what you mean.

03:19:06.340 --> 03:19:07.180
Exactly, right?

03:19:07.180 --> 03:19:08.020
So you understand me.

03:19:08.020 --> 03:19:10.580
So they sent you that thing and you just,

03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:12.620
I was just hanging on to it.

03:19:12.620 --> 03:19:14.460
My life depended on this thing.

03:19:14.460 --> 03:19:17.540
So these women, they carried me.

03:19:17.540 --> 03:19:19.260
They carried me.

03:19:19.260 --> 03:19:23.580
And with time, things are moving forward.

03:19:23.580 --> 03:19:26.900
And at some point I went into really, really deep depression

03:19:26.900 --> 03:19:29.660
and I went into a very dark place,

03:19:29.660 --> 03:19:31.860
even darker than the one I think I came from.

03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:35.180
Because by that time, I had worked for years

03:19:35.180 --> 03:19:37.940
on this company and now some other things was happening.

03:19:37.940 --> 03:19:42.100
And around that time, it's also when I was discovering

03:19:42.100 --> 03:19:45.100
a lot of what we talked about today

03:19:45.100 --> 03:19:47.940
about what makes a country rich.

03:19:47.940 --> 03:19:52.780
And for me to understand that my network,

03:19:52.780 --> 03:19:56.220
I was very much into left-oriented network.

03:19:57.260 --> 03:20:02.260
And to just start to see all of this,

03:20:03.660 --> 03:20:05.660
I tried to address it to realize that

03:20:05.660 --> 03:20:07.340
many of these people would prefer

03:20:07.340 --> 03:20:11.980
to go running for the hills than accept for a moment

03:20:11.980 --> 03:20:14.740
that maybe capitalism might be part of a solution

03:20:14.740 --> 03:20:17.260
when many of them were involved in capitalism.

03:20:18.260 --> 03:20:21.300
So that was a hard time.

03:20:22.500 --> 03:20:26.540
At some point I was, yeah, so many things were happening

03:20:26.540 --> 03:20:31.540
around that time that basically shook up everything for me.

03:20:33.580 --> 03:20:35.620
One is hard to talk about because it's very personal

03:20:35.620 --> 03:20:39.580
and the person that I was having a problem with

03:20:39.580 --> 03:20:41.740
passed away last year.

03:20:41.740 --> 03:20:45.860
And I'm one to always say, leave the dead alone.

03:20:45.860 --> 03:20:48.740
So because of that, I won't speak about it,

03:20:48.740 --> 03:20:51.100
but there too having a major fallout

03:20:51.100 --> 03:20:53.540
with somebody who was like a father figure for me,

03:20:53.540 --> 03:20:55.820
somebody that I completely trusted.

03:20:55.820 --> 03:20:59.300
And so at some point you just ask yourself,

03:20:59.300 --> 03:21:01.140
was my whole life built on a lie?

03:21:02.140 --> 03:21:02.980
Right?

03:21:03.980 --> 03:21:07.980
And then you're confused and then you become confused.

03:21:07.980 --> 03:21:11.780
And then at some point you lose 90% of your friends

03:21:11.780 --> 03:21:13.340
because of, ideologically speaking,

03:21:13.340 --> 03:21:14.540
it doesn't work anymore.

03:21:17.740 --> 03:21:22.740
Then you just wonder, have I been asleep this whole time?

03:21:23.940 --> 03:21:24.980
And then you start to wonder,

03:21:24.980 --> 03:21:26.620
remember when you asked me, who am I?

03:21:26.620 --> 03:21:30.260
At some point, Lex, I literally was like a candy can,

03:21:30.260 --> 03:21:32.460
I literally was like a candle in the wind.

03:21:33.740 --> 03:21:35.700
I felt like I was a candle in the wind.

03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:38.980
And it was very hard to come back from that.

03:21:38.980 --> 03:21:43.980
And the few people I talk to about this,

03:21:43.980 --> 03:21:45.580
they have a hardest time understanding

03:21:45.580 --> 03:21:48.180
or even believing it because they're like, you?

03:21:48.180 --> 03:21:50.060
I'm like, yes, me.

03:21:50.060 --> 03:21:52.380
I used to be a candle in the wind.

03:21:52.380 --> 03:21:53.740
What got you out?

03:21:53.740 --> 03:21:55.540
What made you overcome that?

03:21:55.540 --> 03:21:58.500
My current husband, my current husband.

03:21:58.500 --> 03:21:59.340
Love?

03:21:59.980 --> 03:22:02.020
See, when I tell you love is the answer.

03:22:02.020 --> 03:22:04.340
But him, he came with love,

03:22:04.340 --> 03:22:09.340
but he also came with really helping me figure out the world.

03:22:10.260 --> 03:22:11.940
So what Michael, because that's him,

03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:13.940
who we're talking about, Michael Strong.

03:22:15.180 --> 03:22:16.500
That must be special.

03:22:16.500 --> 03:22:18.980
He's so special, he's so special.

03:22:18.980 --> 03:22:21.460
So you have no idea how special he is.

03:22:21.460 --> 03:22:25.020
But Michael, the reason why I have such love,

03:22:25.020 --> 03:22:26.940
respect and admiration for my husband,

03:22:26.940 --> 03:22:28.620
I'll never say it enough,

03:22:28.620 --> 03:22:32.420
is because actually it's one of those relationships

03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:37.460
that got built based on intellect first.

03:22:37.460 --> 03:22:41.380
You see, at some point I was in the position

03:22:41.380 --> 03:22:43.580
where I could start a foundation

03:22:44.580 --> 03:22:46.940
after having built my first business.

03:22:46.940 --> 03:22:51.940
And all I wanted was an ability to power

03:22:52.940 --> 03:22:57.940
as many, especially women, African women entrepreneurs,

03:22:58.980 --> 03:23:01.700
like me a few years ago, before then,

03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:04.500
to do something like I was able to do.

03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:07.340
Bring back to the world some really cool aspects

03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:10.100
of our culture built into a really cool brand,

03:23:10.100 --> 03:23:11.700
21st century type.

03:23:11.700 --> 03:23:12.780
That's what I wanted to do.

03:23:12.780 --> 03:23:15.580
Because the more I could promote women like that

03:23:15.580 --> 03:23:17.380
and put steam behind them,

03:23:17.380 --> 03:23:21.020
and the more my dream envisioned for a respected Africa,

03:23:21.020 --> 03:23:22.540
a prosperous Africa would happen.

03:23:22.540 --> 03:23:24.660
Back then, that's what I wanted.

03:23:24.660 --> 03:23:28.980
And around me, this was also part of the whole crisis

03:23:28.980 --> 03:23:31.980
of ideologies I had back then.

03:23:31.980 --> 03:23:36.380
Everybody was like, well, we should be just doing grants.

03:23:37.580 --> 03:23:40.660
And I knew that my people didn't need grants.

03:23:40.660 --> 03:23:42.260
They didn't need like a handout.

03:23:43.940 --> 03:23:46.060
They don't want your charity.

03:23:46.060 --> 03:23:47.660
I didn't want charity.

03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:51.060
I wanted someone who could work with me on my accounting.

03:23:51.060 --> 03:23:53.940
I wanted somebody who could help me

03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:55.860
brainstorm marketing-wise.

03:23:55.860 --> 03:23:59.420
I wanted somebody, or I needed to raise money

03:23:59.420 --> 03:24:03.340
to pay my research and development guy

03:24:03.340 --> 03:24:08.020
to help me take the juices from my grandma's recipe

03:24:08.020 --> 03:24:10.700
to something that can be shelf stable.

03:24:13.620 --> 03:24:15.260
I needed coaching.

03:24:15.260 --> 03:24:17.500
These are all the things that I needed

03:24:18.460 --> 03:24:19.300
to make my dream happen.

03:24:19.300 --> 03:24:20.980
I didn't want you to give me some crap for free.

03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:21.940
That's not what I want.

03:24:21.940 --> 03:24:24.860
I just want to be able to build my business

03:24:24.860 --> 03:24:27.300
with all the things that business building needs.

03:24:27.300 --> 03:24:30.460
And so that's what I wanted to do,

03:24:30.460 --> 03:24:32.140
and it's what was needed.

03:24:32.140 --> 03:24:36.420
And so Michael, somebody found out about what I was doing

03:24:36.420 --> 03:24:37.820
because back in the days in San Francisco,

03:24:37.820 --> 03:24:39.500
they would write a lot about me and everything.

03:24:39.500 --> 03:24:43.660
And so Michael, along with John Mackey,

03:24:43.660 --> 03:24:44.940
the founder of Whole Foods Market,

03:24:44.940 --> 03:24:48.100
they had a nonprofit called Flow,

03:24:48.100 --> 03:24:49.940
and it's all about human flourishing.

03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:52.660
They want for people, everybody to get this choice,

03:24:52.660 --> 03:24:55.140
this ability to be able to get to a point in their life

03:24:55.140 --> 03:24:56.900
where they're in complete flow.

03:24:56.900 --> 03:24:59.060
It's Michael, just Michael.

03:24:59.060 --> 03:25:00.900
Michael is the only one who could say that last name.

03:25:00.900 --> 03:25:02.460
But you know, the whole concept of flow,

03:25:02.460 --> 03:25:03.500
when you're in a state of flow,

03:25:03.500 --> 03:25:06.420
you're basically doing what you're supposed to do,

03:25:06.420 --> 03:25:07.460
the way you're supposed to do it,

03:25:07.460 --> 03:25:08.420
with the people who are supposed to do it.

03:25:08.420 --> 03:25:10.420
This whole concept of flow,

03:25:10.420 --> 03:25:12.860
it's human flourishing at its highest.

03:25:12.900 --> 03:25:15.300
So, you know, so I meet with this man.

03:25:16.980 --> 03:25:21.620
Okay, so he finds me, his people find me.

03:25:21.620 --> 03:25:23.300
And then there was a program

03:25:23.300 --> 03:25:26.460
where it was all about accelerating women entrepreneurs.

03:25:26.460 --> 03:25:29.700
So it's during these times that I'm starting now

03:25:29.700 --> 03:25:30.540
to see things.

03:25:30.540 --> 03:25:33.620
That's when actually all of this stuff that I noticed,

03:25:33.620 --> 03:25:35.860
how come here it takes me all of this time

03:25:35.860 --> 03:25:37.540
to start my business, over there's 20 minutes,

03:25:37.540 --> 03:25:39.580
here it's free, over there's thousands of dollars,

03:25:39.580 --> 03:25:41.180
all of this nonsense that I just took,

03:25:41.180 --> 03:25:42.500
oh, maybe it's just because we're messed up,

03:25:42.940 --> 03:25:45.420
we're poor, that's why everything is so messed up.

03:25:45.420 --> 03:25:48.020
Whoa, these people are introducing me to concepts.

03:25:48.020 --> 03:25:50.860
I'm like, first of all, I'm like, oh, really?

03:25:51.780 --> 03:25:55.260
What did you call the doing business in there?

03:25:55.260 --> 03:25:56.100
What is that?

03:25:57.020 --> 03:25:58.900
You know, all of this stuff.

03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:02.060
And I'm starting to discover this whole other body of work.

03:26:03.180 --> 03:26:04.460
What, that the free markets,

03:26:04.460 --> 03:26:06.980
like this thing that I was sensing,

03:26:06.980 --> 03:26:08.340
this environment that I was sensing

03:26:08.340 --> 03:26:11.060
that it was different around me.

03:26:11.060 --> 03:26:13.900
And that they called it the free markets over here,

03:26:13.900 --> 03:26:15.700
and over there, that.

03:26:15.700 --> 03:26:18.500
And then I started to butt head those ideas

03:26:18.500 --> 03:26:21.780
with the ideas that I was fed with before that.

03:26:21.780 --> 03:26:23.860
And the evidence won.

03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:25.700
And further, more than the evidence,

03:26:25.700 --> 03:26:29.340
the evidence combined with my lived experience,

03:26:29.340 --> 03:26:30.740
it was so powerful.

03:26:30.740 --> 03:26:34.100
So I basically started understanding these ideas

03:26:34.100 --> 03:26:36.460
from the most visceral part of my body,

03:26:36.460 --> 03:26:37.860
you know, of my being.

03:26:38.860 --> 03:26:41.060
And it makes sense.

03:26:41.060 --> 03:26:45.380
So Michael, Michael helped me find the solution,

03:26:45.380 --> 03:26:49.900
the answer to my lifelong little girl's question

03:26:49.900 --> 03:26:52.220
of why do they have this and we don't?

03:26:52.220 --> 03:26:55.540
And how do some countries like mine be poor

03:26:55.540 --> 03:26:57.540
while others are rich?

03:26:57.540 --> 03:27:01.540
And with understanding all of that,

03:27:02.460 --> 03:27:07.460
the greatest, biggest sense of liberation

03:27:08.340 --> 03:27:09.300
came upon me.

03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:12.500
Like, I have no other word to describe that.

03:27:13.860 --> 03:27:16.900
True liberation, the liberation that comes from a peer

03:27:16.900 --> 03:27:21.900
to finally understand and be vindicated in your own,

03:27:24.420 --> 03:27:29.180
you know, in your own deep knowing

03:27:29.180 --> 03:27:32.540
or feeling that they're not,

03:27:32.540 --> 03:27:33.740
what they're saying is not true.

03:27:33.740 --> 03:27:35.180
You're not the problem.

03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:36.700
It's not you.

03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:38.660
There's something else.

03:27:38.660 --> 03:27:41.340
And when I discovered that, my whole life changed.

03:27:41.340 --> 03:27:44.820
So, and since then, I have been very serious

03:27:44.820 --> 03:27:46.700
about going deeper and deeper and deeper

03:27:46.700 --> 03:27:49.020
into my understanding of all of this,

03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:52.100
understanding the subtlety.

03:27:52.100 --> 03:27:53.940
At some point, I was very angry

03:27:53.940 --> 03:27:55.740
about the liberators of Africa

03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:58.460
because I was like, yes, you helped liberate us,

03:27:58.460 --> 03:28:00.300
but just to keep us in this marism,

03:28:01.260 --> 03:28:03.380
I was angry for longest time.

03:28:03.380 --> 03:28:07.260
And then eventually you have to engage empathy

03:28:07.260 --> 03:28:10.220
and love to put yourself in their shoes

03:28:10.220 --> 03:28:13.340
and try to understand the time at which they were living.

03:28:13.340 --> 03:28:14.580
And that got me onto a journey

03:28:14.580 --> 03:28:17.180
of trying to understand history more.

03:28:17.180 --> 03:28:18.220
That's how I understood.

03:28:18.220 --> 03:28:20.460
I was able to go beyond just these liberators

03:28:20.460 --> 03:28:23.660
and try to understand and rebuild the world around them

03:28:23.660 --> 03:28:28.660
at the macro and also at the macro level.

03:28:29.180 --> 03:28:31.820
Just really, you have to try to walk in their shoes.

03:28:32.820 --> 03:28:36.580
And from there, finally separate the baby with a bathwater

03:28:36.580 --> 03:28:38.420
that they were not able to do back then.

03:28:38.420 --> 03:28:41.660
That's why today, I'm sorry, but I have no patience

03:28:41.660 --> 03:28:45.180
for the BLM organizers, founders, especially founders.

03:28:45.180 --> 03:28:46.100
I don't know what the organizers think,

03:28:46.100 --> 03:28:48.580
but the founders told us what they stand for.

03:28:48.580 --> 03:28:51.580
And I say, guys, don't make that same mistake again.

03:28:51.580 --> 03:28:52.860
If you're serious about this,

03:28:52.860 --> 03:28:54.620
you cannot make the same mistake.

03:28:56.100 --> 03:29:00.060
The liberators of Africa, they have an excuse.

03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:00.900
We didn't know better.

03:29:01.140 --> 03:29:04.980
It was so easy back then to conflate everything.

03:29:04.980 --> 03:29:08.380
But today, you, me, anybody alive,

03:29:08.380 --> 03:29:12.500
cannot with a straight face embrace Marxist socialist ideas,

03:29:12.500 --> 03:29:16.460
especially when they're claiming

03:29:16.460 --> 03:29:20.340
that they want people to thrive.

03:29:20.340 --> 03:29:22.500
No, you can't, I'm sorry.

03:29:22.500 --> 03:29:26.060
And I will hold your feet up to the fire on that one.

03:29:26.060 --> 03:29:28.060
I will, I will, and that's what I'm doing.

03:29:28.060 --> 03:29:29.180
They will give me a lot of grief for this,

03:29:29.180 --> 03:29:30.020
but guess what?

03:29:30.020 --> 03:29:30.860
I could care less.

03:29:31.860 --> 03:29:33.900
Because we have an entire population

03:29:35.020 --> 03:29:39.740
to help rise out of poverty into prosperity,

03:29:39.740 --> 03:29:43.940
where they become co-creators,

03:29:43.940 --> 03:29:46.700
global co-creators of innovation.

03:29:48.220 --> 03:29:51.900
And those ideas give you hope for the place you love,

03:29:51.900 --> 03:29:53.700
for Senegal, for Africa.

03:29:53.700 --> 03:29:55.540
They do, they do.

03:29:55.540 --> 03:29:56.700
The world I live in,

03:29:57.580 --> 03:30:01.380
the new centers of culture and fashion are in Dakar.

03:30:01.380 --> 03:30:06.380
The new centers of tech and crypto even

03:30:10.020 --> 03:30:12.220
is somewhere, maybe Nigeria.

03:30:12.220 --> 03:30:15.020
So you see that future, you see that future clearly.

03:30:15.020 --> 03:30:17.580
I do, I do, I do.

03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:20.060
It's a beautiful thing, and it's also beautiful

03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:23.500
to see that the space of these really powerful ideas

03:30:23.500 --> 03:30:25.260
is where you also fall in love.

03:30:25.260 --> 03:30:27.100
You also fall in love.

03:30:27.100 --> 03:30:28.820
So at the intersection.

03:30:28.820 --> 03:30:31.860
At the intersection, Michael and I would spend hours

03:30:31.860 --> 03:30:33.140
talking about all of these ideas,

03:30:33.140 --> 03:30:34.700
and I would be like, but what about this?

03:30:34.700 --> 03:30:36.020
No, it doesn't make any sense.

03:30:36.020 --> 03:30:37.220
No, no, no, oh no.

03:30:37.220 --> 03:30:42.220
And then hours every single day for months, Lex.

03:30:42.460 --> 03:30:45.020
And then from there, our love was born.

03:30:45.020 --> 03:30:48.180
Because I tell people, for us, love is not about

03:30:48.180 --> 03:30:50.500
looking someone in the eyes, like they all think,

03:30:50.500 --> 03:30:52.500
but it's about we look in one direction,

03:30:52.500 --> 03:30:53.940
and in this case, it's this vision,

03:30:53.980 --> 03:30:55.940
what we know to be possible and true.

03:30:55.940 --> 03:30:58.500
If only you liberate people.

03:30:59.660 --> 03:31:01.540
What we know to be true and possible.

03:31:02.580 --> 03:31:04.900
All of us are miracles walking around.

03:31:04.900 --> 03:31:08.660
Every time I get on a plane, it's a miracle of engineering.

03:31:09.700 --> 03:31:11.180
All the things we're able to do, you know,

03:31:11.180 --> 03:31:13.420
now when they do operation on your teeth,

03:31:13.420 --> 03:31:16.740
how they're able to put the pain down away.

03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:18.020
All of this is us.

03:31:18.020 --> 03:31:19.460
You're working on these robots.

03:31:20.420 --> 03:31:22.900
This, this, this inside here.

03:31:22.940 --> 03:31:23.980
Humans are amazing.

03:31:23.980 --> 03:31:24.820
I know.

03:31:24.820 --> 03:31:27.260
So that's why I went, and when it works in great tandem

03:31:27.260 --> 03:31:30.420
with this guy, these two working together.

03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:31.260
Yeah.

03:31:31.260 --> 03:31:32.100
Ooh.

03:31:32.100 --> 03:31:32.940
Watch out.

03:31:32.940 --> 03:31:33.780
There's nothing we can't accomplish.

03:31:33.780 --> 03:31:35.220
Nothing, nothing.

03:31:35.220 --> 03:31:37.780
Look, you're one of the most incredible people

03:31:37.780 --> 03:31:38.620
I've ever talked to, I've ever met.

03:31:38.620 --> 03:31:39.780
Oh, you say that.

03:31:39.780 --> 03:31:41.220
You've met everybody.

03:31:41.220 --> 03:31:42.060
Thank you so much.

03:31:42.060 --> 03:31:43.540
This was truly an honor.

03:31:43.540 --> 03:31:44.660
Thank you for everything you're doing.

03:31:44.660 --> 03:31:46.860
Thank you for the fire that burns within you.

03:31:46.860 --> 03:31:49.100
And it's just a passion you have for a place

03:31:49.100 --> 03:31:52.060
that's going to, I think, define the future of humanity.

03:31:52.060 --> 03:31:53.340
So thank you for everything you're doing.

03:31:53.340 --> 03:31:54.180
Thank you for talking to me.

03:31:54.180 --> 03:31:55.020
Thank you.

03:31:55.020 --> 03:31:55.860
Thank you to you.

03:31:55.860 --> 03:31:57.780
And sometimes I hope this fire doesn't consume me.

03:31:57.780 --> 03:31:59.300
That's how much it is.

03:31:59.300 --> 03:32:02.380
But I am grateful to you for this.

03:32:02.380 --> 03:32:04.660
And yeah, thank you for,

03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:06.660
I know you don't do a lot of these, you know,

03:32:06.660 --> 03:32:09.100
I am, it's this type of interviews.

03:32:09.100 --> 03:32:11.700
Maybe I don't know, but I'm so, so happy to be here.

03:32:11.700 --> 03:32:15.020
You mean fun, inspiring, powerful interviews?

03:32:15.020 --> 03:32:15.860
Yes.

03:32:15.860 --> 03:32:16.700
I need to do more.

03:32:16.700 --> 03:32:17.540
You're amazing.

03:32:17.540 --> 03:32:18.620
I don't know, because at first I was like,

03:32:18.620 --> 03:32:20.140
Lex Fridman, really?

03:32:20.140 --> 03:32:20.980
Yeah, really?

03:32:21.140 --> 03:32:23.020
How's this going to go?

03:32:23.020 --> 03:32:24.500
I'm going to talk to Lex and go all crazy.

03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:27.740
I think you need to work on your unconscious bias.

03:32:27.740 --> 03:32:28.580
Right?

03:32:29.900 --> 03:32:30.740
All right.

03:32:30.740 --> 03:32:31.580
Thank you, Magat.

03:32:31.580 --> 03:32:32.420
You're the best.

03:32:32.420 --> 03:32:33.260
Thank you.

03:32:33.260 --> 03:32:34.540
Thank you so much.

03:32:34.540 --> 03:32:37.540
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magat Wade.

And now let me leave you with some words

03:32:43.620 --> 03:32:44.940
from Nelson Mandela.

03:32:46.020 --> 03:32:48.500
Money won't create success.

03:32:48.500 --> 03:32:51.100
The freedom to make it will.

03:32:52.180 --> 03:32:55.020
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
