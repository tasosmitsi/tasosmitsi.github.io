00:00.000 --> 00:03.100
I have anal beads that are communicating

00:03.100 --> 00:04.920
with stockfish via Bluetooth.

00:04.920 --> 00:05.760
We'll get to that.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.820
If you cheat, you play God.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.440
You decide when the game is over.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.040
You can fake bad moves.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.240
You can fake everything.

00:16.240 --> 00:19.120
You can even, if you're cheating quote unquote

00:19.120 --> 00:21.760
the right way, you're gonna lose plenty of games.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.120
To avoid getting detected.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.280
What's the probability that Hans cheated

00:25.280 --> 00:27.700
over the board against Magnus in St. Louis?

00:27.700 --> 00:30.080
I think day by day,

00:31.200 --> 00:35.340
the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more

00:35.340 --> 00:39.900
that he's cheated, like how Magnus said,

00:39.900 --> 00:42.920
more than he said and more recently.

00:45.740 --> 00:48.300
The following is a conversation with Levi Rosman,

00:48.300 --> 00:50.820
also known as Gotham Chess.

00:50.820 --> 00:54.260
He's a professional chess player and educator.

00:54.260 --> 00:57.220
I highly recommend you check out his YouTube channel

00:57.260 --> 01:00.220
called Gotham Chess.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.100
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.220
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:04.220 --> 01:05.500
in the description.

01:05.500 --> 01:09.580
And now dear friends, here's Levi Rosman.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.200
You're known for being able to guess people's ELO rating.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.040
So what do you think?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.380
Just by looking at my face, deep into my eyes,

01:16.340 --> 01:18.500
what's my ELO rating?

01:18.500 --> 01:19.340
Here, I'll help you.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.520
I'll do E4 for the listener.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.780
I actually read that stockfish prefers E4.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.420
Does it really?

01:28.420 --> 01:29.500
I actually didn't know that.

01:29.500 --> 01:33.140
Because it maximizes the number of tactical options.

01:33.140 --> 01:34.380
So that makes sense.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.740
The right answer is 3,400, which is I believe stockfish.

01:39.020 --> 01:40.860
You guessed people's ELO chest rating.

01:40.860 --> 01:41.980
What's that take?

01:41.980 --> 01:43.100
How hard is it to do that?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.020
And like, how would you actually do that?

01:45.020 --> 01:47.580
Like what are telltale signs of red flags

01:47.580 --> 01:49.920
about a person at different ratings?

01:49.920 --> 01:52.060
Is there something you look for?

01:52.060 --> 01:54.980
Yeah, I think you can separate it something like

01:54.980 --> 01:58.020
the very first, the zero to about 8,900.

01:58.020 --> 01:59.780
For simplicity sake, I'm gonna use

01:59.780 --> 02:01.220
the chess.com rating system

02:01.220 --> 02:03.760
because Lee Chess is slightly different.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.820
It tends to go two, 300 points higher than chess.com.

02:07.820 --> 02:10.060
Sometimes even four, 500 points higher.

02:10.060 --> 02:10.960
But then it catches up.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.940
They catch up around 22, 2300, I would say.

02:13.940 --> 02:15.340
What's chess.com?

02:15.340 --> 02:17.020
What's Lee Chess?

02:17.020 --> 02:20.040
Can you like explain what the difference is

02:20.040 --> 02:20.880
and what they are?

02:20.880 --> 02:23.520
They're two chess websites.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.240
Good starting point.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.680
Yes, chess.com is, it has obviously the free option

02:29.680 --> 02:31.180
where you can play games,

02:31.180 --> 02:33.480
you get some sort of puzzles every single day,

02:33.480 --> 02:35.580
you get some sort of lessons every single day.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.600
But then they have tiered memberships

02:37.600 --> 02:39.560
where you can pay annually or per month

02:39.560 --> 02:42.240
that you can unlock all the other features.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.060
And-

02:43.060 --> 02:43.900
Like what?

02:43.900 --> 02:46.360
Like for training, for like puzzles and all that kind of stuff?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.540
Yeah, they have unlimited puzzles,

02:47.540 --> 02:50.080
but they also have, their biggest selling point for sure

02:50.120 --> 02:53.040
is like a dedicated game review

02:53.040 --> 02:56.080
that it's like very flashy and sophisticated.

02:56.080 --> 02:59.200
And the coach will literally tell you what you did wrong.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.360
Every single moment the computer evaluated a mistake.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.080
But the most important thing that they have

03:05.080 --> 03:07.900
is they offer international masters, grand masters,

03:07.900 --> 03:10.000
the opportunity to make video lesson libraries,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.320
which hundreds of hours of anything.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.160
I can even learn some stuff on there probably.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.300
I have anal beads that are communicating

03:18.300 --> 03:19.920
with stockfish via Bluetooth.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.300
Yes, we will get to that.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.320
It's epic.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.280
It's actually scary how many people

03:25.280 --> 03:26.540
think that's a real thing by the way,

03:26.540 --> 03:27.960
which is the danger of the internet.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.760
But yeah, we will get into that.

03:29.760 --> 03:33.100
I tend to believe that people believing a thing

03:33.100 --> 03:37.920
that's hilarious at scale will make that thing a reality.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.500
I'm with Elon on this.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.720
I think people manifest the meme, the meme becomes real.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.840
So that, but that's in all walks of life.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.800
I think there is something about humor

03:48.800 --> 03:53.800
sort of being, why did I, I was going to say,

03:55.600 --> 03:58.280
is I feel like humor becomes a lubricant

03:58.280 --> 04:00.360
for the trajectory of human civilization.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.520
And I don't know why the word lubricant went into my head,

04:03.520 --> 04:07.400
which beads, I understand, but it's very Freudian.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.420
Anyway, so to zero to 900,

04:11.420 --> 04:13.580
if you're a 1300 player you were saying.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.060
If you're not good at end games,

04:15.060 --> 04:17.080
you don't understand how to convert positions

04:17.080 --> 04:20.500
that have seven or eight pieces left on the board.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.680
You don't know when you're supposed to activate your king.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.820
You don't know how a bishop outplays a knight

04:24.820 --> 04:26.280
with just several pawns on the board.

04:26.280 --> 04:27.680
Those are all very important things

04:27.680 --> 04:30.340
because it's not just about knowing

04:30.340 --> 04:31.300
the theoretical end games.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.000
Like some positions in chess are literally solved.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.880
If I showed you a position, I asked, what's the evaluation

04:35.880 --> 04:36.800
and how do you win it?

04:36.800 --> 04:39.120
There's a technique, you're supposed to know that technique.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.560
And the coaches on chess.com can help or no?

04:41.560 --> 04:43.140
Yeah, so these lesson libraries,

04:43.140 --> 04:44.200
it's not like a live lesson,

04:44.200 --> 04:48.360
it's pre-recorded training position, walk you through it.

04:48.360 --> 04:50.920
And then there's a dynamic factor as well

04:50.920 --> 04:52.320
where you can practice.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.600
You can practice the theoretical

04:53.600 --> 04:55.440
and you can practice a practical game

04:55.440 --> 04:58.320
where there's no set format to do something.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.800
It's just based on your previous experience.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.120
Basically, Lee Chess is their entire thing is

05:04.120 --> 05:07.560
it's an open source website that tries to be

05:07.560 --> 05:10.480
as free as possible and operates totally on donations.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.720
They don't have any advertisements, they don't have,

05:13.760 --> 05:15.400
which is weird because normally

05:15.400 --> 05:19.360
in big competitive settings, it's all capitalistic.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.560
You have one big entity and another big entity

05:22.560 --> 05:23.480
and they're both for profit.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.240
But in this case, the big argument is,

05:25.240 --> 05:27.340
well, they offer a lot of things for free.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.280
You can analyze your games for free.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.000
You can go into Lee Chess's lessons library

05:32.000 --> 05:33.600
and do things for free.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.600
The comparison that I always make is chess.com

05:36.600 --> 05:40.060
is basically like having a good personal trainer

05:40.060 --> 05:42.720
and having someone to help you at the gym.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.560
Lee Chess says you have to do all the stuff yourself.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.880
So you can combine YouTube with Lee Chess.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.540
No one's gonna really point you in the right direction.

05:49.540 --> 05:50.880
You gotta go fully explore on your own.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.300
If you want to do it, you can.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.000
I also like to say, can I make a controversial joke?

05:55.000 --> 05:55.840
Yes.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.840
Okay, ardent Lee Chess supporters are like very angry,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.920
only vegetarian or vegan folks

06:06.920 --> 06:09.880
because they will tear you apart

06:09.880 --> 06:12.400
and try to convert you as much as possible.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.600
Did you just point a large number of haters

06:16.600 --> 06:18.600
onto this very podcast?

06:18.600 --> 06:19.520
Is this what just happened?

06:19.520 --> 06:20.360
No.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.200
Is there like several people

06:21.200 --> 06:22.920
that were very upset at you right now?

06:22.920 --> 06:23.760
No.

06:23.760 --> 06:24.580
And throwing things?

06:24.580 --> 06:25.420
Okay. No, no.

06:25.420 --> 06:26.260
That's always the joke that I've made

06:26.260 --> 06:28.980
because if people have chess.com, and I love all people,

06:28.980 --> 06:32.940
but I'm just saying chess.com patrons

06:32.940 --> 06:36.740
do not try to actively convert folks on Lee Chess.

06:36.740 --> 06:39.360
Folks on Lee Chess are like, you know,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.060
there's a meme chess.com.

06:42.020 --> 06:43.060
Chess.com.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.660
And started at Lee Chess.

06:44.660 --> 06:48.380
Started somewhere on Reddit, Anarchy Chess, kind of a.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.740
Oh, so Lee Chess is a little bit

06:49.740 --> 06:51.820
of an anarchist organization.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.340
Would you go as far as to say

06:53.340 --> 06:56.520
they're a terrorist extremist organization?

06:57.480 --> 06:58.320
Are we going there?

06:58.320 --> 07:00.500
For legal reasons, that's a.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.700
I thought Lee Chess has like really good analysis.

07:03.700 --> 07:07.580
Somebody, does it have an engine for analysis of like games?

07:07.580 --> 07:09.700
Or is that an open source thing that like.

07:09.700 --> 07:10.540
They both do.

07:10.540 --> 07:12.060
They do Stockfish 15.

07:12.060 --> 07:12.900
Okay.

07:12.900 --> 07:16.180
And then the rest is the interface around Stockfish

07:16.180 --> 07:17.020
that shows.

07:17.020 --> 07:17.860
It's tough.

07:17.860 --> 07:18.860
It's the life.

07:18.860 --> 07:21.140
So chess has a live server where you and I can play a game

07:21.140 --> 07:21.980
against each other.

07:21.980 --> 07:22.940
We just both seek.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.580
And if we have the same rating, we have the same criteria.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.940
We'll play a game, but there's also reviewing your own games.

07:28.940 --> 07:31.020
There's an opening database so you can see

07:31.020 --> 07:32.900
what the most popular trends are.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.440
So Lee Chess is great.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.660
Like I'm sponsored by chess.com and I will openly say that,

07:37.660 --> 07:39.340
but you can't have.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.020
You're deeply biased.

07:41.020 --> 07:41.860
Yes.

07:41.860 --> 07:42.680
Okay.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.980
But I'm also complimenting the competitor, but.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.100
Can you play games on Lee Chess?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.940
Or is it just for analysis?

07:49.940 --> 07:50.780
Yeah, you can.

07:50.780 --> 07:51.620
Yeah.

07:51.620 --> 07:52.440
So it's the same exact thing.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.260
So they're like legitimately competitors.

07:54.260 --> 07:57.300
Not exactly the same thing, but they have the.

07:57.300 --> 07:59.660
They're trying to match for features,

07:59.660 --> 08:02.100
but you're saying Lee Chess is more chaotic

08:02.100 --> 08:05.580
and then chess.com is more like professional.

08:05.580 --> 08:06.500
Yeah, I don't know.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.540
I don't know if it's chaotic.

08:07.540 --> 08:10.940
I just know that it's, you have to,

08:10.940 --> 08:15.460
no one's gonna hold your hand if you go to Lee Chess.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.300
You absolutely can.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.140
You can play games.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.140
You can analyze your games,

08:18.140 --> 08:20.500
but you have to discover it yourself.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.740
The whole point of chess.com is to make the journey

08:22.740 --> 08:23.700
as simple as possible.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.540
Got it.

08:25.860 --> 08:28.260
But I also firmly believe you can't have any sort of growth

08:28.260 --> 08:31.700
in chess without a chess.com or a chess 24.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.300
What's chess 24?

08:33.300 --> 08:37.820
So chess 24 was another live server

08:37.820 --> 08:39.600
with some lesson libraries and so on,

08:39.600 --> 08:43.540
but they were, I think the process was

08:43.540 --> 08:45.100
they were bought by Play Magnus.

08:46.580 --> 08:47.700
What's Play Magnus?

08:47.700 --> 08:49.100
Play Magnus is.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.700
That's Magnus Carlson's thing.

08:51.700 --> 08:52.540
He doesn't own it.

08:52.540 --> 08:54.980
He owns some stake in it, I think nine or 10%.

08:54.980 --> 08:58.180
They owned a bunch of chess companies, including chess 24,

08:58.180 --> 09:00.140
but now it seems like they're either merging

09:00.140 --> 09:02.940
or basically getting acquired by chess.com.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.460
And then Play Magnus, it's an app also

09:05.460 --> 09:07.460
where you can play different levels,

09:07.460 --> 09:09.980
but there's also the educational stuff.

09:09.980 --> 09:10.800
Yes.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.640
Okay.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.980
The for-profit chess companies make the option

09:14.980 --> 09:18.460
for grandmasters to make a living to make chess in e-sport.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.300
Yeah, Lee Chess is great.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.700
It doesn't put on any events.

09:20.700 --> 09:21.580
There's no commentary.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.300
So you can have both in theory

09:23.300 --> 09:25.360
and probably some controversy is good.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.580
Does chess.com like sponsor you?

09:27.580 --> 09:29.540
They help you out in some way?

09:29.540 --> 09:31.320
Like what's the connection between your videos

09:31.320 --> 09:32.860
and streams and so on and chess.com?

09:33.700 --> 09:34.900
Like are they supporting people in that way or no?

09:34.900 --> 09:36.580
My content, they don't necessarily,

09:36.580 --> 09:37.860
I just make whatever I want.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.540
Like I don't have, I'm not sensible.

09:39.540 --> 09:40.540
If they do something stupid,

09:40.540 --> 09:42.420
I will call out their leadership.

09:42.420 --> 09:46.580
It's not like, but to have the logo up

09:46.580 --> 09:49.220
like in my YouTube videos or on my, yeah, that's just.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.040
That kind of stuff.

09:50.040 --> 09:50.880
Yeah.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.880
So anyway, back to, I mean, that was really helpful.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.380
I was confused about all of that.

09:54.380 --> 09:55.380
No, it's.

09:55.380 --> 09:59.260
The guessing people's rating.

09:59.260 --> 10:02.100
So the thing you mentioned about the end game,

10:02.100 --> 10:03.300
if you don't know what the hell you're doing

10:03.300 --> 10:05.560
with the end game, what does that mean about your rating?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.680
If you don't know how to finish

10:07.680 --> 10:09.860
with just a few pieces on the board.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.240
You could be my rating.

10:13.740 --> 10:14.700
End game is tough.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.440
That's the self-deprecating humor we tuned in for.

10:18.860 --> 10:19.980
End games are hard, man.

10:19.980 --> 10:20.820
They're tough.

10:20.820 --> 10:23.340
Yeah, you can't have, there's a reason

10:23.340 --> 10:26.780
Magnus is the best because seven hours into a game

10:26.780 --> 10:27.940
when everybody's given up,

10:27.940 --> 10:30.740
he's still squeezing juice out of the fruit.

10:30.780 --> 10:33.660
So that's the way I would describe it.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.820
So that's not a good source of information if you.

10:36.820 --> 10:40.700
No, within the first 15 moves, generally you can tell.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.200
Because you can tell how well they played the opening.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.860
So how well they knew what they were supposed to memorize,

10:46.860 --> 10:48.100
what they were supposed to play,

10:48.100 --> 10:51.460
and then how they react to peace interactions.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.180
So if they are faced with a move

10:55.180 --> 10:58.900
that a more advanced player would deal with very swiftly

10:58.900 --> 11:01.660
because there's kind of a natural response

11:01.660 --> 11:02.860
that gives you information.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.980
If they move their king when they're in check

11:04.980 --> 11:08.420
when they didn't have to, that's a massive giveaway.

11:08.420 --> 11:09.780
Some people just think, oh, I'm in check

11:09.780 --> 11:11.060
so I have to move my king.

11:11.060 --> 11:11.900
Oh, okay.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.180
So it's like how direct the response

11:15.180 --> 11:17.500
of your play is to the danger.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.260
So like if you're more moving

11:19.260 --> 11:21.500
like multiple pieces at a time,

11:21.500 --> 11:24.780
meaning like you're moving like the pieces

11:24.780 --> 11:27.980
are like tied together in interesting ways and then.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.620
Okay, okay.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.060
Like what about like, what about the opening

11:32.060 --> 11:33.660
can you tell also?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.300
Because a lot of people can memorize openings, right?

11:36.300 --> 11:40.820
Yeah, but takes two to tango.

11:40.820 --> 11:43.220
So you could memorize a bunch of stuff,

11:43.220 --> 11:45.060
but if you're 900 and I'm 900,

11:45.060 --> 11:46.660
your rating is fluctuating all over the place

11:46.660 --> 11:49.380
in this podcast, I feel like 12, 13, 900.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.780
You can memorize things, I'm gonna play some crap

11:51.780 --> 11:55.940
and you can't play the way you memorized

11:55.980 --> 11:58.780
because I have to respond to you in certain ways.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.500
So you will either respond the way you think

12:00.500 --> 12:01.620
you're supposed to respond

12:01.620 --> 12:03.980
and that will probably be incorrect.

12:03.980 --> 12:06.020
Or now you have to figure out how to deal

12:06.020 --> 12:08.020
with the fresh position.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.180
Also the 900 will reflect itself in both cases.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:13.620 --> 12:17.060
I wonder if actually, so do you know your current rating

12:17.060 --> 12:18.540
or no, or your top rating?

12:18.540 --> 12:19.500
What was your top?

12:19.500 --> 12:23.700
I know both my current ELO like over the board.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.660
Now it's 2320, my peak was 2430.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.500
Oh, cool.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.100
So can you play like a 900 player?

12:31.100 --> 12:34.340
Like, can you force yourself?

12:34.340 --> 12:35.180
Yeah.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.220
So you can like, given that you've guessed

12:37.220 --> 12:42.220
a lot of ELO ratings, can you kind of emulate that?

12:42.540 --> 12:43.940
It's kind of an interesting question.

12:43.940 --> 12:44.820
Yeah, yeah, of course.

12:44.820 --> 12:46.620
Before I was doing YouTube and Twitch,

12:46.620 --> 12:48.460
I was teaching kids.

12:48.460 --> 12:49.940
So I had to.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.540
Not only did I have to play at their rating,

12:51.540 --> 12:54.540
I also had to play and sometimes even behave

12:54.540 --> 12:57.220
and explain things in a way that a kid could understand.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.980
So absolutely, yeah.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.180
I think that's what contributed

13:00.180 --> 13:01.980
to the growth of the channel, frankly.

13:01.980 --> 13:04.540
I kind of understood how beginners thought about the game.

13:04.540 --> 13:07.460
So yeah, you taught people chess,

13:07.460 --> 13:10.660
you coach people for many years, I guess in New York.

13:10.660 --> 13:11.860
Yeah, New York, yeah.

13:11.860 --> 13:16.860
What did you learn about the way people learn from that?

13:17.020 --> 13:21.700
So like, how did people that were successful

13:21.700 --> 13:23.420
at getting good at chess quickly?

13:24.260 --> 13:26.540
What were some of the commonalities,

13:26.540 --> 13:28.860
some of the patterns that you saw?

13:28.860 --> 13:29.780
Obsession.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.100
Yeah.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.260
What does obsession look like?

13:34.260 --> 13:39.260
I would say it's obsession and also love of the game.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.620
So if you're bored, you don't want to watch a show,

13:42.620 --> 13:45.620
you want to boot up chess.com or Lee Chess,

13:46.580 --> 13:50.300
just so I don't get flamed by anyone in the audience.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.140
And you just play.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.340
So you're saying Lee Chess people

13:52.340 --> 13:54.140
are the ones that would attack aggressively?

13:54.140 --> 13:54.980
They're the kind of people.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.860
It's probably the Chess24 people.

13:56.860 --> 13:57.700
Oh, that's another.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.540
I didn't know.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.300
I thought Chess24 was part of the Chess.com.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.140
Well now, yes, that's the joke.

14:05.140 --> 14:07.980
Cult or tribe or whatever terms you want to use.

14:07.980 --> 14:09.980
I'm sure there's even more places to play live.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.940
There always have been more places to play live,

14:11.980 --> 14:13.820
but Chess.com, Lee Chess, Dominate,

14:13.820 --> 14:18.100
and well, Chess24 is rough for live interface.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.100
Of course they have good courses and everything, but.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.500
Lee Chess, I got it.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.340
I got it.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.940
And some are even good people or whatever.

14:26.940 --> 14:27.780
Yes.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.620
How does that quote go?

14:28.620 --> 14:29.460
Okay.

14:29.460 --> 14:31.700
Like obsession.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.260
That means the way they look at the board,

14:35.260 --> 14:37.180
when they're bored,

14:37.180 --> 14:40.100
how quickly do they return to the chess board?

14:40.100 --> 14:41.260
That kind of stuff.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.900
Just like how many hours a day they want to spend.

14:43.900 --> 14:44.740
Yes.

14:44.740 --> 14:45.580
They spend and want to spend.

14:45.580 --> 14:49.700
Some kids definitely have a talent.

14:49.700 --> 14:51.180
Of course, there's this eternal debate,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.620
talent versus hard work.

14:53.580 --> 14:55.500
I don't necessarily know if it's a talent

14:55.500 --> 14:57.780
for chess specifically,

14:57.780 --> 15:00.420
but it's a talent for,

15:00.420 --> 15:03.140
I'm sure there's some sort of spatial visualization

15:03.140 --> 15:03.980
in your mind.

15:03.980 --> 15:08.380
You start picking up what squares are controlled

15:08.380 --> 15:11.500
by your pieces and opponent's pieces faster.

15:11.500 --> 15:12.940
Your memory is much stronger.

15:12.940 --> 15:16.740
So you don't just learn openings like we discussed.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.900
You learn literal patterns such as,

15:19.900 --> 15:22.340
oh, I remember this from two tournaments ago.

15:22.340 --> 15:25.180
I remember this from a game I played just yesterday

15:25.180 --> 15:26.940
and you just keep playing and playing and playing.

15:26.940 --> 15:29.180
But I think the one commonality,

15:29.180 --> 15:31.780
I think I've seen in all kids,

15:31.780 --> 15:33.420
it's obsession.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.060
You have to play a lot.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.420
And I've seen kids who are brilliant kids,

15:38.420 --> 15:41.540
if you give them a page of tactics, puzzles,

15:41.540 --> 15:43.340
they solve faster than anybody.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.900
They can pick things up here super fast.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.460
They're a pleasure to teach.

15:46.460 --> 15:49.060
They go to a tournament, disaster.

15:49.060 --> 15:52.020
They can't handle the anxiousness.

15:52.020 --> 15:55.020
They can't handle that silent face-to-face war

15:55.020 --> 15:58.380
with another six-year-old.

15:58.380 --> 16:00.420
They can't even handle, there's also trash talk.

16:00.420 --> 16:04.420
One sentence by a kid can throw off your prize student.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.380
And I've seen kids just totally disintegrate.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.340
I've seen also my students bully other kids,

16:08.340 --> 16:11.060
corn, my student wasn't that strong.

16:11.060 --> 16:13.260
But their verbal warfare, which is not allowed,

16:13.260 --> 16:14.860
but goes unnoticed.

16:14.860 --> 16:17.220
It's not even verbal warfare.

16:17.220 --> 16:19.420
Like just going like, hmm.

16:19.420 --> 16:24.420
Like little facial expressions you make at the board.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.860
Yeah, I didn't even think about that.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.940
That's pretty creepy.

16:27.940 --> 16:30.460
The intensity, not creepy, that's not the right word,

16:30.460 --> 16:33.900
but there's an intensity in that silence over the board.

16:33.940 --> 16:35.780
Like you can probably hear stuff like,

16:35.780 --> 16:37.900
just like it's super quiet.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.700
It's like a library.

16:39.700 --> 16:44.420
And then there's just a tension that builds.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.300
You can hear the breathing.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.700
Yeah, and at the highest level,

16:48.700 --> 16:51.340
both sides are involved in a battle

16:51.340 --> 16:53.860
that they both foresee 99% of the time.

16:53.860 --> 16:55.500
That's the scary part is that

16:55.500 --> 16:57.540
you both see the exact same thing.

16:57.540 --> 17:00.180
It's very rare you play a move that I didn't see it.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.260
It's that I mis-evaluated it.

17:02.260 --> 17:04.220
I saw the move could be played,

17:04.220 --> 17:06.420
but I missed something three or four moves deeper.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.500
You play that move and suddenly you're excited

17:08.500 --> 17:09.820
and I'm nervous.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.620
But all of a sudden you make an inaccuracy

17:12.620 --> 17:13.940
and now the tide shifts, right?

17:13.940 --> 17:16.780
We could be on totally different planes throughout the game

17:16.780 --> 17:18.300
or we could be on the same plane throughout the game.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.140
So it's really fascinating.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.900
Yeah, so your thought is when you see a move

17:22.900 --> 17:25.700
that to you seems suboptimal and you start to think,

17:26.740 --> 17:28.340
what was that?

17:28.340 --> 17:29.740
You start to try to make sense of that.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.500
Did you miscalculate or did they miscalculate?

17:34.180 --> 17:36.300
Isn't that what Magnus is really good at

17:36.300 --> 17:40.660
is taking people away from making suboptimal moves

17:40.660 --> 17:45.660
to take them away from the known openings

17:45.820 --> 17:47.300
or is that unfair to say?

17:47.300 --> 17:52.300
Yeah, he gets part of his really dominant reputation,

17:53.220 --> 17:57.460
I think, from not letting people get into

17:57.460 --> 18:00.780
ultra theoretical positions.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.540
He just won this tournament, this online tournament,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.660
and he said he had a young player strategy.

18:06.660 --> 18:09.940
He had an anti, sorry, a anti young player strategy.

18:09.940 --> 18:10.780
What's that mean?

18:10.780 --> 18:12.900
It means that by move seven or eight,

18:12.900 --> 18:15.380
you go to the database, no games.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.220
Kid is on their own, they have to swim on their own.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.820
And they have to deal with the strategic complexities

18:20.820 --> 18:23.500
of the position, which he just, he gets.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.940
And he might get from just an enormous database

18:26.940 --> 18:28.820
within his brain of historical games

18:28.820 --> 18:33.340
that have similar structures or just sheer genius.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.860
We won't know.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.540
It's a mix of the two, for sure.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.500
The younger you are, you can't remember a game played

18:38.500 --> 18:41.860
in 1951 and some bar in the Soviet Union,

18:41.860 --> 18:44.580
but he does, because he read a book once

18:44.580 --> 18:45.660
or a magazine once.

18:45.660 --> 18:46.500
And he just remembers.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.020
He just remembers, he remembers the structure,

18:48.020 --> 18:50.900
which it's just, it's not fair.

18:50.900 --> 18:51.740
It's crazy, right?

18:51.740 --> 18:53.940
What do you think makes him, if we can sort of linger on it,

18:53.940 --> 18:55.740
what do you think makes him so good?

18:55.740 --> 18:58.340
I think it's the memory and I think it's,

19:01.100 --> 19:06.100
he just seems to get the game better than anybody else.

19:06.340 --> 19:08.380
That's the best way I can describe it.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.380
In sports, you have reaction time, you have strength,

19:10.380 --> 19:15.380
you have, but also as he's now evolving, it's stamina.

19:16.820 --> 19:20.180
So there have been games that if you put two other

19:20.180 --> 19:23.860
2750 rated players or world top 10 players,

19:23.860 --> 19:25.180
they would have drawn the game.

19:25.180 --> 19:26.340
The game would have ended, the game,

19:26.340 --> 19:28.220
nobody would have won it.

19:28.220 --> 19:31.660
You put Magnus as one of the aggressors in that game,

19:31.660 --> 19:35.620
suddenly the chance of victory doubles from 5% to 10%.

19:35.620 --> 19:36.460
That's weird.

19:36.460 --> 19:37.300
What's that about?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.580
Because what is it, game six against NEPA?

19:39.580 --> 19:40.700
Right.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.540
Isn't Stockfish say that it's supposed to be a draw?

19:43.540 --> 19:47.660
So 0.00 does mean a draw sometimes,

19:47.660 --> 19:50.140
but other times it means, and it's the joke I always make,

19:50.140 --> 19:52.500
it means that Stockfish is out for a smoke break.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.340
It just, it can't.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.940
Can you explain the joke and can you explain 0.00?

19:55.940 --> 20:00.700
Yes, so when, so Stockfish will show an evaluation

20:00.700 --> 20:03.580
which determines whether the position is equal,

20:03.580 --> 20:05.500
slightly better for one side, slightly better

20:05.500 --> 20:08.060
for the other side, or completely winning.

20:08.060 --> 20:13.060
You can, 0.00, 0.2 minus 0.2, that's all within a balance.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.940
You can say, okay, black has a little sprinkle of activity,

20:16.940 --> 20:19.300
something, white has that.

20:19.300 --> 20:23.500
But if it's 0.00, it could be literally a dead draw,

20:23.500 --> 20:26.380
meaning theoretically, just impossible to win.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.340
But oftentimes what that means is,

20:28.340 --> 20:31.740
the smoke break joke is, Stockfish doesn't know.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.300
There is so much complexity within the position,

20:34.300 --> 20:37.020
the combinations of different moves that are acceptable

20:37.020 --> 20:40.140
and okay, it cannot evaluate correctly.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.980
Wow, so even the end games are tough for Stockfish.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.820
Which is why Magnus won that game

20:46.820 --> 20:49.420
because there was practical value remaining.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.740
It wasn't a dead draw.

20:50.740 --> 20:53.060
He continued to ask questions

20:53.060 --> 20:55.060
over the course of six or seven hours.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.660
He would sacrifice a pawn.

20:56.660 --> 20:58.980
He would sacrifice another pawn to damage the structure.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.980
Valuation stayed the same

21:00.980 --> 21:05.460
because a machine could stop him, but not Yan.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.380
And that was one of my favorite,

21:07.380 --> 21:09.380
that game ruined my whole day, by the way.

21:09.380 --> 21:12.660
It destroyed, because I made so many plans that day,

21:12.660 --> 21:13.740
it completely ruined my day,

21:13.740 --> 21:15.660
but it was a very worthy recap.

21:15.660 --> 21:18.380
You were just all in, you watched that whole game?

21:18.380 --> 21:19.220
I watched the whole game

21:19.220 --> 21:21.420
and the World Championship was a crazy time

21:21.420 --> 21:25.180
because I wanted to be first with the recap video,

21:25.180 --> 21:27.820
but I also wanted to be best with the recap video.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.580
So I spent all the hours of the games

21:29.580 --> 21:32.100
watching all the live broadcasts

21:32.100 --> 21:34.940
and getting all the information, all the variations,

21:34.940 --> 21:36.540
and trying to put that into the recap.

21:36.540 --> 21:37.380
It was a lot of fun.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.700
It was a huge adrenaline dump when it was all over.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.300
So just for people who don't know,

21:41.300 --> 21:43.460
that's the most recent World Championship.

21:44.420 --> 21:48.060
So you had a, I mean, that was a draw after draw

21:48.060 --> 21:49.620
after draw after draw.

21:49.620 --> 21:50.460
Yeah.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.340
And it was kind of boring in that way.

21:52.340 --> 21:57.060
Or maybe our draws, is there like non-boring parts

21:57.060 --> 21:58.860
within the draw to you

21:58.860 --> 22:01.100
when you were like just studying it carefully?

22:01.100 --> 22:02.620
For me, yes.

22:03.540 --> 22:05.580
For the average viewer, no.

22:05.580 --> 22:06.420
That's the truth.

22:06.420 --> 22:09.780
Especially when the game itself is not that exciting.

22:09.780 --> 22:13.980
When Magnus plays a strange move on move nine or 10

22:13.980 --> 22:16.060
that hasn't ever been played,

22:16.060 --> 22:18.740
and then Jan has to try to exploit it,

22:18.740 --> 22:21.220
and he fails, and no attack builds up,

22:21.220 --> 22:23.500
and they shuffle their pieces for three hours.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.220
My favorite thing is when the commentator's like,

22:25.220 --> 22:26.540
I don't know why he did that.

22:26.540 --> 22:27.820
I wonder why he did that.

22:27.820 --> 22:28.660
Yeah.

22:28.660 --> 22:29.740
When the commentators are confused,

22:29.740 --> 22:32.380
that's my, as a person who's just a spectator,

22:32.380 --> 22:34.940
just like, that's interesting.

22:34.940 --> 22:36.860
Because then you, the most interesting part

22:36.860 --> 22:38.820
is about listening to the commentators

22:38.820 --> 22:42.100
who I guess themselves might be grandmasters.

22:42.100 --> 22:43.060
All, yeah.

22:43.060 --> 22:46.580
They are trying to, I guess just like Nepo,

22:46.580 --> 22:49.300
just like Magnus tried to figure out,

22:49.300 --> 22:50.780
what's the idea here?

22:50.780 --> 22:52.140
What are you thinking?

22:52.140 --> 22:52.980
That's cool.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.500
That's an interesting part of the game.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.060
But other than that, it seemed,

22:59.300 --> 23:03.100
yeah, I was sure this was just gonna keep being a draw,

23:03.100 --> 23:04.660
especially in that situation.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.220
So it's almost, it seems almost remarkable

23:07.220 --> 23:12.220
that Magnus was able to put, pull out a win in game six.

23:13.260 --> 23:17.580
And after that, at least Magnus said that that ends it,

23:17.580 --> 23:20.260
because now Nepo's gonna have to take more risks,

23:20.260 --> 23:22.260
and that opens it up to pure chess.

23:22.260 --> 23:26.300
And then it's, who was it?

23:26.300 --> 23:28.860
Steve Prefontaine said like whenever it's,

23:28.860 --> 23:31.420
whenever the race is down to like pure guts,

23:31.420 --> 23:33.780
then that's when I win it.

23:33.780 --> 23:38.700
There was also a conversation about Jan's first half,

23:38.700 --> 23:41.140
second half in any tournament.

23:41.140 --> 23:43.540
In the first half, he's just brilliant on fire.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.660
You could even say he was out playing Magnus,

23:45.660 --> 23:47.980
but the entire conversation before the match was,

23:47.980 --> 23:49.180
Jan slows down.

23:49.180 --> 23:52.220
And at the first sign of a loss or a setback,

23:53.140 --> 23:54.620
the match might fall apart.

23:54.620 --> 23:57.180
And that was the worst way to lose.

23:57.180 --> 23:58.700
There was literally no worse way.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.220
And it just got worse from there and there.

24:00.220 --> 24:02.020
I mean, it was one move mistakes and,

24:03.020 --> 24:04.500
but he's back.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.660
He's gonna, Jan has won the candidates again.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.420
He's gonna play for the world championship, so.

24:08.420 --> 24:09.660
Who you got?

24:09.660 --> 24:10.500
Who you got?

24:10.500 --> 24:13.100
What is this slang terminology?

24:14.980 --> 24:18.060
Can we like somehow edit that into a more sophisticated

24:18.060 --> 24:20.300
with a British accent type of phraseology?

24:20.300 --> 24:23.540
Okay, who do you think will win that match?

24:24.380 --> 24:27.820
I think it's 55-45, but I don't know for sure.

24:27.820 --> 24:28.660
I don't know.

24:28.660 --> 24:29.700
That's not the-

24:29.700 --> 24:30.540
So it's close.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.380
It's very close.

24:31.380 --> 24:32.220
Okay.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.060
You can make both cases.

24:33.060 --> 24:34.060
You could say Ding,

24:34.060 --> 24:36.140
you could say Jan has been here before.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.340
You can say to the world championship stage,

24:38.340 --> 24:40.820
he knows what it's like to have a training camp

24:40.820 --> 24:41.780
and so on and so forth.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.060
His playing style is very,

24:43.060 --> 24:47.340
but you can also say Ding Liran is one of the most stable,

24:48.780 --> 24:50.700
unemotional chess players.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.820
And Ding oftentimes goes from down to up.

24:53.820 --> 24:54.640
So in the candidates,

24:54.640 --> 24:57.740
he lost to Jan in the very first game.

24:57.740 --> 25:00.780
14 round tournament, he got demolished in the first game.

25:00.780 --> 25:03.300
I'm sure he was suffering from jet lag, the flight.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.860
He came to Spain like two days before the games began,

25:05.860 --> 25:07.420
which was crazy to me.

25:07.420 --> 25:10.220
And he got second place by the end.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.660
His chances of finishing in the top two were like 2%.

25:14.660 --> 25:17.780
After that first round game, people wrote him off completely.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.700
So he doesn't go from top down.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.380
He goes the opposite way.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.460
And if he loses, he might come back.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.740
But the truth is, I don't know.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.860
The truth is it's gonna be an interesting match.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.860
And it's also disappointing.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.100
We're not gonna get Magnus in it.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.700
Yeah, what do you think about him stepping away

25:30.700 --> 25:32.340
from the world championship?

25:32.340 --> 25:34.660
Are you a romantic about the world championships?

25:34.660 --> 25:37.660
No, I'm not a romantic about anything, I don't think.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.500
I can't imagine.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.860
It's dark.

25:39.860 --> 25:41.100
That went dark quickly.

25:41.100 --> 25:43.220
I don't think I'm sophisticated enough to be a romantic.

25:43.220 --> 25:46.500
I think I, you know, I taught chess

25:46.500 --> 25:47.900
and now I make YouTube videos.

25:47.900 --> 25:52.180
I'm not qualified on the subject of romanticism, but I...

25:52.180 --> 25:53.900
You don't think it's a beautiful game?

25:53.900 --> 25:54.740
Chess?

25:54.740 --> 25:56.060
No, I think it is a beautiful game.

25:56.060 --> 25:57.020
There you go, I got you.

25:57.060 --> 25:59.540
Yeah, is that considered being a romantic?

25:59.540 --> 26:02.620
Yeah, I was seeing the beauty in the...

26:02.620 --> 26:06.340
You can be like Bach and seeing the math in the music

26:06.340 --> 26:08.740
or you can see the beauty, the magic.

26:08.740 --> 26:10.820
I think I see beauty in certain types of chess for sure.

26:10.820 --> 26:11.780
Not in all chess.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.740
So I'll partially romantic.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.740
Part-time romantic.

26:16.740 --> 26:19.860
Yeah, so what, I mean, what do you feel

26:19.860 --> 26:24.140
about Magnus stepping away from the world championships?

26:24.140 --> 26:26.140
Disappointing, but understandable.

26:26.140 --> 26:28.020
Can you still man his case?

26:28.020 --> 26:30.940
What's understandable about it to you?

26:32.260 --> 26:35.580
I don't think it's as prestigious as it could be.

26:35.580 --> 26:36.780
I don't think...

26:36.780 --> 26:37.620
The world championship?

26:37.620 --> 26:38.460
Yeah, yeah.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.340
Why does Magnus still sign everything

26:40.340 --> 26:41.940
as world champion then?

26:41.940 --> 26:44.660
That's a good point that he did just put out a statement

26:44.660 --> 26:45.500
and he did say it.

26:45.500 --> 26:46.660
But he does it everywhere else too.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.500
Does he really?

26:47.500 --> 26:48.940
Yeah, like world champion, right?

26:48.940 --> 26:49.780
World champion.

26:49.780 --> 26:50.620
I don't know.

26:50.620 --> 26:51.900
World champion, world chess champion.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.980
Maybe it's just because he wanted,

26:54.980 --> 26:59.980
but he thinks that the journey to the top once again,

27:00.060 --> 27:04.140
to maintain the status quo has lost its appeal.

27:04.140 --> 27:06.460
You know what the example that I like to make?

27:06.460 --> 27:09.860
I'm a big fan of UFC.

27:09.860 --> 27:13.060
So we've never really seen,

27:13.060 --> 27:15.980
with the exception of Georges Saint-Pierre walking

27:15.980 --> 27:18.820
and Khabib, but Khabib was kind of a different story,

27:18.820 --> 27:23.820
walking away from a belt at the absolute zenith

27:25.020 --> 27:26.860
of their career.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.380
But also in the UFC,

27:28.380 --> 27:31.460
champions are extremely well taken care of.

27:31.460 --> 27:34.300
I mean, champions have some of the best lives.

27:34.300 --> 27:35.740
Of course, you can argue not all champions.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.500
You can say some of the lower weight divisions, yes.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.540
But what I'm saying is a lot of them get all the sponsors.

27:40.540 --> 27:42.380
They get massive, massive paydays.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.100
They're international celebrities.

27:44.100 --> 27:45.620
I don't think chess has that.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.180
In fact, the world championship of chess prize fund

27:48.180 --> 27:51.700
has not changed much in like 40 years.

27:51.700 --> 27:55.900
So you could probably make more money on YouTube.

27:55.900 --> 27:56.740
Yes.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.780
Playing randos, not randos, but other,

27:59.780 --> 28:02.380
having fun and playing challenging,

28:02.380 --> 28:03.340
really challenging games,

28:03.340 --> 28:05.340
playing other Super Grand Masters,

28:05.340 --> 28:07.100
like an ad hoc events,

28:08.300 --> 28:09.780
or maybe a little bit of organized events,

28:09.780 --> 28:11.340
but not the world championship.

28:11.340 --> 28:12.180
Yeah.

28:12.180 --> 28:14.940
And still have a lot of fun, make a lot of money,

28:16.060 --> 28:17.940
get everybody excited, all that kind of stuff.

28:17.940 --> 28:20.980
Yeah, so for Magnus specifically,

28:21.860 --> 28:23.580
we're using him because he's the world champion.

28:23.580 --> 28:25.900
If you tally, if he wins every tournament

28:25.900 --> 28:27.220
that he plays in over the course of a year,

28:27.220 --> 28:29.860
which is really not even that crazy of an estimate,

28:29.860 --> 28:31.860
because that's really how it seems sometimes,

28:31.860 --> 28:32.860
I don't know how much money that is.

28:32.860 --> 28:36.460
I haven't tallied, but if he dedicated an entire year

28:36.460 --> 28:40.500
to being managed on social media and doing various things

28:40.500 --> 28:42.980
and growing all his brands and getting sponsor deals,

28:42.980 --> 28:44.020
I think he would make five times more

28:44.020 --> 28:46.940
than being the world champion, which is crazy.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.340
Yeah, but money isn't everything.

28:48.340 --> 28:49.900
I know, that's totally fair.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.540
I think people dedicate their whole life

28:51.540 --> 28:52.940
to winning the Olympics.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.140
The Olympics is a funny, is an interesting one too,

28:55.140 --> 28:59.940
because I didn't even watch the Olympics

28:59.940 --> 29:01.540
as carefully as I usually do.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.260
This year, yeah, me neither.

29:03.260 --> 29:06.020
It's really strange, I'm not sure why that is.

29:06.020 --> 29:09.980
And during COVID, I'm not sure, that was weird.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.020
I don't know if it's losing its magic.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.140
Part of it is also the people that own the Olympics

29:15.140 --> 29:16.660
and the way they distribute it,

29:16.660 --> 29:19.300
they make it a little bit more difficult to watch.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.820
In my opinion, it should all be just available on YouTube

29:22.820 --> 29:25.340
and easily accessible.

29:25.340 --> 29:28.900
It's like the difference between SpaceX

29:28.900 --> 29:32.660
and some other, like even NASA.

29:32.660 --> 29:36.220
Just SpaceX is better at streaming their launches

29:36.220 --> 29:38.100
and commentating them.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.460
They've made NASA better as well,

29:40.460 --> 29:43.100
but just like the ability, it sounds ridiculous,

29:43.100 --> 29:47.860
but making it more frictionless for people to watch,

29:47.900 --> 29:50.940
get excited, to share, all that kind of stuff.

29:50.940 --> 29:55.940
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure where the magic balance is

29:57.180 --> 30:00.660
between the classy, traditional world championships

30:00.660 --> 30:05.660
and the kind of dramatic, exciting streamer world.

30:06.260 --> 30:09.060
And it feels like for the world championships

30:09.060 --> 30:12.100
to be relevant, they have to find that balance.

30:12.100 --> 30:15.500
Yeah, well this recent one had, I was-

30:15.500 --> 30:17.060
It's pretty good commentating, yeah.

30:17.060 --> 30:19.820
No, I'm not even necessarily talking about myself.

30:19.820 --> 30:20.660
There was a lot of-

30:20.660 --> 30:22.260
No, that was the worst part for me.

30:22.260 --> 30:26.340
No, you did amazing, yeah.

30:26.340 --> 30:27.180
I appreciate that.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.820
It was a lot of, it was a big arms race.

30:29.820 --> 30:34.820
So every major chess platform tried to get

30:34.860 --> 30:37.140
one super grand master.

30:37.140 --> 30:40.380
Vishwanathan, Anand, Fabiano Caruana, you name it.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.060
They were basically involved.

30:43.060 --> 30:45.100
And to go back to that point,

30:45.900 --> 30:47.100
the big question is money.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.980
And if Magnus is not motivated by money,

30:49.980 --> 30:51.580
if the prize fund for the next world championship

30:51.580 --> 30:53.300
was $10 million, would he play it?

30:53.300 --> 30:56.340
If he says no, then it must be something else.

30:56.340 --> 30:59.580
It must just be a matter of something's not worth it.

30:59.580 --> 31:00.420
It's not worth it.

31:00.420 --> 31:01.240
You gotta take him in his word.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.980
And his word is like, there's too much stress

31:04.980 --> 31:07.860
to the low sample play.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.780
Like I wanna play many more times.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.820
Yeah, he wants to play more.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.340
He wants to make it more interesting.

31:12.340 --> 31:13.700
Yeah, exactly.

31:13.700 --> 31:15.620
Yeah, more shorter games,

31:15.620 --> 31:19.580
like where you can increase the possibility of pure chess.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.420
Whatever the heck that means.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.140
Yeah, but we can't go back to the first

31:23.140 --> 31:24.340
Karpov Kasparov match,

31:24.340 --> 31:26.940
which they had to stop due to health concerns.

31:26.940 --> 31:28.700
I mean, the guy went down five nil,

31:28.700 --> 31:30.660
and it was first to six wins.

31:30.660 --> 31:31.780
And draws didn't count.

31:31.780 --> 31:33.820
So draws didn't amass to the total score.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.900
There was no best of system.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.340
So what happened there?

31:37.340 --> 31:39.420
The match went something like seven, eight months.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.980
Kasparov started making a comeback

31:40.980 --> 31:42.220
after being down five nothing.

31:42.220 --> 31:45.060
He was five, three, and they called it off.

31:45.060 --> 31:45.900
They called it off.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.340
They said both players are in poor health conditions

31:47.340 --> 31:50.820
because Kasparov stormed down, yelled that this is a farce.

31:50.820 --> 31:54.980
But the match was 50 games long, even more maybe.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.260
I made a video and I don't even remember

31:56.260 --> 31:57.100
how many games it was.

31:57.100 --> 31:58.700
It was so long.

31:58.700 --> 31:59.540
Can you imagine?

31:59.540 --> 32:02.660
Bobby Fischer wanted something almost as extreme.

32:02.660 --> 32:03.540
Draws don't count.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.340
It's first one to 10 wins.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.500
And if it's nine, nine,

32:07.500 --> 32:09.780
the world champion retains his title.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.660
So you have to beat the world champion 10, eight.

32:12.660 --> 32:13.740
That's the only way.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.620
So you don't like that?

32:15.620 --> 32:16.580
What?

32:16.580 --> 32:17.420
It's just grueling?

32:17.420 --> 32:18.260
I don't know.

32:18.260 --> 32:19.500
Maybe I like it for the YouTube recaps,

32:19.500 --> 32:21.180
but do I like it for the players?

32:21.180 --> 32:22.300
Do I like it for general public?

32:22.300 --> 32:23.140
No.

32:23.140 --> 32:24.300
It's three, four hours, right?

32:24.300 --> 32:27.300
You imagine your favorite tennis match was six months long.

32:29.180 --> 32:30.020
What are we doing?

32:30.020 --> 32:31.060
Yeah, yeah.

32:31.060 --> 32:33.020
There's still magic to the world championship.

32:33.020 --> 32:35.220
I wish they could make it some interesting,

32:36.820 --> 32:38.860
make it work somehow.

32:38.860 --> 32:42.260
But I think Magnus is really challenging Fide

32:42.260 --> 32:44.780
and everybody else to step up and try to figure that out,

32:44.780 --> 32:46.140
which is great, ultimately.

32:47.820 --> 32:50.660
Who would you say is the greatest of all time?

32:50.660 --> 32:52.380
Can you make the case?

32:52.380 --> 32:53.340
You mentioned Kasparov.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.620
Can you make the case for Kasparov?

32:54.620 --> 32:57.300
Can you make the case for Magnus Carlsen?

32:57.300 --> 32:58.500
Bobby Fischer?

32:59.660 --> 33:00.500
Tall?

33:02.660 --> 33:04.540
In my opinion, you can make a case

33:04.540 --> 33:07.340
for Magnus, Gary, and Bobby Fischer.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.260
I'm not one of the folks that's like,

33:09.260 --> 33:11.220
I mean, Capa Blanca was brilliant.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.060
You can argue Steinitz was brilliant,

33:13.060 --> 33:18.060
but I think it's probably Kasparov

33:19.260 --> 33:21.420
and Magnus has a chance to overtake it.

33:22.260 --> 33:24.580
So the longevity is really important to you

33:24.580 --> 33:25.660
when you were thinking about this.

33:25.660 --> 33:26.820
Yes, I think so.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.380
I think Magnus is very, very close.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.060
It's extremely close.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.900
What would be the magic?

33:32.900 --> 33:34.860
You gotta get that sixth one.

33:34.860 --> 33:35.700
Oh, so the-

33:35.700 --> 33:36.940
No, I'm just kidding.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.260
So the world championships matter.

33:39.260 --> 33:40.500
It's kind of like basketball, right?

33:40.500 --> 33:42.780
Rings, it all comes down to how many rings

33:42.780 --> 33:44.140
did this person win?

33:44.140 --> 33:46.060
What about, well, basketball doesn't have this.

33:46.060 --> 33:49.820
The number of years at number one, right?

33:49.820 --> 33:51.780
Like, rating, sorry.

33:51.780 --> 33:52.620
Yeah.

33:53.460 --> 33:58.180
Like, there is a, which is what Magnus really likes,

33:58.180 --> 34:00.860
is like, there is a nice system of rating

34:00.860 --> 34:02.580
of who is ranked number one,

34:02.580 --> 34:05.300
and it has to do not with some championships

34:05.460 --> 34:07.500
or low-sampled tournaments.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.500
It has to do with general.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.900
Game after game after game helps estimate

34:12.900 --> 34:15.180
more accurately the ELO rating, so.

34:15.180 --> 34:17.860
Yeah, he's been world number one for, I think, 11 years.

34:17.860 --> 34:18.700
Right?

34:18.700 --> 34:19.540
Which is still less than-

34:19.540 --> 34:21.980
Gary was world number one for 20 years.

34:21.980 --> 34:24.220
Yeah, which is quite wild.

34:24.220 --> 34:27.420
But still lower rating, I think, than Magnus now, right?

34:27.420 --> 34:30.060
Yeah, I think rating in general has sort of-

34:30.060 --> 34:31.780
Allegedly, it got inflated?

34:31.780 --> 34:32.620
Yeah.

34:32.620 --> 34:33.460
Is that true?

34:33.460 --> 34:34.300
Is there truth to that?

34:34.300 --> 34:35.140
I think so.

34:35.140 --> 34:37.420
I don't, I can't speak to how exactly it happened,

34:37.420 --> 34:38.900
but it also happens online.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.700
If you go back just three or four years,

34:40.700 --> 34:42.220
I think some of the best Blitz players

34:42.220 --> 34:45.460
on, let's say, shows.com were 27, 2800,

34:45.460 --> 34:47.660
and now they're 3200.

34:47.660 --> 34:48.940
I think it's just sort of what happens,

34:48.940 --> 34:52.100
but I don't exactly know.

34:52.100 --> 34:56.060
I will mention that there was a very strange change,

34:56.060 --> 34:58.140
not exactly sure when the year was,

34:58.140 --> 35:00.260
in FIDE, so over the board chess,

35:00.260 --> 35:05.260
where if you were under the age of 16 or 18 years old,

35:05.420 --> 35:10.420
one of those two, and you were below 2300, okay,

35:11.260 --> 35:15.460
your rating change factor was three to four times higher.

35:16.460 --> 35:17.660
So just imagine what that means.

35:17.660 --> 35:21.020
Magnus has a rating change factor of, let's say, one.

35:22.140 --> 35:23.820
I have a rating change factor also of one.

35:23.820 --> 35:26.740
Anybody over the rating 2400

35:26.740 --> 35:28.820
has the same rating change factor.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.780
What is the rating change factor?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.620
So if you win.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.820
Yeah, there's a formula, and basically,

35:33.820 --> 35:36.940
let's say at the very base level, five-point change.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.900
If your rating change factor is one.

35:38.900 --> 35:42.140
You beat somebody, you gain five points.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.460
Those kids who were under 18 and under 2300,

35:45.460 --> 35:47.340
their rating change factor was four.

35:47.340 --> 35:49.980
So their ratings were going out four times higher

35:49.980 --> 35:52.980
and four times up and down compared to normal folks.

35:52.980 --> 35:57.340
And there was one teenager in the US in particular

35:57.380 --> 36:01.540
who in one month played a bunch of tournaments

36:01.540 --> 36:03.940
with his rating change factor

36:03.940 --> 36:07.820
and became nearly rated 2640,

36:07.820 --> 36:10.860
which is top 50 in the world.

36:10.860 --> 36:13.740
He was just a random teenager from the United States.

36:13.740 --> 36:15.660
He became a grandmaster ultimately,

36:15.660 --> 36:18.460
but he bled like 90 points down

36:18.460 --> 36:20.780
because his rating was so inflated.

36:20.780 --> 36:23.500
And the K40 exists now.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.220
I mean, you have many kids who out of nowhere,

36:25.260 --> 36:29.700
2,100, 2,100, 2,400 after one good month.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.100
It's like, what?

36:31.100 --> 36:31.940
So-

36:31.940 --> 36:32.780
That's interesting.

36:32.780 --> 36:37.460
That's similar to how TikTok inflates your virality

36:37.460 --> 36:38.540
early on.

36:38.540 --> 36:39.620
Does it?

36:39.620 --> 36:44.260
Well, yeah, at least the rumor is like,

36:44.260 --> 36:45.900
they want you to get engaged.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.660
And I thought there was even artificial likes and so on

36:48.660 --> 36:51.940
that they want you to get that dopamine addiction.

36:51.980 --> 36:55.500
So maybe they want to throw you,

36:55.500 --> 36:56.980
if you're really passionate about chess,

36:56.980 --> 36:59.060
they want you to throw you to the sharks

36:59.060 --> 37:01.780
by artificially inflating you,

37:01.780 --> 37:03.460
inflating your rating.

37:03.460 --> 37:06.900
And maybe that gets you into the game much more intensely.

37:06.900 --> 37:07.740
Maybe.

37:09.380 --> 37:12.100
I wonder how many like backdoor feed-in meetings

37:12.100 --> 37:13.940
there are with cigars.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.420
So that was the factors determined by,

37:16.420 --> 37:18.860
who does the ELO rating?

37:18.860 --> 37:19.860
Who changes this stuff?

37:19.860 --> 37:20.700
Yeah.

37:21.700 --> 37:22.900
Who knows?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.900
It's probably those Lee chess anarchists.

37:24.900 --> 37:25.940
Yeah, exactly.

37:25.940 --> 37:30.660
I think they want to stay away from that stuff, but-

37:30.660 --> 37:34.140
So there's a guy named Hans Nieman.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.500
Yep.

37:35.500 --> 37:40.500
And he beat Magnus Carlsen recently.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.340
Yeah.

37:41.340 --> 37:43.700
Has been already, what was it, August?

37:43.700 --> 37:44.540
September 4th.

37:44.540 --> 37:45.900
Oh, it was September?

37:46.940 --> 37:49.500
So he beat him twice, right, recently.

37:49.620 --> 37:54.620
Once is the allegations by the internet

37:55.100 --> 37:57.140
that Hans Nieman cheated.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.420
And then the second time,

37:59.420 --> 38:04.420
Magnus played a few moves and forfeited and resigned.

38:04.860 --> 38:06.180
There's actually, so there's three.

38:06.180 --> 38:07.180
Okay, sorry, can you-

38:07.180 --> 38:08.020
No, no, yeah.

38:08.020 --> 38:08.860
Can we go through the stocks?

38:08.860 --> 38:10.220
Yes, yes, yes.

38:10.220 --> 38:15.220
So they play a live e-sports event in Miami.

38:15.540 --> 38:16.580
Miami Beach.

38:16.580 --> 38:17.420
Yes.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.260
Eden Rock.

38:18.260 --> 38:20.540
That's where I actually interviewed Magnus.

38:20.540 --> 38:21.380
Yeah.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.020
That's where that was?

38:23.020 --> 38:23.860
Oh.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.180
By weird circumstance, I found myself in Miami

38:26.180 --> 38:28.260
unrelated to the chess event.

38:28.260 --> 38:31.140
And yeah, it was a very dramatic event for me

38:31.140 --> 38:34.900
for various reasons, one of which the camera

38:34.900 --> 38:36.780
stopped working halfway through the conversation.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.140
I saw that, yeah, I saw that.

38:38.140 --> 38:43.140
I also, side note, I really respect how you write comments,

38:44.140 --> 38:46.860
pin them at the top, you add timestamps,

38:46.860 --> 38:49.180
you're like very true professional.

38:49.180 --> 38:51.020
I am the complete opposite on YouTube

38:51.020 --> 38:52.460
when I'm off the camera.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.620
So I dig in the mud.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.580
What does that mean, dig in the mud?

38:56.580 --> 39:00.100
From when I started on YouTube in 2020,

39:01.580 --> 39:05.020
in June, like May, June 2020, I had no subscribers.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.940
So I got to a million in a year.

39:06.940 --> 39:11.340
I had a lot of people analyzing my every move,

39:11.340 --> 39:16.340
all of my small flaws, and I love getting hate comments.

39:17.100 --> 39:17.940
Because-

39:17.940 --> 39:21.420
Yeah, you pin, is it the comment of shame or something?

39:21.420 --> 39:24.100
That's what it's been named over the years by folks.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.820
I never called it that, but yeah, it's pin of shame.

39:26.820 --> 39:31.140
And it's been tough because now people pretend

39:31.140 --> 39:32.860
to write hate comments just to get attention.

39:32.860 --> 39:36.340
So like anything, the public ruined the good thing.

39:38.340 --> 39:39.340
But it started that way.

39:39.340 --> 39:42.220
It started with people just shredding me to bits,

39:42.220 --> 39:44.500
calling me, spin-offs of this and that.

39:44.500 --> 39:49.500
And I think I'm a human more than I am a creator,

39:51.260 --> 39:53.340
an influencer, an attention seeker.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.060
Like I'm just a person.

39:55.060 --> 39:59.540
So to me, even at the size of 1.6 million subscribers now,

39:59.540 --> 40:03.340
September, 2022, I don't understand that I've gotten big

40:03.340 --> 40:04.620
and that I shouldn't do this stuff

40:04.620 --> 40:06.700
and that I should be beyond it

40:06.700 --> 40:09.420
or I shouldn't be checking my social media

40:09.420 --> 40:11.540
as much as I do and interacting one-on-one.

40:11.540 --> 40:13.380
I'm still very much a human being.

40:13.380 --> 40:16.860
And my guilty pleasure, my way of killing time

40:16.860 --> 40:18.420
if I'm not laying on the couch

40:18.420 --> 40:20.260
and playing some chess blitz games off stream

40:20.260 --> 40:23.740
is I just interact with people who say nice things

40:23.740 --> 40:25.260
and who say horrible things.

40:25.260 --> 40:27.220
And I really like to get into the head of the people

40:27.220 --> 40:28.820
who say the terrible things.

40:28.820 --> 40:30.940
And sometimes you can, sometimes they are truly trolls,

40:30.940 --> 40:34.540
but sometimes people just, they just really hate you.

40:34.540 --> 40:38.260
So what's the successful interaction

40:38.260 --> 40:40.940
with the person that's trolling you?

40:40.940 --> 40:43.360
What's like at the end of that hero journey,

40:44.360 --> 40:46.840
that you were partaking in?

40:46.840 --> 40:50.520
What's the top of the mountain look like?

40:50.520 --> 40:54.120
Is the troll conquered and broken mentally?

40:54.120 --> 40:56.400
Not mentally, I don't wanna defeat.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.680
I honestly, sometimes, somebody writes a very long comment.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.960
I'll respond with a question mark.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.400
Yeah.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.480
Oh, so you see each other as like a brother and sister.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.400
You're gonna travel together on this journey

41:08.400 --> 41:11.600
of deep meaning, like introspection.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.560
What does this mean?

41:12.560 --> 41:16.800
Yeah, I've had people write, I can't quote now,

41:16.800 --> 41:20.240
but something about my persona, my behavior, this and that.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.160
And I just like respond to them and I say,

41:22.160 --> 41:24.920
hey, it sounds crazy that a large creator

41:24.920 --> 41:25.880
might do something like this,

41:25.880 --> 41:29.160
but this kind of goes back to you speak to folks

41:29.160 --> 41:30.440
on a very respectful way.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.360
If you make a mistake, you completely own up to it.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.360
So I have this sometimes, these one-on-one interactions

41:34.360 --> 41:38.080
where I say, I think you're reading too much into this.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.000
I think you're kind of, you don't understand

41:40.040 --> 41:42.640
maybe some of my humor or sarcasm as such.

41:42.640 --> 41:46.080
So you form this opinion that I'm this kind of a person,

41:46.080 --> 41:48.040
this and that, and now you're sort of,

41:48.040 --> 41:50.520
anything I do, you're trying to attach to that reasoning

41:50.520 --> 41:52.880
and here you are writing this lengthy essay

41:52.880 --> 41:54.320
of why nobody should watch my content.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.160
And sometimes people go, you know what?

41:56.160 --> 41:57.000
I think you have a point.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.880
Maybe I should relax a little bit.

41:58.880 --> 42:01.600
Yeah, I would love to sort of interview

42:01.600 --> 42:05.120
and understand the lives of the folks

42:05.120 --> 42:06.360
that post that kind of stuff.

42:06.360 --> 42:07.960
I mean, they're human beings.

42:07.960 --> 42:09.960
They have interesting journeys also.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.360
I think they often don't realize,

42:13.280 --> 42:15.760
I think they don't realize their comment will be read

42:15.760 --> 42:17.880
by anybody, especially you.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.000
They think like, and they also don't realize

42:22.000 --> 42:24.320
you're a human being, I feel like.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.040
It's so interesting to watch it.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.640
Like some guy, because I posted on Twitter

42:31.640 --> 42:34.440
for like a minute that I'm talking to you

42:34.440 --> 42:36.120
and asking for questions.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.160
I deleted that tweet because,

42:39.080 --> 42:43.200
like 95% of the people were, talk about cheating,

42:43.200 --> 42:44.240
talk about the cheating.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.520
All right, I got it, thank you.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.400
This is not gonna be helpful at all.

42:47.400 --> 42:48.360
So I was like, all right.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.880
But in that time, there's one comment,

42:51.880 --> 42:55.480
which it's hilarious to me that you found that one comment.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.720
The one comment says, this seems like a waste of time

42:58.720 --> 42:59.720
or something like, why talk-

42:59.720 --> 43:00.600
Lame guest.

43:00.600 --> 43:01.440
Lame guest.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.040
Lame guest, lame guest.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.400
And then used, responded,

43:06.400 --> 43:07.840
something like with a question mark.

43:08.440 --> 43:10.080
I wrote, why am I a lame guest?

43:10.080 --> 43:10.920
Why am I?

43:10.920 --> 43:11.760
I just made a sad face.

43:11.760 --> 43:12.600
Let's talk about this.

43:12.600 --> 43:13.440
Yeah, I was like, why am I a lame guest?

43:13.440 --> 43:14.280
And he responded.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.000
He responded even after you deleted the tweet.

43:16.000 --> 43:16.840
Yeah, what did he say?

43:16.840 --> 43:20.920
He said, he doesn't know what value I would bring

43:20.920 --> 43:23.560
because I just make videos about chess games.

43:23.560 --> 43:24.400
And that's true.

43:24.400 --> 43:27.040
You've had some absolutely brilliant people on.

43:27.040 --> 43:29.560
But I also looked at this gentleman's profile

43:29.560 --> 43:34.320
and he was one of the folks that put things

43:34.320 --> 43:36.960
about his family and God and his politics

43:37.000 --> 43:38.480
in his Twitter bio.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.600
And I started thinking, maybe I said something

43:41.600 --> 43:45.560
in some video and I made a joke about religion

43:45.560 --> 43:48.280
or something, just some offhand five second thing somewhere

43:48.280 --> 43:52.800
that someone turns me into just an absolute outcast

43:52.800 --> 43:53.640
in the household.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.460
They can no longer watch me.

43:54.460 --> 43:55.300
And that has happened.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.140
That has happened.

43:56.140 --> 43:57.160
I'll record a 30 minute video

43:57.160 --> 44:02.160
and I'll make a joke about something and some phrasing

44:02.880 --> 44:03.720
and that's it.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.880
I've lost the viewer forever and they will let me know.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.000
They will write me an email

44:07.000 --> 44:11.080
and I just don't think people should be that serious.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.400
Yeah, there's some of that

44:12.400 --> 44:15.960
because I've seen people say that sometimes about me

44:15.960 --> 44:18.000
but I see it more with others.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.920
They'll say, I used to be like Joe Rogan gets this.

44:21.920 --> 44:25.240
I used to be a huge fan of Joe Rogan until he said this.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.920
First, I do wonder if you were ever really a big fan.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.880
That's one question mark I have.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.720
But the other is like,

44:35.720 --> 44:38.480
I think we should be more lenient with each other

44:39.440 --> 44:41.960
in terms of how much stupid shit we say.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.520
And if you actually,

44:46.520 --> 44:50.200
I wish people were able to sort of introspect on their own,

44:50.200 --> 44:53.600
on the stupid shit they say themselves,

44:53.600 --> 44:56.480
like to have a little bit of empathy.

44:56.480 --> 44:59.920
Like, I wish there was a way to read all the emails

44:59.920 --> 45:03.120
you've ever written and just to see,

45:03.120 --> 45:04.600
or maybe do a search engine

45:04.600 --> 45:07.480
for all the stupid shit you've said in emails in the past

45:07.480 --> 45:10.000
and like summarize it and to reveal it to yourself

45:10.000 --> 45:12.800
that like you have bad days, you have good days,

45:12.800 --> 45:16.680
you have emotional days, you have stoic days,

45:16.680 --> 45:20.560
you have sometimes you have like,

45:20.560 --> 45:22.400
you take very different political views

45:22.400 --> 45:23.320
than you do on other days.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.680
And it's like, it's all over the place.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.760
And if you're a creator,

45:25.760 --> 45:28.640
if you're putting stuff out all the time,

45:28.640 --> 45:31.840
you're gonna have those and you're still,

45:32.800 --> 45:37.480
you're still a full like complex bag of emotions

45:37.480 --> 45:40.960
and thoughts and ideas and contradictions and all of that.

45:40.960 --> 45:43.520
Like you shouldn't judge a person by a single statement.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.320
And even when you do,

45:45.320 --> 45:49.040
you should try to infer the best possible interpretation

45:49.040 --> 45:50.240
of that statement.

45:50.240 --> 45:53.040
I feel like that's just a healthier way

45:53.040 --> 45:55.400
to interact with the world and with other humans.

45:55.400 --> 45:59.560
It's like, I wonder what's the best possible interpretation

45:59.560 --> 46:02.880
of the thing they just tweeted or they said?

46:02.880 --> 46:06.760
Like what, let's imagine that the person saying those words

46:06.760 --> 46:08.840
is actually a really good human being.

46:08.840 --> 46:12.160
And what did they mean when they said

46:12.160 --> 46:13.680
that thing about anal beads?

46:14.680 --> 46:15.920
Right?

46:15.920 --> 46:17.120
So good for so long.

46:17.120 --> 46:17.960
Yeah, right.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.200
Or whatever it is, like, you know,

46:22.200 --> 46:24.840
they didn't mean to be offensive

46:24.840 --> 46:28.320
to the sexuality of a certain group.

46:28.320 --> 46:29.160
They're just talking about,

46:29.800 --> 46:30.640
they're talking shit about anal beads.

46:30.640 --> 46:33.560
Like they're not, like sometimes it's humor.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.560
Sometimes it's actually genuinely

46:36.840 --> 46:40.080
embodying like a political viewpoint

46:41.080 --> 46:42.920
and like walking with it,

46:42.920 --> 46:45.240
thinking through it for a few days.

46:45.240 --> 46:48.320
Like, like taking it seriously,

46:48.320 --> 46:50.320
empathizing not just for a brief moment,

46:50.320 --> 46:53.120
but for a time, like walking with an idea

46:53.120 --> 46:54.520
and allowing yourself to express it.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.960
Like playing devil's, I do that all the time.

46:56.960 --> 46:58.040
With yourself or?

46:58.040 --> 46:58.880
With myself, yeah.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.240
In conversation, I do too.

47:00.240 --> 47:04.040
And I find I have to say, I'm playing devil's advocate.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.520
Like you have to be very explicit,

47:05.520 --> 47:10.520
but with myself, I'll just do it in my head.

47:11.480 --> 47:12.640
Like I have different voices.

47:12.640 --> 47:16.720
Like, you know, obviously it just in,

47:16.720 --> 47:18.800
I've been getting so much information,

47:18.800 --> 47:22.440
so many thoughts in all the complexities

47:22.440 --> 47:23.880
of the war in Ukraine, for example,

47:23.880 --> 47:26.200
and all the different voices within Ukraine.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.000
I just interviewed hundreds of people

47:29.000 --> 47:30.440
and they have very different perspectives

47:30.440 --> 47:33.080
in nuanced ways about the war.

47:33.080 --> 47:36.040
Some are full of hate, some are full of love,

47:36.040 --> 47:39.160
like hate for the other, love for their own country,

47:39.160 --> 47:40.880
love for family and tradition.

47:40.880 --> 47:43.240
All of it, it's a beautiful mix.

47:43.240 --> 47:46.960
And I have to walk, I have to like carry those ideas

47:46.960 --> 47:49.680
in my head and empathize with them deeply.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.120
And then I have to listen to people that live elsewhere,

47:53.120 --> 47:54.040
that live in India.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.280
They have a very different perspective.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.400
There's a lot of people in India

47:56.400 --> 47:58.800
that have a very different perspective

47:58.800 --> 48:00.480
than the people in Ukraine.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.280
So I don't know, and some of that will bleed out

48:03.280 --> 48:05.880
into the thoughts I express publicly.

48:05.880 --> 48:09.920
And like when people judge you harshly for it,

48:11.520 --> 48:13.160
first of all, me as a human being

48:13.160 --> 48:15.520
is psychologically difficult,

48:15.520 --> 48:20.520
but also it makes me less willing to be fragile.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.480
I still try to be strong enough to be fragile

48:24.480 --> 48:25.320
in front of the camera.

48:25.320 --> 48:29.440
I just say things that are on my mind,

48:29.440 --> 48:34.440
even if I know it's going to create people

48:36.160 --> 48:41.120
that are going to be like ruthlessly negative towards me.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.040
So I try to wear my heart on my sleeve

48:43.040 --> 48:45.320
and still try to be fragile, but it's harder.

48:45.320 --> 48:47.480
You're gonna pay a psychological cost.

48:47.480 --> 48:50.600
Like in some sense, I try to be tough,

48:50.600 --> 48:53.000
but I can be a softie in that,

48:53.000 --> 48:58.000
in like certain attacks can get to me.

48:58.320 --> 48:59.920
So I'm surprised that they don't get,

48:59.920 --> 49:02.840
I mean, does some negativity get to you?

49:04.200 --> 49:06.680
Or is this the way you deal with it by responding?

49:08.000 --> 49:10.400
Like that guy saying,

49:10.400 --> 49:13.960
like what value does talking to add to the world?

49:13.960 --> 49:14.800
Yeah.

49:14.800 --> 49:16.560
No, but that was, I mean, that was so good.

49:16.560 --> 49:19.720
I was looking at, I was thinking at various moments,

49:20.600 --> 49:24.240
went to jump in and I was kind of letting you speak.

49:24.240 --> 49:25.560
One of the things I wanted to mention

49:25.560 --> 49:27.720
was it's significantly simpler to talk about chess

49:27.720 --> 49:30.160
than it is to talk about some of the things you talk about.

49:30.160 --> 49:33.400
And you have a big responsibility

49:33.400 --> 49:37.160
because you have to absorb information like a sponge,

49:37.160 --> 49:40.520
but you also then need to present it in a way

49:40.520 --> 49:43.200
where you potentially have an opinion

49:43.200 --> 49:45.760
while trying to be fair to everybody.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.920
And you're talking about things

49:46.920 --> 49:49.600
that will literally never please everybody.

49:50.560 --> 49:51.800
So you're gonna talk about some issues

49:51.800 --> 49:54.280
that are going to get out there into the,

49:55.720 --> 49:57.080
people are gonna watch it,

49:57.080 --> 50:00.560
the eyes, right, the years of millions of people,

50:00.560 --> 50:03.600
and not everybody is going to be satisfied.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.880
And these are issues where people are going

50:05.880 --> 50:10.600
to be much more likely to speak up in all sorts of ways.

50:10.600 --> 50:13.400
Tremendous support or tremendous hatred, vitriol,

50:13.400 --> 50:14.800
and God knows what else.

50:14.800 --> 50:18.240
Yeah, it's one of the reasons I'm blown away

50:18.240 --> 50:19.680
to even be sitting here, frankly,

50:19.680 --> 50:21.160
because up until a few months ago,

50:21.160 --> 50:22.600
you weren't talking to,

50:22.600 --> 50:23.680
I'm not saying you weren't talking to,

50:23.680 --> 50:25.160
but you hadn't spoken to chess players.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.360
You were speaking to people who were doing

50:27.360 --> 50:29.680
much more substantial things in the world.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.520
I appreciate the humility there.

50:32.840 --> 50:36.280
Chess, to me, is incredible, is a beautiful game.

50:36.280 --> 50:40.320
But I think the reason comments hurt is not,

50:40.320 --> 50:43.400
I mean, they hurt no matter what to me.

50:43.400 --> 50:47.000
Not to me, because I'm in a simpler space.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.360
That's what you have to understand.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.520
So if it's chess-based criticism,

50:52.880 --> 50:55.280
it doesn't hit as hard.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.320
No, if you had a podcast about,

50:58.680 --> 51:00.680
anal piece, no, I'm just, if you had a podcast.

51:00.680 --> 51:01.840
I'm launching this.

51:01.840 --> 51:04.720
If you had a podcast about photography,

51:04.720 --> 51:07.600
you gotta realize it wouldn't be the same way.

51:07.600 --> 51:10.200
You talk about potentially existential things,

51:10.200 --> 51:15.200
you talk about things in cybersecurity or AI,

51:15.600 --> 51:19.600
or people who are massive heads of companies

51:19.600 --> 51:21.120
that are just inherently going to be

51:21.120 --> 51:22.200
a bit more controversial.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.000
So that, I can't imagine being in your shoes,

51:25.000 --> 51:28.880
because you have so many complex emotions about situations

51:28.880 --> 51:31.320
where you may not necessarily agree with everything

51:31.320 --> 51:33.800
that someone has said publicly,

51:33.800 --> 51:35.960
but you still invite them for a conversation

51:35.960 --> 51:37.120
because they're a human being.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.280
It's totally different, Lex.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.120
It's not.

51:39.120 --> 51:41.520
I don't know, not the way I experience it.

51:41.520 --> 51:43.720
To me, I think what hurts,

51:43.920 --> 51:45.000
it's not even on my,

51:45.000 --> 51:46.320
because I'm super self-critical,

51:46.320 --> 51:48.720
usually way more than the internet can be,

51:48.720 --> 51:51.720
it's that human beings can be cruel to each other.

51:51.720 --> 51:54.120
So the reason it hurts for some reason,

51:54.120 --> 51:58.120
it's almost like disappointment in people.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.120
They don't give each other a chance.

52:00.120 --> 52:02.360
So in that sense, the negativity doesn't have to be

52:02.360 --> 52:04.080
about Ukraine or geopolitics.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.440
It could be about the silliest of things.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.280
I see.

52:07.280 --> 52:10.800
And to me, it's like, why be mean to each other?

52:10.800 --> 52:12.960
Why be mean to each other?

52:12.960 --> 52:15.160
In a context where the mean doesn't,

52:17.040 --> 52:18.840
it's out of place.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.120
For example, there is a gaming culture

52:21.120 --> 52:23.880
where they just talk shit to each other nonstop.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.200
I think it's more acceptable there.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.280
It seems to fit.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.000
It seems to be funnier there.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.600
When streamers talk shit to each other.

52:34.600 --> 52:37.680
I've been listening to several streamers recently,

52:37.680 --> 52:39.840
and it somehow works a little better,

52:39.840 --> 52:43.600
even if they're just cruel to each other,

52:43.600 --> 52:45.280
it makes more sense.

52:45.280 --> 52:49.000
But I think when people are genuinely trying to educate

52:49.000 --> 52:52.720
or to help and so on, and you still get the shitty comments,

52:52.720 --> 52:55.080
I don't know, it makes me sad.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.080
No, it doesn't make me sad.

53:01.040 --> 53:06.040
I think part of that is also the way I was brought up.

53:06.040 --> 53:09.200
So I skipped kindergarten,

53:09.200 --> 53:10.920
so I was always the smallest kid.

53:12.600 --> 53:14.080
You were picked on?

53:14.080 --> 53:16.200
I was picked on, and then I did picking.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.000
So I had kind of both in my life.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.760
I kind of know I went home from summer camp crying,

53:21.760 --> 53:25.000
and I also made a kid cry once in fourth grade.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.960
So I had the balance.

53:26.960 --> 53:29.360
Physical or mental abuse, or both?

53:29.360 --> 53:30.200
Verbal.

53:30.200 --> 53:31.040
Verbal.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.600
No, I didn't beat anybody up, I was tiny.

53:32.600 --> 53:35.200
I think the kid in the younger grade was bigger than I was.

53:35.200 --> 53:36.280
And you still broke him?

53:36.280 --> 53:39.880
Because I was, ah, I was, yeah, yeah.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.520
So I had to use my-

53:41.520 --> 53:42.600
Mental warfare.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.720
I had to use my words, I had to be.

53:44.720 --> 53:47.840
And growing up, my parents split when I was super young,

53:47.840 --> 53:49.040
and I played chess.

53:49.040 --> 53:53.960
So all things that make you super self-trustworthy.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.320
Like you believe your first instinct,

53:56.320 --> 53:58.920
you don't listen to what other people tell you.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.600
And if people give you advice, say,

54:00.600 --> 54:02.400
okay, I'm gonna think about that,

54:02.400 --> 54:03.800
I'm not gonna go and do that.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.240
I wasn't impressionable,

54:05.240 --> 54:07.600
you couldn't convince me to do something.

54:07.600 --> 54:08.520
That stuck to this day.

54:08.520 --> 54:12.840
My wife has had to deconstruct some of my stubbornness

54:12.840 --> 54:16.240
I didn't even realize was incredible stubbornness,

54:16.240 --> 54:17.960
is just something that you brought up with.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.480
So to me, that stuff doesn't bother me.

54:20.480 --> 54:21.640
And it's-

54:21.640 --> 54:24.400
So the voices of others don't shake you quite,

54:24.400 --> 54:29.400
they can't mentally shake your psychological stability.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.200
No, they haven't.

54:33.200 --> 54:37.240
I think when it got, probably at its worst point

54:37.240 --> 54:40.960
was in combination with being unable to perform well

54:40.960 --> 54:44.400
in over-the-board play, but that was also self-driven.

54:44.400 --> 54:47.960
I wasn't performing poorly because I was getting comments,

54:47.960 --> 54:50.920
but because I was performing poorly,

54:50.920 --> 54:52.720
the comments got to me more.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.600
The cycle was sort of in the opposite direction.

54:56.600 --> 54:59.640
And that was probably the most frustrating.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.400
People have said some vile things to me.

55:01.440 --> 55:03.520
You know about my whole Indonesia thing.

55:03.520 --> 55:04.360
Ooh, this is good.

55:04.360 --> 55:08.800
This is gonna give the anarchist and Lee Chess some humor.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.280
Let's go to what's the Indonesia thing.

55:11.280 --> 55:12.120
The way you said, okay,

55:12.120 --> 55:13.960
maybe we don't wanna talk about it,

55:13.960 --> 55:14.800
but let's talk about it.

55:14.800 --> 55:17.240
No, it's totally fine.

55:17.240 --> 55:18.160
Who did you kill?

55:19.440 --> 55:20.360
I was gonna say I wish,

55:20.360 --> 55:23.000
but I'm not even sure I can make a joke like that.

55:24.160 --> 55:29.080
So the Indonesia thing was I was streaming Chess.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.800
On Chess.com, I might add.

55:32.120 --> 55:35.000
And I got booted up a 10-minute game.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.080
Just a random account from Indonesia.

55:39.080 --> 55:40.040
That was the flag.

55:40.040 --> 55:43.640
Now, mind you, on these websites, you can pick your flag.

55:43.640 --> 55:44.880
It can be from wherever.

55:44.880 --> 55:46.160
It's not geo-tracing.

55:46.160 --> 55:47.000
You can change it.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I was like, okay, account from Indonesia.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.760
And as always, I looked at the account

55:50.760 --> 55:54.360
because it was an untitled, high-rated account.

55:54.360 --> 55:56.720
And I looked through the games.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.400
Win rate was suspiciously high.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.680
Average accuracy was suspiciously high.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.120
I was like, okay, I think this is a cheater.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.080
I said it out loud.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.960
It's not the first time I've played cheaters on stream.

56:07.960 --> 56:09.080
And I said, okay, I'm still gonna play.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.680
Let's see what happens.

56:10.680 --> 56:13.280
The game was not crazy suspicious,

56:13.280 --> 56:14.760
but definitely suspicious.

56:14.760 --> 56:17.560
A few critical moments where I just clearly thought

56:17.560 --> 56:19.080
I had a good position,

56:19.080 --> 56:21.840
and then the person or the bot played some move

56:21.840 --> 56:23.400
that just killed my hopes.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.720
And I lost.

56:24.720 --> 56:26.200
I was like, okay, I lost.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.440
And I wrote to the chess.com fair play team,

56:29.440 --> 56:30.280
like behind the scenes,

56:30.280 --> 56:32.360
I wasn't even saying anything publicly on stream,

56:32.360 --> 56:34.440
and the guy got banned.

56:34.440 --> 56:36.040
It was cheater.

56:36.040 --> 56:36.860
So that night,

56:38.320 --> 56:39.720
right before I'm going to sleep,

56:39.720 --> 56:42.320
because Indonesia's 12 hours ahead of New York,

56:42.320 --> 56:43.920
I'll go on my Twitter.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.880
What the hell is going on?

56:44.880 --> 56:47.880
I see hundreds of responses to my recent tweets.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.240
Levy, you gotta check Facebook, man.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.680
You gotta check Facebook.

56:50.680 --> 56:52.160
Like, here's a link.

56:53.080 --> 56:58.080
So allegedly that account belonged to an older gentleman,

56:58.840 --> 57:02.120
and his son made a Facebook post that said,

57:02.120 --> 57:05.880
my dad played a big streamer in chess, Gotham chess,

57:05.880 --> 57:07.000
and Gotham got mad.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.560
He lost to my dad.

57:08.560 --> 57:11.240
So his community mass reported my dad,

57:11.240 --> 57:13.080
and he was banned for cheating.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.480
Oh, it went viral.

57:17.480 --> 57:18.520
Oh no.

57:18.520 --> 57:19.760
Did you know that Indonesia

57:19.760 --> 57:23.440
has the fourth largest population in the world?

57:23.440 --> 57:24.280
I didn't know.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.440
I learned it the hard way.

57:25.440 --> 57:26.280
Interesting.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.320
Tens of thousands of DMs every second.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.280
Instagram DMs,

57:32.280 --> 57:33.240
because I had my DMs open.

57:33.240 --> 57:35.040
I was never afraid of that stuff.

57:36.400 --> 57:41.280
My YouTube videos went from 99% up vote, down vote,

57:41.280 --> 57:43.320
to 50, 50, 50.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.160
Oh wow.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.400
They swarmed my comments.

57:45.400 --> 57:46.240
So all negative.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.400
All negative.

57:47.400 --> 57:49.280
All, play him again.

57:50.280 --> 57:52.080
I mean, I don't know how much swearing there is

57:52.080 --> 57:52.920
on this podcast,

57:52.920 --> 57:53.920
but I mean, it was just all sorts of-

57:53.920 --> 57:55.960
All the fucking swearing you are.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.360
They-

57:58.360 --> 57:59.200
Just everything.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.680
Ruthless, the vicious-

58:00.680 --> 58:01.880
They were gonna kill me.

58:01.880 --> 58:04.200
They were going to rape my family.

58:04.200 --> 58:05.400
They were going to,

58:05.400 --> 58:09.720
they were contacting people I followed on Instagram.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.480
They were contacting them and telling them crazy things.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.480
It was, I'm not joking,

58:13.480 --> 58:16.000
it was tens of thousands of people every minute.

58:16.000 --> 58:17.960
It was unbelievable.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.880
And I didn't know what to do

58:19.880 --> 58:21.960
because the guy cheated.

58:21.960 --> 58:23.360
I was in the right.

58:23.360 --> 58:24.200
Yeah.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.040
People-

58:25.040 --> 58:25.880
How certain were you that he cheated?

58:25.880 --> 58:26.720
100%.

58:26.720 --> 58:27.540
Okay.

58:27.540 --> 58:28.380
100%.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.220
I'm okay.

58:29.220 --> 58:30.040
I don't know if you can say 100%.

58:30.040 --> 58:30.880
But-

58:30.880 --> 58:33.280
So just.com had also had a suspicion.

58:33.280 --> 58:34.480
They-

58:34.480 --> 58:35.320
What I-

58:35.320 --> 58:36.160
Because they have like good,

58:36.160 --> 58:37.560
they have like good detection algorithms.

58:37.560 --> 58:38.400
Yes.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.240
Danny Wrench would be able to,

58:39.240 --> 58:41.960
I legitimately know nothing about the behind the scenes

58:41.960 --> 58:44.000
because it's only kind of tech people.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
But one thing I did not realize was that this account,

58:49.680 --> 58:51.520
whether it was the son playing or the father playing,

58:51.520 --> 58:52.480
we will not know.

58:52.480 --> 58:53.400
We don't know who played.

58:53.400 --> 58:54.240
It could have been the son.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.920
It could have been the dad covering for him, whatever.

58:55.920 --> 58:59.560
But at some point that account won 27 games in a row

58:59.560 --> 59:00.720
at 95% accuracy.

59:00.720 --> 59:01.960
I mean, even Magnus can't do that.

59:01.960 --> 59:06.040
Even, you know, this took a month.

59:06.040 --> 59:09.240
This story took one month from start to finish.

59:09.240 --> 59:12.960
First, I had to work with like a media company

59:13.000 --> 59:16.760
to geo block my content in Indonesia on YouTube.

59:16.760 --> 59:19.520
So Indonesians could not see my channel.

59:19.520 --> 59:22.440
Oh, so you, you didn't want to like lean into it.

59:22.440 --> 59:24.560
Go full Donald Trump.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.400
No, no.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.720
Let's, let's, cause you're in the right.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.320
You feel like you're in the right.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.160
You, as far as you know, you're in the right.

59:31.160 --> 59:34.560
Yeah. And I hated watching all my work burn to the ground.

59:34.560 --> 59:35.400
Like-

59:35.400 --> 59:37.280
Oh, you, you felt it was being.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.760
Yeah. And I'm, one thing I'm learning about myself

59:39.760 --> 59:41.480
is I'm not a good crisis actor.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.200
I need someone to like slap me

59:43.200 --> 59:45.280
so I don't do something emotional in the moment

59:45.280 --> 59:47.480
when crisis is ongoing.

59:47.480 --> 59:49.320
What, what would be the emotional act

59:49.320 --> 59:51.120
that's not productive there?

59:52.640 --> 59:55.040
Partnering with an MCN that makes you give away

59:55.040 --> 59:56.200
a bunch of your revenue.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.520
And then when you break with them,

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.320
I wasn't monetized for a week.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.600
It was a very big decision to plug in.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.320
I think they're called MCNs, but-

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.160
What are they? Sorry.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.000
I don't, what are MCNs?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.840
They're like, we, there's, there's specialized agencies

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.880
that work behind the scenes with YouTube

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.520
that if you connect your account,

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.120
they say they can give you certain ad benefits.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.640
They can geoblock your content.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.400
They, which you can't do normally.

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:20.400
They have certain perks

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.280
that only YouTube allows behind the scenes.

01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.400
You pay them 10% of your monthly ad revenue,

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.880
but they claim to do a handful of things for you.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.560
I just needed them to geoblock my content.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.280
I, I just didn't, I didn't care how much money

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.320
I was going to give away per month, but-

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.600
Well, so why geoblock it?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.240
You just didn't like the, the downboating.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.360
Yeah, I didn't want-

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.720
You wanted positivity, more like you're being educational.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.760
You're, I mean, they're like, you do a bit of shit talking,

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.520
but it's more like fun and easy going.

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.640
You didn't want this kind of viciousness.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.280
Yeah, my comment section was just being completely flooded.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.800
Like they were destroying my channel.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.080
And to be honest, maybe all of the views

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.480
and the downvotes out of,

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.120
would have actually been beneficial.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.920
Maybe then my videos would have actually started

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.120
getting recommended to more people, but I'm a person.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.440
This is, it all goes back to the same thing.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.520
Oh, so this got to you.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.640
Yeah, this was like, I was just watching it

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:16.760
and I'm like, this is not fair.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.160
This is, I don't, I don't know what to do.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.000
So I'm going to stop this as much as I can.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.400
They still got through, they have VPN.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.120
And they were like, you asshole,

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.920
you don't think we have VPN in Indonesia?

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.280
It was this whole, you know, it was this whole thing.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.120
This father and son got invited to every major news network.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.040
I'm not joking.

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040
They got invited to the major podcast

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.240
and they like to say that Joe Rogan of Indonesia,

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.680
Daddy Corbusier is this mentalist.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.200
He's a bald guy, very fun guy.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.440
He had them.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.080
And that's when the Indonesian chess federation stepped in.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.680
The thing is nobody who was harassing me

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.240
knows anything about chess.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.160
They just saw the story.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.080
And long story short, they brought in a sponsor.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.760
The guy played a strong,

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.560
one of the strongest chess players in the country

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.640
who also happens to be a woman, Irene Sukandar.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.560
She's like 2,400 international master.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.960
She crushed him because his actual playing strength

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.840
is 1,300, 1,400, something like that.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.600
He still got paid because there was a winning prize fund

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.000
and a losing prize fund and we never heard from him again.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:20.840
And that was the whole story.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.520
So that was why I had to shut down all of my social media

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:27.880
to DMs and DM requests and even notifications.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.960
Like I don't get notifications unless it's someone I follow.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.360
But see, stuff like that doesn't often get resolved

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.560
in this kind of clear way.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.640
No, it doesn't.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.480
Could have been.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.160
So you got lucky there that there's a conclusion to this.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.520
Yeah, somebody got views, somebody got money.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.080
I never got many apologies.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.480
What did you learn from that experience

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.880
about yourself, about the internet?

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.560
I think first and foremost,

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.560
I learned that every moment you are live or broadcasting

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.800
can be completely blown out of proportion.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.080
You have to be real careful.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.560
And I can't actively think about that, unfortunately,

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.720
even when I'm streaming.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.960
I've had other instances where things come back to bite.

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.760
I've even had these moments live on stream.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.520
I feel like I said something too sarcastically to somebody

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.640
and I don't know how their day is going

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.000
and my ruin their whole day.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.280
God knows what, you have these moments of regret

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.040
where you want your personality to shine through

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.320
and you want to entertain.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.240
They start thinking at what cost.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.000
If I make a joke to a viewer

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.920
that suddenly the whole chat is laughing at them,

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.160
what if that puts them in a deep, dark place?

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.560
And again, it all comes back to this one-on-one thing for me

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.760
because I'm a human.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.960
I would hate to put another person into that situation

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.840
if I would much rather get a drink with somebody than,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.600
but it's all kind of part of this act

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.160
and you want to make jokes.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.360
I also learned I'm a horrible crisis actor,

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.400
so I have no patience,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.920
but I think that's normal in 2022.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.280
Everything is immediate.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.240
We can barely sit, think, let time go by.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.480
It makes me sad because I think that kind of stuff

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.880
can destroy good people.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.040
That's what makes you sad.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.560
Yeah, well, one of the things we discussed

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.480
just here before recording,

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.640
which I've talked about this on stream.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.640
I'm very open with this type of stuff.

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.680
I think for me, a lot of that comes down

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:25.600
to just a lack of control of the narrative.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.920
That phrase is kind of messy.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.400
It can be used for political stuff,

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:32.120
but I hate when I say things

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.560
and they get completely misconstrued

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.640
or they are completely misinterpreted

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.200
and I can't imagine being in your shoes

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.600
because again, I do chess.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.840
You cannot really, you can clip me saying something

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.840
about a chess game out of context and it's hilarious.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.240
It's dumb.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.680
It's nothing, it's not an attack on me

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.600
or something that I said.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:55.920
It's not an attack on,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.760
kind of more similarly to what you were describing.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.480
You don't say stuff like that,

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.320
like ridiculous, you don't say ridiculous shit about yourself.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.680
Oh, I do, I do, I do.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.240
And you don't feel like that could be made.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.480
Isn't this the same guy that said X?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.800
Maybe I either haven't said enough of those things

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.200
or there's no moments in,

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.640
I don't have three, four hour open conversations

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.560
with other humans and I'm pretty sure if I did,

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.880
there would be more of that stuff out there.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.520
But that's probably what it is,

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:33.520
is just a lack of being able to kind of control

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.000
what is actually reality and that is very frustrating.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:39.840
Yeah, you're right.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:42.040
I mean, there is a sense that there's not enough motivation

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.040
for people to attack you.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.640
You're ultimately adding a lot of positive stuff

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:49.840
to the world and when you get into more political topics,

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.040
there's people who are hurting,

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.720
who have a lot of anger in their hearts

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.160
and they want to direct it towards you,

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.560
so then they need ammunition.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:02.320
And ammunition comes in the way of clips from the past.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:03.480
So I'm sure that you,

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.520
I'm pretty sure you already have clips like that.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.560
It's just there's not people that really have anger

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.400
to direct towards you.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:13.880
Ultimately, you're adding a lot of good stuff to the world.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.880
And so, yeah, but it's, man,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.880
the viciousness of human beings

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.200
under the veil of anonymity at scale

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.800
can be really painful.

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.920
So I guess that's the curse,

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:31.320
the challenge of being a creator on YouTube and so on,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.160
on Twitch.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.200
When you talked about retiring,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:42.200
I think you tweeted about retiring from chess.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.760
I'm in a video, yeah, I tweeted.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.400
It's my value to the world.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.600
The tweet or the video?

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:49.440
No, I just.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.280
The both.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.120
Yeah.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.680
I'm retiring from all competitive chess events.

01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.240
My preparation is outmatched.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.600
My calculation skills are too flawed.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.200
And most importantly, my anxiety is beyond repair.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.200
I physically and emotionally cannot do it anymore.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.600
What was the hardest thing?

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.720
What was the hardest thing about competing?

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.400
Can you elaborate on that?

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.880
Yeah.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.400
I think it's separated into phases of my life.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.800
So after being a creator and coming back

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.720
and playing over the board

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.480
and making recaps of all my games,

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.400
I think the constant feeling that I had at the board

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.440
was a kid who hadn't studied enough for a test,

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.600
which is a very unique type of anxiety.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:42.200
And during the game, it was just self-hatred.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.400
Like good moves did not feel as good

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.040
as how bad bad moves felt and bad moments.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:51.720
And in the underneath that you're saying,

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:54.920
there's a sense that I did not prepare well enough.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.120
Unquestionably.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.600
So I'm an international master,

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:03.680
but there's international masters now who are 11.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.480
I got the title when I was 22, which is late.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.960
That might not sound like it's late, but it's really late.

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.960
And I quit chess multiple times when I was a teenager.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.280
If I hadn't, if one of my parents was like, sit down,

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.200
this is the only thing that you're good at, focus on it.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:23.600
Maybe I would have been a grand master,

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.200
but that's life, right?

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.240
And I would come back to chess at various points in my life

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.080
when I felt more mature, I felt more ready,

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.320
and I felt more motivated.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:33.160
It was all me.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.840
I had one coach when I was maybe about 10,

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.840
I never listened to the guy, great guy.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:41.640
Like he emailed me even recently, just wanting to catch up,

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:42.680
which I thought was adorable,

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.480
because I don't even know if he knows

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.080
that YouTube chess exists.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.280
He's in his seventies, he's just like a nice older guy.

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.400
And he would come to my house, we would have dinner,

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.400
and my grandma would make us food.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.600
And he would tell her that I'm brilliant, but I never work.

01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.960
And I have so much potential,

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.120
if only I ever worked at all, one minute on anything.

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.720
I just played speed games online and I...

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.800
Did he speak the truth there?

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.200
Could you have worked more?

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.480
I could have worked more, for sure, yeah, absolutely.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.680
When you listen to Magnus who doesn't,

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.560
he seems like he doesn't work either.

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.960
He works.

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.560
He might work in different ways,

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:24.160
but I think for him it's also obsession, again, love,

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.120
it's everything.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.840
He might read a book, he doesn't consider it work.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:30.560
It's work, he's getting information in

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.000
and he's learning something.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.880
It might just be easier for him to learn

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.840
than for me, for example, or for anybody.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.880
It just, everybody learns and absorbs things differently.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.880
So I would come back to chess and the best run of my life

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:48.040
that I had was in 2016, where I basically,

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.320
while teaching a chess program, scholastic chess program,

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.960
I told all the parents, hey, so for these four months,

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.440
I wanna stop doing private lessons

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.080
and I'm gonna go travel and play tournaments

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.520
because I wanna become an international master finally.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.320
20 years old, this is in 2016,

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.600
like can you help me raise some money?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.040
These are all managing directors, these are lawyers,

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.080
these are seven figure, eight figure households

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.840
and they contributed and I kept a blog

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.920
and then I worked just six hours, seven hours every day,

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.360
like studying all the opening trends,

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.320
all of the new ideas, reading the books,

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:26.640
analyzing my own games, playing my own speed games

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.440
and analyzing them, training every day.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.480
And that year I went from 20 to 40 over the board

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.480
to 24.04 with two of the three norms, as they call them,

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.160
which are basically tournament performances.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.680
Like you perform at a certain level, not too complicated.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.280
So I got almost everything I needed to be an IM,

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.760
but I just slipped up at the very end

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.000
and 2017 I didn't play chess, but in 2018,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.640
I came back once again with a vengeance,

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.960
I started playing in the summer once again

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.280
and I went up, up, up to my peak.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.240
But then something interesting happened.

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.480
My life mission was accomplished.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.920
I never wanted or thought I could be a grand master.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.520
I wanted to be an international master

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:14.360
and the adrenaline dump of hitting the IM title,

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.720
I just stopped working completely.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.000
I just completely stopped working.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.560
I couldn't and the second I started falling,

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.480
I couldn't stop and I spent the rest of the summer

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:30.840
just tanking and I said, ah, fuck this.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:34.800
I made my IM, I'm gonna fuck off someplace and whatever.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.400
I'll be IM, it doesn't matter.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.680
But when I play games online,

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.200
I mean, I destroy grand masters all the time.

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.360
Like dynamically, dynamics in chess

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.840
are just complex positions with all sorts of calculation,

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.000
attacking, defending, like very forcing lines.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.680
I think it's my best strength.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.200
I think I'm easily grand master level.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.680
So that you have the capacity to be grand master.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.520
100%.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.240
If the work was put in.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.480
If the work was put in

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.760
and I was not doing my current career,

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:10.600
if I just trained full time, I think I could do it.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:13.080
Do you have a desire to be grand master?

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.000
Did you have a desire?

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.360
You said I didn't really want,

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:18.240
like the main goal was international master,

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.120
which by the way is a really interesting,

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.600
just I've talked to Olympic athletes,

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.320
the crash after the gold medal.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.280
It's fascinating.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.760
I didn't get gold, but for me that was my goal.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.600
That was your goal.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.440
I mean, it doesn't matter.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.280
It's the goal.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.920
It takes a very, very special person

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:41.920
to not be destroyed by the gold and continue the dominance.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:45.080
It's to continue growing, to continue.

01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:46.720
I mean, it's hard to, that's why they talk about

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:50.080
it's hard to be a champion and defend your championships

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:52.440
or whatever the goal is to achieve the goal

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:57.040
and stick to like, yeah.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.240
Yeah, it broke me.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.080
It broke you.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:12:59.920
Yep.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.760
So you have the capacity to be a grand master.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.960
Have you ever thought, by the way,

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.160
is there still possible for you or are you fully dedicated

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.840
now to the love of creating and analyzing this game?

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.960
I don't think I'm going to do what I do right now forever.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:16.880
So-

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.560
Well, you're gonna die one day, just a heads up.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.480
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.000
I once cried when I realized that.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.400
It was at a funeral.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.240
It was very sad.

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.960
That's another entirely separate rabbit hole to go down.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.240
Which is when?

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.080
When did this happen?

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.920
Yeah.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.000
Just a couple of years ago.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.840
Yeah, it was rough.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:36.080
So you really were able to like,

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.640
like that, the realization really hit you.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.400
Like, fuck, this ends.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.680
Yeah, I'm the kind of person who,

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.880
I have my active thoughts in my brain

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.000
of things I have to get done.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.440
And the more of those, the better

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.960
because my brain will walk me off a cliff,

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.280
not the physical body, the brain itself

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:57.400
will walk off a cliff spinning in circles.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.680
So I try to keep myself as active as possible

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.840
on tasks I have to do.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.680
It's good and I'm busy.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.560
It's good I'm at the scale I am

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.880
because you can't really rest a whole lot.

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:09.360
But yes, that was, I have these moments in my life

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.520
where I have realizations of past fuck ups

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.040
or things I have, like I really have to do

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.480
that I've been like really doing poorly

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.280
or things like this, massive existential things

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.400
that just hit me like a, just like a bus.

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.080
There's several things tricky about it.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.720
So, cause I meditate on death a lot.

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.400
Like in this conversation, I imagine this is the last thing

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.680
both you and I do, just we're gonna die after this.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.120
So you meditate on that.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.160
But then you also have to,

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.400
I think what hits people really hard

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.120
is the realization that life moves on.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.880
Not only does it just end for you,

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.080
but most people will be like,

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.120
they'll, in your case, they'll tweet.

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.200
It's like, oh, he's so great.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.320
After there'll be so much outpouring,

01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:00.480
there'll be outpouring of love and so on for a day

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:05.480
and then it moves on and the new trees grow,

01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.440
new bridges are built.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.600
And then eventually human civilization ends

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.440
or moves over to Mars and so on.

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.880
And you'll be forgotten completely.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.200
But that for most people will come right away.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.880
Like you'll get a cancer diagnosis or something like that.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:22.960
And it's like, doesn't anyone else know

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.120
that I'm going to die?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.160
Does anyone else care?

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.960
Like nobody gives a shit.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.200
I mean, they do.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.960
I mean, there's love there, but like not in a dramatic way

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.000
that you would somehow deep inside hope for,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.960
that the world would stop because your life

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.880
is facing this catastrophic event.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.240
So, but I think ultimately what you could channel

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.680
that realization into appreciation of the current moment

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.080
and just the people you love

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.040
and sharing love with them as intensely as possible,

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.960
experiencing every moment as intensely as possible

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:02.480
because eventually there'll be a last moment

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.400
and after that there'll be no more moments.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.880
That's sort of what I do.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:10.680
Yeah, I try to channel all of that into, sorry.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:13.880
I don't use these fancy microphones in my own.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.200
You look uncomfortable.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.040
It's not your fault.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:16.880
It's not your fault, Levi.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.720
With this microphone?

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.360
No, with this line of conversation.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.200
Oh.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:23.920
I'm playing therapist.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.520
I don't know if I'm uncomfortable.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:29.160
I just, I don't know if I have a lot to say.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.800
Sometimes I just listen.

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:31.640
Yeah.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.080
Like sometimes I'm intimidated.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:33.920
It's not your fault.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.480
You say a lot of good things and I'm like, shit,

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.320
what am I going to say?

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.160
Like at the end of it.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.080
On this subject especially, I'm like,

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:42.920
that's sort of what I.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.240
There's nothing.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:46.720
What do you think happens after we die?

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.600
Oh man.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.520
No, that's a rhetorical question.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.360
What were we talking about?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.120
Grandmaster, grandmaster.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.880
So how hard is it to reach?

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.680
What are the requirements for grandmaster by the way?

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.120
Because yeah, and what are the requirements

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.200
for international master?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.880
You mentioned a few requirements and so on.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.240
Yes, so the first one is you have to know

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.320
how to use a Shure mic in an arm.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.680
You were impressed by the Shure microphone by the way.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:16.600
For people listening, we're using this Shure SM7B

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:19.480
that a lot of podcasters use.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:20.320
I don't know why.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:25.320
And Michael Jackson on Thriller, which Grimes told me.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:26.560
Really?

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:28.040
That's what, I think it looked a little different

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.000
but it's the same underneath it.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.600
A few musicians used it in studio.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.760
I don't know where it became popular

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.720
as a podcast and microphone

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:40.080
because I think most broadcasters use condenser mics

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.520
that look like really fancy.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.040
This looks a little.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.440
No, this one's great.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.720
It sounds really, really good.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.240
And I told you before that I wanted to use it

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:53.000
but it requires an external dashboard of some sort

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.600
and I'm way too lazy to learn how to do it.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.880
And my microphone doesn't sound that bad for YouTube

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:01.120
and for Twitch, but this is a long-term problem.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.320
I still have to figure out how to stream stuff.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.040
I haven't figured that out because.

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:07.120
You want to go down into the world of Twitch?

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:07.960
No, I don't.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.800
Okay, I don't.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.120
You just want to learn how to do it, just in case.

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.560
No, for, no, not Twitch.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:17.920
Do you know what we have over there?

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.280
So first of all, yes, it is.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:24.280
It's like, I feel like the hobbit going into like mortar.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.040
Like, yeah, Twitch is a very intense world.

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.000
But there is useful cases

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.200
when you should have your microphone work

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.120
with like the different, the processing chain

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:42.840
work in real time so you can do like interviews.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:46.240
And also I play, I try to play a video game once a month.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.640
So I've done that like three times already.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.440
So stream that kind of stuff for like an hour.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.520
Like play Skyrim.

01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.920
I like, I love playing Skyrim.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.840
I actually love the idea.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.720
I haven't done that yet, but apparently in Skyrim

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:05.000
you can turn off the monsters and you can just walk around.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.240
So I love the idea of just walking around in Skyrim

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.720
for a couple hours.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.720
And just like, because it's beautiful nature.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.600
I see.

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.080
Have you, do you know anything about those?

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.960
I know very, I know a little about Skyrim.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.000
But, so it's kind of like chat, no.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.040
Yeah, it's just beautiful worlds.

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:30.040
So there's games that are able to create this sense of,

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:32.320
you know, the way you feel when you go hiking,

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320
the sense of nature.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.200
Yeah.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.160
There, it's not that they're ultra realistic,

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:40.040
but they capture some majestic aspect of nature.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:43.120
I think some of it is also music, something peaceful.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:48.000
It's like old timey, medieval type of music.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.680
And just the trees, like the wind, like and you could,

01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:56.040
and then there's in the distance, there's the mountains.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:59.960
And you can like, you have a sense of history

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:01.680
that the nature gives you.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.120
You have a sense of space.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.640
Like this, you're like this tiny little creature

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.640
and there's this big world all around you.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.640
I don't know how, that's like an art

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.960
for a video game to create that.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:12.960
It's not just about the monsters in front of you.

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:13.800
Yeah.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.440
It's about this world and this feeling of a world

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.080
so I can just walk around and enjoy it.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.120
I get asked this question a lot.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.360
Why don't I stream more video games?

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.200
Yes.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.840
And I didn't know that such video games,

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:27.720
first of all, existed.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.920
I thought it was mostly just various sci-fi-ish characters

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.160
and shooting and objective.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.280
Call of Duty, yeah, yeah.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.840
I've played Overwatch on stream.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.880
It's the only video game I actually played a lot

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:39.960
and got decent at.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.640
And I couldn't play it on stream anymore

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.080
because my teammates would use racial slurs

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.800
in the voice chat.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.640
Yeah.

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.560
So that is it.

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.360
One of the, cause I've been thinking of talking

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:57.120
to a few streamers and they do, they're a little bit,

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.600
I don't know as far as, that community broadly

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.560
does use racial slurs and seem to make them okay.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.400
But for the ones I would talk to are a little bit,

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.720
they're just harsh in general in the intensity of language.

01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:13.320
And I don't know what to feel.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.760
Like I don't want to be the guy who says like,

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.760
kids these days with their mean language on the internet.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:24.080
Like you want to kind of adapt to the different communities.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:27.480
But at the same time, there is,

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:30.280
there's lines that you can cross, right?

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.000
Like if you make everything into a joke,

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.120
because that's what they kind of do.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.160
Everything ends in LOL, everything is funny.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.160
And that becomes, once again, a lubricant

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.040
that it's like a slippery slope that takes you to a place

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:52.040
where you actually make pretty mean ideas,

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.520
even evil ideas okay, because it starts as a joke.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.800
And so, I mean, you start getting into the territory of,

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.360
I mean, because I've been reading a lot on Hitler

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.600
and Stalin and so on, and you'll see those kinds of topic

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.240
come up in that community and it's like,

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:13.480
ooh, they have a very different perspective on that stuff.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.200
To them, it's just a fun, fun joke, fun time.

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:19.080
And I see that the contrast of that would call a duty

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.120
where you're shooting.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.120
And I love shooting and killing things in video games,

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.920
but there's a slippery slope there too,

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.280
because then just having visited the front in Ukraine,

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:36.080
you get to see the real killing of people

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:39.480
and you see how one can lead to another.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.480
It's non-obvious, but there's something that happens

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.200
in video games where you're like, well, this is not reality.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:52.160
The same kind of things happens in war.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.320
Well, the people on the other side aren't really human.

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:57.680
It does become a kind of video game.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:02.680
And that same mechanism, I feel like I wanna be cautious

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:06.800
about our brain going down that road.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:10.640
So yeah, I do worry about that community,

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.120
but there are video games

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.040
that don't have such communities around them.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.080
I think Skyrim, I don't think Skyrim

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.680
is an online component of people.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:22.480
Minecraft, I think is relatively civil

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.680
from what I've seen.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:24.520
Interesting.

01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.840
Good community, I think right now it's booming.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:28.560
It's a lot of young creators

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.960
who are all seemingly quite close.

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.960
And I think the community then extends to social media.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.840
Some of them are intense, but who isn't?

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:44.320
And I think they foster a more or less

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.520
kind of good group of folks, but no, I completely agree.

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.600
I think a lot of that stuff,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.520
and combined with the anonymity stuff

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.440
that we mentioned earlier, totally dehumanizes

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.920
the way people interact with each other.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.920
And it's scary, I don't know.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:02.600
Combine that with two years

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:05.240
of some people barely going outside.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.800
Yeah, with COVID, yeah.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.680
It's not a good mix, it's not a good mix at all.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.440
I mean, you'd like to think that folks,

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:12.120
it's like in their teenage years,

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.200
kind of go through those and they mature out of it and stuff.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.040
So they start to realize the weight of their words.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.040
That's my hope.

01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.840
But we're all trying to figure that out,

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840
how the internet has changed youth.

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.840
Like easy access to porn,

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.920
easy access to some dark communities

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:34.840
where dark ideas breed.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.200
I don't know.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.080
But then again, I trust in the goodness

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.120
and the intelligence of people at the end of the day.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.880
And I think kids will, now I sound like an old man,

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.400
it's good for kids to play with different ideas

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.520
and then they grow out of it, hopefully.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.320
But then you have to have parents and good school

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.440
and like good friends that kind of call them out

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.640
and they're bullshit.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:55.480
You need that.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.280
If you're stuck inside under anonymity,

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:01.960
maybe you don't have some of those signals.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.800
Kids these days with their internet.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.000
I had to go through this.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.680
It's kind of what I mentioned.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.920
So I didn't have two divorced, my parents were divorced.

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:13.240
I didn't have two households, I had three.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:14.080
So I had-

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:14.920
There's the third one.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.440
So I went to school most of my childhood

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.560
in a town where my grandmother lived.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.120
And she was kind of like the Switzerland.

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.080
So I would be with her and my mom would come with me there

01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.200
half the week.

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.600
Dad would take me to his place

01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:35.320
for the other half of the school week.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.560
And then my parents would split weekends.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.480
My mom's weekends were in New York

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.840
where my stepdad was and that family.

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:43.200
So three houses.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:46.680
So grandma, your dad's and then mom.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:49.480
So step siblings there and there.

01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.200
New people there and there.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.040
Extended family there and there.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.840
And also at grandma's where I would come

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.200
anytime I had a conflict.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:59.680
And when I was 12 and 13 and being just a total lunatic,

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.240
emotional manipulator of all folks in my family

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.560
and I was just teenager rebelling

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.560
and also having to deal with three different households.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:09.560
And I mean, I carried a backpack,

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.800
the same backpack literally that I, not the physical one,

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.400
but what's inside of it that I carried.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.440
Like when I came here to record the episode

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.880
and have my stuff in the hotel,

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.280
a backpack with a laptop, a bunch of clothes,

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.880
a bunch of other things that I need throughout the week,

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:27.200
deodorant, things like that.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.960
I mean, of course you start getting that stuff

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:31.920
in all the houses, but that was the way I lived

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.560
for some of the most important

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.520
developmental years of my life.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.520
And who knows if I had too much of what we're describing,

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:42.320
one sprinkle of this too much,

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.360
if I had someone influence me in a negative way.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.200
Luckily I managed to steer clear a lot of a lot of it.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:53.640
Yeah, how did you not get into trouble with the internet?

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:55.520
Meaning like, how did you,

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.160
what was your experience with the internet?

01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:03.160
So having to move a lot, having to have multiple households,

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.800
just psychologically difficult upbringing.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:09.880
I, yeah, it was extremely tough.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:13.720
I, it's hard to speak about it now

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.600
because I'm in a completely different mental state.

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.800
I don't even remember some of like those moments,

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:18.640
but I-

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.480
It's almost like a different person.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:21.240
Yeah, that's exactly how it feels.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:24.840
But I remember I had a big video game addiction,

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.560
just like most teenagers.

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.640
I want to say teenagers, but probably teenage boys,

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:29.920
but I'm not, I don't know.

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.920
I don't know how addicted teenage girls are to video games.

01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.680
Yeah, sure there's some data on that.

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:40.360
I definitely look back on things that I did

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.000
in certain instances, like,

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.480
well, I was a teenager, that was stupid.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.360
Oh, I scammed somebody in some video game.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.320
No, that was, you know, I was, wow, that's hilarious.

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.520
Like in just, I was, it was just an idiot teenager.

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:55.160
Like I didn't do anything unforgivable, luckily.

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:59.840
And for the most part, just kind of went about my life.

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.760
And I somehow got older

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.760
and started getting more independent

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:08.680
and stopped playing video games.

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:11.840
And to be honest with you, I would love to sit here

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.720
and say I have some sort of logical explanation

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.760
of why I am the person I am today.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.080
But I think you need elements of the right upbringing

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.480
and support system, as you said, and you also need luck.

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.560
You just, I've been in some situations as a teenager

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.280
where I almost got, I almost got killed by some gang members.

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.640
That's a very exaggerated story,

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.680
but I was in a park in New York City

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.880
and I got into it with a kid whose brother

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:41.760
was in a notorious gang of that neighborhood.

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:44.640
And he told me his brother was gonna come and kill me,

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.320
basically, over a stolen basketball.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.640
And I was, I was gonna fight this kid,

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.680
cause I was 14, you know, he stole my basketball.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:50.520
Of course I'm gonna fight this kid.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.920
This kid was like 12, he had a pierced tongue.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.240
Like this wasn't a joke.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.680
This kid was from a totally different way of life.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.480
And his brother did show up, but his brother was like,

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.240
I'm not gonna, this kid's like, I was a little teenager.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.200
Now 14 year olds are six feet tall,

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.840
maybe something would have happened to me.

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:10.480
But I was a little kid and his brother was like,

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.400
but looking back at that is crazy

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.160
because I definitely had some of these moments

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.080
in New York City more than anywhere else,

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:20.800
cause it's such a big place, but luck, you need some luck.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:23.080
Yeah, it's kind of funny that there's certain moments

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:27.200
in life on which the entire trajectory of your life can turn.

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.040
Yeah.

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:31.200
And then they're all, like in that case, nothing happened.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.040
But, you know, I most intensely feel this

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.960
when I get almost run over by a car kind of thing.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.720
How many times have you almost get run over?

01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.960
I don't know, maybe it happened like twice in my life.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:43.480
Okay. That kind of stuff.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.280
Like when somebody runs a red light.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:46.120
Yeah.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.760
That happened to me here in Austin.

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.800
You realize, oh shit, that was,

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.920
like your life flashes before your eyes.

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.920
And those moments can turn.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.720
And then there's more meeting certain people

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:01.640
where you meet them and for the positive,

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:06.640
they're like, wow, this moment of inspiration,

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.320
like, wow, this is possible.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.400
Wow, this kind of person can exist.

01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.560
Maybe I can be that kind of person too.

01:30:13.560 --> 01:30:16.400
So yeah, those things can like change the direction,

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.240
but maybe not.

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.000
Maybe they just reveal something that was already there

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.160
and the momentum is always carrying you forward

01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:23.840
into a thing that you are always gonna end up in.

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.080
Yeah, I wonder about that.

01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:29.120
Speaking of teens doing stupid things,

01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:32.440
let's return to the Magnus Hans saga.

01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.480
I know, yeah.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.080
How did it start?

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.880
Who is Hans Nieman?

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:39.440
Who is Magnus Carlsen?

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.280
How did it start?

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.520
There's three games.

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.560
It started in Miami.

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:45.800
Yeah, a good background story is Magnus Carlsen

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.840
is the arguable greatest player of all time.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.320
Very close, I would say, to Garry Kasparov,

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.760
world number one for now over 10 years.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.560
At the top of his game, you think?

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.800
Like close to the top of his game right now?

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.800
After the most recent thing, yes.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:05.120
I think he has the uncanny ability of top athletes

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:09.720
to absorb the bullshit and show,

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.400
oh yeah, dad's home now.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.240
Yeah.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.160
Run, I was only trying 70% before that.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.880
And I think that's what he,

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:18.800
I really think that's what he showed.

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:19.640
I was in awe.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.080
If Magnus is playing in a tournament,

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.640
yes, it's good for views to put him in my YouTube thumbnails

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:26.120
and make the video title about him

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.680
if he does something brilliant.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.400
But I was legitimately just blown away.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:32.480
It wasn't even, it wasn't farming him for content.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.840
This is unbelievable what he's doing to people.

01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.080
And he has a point to prove.

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.400
Hans is a, I believe he's 19 years old right now.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.160
He's an American.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.160
I don't know if prodigy is necessarily the right word.

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:49.200
Prodigies, you know they're prodigies from very, very young.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:52.240
In chess, you don't become a prodigy at 18.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.280
But he was always a good junior player.

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:57.840
He was always a very unique character.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.760
Like I met Hans when he was 11, 12 years old.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.440
He was this little kid, just trash talking folks

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.920
at the Marshall chess club.

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:07.040
And he already had a reputation, literally.

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:10.280
Like he had a reputation with counselors.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.280
And the truth is I was similar.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.480
I was kicked out of chess camp

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:16.040
by one of the best chess grandmasters of all time,

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:16.880
Artur Yusupov.

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:18.640
I was in a chess camp when I was nine years old.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:19.680
What'd you do?

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:21.000
I was just an asshole.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.160
I was too strong.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.360
So I helped other people with other work.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.200
I was loud.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.320
And you let your ego shine.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.160
I was a kid.

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.800
I mean, I wouldn't.

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:30.880
Not every kid lets their ego shine, but some do.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.720
Oh, yes.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:32.640
You did.

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.760
Hans does, there's interviews when he's young.

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.520
Or like he's kind of talking shit.

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.480
But it's entertaining.

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.320
Yes.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.920
What I try to stay away from is just,

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.240
yes, I let my ego shine,

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.400
but I don't think I even knew what any of that was

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.240
when I was younger.

01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:49.800
I was just a loud, boisterous kid

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.840
from a household where I wasn't paid attention to

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:53.200
because I had three of them.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.480
So I just was like,

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:57.320
here's where I'm gonna show up and get my attention.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:59.840
And Artur Yusupov, he's a great, great man.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:00.880
I drove that man crazy.

01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.160
He was like top five in the world at some point

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.440
in the 80s and 90s.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.160
He said, it's either me or this kid.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.000
Oh, wow.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:08.840
So you really got to him.

01:33:08.840 --> 01:33:10.000
Yes, he said, I'm not gonna come back

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.080
and teach camps unless it's me.

01:33:11.080 --> 01:33:12.520
And I remember going through this.

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.720
I have very vague, distant memories of this.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.480
My dad calling, apologizing.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:18.320
And-

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.320
Did it make you feel good that you got to a grand master?

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:21.520
No, I felt horrible.

01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:22.360
I felt guilty.

01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:24.120
I felt guilty my whole life about it.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:28.040
I very rarely feel proud of bad things or I showed them.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.160
Even things, it gets to the point

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.080
you feel guilty about things you didn't do.

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.680
That's when your brain really goes crazy.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.640
Yeah, I'm with you on that.

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:41.160
So, okay, so you can relate to the hunts.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.480
Yes, to young hunts.

01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:47.520
And he was like in and out of chess.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.000
This is what I remember.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.120
He was around the rating of 2300.

01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.640
And I remember looking at some of his games

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.480
in a tournament in Philadelphia.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:33:59.360
And I was like, there was some game that he played

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:00.440
and he didn't know the opening.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:03.240
It was like a London, which is a very popular opening,

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:04.080
some theoretical.

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:06.960
And I looked at him like, whoa, he didn't know that?

01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.200
Okay, that's crazy.

01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:09.760
And then I just kind of walked by

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.920
and I saw him in a tournament a few months later

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.520
and he did something very rare where in an open tournament,

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.680
not a tournament of 10 players

01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.400
or everybody plays everybody, open tournament,

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.400
randomized pairings, depending on how many points you have,

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.280
he played nine grand masters, which is crazy.

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:26.440
That means he was performing so well, so consistently.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:28.640
That was where he got his first IM norm.

01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.480
It's like, oh, here it is.

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:31.560
Here comes that like boom of a young player

01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.120
where he gets mature, he gets back into the game

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.000
and he gets stronger.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.080
I don't follow a whole lot, pandemic happens

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.720
and he starts streaming a bit

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:45.560
and he's boisterous, he's kind of like loud,

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.320
he's talking trash and he's gaining rating constantly.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:51.520
He's just, but so are a lot of people.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.400
So you don't think much of it.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.720
And then now you can go play over the board again,

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.000
live tournaments, face to face, as opposed to online events.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.760
And he's like, I'm gonna go to this tournament.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.720
I'm gonna win it.

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.800
I'm gonna get my last GM norm.

01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.280
And he does.

01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.480
And then he's like, all right, my goal is this rating

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.960
by the end of this year.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.800
He gets it.

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.840
He just demolishes absolutely everybody.

01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.520
And you're like, this guy's for real.

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.360
Over the board.

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.440
They're like, this guy's for real.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:16.560
There's a lot of people like that.

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.680
If you look at the top juniors of the world, it's crazy.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.000
Ali Reza Farooja, 2,800.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:23.480
Vincent Khymer, 2,700.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.160
A bunch of kids from India, 2,700.

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:27.000
Similar age or younger usually.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.360
One or two years younger,

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.200
maybe a little older by a year,

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:34.040
but it's just this wave and you're just hype for the guy.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.320
Like this is fucking awesome.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.840
Like we got a young American guy who shit talks

01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.360
every time he's on camera

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.640
and he beats everybody he plays.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.840
But then you start hearing sprinkles here and there,

01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:46.840
maybe in some stream.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.480
Oh, I think he doesn't get to play on chess.com anymore.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.600
Like chess.com doesn't put that badge there

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.120
on the account sometimes.

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:57.840
Sometimes they just tell the player, listen, we know.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:00.240
And the player's like, all right, you got me.

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:01.080
And that's it.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.440
There's no conversation.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.800
So there's like these sprinkles, but people cheat online,

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:06.960
especially when they're young.

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:09.160
It's very captivating.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:10.840
It's a very nice thing to do.

01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.480
Just to be clear, I mean, just to make explicit

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:15.760
that the accusation, and I think it's proven,

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.080
but they're still being shady about it,

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:22.560
to the degree it's done is that he cheated on chess.com

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:24.040
when he was 12.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.280
12 and 16, that's what he said.

01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.120
That's what he said.

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.000
That's what he admitted to.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.520
But right now chess.com put out a statement

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.520
and now Magnus put out a statement as well saying,

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.920
we think it's more than that.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:37.320
Yeah, I've talked to Daniel

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.600
because he wants to come on the podcast,

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:42.560
which I'm actually kind of interested in.

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.520
I think he's a cool person.

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.760
And they're also doing some really interesting

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.320
anti-cheating stuff, which to me,

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.640
from an algorithmic perspective is interesting,

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.880
but he is also the man.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:59.000
In every field, there's the institution.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.920
So he represents the institution

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.800
because chess.com is the institution.

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.080
It's like in the Olympics, it's the IOC.

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:11.080
It's like, I have to be careful.

01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:13.120
Well, in chess, FIDE is the institution.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:13.960
FIDE, okay.

01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.080
Yeah, but chess.com.

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:18.520
They've outgrown, way more people actually know chess.com.

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.080
Way more people know me.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:21.480
Way more people know Hikaru.

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:22.320
It's one of the reasons that-

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.680
It's interesting where the power lays.

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:25.360
Who has the most power?

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.200
Interesting.

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.560
Yeah, chess.com has the most power.

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.200
Well, I don't know, maybe you and Hikaru do.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:32.800
No.

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.320
To steer public opinion, you know?

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.080
That's a very good question.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.440
I have to think with my evil cap now.

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.520
What would happen if-

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:44.080
I'd rather you have the evil cap than Hikaru

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.560
because I feel like he would really,

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.920
the power absolute,

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.640
if the two of you ruled the world, it'd be a problem.

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.040
You mean side by side or rivals?

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.040
Yeah, it would be like, yeah,

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:56.920
as rivals, there would definitely be a war.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:59.560
It's one of the reasons I would not chess box him.

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.680
Do you guys, how much do you like each other?

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.200
I mean, do you admire each other as fellow-

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.720
I can tell you how I feel.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.880
As fellow entertaining.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.480
Well, we should finish Magnusson's.

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.440
Yes, that's good.

01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:16.080
I know, I feel like just inside,

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:16.960
we don't want to talk about it

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.640
because it feels like it's been talked about so much.

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:19.480
I'm trying to give a very-

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:23.080
No, for you, just remember, for me, it's much less.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.840
Yeah, and for the listener, it might be zero.

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.400
The listener is zero, yeah.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:27.240
So-

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.040
Like Rogan asked me, like, so what was this?

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:31.040
I know, I heard him even talking.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.040
What's this chess?

01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:34.600
You know, Joe talked about the Indonesia thing.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:35.440
Oh, he did?

01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.360
In some super random small thing,

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.200
and that was a very funny moment for me.

01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.160
I told him about this drama a few weeks ago,

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.920
and then he was like, yeah, this is interesting.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:44.760
Is it Antelope's?

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:45.600
Is that possible?

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.440
Is that good?

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.160
I was like, yeah, I think it's possible.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.640
I don't remember how drunk we were,

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.240
but so even, he's curious, he doesn't really know.

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.600
But anyway, cheating when he was 12, when he was 16,

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:00.920
as he said, he admitted to cheating online

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.280
when he was 12 and 16.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.800
Yes, but for timeline's sake, let's just do it this way.

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.640
He has a lot of over-the-board success,

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.480
but nobody really talks about the online cheating stuff.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.800
It's sort of kind of kept low-key, couple hundred people,

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:16.800
maybe a couple thousand people, which sounds like a lot,

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:19.120
but it's not because there's millions of viewers

01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:20.000
know about this.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.760
It's generally kept kind of low-key

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.720
because historically, if you cheated online as a teenager,

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.960
you're not cheating over the board.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.720
It's not possible, you will get caught,

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.000
nobody has ever attempted it.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.840
We've had over-the-board cheaters,

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.800
but not at the ultra-elite level.

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:40.920
And so what happens is they play this tournament in Miami,

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:45.360
and the first day, Hans loses three nothing.

01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.240
This is important because on the very next day,

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.080
it's not like Hans was destroying every day.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.680
The second day of the tournament,

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.440
he sits down, game one versus Magnus,

01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:57.160
in their best of four, and destroys him.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.920
Like, he destroyed him.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.840
Made it look like I was playing in Magnus' shoes,

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.000
the level difference, it wasn't close.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:11.440
Of course, we can argue it might be because of the,

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.640
maybe Magnus knew something ahead of time,

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:17.560
there's obviously the psychological element, not important.

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:21.840
Hans leaves, they say, interviewer says,

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.920
Hans yesterday, by the way,

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.760
horribly phrased the interview question.

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:29.760
He goes, Hans, yesterday was terrible for you.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.160
And today you start with a masterpiece.

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.000
What do you have to say?

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.920
Chest speaks for itself, walks away.

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:39.720
Argue, you can argue, it's cringe, you can argue.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.680
I thought it was cool.

01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:43.320
And then the guy then keeps asking a question

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:45.040
with his arm extended because he's so shocked,

01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:45.880
he doesn't know what to do.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:47.280
Like, he didn't even occur to him

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.320
how ridiculous it looked to be asking.

01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:52.560
And then not only does Hans come back

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.400
and loses the best of four,

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.320
he loses like two more games or maybe three,

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.960
I think he loses the next three games.

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.280
He then proceeds to lose every single best of four match

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:03.880
for the rest of the tournament.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:07.200
He ends with zero points and a prize money of $0.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:11.120
They put up the graphic and he put Neiman zero.

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.120
I think he got some minimum, right?

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.360
So it's like, wow, this is like insane.

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:18.000
This guy comes out with this crazy interview.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:19.840
And in my recap videos, I was like,

01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:21.080
the next time Hans has success,

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.440
he has to stay away from the cameras.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.120
Don't let him talk, just don't let him talk.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:24.960
It's gonna be bad luck.

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.800
You know, I'm joking around.

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:26.960
Like next time he plays, it's crazy.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.000
He's gonna...

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.240
So that was their kind of first interaction there.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.520
They also, there were some photos.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:34.040
They were having fun playing on the beach.

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.480
I don't know whether they had a chessboard on the beach.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:36.320
Chess players are such stories.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:37.160
Magnus and Hans?

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.240
Yeah.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:39.920
So they were still getting along.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.240
I guess so, yeah.

01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:43.080
It's interesting, because I talked to him at that time.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.960
Would he have mentioned something?

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.800
Right.

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.800
I wonder what he would have said

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.240
if I asked him about Hans, because that was clueless.

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.480
Did anyone care about Hans?

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:51.680
No, no, no, no.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:54.480
Hans is not a super known entity, right?

01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:56.240
He became much more known.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:59.960
He became probably a top five all-time popular chess player

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.200
in the last three weeks.

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.720
Yeah, so it's not, it wouldn't even be a worthy question.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:08.280
No, you don't know.

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.760
Maybe Magnus already kind of knew.

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:12.080
A lot of the top players, it seems,

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.720
are coming out now and saying we already were suspicious.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.160
It seems like Magnus might have known,

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.920
but maybe not enough to address it.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:21.040
He still might not be willing to address it.

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.880
Yes.

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.920
But anyway, so totally horrible tournament performance

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.840
after Hans beat Magnus.

01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:30.760
Then the annual tradition

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.320
of the St. Louis Tournament happens,

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:36.000
which is a strong field of players first

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.400
for a fast tournament, rapid and blitz,

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.360
and a classical tournament.

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.200
And the classical tournament is the Sinkfield Cup.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:45.200
It's named after Rex Sinkfield,

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:47.160
billionaire chess philanthropist.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.160
And it's like St. Louis Chess Club is a prestigious place

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:54.920
and the host of a prestigious tournament.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.000
Hall of Fame is there for chess.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.600
I don't know if it's U.S. Hall of Fame

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:02.080
or Worldwide Hall of Fame, but yeah, it's the tournament.

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.520
Other countries play chess?

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.080
They do, but I don't know who determines

01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.000
where the Hall of Fame gets to be.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
If we say it's the Hall of Fame, okay.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:12.680
One day some other part of the world's gonna be like,

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:14.360
actually, it's over here.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:18.160
So basically what happens is we have a field set

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:19.200
for the Sinkfield Cup.

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:22.560
Set, it's the top 10 players in the world.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.720
Some can't make it, so okay,

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:26.480
you get number 11 in there or something.

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.800
One of them can't come

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.840
because of something related to coronavirus.

01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:34.440
It's not, now we're gonna get a little asterisk on Spotify

01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.600
because it was mentioned.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.480
Get more info about COVID-19.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.600
So I don't know why he couldn't come, but he couldn't come.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.320
Something happens, he can't make it.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.800
Hans Nieman is the replacement.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.120
Yeah.

01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:50.000
At the time, we didn't know this,

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.440
but now weeks later we knew Magnus wanted to not play.

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.120
This is very important.

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:58.120
Back then we didn't know.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.640
Apparently some other top players also didn't wanna play.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.720
They also were suspicious.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:04.880
They also wanted increased anti-cheating measures,

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.440
which by the way in chess are dog shit.

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.800
You give this little metal wand

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.320
and you put it on the little ears, body,

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.520
and there's apparently an argument

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.240
a micro earpiece would not be caught,

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:19.200
something in the armpit vibrating would not be caught,

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.440
something in the shoe.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.920
They don't make the players take their shoes off

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:23.960
because it's too elitist.

01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.880
How are you gonna make players take their shoes off?

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.480
That's, oh my God.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.800
But if these things are out there.

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:32.920
Or if anything was inside any other orifice.

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.000
Correct, yes.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:34.920
I have to bring that up.

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:38.440
I mean, to be honest, yes, that is very truthful.

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:41.920
If nothing else, this podcast is about honesty and truth.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.280
So I have to be complete.

01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.600
And transparency.

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.640
So what ends up happening in this thing field cup

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:49.280
is Magnus ends up still playing,

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.640
but the anti-cheat measures are not introduced.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:54.880
So the first few games,

01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.320
Hans has a very, very impressive first round game

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.360
against Levon Aronian,

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.880
one of the best players in the world.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.720
Okay, draw.

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:03.360
He was pushing, draw.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:07.760
Second game demolishes like a top player.

01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.280
Mamadiarov crushes him.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:12.880
Dominant opening, but not like a perfect game.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:13.720
You understand?

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:17.120
Like it was, he made some inaccuracies here and there

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.520
and he ended up winning in a complex game.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.600
This game three happens versus Magnus.

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.600
And not only does he beat Magnus with the black pieces,

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.160
he dominates him from start to finish.

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:38.360
So in the opening, Magnus played something with white

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.880
that he had maybe played once or twice before.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.160
There was some big debate about it.

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.240
I'm not gonna get into it.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.680
Basically a very niche, small thing

01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:51.680
that just he had never played in maybe a long game before

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.680
with some sprinkled in venom

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:57.240
that might get Hans off guard.

01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:59.360
Hans proceeds to play like the first 15, 20 moves

01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:01.160
absolutely perfectly

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:05.600
and then converts the game into a slightly better end game

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.600
and squeezes Magnus to death.

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.280
Basically beats Magnus with black

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:11.280
which nobody had done in years

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:14.000
the same way Magnus would have beaten other players.

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.560
Then he goes and gives this interview

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:19.320
which where he claims that he had looked

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.600
at those first 15, 20 moves right before the game.

01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:23.720
Basically he got lucky.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.760
Didn't he say he looked at something very similar?

01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.480
No, no, it was either similar

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.520
or literally that exact variation

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:31.520
which is possible.

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:32.360
I've done that before.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.600
One of my best wins of my life.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.680
That morning I went, you know, I'm not prepared.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.840
What if my opponent plays this

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.480
Queen's Gambit accepted variation?

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:40.520
And I literally learned the first 12 moves.

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.000
He didn't know move 12, I killed him, okay?

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.200
Like it just happens.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.040
Yeah.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:48.800
Unfortunately, when you combine that

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.840
with other small elements of the interview

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:54.040
and now there's body language experts going all on this,

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.000
it was odd.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.760
He gave an interview afterwards

01:46:56.760 --> 01:47:00.160
explaining various details of the game.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:01.520
But not really explaining them.

01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:02.360
That's the thing.

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.600
The standard chess player interview is you sit down

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.120
and you go something about the opening, something about not,

01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.920
oh yeah, I looked at this right before the game.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.640
And then you explain various symphonies

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:15.640
and compositions of variations,

01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.960
things that went through your head,

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.800
things you were evaluating.

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.320
But Hans's interviews are different.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.840
So everything about him as a chess player

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.760
already is different.

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.920
And his interviews are extremely strange

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.120
and also different.

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:27.100
That's fine.

01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:31.860
But not when you combine it then with the world champion

01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:33.660
withdrawing right after you beat him

01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:37.020
and ghosting the entire chess world.

01:47:37.020 --> 01:47:39.540
Yeah, so there's, for people who haven't listened to it,

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:43.460
there's a kind of sloppiness

01:47:43.460 --> 01:47:47.740
to the way he analyzes the game.

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:49.500
Like he's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:51.260
Like it's very-

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:52.100
Because it's very obvious.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:52.940
Like what do you mean?

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:53.860
Just completely winning here.

01:47:53.860 --> 01:47:54.940
Yeah, I'm completely winning here.

01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:58.100
And it's like, yeah, I just play perfect.

01:47:58.100 --> 01:47:58.940
I play perfect.

01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:00.600
Like there's a sense of like,

01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:04.820
but it also doesn't, for me again,

01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:06.300
a very outside spectator,

01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:08.300
it doesn't raise any red flags.

01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:09.820
That's just his personality.

01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.340
He seems to really like to talk this way.

01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:14.260
And plus this could be crazy,

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.700
but do you have a sense that he's more of an intuitive player

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:20.460
versus like he's just not the kind of person

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.260
that analyzes really well?

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:24.760
Or is that a ridiculous notion?

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:26.580
Well, let's put it this way.

01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:30.080
To succeed legitimately,

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.780
because obviously this is a cheating scandal

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:32.740
at the end of the day,

01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:37.100
at the 2750, 82800 level, the upper echelon of chess,

01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:40.180
you cannot be an intuitive player.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:42.380
You can be a little bit more intuitive

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.500
than a calculator and a concrete evaluator of positions.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.960
Meaning if I give you five seconds to play a move,

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.300
you're gonna choose the best move quickly.

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:56.620
Those people are generally better at fast time controls,

01:48:56.620 --> 01:48:58.920
but you have to be good at everything.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:02.300
And what raised red flags in this interview

01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:06.700
was the fact that it was different

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.200
than every other interview any human being ever gave

01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.140
at that level of chess,

01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:12.580
particularly after beating Magnus

01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:14.020
for the first time as a teenager,

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:16.500
which is a very small group of people.

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:19.660
I said, so that's where it got weird.

01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:22.300
And the very next day Magnus withdraws from the event.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:26.840
Chess World lights completely on fire for multiple weeks.

01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:27.680
And-

01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:29.220
He also tweets.

01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.060
Right.

01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:30.900
Yeah, that was-

01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.220
That's the resignation.

01:49:32.220 --> 01:49:33.060
No.

01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:33.880
Resignation-

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:34.720
The tweet was, I'm withdrawing

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:35.740
from the tournament in St. Louis.

01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:38.140
I've always enjoyed playing here and I will in the future.

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.300
And then it's a clip of Jose Mourinho.

01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.340
I cannot speak.

01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.660
I choose not to speak.

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:43.740
If I speak, I'm in big trouble.

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:44.860
I don't wanna be in big trouble.

01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:45.700
Yeah.

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:49.140
And that's some people nuts.

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:51.560
People said it's not even a cheating insinuation,

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.460
which was one of the theories.

01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:55.100
Another theory was someone in team Magnus

01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:58.220
told Hans what Magnus was looking at.

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:01.140
And that's why Hans learned those first 15 moves,

01:50:01.140 --> 01:50:03.460
which is so fucking stupid

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:05.580
because Magnus knows like five people.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.860
Not in his life, but his team is five.

01:50:09.860 --> 01:50:10.940
Yeah, it's very close in that group.

01:50:10.940 --> 01:50:11.780
Right.

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.600
But to the outsider,

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.340
that sounds like a very legitimate theory.

01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.700
How else can you explain?

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:19.100
Hans said he knew before the game what was gonna happen.

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.700
Magnus senses a mole.

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:22.020
He's not, no.

01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:25.340
By the way, just so I know,

01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:27.700
like if that was, forget the cheating aside,

01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:31.980
if you knew, doesn't matter how the opening

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:34.820
your opponent is going to do, they prepared,

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.520
is that a significant help to you?

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:41.140
If that opening is ultra sharp

01:50:41.140 --> 01:50:45.660
and requires basically the game to be on a knife's edge?

01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:46.500
Yeah.

01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.960
Yes, meaning one mistake can be fatal.

01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:51.700
Because then you can look up what the engine says

01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:52.940
and you can-

01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:53.760
Yeah, you can know everything.

01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.600
You can know all the possibilities.

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.860
So even if your opponent goes off that engine path,

01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:58.740
you will know how to punish it.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:02.580
In this case, what happened,

01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:05.240
basically was Magnus played a line

01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:08.060
that if completely optimally punished

01:51:08.060 --> 01:51:10.900
would have given Hans a slightly better position.

01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:12.100
And that's what happened.

01:51:12.100 --> 01:51:14.380
But then he also demolished him

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.980
in that later phase of the game.

01:51:16.580 --> 01:51:21.580
Yes, and then, okay, so Magnus designs goes silent.

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:26.460
The chess world goes crazy.

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:30.100
What else is interesting in that period of time?

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.460
Hans's fourth round game of that tournament

01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:37.820
right after beating Magnus was also just absolutely genius.

01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:41.560
Just an absolutely brilliant game, which he failed to win.

01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:43.640
But then after that game,

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:46.880
he also gives once again another interview

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:49.440
where he's like, this game was absolutely genius.

01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:51.000
I was just killing him from start to finish.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.800
And there was a moment he literally says,

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.760
oh yeah, I just gave him a piece, a full piece,

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.400
which is a substantial advantage to the other side.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.400
And he starts explaining why the position is winning,

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:07.320
but in words, not in chess moves,

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:09.140
not in specific concrete chess moves,

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:10.440
which is the way you're supposed to

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:11.800
if you understand the position, right?

01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:15.860
So now there's this new theory that's being cultivated

01:52:15.860 --> 01:52:19.080
of it's the interviews are gonna be used as the evidence.

01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:21.740
And beyond round four,

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.040
he just played like a good grandmaster

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.580
and he lost two or three games, maybe two games,

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:31.480
and he drew the rest.

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:33.120
So he didn't win again.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.520
Like he beat first two out of his first three games,

01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.780
he beat Mamedyarov, he beat Carlson.

01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.540
And he also went on the attack himself.

01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:44.540
That was when he publicly admitted to cheating

01:52:44.540 --> 01:52:47.260
in an interview that he gave to the St. Louis Chess Club.

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:49.740
That's when he said, he has never cheated over the board.

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:53.180
Then he said, chess.com has banned me

01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.860
from the global championship,

01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.900
which is what I was invited to to play.

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:59.580
Privately they banned me, they didn't even ban me publicly.

01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:04.260
And then he said, and Hikaru is on Twitch every day,

01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.180
saying things about me, this and that.

01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.860
And since then, nothing.

01:53:09.860 --> 01:53:11.660
Tournament finishes somehow.

01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:13.380
I don't know how we got to the end of the tournament.

01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:15.780
I really thought that it was gonna get called off.

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:17.220
But tournament ends,

01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:19.340
Hans hasn't said anything since then.

01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:20.180
So-

01:53:20.180 --> 01:53:22.020
Has he still said, when was the last time you said that?

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:24.900
That was the last tweet that he sent, September 7th.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.060
He said, Hikaru wants to play the victim,

01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:29.180
something like this.

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:32.420
They faced each other again recently.

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:33.820
What was that about?

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:36.180
They played in the online event

01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:39.500
of this Meltwater Champions chess tour,

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:43.540
which is a 16 player tournament

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.340
where everybody plays everybody first.

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:51.060
And after 15 games, the top eight make a knockout bracket.

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:54.820
And Magnus played the game.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.100
There was obviously a lot of hype prior

01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:59.900
for what was gonna happen in this game.

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.860
Magnus plays one move and resigns.

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.460
Actually, I imagine he didn't wanna play one move.

01:54:06.460 --> 01:54:09.180
I imagine he would have resigned the game as it was starting,

01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:11.460
but I think some websites don't let you resign

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:12.740
before you make one move,

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.700
because then the game isn't counted.

01:54:14.700 --> 01:54:16.460
So I think he didn't wanna play at all,

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.300
but he played one move

01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:19.900
and that made it even more epic, I suppose.

01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:20.740
And he resigned.

01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.420
And that was that.

01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:26.020
So you lose, that game counts, right?

01:54:26.020 --> 01:54:26.860
Oh, game counts.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:28.500
You lose the rating.

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:29.940
These online events, unfortunately,

01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:32.940
don't count for any sort of rating.

01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:36.660
But on the tournament, yeah, he played one move, yeah.

01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:37.500
So he resigns.

01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.660
And then how does the tournament still work out?

01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:41.500
Is the tournament already over?

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.820
So he made the eight,

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.340
as Magnus still made the top eight.

01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.020
It was round five, or like round six or something.

01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.740
So it was halfway through the preliminary stage.

01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.100
It affected his standings.

01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:54.540
But then after resigning that game,

01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:58.820
Magnus finished first in the bracket, in the preliminaries,

01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:00.180
and then he won the entire event.

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:03.300
There was a chance that they were gonna meet in the final,

01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:05.580
but Hans lost in the first round

01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:08.580
against the Vietnamese strong player, Le Quang Liem.

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:12.580
And then Magnus gave a short interview

01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:13.660
to the live broadcast

01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:16.020
where he said he would give a statement

01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.540
at the end of the tournament, and then he did.

01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:20.020
He gave a statement at the end of the tournament.

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:21.740
And now here we are.

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:24.780
The only other thing missing from this

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:29.780
is the very intense scrutinization

01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:33.580
of all those over-the-board games that I mentioned earlier

01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:37.700
that Hans dominated in.

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:39.620
So people are now going through all of his games

01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:42.420
that he played in tournaments,

01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:43.900
and they're analyzing them with engines,

01:55:43.900 --> 01:55:45.620
and they're saying he played exceptionally well.

01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:48.100
And the debate is, was he cheating,

01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:51.660
or was he way too good already, but underrated?

01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:54.940
Because he could have had incubated knowledge,

01:55:54.940 --> 01:55:57.020
so he could have not played for a couple of years,

01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:00.340
was 2700 level, but was playing people who were 24, 2500.

01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:05.740
Well, I see, so not just over-the-board

01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:07.740
with the top level people like Magnus,

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.180
but over-the-board in general.

01:56:10.180 --> 01:56:12.940
Yes, before he got a chance to play in these super tournaments

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:14.540
against the best players in the world,

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:15.820
he had to go to Europe.

01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:18.940
He was the most active chess player in 2021.

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:21.540
And he was quite dominant.

01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:23.580
Yes, I think he played more over-the-board games

01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:25.940
than any player in 2021 or 2022.

01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:27.340
I think it's 2021.

01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:32.940
And yes, I think his rise was steeper than everybody,

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:35.540
maybe with the exception of Aldi Reza Ferruja,

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:37.220
who got to 2800.

01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:38.580
See, I'd like to believe,

01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.500
because he talks about being very,

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:43.380
he just became obsessed with chess.

01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.700
I like stories like that.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:51.060
I like stories of the underdog,

01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:53.300
especially with the scarlet letter

01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:56.260
of having been a cheater in the past.

01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:01.260
I like the idea of somebody who is flawed psychologically

01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:07.260
and ethically and just a full, fascinating personality

01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:09.420
and then somehow just becomes obsessed.

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.380
I mean, similar to Bobby Fischer,

01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:14.940
is also a tortured soul, also flawed,

01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.540
also just chaotic all over the place.

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:19.140
You could see Bobby Fischer being somebody

01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:22.780
that might cheat when he was 12 on online chess, right?

01:57:22.780 --> 01:57:23.620
If it existed.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.420
Yeah, actually, I think in some podcasts,

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.740
like small chess podcasts, I don't wanna,

01:57:29.180 --> 01:57:30.580
I like Ben Johnson,

01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:33.580
so I'm apologizing for calling it small,

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:36.780
but compared to like, let's say, Lex Fridman podcast,

01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:37.980
it's-

01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.980
What's his podcast?

01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:41.060
It's Perpetual Chess.

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:41.900
It's kind of like-

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:43.260
Oh, I love Perpetual Chess.

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:44.340
Are you joking?

01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:45.180
Really?

01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.020
How dare you copy?

01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:49.660
Yeah, wait, all right, I'll show you.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.580
Because it does a lot of, it talks,

01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:53.820
it makes me feel special.

01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:54.780
Let me see, where is it?

01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.940
Perpetual Chess.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.820
He does like, Improver Series.

01:57:58.820 --> 01:57:59.660
Yes.

01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:00.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:01.340
Yes, yes.

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.420
Yeah, he's great, Ben, I forgot,

01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.380
I'm so horrible at names.

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:04.780
His name is Ben, Ben Johnson?

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:07.180
Yeah, it is Ben Johnson, that's right.

01:58:07.180 --> 01:58:08.860
Yeah, the Perpetual Chess podcast.

01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:09.700
That's amazing.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.820
See, Lex, when, even individuals like myself

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:14.940
who might have a large audience,

01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.900
when I look at you, you're at a,

01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:17.900
you're just at a different level.

01:58:17.900 --> 01:58:20.860
I don't expect you to be listening to Chess podcast

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.700
during the day.

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:22.660
Just imagine you're generally doing something

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:26.060
to change the world or talking to some visionary people.

01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.780
Well, I should say, I've been running a lot

01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:33.220
and I listen to podcasts a lot because they're such,

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:38.060
I love human beings excited about stuff

01:58:38.060 --> 01:58:39.180
that really energizes me.

01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:42.660
And I've listened to a bunch of Chess podcasts.

01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:46.300
I'm really energized by your love of chess.

01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:48.340
I really like, yeah, sorry, I forgot his name,

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.580
but Ben Johnson, I love it when he talks to grandmasters,

01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:55.580
I love it when he talks to the regular folks

01:58:55.780 --> 01:59:00.220
for the improvers, like to see how they balance life

01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:01.940
in chess and all that kind of stuff.

01:59:01.940 --> 01:59:02.780
He's just pretty good at it.

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:04.340
And he's like super excited.

01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:05.900
And they talk about books.

01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:06.740
Yeah.

01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:07.580
And they get excited about different books.

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:08.420
Yes.

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:13.420
I mean, it also gives me a sense of where the chess world is.

01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:17.900
From a different perspective,

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:20.580
it's like people studying chess,

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.620
like what they get excited about, how difficult it is.

01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:26.900
Yeah, it's nice to get a sense of the community,

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:28.340
the language that's used,

01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:30.940
because I did wanna have a bunch of conversations

01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:33.580
with folks about chess,

01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.860
because I think it's a beautiful game

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:36.700
and I think it's a beautiful community.

01:59:36.700 --> 01:59:38.980
So that's one of the podcasts I listen to.

01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:40.580
So yeah, anyway, it's great.

01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:42.820
Anyway, you were saying, why did you bring him up?

01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:43.660
Yes.

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:44.500
Great podcast.

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.340
Great podcast.

01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:48.100
Only reason I thought of it,

01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:50.860
and I use the word small, no disrespect, Ben,

01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:54.940
is because even that episode, which he did with Hans,

01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:56.060
like it was a small episode.

01:59:56.060 --> 01:59:59.540
It wasn't seen by mass audience of chess.

01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:01.140
He did an episode with Hans recently?

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:01.980
I know.

02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:02.860
Some time ago, yeah.

02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:04.700
And in that episode, Hans very openly is like,

02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:07.860
Bobby Fischer was misunderstood and he was my idol.

02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:08.700
Oh wow.

02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:09.540
Said a couple of things like that.

02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:12.660
And Hans is an intense guy.

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:14.660
When I listen to Hans, I get a little anxious.

02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:18.820
He brings out some sort of disturbance in my ecosystem.

02:00:18.820 --> 02:00:19.660
Yeah.

02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:24.180
Yeah, I can't really pin him down to what's going on there

02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:25.900
as a person who's trying to read people.

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:26.740
Yeah.

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.220
This is the dark aspect.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.740
He could be both the genius of Bobby Fischer

02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:36.140
and a genius cheater.

02:00:36.140 --> 02:00:39.140
And you could see there's something chaotic about him

02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:41.340
which makes him very appealing in that way.

02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:42.180
Yes.

02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:45.980
So right now, late September, 2022,

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:50.980
the current environment is such that Hans hasn't said

02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:56.500
anything in weeks and people are sort of dissecting

02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:03.100
every bit of circumstantial evidence that they can.

02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:05.700
And they're trying to present the case.

02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:08.420
I don't even know to who, ultimately.

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:10.740
I guess it would be the FIDE cheating,

02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:12.900
anti-cheating commission or whatever.

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:14.460
It might be to you, essentially.

02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:15.300
I mean.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:16.140
To people with the platform.

02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:16.980
It could be.

02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:21.940
To present convincing evidence to where the people

02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:23.740
are convinced that one way or the other.

02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:25.140
Because for people who don't know,

02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.100
and they should definitely follow Gotham Chess,

02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:29.820
you've been on this, you've covered it a lot.

02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:32.380
And I'm sure if anything comes out, you'll cover it more.

02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.420
But you've been quite balanced and thoughtful

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.180
and kind of objective about the whole thing.

02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:37.020
Yeah.

02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:42.020
So the reason for that is, I understand the power

02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:48.020
that I wield with anything and if I say one sentence

02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:53.300
the wrong way, I might be sending 10,000 people

02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:55.060
or more to go do something.

02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:56.300
Yeah.

02:01:56.300 --> 02:01:57.140
And I hate that.

02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:59.860
I want to present the evidence and I want the video

02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:02.740
to end and people go, okay, I understand.

02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:06.820
Not, I'm gonna go fuck someone up, you know what I mean?

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:11.660
And I also believe that even if Hans,

02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:17.340
even if Hans is guilty, this goes all the way back.

02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:18.980
He's a human being.

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:20.020
Yeah.

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:24.340
And you can argue that cheaters gotta be punished

02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:27.460
and you can argue that people who do things wrong,

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:29.980
you shouldn't feel any sort of compassion.

02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:31.540
But I would hate to have the whole world

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.100
pointing their fingers at me,

02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:35.540
the entire world that I've known my entire life.

02:02:35.700 --> 02:02:40.700
And even if I messed up, there's still a world after chess.

02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.780
There might still even be a world in chess.

02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:47.780
I don't know, but that stuff, it doesn't make me feel good

02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:52.380
to present all of the circumstantial evidence in my videos

02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:55.580
and start being like, yeah, it looks, you know, so.

02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:57.860
But at the same time, you deeply care about chess

02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:02.180
and the chess community and there's some sense where,

02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.180
was it you or was it Magnus that said

02:03:04.180 --> 02:03:07.220
that cheating poses an existential threat?

02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:08.300
Magnus said that.

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:10.220
I mean, there is some aspect of truth to that,

02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:13.940
which is like, you know, the chess is in a state

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.780
where bots, chess engines are much better than humans.

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:20.980
And we're living in a world where technology

02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:24.620
becomes easier and easier to integrate with human beings,

02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:27.500
whether you put it in some office or elsewhere.

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:32.500
And that does pose a threat to our ability to trust

02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:35.500
that a world champion is indeed a world champion,

02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:38.700
that somebody we think is good is indeed good.

02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:42.420
And so there is some aspect to the ecosystem

02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:45.100
that should punish cheating

02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:47.060
and perhaps over-punish cheating.

02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:51.700
And the other thing is, in sport, you can take PEDs

02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:56.060
and have bigger muscles, better reaction time,

02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:00.060
but you still have to perform the action

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:01.300
in a successful way.

02:04:01.340 --> 02:04:05.660
There is still a chance you can lose if you take PEDs.

02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:08.620
Maybe in some sports, the gap between non-PED

02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:11.460
and PED user is significantly more noticeable,

02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:16.460
but in chess, if you cheat, you play God.

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:21.860
Yeah, you decide when the game is over.

02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:24.500
You can fake bad moves.

02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:25.700
You can fake everything.

02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:28.020
You can even, if you're cheating,

02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:29.100
quote unquote, the right way,

02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.220
you're gonna lose plenty of games.

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.980
So to avoid getting detected.

02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:37.820
So you can create bots that are 2,800.

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:39.700
You can also just not listen.

02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.020
If you know all the best moves,

02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:42.060
but choose to play on your own,

02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:43.820
and, oh, I made a mistake, not a big deal.

02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:47.020
You could, yes, bots are all at a different level.

02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:52.020
But if you were to cheat, that you play God.

02:04:52.300 --> 02:04:55.020
You can decide when you make your move

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:56.340
and when the engine makes its move.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.340
And if you know the top four lines of the engine,

02:04:58.340 --> 02:04:59.380
you choose the fourth one.

02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.060
In hindsight, people will analyze your game

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.700
and they will go, oh, it wasn't perfect.

02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:05.580
Well, no shit, only the stupid cheaters

02:05:05.580 --> 02:05:07.380
play the top engine line the whole game.

02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:08.420
By the way, I'm not saying

02:05:08.420 --> 02:05:11.100
that this is what's happening here,

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:16.100
but there's probably an excitement

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:21.020
to playing God and getting away with it.

02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:23.500
Like I know people, I know adults,

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:28.500
grown adults who are successful in their fields,

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:31.660
and they cheat, they cheat in lessons,

02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:34.300
they cheat in, like I've,

02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:35.700
I don't wanna say I've taught any.

02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:37.820
May I, may or may not have.

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.260
For some reason, one of them watches this

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:40.980
and they know they're guilty.

02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:42.660
And it happens, it happens.

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.860
Not just teenagers, not just young adults,

02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:47.620
but full grown adults will cheat when they play

02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:49.860
because I think it helps them learn.

02:05:49.860 --> 02:05:52.620
Oh, well, that's exactly just that justification.

02:05:52.620 --> 02:05:56.540
But I just meant like, it might not be just about winning.

02:05:56.580 --> 02:06:00.060
It might also just feel good to have that power.

02:06:00.060 --> 02:06:01.220
Power?

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:03.220
Like, I bet you it's a drug.

02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:04.380
Oh, yeah.

02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:06.300
I mean, like with a lot of criminals,

02:06:07.900 --> 02:06:10.220
with a lot of criminals, I feel like part of,

02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.340
like the mass murderers, serial killers,

02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:15.860
I feel like a lot of it is they can get away with it.

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:20.100
The fact that they, like everyone else is a sucker

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.300
and they figured out how to do this evil thing.

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:26.300
And obviously cheating isn't nowhere close to that,

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:30.380
but there's still a feeling of getting away with it.

02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:32.140
Yeah, I wonder.

02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:33.820
I mean, you're pretty objective on the whole thing.

02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:38.180
Where, if you were a betting man,

02:06:38.180 --> 02:06:40.820
what would you say is the probability?

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:42.580
Are you changing day by day in your head?

02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:44.700
What's the probability that Hans cheated

02:06:46.580 --> 02:06:50.340
over the board against Magnus in St. Louis?

02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.020
That's a tough one, man.

02:06:53.020 --> 02:06:56.980
Have you even allowed yourself to put a probability on it?

02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:58.940
No, not on that specific game,

02:06:58.940 --> 02:07:01.700
because I think a lot of that game

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:05.140
was affected by Magnus' own psyche.

02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:07.300
That was one of his worst games ever.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:08.580
So he played poorly, too.

02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:09.420
Magnus played poorly.

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:11.140
Which doesn't help his case.

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:14.540
Hans might have cheated in that game, but we'll never know.

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:19.740
I think day by day,

02:07:20.860 --> 02:07:25.020
the evidence is slowly starting to show more and more

02:07:25.020 --> 02:07:29.540
that he's cheated, like how Magnus said,

02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:32.460
more than he said and more recently.

02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:33.820
It's undeniable.

02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:36.140
A lot of the statistics are there.

02:07:36.140 --> 02:07:40.900
The problem is you can't prove you're not cheating.

02:07:40.900 --> 02:07:42.980
Unless you strip naked,

02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.220
like that site offered him a million bucks to.

02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.060
Everything about the-

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.900
Wait, which site offered him a million bucks?

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:50.740
I saw some headline that said

02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:51.580
Hans Nieman was offered a million bucks.

02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:53.420
That can't be real.

02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:56.340
And where I struggle to comprehend is

02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.820
how on earth he could pull it off.

02:07:58.820 --> 02:08:03.820
And I'm a guilty, my brain goes to guilt first.

02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:07.460
Yeah, resentment, remorse, guilt, that kind of,

02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.300
that trio.

02:08:08.820 --> 02:08:12.340
Magnus put out a statement as we speak yesterday,

02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:15.980
saying, Dear Chess World, at the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:18.100
I made the unprecedented professional decision

02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:21.020
to withdraw from the tournament after my round three game

02:08:21.020 --> 02:08:22.140
against Hans Nieman.

02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:25.900
A week later, during the Champions Chess Tour,

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.140
I resigned against Hans Nieman

02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:29.740
after playing only one move.

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:32.500
I know that my actions have frustrated many

02:08:32.500 --> 02:08:33.820
in the chess community.

02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:34.900
I'm frustrated.

02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.460
I want to play chess again.

02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.700
I'm frustrated.

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.820
I want to play chess.

02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:40.980
I want to continue to play chess at the highest level

02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:42.300
in the best events.

02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:45.660
I believe that cheating in chess is a big deal

02:08:45.660 --> 02:08:48.300
and an existential threat to the game.

02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:50.740
I also believe that chess organizers

02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:53.620
and all those who care about the sanctity of the game

02:08:53.620 --> 02:08:56.940
we love should seriously consider increasing security measures

02:08:56.940 --> 02:09:00.340
and methods of cheat detection for over-the-board chess.

02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:03.020
When Nieman was invited last minute

02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:05.100
to the 2022 Sinkfield Cup,

02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:08.300
I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event

02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:09.660
I ultimately chose to play.

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:10.820
That's the thing you're referring to,

02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:15.220
is that now we know he was torn about the whole thing.

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:19.060
I believe that Nieman has cheated more and more recently

02:09:19.060 --> 02:09:20.740
than he has publicly admitted.

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:24.380
His over-the-board progress has been unusual

02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:27.100
and throughout our game in Sinkfield Cup,

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:30.020
I had the impression that he wasn't tense

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.860
or even fully concentrating on the game

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:33.140
in critical positions,

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.340
while outplaying me as black in a way

02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:38.140
I think only a handful of players can do.

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.260
This game contributed to changing my perspective.

02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:45.340
We must do something about cheating.

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:47.220
And for my part, going forward,

02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:49.500
I don't want to play against people

02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:51.540
that have cheated repeatedly in the past

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:54.460
because I don't know what they're capable of doing

02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:55.460
in the future.

02:09:55.460 --> 02:09:59.060
There's more than I would like to say, unfortunately.

02:09:59.060 --> 02:10:01.220
At this time, I'm limited in what I can say

02:10:01.220 --> 02:10:04.180
without explicit permission from Nieman to speak openly.

02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:08.740
So far, I have only been able to speak with my actions

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:10.940
and those actions have stated clearly

02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:13.620
that I am not willing to play chess with Nieman.

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:16.340
I hope that the truth in this matter comes out,

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:17.460
whatever it may be.

02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:21.660
Sincerely, Magnus Carlsen, world chess champion.

02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:25.260
How would you sign off your statements?

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:26.180
If I was a world...

02:10:26.180 --> 02:10:27.580
No, just say whatever.

02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:29.780
Lex Fridman, what would be the title?

02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.620
Yeah, I don't know.

02:10:31.020 --> 02:10:34.500
I think I would not, even if I was a world champion,

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.660
I would just say Lex.

02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:38.900
Or make up a title.

02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:42.060
And I feel like I really fucked up in life

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:45.900
if I have to tweet a statement as an image.

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:49.260
That's like when you get, you're a politician

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:51.700
and you got caught cheating on your wife,

02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:54.660
like for many years in a row.

02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.660
Then I tweet an image.

02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:59.380
I'm sorry for all the people I have hurt

02:10:59.460 --> 02:11:03.500
and the people that believed in me and whatever else.

02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.700
And then I would sign world chess champion.

02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.540
You know the most, like the modern way to give a statement,

02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:10.540
what I thought Magnus was gonna do.

02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:11.780
Thought he was gonna write,

02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:16.940
on the recent scandal

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:20.260
or my statement on the past few weeks, tweet longer.

02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:23.140
What do you mean?

02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:24.700
So you put a URL.

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:25.540
Oh yeah.

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:27.940
So that's for tweets, but it's unlimited characters.

02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:28.780
It's not 140.

02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:29.780
I don't know what that is.

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:30.620
Can you explain that to me?

02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:32.660
Yeah, so generally when a celebrity

02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:34.460
has a giant audience on Twitter,

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:37.580
they will make their statement on social media

02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:40.900
and say what it is in a sentence, one line,

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:42.220
and then there's a link.

02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:43.380
Where does that link take you?

02:11:43.380 --> 02:11:45.540
To a website called tweet longer.

02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:46.380
Oh, that's a natural website.

02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:47.620
Like tweet longer, tweet longer, yeah.

02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:49.220
And that is where they write their statements.

02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:50.500
That is what I was expecting.

02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.340
Who did this?

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:52.500
I haven't seen this before.

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.980
Oh, this is, I don't have one off the top of my head,

02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:55.820
but this is.

02:11:55.820 --> 02:11:57.220
This is like Kanye Kim Kardashian breaking up

02:11:57.220 --> 02:11:58.060
that would use that.

02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:00.300
Streamers, musicians, yeah.

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:01.700
I don't think politicians use it

02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.420
because it's just feeling.

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.940
Yeah, they use the image.

02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:07.220
They use Myspace and Facebook, right?

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:09.620
Yeah.

02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.300
I would probably go, I like,

02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.340
I'm not just being biased here

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:17.900
just because I have a podcast.

02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:19.500
I'm a huge fan of podcasts.

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:22.420
I feel like I would go on a podcast to talk about it

02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:23.340
with somebody I trust.

02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:25.380
So like long form and discuss it.

02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:26.980
Thought I was gonna do that too.

02:12:27.060 --> 02:12:29.660
In fact, I wanted to write him a message

02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:34.340
and be like, I can be that guy for you.

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:37.660
I have a very strange relationship with Magnus because.

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:38.780
Good, bad.

02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.620
I don't, we've never interacted.

02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:44.900
I very openly,

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:48.860
I don't wanna say use him for views

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:51.340
because that is a very crude way of saying it.

02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:53.460
But if you wanted to insult my YouTube channel,

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:55.380
that is what you would say.

02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:57.660
Oh, Magnus is in a lot of videos?

02:12:57.660 --> 02:12:59.420
Thumbnails or videos.

02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:02.420
Not clickbaity, but if he's playing in a tournament

02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:03.900
and he plays a great game,

02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:06.300
he's going on that fucking thumbnail.

02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:10.540
Oh, because let's see, he's the number one chess player.

02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:12.940
Very likely the greatest chess player of all time.

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:14.300
Plus he's exciting.

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:17.220
And YouTube algorithm loves his name

02:13:17.220 --> 02:13:18.580
and people click on it.

02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:19.420
Oh, do they?

02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:20.660
The best.

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:24.060
Yeah, but I don't know what the chicken or the egg is,

02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:26.740
but the reason it loves it,

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:27.740
the reason people click on it

02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:29.780
is because he is an exciting personality.

02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:31.780
He's an exciting chess player.

02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:34.300
Is there something compelling about him?

02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:35.140
Yeah.

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:36.820
He's also, he knows how to,

02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:40.580
in a subtle, dry, wit, humor way, talk shit

02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:44.020
with the silences and all of that.

02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:44.860
Yes.

02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.380
He knows it, he knows it, he knows the whole game of it.

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:49.660
Specifically to Magnus, my relationship with him,

02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:52.420
we've never interacted and throughout the last couple

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:56.260
of years, he generally has interacted with Hikaru

02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:57.860
as a competitor.

02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:01.020
He has done some collabs with the Botezes.

02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:03.900
He obviously has talked to Ludwig,

02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.980
who's a very, very big streamer.

02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:09.420
And part of me regrets the fact that

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:14.940
when I was smaller as a YouTuber and a Twitch streamer,

02:14:14.940 --> 02:14:19.940
I'm sure I used to make jokes or some tweets at Magnus.

02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.620
Like when Magnus would tweet something,

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.820
I would try to respond so I could be the top reply

02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:24.860
because that was my social media.

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:26.780
I literally think, I once responded to a Magnus tweet

02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:28.540
and saying, responding for engagement.

02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:30.580
Because it was some, like, it wasn't some controversial

02:14:30.580 --> 02:14:33.020
tweet, it was just something funny.

02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:35.300
And I went, ha ha, responding for engagement.

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:38.020
Because I was just being a little bit of an idiot

02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:40.860
and I knew that if it got enough likes,

02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:43.100
it would be at the top and people would see me, my brand

02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:44.180
and just get to know me.

02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:45.020
This is the type of-

02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:46.580
Please don't use the word brand, but yes.

02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:47.420
Yes.

02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:51.380
But yeah, no, and your worry is that

02:14:51.380 --> 02:14:52.620
he wouldn't take you seriously.

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:53.460
He wouldn't take me seriously.

02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:57.140
And if I was one of the best of all time

02:14:57.140 --> 02:15:00.780
and I saw some dude on YouTube just kind of being a moron

02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:02.060
and I'm all over his thumbnails,

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.260
I can imagine he has a very legitimate case.

02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:06.540
I appreciate your humility and self-critical nature,

02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:11.540
but one of the realities with people like him

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:17.060
is he wouldn't hold a grudge or not treat you seriously.

02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:24.180
I'm pretty sure he's a fan, he's a big supporter.

02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:26.900
He doesn't watch YouTube videos of that kind.

02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:28.060
I barely watch YouTube videos.

02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:29.540
I think of chess.

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:33.700
He might watch more fun chess adjacent stuff,

02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:36.300
but he just doesn't, it's not for him.

02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.620
So I'm pretty sure he knows of you and likes you

02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:43.220
and you're commenting on stuff has zero effect

02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.980
on his belief, which is funny.

02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.340
That's something you think about.

02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:49.660
Now you're perfect, but you're well-respected.

02:15:49.660 --> 02:15:52.340
Like you're, a lot of people mention you as a person

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.660
who was like, okay, this person is legit,

02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:55.700
which is an important thing.

02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:57.580
It's not just an entertainer.

02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:00.300
It's not just a shit talker and so on.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:02.500
This person is a great educator,

02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:05.820
a great fan and student of chess,

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:08.500
a great player himself, so all of those components.

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:10.580
So yeah, you're definitely a good person.

02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:13.780
And on this particular aspect have been very objective.

02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:17.420
I understand that I'm nowhere near perfect.

02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:19.900
I'm not a different person on camera or off camera.

02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:23.980
I will say it like it is, maybe on Twitch.

02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:26.020
You gotta dig in the mud there a little bit more,

02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:28.420
a lot more sarcastic, a lot more brash and whatnot,

02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:32.220
but you meet me in a taco place

02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:34.660
and I'll talk with you the same way I might

02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:38.020
if it was a video, just that you may not,

02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:40.380
you may not consider me just a random guy at a taco place.

02:16:40.380 --> 02:16:43.620
And that's why I think about the stuff specific to Magnus

02:16:43.620 --> 02:16:46.300
and it's one of the reasons I don't reach out

02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:47.940
to him directly ever.

02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:49.700
I never have, I've never DM'd him on Instagram

02:16:49.700 --> 02:16:51.420
hoping for a response, never.

02:16:51.420 --> 02:16:53.940
I've never even reached out to anyone on his team

02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:57.340
trying to get a conversation very candid with him,

02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:59.100
which I think it would be.

02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:02.540
I even barely reached out to guys in the top 10,

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:03.380
like top 15.

02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:06.580
I only recently started pushing myself more to do that.

02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:10.500
And I, even in my intro messages to them,

02:17:10.500 --> 02:17:12.540
preemptively say something like,

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:14.340
you might think I'm some idiot,

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:16.380
you might not be totally wrong.

02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:17.220
Yes.

02:17:17.220 --> 02:17:19.780
But like, I think this would be a good conversation

02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:20.620
and give it a shot.

02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:23.100
And I've been surprised, I've been ignored by a few,

02:17:23.100 --> 02:17:24.780
but some said, oh yeah, I've seen your stuff.

02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:27.020
I'm generally a fan, like no problem.

02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:28.820
I was actually really blown away.

02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:31.620
This YouTube channel, Levitov Chess,

02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:33.380
it's a Russian chess channel.

02:17:33.380 --> 02:17:36.060
And I think the last name of the guy is,

02:17:36.060 --> 02:17:38.020
the name of the channel is named after Ilya Levitov,

02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:40.300
who has some sort of managerial role

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:41.900
in the Russian chess federation.

02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:44.620
And this channel has interviewed

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.900
some of the greatest players of all time.

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:49.940
They have interviews with the modern best Russian players

02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:52.060
and Kasparov, Karpov, Kramnik,

02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:54.820
you name these guys from Russian chess.

02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.460
History, it's unbelievable.

02:17:56.460 --> 02:17:57.740
I just thought this was a channel

02:17:57.740 --> 02:18:02.140
of just unbelievably well-respected chess players

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:05.860
and legion of fans that were longtime chess fans.

02:18:06.540 --> 02:18:10.060
I mentioned them very briefly in a YouTube video

02:18:10.060 --> 02:18:15.060
and that little clip went into their next community event.

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:18.540
And the founder of the channel went on this two minute

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:22.340
beautiful description of why he liked me

02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.540
and how he only watched my channel as a beginner

02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:26.700
and how I have a natural voice

02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:28.100
and how if I talked about cards,

02:18:28.100 --> 02:18:30.300
I would have a million, a hundred million subscribers.

02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:33.980
Just all this really kind stuff that in my mind,

02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:35.700
I thought was either undeserved

02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:38.100
or I just never fathomed that.

02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:41.740
Yeah, I mean, you certainly should not feel as deserved

02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:44.380
as you should have a humility about that kind of stuff.

02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:47.220
But I think that is the thing that works over time.

02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:48.740
It's like reputation spreads,

02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:51.820
which is like if one person likes you

02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:53.420
and they tell you to other people

02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:56.100
and it kind of spreads and over time,

02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:58.300
you have one conversation with the top 10,

02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:01.300
like a super grand master

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:02.900
and they say nice things about you

02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:04.220
and it just kind of spreads.

02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:07.380
Because I've been very surprised in all walks of life.

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:15.540
This really gets me, this makes me happy, honestly,

02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:19.820
because people ask me how I get guests and so on.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:23.140
And it just seems honestly, just be a good person

02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:27.460
and like a real person and honest

02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:30.100
and it just kind of spreads the word word of mouth.

02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:34.380
You know, even coming here, I almost didn't reach out.

02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:36.180
What do you mean?

02:19:36.180 --> 02:19:39.060
I had seen you had never talked to a chess person

02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:40.740
and I've watched a lot of,

02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:42.140
I've watched some of the things start to finish,

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.860
especially if the guest I'm really interested in,

02:19:43.860 --> 02:19:46.380
like George St. Pierre, I'll watch that guy do whatever.

02:19:46.380 --> 02:19:47.220
Yeah, exactly.

02:19:47.220 --> 02:19:48.820
I'll watch him do basically anything,

02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:49.820
make an omelet or something.

02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:51.380
Yeah, I love listening to him.

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:54.020
Some of the other things I've listened to as well.

02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:58.140
And I noticed that neither, well, to me,

02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:01.940
you obviously and Joe are the two biggest podcasters.

02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:03.180
I don't know if that's like factual.

02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:05.180
I don't know if some influencer has some podcasts,

02:20:05.180 --> 02:20:07.940
but you guys interview folks that I listen to

02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:11.140
more often than anybody else.

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:12.860
And when Magnus came on, I was like,

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:14.500
oh, this is, that's amazing.

02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:17.460
You know, I don't even know how I would reach out

02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:18.300
to someone like you.

02:20:18.300 --> 02:20:21.740
It just seems like climbing a mountain.

02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:23.060
And then a couple of days later,

02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:25.460
and I even in that episode wanted to write,

02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:26.420
but I didn't know how.

02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.940
It's like, do I make a YouTube comment?

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:29.580
I don't want that.

02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:30.860
I'm looking like I'm clout chasing on the Magnus episode.

02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:32.660
But then you talked to Botezes and I said,

02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.380
oh, what's this?

02:20:34.380 --> 02:20:35.580
I shouldn't overthink it.

02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.420
Yeah.

02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:39.060
Like, you know, I, so I just said, all right, fuck it.

02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:40.500
I'll just write a comment.

02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:41.700
And you're like, yeah, I'd love to have you on.

02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.700
I was shocked.

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:45.180
I didn't even, you responded just within

02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:46.420
a couple hours or something.

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:47.900
Yeah, yeah, I loved it, man.

02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:49.260
I mean, it was an honor.

02:20:49.260 --> 02:20:50.420
It's a good way to connect.

02:20:50.420 --> 02:20:52.420
I also like on live streams.

02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:54.900
I'll watch, I try to resist commenting,

02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:59.900
but, you know, I'll watch some even smaller channels.

02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:02.260
Like, I'll get super excited by them

02:21:02.260 --> 02:21:03.580
and connect in that way.

02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:05.100
There's an intimacy to that.

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:06.340
Man, YouTube is beautiful.

02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:08.380
I don't know anything about Twitch.

02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:09.220
Maybe it's similar.

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:10.660
You don't need to know anything about it.

02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:12.020
But YouTube has.

02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:13.500
Ruin you.

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:14.860
There is an intimacy.

02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:16.660
Like, especially if it's live.

02:21:16.660 --> 02:21:19.340
I don't know what that is, but if it's live,

02:21:19.340 --> 02:21:21.420
they're like right there.

02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:24.140
You can just like reach out and say hello.

02:21:24.220 --> 02:21:25.060
That's cool.

02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:26.620
It's like really, I don't know.

02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:29.740
I'm just happy to live in this time

02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:31.500
when you can connect with people in that way.

02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.420
There is an intimacy.

02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:34.340
That's why I love podcasts, too.

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:38.140
I listen to people and I feel like they're my friend.

02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:38.980
It's cool.

02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:40.660
It's a cool feeling.

02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:44.260
It makes you feel less lonely in this world.

02:21:44.260 --> 02:21:46.100
Like, you have a lifelong companion,

02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:47.620
especially like people that do a podcast

02:21:47.620 --> 02:21:49.140
for many, many years.

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:51.220
I'm like, we've been, you've gone through

02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:53.420
all the ups and downs of life together

02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:56.540
with a creator, with a podcaster, with anything.

02:21:56.540 --> 02:21:57.540
It's cool.

02:21:57.540 --> 02:21:58.500
I don't know.

02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:01.420
It makes, it's surprisingly intimate,

02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:02.580
a one-way friendships.

02:22:03.900 --> 02:22:05.380
Maybe for an introvert, I don't know.

02:22:05.380 --> 02:22:10.380
There's some negatives that people definitely describe.

02:22:11.740 --> 02:22:13.980
The word that gets used a lot is parasocial.

02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:16.180
You think you, like the viewer will think

02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:20.100
that the streamer or the YouTuber knows them

02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:22.260
or owes them something or has some,

02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:25.140
they have a bigger connection than they do.

02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:25.980
But you know what?

02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.340
Actually, because I had to interrupt,

02:22:27.340 --> 02:22:28.980
I have to look, maybe you can explain to me.

02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:31.020
I've heard this term parasocial a lot.

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.500
I'm meaning to look it up.

02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:36.100
Might as well look it up while in live podcast.

02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:36.940
Sure, sure.

02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:39.420
Parasocial interaction, PSI, refers,

02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:40.540
is this a new term?

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:41.940
Because I have just started listening,

02:22:41.940 --> 02:22:44.940
hearing it like the last year or so.

02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:45.980
Yeah.

02:22:45.980 --> 02:22:47.980
Parasocial interaction, PSI, refers to

02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:50.140
kind of psychological relationship experienced

02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:53.460
by an audience in their mediated encounters

02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:55.220
with performance in the mass media,

02:22:55.220 --> 02:22:58.740
particularly on television and on online platforms.

02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:00.780
Viewers or listeners come to consider

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.820
media personalities as friends,

02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.260
despite having no or limited interaction with,

02:23:05.260 --> 02:23:06.980
oh shit, that's a term for a thing

02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:11.260
I've been referring to, interesting.

02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:13.340
The term was coined by Donald Horton

02:23:13.340 --> 02:23:15.940
and Richard Wall in 1956.

02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:16.780
Wow.

02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:19.380
When there was like very limited media, huh?

02:23:19.380 --> 02:23:20.540
Wow.

02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:23.220
I guess TV and radio and stuff, yeah, yeah.

02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:25.460
Parasocial interaction and exposure

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:27.420
that gamers interested in persona

02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:29.060
become parasocial relationship

02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.860
after repeated exposure to the media.

02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:32.980
Yeah, okay, what's the downside, bro?

02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:34.100
What's, okay.

02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:35.500
Oh, well, I can tell you the downside.

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:37.460
The downside is people thinking

02:23:37.460 --> 02:23:39.540
they're in relationships with streamers

02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:40.700
and stalking them.

02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:41.540
That's-

02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:42.380
Oh, the stalking part.

02:23:42.380 --> 02:23:44.180
But the relationship is like,

02:23:45.540 --> 02:23:48.060
I mean, okay, you mean like actual relationship.

02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:51.340
Like waking up and saying,

02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:52.180
how are you doing?

02:23:52.180 --> 02:23:53.380
Like in your head to them.

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:56.700
Yeah, no, but that might be an extension.

02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:59.660
More like, yeah, getting mad,

02:23:59.660 --> 02:24:01.140
they don't respond to you

02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:04.700
in anytime you're in the stream

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:07.700
or that convincing yourself

02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:09.020
the other person wants you

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:11.860
and you need to go to them

02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:14.140
so you need to find where they are.

02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:15.620
Like this has happened.

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:17.540
Some of the biggest female streamers

02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:20.260
have reported that they get stalked

02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:21.820
and harassed for months

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:23.820
and that's born out of this.

02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:26.500
This on a very small scale is

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:29.500
you come into a stream every so often

02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:32.020
and give an update about your academic career.

02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:33.060
That's not so bad.

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:34.740
I was gonna mention,

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:36.340
I've streamed on Twitch for years

02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.940
and I watched people have kids.

02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:41.180
Like people will come in over the course of months

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:42.340
and say, hey man, you know,

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.540
I just finished, I just took the bar exam.

02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:46.780
Yo man, like I'm having my first kid

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:49.180
and that's crazy, that's amazing.

02:24:49.180 --> 02:24:52.260
But if they do it in a healthy way, that's one thing.

02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:54.540
But I-

02:24:54.540 --> 02:24:56.620
Oh, there's always gonna be downsides

02:24:56.620 --> 02:24:58.220
but most of it is beautiful, man.

02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:03.220
I have very, I have, I guess,

02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:06.940
parasocial relationships of people

02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:10.340
that take it a little too far, but it's all love.

02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:12.220
You also have a fundamental belief

02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:14.100
and hope in people to be good.

02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:16.020
Yeah, yeah.

02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:19.300
And I haven't gotten in trouble with it yet.

02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:21.980
That's a good thing, me too.

02:25:21.980 --> 02:25:24.020
I've interacted with plenty of people in person

02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:26.020
and no one's been negative, so it's-

02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:28.140
And I've even gone to a war zone.

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:30.140
I can't.

02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:32.260
There's no, there hasn't been,

02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:35.740
people have been very, I don't know,

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:40.540
people have only surprised me in the positive direction

02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:44.020
in the depth of the capacity they have for compassion.

02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:48.460
Did we, okay, so now we're in this weird place

02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:49.420
with the cheating.

02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.340
Can I ask you a question about how it's possible to cheat?

02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:57.300
Like if you and I, you know,

02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:58.860
the conversation you're gonna have with Magnus,

02:25:58.860 --> 02:26:00.380
we're gonna play chess.

02:26:00.380 --> 02:26:02.820
If we're trying to figure out how can you beat him,

02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:05.940
what are the different ways, do you think?

02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:08.100
Over the board chess, what are the ways to cheat?

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.220
Yeah.

02:26:09.260 --> 02:26:14.220
That's where I lose the thread because I don't know.

02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:16.060
That's what I immediately want to,

02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:18.420
is like the engineering challenge of cheating.

02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:20.780
Right, well that's because that's,

02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:21.780
that's because you're good at that.

02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:24.180
I mean, you're not good at creating cheating

02:26:24.180 --> 02:26:25.140
in over the board situations.

02:26:25.140 --> 02:26:27.100
I'm just saying your brain works differently.

02:26:27.100 --> 02:26:30.300
I just choose to not even, like I can't entertain that.

02:26:30.300 --> 02:26:31.820
I can come up with some bullshit,

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:33.260
but it's not gonna be anywhere-

02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:36.140
Oh, your mind is not like immediately attracted

02:26:36.140 --> 02:26:37.740
to pulling at that thread of like,

02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:39.580
how would you fuck with the system?

02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:41.260
Yeah, my mind stops at,

02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:43.780
ha, that would have to be a really sophisticated thing

02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:44.620
and that's it.

02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:46.140
It doesn't go any further.

02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:48.260
My brain every day thinks about the best way

02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:51.300
to compartmentalize chess into a digestible format

02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:53.740
and put it out into content.

02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.260
Chess on the board, chess, not cheating.

02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:00.500
Yeah, I just think about YouTube.

02:27:00.500 --> 02:27:01.380
I just think about that.

02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:03.340
That's currently where my mind is fully focused.

02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.860
I'm also working on like a book, so.

02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:06.700
So that's what you think.

02:27:06.700 --> 02:27:07.540
Yes.

02:27:07.540 --> 02:27:09.740
See, for me, because I've built chess engines

02:27:10.860 --> 02:27:12.660
without understanding chess much.

02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:16.900
As like, you know, as anyone does who's interested in AI,

02:27:16.900 --> 02:27:18.380
you build all kinds of systems

02:27:18.380 --> 02:27:21.620
that do all kinds of stuff and chess is just an easy game.

02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:25.100
Like it starts with Othello, goes up to chess and go.

02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:27.860
There's, it's just a great benchmark,

02:27:27.860 --> 02:27:30.380
a great place to explore different AI algorithms

02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:34.100
from search to machine learning and so on.

02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:38.660
But to me, cheating is like, it's a similar kind of ideas.

02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:41.980
Well, if I make it a board instead of eight by eight

02:27:41.980 --> 02:27:45.140
to 10 by 10, like how does it change things?

02:27:45.140 --> 02:27:47.380
And with cheating, it's almost like expanding

02:27:47.380 --> 02:27:50.940
the engineering challenge of chess out into the real world.

02:27:50.940 --> 02:27:53.180
To me, okay, so just allow me,

02:27:53.180 --> 02:27:55.340
I know cheating is horrible and everything.

02:27:56.740 --> 02:28:01.740
But, stockfish, AI engine and human working together

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:03.740
in interesting ways.

02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:07.900
Forget chess, just machine and human working together

02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:11.300
to expand the capability of the human is really fascinating.

02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:13.620
And that's like a beautiful thing to me.

02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:18.180
Of course, purely for the chess game, it ruins the game.

02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:23.180
But, I just like thinking of how AI

02:28:23.180 --> 02:28:24.580
can interact with the human

02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:29.620
in ways that doesn't, that is frictionless.

02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:32.340
Like, you know, like neural link,

02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:35.540
brain-computer interfaces dream of directly connecting

02:28:35.540 --> 02:28:38.420
the human brain to AI system.

02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:41.020
The problem in this case is I don't think the human

02:28:41.020 --> 02:28:43.860
and the AI are interacting together.

02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:46.780
The AI dominates, the human is just the mechanism

02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:47.940
that makes the moves.

02:28:47.940 --> 02:28:51.860
I actually played, if I may, maybe I need your advice

02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:55.020
on this, I thought, and I told myself I won't do it.

02:28:55.020 --> 02:28:59.300
And then a friend of mine said, and a couple of friends,

02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:04.220
and both of them are previous guests in this podcast,

02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:05.780
told me I definitely need to do it.

02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:10.100
Which is, you know, connect.

02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:13.180
So I already have, for the chess arm that I built,

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:15.820
this computer vision on the chessboard

02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:18.740
is able to extract from vision

02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:23.220
the way you do optical character recognition,

02:29:23.220 --> 02:29:24.380
extract the board.

02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:27.820
So I was gonna just build that cheating system

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:29.700
to demonstrate it with,

02:29:30.620 --> 02:29:32.060
the reason I thought it was interesting,

02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:35.260
so something we didn't mention is,

02:29:35.260 --> 02:29:36.500
I don't know who started this rumor,

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.380
but the rumor started that it might have been like

02:29:38.380 --> 02:29:41.940
Analbeads that, I don't know who started this,

02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.540
but I do know that Elon magnified it.

02:29:44.540 --> 02:29:46.460
My username was dead center in that thing

02:29:46.460 --> 02:29:48.740
that he retweeted, which was hilarious to me.

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:52.460
You're using it, what do you mean?

02:29:52.460 --> 02:29:56.140
He retweeted the clip, but also the copy pasta,

02:29:56.700 --> 02:30:01.020
the paragraph that was describing

02:30:01.020 --> 02:30:03.300
the whole Analbeads theory,

02:30:03.300 --> 02:30:05.100
and dead center in the middle of that paragraph

02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:08.060
is as Gotham Chess says,

02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:12.220
and the worst part about it was I was literally tagged,

02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:16.260
so it was as user slash Gotham Chess says.

02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:19.420
So every time that paragraph gets posted on Reddit,

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:20.260
I get tagged.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:23.140
Getting posted a lot.

02:30:23.140 --> 02:30:24.780
So yes, but yes, he tweeted.

02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:26.620
And then there's also the funny thing,

02:30:26.620 --> 02:30:31.220
which I really love, the weirdest, most entertaining thing.

02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.340
Was that part of the same thing,

02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:37.020
where like plot twist,

02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:39.580
Magnus has been using Analbeads this whole time,

02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:40.500
that's how he got.

02:30:40.500 --> 02:30:42.100
Yes, yes.

02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:44.500
Ah, I love that so much, okay.

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:46.260
But anyway, there's a,

02:30:49.700 --> 02:30:53.020
I quickly realized that there is,

02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:57.260
I have to admit that I know not much about sex toys.

02:30:58.740 --> 02:31:01.260
And then I quickly realized that there's a lot of sex toys

02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:04.220
that have Bluetooth capability that you can interact with.

02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:08.540
So it's very easy to connect Stockfish to a sex toys.

02:31:09.660 --> 02:31:10.980
Actually, wow.

02:31:10.980 --> 02:31:11.820
Actually, yes.

02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.980
So apparently that's a popular thing.

02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:18.980
Like a lot of sex toys are Bluetooth enabled

02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:20.300
so you can communicate with them.

02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:22.740
So this is actually pretty trivial to do.

02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:25.100
Not trivial, but then,

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:28.900
and then in fact, there's several libraries.

02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:31.420
One of them is really active called,

02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:33.820
now this is on GitHub, friends.

02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:35.940
It's in Rust, but I think there's Python wrappers.

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:39.100
It's called Buttplug, is the name of the library.

02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:41.420
That communicates with,

02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:44.020
it supports a bunch of different devices,

02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:46.500
a bunch of different like vibrators

02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:47.700
and all that kind of stuff.

02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:49.940
But then I looked at the kind of vibrators it supports

02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:51.260
and they're all like creepy looking.

02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:53.700
I mean, like it doesn't,

02:31:55.020 --> 02:32:00.020
it doesn't have, I don't know, it felt too dirty, you know?

02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:02.860
Like there's a line, I was like, is this not gonna,

02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:04.660
because the reason I like that kind of stuff

02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:06.260
is I like the joke of it

02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:09.460
that ultimately is somehow educational.

02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:10.980
Because to me, I really care about AI

02:32:10.980 --> 02:32:12.780
and this is a cool little project to do.

02:32:12.780 --> 02:32:14.100
It's pretty easy to share.

02:32:15.740 --> 02:32:17.340
Yeah, but I was thinking about doing it.

02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:18.460
I was thinking about doing it.

02:32:18.500 --> 02:32:21.580
At first I said, no, it kind of feels dirty.

02:32:21.580 --> 02:32:24.860
But then the aforementioned friend said,

02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:26.420
no, you should definitely do it.

02:32:27.340 --> 02:32:28.180
I like the huge-

02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:30.420
Who's your test subject?

02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:33.860
No, we wouldn't test, you're just on the table.

02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:35.780
I'm sure that people would sign up, right?

02:32:35.780 --> 02:32:38.620
I just went on the table, like show the vibration.

02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:41.800
You're basically converting,

02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:45.740
now it's not, I'm not obviously a grandmaster,

02:32:45.740 --> 02:32:48.060
so you have to say everything.

02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:50.300
No, you don't.

02:32:50.300 --> 02:32:52.940
You could say the square, you don't have to say the piece.

02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:54.380
The human will fill in the gap.

02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:56.300
No, a good human chess player.

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.140
I can't.

02:32:58.780 --> 02:33:00.820
That's the point I wanted to make is like,

02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:05.740
for me, I would like to know the actual move I need to make.

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:07.780
So I need the full information.

02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:12.780
So I have to convert the bishop, c5, whatever to Morse code,

02:33:13.140 --> 02:33:14.740
which is a lot of vibration.

02:33:15.660 --> 02:33:17.140
Yes, exactly.

02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:20.100
But it still works, it's hilarious and fun.

02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:21.660
So I was thinking about doing it,

02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:25.300
but it's pretty easy to do.

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:28.420
It would be just like a fun exercise.

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:32.580
I love a mix of technical rigor and humor.

02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:35.220
Well, this is the perfect project for that.

02:33:35.220 --> 02:33:36.060
Right, exactly.

02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:37.020
Yeah, this was born, I think,

02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:41.360
out of a user comment in a Twitch stream.

02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:43.420
So I thought it was born on Reddit, this theory,

02:33:43.420 --> 02:33:48.040
but I think Eric Hansen was streaming Chess Bra,

02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.640
and someone in his chat made that joke,

02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:51.920
and he read it out loud.

02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:54.240
That was the first time it was read out loud,

02:33:54.240 --> 02:33:55.480
and then somebody clipped it,

02:33:55.480 --> 02:33:59.760
and it became international news.

02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:03.840
Have you followed how big the traction got

02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:05.120
on this anal beads thing?

02:34:05.120 --> 02:34:05.960
No.

02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:08.520
It was covered by every major news network,

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:11.320
late night talk show, Trevor Noah, Stephen Colbert.

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:12.160
No.

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:14.960
International news, international news in countries

02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.720
like China, where I would have never thought

02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:19.000
that they would report about anal beads.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:19.840
Yeah.

02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:22.680
Did they, what was the tonality of it?

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:25.160
Was it seen as a joke, or did they say

02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:26.960
there's a cheating scandal?

02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:27.800
I think too much.

02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:29.480
How do you even mention anal beads?

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:30.940
Literally anal beads.

02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:35.940
Like just, accused, denies cheating with anal beads,

02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:39.960
which he never did.

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.840
He never denied cheating with anal beads.

02:34:41.840 --> 02:34:43.800
It was a joke internet theory.

02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:45.600
If I was him, I would lean into it.

02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:48.120
Yeah, I can't imagine, man.

02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:50.280
Like that's, I don't know what the right thing

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:51.920
for him to do is, but it's-

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:53.840
Are you not touching this one?

02:34:53.840 --> 02:34:55.280
I've talked about it.

02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:57.640
I don't say the words anal beads in my YouTube videos,

02:34:57.640 --> 02:34:58.720
but I'll say beads.

02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:00.760
Yeah, I'll, the thing is-

02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.560
Do you think I should do the code thing?

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.640
It's like a tutorial.

02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:05.760
Sure, yeah.

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:07.320
I think it would be hilarious.

02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:10.520
If you find a way to do it, yeah, you can show

02:35:10.520 --> 02:35:13.400
that it is possible to theoretically vibrate

02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:18.440
via Bluetooth, chess moves, and if someone shoves it

02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:22.080
up their ass, it was another joke.

02:35:22.080 --> 02:35:23.800
Okay, they offered you to play naked.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:25.520
They're gonna make you spread your cheeks?

02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:29.000
Yeah, I didn't understand why naked solved the problem.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.040
I think there's, it doesn't have to be naked.

02:35:31.040 --> 02:35:32.280
I don't think naked is enough.

02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:33.120
Yeah.

02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:36.880
Okay, some questions from Reddit.

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:42.120
Ask him, ask Levy if he deep down hates his audience.

02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:44.280
I saw that, yeah, I saw that was the top one.

02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:48.280
I have a love-hate relationship with the chess subreddit.

02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:51.160
So that's why some of those questions were gonna be tough.

02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:52.480
I have a love-hate relationship-

02:35:52.480 --> 02:35:53.480
Do you think that's a tough question,

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:55.720
or does that come from a place of love?

02:35:55.720 --> 02:35:58.400
Very tough to say, very tough to say.

02:35:58.400 --> 02:36:00.560
So love and hate, like they're basically

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:02.480
next door neighbors on Reddit, I feel like.

02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:03.320
Correct.

02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:05.200
They oscillate very quickly between each other.

02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:08.160
Yes, so Reddit chess specifically, I think,

02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:11.640
is mostly folks who are around before the chess boom.

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.400
So the chess-

02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:14.240
This is the chess subreddit?

02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:15.080
Sorry to interrupt.

02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:15.920
Yeah, yeah.

02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:18.080
So a lot of them have been around for five years,

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:20.760
seven years, 10 years, even more.

02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:23.560
And I think the average age on Reddit is lower

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.040
than the average age on the chess subreddit.

02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:29.600
I think that the chess subreddit is beyond the age of 20,

02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:30.640
maybe even 25.

02:36:30.640 --> 02:36:31.480
Like a lot of folks there are-

02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:34.200
Oh, ancient, ancient people in their mid-20s, yeah.

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:36.320
I mean, not 15 or 16.

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:37.520
Anarchy chess is younger,

02:36:37.520 --> 02:36:40.360
so anarchy chess is basically chess memes.

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:41.200
That's the subreddit name?

02:36:41.200 --> 02:36:42.040
Yes, you got it, yeah.

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:42.880
Anarchy chess, this is great.

02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:44.800
A lot of stupid memes on there.

02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:46.240
Do they like you or no?

02:36:46.240 --> 02:36:47.080
Or is it love-

02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:48.800
They did until my crypto sponsorship,

02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:55.240
which is a separate convo that I'm more than happy to have.

02:36:55.240 --> 02:37:00.240
But yeah, so my relationship with the Reddit chess subreddit

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:03.480
is tough because my content on YouTube

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:07.480
stops at a certain point with them.

02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:09.560
They can't learn from me

02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:12.520
because I'm tailoring to 95% of my audience,

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:14.960
which is about 16, 1700 and below.

02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:17.000
And I have a lot of content

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.520
where I jokingly make fun of low rated players.

02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:24.120
And everyone's in on it and we all have fun.

02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:26.120
And I laugh at myself a ton,

02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:28.600
laugh at, as you can even see in this conversation.

02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:31.800
But just like you mentioned with clips

02:37:31.800 --> 02:37:33.760
and out of context things,

02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:36.880
folks have already formed the perception of my personality.

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:39.040
There's nothing I can do to win them back.

02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:40.760
And I think the dominant percentage

02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:43.560
of the loudest group of folks on the chess subreddit,

02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:45.600
they just, they have a certain perception of me.

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:47.320
It's not going to change.

02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:49.640
And you add something like cryptocurrency sponsorship,

02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.720
which people on Reddit just in general

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.360
are relatively negative on the subject.

02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:57.600
It's gonna start snowballing more and more.

02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:00.560
So if you ever look up a thread of

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:04.120
should I buy a Gotham course and it's on Reddit chess?

02:38:04.120 --> 02:38:05.160
It's gonna say no.

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:07.600
Everyone's calling it a scam over price.

02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:08.440
Interesting.

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:10.720
I heard a lot of really positive stuff.

02:38:10.720 --> 02:38:13.320
I don't know where, on Reddit in general.

02:38:13.320 --> 02:38:14.160
About me?

02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:15.000
Yeah.

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:16.080
You might've been looking for it.

02:38:16.080 --> 02:38:18.960
You might've not been looking for negative things.

02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:19.800
And I do-

02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:23.120
No, I was looking for like best educators online.

02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:23.960
Like that kind of stuff.

02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:26.240
I don't, it might've not been Reddit chess.

02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.240
I'll be totally honest with you.

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:29.880
If you ever go there and look for something like

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:34.240
best recaps or best educational content for intermediates,

02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:35.080
I'm not mentioned.

02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:36.080
I might not be mentioned

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:38.640
because I'm already expected to be on the list.

02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:40.560
So they just kind of want to generally shout out

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:41.480
smaller creators.

02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:42.720
Totally fine with that.

02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:44.800
And I'm not even going on this whole explanation

02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:46.760
because I want to win folks back.

02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:48.840
It's just sort of the reality of the situation.

02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.800
A lot of my stuff is really clickbaity

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:53.600
and I'm playing the YouTube game.

02:38:53.600 --> 02:38:54.440
They don't want that.

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:56.200
Do you ever feel like a limit

02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:02.160
or a tension between your creativity and the YouTube algorithm?

02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.960
Like do you feel like it has negative effects on you?

02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:08.160
Yeah, I want to cover more in depth stuff

02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:11.240
in a 30 minute video that I think is super useful to people.

02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:13.400
It's only going to get 60,000 views.

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.680
And you feel, why is that a bad thing?

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:18.760
Is it good to mix it up?

02:39:18.760 --> 02:39:22.280
Yes, it's good to mix it up, but I make a video a day.

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:23.800
I make one bad video.

02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:25.440
The other videos suffer.

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:30.200
And then if I make two videos that underperform,

02:39:30.200 --> 02:39:32.480
the rest of the videos don't get pushed out as much.

02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:34.800
Your earnings can go down 40% day to day

02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:37.880
which doesn't happen in other careers.

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.440
And if I ever want to supplement,

02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:42.840
if I ever want to make a very instructional video,

02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:45.200
I try to do it in a very fun way.

02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.320
So something like eight of Magnus Carlsen's best end games.

02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:49.880
You can still learn a ton.

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:52.200
But the concept of the video is going to be different.

02:39:52.200 --> 02:39:53.600
Like I try to still teach things

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:56.240
but in more interesting and exciting ways.

02:39:56.240 --> 02:40:01.240
Like the guy who was scammed for a million dollars,

02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:04.360
Alexis Shirov, who has basically promised

02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:05.240
the world championship.

02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:06.720
If he won his match, he won his match.

02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:08.840
He didn't get a world championship.

02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:10.360
So there's still stuff in there you can learn.

02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:13.520
And you can, my goal is just you click on the video,

02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:15.280
you learn something and you enjoy yourself.

02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:16.120
That's it.

02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:21.120
Get people to click on it by any means necessary.

02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:23.760
But once they're there, have quality stuff they can learn.

02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:28.760
And yeah, man, I wish, so I have zero of those pressures

02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:33.000
but I also really, really, like I turn off views

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:33.960
and all that kind of stuff.

02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:35.800
I don't pay attention to any of that.

02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:39.120
But I wish YouTube would like,

02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:45.400
the algorithm would include how good the video is.

02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:49.120
Like beneficial for people's long-term wellbeing

02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:52.080
in the calculation.

02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:53.840
I actually really hate the fact

02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:56.320
that they turned off dislikes.

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:57.840
Yeah, I didn't get that at all.

02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:00.520
Because now I don't know the difference between,

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:02.280
for tutorials specifically,

02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:05.280
I don't know what's a good chess video or not.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.920
Or what's a good review or not.

02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:10.720
I mean, it emphasizes following certain people more

02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:12.040
than if you trust the creator.

02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:16.800
But man, I really don't know what's a good video or not,

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:17.640
essentially.

02:41:17.640 --> 02:41:19.320
And then you have to trust more the title.

02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:22.840
Then the click baitiness comes in and it's no good.

02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:25.480
You have to use your own gut instinct as opposed to data.

02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:26.320
Sucks.

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:28.600
Yeah, there's videos that have almost no views

02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:29.800
that are still great.

02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:30.720
Incredible.

02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.560
And some of the best ones,

02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:36.440
some people who are just focused on the quality

02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:38.040
and don't wanna play the game,

02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:39.200
or don't even know how to play

02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:40.600
and they don't really wanna play the game

02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:42.360
of the YouTube algorithm.

02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:43.920
Yeah, it sucks.

02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:46.560
It sucks, especially given how dominant YouTube is

02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:52.400
in defining the creative energy

02:41:52.400 --> 02:41:55.560
of our whole civilization of the youth.

02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:56.840
Not just chess.

02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:57.840
Not just chess.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:02.400
When are you going to chess box against Eric Rosen?

02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:03.640
This is a question from Reddit.

02:42:03.640 --> 02:42:07.400
Chess box, you said your hands are all messed up.

02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:09.120
Yeah, yeah.

02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:12.120
Are you training for something or regular?

02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:15.400
So I also just remembered we never talked about Hikaru,

02:42:15.400 --> 02:42:17.320
so I can talk about Rosen and Hikaru

02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:20.000
in the same chess boxing sense.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.360
Is this your McGregor shit talk segment?

02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:25.800
No, no, no, no.

02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:27.680
Eric Rosen is actually a close friend of mine.

02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.840
I probably have five of those,

02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.200
and he just so happens to be not just a chess streamer,

02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:36.680
but we talked about buying homes,

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.960
we've talked about, he's stayed at my place.

02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:40.840
He took my wedding photos.

02:42:40.840 --> 02:42:43.080
I flew him to New York and paid for all his stuff

02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:45.320
just so he could hang out with my wife and I

02:42:45.320 --> 02:42:49.360
and take some 6AM photos in the sun in the park.

02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:50.640
Oh, he looks familiar.

02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:51.720
Yeah.

02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:53.840
So he's a good friend of mine.

02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:56.240
Now, in terms of chess boxing,

02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:58.320
chess boxing is this really fascinating sport

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:01.120
where you have boxing, but you also have chess,

02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:03.000
and you have rounds.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.280
So you start a chess game with a clock.

02:43:05.280 --> 02:43:08.280
That segment itself lasts for a couple of minutes.

02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:10.120
They put the board away and pause the clock,

02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:11.560
whatever the time situation is,

02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.200
then you box for a minute, and that keeps going on.

02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:18.080
I don't know how it works in terms of the time expiring,

02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:20.680
meaning in fighting, there's judges

02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:22.720
that just tell you how the fight was going, right?

02:43:22.760 --> 02:43:24.880
Here, I don't know who wins and how.

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:26.840
Like, do you win by, you can win by knockout,

02:43:26.840 --> 02:43:28.000
you can win by checkmate,

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.720
or their clock can run out on the chessboard,

02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:30.560
but is there-

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:31.400
Who judges?

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:33.160
Who, is there a round limit?

02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:35.640
Does this just go on and on and on and on?

02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:36.480
You know what I mean?

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:37.880
Yeah, I thought it's like 12 rounds, right?

02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:40.600
Isn't this a thing in Russia?

02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:42.000
It's a big thing in the UK.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:42.840
UK?

02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:44.560
Yeah, UK, I don't know why.

02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:48.200
And there's a lot of YouTuber events just for boxing.

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:50.960
So YouTubers just learn to box,

02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:52.640
and then they just box, no chess.

02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:55.000
They just straight up box each other.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:56.560
Like Jake Paul, for example.

02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.200
You ever gonna get Jake Paul in here?

02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:59.360
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

02:43:59.360 --> 02:44:00.200
Okay.

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.040
I'm sure.

02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:04.240
I feel like so many different guests have been mentioned.

02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:06.280
Yeah, Jake Paul would be a fun guest,

02:44:06.280 --> 02:44:07.520
but he's obviously the biggest scorer.

02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:09.040
He's legitimately boxing people.

02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:10.320
He's not, yeah.

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:12.400
But chess players are never gonna learn

02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:13.440
to box to that level,

02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:16.200
and all of us are starting basically from zero.

02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:19.080
And Ludwig talked to me behind the scenes,

02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:20.440
said, hey, how would you feel about being

02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:22.160
in a chess boxing match?

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:25.560
I said, okay, yeah, maybe.

02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:26.400
When is it gonna be?

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:27.880
He said, five months from now.

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:29.840
I've always wanted to train combat.

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:31.720
I've weight lifted, I've done cardio,

02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:32.560
I've played basketball.

02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:33.480
And you said you're a UFC fan, too?

02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:34.320
Yeah.

02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:35.760
So you admire fighting?

02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:37.320
Yeah, I would enjoy it.

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:40.240
I just have a really bad lower back,

02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:43.440
and that makes a lot of different combat difficult.

02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:45.040
But I said, you know what, screw this.

02:44:45.040 --> 02:44:47.760
I'm going to contact a few local gyms.

02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:49.960
And one of them, the guy emailing me back and forth,

02:44:49.960 --> 02:44:52.200
had actually watched my YouTube videos.

02:44:52.680 --> 02:44:54.280
So he was the first to respond.

02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:55.600
And he said, yeah, like come in,

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.480
do a couple classes, like see how you feel.

02:44:57.480 --> 02:44:59.680
So first I did conditioning, which killed me,

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:01.840
because fighting conditioning, as you know,

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:02.680
it kills you.

02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:04.760
It's a completely different type of conditioning.

02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:07.400
But I felt good, and I really wanted to come back.

02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:10.360
And since July, I've been training three, four days a week.

02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:11.560
Nice, and you feel pretty good?

02:45:11.560 --> 02:45:12.400
I love it.

02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:13.240
Lower back feels good?

02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:14.080
Lower back, everything feels good.

02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:14.920
The whole body got stronger.

02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:17.520
So what you're saying is you're gonna fuck up Hikaru.

02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:20.080
Is he training?

02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:21.360
I'm not fighting.

02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:23.520
So I talked to Eric about it.

02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:26.280
And the truth is we're both concerned about head trauma.

02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.920
I haven't actually sparred.

02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:29.640
I like sparring, shadow boxing.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:31.000
But I go there, I do personal training.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.440
I don't do a group class.

02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:34.520
I'm not fighting.

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:35.520
I'm fighting the bag.

02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:36.880
I'm doing shadow boxing.

02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:38.320
My form is improving.

02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:39.280
But I haven't been punched.

02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:40.480
I get hit in the stomach.

02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:42.520
I get hit in the side with kicks.

02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:44.400
Nobody's punched me in the face yet.

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.800
So I think we both were adequately concerned about that.

02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:48.960
And there was not some ridiculous amount of money

02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:49.800
on the table.

02:45:49.800 --> 02:45:52.680
So we decided it's just not worth pursuing.

02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:55.440
How does Hikaru come into the picture?

02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:58.280
Because he's a possible competitor?

02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:01.080
People ask me all the time, who would you fight?

02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:03.920
People are like, Andrea Botes will kick your ass.

02:46:03.920 --> 02:46:04.760
That's a tough one.

02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:05.720
Because I can't, what am I gonna say?

02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:09.360
I'm gonna fight a woman who I'm larger than.

02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:11.160
So I just have to take the L against

02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:12.480
anytime a woman is mentioned.

02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:13.320
That's fine.

02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:14.240
There's no winning that one.

02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:15.080
Right, exactly.

02:46:15.080 --> 02:46:19.080
So I've lost to both Boteses, Anna Rudolph, Anna Kremling.

02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:20.320
They're all chess creators.

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.040
And like hypothetically?

02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:22.880
Yeah, I get asked.

02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:23.720
Hypothetical fight?

02:46:23.720 --> 02:46:24.560
Yeah, yeah.

02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:25.400
Okay.

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:26.800
He's been training.

02:46:26.800 --> 02:46:28.680
I think, yeah, Andrea has been training.

02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:30.440
That's because an event got announced.

02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.720
This event that I was hypothetically gonna be

02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:34.480
the main event against Eric Rosen.

02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:35.320
Yeah.

02:46:35.320 --> 02:46:36.160
It was announced.

02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:37.000
Yeah.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.320
And then you kinda like thought,

02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:40.600
like maybe let's not do this.

02:46:40.600 --> 02:46:43.680
No, I knew once I declined to fight Eric

02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:45.560
that I would not be participating.

02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:47.120
And I even knew, you know,

02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:49.280
I knew who was gonna be the main event

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.400
because I was kind of offered both of those guys.

02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:53.240
So I'm on Hamilton.

02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:54.720
Oh, is this still going on?

02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.560
The chess boxing event will happen

02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:57.800
in December in Los Angeles.

02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.640
Yeah. Nice.

02:46:58.640 --> 02:46:59.640
So who is the main event?

02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:02.560
It's I'm on Hamilton, who's also a chess bra.

02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:04.080
So they have a couple of guys

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:05.960
as part of the chess bra channel and Lawrence Trent.

02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:09.480
Lawrence Trent is a international master from England.

02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:14.080
He's a, I think he's done some boxing a little bit.

02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:16.520
He's a commentator, brash guy.

02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:17.400
Nice.

02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:18.480
Controversial guy, yeah.

02:47:19.520 --> 02:47:20.520
It's funny, cause they started,

02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:21.960
Lawrence put out some videos and I went,

02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:24.040
damn, I should have done this.

02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:25.240
Yeah, I think.

02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:28.760
I mean, you're right.

02:47:28.760 --> 02:47:30.320
First of all, there's so many things to say.

02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:32.760
One of which is, if you're,

02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.280
if you want to take it seriously, you know,

02:47:34.280 --> 02:47:35.760
it does pull you in.

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:38.160
Like, you know, if you train a lot,

02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:39.760
it's gonna affect the rest of your life.

02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.200
And then, and then there's, it changes you.

02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:45.880
I think taking combat sports seriously changes you

02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:49.760
in good, and there's negative cost to it, I think.

02:47:49.760 --> 02:47:51.200
Cause it's a whole nother thing, man.

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:54.000
It's like, it's like doing a marathon running or something.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.080
It really pulls you in.

02:47:55.080 --> 02:47:58.120
And the other thing is the, is the head trauma.

02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:00.120
Like, yeah, you have to take that kind of stuff seriously,

02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:01.320
especially if you're doing sparring

02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:02.480
and all that kind of stuff.

02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:05.920
Still, some of the celebrities,

02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.280
I don't know why, but it's pretty exciting, right?

02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:10.960
I don't know why it'd be fun to watch Hikaru.

02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.120
Like there's something.

02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:15.520
Well, I always said, if Hikaru and Magnus did a boxing event

02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:18.920
and I was the co-main event against, I don't know who.

02:48:18.920 --> 02:48:20.560
That would, that'd be, that'd be-

02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:22.280
Has Magnus said anything about it?

02:48:22.280 --> 02:48:24.520
Like about doing chess boxing?

02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:27.480
Well, first of all, he's gonna commentate the Ludwig event.

02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:28.320
Nice.

02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:29.960
Which he, which he said, he kind of said,

02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:31.440
oh, there's been people in the past

02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.880
that are my level in chess, not mine, his level in chess,

02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:37.640
and have wanted to get physical with him.

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:39.120
I think he's talking about Hikaru.

02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:41.960
It's, it's, I don't think anybody else is.

02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:43.160
That'd be, that'd be a good one, man.

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:43.980
That'd be a good one.

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:44.820
I think Magnus-

02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:45.980
What is that one?

02:48:45.980 --> 02:48:49.540
I think Magnus is in better physical shape.

02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:52.220
He's also a little bit bigger, I think, than Hikaru.

02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:53.060
Longer reach.

02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:54.820
I think Hikaru's a dog, though.

02:48:54.820 --> 02:48:57.060
I think, I think he'll, I don't think he's gonna,

02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:57.940
he's gonna get out of there.

02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:00.500
Like I don't think he's gonna quit out in the ring.

02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:03.340
I would think Hikaru just goes nuts in the beginning

02:49:03.340 --> 02:49:04.420
and burns himself out.

02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:07.020
So if Magnus can survive that,

02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:08.780
I feel like Hikaru would just go crazy

02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:09.980
and then just get exhausted,

02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:12.020
would not be able to pace himself correctly.

02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:12.860
Maybe.

02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:14.260
Chasing that first round knockout.

02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.100
Yeah.

02:49:15.100 --> 02:49:15.940
Yeah.

02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:16.780
Just swing like crazy.

02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:19.140
Honestly, I'd just love to see that,

02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:23.580
which is like the effect of physical exertion on the game.

02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:24.420
I think it's-

02:49:24.420 --> 02:49:26.820
I'm sure they're strong enough to-

02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:30.180
Yes, but I think we definitely underestimate the effect

02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:33.380
of being punched, maybe bleeding out of your nose

02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:34.220
or something like that.

02:49:34.220 --> 02:49:35.620
Yeah, it's no joke.

02:49:35.620 --> 02:49:39.620
I can't, I can't say I'm anticipating the first day

02:49:39.620 --> 02:49:42.420
I actually do some sparring and get seriously hit,

02:49:42.420 --> 02:49:44.940
because I know it's not gonna feel good.

02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:47.860
Even now I take a hard jab to the stomach or the ribs

02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:49.700
and I'm just like, man, this is rough.

02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:53.540
I mean, I had to do three minutes on heavy bag.

02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:55.940
And when I finished,

02:49:55.940 --> 02:49:59.180
I had been like slacking on my form

02:49:59.180 --> 02:50:00.580
because my arms were tired

02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:02.860
and I hit with my fingers instead of my knuckles

02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:06.300
and my hands are like, you can see the red skin,

02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:08.740
like completely pink, meaty skin under.

02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:10.300
I didn't realize when I was hitting,

02:50:10.300 --> 02:50:13.300
and only today the pain is unbearable.

02:50:13.300 --> 02:50:15.900
So I can't imagine, head, it must be-

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:18.340
No, I mean, it gets, it's a different thing.

02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:20.100
I mean, of course your skin gets tougher,

02:50:20.100 --> 02:50:22.060
everything gets tougher, so it gets used to it.

02:50:22.060 --> 02:50:23.980
The head is a weird one,

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:26.460
because it's not gonna send you those kinds of signals.

02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:29.220
You're not gonna get the skin type of signals.

02:50:30.300 --> 02:50:32.820
The brain is a weird thing because it doesn't hurt.

02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:33.940
Yeah.

02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:35.140
It just does the damage

02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:37.180
and the damage can materialize itself,

02:50:37.180 --> 02:50:39.660
manifest itself only years later.

02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:40.980
It's a weird one.

02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:42.740
But then we all die.

02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:44.500
There's that Braveheart speech.

02:50:45.700 --> 02:50:47.060
I gotta ask you about bots,

02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:48.900
because to me it's like super interesting

02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:51.500
and you've played a lot of bots at different levels.

02:50:53.540 --> 02:50:54.460
You have a video called

02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:57.940
the advanced chess bots are terrifying.

02:50:57.940 --> 02:51:01.180
So what's the difference between playing humans and bots?

02:51:01.180 --> 02:51:03.260
Like you mentioned this Nelson bot.

02:51:03.260 --> 02:51:04.100
Yeah.

02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:07.060
Brings his queen out, I think rated 1,600.

02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:07.900
1,400.

02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:08.740
Okay, 1,400.

02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:11.060
So like there's a style to those.

02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:14.020
What's the difference between the way bots play

02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:15.660
and the way humans play?

02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:17.900
A lot of people prefer playing bots

02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:19.980
because they have anxiety playing other humans.

02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:21.380
It's a very legitimate thing.

02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:22.220
Interesting.

02:51:22.220 --> 02:51:24.340
A lot of beginners, they don't like live chess.

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:26.940
They get nervous, ELO anxiety,

02:51:26.940 --> 02:51:29.700
you get close to your highest ever rating, you panic.

02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:30.580
Happens to me too.

02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:31.420
Yeah.

02:51:31.420 --> 02:51:33.140
Happens to me even now.

02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:34.260
So they play bots.

02:51:34.260 --> 02:51:36.180
They're somehow more reliable or something?

02:51:36.180 --> 02:51:38.140
Yeah, they're, I don't know.

02:51:38.500 --> 02:51:39.540
It's a big thing.

02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:40.380
It's a big thing.

02:51:40.380 --> 02:51:42.140
And the popularity of that video shows

02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:45.380
that people enjoy watching you play chess bots.

02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:49.260
So I'm gonna demystify this.

02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:50.460
This might be shocking.

02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:54.820
Those bots are all the same bot for the most part.

02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:57.340
You could just program a bot

02:51:57.340 --> 02:52:00.220
to make mistakes at a certain moment.

02:52:00.220 --> 02:52:04.100
You could program a bot to spend less time on certain moves.

02:52:04.100 --> 02:52:06.700
And it's gotten sophisticated enough

02:52:06.700 --> 02:52:07.900
that you can basically program it

02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:11.220
to play at whatever more or less level

02:52:11.220 --> 02:52:12.420
that a human plays at.

02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:14.940
You say, oh, play at an 1800 level.

02:52:14.940 --> 02:52:17.540
So it's programmed to throw in mistakes.

02:52:17.540 --> 02:52:20.820
The problem is, and this is why it's all beginners

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:22.540
to not play bots,

02:52:22.540 --> 02:52:25.380
because bots are programmed in the following way.

02:52:25.380 --> 02:52:29.100
Beginner bots are like literal toddlers.

02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:31.260
They have no understanding whatsoever.

02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:32.980
They will literally lose all their pieces,

02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:34.180
but they won't lose all their pieces

02:52:34.180 --> 02:52:35.580
and make mistakes the way beginners do.

02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:37.660
Beginners actually know how to start a game.

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:42.100
They just struggle the first eight moves, nine moves.

02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:43.700
Their mistakes are very different than bot.

02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:46.380
Bot plays completely outlandish types of mistakes

02:52:46.380 --> 02:52:49.260
that you cannot pick up in terms of a pattern standpoint,

02:52:49.260 --> 02:52:51.020
because no actual humans play like that.

02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:52.740
They just move their queen to the opposite side of the board

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:54.580
and for no reason, you can take it.

02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:56.460
Yeah, it's not even a blunder.

02:52:56.460 --> 02:52:57.860
It's almost like randomness.

02:52:57.860 --> 02:52:59.180
Yeah, it's completely random.

02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:01.220
And this problem extends further,

02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:04.220
because advanced bots will play an opening

02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:07.100
completely reasonably and they'll just hang a rook,

02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:09.980
which okay, maybe happens,

02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:12.100
but that's not exactly how you get to 1800.

02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:14.540
At 1800, that's a very strong level of the game.

02:53:14.540 --> 02:53:16.300
You know your openings very well.

02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:17.740
You start navigating the middle game

02:53:17.740 --> 02:53:20.380
based on already things that you remember.

02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:22.660
And then basically one side chooses a bad plan

02:53:22.660 --> 02:53:24.220
and the other side chooses a better plan.

02:53:24.220 --> 02:53:25.780
And one thing leads to another.

02:53:25.780 --> 02:53:28.580
Nobody just recreationally hangs all their pieces,

02:53:28.580 --> 02:53:30.540
which is the way bots are kind of programmed to play.

02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:33.300
But some of those bots in that video were,

02:53:33.300 --> 02:53:37.900
I remember playing them and they were nuts.

02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:39.820
They were out calculating me every time I thought

02:53:39.820 --> 02:53:43.260
I had a trick in two, three second moment of thought.

02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:45.020
It would just play the best move.

02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:46.220
And sometimes that also happens.

02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:50.020
It gets into a dead loop where it just starts bulldozing you

02:53:50.020 --> 02:53:51.340
and it can't stop.

02:53:51.340 --> 02:53:53.180
So it made its mistakes already.

02:53:53.180 --> 02:53:55.380
It's programmed to make only a few

02:53:55.380 --> 02:53:57.340
and then it just bulldozes you the rest of the way.

02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:58.180
Interesting.

02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:02.180
I mean, that's why I played with Stockfish a bunch.

02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:08.820
So I built for myself a bunch of different

02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:11.140
chess experiments recently.

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:13.100
It had to do with the chess playing bot.

02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:16.020
But I also built the infinite chess board

02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:18.300
where it was Stockfish was playing

02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:20.820
like an infinite number of chess games.

02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:24.420
And one of the parameters that was interesting to play with

02:54:24.420 --> 02:54:27.580
is how long it gets to think about a move

02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:29.820
and how that affects the rating of the thing.

02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:31.780
Oh, I did that a little bit.

02:54:31.780 --> 02:54:32.980
So that's a tricky one.

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:34.500
I'm sure people know how to do that well,

02:54:34.500 --> 02:54:38.660
but it's not trivial to understand what,

02:54:38.660 --> 02:54:41.060
there must be a good formula for it.

02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:43.540
But it's also interesting to think about

02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:45.300
a controlled number of blunders.

02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:50.500
But it's probably better,

02:54:50.500 --> 02:54:51.740
the controlled number of blunders

02:54:51.740 --> 02:54:53.980
is not a good way to build a bot.

02:54:54.980 --> 02:54:56.780
For training purposes at least.

02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:59.660
The time per move is probably better.

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:01.340
But the craziest thing is I did that

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:04.860
with a couple of my devs who are helping me with the,

02:55:04.860 --> 02:55:07.740
build like a, I'm scaling my courses

02:55:07.740 --> 02:55:10.540
into a better chess learning platform essentially.

02:55:10.540 --> 02:55:13.340
We've done a lot of different experiments with Stockfish,

02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:15.340
which I'm even happy to get into here.

02:55:16.580 --> 02:55:19.620
And Stockfish making moves in 0.1 millisecond

02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:22.500
plays better than a human, which is disgusting.

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:24.940
And disturbing frankly, because that's crazy.

02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:27.620
Like you can't react to a car stopping in front of you

02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:29.020
anywhere near that fast.

02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:33.180
Yeah, so the reason I was interested in that

02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:35.740
is because when you have a very large chess board,

02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:38.700
you have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands

02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:40.900
of game going on at the same time.

02:55:40.900 --> 02:55:44.820
You have to think of the minimum amount

02:55:44.820 --> 02:55:48.380
of thinking per move that you can allow for.

02:55:48.380 --> 02:55:51.780
And it does seem, it's damn good.

02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:55.500
At least to my eye, basically at the lowest possible

02:55:55.500 --> 02:55:56.580
setting you can give it.

02:55:56.580 --> 02:55:58.540
So yeah, it's incredible.

02:55:58.540 --> 02:55:59.860
It's incredible what bots are able to do.

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:02.780
And now it's, as far as I know,

02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:05.540
is primarily machine learning based Stockfish.

02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:07.860
So Stockfish moved to machine learning completely.

02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:10.980
It's not doing search as far as I know.

02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:14.020
Yeah, this is where you lose me a bit,

02:56:14.020 --> 02:56:16.540
but the move discovery and evaluation

02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:19.820
is what's been changing in the way Stockfish works.

02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:23.220
So it's discovering of moves and then the way it looks

02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:25.820
forward and then evaluates positions, that has changed.

02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:29.940
But Matthew Sadler, who wrote the book Game Changer

02:56:29.940 --> 02:56:34.380
about Alpha Zero, that he explains it significantly better.

02:56:34.380 --> 02:56:36.620
But that's the way I think it works.

02:56:37.740 --> 02:56:39.340
What did that make you feel when you first saw

02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:40.500
Alpha Zero play?

02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:41.340
I was excited.

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:45.740
I didn't have any sort of existential thoughts.

02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:49.140
I enjoyed watching it completely destroy openings

02:56:49.140 --> 02:56:51.140
that people thought were good.

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:56.860
And that experiment though does have some caveat

02:56:57.020 --> 02:57:00.100
in the sense that I think Alpha Zero was playing

02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:02.780
with a full tank of servers and I think Stockfish wasn't,

02:57:02.780 --> 02:57:05.060
which I think is one of the things people point out.

02:57:05.060 --> 02:57:05.900
They weren't playing.

02:57:05.900 --> 02:57:08.580
Since then they were able to demonstrate much less.

02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:09.420
Yeah.

02:57:11.380 --> 02:57:15.300
But also Alpha Zero stopped developing.

02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:16.820
They stopped developing it.

02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:18.060
Yes.

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:20.820
Which sucks, but again, from their perspective,

02:57:21.500 --> 02:57:23.020
from DeepMind's perspective, it's like, all right,

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:25.060
well we took on this really tricky game.

02:57:25.060 --> 02:57:27.780
Did something honestly incredible.

02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:28.620
They won.

02:57:29.540 --> 02:57:30.940
They won.

02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:33.820
Not just won, they did it without any human supervision.

02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:38.820
So without any training on human expert games.

02:57:38.860 --> 02:57:40.700
So only through self play, which,

02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:44.140
I mean that's what learning is about.

02:57:44.140 --> 02:57:47.460
It's what you think of as a child, a human child, a toddler.

02:57:47.460 --> 02:57:51.260
Learning from, you know, somewhat nothing

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:54.100
and becoming a capable human.

02:57:54.100 --> 02:57:57.900
That's what we think of when we think about intelligence.

02:57:57.900 --> 02:57:59.700
So the fact that it's able to play itself

02:57:59.700 --> 02:58:03.220
and become the best player in the world at the game of Go

02:58:03.220 --> 02:58:05.620
in all kinds of games is just incredible.

02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:08.660
And obviously that inspired the modern Stockfish

02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:12.220
to do all the same kind of self play methods.

02:58:13.220 --> 02:58:16.780
Somebody on Reddit asked a pretty interesting question.

02:58:16.780 --> 02:58:19.300
I don't know if you have an interesting answer to it.

02:58:19.300 --> 02:58:22.300
What makes a chess move, quote unquote, human?

02:58:23.620 --> 02:58:26.460
As you are someone, oh, this is to me,

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:29.020
but it's mentioning you in third person.

02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:30.580
As you are someone working in AI,

02:58:30.580 --> 02:58:33.660
this idea of humanness would seem incredibly interesting.

02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:35.180
Yes sir, it is.

02:58:35.180 --> 02:58:38.780
Especially since most cheat detection relies on humanness

02:58:38.780 --> 02:58:40.660
as a way to detect cheaters.

02:58:40.660 --> 02:58:42.860
I think since children being born right now

02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:45.900
will have the advantage of engine training their whole life,

02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:49.140
they will start to see the game the way an engine does.

02:58:49.140 --> 02:58:50.700
Will a person be considered a cheater

02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:52.220
if they play like an engine?

02:58:53.260 --> 02:58:55.540
There also seem to be a discrepancy,

02:58:55.540 --> 02:58:57.900
especially with Levy, about who can play

02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:00.140
what appears to be a non-human move.

02:59:00.140 --> 02:59:02.340
He often says things like, quote,

02:59:02.340 --> 02:59:06.300
if you were a normal player, normal in quotes,

02:59:06.300 --> 02:59:09.340
if you were a normal player, I would think you were cheating.

02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:13.020
But since it's Magnus, I don't doubt Magnus is great,

02:59:13.020 --> 02:59:14.500
but if humanness is our benchmark,

02:59:14.500 --> 02:59:16.380
what is the ELO rating where your moves

02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:19.340
can start to look like an engine without critique?

02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:21.140
There's a bunch of questions in there.

02:59:21.140 --> 02:59:24.100
They combine two of my quotes into one.

02:59:24.100 --> 02:59:26.820
So one thing that I like to say is,

02:59:26.820 --> 02:59:29.100
sometimes in a chess game, moves look,

02:59:29.100 --> 02:59:31.380
or an opening looks so ridiculous

02:59:31.380 --> 02:59:33.100
that if a viewer played it,

02:59:33.100 --> 02:59:34.780
I would make fun of them or slap them.

02:59:34.780 --> 02:59:35.620
That's always the joke.

02:59:35.620 --> 02:59:36.980
If I was your chess coach, I'd smack you.

02:59:36.980 --> 02:59:40.740
But when Magnus plays it, it was, oh wow,

02:59:40.740 --> 02:59:41.860
it's very different.

02:59:41.860 --> 02:59:45.220
So they mixed up this quote with another quote,

02:59:45.220 --> 02:59:50.220
which is, you know, if I, if,

02:59:51.100 --> 02:59:52.500
I'll be explaining something and I'll say,

02:59:52.500 --> 02:59:54.900
oh, and here the engine says you should play like this.

02:59:54.900 --> 02:59:56.980
If one of your opponents plays like this,

02:59:56.980 --> 02:59:58.540
report them for cheating.

02:59:58.540 --> 02:59:59.780
So they fused two quotes.

02:59:59.780 --> 03:00:02.220
They said, oh, human can't play like that,

03:00:02.220 --> 03:00:04.260
but because it's an engine move,

03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.700
but because Magnus is playing.

03:00:05.700 --> 03:00:07.740
So they mixed kind of two things.

03:00:07.740 --> 03:00:11.100
So there's interesting levels of humor

03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:14.540
and insight there on both of those.

03:00:14.540 --> 03:00:17.260
Yeah, the difference between human move and engine

03:00:17.260 --> 03:00:20.500
and like what an engine move is, is I think two things.

03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:25.500
Number one, a computer move is outlandish in its concept

03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:33.900
and its idea.

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:35.660
So the best example that I can give of that is

03:00:35.660 --> 03:00:37.860
if you gave a hundred grandmasters a position

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:39.580
and told them, you know,

03:00:39.580 --> 03:00:41.220
what do you think the best move here is for black?

03:00:41.220 --> 03:00:43.260
Not in this position, right here, we have nothing,

03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:45.820
but an overwhelming amount of them would look

03:00:45.820 --> 03:00:47.980
at the position, evaluate everything they know

03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:50.100
about the game of chess, which is relatively similar,

03:00:50.100 --> 03:00:53.700
but obviously slightly imbalanced based on their skill level.

03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:55.060
And they would come up with a sample size

03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:56.740
of two or three moves.

03:00:56.740 --> 03:00:59.980
And in comes the computer with a fucking haymaker.

03:00:59.980 --> 03:01:01.420
And suddenly everybody goes,

03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:05.100
oh, everything we know about chess has gone out the window.

03:01:05.100 --> 03:01:06.300
So they all start looking at that move

03:01:06.300 --> 03:01:07.140
and they know it's the best move.

03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:11.180
So now they start adding the evidence behind the verdict

03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:12.980
as opposed to getting to the verdict

03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:15.140
while first looking at the evidence.

03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:19.460
So the concept of it and the idea of it is so outlandish

03:01:19.460 --> 03:01:21.820
based on a certain type of position

03:01:21.820 --> 03:01:23.660
that you can't fully grasp it.

03:01:23.660 --> 03:01:25.820
You have to continue to beg the engine

03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:28.060
to tell you what the variation is.

03:01:28.060 --> 03:01:30.940
A move is only good if its extension is good.

03:01:30.940 --> 03:01:32.540
That's the way chess works.

03:01:32.540 --> 03:01:34.620
So it's like a move is good.

03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:36.340
It's because the computer has seen

03:01:36.340 --> 03:01:39.300
that the various branches of things going forward

03:01:39.300 --> 03:01:40.340
are also good.

03:01:40.340 --> 03:01:41.380
So you bring all that back

03:01:41.380 --> 03:01:44.100
and no human could have even conceptualized

03:01:44.100 --> 03:01:45.540
that initial thing.

03:01:45.540 --> 03:01:47.300
But the second thing about computer moves

03:01:47.300 --> 03:01:50.500
is they look counterintuitive.

03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:54.300
So if you might be in a position

03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:59.300
where it looks like the demands of the position are A, B, C,

03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:01.820
and then the computer is like, nope, it's not,

03:02:01.820 --> 03:02:02.940
because I've seen the future

03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:04.300
way more than you possibly could have.

03:02:04.940 --> 03:02:05.900
And I don't have emotions.

03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:10.820
So like dumb moves and brilliant moves can look similar.

03:02:10.820 --> 03:02:13.060
Yes, and oftentimes do.

03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:14.940
And this is actually back to the Hans thing.

03:02:14.940 --> 03:02:17.980
A lot of people now dissecting these games they're playing

03:02:17.980 --> 03:02:20.100
and they're basically saying,

03:02:20.100 --> 03:02:21.260
like even Fabiano Caruana,

03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:22.100
one of the best players in the world

03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:25.460
was on his podcast yesterday basically saying,

03:02:25.460 --> 03:02:27.180
okay, this is beyond my level,

03:02:27.180 --> 03:02:29.340
saying it's out of my league.

03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:30.300
What's out of your league?

03:02:30.300 --> 03:02:31.380
You played for the world championship.

03:02:31.380 --> 03:02:33.700
Kind of we get what we can read between the lines, right?

03:02:33.700 --> 03:02:36.780
Is it possible that Hans is that level of genius?

03:02:36.780 --> 03:02:41.780
Is there like different kinds of genius?

03:02:42.780 --> 03:02:44.580
Like where one,

03:02:44.580 --> 03:02:48.220
you could be out of each other's league kind of thing?

03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:49.140
Maybe.

03:02:49.140 --> 03:02:52.860
In the case of Magnus, it's understanding of end games.

03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:55.260
It's just somehow he understands

03:02:55.260 --> 03:02:57.380
that last phase of the game and the complexities

03:02:57.380 --> 03:02:59.460
and the problems he can pose better than anybody else.

03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:04.460
So you can see Magnus do poor looking moves in the end game.

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.140
Or.

03:03:07.140 --> 03:03:11.340
Like moves that don't fit what your gut says

03:03:11.340 --> 03:03:13.900
would be the optimal.

03:03:13.900 --> 03:03:18.460
Yes, but also, so it's not that you even think they're right.

03:03:18.460 --> 03:03:21.260
You just might not even consider them

03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:23.700
because of over reliance on your own information

03:03:23.700 --> 03:03:24.540
or even the computer.

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:26.820
That was what was going on in game six.

03:03:26.820 --> 03:03:28.580
Just kept doing things and kept playing

03:03:28.620 --> 03:03:31.340
and kept finding play and posing those questions

03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:34.260
that humans and computers could not understand.

03:03:34.260 --> 03:03:36.380
So he beat the engine, basically.

03:03:36.380 --> 03:03:37.820
He wouldn't have beaten the engine

03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:39.340
because they would have defended.

03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:42.700
Jan lost that game in the 90s move psychologically.

03:03:42.700 --> 03:03:43.660
He thought the game was over.

03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:44.500
So that contributed.

03:03:44.500 --> 03:03:45.780
Computer would have defended.

03:03:45.780 --> 03:03:47.860
So by the time this podcast comes out,

03:03:47.860 --> 03:03:49.140
which I don't know, would be in a week

03:03:49.140 --> 03:03:51.900
or something like that, I feel like more will happen.

03:03:52.860 --> 03:03:54.260
Let's see, you're predicting engine.

03:03:54.260 --> 03:03:56.980
How does this Hans drama end?

03:03:56.980 --> 03:03:57.820
Saga.

03:03:58.660 --> 03:04:02.220
Let's look in three months.

03:04:02.220 --> 03:04:04.500
By the time we get to the next world championship,

03:04:04.500 --> 03:04:09.500
let's say, what are the options?

03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:12.420
Let's imagine, let's not say what the probabilities are.

03:04:12.420 --> 03:04:13.500
What are the options?

03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:19.580
Chess.com is forced to or agrees to or whatever

03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:21.180
to come up with a huge amount of evidence

03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:22.500
of cheating in the past.

03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:26.980
Or Hans comes out.

03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:29.660
What can Hans do with this?

03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:32.780
So I'm uncomfortable with the general.

03:04:32.780 --> 03:04:35.180
Make sure you can maybe update me on this.

03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:37.940
But there was a little bit of an attack on him.

03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:41.700
A lot of an attack that he's a cheater, right?

03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:45.020
Without evidence, without clear conclusive evidence.

03:04:45.020 --> 03:04:46.780
Physical evidence.

03:04:46.780 --> 03:04:47.900
Physical evidence.

03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:49.260
So all of those.

03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:50.220
Right.

03:04:50.220 --> 03:04:51.300
That's the tricky thing.

03:04:51.300 --> 03:04:52.180
Yeah.

03:04:52.820 --> 03:04:55.860
So like that stuff we're talking about is beyond my level.

03:04:55.860 --> 03:05:00.860
That starts being kind of intuitive circumstantial evidence.

03:05:01.580 --> 03:05:04.900
There's the statistical evidence

03:05:04.900 --> 03:05:06.780
behind the over the board games

03:05:06.780 --> 03:05:09.580
that he's played in 2020, 2021,

03:05:09.580 --> 03:05:13.500
where the games match what's called engine correlation

03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:17.740
more than Magnus and many other top grandmasters combined.

03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:22.100
But that can be argued is because he was very strong

03:05:23.020 --> 03:05:23.860
in playing weaker opposition.

03:05:23.860 --> 03:05:25.220
So there's always kind of this argument

03:05:25.220 --> 03:05:26.620
against statistics, right?

03:05:26.620 --> 03:05:30.060
There's the fact that the guy who Magnus name dropped,

03:05:30.060 --> 03:05:31.420
Maxim Blugi.

03:05:31.420 --> 03:05:34.180
Blugi is a chess grandmaster.

03:05:34.180 --> 03:05:35.420
And he's even been, I think,

03:05:35.420 --> 03:05:37.060
president of the U.S. Chess Federation.

03:05:37.060 --> 03:05:39.180
I've played him in some blitz games.

03:05:39.180 --> 03:05:41.500
It turns out I wasn't even fully aware

03:05:41.500 --> 03:05:42.340
of the extent of this.

03:05:42.340 --> 03:05:46.260
He has been banned from chess.com for cheating.

03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:49.420
Have they actually, has him and Hans actually worked?

03:05:49.420 --> 03:05:50.340
Yes.

03:05:50.340 --> 03:05:51.820
So that was why he name dropped that, right?

03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:53.620
That's also not good.

03:05:53.620 --> 03:05:55.340
You see where this is getting,

03:05:55.340 --> 03:05:56.740
you still don't have the physical proof,

03:05:56.740 --> 03:05:59.220
but you have smoke.

03:06:00.420 --> 03:06:01.660
So I don't know how this ends.

03:06:01.660 --> 03:06:05.700
I don't know if this, if he denies it to the death

03:06:05.700 --> 03:06:08.940
and he ends up filing some sort of legal action,

03:06:08.940 --> 03:06:11.980
some sort of ethics complaint, or he admits everything.

03:06:14.500 --> 03:06:15.420
I don't know.

03:06:15.420 --> 03:06:17.260
Boy, well, no matter what I hope,

03:06:17.260 --> 03:06:20.460
despite chess or not that he's mentally strong enough

03:06:20.460 --> 03:06:21.980
for whatever is to come.

03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:25.380
That's what I keep saying because I can't imagine, right?

03:06:25.380 --> 03:06:26.980
Like I just, I really can't imagine.

03:06:26.980 --> 03:06:29.060
And maybe we just have too much compassion,

03:06:29.060 --> 03:06:29.900
but I don't think so.

03:06:29.900 --> 03:06:31.260
I really just feel like.

03:06:31.260 --> 03:06:34.300
At the end of the day, chess is just a game,

03:06:34.300 --> 03:06:37.660
but it is a game played by millions of people

03:06:37.660 --> 03:06:39.260
throughout history.

03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:42.380
And nations have basically fought wars

03:06:42.380 --> 03:06:43.420
over the chessboard.

03:06:44.980 --> 03:06:46.860
So like, there's a lot.

03:06:46.860 --> 03:06:47.820
It's like Olympics.

03:06:47.820 --> 03:06:48.980
Olympics is just a little,

03:06:49.300 --> 03:06:50.780
this dude running and so on.

03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:53.580
The hockey is just the thing with the puck.

03:06:53.580 --> 03:06:58.580
But you know, it's also much more than that.

03:06:58.700 --> 03:07:01.540
It's also nations

03:07:03.820 --> 03:07:06.900
sort of figuring out their conflict

03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:09.500
in a way that doesn't involve violence.

03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:11.700
Yeah, it's a serious thing.

03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:16.420
And it's a thing that inspires millions of people.

03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:19.820
And it's a testing ground for intelligent systems

03:07:19.820 --> 03:07:23.820
that eventually take over human civilization.

03:07:25.060 --> 03:07:27.660
Yeah, I mean the bots are really interesting.

03:07:27.660 --> 03:07:28.980
I don't know if there's other lessons.

03:07:28.980 --> 03:07:32.340
Like you played a clone of yourself.

03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:35.900
You watched Stockfish versus Stockfish.

03:07:35.900 --> 03:07:37.620
You have a video.

03:07:37.620 --> 03:07:38.540
People should check out each other.

03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:39.860
You have a lot of awesome videos.

03:07:39.860 --> 03:07:41.980
You have a video titled Stockfish versus Stockfish.

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:43.860
That was the experiment.

03:07:43.860 --> 03:07:45.780
I made them play each other.

03:07:46.620 --> 03:07:48.620
What did you learn from that experiment?

03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:53.300
I enjoyed, first of all, they will always make a draw.

03:07:53.300 --> 03:07:55.340
So engines don't get to play each other

03:07:55.340 --> 03:07:58.380
from a beginning position because they will always draw.

03:07:58.380 --> 03:07:59.940
Especially if they're the same engine.

03:07:59.940 --> 03:08:01.500
So Stockfish 15, Stockfish 15,

03:08:01.500 --> 03:08:05.300
I don't think one side will ever beat the other basically.

03:08:05.300 --> 03:08:08.620
But if you program them to play a certain opening position

03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:10.420
according to chess theory,

03:08:10.420 --> 03:08:13.620
you get to see interesting ways into how they evaluate.

03:08:13.620 --> 03:08:14.460
One of the things,

03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:16.380
one of the ways that it played against the London opening

03:08:16.380 --> 03:08:18.140
was absurd.

03:08:18.140 --> 03:08:20.340
Like it just, it was completely ridiculous.

03:08:20.340 --> 03:08:23.060
Black sacrificed two pawns as early as move six,

03:08:23.060 --> 03:08:26.740
which is a borderline completely lost position.

03:08:26.740 --> 03:08:29.220
And then both sides foresaw that the only way

03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:32.060
white was gonna be able to use that material advantage

03:08:32.060 --> 03:08:35.100
was to give it back and stabilize their own position.

03:08:35.100 --> 03:08:37.580
Like black just got a crazy attack.

03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:40.060
Jesus Christ, this is crazy.

03:08:40.060 --> 03:08:41.340
But they drew them in the end of the drawing.

03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:44.380
So I'm also gonna make them play against each other

03:08:45.300 --> 03:08:47.220
in either bad openings

03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:49.420
or like some of the most popular gambits.

03:08:50.380 --> 03:08:52.380
Looking at something like that.

03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:55.660
And the way I'm gonna do this is basically say

03:08:55.660 --> 03:08:58.340
which chess gambits are the best.

03:08:58.340 --> 03:09:00.100
And the way I'm gonna do that is

03:09:00.100 --> 03:09:03.780
theoretically the engine should be able to beat a gambit.

03:09:03.780 --> 03:09:07.460
Because a gambit is very rarely blessed by the computer.

03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:11.980
So if the computer cannot beat that gambit,

03:09:11.980 --> 03:09:13.580
that means it's good.

03:09:13.580 --> 03:09:14.420
That means it's not losing.

03:09:14.420 --> 03:09:17.340
If it's a completely lost gambit, it will beat it.

03:09:17.340 --> 03:09:21.300
But if it draws despite getting that early disadvantage,

03:09:21.300 --> 03:09:23.180
then that means the gambit is very reliable

03:09:23.180 --> 03:09:24.460
and you can play it.

03:09:24.460 --> 03:09:27.660
So that's a good way to evaluate opening games.

03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:29.180
Yeah.

03:09:29.180 --> 03:09:31.460
What's the best, what's your favorite opening?

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:36.020
Or what openings do you like?

03:09:36.020 --> 03:09:39.780
There was an opening that got me back into chess

03:09:39.780 --> 03:09:40.620
when I was 15.

03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:41.820
I had quit for like three years

03:09:41.820 --> 03:09:43.100
and I went to my friend's house

03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:46.660
and he had a book by Lars Skandorf,

03:09:46.660 --> 03:09:49.580
a Danish grandmaster called The Karokan Defense,

03:09:49.580 --> 03:09:51.860
which is C6.

03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:53.540
Do you want white or do you want black?

03:09:53.540 --> 03:09:55.060
Do you want to show the opening?

03:09:55.060 --> 03:09:56.380
This is the opening.

03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:57.220
The Karokan Defense.

03:09:57.220 --> 03:09:58.460
So you play E4, I play C6.

03:09:58.460 --> 03:10:00.220
I have to play black.

03:10:00.220 --> 03:10:01.060
That's it.

03:10:01.060 --> 03:10:03.660
Yeah, and we develop from here.

03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:05.700
I put my default.

03:10:05.700 --> 03:10:07.100
What counts as an opening?

03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:10.780
Okay, but the development, does the development matter?

03:10:10.780 --> 03:10:11.660
Yeah, so from here,

03:10:11.660 --> 03:10:14.380
the development goes into the variations of the Karokan.

03:10:14.380 --> 03:10:16.380
So this is the Karokan.

03:10:16.380 --> 03:10:17.860
Like you can be in a city,

03:10:17.860 --> 03:10:19.660
but then you can be in neighborhoods.

03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:21.900
That's a very non-dramatic, okay.

03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:23.020
Yeah.

03:10:23.020 --> 03:10:24.180
Two pawns in the center.

03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:26.020
So that's called the Breyer variation.

03:10:26.020 --> 03:10:28.340
So what's a good thing for me?

03:10:28.340 --> 03:10:29.180
Two squares, yeah.

03:10:29.180 --> 03:10:31.380
If you can put two pawns in the center, yeah, you should.

03:10:31.380 --> 03:10:32.220
And then-

03:10:32.220 --> 03:10:33.040
So that's a good thing.

03:10:33.040 --> 03:10:34.540
Yes, and then I will go here

03:10:34.540 --> 03:10:36.100
and now you have to decide what you're gonna do

03:10:36.100 --> 03:10:37.860
with your center pawn.

03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:40.300
You can push, take, or defend it.

03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:43.620
And push, take, or defend, right?

03:10:43.620 --> 03:10:44.460
Yeah.

03:10:44.460 --> 03:10:45.860
What would you suggest?

03:10:45.860 --> 03:10:47.420
Take is the worst?

03:10:47.420 --> 03:10:49.500
Take is just stable, so we just trade,

03:10:49.500 --> 03:10:51.980
but pushing is considered the best.

03:10:51.980 --> 03:10:55.020
Advancing and taking my space away from me.

03:10:55.020 --> 03:10:57.060
So I think alpha zero or stockfish

03:10:57.060 --> 03:10:59.260
would probably always push.

03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:00.100
Push.

03:11:00.100 --> 03:11:02.580
And now there's something called like

03:11:02.580 --> 03:11:04.060
the main line or the sideline.

03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:05.540
Main line is what's the most popular,

03:11:05.540 --> 03:11:08.180
played at all levels, which is moving the bishop here.

03:11:08.180 --> 03:11:09.560
I've played this a lot.

03:11:09.560 --> 03:11:12.880
But for beginners and intermediate players,

03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:14.640
this is why I love this opening so much.

03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:17.560
On move three, black already has a plus score,

03:11:17.560 --> 03:11:20.000
which is crazy.

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:21.440
It's not supposed to happen.

03:11:21.440 --> 03:11:24.520
And there's this very tricky second most popular move,

03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:25.840
which is undermining your center,

03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:27.840
trying to get you to take my free pawn,

03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:31.200
but destabilize and leave both of them kind of hanging.

03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:32.040
And-

03:11:32.040 --> 03:11:34.440
Is that why the plus score?

03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:37.880
Is it because you're susceptible to the destabilization?

03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:42.040
Yes, because people at 99% of the rating ladder

03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:45.480
do not understand how to deal with what's coming basically.

03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:49.020
They don't know how to deal with a structural attack.

03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:51.880
So would stockfish try to defend the pawn here

03:11:51.880 --> 03:11:52.720
and keep the structure?

03:11:52.720 --> 03:11:54.640
No, it would take the pawn and tell you to go fuck yourself.

03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:55.480
Oh.

03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:56.960
I knew that.

03:11:56.960 --> 03:11:58.240
Cause I am 3,400.

03:11:58.240 --> 03:11:59.080
Right.

03:11:59.080 --> 03:12:02.040
It would take the pawn and be like, all right, win it back.

03:12:02.040 --> 03:12:03.920
And even if you did, you would suffer.

03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:05.600
It would make you win it back in the most annoying way.

03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:08.400
It would make you tie your shoes together and block-

03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:10.960
So I, like as stockfish, I would take-

03:12:10.960 --> 03:12:11.800
Yes.

03:12:11.800 --> 03:12:12.880
That's the best move.

03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:13.720
That's the best move.

03:12:13.720 --> 03:12:18.040
But not at 99% of the rating ladder, which is funny.

03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:18.880
Interesting.

03:12:21.160 --> 03:12:23.160
Bo, you like to play this.

03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:24.780
I play this against GMs.

03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:25.620
I play both.

03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:26.460
I move my bishop.

03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:27.400
I push-

03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:29.400
What are the different ways it evolves?

03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:30.740
Like then the rest doesn't matter.

03:12:30.740 --> 03:12:33.640
So this is just like a pawn structure thing.

03:12:33.640 --> 03:12:34.480
Yeah.

03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:35.320
And I mean-

03:12:36.160 --> 03:12:37.400
I keep our most openings.

03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:39.120
So it's anywhere from like two moves

03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:40.440
to like 10 moves kind of thing.

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:43.040
Yeah. You can be out of theory very, very quickly.

03:12:43.040 --> 03:12:44.160
Two move, two move, three.

03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:46.520
Like basically on your own, you have a general idea,

03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:47.680
but you don't remember games.

03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:51.040
I mean, I know KaroKan games from start to finish

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:53.280
because I've played it since 2011.

03:12:53.280 --> 03:12:54.720
So you know all the different branches

03:12:54.720 --> 03:12:55.640
that goes with that down.

03:12:55.640 --> 03:12:58.960
Yeah. I think I know every opening in chess, basically.

03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:02.640
I think most, most title players know every opening,

03:13:02.640 --> 03:13:05.360
but we don't know, we can't play it competitively

03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:06.880
because we would be, but-

03:13:06.880 --> 03:13:08.920
What are some of the weirder openings

03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:13.920
that like slightly suboptimal,

03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:16.120
but might be explored?

03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:19.640
Like Magnus might play them

03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:21.200
just to fuck with the opponent.

03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:23.600
He played something recently actually

03:13:23.600 --> 03:13:26.600
against this German prodigy, Vincent Keimer,

03:13:26.600 --> 03:13:31.240
which was a specific move order

03:13:31.240 --> 03:13:33.320
in a very popular opening.

03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:34.480
So it was basically a position

03:13:34.480 --> 03:13:36.240
that had been reached thousands of times,

03:13:36.240 --> 03:13:39.800
but the move order Magnus chose with white

03:13:39.800 --> 03:13:43.760
was played maybe 0.05% of the time,

03:13:43.760 --> 03:13:46.000
which is crazy, thousands of games.

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:47.680
And it's supposed to be not good,

03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:49.800
meaning it allows black to equalize

03:13:49.800 --> 03:13:51.800
because that's what black is going for.

03:13:51.800 --> 03:13:53.760
Not winning the game, but equalizing

03:13:53.760 --> 03:13:55.200
because you go second.

03:13:55.200 --> 03:13:57.320
Magnus says, I don't care about equalizing.

03:13:57.320 --> 03:13:58.160
I just want a position.

03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:01.560
I don't want my opponent to know the answers to the test.

03:14:03.120 --> 03:14:04.680
That's so interesting.

03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:06.600
Cause also fucks you psychologically,

03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:09.680
it throws you off and just always keep you on your toes.

03:14:09.680 --> 03:14:10.840
He's in a weird position,

03:14:10.840 --> 03:14:13.800
but he also has the advantage of being able to intimidate.

03:14:14.800 --> 03:14:16.280
I wonder how many people,

03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:19.240
how much is that a role of it,

03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:21.360
like being scared of the other person?

03:14:21.360 --> 03:14:22.720
It's a huge role, I think.

03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:24.320
I think some of the top guys would deny it,

03:14:24.320 --> 03:14:27.280
but you know when you're in the seventh hour

03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:29.160
and you're playing Magnus,

03:14:29.160 --> 03:14:31.560
it's a very different feeling than some of the other.

03:14:31.560 --> 03:14:33.440
When Magnus is messing around in the opening,

03:14:33.440 --> 03:14:35.560
it's very different than another person

03:14:35.560 --> 03:14:36.680
messing around in the opening.

03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:41.680
You just kind of like expect for something to be there.

03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:44.600
We'll see if it translates to poker for him,

03:14:44.600 --> 03:14:46.200
but I think he gets a little bit,

03:14:46.200 --> 03:14:47.840
maybe less respect in the poker world.

03:14:47.840 --> 03:14:49.160
In the chess world, he's sort of alpha.

03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:50.240
He gets a lot of respect.

03:14:50.240 --> 03:14:51.720
I just talked to Daniel Negrano,

03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:55.160
he gets the only person that doesn't respect

03:14:55.160 --> 03:14:56.320
Magnus Carlsen.

03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:00.240
Honestly, either in chess or poker is Magnus Carlsen.

03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:01.560
I was gonna say Hans Niemann.

03:15:01.560 --> 03:15:03.440
That's true.

03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:05.720
But like Magnus is hilarious.

03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:07.120
I mean, when he talks about his rating,

03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:08.440
he's like, it was pretty good.

03:15:08.440 --> 03:15:11.760
When he talks about how good he is at poker, I suck.

03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:15.040
But you know, I think that self-critical view,

03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:19.040
I think he honestly believes to a degree

03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:22.240
is probably part of the engine that fuels him

03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:23.800
to get better and better and better and better.

03:15:23.800 --> 03:15:26.320
Yeah, but what I'm saying is if you're face to face

03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:27.240
with Magnus at a chess board,

03:15:27.240 --> 03:15:29.480
it's not the same as being in a nine handed poker table

03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:30.320
with him.

03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:31.280
You kind of keep an eye on him maybe

03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:32.760
and then he's a mysterious guy,

03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:36.160
but chess is different because you're like this is the man.

03:15:36.160 --> 03:15:37.800
Yeah, there's very few people.

03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:41.120
Yeah, so in poker, they talk about Phil Ivey that way.

03:15:41.120 --> 03:15:41.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:15:41.960 --> 03:15:43.440
As like this super intimidating.

03:15:43.440 --> 03:15:48.440
I think that's, it's probably harder

03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:49.920
to intimidate in poker.

03:15:51.560 --> 03:15:52.600
Actually, I don't know.

03:15:52.600 --> 03:15:53.440
I don't know.

03:15:54.080 --> 03:15:57.720
There's something intimidating about like excellence

03:15:57.720 --> 03:16:00.720
in a deterministic game that's just terrifying.

03:16:00.720 --> 03:16:03.800
Like you're, I mean, it's like playing stockfish.

03:16:03.800 --> 03:16:06.400
Like you're fucked.

03:16:06.400 --> 03:16:08.600
This thing will suffocate you.

03:16:09.440 --> 03:16:11.400
And especially when it makes moves

03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:13.280
that you don't understand.

03:16:13.280 --> 03:16:15.360
This, to me, the most beautiful thing honestly

03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:19.360
is the sacrifices that the engines do.

03:16:20.480 --> 03:16:23.240
Just the, it's such a fuck you.

03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:26.720
Like I could sacrifice pieces and I'll get them back

03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:28.840
and I'll get them back more and I could look.

03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:30.080
I don't even have to get them back.

03:16:30.080 --> 03:16:31.480
Your position is so bad.

03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:32.680
I gave you full material

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:34.560
and there's nothing you can do about it, yeah.

03:16:34.560 --> 03:16:35.840
That's terrifying.

03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:36.680
Yeah.

03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:37.520
That's terrifying.

03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:40.720
That's like, and that transfers to AI systems in general,

03:16:40.720 --> 03:16:45.720
like a system that plays weak just to fool you.

03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:48.080
Just to fool you.

03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:55.800
For people who are trying to get better at chess,

03:16:55.800 --> 03:16:58.840
beginners or at any stage of their development,

03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:01.320
what advice would you give about getting better?

03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:05.120
Except watch your channel.

03:17:05.120 --> 03:17:06.760
Yeah, of course, watch my videos.

03:17:06.760 --> 03:17:08.120
Check out chessly.com.

03:17:08.120 --> 03:17:10.320
That's where I'm gonna scale the courses to.

03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:14.000
But no, on a serious note,

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:17.800
you have to be prepared to lose way more than win.

03:17:17.800 --> 03:17:22.720
My mom gave me advice when I was maybe 13 or 14

03:17:22.720 --> 03:17:26.240
and I just discovered that I liked girls.

03:17:26.240 --> 03:17:28.880
She said, you're gonna get a lot more nos in life

03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:29.720
than yeses.

03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:33.080
That even happened with my wife actually.

03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:35.840
Our whole journey is quite fascinating.

03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:37.440
It's paved with rejection.

03:17:37.440 --> 03:17:41.720
Paved with, yes, various ghostings over the course of years

03:17:41.720 --> 03:17:43.840
but we got married and we love each other very much

03:17:44.680 --> 03:17:49.680
so it's a wonderful tale but it's the same in chess.

03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:53.040
You're gonna lose a lot and you have to be,

03:17:53.040 --> 03:17:55.240
for adults, I noticed,

03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:56.720
kids and adults learn chess very differently.

03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:59.440
Kids yell out in class and they're very excited

03:17:59.440 --> 03:18:00.520
and they don't realize how many times

03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:01.960
they get something wrong.

03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:04.800
Adults never wanna talk during lessons

03:18:04.800 --> 03:18:06.200
because they're afraid of being wrong.

03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:08.360
Adults will preface correct answers with,

03:18:08.360 --> 03:18:11.080
this is probably wrong but shut up.

03:18:11.080 --> 03:18:13.960
You're paying for a private lesson.

03:18:13.960 --> 03:18:16.160
This is the place to be wrong.

03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.200
So adults especially think that being dominant

03:18:19.200 --> 03:18:21.560
in a career where they've dedicated

03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:23.880
a lot of their brain power and a lot of their work ethic

03:18:23.880 --> 03:18:25.000
and a lot of their study time,

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:26.200
it's gonna translate to chess.

03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:27.480
They do it to their own kids.

03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:28.560
They helicopter their own kids

03:18:28.560 --> 03:18:31.600
because they try to apply a lot of the same stuff.

03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:34.560
Studying chess is different than studying anything else.

03:18:34.560 --> 03:18:35.400
Anything else.

03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:39.240
Same could be argued for martial arts I guess but.

03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:40.120
Yeah, 100%.

03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:41.360
You have to have a beginner's mind

03:18:41.360 --> 03:18:43.240
and what that actually means is

03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:45.240
sucking in every aspect of the game

03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:49.320
and studying all the interesting ways in which you suck.

03:18:49.320 --> 03:18:51.840
And you will realize you get better

03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:53.400
without actually trying to get better.

03:18:53.400 --> 03:18:54.800
I show up to the boxing gym one day

03:18:54.800 --> 03:18:56.280
and move my hips better.

03:18:56.280 --> 03:18:58.240
And I would do shadow boxing.

03:18:58.240 --> 03:19:00.320
Sensei goes, you're moving your feet better today.

03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:01.160
You got better.

03:19:01.160 --> 03:19:02.680
I'm like, I didn't practice footwork.

03:19:02.680 --> 03:19:05.480
Your brain just starts putting it all together randomly.

03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:08.240
You might study a shit load and still lose 100 points.

03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:10.800
If you're gonna study chess, Owen, for fuck's sake,

03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:14.200
this is the only activity where people go in going,

03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:16.600
how much do I have to work to be a grandmaster?

03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:18.600
Nowhere else in my life have I ever seen someone

03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:21.960
try to pick up a hobby and wanna be the top ranking level.

03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:23.400
Only in chess.

03:19:23.400 --> 03:19:26.120
You're right but like for example,

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:28.280
when I like grappling sports,

03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:30.800
I'll see people come to a gym

03:19:30.800 --> 03:19:32.120
and basically ask like,

03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:35.800
how long before I can get into the UFC, right?

03:19:35.800 --> 03:19:38.000
But UFC champion is different.

03:19:38.640 --> 03:19:41.600
Grandmaster is equivalent to getting into the UFC.

03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:44.480
I guess, yeah.

03:19:44.480 --> 03:19:48.480
But people quickly realize when like the 110 pound girl

03:19:48.480 --> 03:19:51.400
taps them out over and over and they're a 230 pound

03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:55.600
like ripped dude, they realize like,

03:19:55.600 --> 03:19:58.200
okay, this is an art, this is a journey.

03:19:58.200 --> 03:20:01.280
And I think if you resist the lessons

03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:03.440
that failure teaches you, that's when you don't grow.

03:20:03.440 --> 03:20:06.360
So like, just relax.

03:20:06.400 --> 03:20:08.120
One of the things you have to learn

03:20:08.120 --> 03:20:09.920
probably applies to chess too,

03:20:09.920 --> 03:20:13.360
is to know how to relax your body, your mind.

03:20:13.360 --> 03:20:16.520
And just like, there's something about,

03:20:16.520 --> 03:20:18.480
just like you said, like,

03:20:18.480 --> 03:20:21.280
if you don't resist it, if you relax,

03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:24.680
then your body, your mind will learn the way of this game.

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:31.000
And probably add to that is just put a lot of hours in

03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:32.240
of having fun.

03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:36.720
But then I, on that perpetual chess podcast,

03:20:36.720 --> 03:20:38.880
I listened to somebody that say like,

03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:40.520
it doesn't like puzzles, none of that.

03:20:40.520 --> 03:20:43.160
What matters is the number of hours you spend

03:20:43.160 --> 03:20:47.080
kind of suffering, meaning like thinking deeply,

03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:50.240
like count like, like straining,

03:20:50.240 --> 03:20:52.920
like thinking with your mind, like really working hard.

03:20:52.920 --> 03:20:56.480
So, and then, you know, you have the Magnus who says,

03:20:56.480 --> 03:20:58.240
no, what matters is the number of hours

03:20:58.240 --> 03:20:59.400
you spend having fun.

03:21:00.400 --> 03:21:02.520
Yeah, it's a mix, it's a mix.

03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:04.960
He's right, I don't quite agree with suffering,

03:21:04.960 --> 03:21:07.760
but I think people do a lot of fake learning.

03:21:07.760 --> 03:21:12.080
They play speed games, they just go through tactics.

03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:13.840
So, okay, I have to do 20 tactics.

03:21:13.840 --> 03:21:16.400
Okay, boop, wrong, next one.

03:21:16.400 --> 03:21:21.280
I used to tell my students, you need to do 10 puzzles

03:21:21.280 --> 03:21:23.440
and you need to get 100% correct.

03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:25.240
I don't care how long it takes.

03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:28.760
So I suppose that kind of is like the suffering theory,

03:21:28.840 --> 03:21:33.080
but if you do 30 puzzles and you get eight correct,

03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:35.200
what even is that?

03:21:35.200 --> 03:21:40.200
That's laughable in the correct amount of, you know,

03:21:40.200 --> 03:21:44.760
it was 29%, I don't know, but 26%, it's, you can't do that.

03:21:44.760 --> 03:21:46.120
You have to get things right

03:21:46.120 --> 03:21:47.320
and that's the only way you're actually-

03:21:47.320 --> 03:21:48.800
And that requires like thinking deeply

03:21:48.800 --> 03:21:49.880
and like really struggling,

03:21:49.880 --> 03:21:51.960
like especially if you're doing the puzzles at the level

03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:54.360
that that's your level.

03:21:54.360 --> 03:21:57.200
I've done a puzzle for an hour before

03:21:57.200 --> 03:21:58.840
because I was so stubborn.

03:21:58.840 --> 03:22:00.720
I didn't want to just put in a wrong answer.

03:22:00.720 --> 03:22:03.960
Yeah, the guy I was listening to said like, that's good.

03:22:03.960 --> 03:22:04.800
You should do that.

03:22:04.800 --> 03:22:06.880
Maybe for me and the same with blindfold chess,

03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:09.560
I have to say, like my blindfold skills, I never practice.

03:22:09.560 --> 03:22:11.880
I just, I can visualize the board quite well.

03:22:11.880 --> 03:22:16.200
I've played, at most I've played four games blindfolded

03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:17.280
at the same time.

03:22:17.280 --> 03:22:19.720
That sucks, that just feels horrible in the brain afterward,

03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:23.280
but like I can play four simultaneous games.

03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:24.120
Blindfolded.

03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:24.940
Yeah.

03:22:24.940 --> 03:22:25.840
What's that take to do that?

03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:26.680
I don't know.

03:22:26.760 --> 03:22:27.720
I get asked that all the time.

03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:28.560
How do I practice?

03:22:28.560 --> 03:22:31.160
Why the fuck would you do that, dude?

03:22:31.160 --> 03:22:32.000
There's no need.

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:32.920
It's a good party trick.

03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:34.240
It is, yes.

03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:35.080
It is.

03:22:35.080 --> 03:22:37.560
The video of Magnus doing it in Columbus Circle on YouTube

03:22:37.560 --> 03:22:40.160
has like, I don't know how many views.

03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.000
I did it live with an announcer.

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:43.600
I can't imagine how chaotic that was,

03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:46.720
but yeah, it's a great party trick.

03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:47.760
Yeah.

03:22:47.760 --> 03:22:51.400
Oh, there is a Reddit thing I forgot to ask Magnus

03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:53.360
that they asked me to ask him

03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:55.240
because they moved the wrong piece.

03:22:55.240 --> 03:22:56.360
Yes.

03:22:57.040 --> 03:22:57.880
And then somehow he remembered.

03:22:57.880 --> 03:23:00.640
I don't know how that happened, I have to tell you.

03:23:00.640 --> 03:23:03.960
I kind of presume that he figured out

03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:05.920
from the way the other person was moving

03:23:05.920 --> 03:23:07.880
that they moved the wrong piece.

03:23:07.880 --> 03:23:09.360
Yeah, I forgot to ask him that.

03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:10.200
Yeah.

03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:11.040
Why did I forget?

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:12.360
I mean, my memory sucks.

03:23:14.280 --> 03:23:18.800
You said, you know, ups and downs in your childhood,

03:23:18.800 --> 03:23:20.040
a little rough sometimes.

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.040
Also, you get attacked by the beautiful,

03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:24.720
wonderful people on the internet.

03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:25.560
Sure.

03:23:25.600 --> 03:23:26.600
It's difficult.

03:23:26.600 --> 03:23:29.320
What's been the lowest point

03:23:29.320 --> 03:23:31.280
that you've ever gone to in your mind?

03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:35.000
In my career and my life.

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.760
In your life, in your career and everything, your mind.

03:23:37.760 --> 03:23:40.160
So have you ever been depressed?

03:23:41.240 --> 03:23:43.400
For sure, yes.

03:23:43.400 --> 03:23:46.600
How did you, like if you can remember moments,

03:23:46.600 --> 03:23:48.800
how did you overcome that?

03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:53.480
Well, I will share two anecdotes.

03:23:54.040 --> 03:23:59.040
When I was May 2012, so I was 16 and a half

03:24:02.120 --> 03:24:07.120
and I was living in a household situation

03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:14.160
where I thought nobody knew what was going on basically

03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:18.760
without sharing obviously extremely personal details,

03:24:18.760 --> 03:24:20.360
like what was going on except me.

03:24:21.360 --> 03:24:24.400
And I confided in my grandmother.

03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:29.960
I was, imagine living in a house

03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:31.920
where you basically feel like a prisoner,

03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:33.800
you don't wanna interact with anybody in the house,

03:24:33.800 --> 03:24:36.240
you don't know how you're supposed to bring these things up.

03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:38.360
Of course, this sounds extremely vague

03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:41.480
and I just don't, I don't feel like exposing

03:24:41.480 --> 03:24:43.760
all of my entire family drama to the audience,

03:24:43.760 --> 03:24:48.480
but I lived this way for probably something like

03:24:48.880 --> 03:24:51.160
eight months, I don't know, something ridiculous.

03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:52.840
It was the junior year of high school.

03:24:52.840 --> 03:24:54.920
So I was supposed to take my SATs.

03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:57.240
That was the year I was supposed to finish up

03:24:57.240 --> 03:24:58.480
my portfolio for college,

03:24:58.480 --> 03:25:00.760
because you only get really a few months of senior year

03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:01.600
to start applying.

03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:04.400
It was a nightmare, complete nightmare.

03:25:04.400 --> 03:25:08.000
And I don't know how I got through it.

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:11.040
Time went by, I listened to sad music

03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:13.000
and tried to spend as little time as home as possible.

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.480
I would pretend to fall asleep at my friend's houses

03:25:15.480 --> 03:25:17.920
so that my mom was like, are you coming for dinner?

03:25:18.360 --> 03:25:20.280
And I would just pretend to be asleep.

03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:21.960
So it was just a grind.

03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:23.600
Yeah, yeah, it was a grind.

03:25:23.600 --> 03:25:26.280
I don't remember a whole lot from that period,

03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:30.080
just sort of finding what made me happy

03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:32.560
and trying to focus on it.

03:25:32.560 --> 03:25:33.840
And I was a teenager in the house,

03:25:33.840 --> 03:25:36.000
I wasn't gonna run away, I still had a roof over my head,

03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:39.720
so I'm not saying I had it better or worse than others,

03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:41.320
I just had it different.

03:25:41.320 --> 03:25:44.920
And actually recently, this is much more wrong in my memory,

03:25:45.480 --> 03:25:50.480
I more or less tore up a very happy life my wife and I had.

03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:58.120
And I've talked about this in bursts on stream,

03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:03.120
but essentially what happened was we had just been living in,

03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:07.320
it's actually funny,

03:26:07.320 --> 03:26:09.840
the way we got into this apartment was also very bad,

03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:13.160
but we were living in just a very nice little apartment,

03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:14.680
like high-rise apartment, safe,

03:26:14.680 --> 03:26:16.000
and the reason we moved into a high-rise

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.240
was because we had lived in a house for two weeks

03:26:18.240 --> 03:26:19.920
that got broken into.

03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:21.800
Not because of who I am,

03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:25.200
but because we suspect we had people moving in mattresses

03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:28.040
and they went, oh shit, these two people live here?

03:26:28.040 --> 03:26:29.400
That's it?

03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:31.600
And basically there was three apartments,

03:26:31.600 --> 03:26:35.320
my upstairs neighbor let in somebody that they didn't expect

03:26:35.320 --> 03:26:37.520
and the guy cracked our door open with a crowbar.

03:26:37.520 --> 03:26:39.680
Thank God that was the first day in two years

03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:40.720
my wife went to work.

03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:43.080
Did they know?

03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:44.840
Did they not know?

03:26:44.840 --> 03:26:45.680
I don't know.

03:26:45.680 --> 03:26:46.760
Everything happens for a reason.

03:26:47.760 --> 03:26:49.080
So nobody got hurt.

03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:50.160
Nobody got hurt, yeah.

03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:54.320
They stole some couple of important things,

03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:57.360
but nobody was hurt and the cops did nothing.

03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:02.680
So you moved into a high-rise in New York?

03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:06.120
Yeah, in New York for safety and we're away from things

03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:08.640
and we have our own nice little nook.

03:27:08.640 --> 03:27:10.600
And somewhere, some months into it,

03:27:10.600 --> 03:27:14.920
I started hearing noises from above, our neighbors.

03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:17.600
And it started in the morning, 7 a.m.,

03:27:17.600 --> 03:27:22.480
it started in the afternoon and I picked up on it

03:27:22.480 --> 03:27:25.480
and I expected it every day for weeks.

03:27:26.400 --> 03:27:28.760
Then it was driving me crazy and I was like,

03:27:28.760 --> 03:27:30.400
okay, we're gonna go have a civil conversation

03:27:30.400 --> 03:27:33.240
with whoever's up there, sounds like kids.

03:27:33.240 --> 03:27:35.840
So we go knock, lady gas lit the shit out of us.

03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:37.200
I've never been gas lit that hard in my life.

03:27:37.200 --> 03:27:38.520
She went, noise, what noise?

03:27:38.520 --> 03:27:41.480
It's probably our other neighbor who's a boxer.

03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:45.640
Lady, you have kids, we can hear you through the vents.

03:27:45.640 --> 03:27:47.640
Hear you talking to your kids.

03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:49.560
Went to the front desk of the building, they did nothing.

03:27:49.560 --> 03:27:51.040
Went to the leasing office, they did nothing.

03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:53.480
And basically over time, I just let this drive me nuts.

03:27:53.480 --> 03:27:56.280
It was back to the stubbornness thing.

03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:59.280
I decided we were leaving.

03:27:59.280 --> 03:28:01.520
We were going to live somewhere, there was no noise.

03:28:01.520 --> 03:28:02.960
Because we can't beat these people,

03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:05.120
there's nothing we can do, right?

03:28:05.120 --> 03:28:08.440
And my wife, I dragged her around

03:28:08.440 --> 03:28:09.520
to a bunch of different viewings.

03:28:09.520 --> 03:28:13.600
I was dead sad, I decided I was completely miserable.

03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:17.200
And we found a house to rent, like a nice house.

03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:18.600
Family had just moved away.

03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:21.920
House, standalone house, not gonna have neighbors.

03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:24.880
But wife decided that, not wife decided,

03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:27.560
we decided that it's too big, it's too big for,

03:28:27.560 --> 03:28:28.380
so we're gonna get a dog.

03:28:28.380 --> 03:28:31.760
We always wanted an animal, so we're gonna get a dog.

03:28:31.760 --> 03:28:33.680
So we get an absolute lunatic puppy

03:28:33.680 --> 03:28:35.840
who just doesn't let us sleep at all.

03:28:35.840 --> 03:28:37.160
This is on top of everything else,

03:28:37.160 --> 03:28:39.160
the mental health crisis that's going on.

03:28:39.160 --> 03:28:41.480
And the day we are moving to this house,

03:28:42.480 --> 03:28:44.200
I realize I fuck up.

03:28:44.200 --> 03:28:47.360
Like I realize that this whole thing was in my head

03:28:47.360 --> 03:28:49.120
and I don't wanna leave.

03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:50.480
I don't wanna leave.

03:28:50.480 --> 03:28:52.560
This could have all been avoided.

03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:55.280
And the guilt and, I didn't wanna exist.

03:28:55.280 --> 03:28:57.400
Like it's not that I, it wasn't suicide,

03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:59.360
but you know the feeling of just,

03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:02.520
you want to just observe yourself from a distance.

03:29:02.520 --> 03:29:04.120
And I couldn't sleep.

03:29:04.120 --> 03:29:05.760
I thought my wife was gonna leave me.

03:29:05.760 --> 03:29:06.800
Like this is the way.

03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:07.920
And that's what anxiety does.

03:29:07.920 --> 03:29:10.640
It also takes everything you feel to an absolute dread.

03:29:10.640 --> 03:29:15.640
And that I experienced for a good chunk of two weeks.

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:18.600
And then we kind of settled down and decided like,

03:29:18.600 --> 03:29:19.440
we're gonna live.

03:29:19.440 --> 03:29:20.260
Did you tell her about it?

03:29:20.260 --> 03:29:21.920
Like, were you able to talk through it?

03:29:21.920 --> 03:29:25.160
Yeah, yeah, I, yeah.

03:29:25.160 --> 03:29:27.200
Does she know the levels of madness

03:29:27.200 --> 03:29:28.600
that could be inside your mind?

03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:29.520
I don't know if she'll ever know,

03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:32.000
but I tried to tell her that, and.

03:29:32.200 --> 03:29:34.840
I'm not sure you'll ever know.

03:29:34.840 --> 03:29:36.360
That's kind of the point.

03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:38.960
Yeah, I try to, that's why I try to keep busy.

03:29:38.960 --> 03:29:40.720
But that was the darkest that got.

03:29:40.720 --> 03:29:43.000
And yet through all of that, I went on stream every day.

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:44.360
I made YouTube videos every day.

03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:46.640
Like I understood that I had a job to do.

03:29:46.640 --> 03:29:49.320
And I did it and I talked about it here and there.

03:29:49.320 --> 03:29:51.360
But that was the worst that ever got

03:29:51.360 --> 03:29:56.360
because I'm learning that the emotions I experience

03:29:58.040 --> 03:30:01.960
are guilt, remorse, and your brain just goes in circles

03:30:02.920 --> 03:30:04.400
basically about things that you've done or haven't done.

03:30:04.400 --> 03:30:07.440
It's funny because noise can do that also.

03:30:07.440 --> 03:30:10.640
So the noise was real, but it was building in your head.

03:30:10.640 --> 03:30:11.480
Yeah.

03:30:13.160 --> 03:30:17.360
So I tried to, I actually, it's kind of funny

03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:18.840
because I like to focus deeply.

03:30:18.840 --> 03:30:21.160
And I'll have like sources of noise.

03:30:21.160 --> 03:30:23.360
I've tried to teach myself over time.

03:30:23.360 --> 03:30:25.920
I'll go to like coffee shops and stuff to like,

03:30:25.920 --> 03:30:27.960
I like, I almost try to put myself

03:30:27.960 --> 03:30:31.320
next to annoying situations so I get like trained.

03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:33.200
Maybe I should do that.

03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:36.040
But it's, at a certain point, at the same time,

03:30:36.040 --> 03:30:38.080
I've gotten to hang out with certain people,

03:30:38.080 --> 03:30:41.200
especially in LA, they're like in the middle of nowhere,

03:30:41.200 --> 03:30:44.640
like in Malibu or something, and it's like that quiet.

03:30:44.640 --> 03:30:45.840
Can you hear your ears ringing?

03:30:45.840 --> 03:30:46.880
It's so quiet.

03:30:46.880 --> 03:30:47.880
Basically. Yeah.

03:30:47.880 --> 03:30:50.480
And it's like, holy shit, this is a good way

03:30:50.480 --> 03:30:52.840
if you want to write something or create something.

03:30:52.840 --> 03:30:54.640
This is like super quiet.

03:30:54.640 --> 03:30:57.080
So my mom does, my mom's a science,

03:30:57.080 --> 03:30:58.280
journalist, science author.

03:30:58.280 --> 03:31:00.480
She just published her first book actually

03:31:00.560 --> 03:31:03.120
on poop of all things, yeah.

03:31:03.120 --> 03:31:05.680
Fecal, the waste management.

03:31:05.680 --> 03:31:07.720
It was actually a very fascinating concept

03:31:07.720 --> 03:31:09.200
and look through history.

03:31:09.200 --> 03:31:10.240
And she would do that.

03:31:10.240 --> 03:31:12.400
She goes to complete solitude.

03:31:12.400 --> 03:31:14.680
And she writes, yeah.

03:31:14.680 --> 03:31:15.520
It's beautiful.

03:31:15.520 --> 03:31:16.600
No sirens.

03:31:16.600 --> 03:31:17.920
I mean, New York is the opposite of that.

03:31:17.920 --> 03:31:20.360
So, you know, it's, you've brought it,

03:31:22.680 --> 03:31:24.360
you brought it on yourself.

03:31:24.360 --> 03:31:26.240
I've lived there for 20 years.

03:31:27.160 --> 03:31:29.440
Has it been tough like going on stream

03:31:29.440 --> 03:31:31.960
to put on the face of happiness through that?

03:31:31.960 --> 03:31:33.040
Yeah.

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:38.040
Yes, but I find my ways to have moments

03:31:38.160 --> 03:31:39.480
where I can talk about it.

03:31:39.480 --> 03:31:42.680
If it's on a stream, I don't get 10,000 live viewers.

03:31:42.680 --> 03:31:43.520
So it's very different.

03:31:43.520 --> 03:31:47.880
It's, if I stream late night, I get 1,500, 2,000 viewers.

03:31:47.880 --> 03:31:50.640
I used to care a lot more about viewers on stream,

03:31:50.640 --> 03:31:52.840
but I've basically invested fully in YouTube.

03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:54.760
So that's kind of the way.

03:31:54.760 --> 03:31:56.920
And I think, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,

03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:01.000
but I think people appreciate the human being

03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:04.040
behind the chess streamer.

03:32:04.040 --> 03:32:05.280
I think so.

03:32:05.280 --> 03:32:06.120
I think so.

03:32:06.120 --> 03:32:08.600
I think a lot of people, not in the chess world,

03:32:08.600 --> 03:32:11.480
but just a lot of people, they put on a persona

03:32:11.480 --> 03:32:13.400
and just in general, social media is the highlights

03:32:13.400 --> 03:32:15.280
of your life or the low lies,

03:32:15.280 --> 03:32:17.480
just as long as they're dramatic.

03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:21.040
But I've tried, I try to be very open and honest.

03:32:21.040 --> 03:32:22.240
When I'm tired, I'm tired.

03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:24.880
It's what makes my recaps of my tournaments,

03:32:24.880 --> 03:32:26.480
I think, so real.

03:32:26.480 --> 03:32:27.880
Yeah, man, you're an incredible person.

03:32:27.880 --> 03:32:29.280
I've been a fan for a long time.

03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:31.200
It's kind of funny that we connected

03:32:31.200 --> 03:32:33.400
and we got into chess to talk.

03:32:33.400 --> 03:32:36.640
Please, please keep creating, keep teaching people.

03:32:36.640 --> 03:32:38.280
For now, I'm not going anywhere.

03:32:39.280 --> 03:32:44.280
Well, it could end at any moment, as we talked about.

03:32:44.440 --> 03:32:46.840
So yeah, thank you so much for talking today, man.

03:32:46.840 --> 03:32:47.680
Thank you for everything you do.

03:32:47.680 --> 03:32:49.160
It was an honor.

03:32:49.160 --> 03:32:50.000
It was great.

03:32:50.000 --> 03:32:51.640
Thanks for having me on.

03:32:51.640 --> 03:32:53.200
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:32:53.200 --> 03:32:54.360

03:33:00.480 --> 03:33:02.040
from Irving Chernev.

03:33:02.960 --> 03:33:06.880
Every chess master was once a beginner.

03:33:06.880 --> 03:33:09.800
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
