00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
You could buy literally whatever else you wanted.

00:03.160 --> 00:04.800
You could host things, drugs.

00:04.800 --> 00:08.120
You could buy heroin right from Afghanistan, the good stuff.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.920
Hacking tools, you could hack for hire.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.480
You could buy murders for hire.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.200
The following is a conversation with Chris Tarbell,

00:16.200 --> 00:19.800
a former FBI special agent and cyber crime specialist

00:19.800 --> 00:23.240
who tracked down and arrested Russ Albrecht,

00:23.240 --> 00:27.240
the leader of Silk Road, the billion dollar drug marketplace.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.880
And he tracked down and arrested Hector Massaguer,

00:30.880 --> 00:34.560
AKA Sabu, of LulzSec and Anonymous,

00:34.560 --> 00:36.120
which are some of the most influential

00:36.120 --> 00:37.960
hacker groups in history.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.280
He is co-founder of Naxo,

00:40.280 --> 00:43.000
a complex cyber crime investigation firm,

00:43.000 --> 00:47.960
and is a co-host of a podcast called The Hacker and the Fed.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.200
This conversation gives the perspective

00:50.200 --> 00:52.880
of the FBI cyber crime investigator,

00:52.880 --> 00:55.800
both the technical and the human story.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.960
I would also like to interview people on the other side,

00:58.960 --> 01:01.240
the cyber criminals who have been caught,

01:01.240 --> 01:04.800
and perhaps the cyber criminals who have not been caught

01:04.800 --> 01:06.400
and are still out there.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.200
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.200
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:11.200 --> 01:12.360
in the description.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.720
And now, dear friends, here's Chris Tarbell.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
You are one of the most successful

01:18.600 --> 01:21.720
cybersecurity law enforcement agents of all time.

01:21.720 --> 01:25.040
You tracked and brought down Russ Albrecht,

01:25.040 --> 01:27.600
AKA Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran Silk Road,

01:27.600 --> 01:32.440
and Sabu of LulzSec and Anonymous,

01:32.440 --> 01:35.720
who was one of the most influential hackers in the world.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.360
So first, can you tell me the story

01:38.360 --> 01:41.200
of tracking down Russ Albrecht and Silk Road?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.640
Let's start from the very beginning.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.920
And maybe let's start by explaining

01:43.920 --> 01:45.280
what is the Silk Road.

01:45.280 --> 01:49.520
It was really the first dark market website.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.520
You literally could buy anything there.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.200
Well, I'll take that back.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.200
There's two things you couldn't buy there.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.760
You couldn't buy guns, because that was a different website,

01:58.760 --> 02:00.360
and you couldn't buy fake degrees.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.960
So no one could become a doctor,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.280
but you could buy literally whatever else you wanted.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.920
You could throw things, drugs.

02:07.920 --> 02:11.280
You could buy heroin right from Afghanistan, the good stuff.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.080
Hacking tools, you could hack for hire.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.800
You could buy murders for hire

02:14.800 --> 02:16.120
if you wanted someone killed.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.760
Now, so when I was an FBI agent,

02:18.760 --> 02:20.440
I had to kind of sell some of these cases,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.400
and this was a big drug case.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.920
That's the way people saw Silk Road.

02:23.920 --> 02:26.920
So internally to the FBI, how I had to sell it,

02:26.920 --> 02:28.800
I had to find the worst thing on there

02:28.800 --> 02:30.640
that I could possibly find.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.400
And I think one time I saw a posting for baby parts.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.840
So let's say that you had a young child

02:36.840 --> 02:38.280
and that needed a liver.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.000
You could literally go on there and ask

02:40.000 --> 02:43.040
for a six-month-old liver if you wanted to.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.440
For like surgical operations versus something darker.

02:46.440 --> 02:48.200
Yeah, I never saw anything that dark

02:48.200 --> 02:51.000
as far as people wanted to eat body parts.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.520
I did interview a cannibal once when I was in the FBI.

02:53.520 --> 02:54.840
That's another crazy story,

02:54.840 --> 02:57.280
but that one actually weirded me out.

02:57.280 --> 03:00.960
So I just watched Jeffrey Dahmer, a documentary on Netflix,

03:00.960 --> 03:04.080
and it just changed the way I see human beings

03:04.080 --> 03:08.320
because it's a portrayal of a normal-looking person

03:08.320 --> 03:12.080
doing really dark things and doing,

03:12.080 --> 03:15.280
so not out of a place of insanity seemingly,

03:15.280 --> 03:18.160
but just because he has almost like a fetish

03:18.160 --> 03:19.440
for that kind of thing.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.120
It's disturbing that people like that are out there.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.920
So people like that would then be using Silk Road,

03:26.920 --> 03:28.080
not like that necessarily,

03:28.080 --> 03:30.120
but people of different walks of life

03:30.120 --> 03:32.000
would be using Silk Road to primarily,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.280
what was the primary thing, drugs?

03:34.280 --> 03:36.000
It was primarily drugs, and that's where it started.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.520
It started off with Ross Albrecht growing mushrooms

03:38.520 --> 03:41.320
out in the wilderness of California and selling them.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.800
But really his was more of a libertarian viewpoint.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.640
I mean, it was like you choose

03:45.640 --> 03:48.040
what you wanna do for yourself and do it.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.800
And the way Silk Road kind of had the anonymity

03:50.800 --> 03:54.120
is it used what's called Tor, the onion router,

03:54.120 --> 03:59.120
which is an anonymizing function on the deep web.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.440
It was actually invented by the US Navy

04:01.440 --> 04:05.320
back in the mid-90s or so, but it also used cryptocurrency.

04:05.320 --> 04:07.560
So it was the first time that we saw this birth

04:07.560 --> 04:10.600
on the internet of mixing cryptocurrency

04:10.600 --> 04:13.320
and an IP blocking software.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.720
So in cyber crime, you go after one the IP address

04:16.880 --> 04:18.240
and trace it through the network,

04:18.240 --> 04:19.760
or two, you go after the cash.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.600
And this one kind of blocked both.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.480
Cash meaning the flow of money, physical or digital.

04:25.480 --> 04:30.200
And then IP is some kind of identifying thing

04:30.200 --> 04:31.080
of the computer.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.040
It's your telephone number on your computer.

04:33.040 --> 04:38.040
So yeah, all computers have a unique four octet numbers.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.760
So 123.123.123.123.

04:43.760 --> 04:48.120
And the computer uses DNS or domain name services

04:48.120 --> 04:49.440
to render that name.

04:49.440 --> 04:52.040
So if you were looking for cnn.com,

04:52.040 --> 04:54.400
your computer then translates that to that IP address

04:54.400 --> 04:56.840
or that telephone number where it can find that information.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.680
Didn't Silk Road used to have guns in the beginning?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.720
Or was that considered to have guns?

05:01.720 --> 05:05.880
Or did it naturally emerge and then Ross realized

05:05.880 --> 05:07.400
like this is not good?

05:07.400 --> 05:08.960
It went back and forth.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.360
I think there were guns on there and he tried to police it.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
He told himself that they're the captain of the boat,

05:15.000 --> 05:16.280
so he had to follow his rules.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.160
So I think he took off those posts eventually

05:19.160 --> 05:21.080
and moved guns elsewhere.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.760
What was the system of censorship that he used

05:24.760 --> 05:27.560
of selecting what is okay and not okay?

05:27.560 --> 05:28.380
I mean-

05:28.380 --> 05:30.000
Him alone, he's the captain of the boat.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.880
Do you know by chance if there was a lot of debates

05:33.880 --> 05:37.080
and criticisms internally amongst the criminals

05:37.080 --> 05:38.480
of what is and isn't allowed?

05:38.480 --> 05:40.400
I mean, it's interesting to see

05:40.480 --> 05:42.800
a totally different moral code emerge

05:42.800 --> 05:46.560
that's outside the legal code of society.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.680
We did get the server and was able to read

05:48.680 --> 05:50.920
all of the chat logs that happened.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.920
I mean, all the records were there.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.240
I don't remember big debates.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.840
I mean, there was a clear leadership

05:56.840 --> 05:58.120
and that was the final decision.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.400
That was the CEO of Silk Road.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.160
And so primarily it was drugs

06:02.160 --> 06:06.800
and primarily out of an ideology of freedom,

06:06.800 --> 06:10.760
which is if you want to use drugs,

06:10.760 --> 06:12.520
you should be able to use drugs.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.600
You should put in your body

06:13.600 --> 06:15.160
what you want to put in your body.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.920
And when you were presenting a case

06:16.920 --> 06:19.160
of why this should be investigated,

06:19.160 --> 06:21.400
you were trying to find, as you mentioned,

06:21.400 --> 06:23.600
the worst possible things on there?

06:23.600 --> 06:24.680
Is that what you were saying?

06:24.680 --> 06:26.720
So we had arrested a guy named Jeremy Hammond

06:26.720 --> 06:27.800
and he hit himself.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.960
He was a hacker and we arrested him.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.000
It was the second time he had been arrested for hacking.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.240
He used Tor.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.240
And so that kind of brought us to a point.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.960
The FBI has a computer system where you look up things,

06:41.960 --> 06:42.840
you look up anything.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.520
I could look up your name or whatever

06:44.520 --> 06:46.520
if you're associated with my case.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.840
And we were finding at the time a lot of things

06:48.840 --> 06:51.520
in you need to look it up, a case would end,

06:51.520 --> 06:54.320
be like, oh, this is Tor and just stopped.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.760
Like we couldn't get any further.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.040
So we had just had this bigger rest of Sabu

07:00.040 --> 07:01.200
and took down Anonymous.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.160
And sometimes in the FBI,

07:04.240 --> 07:06.360
the way it used to the old school FBI,

07:06.360 --> 07:09.040
when you had a big case and you're working seven days a week

07:09.040 --> 07:13.040
and 14 hours, 15 hours a day, you sort of take a break.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.800
The boss kind of said, yeah, I'll see you in a few months.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.480
Go get to know your family a little bit and come back.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.520
But the group of guys I was with was like,

07:20.520 --> 07:22.000
let's find the next big challenge.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.800
And that's when we were finding case closed, it was Tor.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
Case closed, it was Tor.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.440
So I said, let's take a look at Tor

07:27.440 --> 07:28.280
and let's see what we can do.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.520
Maybe we'll take a different approach.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.040
Silk Road was being looked at by other law enforcement,

07:33.040 --> 07:34.480
but it was taking like a drug approach

07:34.480 --> 07:37.440
where I'm going to find a drug buyer

07:37.440 --> 07:39.800
who got the drug sent to them in the mail

07:39.800 --> 07:42.120
and let's arrest up, let's go up the chain.

07:42.120 --> 07:43.800
But the buyers didn't know their dealers,

07:43.800 --> 07:45.720
they never met them.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.200
And so you were taking a cyber security approach.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.960
Yeah, we said, let's try to look at this

07:49.960 --> 07:52.520
from a cyber approach and see if we can

07:52.520 --> 07:54.360
gleam anything out of it.

07:54.360 --> 07:59.360
So I'm actually indirectly connected to

07:59.560 --> 08:01.560
I'm sure I'm not admitting anything

08:01.560 --> 08:03.440
that's not already on my FBI file.

08:03.440 --> 08:05.520
Oh, I can already tell you what you're gonna tell me though.

08:05.520 --> 08:06.360
What's that?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.400
That when you were at college, you wrote a paper

08:08.400 --> 08:10.760
and you're connected to the person that started.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.200
You son of a bitch.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.400
You clever son of a bitch.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.800
I'm an FBI agent or a former FBI agent.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.440
How would I not have known that?

08:17.440 --> 08:18.720
I could have told you other stuff.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.760
No, that's exactly what you were about to tell me.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.320
I was looking up his name because I forgot it.

08:22.320 --> 08:26.040
So one of my advisors for my PhD was Rachel Greenstatt

08:26.040 --> 08:29.760
and she is married to Roger Dingledine,

08:29.760 --> 08:32.160
which is the co-founder of The Tor Project

08:32.160 --> 08:33.920
and actually reached out to him last night

08:33.920 --> 08:35.520
to do a podcast together.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.360
I don't know.

08:36.360 --> 08:41.360
It was a good party trick.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.880
I mean, it's cool that you know this

08:46.880 --> 08:50.440
and the timing of it, it was just like beautiful.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.520
But just to link around on The Tor Project.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.320
So we understand.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.320
So Tor is this black box that people disappear in

09:02.800 --> 09:06.000
in terms of like the when you were tracking people.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.920
Can you paint a picture of what Tor is used in general?

09:10.360 --> 09:12.560
It's like when you talk about Bitcoin, for example,

09:12.560 --> 09:15.480
cryptocurrency, especially today,

09:15.480 --> 09:18.120
much more people use it for legal activity

09:18.120 --> 09:19.600
versus illegal activity.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.960
What about Tor?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.560
Tor was originally invented by the US Navy

09:23.560 --> 09:26.240
so that like spies inside countries could talk to spies

09:26.240 --> 09:28.200
and no one could find them.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.720
There was no way of tracing them.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.680
And then they released that information free to the world.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.760
So Tor has two different versions of versions,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.240
two different ways it can be utilized.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.480
There's .onionsites, which is like a normal website, a .com,

09:41.480 --> 09:43.200
but it's only found within the Tor browser.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.040
You can only get there

09:44.040 --> 09:46.320
if you know the whole address and get there.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.720
The other way Tor is used is to go through the internet

09:49.720 --> 09:51.200
and then come out the other side

09:51.200 --> 09:53.040
if you want a different IP address.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.760
If you're trying to hide your identity.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.720
So if you were doing like, say, cybercrime,

09:57.720 --> 09:59.200
I would have the victim computer

09:59.200 --> 10:01.720
and I would trace it back out to a Tor relay.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.760
And then because you don't have an active connection

10:04.760 --> 10:06.280
or what's called a circuit at the time,

10:06.280 --> 10:07.680
I wouldn't be able to trace it back.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.400
But even if you had an active circuit,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.960
I would have to go to each machine physically live

10:11.960 --> 10:15.560
and try to rebuild that, which is literally impossible.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.600
So what do you feel about Tor ethically, philosophically,

10:19.640 --> 10:21.920
as a human being on this world

10:21.920 --> 10:25.120
that spent quite a few years of your life

10:25.120 --> 10:27.720
and still trying to protect people?

10:27.720 --> 10:29.480
So part of my time in the FBI

10:29.480 --> 10:31.680
was working on child exploitation,

10:31.680 --> 10:33.600
kiddie porn, as they call it.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.240
That really changed my life in a way.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.680
And so anything that helps facilitate

10:37.680 --> 10:41.160
the exploitation of children fucking pisses me off.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.160
And that sort of jaded my opinion towards Tor,

10:46.520 --> 10:49.680
because that, because it helps facilitate those sites.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.160
So this ideal of freedom that Russell Albrecht,

10:53.160 --> 10:57.360
for example, tried to embody is something

10:57.360 --> 11:00.920
that you don't connect with anymore

11:00.920 --> 11:05.920
because of what you've seen that ideal being used for.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.240
I mean, the child exploitation

11:08.240 --> 11:09.960
is the specific example for it.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.800
And it's easy for me to sit here

11:11.800 --> 11:13.520
and say child exploitation, child porn,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.600
because no one listening to this is ever gonna say

11:15.600 --> 11:19.240
that I'm wrong and that we should allow child porn.

11:19.240 --> 11:22.480
Should, because some people utilize it in a bad way,

11:22.480 --> 11:23.600
should it go away?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.680
No, I mean, I'm a technologist.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.560
I want technology to move forward.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.080
People are gonna do bad things

11:32.080 --> 11:33.600
and they're going to use technology

11:33.600 --> 11:35.720
to help them do bad things.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.600
Well, let me ask you then,

11:37.600 --> 11:38.840
we'll jump around a little bit,

11:38.840 --> 11:41.560
but the things you were able to do

11:41.560 --> 11:44.800
in tracking down information, and we'll get to it,

11:44.840 --> 11:49.760
there is some suspicion that this was only possible

11:49.760 --> 11:54.760
with mass surveillance, like with NSA, for example.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.680
First of all, is there any truth to that?

11:56.680 --> 11:59.000
And second of all, what do you feel

11:59.000 --> 12:01.480
are the pros and cons of mass surveillance?

12:02.760 --> 12:04.760
There is no truth to that.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.120
And then my feelings on mass surveillance.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.520
If there was, would you tell me?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.600
Probably not, but.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.760
I love this conversation so much.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.520
But what do you feel about the,

12:16.520 --> 12:18.480
given that you said child porn,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.600
what are the pros and cons of surveillance

12:21.600 --> 12:22.880
at a society level?

12:24.040 --> 12:26.280
I mean, nobody wants to give up their privacy.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.720
I say that, I say no one wants to give up their privacy,

12:28.720 --> 12:30.400
but I mean, I used to have to get a search warrant

12:30.400 --> 12:31.800
to look inside your house,

12:31.800 --> 12:33.320
or I can just log on to your Facebook

12:33.320 --> 12:35.160
and you've got pictures of all inside your house

12:35.160 --> 12:36.280
and what's going on.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.320
I mean, it's not, so people like the idea

12:39.320 --> 12:41.720
of not giving up their privacy,

12:41.720 --> 12:43.560
but they do it anyways.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.200
They're giving away their freedoms all the time.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.920
They're carrying watches that gives out their heartbeat

12:47.920 --> 12:49.680
to a weight of companies that are storing that.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.480
I mean, what's more personal than your heartbeat?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.680
So I think people on mass

12:55.680 --> 12:57.480
really want to protect their privacy.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.280
And I would say most people don't really need

13:00.280 --> 13:01.640
to protect their privacy.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.720
But the case against mass surveillance

13:03.720 --> 13:08.080
is that if you want to criticize the government

13:08.080 --> 13:10.200
in a very difficult time,

13:10.200 --> 13:12.360
you should be able to do it.

13:12.360 --> 13:15.880
So when you need the freedom, you should have it.

13:15.880 --> 13:17.960
So when you wake up one day and realize

13:17.960 --> 13:21.280
there's something going wrong with the country I love,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.760
I want to be able to help.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.360
And that one of the great things

13:25.360 --> 13:28.120
about the United States of America

13:28.120 --> 13:31.480
is there's that individual revolutionary spirit,

13:31.480 --> 13:35.440
like so that the government doesn't become too powerful.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.200
You can always protest.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.760
There's always the best of the ideal of freedom of speech.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.200
You can always say, fuck you to the man.

13:43.200 --> 13:46.760
And I think there's a concern of direct

13:46.760 --> 13:49.920
or indirect suppression of that through mass surveillance.

13:49.920 --> 13:54.200
You might not, is that that little subtle fear

13:54.200 --> 13:56.000
that grows with time,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.560
that why bother criticizing the government?

13:59.560 --> 14:01.880
It's gonna be a headache, I'm gonna get a ticket

14:01.880 --> 14:04.280
every time I say something bad, that kind of thing.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.840
So it can get out of hand.

14:05.840 --> 14:09.720
The bureaucracy grows and the freedoms slip away.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.680
That's the criticism, right?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.040
I completely see your point and I agree with it.

14:15.040 --> 14:16.600
But on the other side,

14:16.600 --> 14:19.040
people criticize the government of these freedoms,

14:19.040 --> 14:21.600
but tech companies talk about destroying your privacy

14:21.600 --> 14:23.480
and controlling what you can say.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.160
I realize they're private platforms

14:25.160 --> 14:28.520
and they can decide what's on their platform,

14:28.520 --> 14:30.800
but they're taking away your freedoms of what you can say.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.600
And we've heard some things

14:32.600 --> 14:35.360
where maybe government officials were in line

14:35.360 --> 14:38.480
with tech companies to take away some of that freedom.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.560
I agree with you, that gets scary.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.480
Yeah, there's something about government that feels

14:44.600 --> 14:47.240
maybe because of the history of human civilization,

14:47.240 --> 14:50.040
maybe because tech companies are a new thing,

14:50.040 --> 14:53.400
but just knowing the history of abuses of government.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.200
There's something about government

14:57.200 --> 14:59.920
that enables the corrupting nature of power

14:59.920 --> 15:02.600
to take hold at scale more than tech companies,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.240
at least what we've seen so far.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.720
I agree, I agree.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.560
We haven't had a voice like we've had until recently.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.480
Anyone that has a Twitter account now can speak

15:13.480 --> 15:15.200
and become a news article.

15:16.680 --> 15:18.720
My parents didn't have that voice.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.360
If they wanted to speak out against the government

15:21.360 --> 15:22.880
or do something, they had to go to a protest

15:22.880 --> 15:26.200
or organize a protest or do something along those lines.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.240
So we have more of a place to put our voice out now.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.600
Yeah, it's incredible, but that's why it hurts

15:32.600 --> 15:34.120
and that's why you notice it

15:34.120 --> 15:36.240
when certain voices get removed.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.880
The president of the United States of America

15:39.880 --> 15:43.240
was removed from one such or all such platforms

15:44.200 --> 15:45.440
and that hurts.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.760
Yeah, that's crazy to me, that's insane.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.120
That's insane that we took that away, but.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.880
Let's return to Silk Grove and Rosalbrink.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.720
So how did your path with this very difficult,

15:58.720 --> 16:02.720
very fascinating case cross?

16:02.720 --> 16:05.600
We were looking to open a case against Tor

16:05.600 --> 16:06.480
because it was a problem.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.520
All the cases were closing because Tor.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.520
So we went on Tor and we came up with 26 different onion,

16:13.800 --> 16:16.800
dot onions that we targeted.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.640
We were looking for nexuses to hacking

16:19.640 --> 16:21.640
because I was on a squad called CY2

16:21.640 --> 16:25.440
and we were like the premier squad in New York

16:25.440 --> 16:29.360
that was working criminal cyber intrusions.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.440
And so any website that was offering hackers for hire

16:33.440 --> 16:38.440
or hacking tools for free or paid services.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.800
Now we're seeing ransomware as a paid service

16:42.800 --> 16:44.880
and phishing as a paid service.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.840
Anything that offered that.

16:45.840 --> 16:49.200
So we opened this case on, I think we called it,

16:49.200 --> 16:50.160
so you have to name cases.

16:50.160 --> 16:51.240
One of the fun thing in the FBI

16:51.240 --> 16:53.800
is when you start a case, you get to name it.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.880
You would not believe how much time is spent

16:55.880 --> 16:57.200
in coming up with the name.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.560
Casey goes by, I think we called this onion peeler

17:00.560 --> 17:02.240
because of the, yeah.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.440
So a little bit of humor, a little bit of wit

17:05.440 --> 17:07.560
and some profundity to the language.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.400
Yeah, yeah.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.560
Because you're gonna have to work with this one

17:09.560 --> 17:11.040
for quite a lot, so.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.520
Yeah, this one had the potential of being a big one

17:13.520 --> 17:17.280
because I think Silk Road was like the sixth on the list

17:17.280 --> 17:18.680
for that case, but we all knew

17:18.680 --> 17:20.080
that was sort of the golden ring.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.960
If you could make the splash

17:21.960 --> 17:24.200
that that onion site was going down,

17:24.200 --> 17:25.880
then it would probably get some publicity.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.760
And that's part of law enforcement

17:27.760 --> 17:29.760
is getting some publicity out of it

17:29.760 --> 17:33.720
that makes others think not to do it.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.960
I wish to say that Tor is the name of the project,

17:36.960 --> 17:38.280
the browser.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.600
What is the onion technology behind Tor?

17:40.600 --> 17:42.960
Let's say you wanna go to a .onion site.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.400
You'll put in the .onion you wanna go to

17:45.400 --> 17:47.800
and your computer will build communications

17:47.800 --> 17:49.120
with a Tor relay,

17:49.120 --> 17:51.920
which are all publicly available out there,

17:51.920 --> 17:53.320
but you'll encrypt it.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.040
You'll put a package around your data

17:56.040 --> 17:59.120
and so it's encrypted and so can't read it.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.520
It goes to that first relay.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.880
That first relay knows about you

18:03.880 --> 18:06.400
and then knows about the next relay down the chain.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.880
And so it takes your data

18:07.880 --> 18:09.400
and then encrypts that on the outside

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
and sends it to relay number two.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.240
Now, relay number two only knows about relay number one.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.320
It doesn't know who you are asking for this

18:16.320 --> 18:18.960
and it goes through there, adding those layers on top,

18:18.960 --> 18:21.440
layers of encryption till it gets to where it is.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.640
And then even the onion service doesn't know

18:23.640 --> 18:27.320
except for the relay it came from, who it's talking to.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.760
And so it peels back that, gives the information,

18:29.760 --> 18:31.280
puts another layer back on.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.760
And so it's layers like you're peeling an onion back

18:34.760 --> 18:36.560
of the different relays

18:36.560 --> 18:40.200
and that encryption protects who the sender is

18:40.200 --> 18:41.400
and what information they're sending.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.400
The more layers there are,

18:42.400 --> 18:47.040
the more exponentially difficult it is to decrypt it.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.320
I mean, you get to a place

18:48.320 --> 18:50.240
where you don't have to have so many layers

18:50.240 --> 18:52.120
because it doesn't matter anymore.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.360
It's mathematically impossible to decrypt it.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.280
But the more relays you have, the slower it is.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.800
I mean, that's one of the big drawbacks on TOR

19:00.800 --> 19:03.240
is how slow it operates.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.000
So how do you peel the onion?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.800
So what are the different methodologies

19:07.800 --> 19:10.920
for trying to get some information

19:10.920 --> 19:12.880
from a cybersecurity perspective

19:12.880 --> 19:15.400
on these operations like the Silk Road?

19:15.400 --> 19:17.160
It's very difficult.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.800
People have come up with different techniques.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.760
There's been techniques to put out in the news media

19:22.760 --> 19:24.320
about how they do it.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.280
I mean, you're running massive amounts of relays

19:28.280 --> 19:30.120
and you're controlling those relays, I think.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.720
I think somebody tried that once.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.240
So there's a technical solution

19:33.240 --> 19:35.960
and what about social engineering?

19:35.960 --> 19:40.960
What about trying to infiltrate the actual humans

19:41.160 --> 19:45.680
that are using the Silk Road and trying to get in that way?

19:46.640 --> 19:49.120
Yeah, I mean, I definitely could see the way of doing that.

19:49.120 --> 19:53.280
And in this case, in our take down, we used that.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.120
Jared Dayrigan, he was an HSI investigator

19:56.120 --> 19:58.720
and he had worked his way up to be a system admin

19:58.720 --> 20:00.280
on the site.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.640
So that did glean quite a bit of information

20:02.640 --> 20:07.120
because he was inside and talking to, at that time,

20:07.120 --> 20:09.840
we only know it as DPR or Dread Pirate Roberts.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.560
We didn't know who that was yet,

20:11.560 --> 20:13.640
but we had that open communication.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.160
And one of the things, the technical aspects on that

20:18.160 --> 20:20.600
is there was a Jabber server.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.840
There was, that's a communication,

20:22.840 --> 20:26.000
type of communication server that was being used.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
And we knew that Ross had his Jabber set to Pacific time.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.480
So we had a pretty good idea

20:33.480 --> 20:37.480
what part of the country he was in.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.160
I mean, isn't that, from DPR's perspective,

20:42.160 --> 20:45.280
from Ross's perspective, isn't that clumsy?

20:45.280 --> 20:47.680
He wasn't a big computer guy.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.200
Do you notice that aspect of the technical savvy

20:50.200 --> 20:52.920
of some of these guys doesn't seem to be quite,

20:52.920 --> 20:55.080
why weren't they good at this?

20:55.080 --> 20:57.760
Well, the real techie savvy ones, we don't arrest.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.960
We don't get to them, we don't find them.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.800
You don't get to them.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.920
Shout out to the techie criminals.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.880
They're probably watching this.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.880
I mean, yeah, I mean, we're getting the low-hanging fruit.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.680
I mean, we're getting the ones that can be caught.

21:10.680 --> 21:13.120
I mean, they, you know, I'm sure we'll talk about it,

21:13.120 --> 21:15.200
but the anonymous case, there was a guy named AV Unit.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.920
He's still, I lose sleep over him

21:16.920 --> 21:18.080
because we didn't catch him.

21:18.120 --> 21:21.000
We caught everybody else, we didn't catch him.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.720
He's good though.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.560
He pops up too once in a while on the internet

21:24.560 --> 21:25.520
and it pisses me off.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.760
Yeah, what's his name again?

21:26.760 --> 21:29.800
AV Unit, that's all I know is his AV Unit.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.640
AV Unit.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.320
Yeah, I got a funny story about him

21:32.320 --> 21:34.320
and who people think he is.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.520
Can I actually, can we go on that brief tangent?

21:36.520 --> 21:37.840
Sure, I love tangents.

21:39.560 --> 21:43.680
Well, let me ask you, since he's probably he or she,

21:43.680 --> 21:44.920
do we know it's a he?

21:44.920 --> 21:46.040
We have no idea.

21:46.040 --> 21:46.880
Okay.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.000
Another funny story about hackers, the he, she issue.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.160
What's the funny story there?

21:51.160 --> 21:53.760
Well, one of the guys in LulzSec was a she.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.960
He was a 17 year old girl.

21:55.960 --> 22:00.400
And my source in the case, the guy Sabu that I arrested

22:00.400 --> 22:02.960
and part of it, you know, we sat side by side

22:02.960 --> 22:05.800
for nine months and then took down, you know,

22:05.800 --> 22:06.840
the case and all that.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.200
He was convinced she was a girl and it was said, you know,

22:10.200 --> 22:12.800
and he was in love with her almost at one point.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.160
It turns out to be a 35 year old guy living in England.

22:16.160 --> 22:19.000
Oh, so he was convinced as a...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.400
Yes, he was absolutely convinced.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.640
Based on what exactly?

22:21.640 --> 22:25.600
By linguistic, like human-based linguistic analysis or what?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.920
She, she, he, whatever, you know, Kayla,

22:28.920 --> 22:31.520
is the way it ended up being like a modification

22:31.520 --> 22:34.800
of his sister's name, the real guy's sister's name,

22:34.800 --> 22:37.680
was so good at building the backstory.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.320
All these guys, and it's funny,

22:39.320 --> 22:40.720
like these guys are part of a hacking crew.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.560
They social engineer the shit out of each other.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.080
Just to build if one of them ever gets caught,

22:47.000 --> 22:48.200
they'll convince the everybody else that, you know,

22:48.200 --> 22:51.560
they're a Brazilian, you know, ISP owner

22:51.560 --> 22:52.400
or something like that.

22:52.400 --> 22:53.760
And that's how I'm so powerful.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.560
Well, yeah, that social engineering aspect

22:55.560 --> 22:58.120
is part of living a life of cyber crime

22:58.120 --> 23:00.720
or cybersecurity and the offensive or defensive.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.360
So AV unit, can I ask you also

23:03.360 --> 23:05.680
just the attention of a tangent first?

23:05.680 --> 23:06.960
That's my favorite tangent.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.800
Okay.

23:09.400 --> 23:14.400
Is it possible for me to have a podcast conversation

23:14.600 --> 23:16.880
with somebody who hasn't been caught yet

23:18.360 --> 23:20.240
and because they have the conversation,

23:20.240 --> 23:22.240
they still won't be caught?

23:22.240 --> 23:24.400
And is that a good idea?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.360
Meaning, is there a safe way for a criminal

23:26.360 --> 23:28.000
to talk to me at a podcast?

23:29.480 --> 23:31.440
I would think so.

23:31.440 --> 23:33.640
I would think that someone could,

23:33.640 --> 23:36.440
I mean, someone who has been living a double life

23:36.440 --> 23:39.560
for long enough where you think they're not a criminal.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.800
No, no, no, they would have to admit

23:42.840 --> 23:45.120
that they would say I am AV unit.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.240
Oh, you would wanna have a conversation with AV unit.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.080
Yes.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.480
I'm just speaking from an FBI perspective,

23:52.480 --> 23:53.880
technically speaking,

23:53.880 --> 23:57.360
because let me explain my motivation.

23:57.360 --> 24:02.360
I think I would like to be able to talk

24:02.520 --> 24:05.000
to people from all walks of life

24:05.000 --> 24:09.160
and understanding criminals, understanding their mind,

24:09.160 --> 24:11.080
I think is very important.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.480
And I think there's fundamentally something different

24:14.480 --> 24:16.600
between a criminal who's still active

24:16.600 --> 24:18.280
versus one that's been caught.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.560
The mind, just from observing it,

24:20.560 --> 24:23.840
changes completely once you're caught.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.280
You have a big shift in your understanding of the world.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.880
I mean, I do have a question about the ethics

24:30.880 --> 24:32.200
of having such conversations,

24:32.200 --> 24:36.320
but first, technically, is it possible?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.320
If I was technically advising you,

24:39.760 --> 24:42.080
I would say, first off, don't advertise it.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.040
The fewer people that you're gonna tell

24:44.040 --> 24:46.840
that you're having this conversation with, the better.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.000
And yeah, you could, are you doing it in person?

24:50.000 --> 24:50.840
Are you doing it in-

24:50.840 --> 24:52.120
In person would be amazing, yeah,

24:52.120 --> 24:54.000
but their face would not be shown.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.440
Face would not be shown, yeah.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.800
I mean, you couldn't publish a show for a while.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.200
They'd have to put a lot of trust in you

24:59.200 --> 25:03.400
that you're gonna have to alter those tapes.

25:04.400 --> 25:07.200
I say tapes, because it's old school, the opt-on.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.040
It's a tape.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.960
Exactly, I'm sure a lot of people just said that,

25:09.960 --> 25:11.840
like, oh shit, this old guy just sent tape.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.600
I heard VHS was in the 1800s, I think.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.640
But yeah, yeah, you could do it.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.120
They'd have to have complete faith and trust in you

25:21.120 --> 25:24.600
that you destroy the originals after you've altered it.

25:24.600 --> 25:25.960
What about if they don't have faith?

25:25.960 --> 25:29.000
Is there a way for them to attain security?

25:29.920 --> 25:34.120
So, like, for me to go through some kind of process

25:34.120 --> 25:36.120
where I meet them somewhere where-

25:36.120 --> 25:37.080
I mean, you're not gonna do it

25:37.080 --> 25:38.440
without a bag over your head.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.360
I don't know if that's the life you wanna live.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.360
I'm fine with a bag over my head.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.920
That's gonna get taken out of context.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.600
But I just, I think it's a worthy effort.

25:47.600 --> 25:50.480
It's worthy to go through the hardship of that

25:50.480 --> 25:52.440
to understand the mind of somebody.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.880
I think fundamentally, conversations are a different thing

25:56.880 --> 25:58.880
than the operation of law enforcement.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.200
Understanding the mind of a criminal,

26:00.200 --> 26:01.720
I think, is really important.

26:01.720 --> 26:03.200
I don't know if you're gonna have

26:03.200 --> 26:05.560
the honest conversation that you're looking for.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.360
I mean, it may sound honest, but it may not be the truth.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.320
I found most times when I was talking to criminals,

26:10.320 --> 26:12.760
it's lies mixed with half-truths.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.480
And you kinda, if they're good,

26:15.480 --> 26:18.120
they can keep that story going for long enough.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.160
If they're not, you kind of see the relief in them

26:21.160 --> 26:24.160
when you finally break that wall down.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.760
That's the job of an interviewer.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.640
If the interviewer is good, then perhaps not directly,

26:30.680 --> 26:35.680
but through the gaps seeps out the truth of the human being.

26:36.040 --> 26:37.520
So not necessarily the details

26:37.520 --> 26:39.840
of how they do the operations and so on,

26:39.840 --> 26:41.360
but just who they are as a human being,

26:41.360 --> 26:44.280
what their motivations are, what their ethics are,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.480
how they see the world, what is good, what is evil.

26:46.480 --> 26:48.000
Do they see themselves as good?

26:48.000 --> 26:50.400
What do they see their motivation as?

26:50.400 --> 26:51.960
Do they have resentment?

26:51.960 --> 26:54.240
What do they think about love for the people

26:54.240 --> 26:55.960
within their small community?

26:55.960 --> 26:57.760
Do they have resentment for the government

26:57.760 --> 27:00.200
or for other nations or for other people?

27:00.200 --> 27:02.200
Do they have childhood issues that led

27:02.200 --> 27:05.840
to a different view of the world than others perhaps have?

27:05.840 --> 27:09.120
Do they have certain fetishes like sexual and otherwise

27:09.120 --> 27:12.160
that led to the construction of the world?

27:12.160 --> 27:16.000
They might be able to reveal some deep flaws

27:16.000 --> 27:20.160
to the cybersecurity infrastructure of our world.

27:20.160 --> 27:24.280
Not in detail, but like philosophically speaking,

27:24.280 --> 27:29.280
they might have, I know you might say it's just a narrative,

27:29.560 --> 27:33.480
but they might have a kind of ethical concern

27:33.480 --> 27:35.160
for the wellbeing of the world

27:36.120 --> 27:38.800
that they're essentially attacking the weakness

27:38.800 --> 27:40.440
of the cybersecurity infrastructure

27:40.440 --> 27:42.400
because they believe ultimately

27:42.400 --> 27:44.880
that would lead to a safer world.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.960
So the attacks will reveal the weaknesses.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.360
And if they're stealing a bunch of money,

27:50.360 --> 27:52.520
that's okay because that's gonna enforce you

27:52.520 --> 27:54.640
to invest a lot more money in defending,

27:55.920 --> 27:58.360
yeah, defending things that actually matter.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.360
Nuclear warheads and all those kinds of things.

28:01.360 --> 28:06.120
I mean, I could see, it's fascinating to explore the mind

28:06.120 --> 28:07.240
of a human being like that

28:07.240 --> 28:11.760
because I think it will help people understand.

28:11.760 --> 28:16.760
Now, of course, it's still a person

28:17.280 --> 28:19.640
that's creating a lot of suffering in the world,

28:19.640 --> 28:20.840
which is a problem.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.880
So do you think ethically it's a good thing to do?

28:23.880 --> 28:28.040
I don't, I mean, I feel like I have a fairly high

28:28.040 --> 28:30.880
ethical bar that I have to put myself on

28:30.880 --> 28:32.520
and I don't think I have a problem with it.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.360
I would love to listen to it.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.240
Okay, great.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.320
I mean, not that I'm your ethical coacher here.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.920
Yeah, well, that's interesting.

28:39.920 --> 28:44.440
I mean, so, cause I thought you would have become jaded

28:44.440 --> 28:49.440
and exhausted by the criminal mind.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.120
It's funny, you know, I'm, you know,

28:54.120 --> 28:55.480
fast forward in our story.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.800
I'm very good friends with Hector Montserrat,

28:57.800 --> 29:02.000
the Sabu, the guy I arrested and he tells stories

29:02.000 --> 29:05.080
of what he did in his past and I'm like, oh, that Hector,

29:05.080 --> 29:08.840
you know, you know, but then I listened to your episode

29:08.840 --> 29:11.440
with Brett Johnson and I was like,

29:11.440 --> 29:14.880
ah, this guy stealing money from the US government

29:14.880 --> 29:17.240
and welfare fraud and all this sort of things,

29:17.240 --> 29:18.240
it just pissed me off.

29:19.240 --> 29:23.080
And I don't know why I have that differentiation

29:23.080 --> 29:24.080
in my head.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.920
I don't know why I think one's just,

29:26.920 --> 29:28.920
oh, Hector will be Hector and then this guy

29:28.920 --> 29:30.120
just pissed me off.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.920
Well, you didn't feel that way about Hector

29:31.920 --> 29:33.560
until you probably met him.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.360
Well, I didn't know Hector, I knew Sabu.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.960
So I hunted down Sabu and I learned about Hector

29:39.960 --> 29:41.320
over those nine months.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.480
We'll talk about it.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.880
Let's finish with, let's return tangent

29:44.880 --> 29:46.000
to back to attention.

29:46.080 --> 29:50.080
Oh, run tangent up, who's AV unit?

29:50.080 --> 29:50.920
I don't know.

29:50.920 --> 29:51.760
That's interesting.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.800
So he's at the core of Anonymous.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.640
He's one of the critical people in Anonymous.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.000
What is known about him?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.920
There's what's known in public and what was known

29:59.920 --> 30:03.720
because I sat with Hector and he was sort of like

30:03.720 --> 30:05.960
the set things up guy.

30:05.960 --> 30:09.440
So if LulzSec had like their hackers,

30:09.440 --> 30:14.280
which was Sabu and Kayla and they had their media guy,

30:14.280 --> 30:17.360
this guy Topiary, he lived up in the Northern end

30:17.360 --> 30:20.160
of England and they had a few other guys,

30:20.160 --> 30:22.960
but AV unit was the guy that set up infrastructure.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.320
So if you need a VPN in Brazil or something like that

30:25.320 --> 30:29.640
to pop through, one of the first things Hector told me

30:29.640 --> 30:31.600
after we arrested him is that AV unit

30:31.600 --> 30:33.680
was a secret service agent.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.920
And I was like, oh shit.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.840
Just because he kind of lived that lifestyle.

30:38.840 --> 30:40.600
He'd be around for a bunch of days

30:40.600 --> 30:42.960
and then all of a sudden gone for three weeks.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.400
And I tried to get more out of Hector

30:45.400 --> 30:47.960
that early on in that relationship.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.800
I'm sure he was a little bit guarded.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.320
Maybe trying to social engineer me.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.600
Maybe he wanted that, oh shit,

30:53.600 --> 30:55.760
there's law enforcement involved in this.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.200
And not to say, I mean, I was in over my head

31:00.200 --> 31:02.920
with that case, just the amount of work that was going on.

31:02.920 --> 31:07.240
So to track them all down, plus the 350 hacks

31:07.240 --> 31:09.880
that came in about just military institutions,

31:10.400 --> 31:13.080
you know, it was swimming in the deep end.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.840
So it was just at the end of the case,

31:14.840 --> 31:17.480
I looked back and I was like, oh fuck, AV unit.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.200
I could've had them all.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.720
You know, maybe that's the perfectionist in me.

31:21.720 --> 31:25.040
Oh man, well, reach out somehow.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.200
I won't say how, right?

31:26.200 --> 31:27.120
We'll have to figure out.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.080
Would you have them on?

31:28.080 --> 31:29.440
Yeah. Oh my God.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.280
You just let me know.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.200
Just talk shit about you the whole time.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.120
That's perfect.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.720
He probably doesn't even care about me.

31:34.720 --> 31:38.120
Well, now he will because there's a certain pleasure

31:38.160 --> 31:41.320
of a guy who's extremely good at his job

31:41.320 --> 31:44.640
not catching another guy who's extremely good at his job.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.480
Obviously better.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.560
He got away.

31:46.560 --> 31:47.400
Better, there you go.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.240
He's still eating at you.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.560
I love it.

31:49.560 --> 31:50.400
He or she.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.760
If I can meet that guy one day, he or she,

31:52.760 --> 31:53.600
that'd be great.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.560
I mean, I have no power.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.200
So yes, Silk Road, can you speak to the scale of this thing?

31:59.200 --> 32:02.760
What, just for people who are not familiar,

32:02.760 --> 32:07.760
how big was it and any other interesting things

32:07.800 --> 32:11.040
to understand about its operation when it was active?

32:11.040 --> 32:14.800
So it was when we finally got looking through the books

32:14.800 --> 32:19.800
and the numbers came out as about $1.2 billion in sales.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.840
It's kind of hard with the fluctuation value of Bitcoin

32:22.840 --> 32:24.520
at the time to come up with a real number.

32:24.520 --> 32:27.440
So you kind of pick a daily average and go across.

32:27.440 --> 32:29.600
So most of the operation was done in Bitcoin.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.720
It was all done in Bitcoin.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.760
You couldn't, you had escrow accounts on,

32:33.760 --> 32:37.080
you came in and you put money in an escrow account

32:37.080 --> 32:40.920
and the transaction wasn't done until the client

32:40.920 --> 32:43.920
got the drugs or whatever they had bought.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.640
And then the drug dealers had sent it in.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.160
There was some talk at the time that the cartel

32:49.160 --> 32:51.040
was starting to sell on there.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.320
So that started getting a little hairy there at the end.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.000
What was your understanding of the relationship

32:55.000 --> 32:58.120
between organized crime like the cartels

32:58.120 --> 33:03.120
and this kind of more ad hoc new age market

33:05.440 --> 33:06.880
that is the Silk Road?

33:07.680 --> 33:08.520
I mean, it was all just chatter.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.000
It was just, you know, cause like I said,

33:10.000 --> 33:10.960
Jared was in the inside.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.600
So we saw some of it from the admin sides

33:13.600 --> 33:15.600
and Ross had a lot of private conversations

33:15.600 --> 33:18.280
with the different people that he had advised him,

33:19.280 --> 33:20.360
but no one knew each other.

33:20.360 --> 33:23.840
And I mean, the only thing that they knew

33:23.840 --> 33:27.960
with the admins had to send an ID to Ross,

33:27.960 --> 33:30.720
had to send a picture of their driver's license or passport,

33:30.720 --> 33:32.240
which I always found very strange

33:32.240 --> 33:36.440
because if you are an admin on a site that sells fake IDs,

33:36.440 --> 33:38.240
why would you send your real ID?

33:38.240 --> 33:40.080
And then why would the guy running the site

33:40.080 --> 33:45.080
who profits from selling fake IDs believe that it was?

33:45.280 --> 33:48.640
But fast forward, they were all real IDs.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.480
All the IDs that we found on Ross's computer

33:50.480 --> 33:52.640
as the admins were the real people's IDs.

33:52.640 --> 33:53.480
What do you make of that?

33:53.480 --> 33:55.240
Just other clumsiness?

33:55.240 --> 33:56.840
Yeah, low hanging fruit, I guess.

33:56.840 --> 33:57.760
I guess that's what it is.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.800
I mean, I would have bought, I mean,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.800
even Ross bought fake IDs off the site.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.840
He had federal agents knock on his door,

34:05.840 --> 34:08.160
you know, and then he got a little cocky about it.

34:08.160 --> 34:11.640
The landscape, the dynamics of trust is fascinating here.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.800
So you trust certain ideas are,

34:13.800 --> 34:15.800
like who do you trust in that kind of market?

34:15.800 --> 34:19.240
What was your understanding of the network of trust?

34:19.240 --> 34:21.040
I don't think anyone trusts anybody, you know?

34:21.040 --> 34:23.040
I mean, I think Ross had his advisors of trust,

34:23.040 --> 34:25.000
but outside of that, I mean,

34:25.000 --> 34:28.240
he required people to send their ID for their trust.

34:28.240 --> 34:31.400
He, you know, people stole from him.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.320
There was, there's open cases of that.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.600
It's a criminal world.

34:36.600 --> 34:37.880
You can't trust anybody.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.800
What was his life like, you think?

34:41.720 --> 34:42.560
Lonely.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.040
Can you imagine being trapped in something like that

34:45.040 --> 34:47.440
where your whole world focused on that

34:47.440 --> 34:50.000
and you can't tell people what you do all day?

34:50.000 --> 34:51.320
Could he have walked away?

34:53.280 --> 34:56.200
Like someone else take over the site just shut down.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.040
Either one.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.520
Just you putting yourself in his shoes,

34:59.520 --> 35:02.160
the loneliness, the anxiety,

35:02.920 --> 35:05.400
just the growing immensity of it.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.400
So walk away with some kind of financial stability.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.400
I couldn't have made it past two days.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.920
I don't like loneliness.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.360
I mean, if my wife's away,

35:15.360 --> 35:18.000
I'd probably call her 10, 12 times a day.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.200
We just talk about things, you know?

35:19.200 --> 35:20.720
I just, you know, something crossed my mind.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.560
I want to talk about it.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.000
And I'm sure she-

35:23.000 --> 35:24.800
And you'd like to talk to her, like honestly,

35:24.800 --> 35:25.640
about everything.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.040
So if you were running so crooked,

35:28.040 --> 35:31.200
you wouldn't be able to like...

35:31.240 --> 35:32.360
Hopefully I'd have a little protection.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.120
I'd only mentioned to her when we were in bed

35:35.120 --> 35:37.800
to have that marital connection.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.640
But who knows?

35:38.640 --> 35:41.480
I mean, she's going to question why the Ferrari is outside

35:41.480 --> 35:42.960
and things like that.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.800
Yeah.

35:44.840 --> 35:46.440
Well, I'm sure you can come up with something.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.920
Why didn't he walk away?

35:47.920 --> 35:49.800
It's another question of why don't criminals

35:49.800 --> 35:51.960
walk away in these situations?

35:51.960 --> 35:53.800
Well, I mean, I don't know every criminal mind

35:53.800 --> 35:54.640
and some do.

35:54.640 --> 35:55.960
I mean, AV unit walked away.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.680
I mean, not to go back to that son of a bitch, but-

35:59.840 --> 36:00.800
There's a theme to this.

36:01.640 --> 36:04.360
But Ross started counting his dollars.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.080
I mean, he really kept track of how much money he was making

36:07.080 --> 36:09.520
and it started getting exponentially growth.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.120
I mean, if he would have stayed at it,

36:12.120 --> 36:13.880
he would have probably been one of the richest people

36:13.880 --> 36:14.960
in the world.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.840
And do you think he liked the actual money

36:17.840 --> 36:20.240
or the fact of the number growing?

36:20.240 --> 36:22.080
I mean, have you ever held a Bitcoin?

36:22.080 --> 36:22.920
Yeah.

36:22.920 --> 36:23.740
Oh, you have?

36:23.740 --> 36:24.580
Well, he never did.

36:24.580 --> 36:25.420
What do you mean held a Bitcoin?

36:25.420 --> 36:26.240
You can't hold it.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.080
It's not real.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.240
It's not like I can give you a briefcase of Bitcoin

36:29.240 --> 36:31.120
or something like that.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.600
He liked the idea of it growing.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.520
He liked the idea.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.680
I mean, I think it started off as sharing this idea,

36:35.680 --> 36:37.560
but then he really did turn to like,

36:37.560 --> 36:40.440
I am the captain of this ship and that's what goes.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.800
And he was making a lot of money.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.960
And again, my interactions with Ross was about

36:48.560 --> 36:52.360
maybe five or six hours over a two-day period.

36:53.640 --> 36:56.080
I knew DPR because I read his words and all that.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.760
I didn't really know Ross.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.920
There was a journal found on his computer.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.920
And so it sort of kind of gave me a little insight.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.520
So I don't like to do a playbook for criminals,

37:06.520 --> 37:09.880
but I'll tell you right now, don't write things down.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.440
There was a big fad about people,

37:11.440 --> 37:12.520
like remember kids going around

37:12.520 --> 37:14.880
and shooting people with paintballs and filming it?

37:14.880 --> 37:16.120
I don't know why you would do that.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.440
Why would you videotape yourself committing crime

37:18.440 --> 37:19.320
and then publish it?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.960
Like if there's one thing I've taught my children,

37:21.960 --> 37:23.720
don't record yourself doing bad things.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.280
It never goes well.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.920
You actually give advice on the other end of logs

37:27.920 --> 37:30.400
being very useful for the defense perspective.

37:34.240 --> 37:37.320
Information is useful for being able to figure out

37:37.320 --> 37:39.280
what the attacks were all about.

37:39.280 --> 37:41.360
Logs are the only reason I found Hector Montsegur.

37:41.360 --> 37:46.360
I mean, the one time his VPN dropped during a Fox hack

37:46.760 --> 37:48.360
and he says he did, it wasn't even hacking.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.200
He just was sent a link and he clicked on it.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.560
And in 10 million lines of logs,

37:52.560 --> 37:54.560
there was one IP address that stuck out.

37:55.840 --> 37:56.840
This is fascinating.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.480
We'll explore several angles of that.

37:58.480 --> 38:03.480
So what was the process of bringing down Ross

38:04.760 --> 38:06.680
and the Silk Road?

38:06.680 --> 38:07.840
All right, so that's a long story.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.640
You want the whole thing or you wanna break it up?

38:09.640 --> 38:11.640
Let's start at the beginning.

38:11.640 --> 38:15.840
Once we had the information of the chat logs

38:15.840 --> 38:18.160
and all that from the server, we found-

38:18.160 --> 38:19.000
What's the server?

38:19.000 --> 38:19.960
What's the chat log?

38:19.960 --> 38:23.880
So the .Onion was running the website, the Silk Road,

38:23.920 --> 38:27.040
was running on a server in Iceland.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.440
How did you figure that out?

38:28.440 --> 38:31.680
That was one of the claims that the NSA-

38:31.680 --> 38:34.080
Yeah, that's the one that we said that,

38:34.080 --> 38:35.720
yeah, I wouldn't tell you if it was.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.560
It's on the internet.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.160
I mean, the internet has their conspiracy theories

38:38.160 --> 38:39.480
and all that, so.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.800
But you figure out, that's the part of the thing you do.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.240
It's puzzle pieces and you have to put them together

38:44.240 --> 38:45.960
and look for different pieces of information

38:45.960 --> 38:47.440
and figure out, okay, so you figure out

38:47.440 --> 38:48.480
the server is in Iceland.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.760
We get a copy of it and so we start getting clues

38:50.760 --> 38:51.600
off of that.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.080
With the physical copy of the server?

38:53.080 --> 38:55.920
Yeah, you fly over there, so you go.

38:55.920 --> 38:57.440
If you've ever been to Iceland, if you've never been,

38:57.440 --> 38:58.960
you should definitely go to Iceland.

38:58.960 --> 38:59.800
Is it beautiful or-

38:59.800 --> 39:00.640
I love it, I love it.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.120
It was, so I'll tell you this.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.160
So, sorry, tangents, right?

39:04.160 --> 39:05.360
I love this, yeah.

39:05.360 --> 39:09.040
So I went to Iceland for the anonymous case,

39:09.040 --> 39:10.840
then I went to Iceland for the Silk Road case

39:10.840 --> 39:13.720
and I was like, oh shit, all cybercrime goes through Iceland.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.040
It was just my sort of thing.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.880
And I was over there for like the third time

39:16.880 --> 39:19.400
and I said, if I ever can bring my family here.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.920
Like I said, there's a place called Thingavar

39:20.920 --> 39:22.280
and I'm sure I'm fucking up the name,

39:22.400 --> 39:24.040
Icelandics are pissed right now.

39:24.040 --> 39:27.440
But it's where the North American continental plate

39:27.440 --> 39:29.800
and the European continental plate are pulling apart

39:29.800 --> 39:33.480
and it's being filled in with volcanic material

39:33.480 --> 39:34.680
in the middle.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.320
And it's so cool.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.800
Like I was like, one day I'll be able to afford

39:39.800 --> 39:41.960
to bring my family here.

39:41.960 --> 39:42.800
And once I left-

39:42.800 --> 39:45.080
It's just like the humbling and the beauty of nature.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.000
Just everything, man, it was a different world.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.680
It was insane how great Iceland is.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.880
And so we went back and we rented a van

39:52.400 --> 39:56.600
and we took friends and we drove around the entire country.

39:57.840 --> 40:01.280
Absolutely, like a beautiful place.

40:01.280 --> 40:04.040
Like Reykjavik's nice, but get out of Reykjavik

40:04.040 --> 40:06.120
as quick as you can and see the countryside.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.600
How is this place even real?

40:07.600 --> 40:08.840
Well, it's so new.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.800
I mean, that's so, you know, our rivers have been going

40:10.800 --> 40:11.920
through here for millions of years

40:11.920 --> 40:13.640
and flattened everything out and all that.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.040
These are new, this is new land being carved

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
by these rivers.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.080
You can walk behind a waterfall in one place.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.160
It's the most beautiful place I've ever been.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.920
You understand why this is a place

40:24.920 --> 40:26.880
where a lot of hacking is being done?

40:26.880 --> 40:29.760
Because the energy is free and it's cool.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.560
So you have a lot of servers going on there.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.520
Server farms, you know, the energy has come

40:34.520 --> 40:37.040
up out of the ground, geothermal.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.080
And so, and then it keeps all the servers nice and cool.

40:40.080 --> 40:43.280
So why not keep your computers there at a cheap rate?

40:44.360 --> 40:46.600
I'll definitely visit for several reasons,

40:46.600 --> 40:48.360
including to talk to AV unit.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.680
Yeah, he'll watch you there.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.440
Well, the servers are there,

40:51.440 --> 40:53.240
but they don't probably live there.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.280
I mean, that's interesting.

40:54.280 --> 40:58.120
I mean, the Pacific, the PSC, the time zones,

40:58.120 --> 41:00.360
there's so many fascinating things to explore here.

41:00.360 --> 41:01.200
But so you got-

41:01.200 --> 41:02.040
Sorry, to add to that,

41:02.040 --> 41:04.200
I mean, the European internet cable goes through there.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.320
So, you know, across the Greenland

41:06.320 --> 41:07.520
and down through Canada and all that.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.640
So they have backbone access with cheap energy

41:10.640 --> 41:13.680
and free cold weather, you know.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.520
And beautiful.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.640
Oh, and beautiful, yes.

41:16.640 --> 41:19.040
So chat logs on that server.

41:19.080 --> 41:22.800
What was in the chat logs?

41:22.800 --> 41:23.640
Everything.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.480
He kept them all.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.320
That's another issue.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.040
If you're writing a criminal enterprise,

41:27.040 --> 41:28.480
please don't keep, again,

41:28.480 --> 41:29.400
I'm not making a guidebook

41:29.400 --> 41:31.520
of how to commit your perfect crime,

41:31.520 --> 41:34.600
but you know, every chat he ever had and everyone's chat,

41:34.600 --> 41:38.200
it was like going into Facebook of criminal activity.

41:38.200 --> 41:42.560
Yeah, just looking at texts with Elon Musk

41:42.560 --> 41:45.320
being part of the conversations.

41:45.320 --> 41:46.400
I don't know if you're familiar,

41:46.400 --> 41:48.280
but they've been made public

41:48.280 --> 41:50.280
for the court cases going through,

41:50.280 --> 41:52.040
was going through, is going through,

41:52.040 --> 41:53.440
was going through with Twitter.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.240
I don't know where it is.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.480
But it made me realize that, oh, okay.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.640
I'm generally, that's my philosophy on life,

42:01.640 --> 42:05.800
is like anything I text or email or say publicly

42:05.800 --> 42:07.680
or privately, I should be proud of.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.080
So I tried to kind of do that

42:10.080 --> 42:13.680
because you basically, you say don't keep chat logs,

42:13.680 --> 42:18.680
but it's very difficult to erase chat logs from this world.

42:19.280 --> 42:20.360
I guess if you're a criminal,

42:20.360 --> 42:24.320
that should be, like you have to be exceptionally competent

42:24.320 --> 42:25.200
at that kind of thing.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.400
To erase your footprints is very, very difficult.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.400
Can't make one mistake.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.600
All it takes is one mistake of keeping it.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.640
But yeah, I mean, not only do you have to be,

42:34.640 --> 42:36.680
whatever you put in a chat log or whatever you put in an email,

42:36.680 --> 42:39.560
it has to hold up and you have to stand behind it publicly

42:39.560 --> 42:40.400
when it comes out,

42:40.400 --> 42:42.480
but if it comes out 10 years from now,

42:42.520 --> 42:43.720
you have to stand behind it.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.920
I mean, we're seeing that now in today's society.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.800
Yeah, but that's a responsibility

42:47.800 --> 42:49.560
you have to take really, really seriously.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.760
If I was a parent and advising teens,

42:52.760 --> 42:54.600
you kind of have to teach them that.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.880
I know there's a sense like,

42:56.880 --> 42:59.040
no, we'll become more accustomed to that kind of thing,

42:59.040 --> 43:02.160
but in reality, no, I think in the future

43:02.160 --> 43:05.240
we'll still be held responsible for the weird shit we do.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.360
Yeah, a friend of mine, his daughter got kicked out of college

43:07.360 --> 43:09.400
because of something she posted in high school

43:09.400 --> 43:11.560
and the shittiest thing for him,

43:11.560 --> 43:13.880
but great for my kids, great lesson.

43:13.880 --> 43:16.400
Look over there and you don't want that to happen to you.

43:16.400 --> 43:21.320
Yeah, okay, so in the chat logs was useful information,

43:21.320 --> 43:24.800
like breadcrumbs of what,

43:24.800 --> 43:26.800
of information that you can then pull out.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.880
Yeah, great evidence and stuff, I mean, obviously.

43:28.880 --> 43:29.720
Oh, evidence too.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.560
Yeah, a lot of evidence.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.680
Here's a sale of this much heroin

43:33.680 --> 43:35.960
because Ross ended up getting charged

43:35.960 --> 43:37.600
with a czar status on certain things

43:37.640 --> 43:41.600
and it's a certain weight in each type of drug

43:41.600 --> 43:45.160
and that you had like, I think it's four or five employees

43:45.160 --> 43:48.680
of your empire and that you made more than $10 million.

43:48.680 --> 43:52.160
And so it's just like what the narco traffickers

43:52.160 --> 43:56.920
get charged with or anybody out of Columbia, so.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.160
And that was primarily what he was charged with

44:00.160 --> 44:03.040
during when he was arrested is the drug.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, and he got charged with some of the hacking tools too.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.880
Okay, because he's in prison, what, for?

44:08.880 --> 44:11.520
Two life sentences plus 40 years.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.760
And no possibility of parole?

44:13.760 --> 44:14.720
In the federal system,

44:14.720 --> 44:16.920
there's no possibility of parole when you have life.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.920
The only way you get out is if the president pardons you.

44:22.920 --> 44:25.080
There's always a chance.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.480
There is, I think it was close.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.640
I heard rumors there was close.

44:29.640 --> 44:32.800
Well, right, so it depends, given, it's fascinating,

44:32.800 --> 44:35.880
but given the political, the ideological ideas

44:36.760 --> 44:39.160
that he represented and espoused,

44:39.160 --> 44:42.720
it's not out of the realm of possibility.

44:42.720 --> 44:45.000
Yeah, I mean, I've been asked before who,

44:45.000 --> 44:46.160
does he get out of prison first

44:46.160 --> 44:48.120
or does Snowden come back into America?

44:48.120 --> 44:49.800
I don't know, I have no idea.

44:49.800 --> 44:50.920
Snowden just became a Russian citizen.

44:50.920 --> 44:52.400
I saw that and I just, yeah,

44:52.400 --> 44:54.880
I've heard a lot of weird theories about that one.

44:54.880 --> 44:57.800
Well, actually, on another tangent, let me ask you,

44:57.800 --> 45:02.800
do you think Snowden is a good or a bad person?

45:03.920 --> 45:05.600
A bad person.

45:06.320 --> 45:08.000
Can you make the case that he's a bad person?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.040
There's ways of being a whistleblower

45:10.040 --> 45:14.040
and there's rules set up on how to do that.

45:15.640 --> 45:17.280
He didn't follow those rules.

45:17.280 --> 45:20.680
I mean, they, you know, I'm red, white and blue,

45:20.680 --> 45:22.120
so I'm pretty, you know.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.480
So you think his actions were anti-American?

45:24.480 --> 45:27.240
I think the results of his actions were anti-American.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.160
I don't know if his actions were anti-American.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.520
Do you think he could have anticipated

45:30.520 --> 45:33.560
the negative consequences of his action?

45:33.560 --> 45:35.480
Should we judge him by the consequences

45:36.360 --> 45:39.480
or the ideals of the intent of his actions?

45:39.480 --> 45:41.920
I think we all get to judge him by our own beliefs,

45:41.920 --> 45:44.520
but I believe what he did was wrong.

45:44.520 --> 45:49.360
Can you still man the case that he's actually a good person

45:49.360 --> 45:52.680
and good for this country, for the United States of America,

45:52.680 --> 45:56.920
as a flag bearer for the whistleblowers,

45:56.920 --> 45:59.400
the check on the power of government?

46:00.520 --> 46:04.520
Yeah, I mean, I'm not big government type guy, you know.

46:05.480 --> 46:07.280
It sounds weird coming from a government guy

46:07.280 --> 46:12.280
for so many years, but there's rules in place for a reason.

46:12.480 --> 46:16.480
I mean, he put, you know, some of our best capabilities,

46:16.480 --> 46:18.080
he made them publicly available.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.520
It really kind of set us back in the,

46:21.520 --> 46:23.040
and this isn't my world at all,

46:23.040 --> 46:25.400
but the offensive side of cybersecurity.

46:25.400 --> 46:27.880
Right, so he revealed stuff that he didn't need to reveal

46:27.880 --> 46:29.160
in order to make the point.

46:29.160 --> 46:30.000
Correct.

46:30.760 --> 46:35.760
So if you could imagine a world where he leaked stuff

46:35.920 --> 46:39.560
that revealed the mass surveillance efforts

46:40.520 --> 46:43.240
and not reveal other stuff.

46:44.800 --> 46:45.640
Yeah.

46:45.640 --> 46:46.720
Like, is the mass surveillance,

46:46.720 --> 46:48.840
I mean, that's the thing that,

46:48.840 --> 46:50.960
of course, in the interpretation of that,

46:50.960 --> 46:53.640
there's fear-mongering, but at the core,

46:53.640 --> 46:55.800
that was a real shock to people,

46:55.800 --> 47:00.800
that it's possible for a government to collect data at scale.

47:03.800 --> 47:06.960
It's surprising to me that people are that shocked by it.

47:06.960 --> 47:08.240
Well, there's conspiracies,

47:08.240 --> 47:13.240
and then there's actual evidence that that is happening.

47:13.960 --> 47:18.960
I mean, there's a lot of reality that people ignore,

47:19.440 --> 47:20.640
but when it hits you in the face,

47:20.640 --> 47:22.760
you realize, holy shit, we're living in a new world.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.080
This is the new reality,

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
and we have to deal with that reality.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.120
Just like you work in cybersecurity,

47:28.120 --> 47:31.920
I think it really hasn't hit most people

47:31.920 --> 47:36.720
how fucked we all are in terms of cybersecurity.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.600
Okay, let me rephrase that.

47:38.600 --> 47:41.960
How many dangers there are in a digital world,

47:41.960 --> 47:44.000
how much under attack we all are,

47:44.000 --> 47:47.600
and how more intense the attacks are getting,

47:47.600 --> 47:50.880
and how difficult the defense is, and how important it is,

47:50.880 --> 47:52.400
and how much we should value it,

47:52.400 --> 47:53.680
and all the different things we should do

47:53.680 --> 47:55.720
at the small and large scale to defend,

47:55.720 --> 47:58.240
like most people really haven't woken up.

47:58.240 --> 48:01.040
They think about privacy from tech companies.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.920
They don't think about attacks, cyber attacks.

48:03.920 --> 48:04.960
People don't think they're a target,

48:04.960 --> 48:07.800
and that message definitely has to get out there.

48:07.800 --> 48:10.800
I mean, if you have a voice, you're a target.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.480
If the place you work, you might be a target.

48:13.480 --> 48:15.840
So your husband might work at some place,

48:15.840 --> 48:17.440
because now people are working from home,

48:17.440 --> 48:19.880
so they're gonna target you to get access

48:19.880 --> 48:21.880
to his network in order to get in.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.680
Well, in that same way, the idea that the US government

48:25.680 --> 48:27.880
or any government could be doing mass surveillance

48:27.880 --> 48:32.880
on its citizens is one that was a wake-up call,

48:32.920 --> 48:37.920
because you could imagine the ways in which that could be,

48:39.880 --> 48:42.040
like you could abuse the power of that

48:42.040 --> 48:46.000
to control the citizenry for political reasons and purposes.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.200
Absolutely, you could abuse it.

48:48.200 --> 48:50.760
I think during the part of the Snowden League

48:50.760 --> 48:55.400
saw that two NSA guys were moderating their girlfriends,

48:55.400 --> 48:56.680
and there's rules in place for that.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.880
Those people should be punished for abusing that.

48:58.880 --> 49:02.960
But how else are we going to hear about terrorists

49:02.960 --> 49:06.240
that are in the country talking about birthday cakes?

49:06.240 --> 49:09.240
And that was a case where that was the trip word,

49:09.240 --> 49:12.680
that we're gonna go bomb New York City's subway.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.640
Yeah, it's complicated, but it just feels like

49:14.640 --> 49:17.280
there should be some balance of transparency.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.480
There should be a check on that power,

49:19.520 --> 49:22.640
because in the name of the war on terror,

49:24.400 --> 49:26.480
you can sort of sacrifice,

49:26.480 --> 49:29.720
there is a trade-off between security and freedom,

49:29.720 --> 49:33.080
but it just feels like there's a giant slippery slope

49:33.080 --> 49:36.040
on the sacrificing of freedom in the name of security.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.200
I hear you, and we live in a world where,

49:40.200 --> 49:43.880
well, I live in a world where I had to tell you exactly

49:43.880 --> 49:46.360
when I arrested someone, I had to write a 50-page document

49:46.360 --> 49:48.800
of how I arrested you and all the probable cause

49:48.800 --> 49:50.160
I have against you and all that.

49:50.160 --> 49:51.960
Well, bad guys are reading that.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.520
They're reading how I caught you,

49:53.520 --> 49:54.920
and they're changing the way they're doing things.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.200
They're changing their MO.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.280
They're doing it to be more secure.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.760
If we tell people how we're monitoring,

50:02.760 --> 50:05.440
what we're surveilling, we're gonna lose that.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.760
The terrorists are just gonna go a different way.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.400
And I'm not trying to, again, I'm not big government.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.760
I'm not trying to say that it's cool

50:12.760 --> 50:15.720
that we're monitoring, the US government's monitoring

50:15.720 --> 50:18.080
everything, big tech's monitoring everything.

50:18.200 --> 50:19.280
They're just monetizing it

50:19.280 --> 50:21.920
versus possibly using it against you.

50:21.920 --> 50:24.320
But there is a balance, and those 50 pages,

50:24.320 --> 50:25.920
they have a lot of value.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.880
If they make your job harder,

50:29.920 --> 50:33.640
but they prevent you from abusing the power of the job.

50:33.640 --> 50:34.480
Yeah.

50:34.480 --> 50:35.300
There's a balance.

50:35.300 --> 50:36.140
Yeah.

50:36.140 --> 50:37.520
That's a tricky balance.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.360
So the chat logs in Iceland

50:42.080 --> 50:46.360
gave you evidence of the heroin

50:46.400 --> 50:51.400
and all the large-scale czar-level drug trading.

50:51.480 --> 50:55.680
What else did it give you in terms of how to catch?

50:55.680 --> 50:56.800
It gave us infrastructure.

50:56.800 --> 51:00.920
So the Onion name was actually running on a server in France.

51:00.920 --> 51:04.200
So if you're in an only community through a back channel,

51:04.200 --> 51:07.640
a VPN, to connect to the Iceland server,

51:08.560 --> 51:13.560
there was a Bitcoin vault server that was also in Iceland.

51:14.400 --> 51:17.040
And I think that was so that the admins

51:17.040 --> 51:19.600
couldn't get into the Bitcoins,

51:19.600 --> 51:21.560
the other admins that were hired to work on the site.

51:21.560 --> 51:23.040
So you could get into the site,

51:23.040 --> 51:24.520
but you couldn't touch the money.

51:24.520 --> 51:26.440
Only Ross had access to that.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.400
And then another big mistake on Ross's part

51:29.400 --> 51:31.760
is he had the backups for everything

51:31.760 --> 51:34.080
at a data center in Philadelphia.

51:35.280 --> 51:38.200
Don't put your infrastructure in the United States.

51:38.200 --> 51:41.880
I mean, again, let's not make a playbook, but you know.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.480
Well, I think these are low-hanging fruit

51:43.480 --> 51:46.760
that people of competence would know already,

51:46.760 --> 51:50.960
but it's interesting that he wasn't competent enough to make.

51:50.960 --> 51:53.240
So he was incompetent in certain ways.

51:53.240 --> 51:56.080
Yeah, I don't think he was a mastermind

51:56.080 --> 51:58.360
of setting up an infrastructure

51:58.360 --> 52:03.120
that would protect his online business

52:03.120 --> 52:06.240
because keeping chat logs, keeping a diary,

52:06.240 --> 52:08.440
putting infrastructure where it shouldn't be,

52:09.280 --> 52:10.360
bad decisions.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.680
How did you figure out that he's in San Francisco?

52:15.720 --> 52:17.160
So we had that part with Jared

52:17.160 --> 52:18.720
that he was on the West Coast.

52:18.720 --> 52:19.560
And then-

52:19.560 --> 52:20.680
Who again is Jared?

52:20.680 --> 52:22.920
Jared Day-Eaggen was a partner.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.240
He was a DHS agent,

52:26.240 --> 52:30.680
worked for HSI Homeland Security Investigations in Chicago.

52:30.680 --> 52:32.480
He started his Silk Road investigation

52:32.480 --> 52:34.080
because he was working at O'Hare

52:34.080 --> 52:36.040
and a weird package came in,

52:37.000 --> 52:39.600
come to find out he traced it back to Silk Road.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.720
So he started working at a Silk Road investigation

52:42.720 --> 52:44.560
long before I started my case.

52:44.560 --> 52:46.880
And he made his way up undercover

52:46.880 --> 52:49.720
all the way to be an admin on Silk Road.

52:49.720 --> 52:53.040
So he was talking to Ross on a Jabber server,

52:53.040 --> 52:54.320
the private Jabber server,

52:54.320 --> 52:56.640
private chat communication server.

52:56.640 --> 53:01.160
And we noticed that Ross's time zone

53:01.160 --> 53:03.920
on that Jabber server was set to the West Coast.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.000
So we had Pacific time on there.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.480
So we had a region,

53:07.480 --> 53:09.600
1 24th of the world was covered

53:09.600 --> 53:11.960
of where we thought he might be.

53:11.960 --> 53:14.480
And from there, how do you get to San Francisco?

53:14.480 --> 53:16.520
There was another guy, an IRS agent

53:16.520 --> 53:17.840
that was part of the team

53:17.840 --> 53:22.840
and he used a powerful tool to find his clue.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.320
He used the world of Google.

53:26.320 --> 53:27.520
He simply just went back

53:27.520 --> 53:30.280
and Googled around for Silk Road

53:30.280 --> 53:31.880
at the time it was coming up

53:31.920 --> 53:36.120
and found some posts on like some help forums

53:36.120 --> 53:39.000
that this guy was starting an onion website

53:39.000 --> 53:41.120
and wanted some cryptocurrency help.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.880
And if you could help him,

53:42.880 --> 53:47.120
please reach out to ross.albrick at gmail.com.

53:47.120 --> 53:50.920
In my world, that's a clue, so.

53:50.920 --> 53:53.040
Okay, so that's as simple as that.

53:53.040 --> 53:56.480
Yeah, and the name he used on that post was Frosty.

53:56.480 --> 53:59.600
Yeah, so he had to connect Frosty

53:59.600 --> 54:01.360
and other uses in Frosty

54:01.960 --> 54:05.200
and here's a Gmail and the Gmail has the name.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.720
The Gmail posted that I need help

54:07.720 --> 54:09.840
under the name Frosty on this forum.

54:09.840 --> 54:12.560
So what's the connection of Frosty elsewhere?

54:12.560 --> 54:15.960
The person logging into the Philadelphia backup server,

54:15.960 --> 54:17.800
the name of the computer was Frosty.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.320
Another clue in my world.

54:21.320 --> 54:22.680
And that's it.

54:22.680 --> 54:24.240
The name is there,

54:24.240 --> 54:25.960
the connection to the Philadelphia server

54:25.960 --> 54:28.000
and then to Iceland is there.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.400
And so the rest is small details

54:30.400 --> 54:33.440
in terms of, or is there interesting details?

54:33.440 --> 54:35.480
No, I mean, there's some electronic surveillance

54:35.480 --> 54:37.640
that find Ross.albrick living in a house

54:37.640 --> 54:38.840
and is there, you know,

54:38.840 --> 54:41.560
is a computer at his house attaching to,

54:42.760 --> 54:44.800
you know, does it have Tor traffic

54:44.800 --> 54:47.400
at the same time that DPR is on?

54:47.400 --> 54:48.400
Another big clue.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.040
Matching up timeframes.

54:51.880 --> 54:54.840
Again, just putting your email out there,

54:54.840 --> 54:56.880
putting your name out there like that.

54:58.000 --> 55:00.200
Like what I see from that,

55:01.040 --> 55:03.080
just at the scale of that market,

55:03.080 --> 55:05.520
what just makes me wonder how many criminals are out there

55:05.520 --> 55:08.480
that are not making these low hanging fruit mistakes

55:08.480 --> 55:10.680
and are still successfully operating.

55:10.680 --> 55:13.920
To me, it seems like you could be a criminal,

55:15.280 --> 55:17.760
it's much easier to be a criminal on the internet.

55:18.960 --> 55:20.720
What else to you is interesting to understand

55:20.720 --> 55:25.600
about that case of Ross and Silk Road

55:25.600 --> 55:27.240
and just the history of it

55:27.280 --> 55:31.400
from your own relationship with it,

55:31.400 --> 55:33.080
from a cybersecurity perspective,

55:33.080 --> 55:35.680
from an ethical perspective, all that kind of stuff.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.440
When you look back, what's interesting to you

55:37.440 --> 55:39.680
about that case?

55:39.680 --> 55:42.280
I think my views on the case have changed over time.

55:42.280 --> 55:44.680
I mean, it was my job back then.

55:44.680 --> 55:46.960
So I just looked at it as of, you know,

55:46.960 --> 55:48.200
I'm going after this.

55:48.200 --> 55:52.560
I sort of made a name for myself in the bureau

55:52.560 --> 55:55.080
for the anonymous case and then this one was just,

55:55.080 --> 55:56.120
I mean, this was a bigger deal.

55:56.120 --> 55:57.960
I mean, they flew me down to D.C.

55:57.960 --> 56:00.600
to meet with the director about this case.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.680
The president of the United States

56:01.680 --> 56:03.640
was gonna announce this case, the arrest.

56:03.640 --> 56:06.720
Unfortunately, the government shut down two days before.

56:06.720 --> 56:07.640
So it was just us.

56:07.640 --> 56:08.800
And that's really the only reason

56:08.800 --> 56:10.520
I had any publicity out of it

56:10.520 --> 56:12.760
is because the government shut down

56:12.760 --> 56:15.240
and the only thing that went public was that affidavit

56:15.240 --> 56:17.400
with my signature at the end.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.040
Otherwise, it would have just been the attorney general

56:20.040 --> 56:22.480
and the president announcing the rest of this big thing

56:22.480 --> 56:24.360
and you wouldn't have seen me.

56:24.360 --> 56:26.200
Did you understand that this was a big case?

56:26.200 --> 56:28.600
Yeah, I knew at the time.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.400
Was it because of the scale of it or what it stood for?

56:33.440 --> 56:37.440
I just knew that the public was gonna react in a big way.

56:37.440 --> 56:38.600
Like the media was not,

56:38.600 --> 56:40.320
did I think that it was gonna be on the front page

56:40.320 --> 56:42.320
of every newspaper the day after the arrest?

56:42.320 --> 56:44.040
No, but I could sense it.

56:44.040 --> 56:47.120
Like I went like three or four days without sleep.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.200
When I was out in San Francisco to arrest Ross,

56:49.200 --> 56:52.320
I had sent three guys to Iceland to...

56:52.320 --> 56:54.600
So it was a three-prong approach for the takedown.

56:54.600 --> 56:58.320
It was get Ross, get the bitcoins and seize the site.

56:58.320 --> 57:00.720
Like we didn't want someone else taking control of the site

57:00.720 --> 57:02.600
and we wanted that big splash of that banner.

57:02.600 --> 57:04.480
Like, look, the government found this site.

57:04.480 --> 57:07.800
Like you might not wanna think about doing this again.

57:07.800 --> 57:08.640
So-

57:08.640 --> 57:10.120
And you were able to pull off all three?

57:10.120 --> 57:11.520
Maybe that's my superpower.

57:11.520 --> 57:13.840
I'm really good about putting smarter people on

57:13.840 --> 57:17.360
than I am to gather on the right things.

57:17.360 --> 57:18.200
You know, I've done-

57:18.200 --> 57:19.040
It's the only way to do it.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.440
In the business I formed, that's what I did.

57:20.440 --> 57:21.880
I hired only smarter people than me

57:22.440 --> 57:23.280
and I'm not that smart,

57:23.280 --> 57:26.720
but smart enough to know who the smart people are.

57:26.720 --> 57:28.560
The team was able to do all three.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.280
Yeah, we were able to get all three done.

57:31.280 --> 57:32.760
Yeah, and the one guy, one of the guys,

57:32.760 --> 57:34.880
the main guys I sent to Iceland, man, he was so smart.

57:34.880 --> 57:39.400
Like I sent another guy from the FBI to France

57:41.040 --> 57:43.720
to get that part and he couldn't do it.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.360
So the guy in Iceland did it from Iceland.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.280
They had to pull some stuff out of memory on a computer.

57:49.280 --> 57:51.360
You know, it's live process stuff.

57:51.360 --> 57:53.200
I'm sure you've done that before, but.

57:55.120 --> 57:55.960
I'm sure you did.

57:55.960 --> 57:57.200
Look what you're doing.

57:57.200 --> 58:01.280
You're, this is like a multi-layer interrogation going on.

58:03.440 --> 58:04.960
Was there a concern that somebody else

58:04.960 --> 58:06.280
would step in and control the site?

58:06.280 --> 58:07.120
Absolutely.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.120
We didn't have insight on who exactly had control.

58:10.120 --> 58:13.760
So it turns out that Ross had like dictatorial control.

58:13.760 --> 58:17.280
So it wasn't easy to delegate to somebody else.

58:17.280 --> 58:18.120
He hadn't.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.840
I think he had some sort of ideas.

58:19.920 --> 58:22.040
I mean, his diary talked about walking away

58:22.040 --> 58:23.200
and giving it to somebody else,

58:23.200 --> 58:25.200
but he didn't, he couldn't give up

58:25.200 --> 58:26.960
that control on anybody apparently.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.600
Which makes you think that power corrupts

58:30.600 --> 58:34.760
and his ideals were not as strong as he espoused about.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.960
Because if it was about the freedom

58:36.960 --> 58:41.560
of being able to buy drugs, if you want to,

58:41.560 --> 58:45.360
then he surely should have found ways to delegate that power.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.440
Well, he changed over time.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.600
You could see it in his writings that he changed.

58:50.440 --> 58:53.360
So people argue back and forth

58:53.360 --> 58:55.960
that there was never murders on Silk Road.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.440
When we were doing the investigation,

58:57.440 --> 58:59.760
to us, there were six murders.

58:59.760 --> 59:04.360
So there was, the way we saw him at the time

59:04.360 --> 59:06.400
was Ross ordered people to be murdered.

59:07.960 --> 59:09.720
People stole from him and all that.

59:09.720 --> 59:12.320
It was sort of an evolution from,

59:12.320 --> 59:13.680
oh man, I can't deal with this.

59:13.680 --> 59:14.520
I can't do it.

59:14.520 --> 59:15.340
It's too much.

59:15.340 --> 59:18.680
To the last one was like the guy said,

59:18.720 --> 59:20.320
well, he's got three roommates.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.000
It's like, oh, we'll kill them too.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.800
Was that ever proven in court?

59:24.800 --> 59:27.600
No, the murders never went forward

59:27.600 --> 59:31.120
because there was some stuff, problems in that case.

59:31.120 --> 59:33.520
So there was a separate case in Baltimore

59:33.520 --> 59:35.400
that they had been working on for a lot longer.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.760
And so, during the investigation,

59:37.760 --> 59:39.120
that caused a bunch of problems

59:39.120 --> 59:42.080
because now we have multiple federal agencies

59:42.080 --> 59:43.800
case against the same thing.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.760
How do you decide not to push forward

59:45.760 --> 59:48.600
the murder investigations?

59:49.520 --> 59:52.920
So there was a de-confliction meeting that happened in DC.

59:52.920 --> 59:56.320
I didn't happen to go to that meeting, but Jared went,

59:56.320 --> 59:58.040
this is before I ever knew Jared.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.400
And we have like televisions

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.160
where we can just sit in a room and sit in on the meeting,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.800
but it's all, you know, secured network and all that.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.420
So we can talk openly about secure things.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.640
And we sat in on the meeting

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.000
and people just kept saying the term sweat equity.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.160
I've got sweat equity,

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.880
meaning that they had worked on the case for so long

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.640
that they deserve to take them down.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.880
And by this time, you know, no one knew about us,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.840
but we told them at the meeting that,

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.120
well, we had found the server and we have a copy of it

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.640
and we have the infrastructure.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.840
And these guys had just had communications under covers.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.560
They didn't really know what was going on.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.640
And this wasn't my first de-confliction meeting.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.040
We had a huge de-confliction meeting

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.440
during the anonymous case.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.840
What's the de-confliction meeting?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.200
Within your agency or other federal agencies

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.800
have an investigation that if you expose your case

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.040
or took down your case would hurt their case

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:58.880
or the other way.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.440
Oh, so you kind of have a,

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.680
it's like the rival gangs meet at the table

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.320
in a smoke-filled room and then-

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.920
Less bullets at the end, but yes.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.760
Yes.

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:10.240
Oh boy, with the sweat equity.

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.080
Yeah.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:13.200
I mean, there's careers at stake, right?

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.320
Yeah.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.600
You hate that idea.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.720
Yeah, I mean, why would you, why is that a stake?

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.960
Just because you've worked on it long enough,

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.400
longer than I have, that means you did better?

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.240
Yeah.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.520
That's insane to me.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.040
That's rewarding bad behavior.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.840
And so the part of the sweat equity discussion

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.280
was about murder and this was,

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.160
here's a chance to actually bust them

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.800
given the data you have from Iceland

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.080
and all that kind of stuff.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.280
So why-

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.000
Well, they wanted us just to turn the data over to them.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:41.840
To them.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.840
Yeah, thanks for getting us this far.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.680
Here it is.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.200
I mean, it came to the point where they sent us,

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:50.920
they had a picture of what they thought Ross was

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.520
and it was an internet meme.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.520
It really was a meme.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.920
It was a photo that we could look up.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.040
Like it was insane.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.120
All right, so there's different degrees of competence

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.560
all across the world between different people.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560
Yes.

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.280
Okay, does part of you regret

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.000
because you pushed forward the heroin and the drug trade,

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.800
we never got to the murder discussion?

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.720
I mean, the only regretting is that

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.000
the internet doesn't seem to understand.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.080
They just kind of blow that part off

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.920
that he literally paid people to have people murdered.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:25.960
It didn't result in a murder

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.000
and I thank God no one resulted in a murder.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.400
But that's where his mind was.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.480
His mind and where he wrote in his diary

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.320
was that I had people killed and here's the money.

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.160
He paid it.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.480
He paid a large amount of bitcoins for that murder.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.880
So he didn't just even think about it.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.760
He actually took action, but the murders never happened.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.320
He took action by paying the money.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.760
Correct, and the people came back with results.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:50.000
He thought they were murdered.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.440
That said, can you understand and steal me on the case

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.760
for the drug trade on Silk Road?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.400
Like can you make the case

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.280
that it's a net positive for society?

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.480
So there was a time period

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.920
of when we found out the infrastructure

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.600
and when we built the case against Ross.

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.680
I don't remember exactly, six weeks, a month, two months,

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:14.800
I don't know, somewhere in there.

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.640
But then at Ross' sentencing,

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.560
there was a father that stood up

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.200
and talked about his son dying.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:22.640
And I went back and kind of did the math

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.040
and it was between those time periods

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.960
of when we knew we could shut it down.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:27.960
We could have pulled the plug on the server and gone.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.400
And when Ross was arrested,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.720
his son died from buying drugs on Silk Road.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:37.320
And I still think about that father a lot.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:41.080
But if we look at scale at the war on drugs,

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.720
let's just even outside of Silk Road,

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:48.040
do you think the war on drugs by the United States

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:52.120
has caused, has alleviated more suffering

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.960
or caused more suffering in the world?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.360
That might be above my pay scale.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:59.600
I mean, I understand the other side of the argument.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.520
I mean, people said that I don't have to go down

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.360
to the corner to buy drugs.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.920
I'm not gonna get shot on the corner

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.960
buying drugs or something.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.480
I can just have them sent to my house.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.840
People are gonna do drugs anyways.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.480
I understand that argument.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.600
From my personal standpoint,

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.520
if I made it more difficult for my children to get drugs,

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.520
then I'm satisfied.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:20.320
So your personal philosophy is that

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.840
if we legalize all drugs, including heroin and cocaine,

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.040
that that would not make for a better world.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.200
I don't, no, personally, I don't believe

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.480
legalizing all drugs would make for a better world.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.840
Can you imagine that it would?

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.640
Do you understand that argument?

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.240
Sure, I mean, as I've gotten older,

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.680
I've started to, I like to see both sides of an argument.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.000
And when I can't see the other side,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.120
that's when I really like to dive into it.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.280
And I can see the other side.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.520
I can see why people would say that.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.520
But I don't wanna be my race children in a world

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.520
where drugs are just free for use.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.320
Well, and then the other side of it is with Silk Road.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.080
Did, you know, taking down Silk Road,

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:07.280
did that increase or decrease the number

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.320
of drug trading criminals in the world?

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.280
It's unclear.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.360
Online, I think it increased.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.920
I think, you know, that is one of the things

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:18.440
I think about a lot with Silk Road

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.160
was that no one really knew.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.040
I mean, there was, you know, thousands of users.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:25.960
But then after that, it was on the front page of the paper

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.360
and there was millions of people that knew about Tor

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:29.680
and onion sites.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.840
It was an advertisement.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.680
You know, I would have thought,

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.560
I thought crypto was gonna crash right after that.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:36.000
Like, I don't like, well, people would now see

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.560
that bad people are doing bad things with crypto.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.400
That'll crash.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.680
Well, I'm obviously wrong on that one.

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:44.000
And I thought, you know, Ross was sentenced

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.240
to two life sentences plus 40 years.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.160
No one's gonna start up these.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.240
Dark markets exploded after that.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.120
You know, some of them started as, you know,

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.880
opportunistic, I'm gonna take those escrow accounts

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.880
and I'm gonna steal all the money that came in.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.120
You know, there were that.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.640
But, you know, but there were a lot of dark markets

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.600
that popped up after that.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.360
Now we put the playbook out there.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:09.960
But, and also there's a case for,

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:13.560
do you ever think about not taking down,

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:16.960
if you have not taken down Silk Road, you could use it

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.200
because it's a market.

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.280
It itself is not necessarily

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.520
the primary criminal organization.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.240
It's a market for criminals.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.480
So it could be used to track down criminals

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.080
in the physical world.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:31.880
So if you don't take it down,

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:35.040
given that it was, you know, the central,

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:36.720
how centralized it was,

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:40.360
it could be used as a place to find criminals, right?

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.200
As opposed to-

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.040
So the dealers, the drug dealers,

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:42.880
taking down the drug dealers?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.720
Yeah.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.400
So if you have the cart, get the cartels started,

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:48.240
get involved, you go after the dealers.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.240
It would have been very difficult.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.320
Because of Tor and all that.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:53.720
Because of all the protections anonymity.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.160
Decloking all that would have been

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.480
drastically more difficult.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.960
And a lot of people in upper management of the FBI

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.240
didn't have the appetite of running something like that.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.920
That would have been the FBI running a drug market.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.440
How many kids, how many fathers would have to come in

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.880
and said, my kid bought while the FBI was running a site,

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.800
a drug site, my kid died.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:17.760
So I didn't know of anybody in the FBI in management

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.360
that would have the appetite to let us run

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.560
what was happening on Silk Road.

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.360
You know, because remember at that time

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.280
we're still believing six people are dead.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.800
We're still investigating, you know,

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:29.960
where the hell are these bodies?

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.120
You know, that's pretty much why we took down Ross

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:33.960
when we did.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.800
We had to jump on it fast.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.360
What else can you say about this complicated world

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.080
that has grown of the dark web?

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.440
I don't understand it.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.960
It would have been something for me.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.520
I thought it was gonna collapse.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:52.120
But I mean, it's just gotten bigger

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.040
in what's going out there.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:55.880
Now, I'm really surprised that it hasn't grown

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.800
into other networks or people haven't developed

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.640
other networks.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.160
You mean like instead of Tor?

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.520
Yeah, Tor's still the main one out there.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.040
I mean, there's a few others

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:06.800
and I'm not gonna put an advertisement out for them.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.480
But you know, I thought that market would have grown.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.680
Yeah, my sense was when I interacted with Tor,

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:15.280
it was that there's huge usability issues.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.640
But that's for like legal activity.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.080
Because like if you care about privacy,

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.440
it's just not as good of a browser.

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:25.880
Like to look at stuff.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.200
No, it's way too slow.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.040
It's way too slow.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.960
But I mean, you can't even like,

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.920
I know some people would use it to like view movies

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.840
like Netflix, you can only view certain movies

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.680
in certain countries.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.920
You can use it for that, but it's too slow even for that.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.160
Were you ever able to hold in your mind

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.080
the landscape of the dark web?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.040
Like what's going on out there?

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.840
To me as a human being, it's just difficult

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.320
to understand the digital world.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.520
Like these anonymous usernames.

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.680
Like doing anonymous activity.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.200
It's hard to, what am I trying to say?

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.760
It's hard to visualize it in the way I can visualize

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.640
like I've been reading a lot about Hitler.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.200
I can visualize meetings between people,

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.200
military strategy, deciding on certain evil atrocities,

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.080
all that kind of stuff.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.000
I can visualize the people, there's agreements, hands,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.280
handshakes, stuff signed, groups built.

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:24.760
Like in the digital space, like with bots,

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.960
with anonymity, anyone human can be multiple people.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:30.440
Yeah, it's all lies.

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.280
It's all lies.

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.080
Yeah, it feels like I can't trust anything.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.920
No, you can't.

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:34.760
You honestly can't.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.520
And like you can talk to two different people

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:37.560
and it's the same person.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:40.360
Like there's so many different,

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:42.600
Hector had so many different identities online

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:47.120
of things that, the lies to each other.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:49.360
I mean, he lied to people inside his group

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.240
just to use another name to spy on,

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.800
make sure what they were talking shit behind his back

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.800
or weren't doing anything.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.960
It's all lies and people that can keep

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.840
all those lies straight, it's unbelievable to me.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.440
Ross Albrecht represents the very early days of that.

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:06.160
That's why the competence wasn't there.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.040
Just imagine how good the people are now.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.520
The kids that grow up.

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:12.600
Oh, they've learned from his mistakes.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.880
Just the extreme competence.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.760
You just see how good people are at video games,

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.720
like the level of play in terms of video games.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.880
Like I used to think I sucked and now I'm not even,

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.280
I'm not even in the consideration

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.880
of calling myself shitty at video games.

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.800
I'm not even, I'm like non-existent.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:37.680
I'm like the mold.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.480
Yeah, I stopped playing because it's so embarrassing.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.320
It's embarrassing.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.560
It's like wrestling with your kid

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.720
and he finally beats you and he's like,

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.200
well, fuck that, I'm not wrestling with my kid

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.400
anymore ever again.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:48.880
And in some sense, hacking at its best and its worst

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.720
is a kind of game and you can get exceptionally good

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.440
at that kind of game.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.280
And you get the accolations of it.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.880
There's power that comes along.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.200
If you have success.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.360
Look at the kid that was hacking into Uber

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.280
and Rockstar Games.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.120
He put it out there that he was doing it.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.520
He used the name, whatever hacked into Uber

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.840
was his screen name.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.160
He was very proud of it.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.640
One building evidence against himself.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.880
But he wanted that slap on the back.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.600
Look at what a great hacker you are.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.480
Yeah.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.120
What do you think is in the mind of that guy?

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.520
What do you think is in the mind of Russ?

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.720
Do you think they see themselves as good people?

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:31.120
Do you think they acknowledge

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.760
the bad they're doing around to the world?

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.160
So that Uber hacker, I think that's just youth

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.880
not realizing what consequences are.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.480
I mean, based on his actions.

01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:41.520
Ross was a little bit older.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.120
I think Ross truly is a libertarian.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.120
He truly had his beliefs that he could provide

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.360
the gateway for other people to live

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.240
that libertarian lifestyle and put in their body

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:55.400
what they want.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.320
I don't think that was a front or a lie.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.160
What's the difference between DPR and Ross?

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.960
He said, I have never met Ross until,

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.800
I have only had those two days worth of interaction.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.920
It's just interesting given how long you've chased him

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920
and then having met him,

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.440
what was the difference to you as a human being?

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.440
He was a human being.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.480
He was an actual person.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.440
He was nervous when we arrested him.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.320
So one of the things that I learned

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.320
through my law enforcement career is

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:26.800
if I'm gonna be the case agent,

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.600
I'm gonna be the one in charge of dealing with this person.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.880
I'm not putting handcuffs on him.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.320
Something else is gonna do that.

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.880
Like I'm gonna be there to help him.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.000
I'm your conduit to help.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.600
And so, right after someone's arrested,

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.000
obviously you've had them down for weapons

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.400
to make sure everybody's safety.

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.520
But then I just put my hand on their chest,

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:45.960
just feel their heart, feel their breathing.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.120
I'm sure it's the scariest day,

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:51.720
but then to have that human contact

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.200
kind of settles people down.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.640
Let's start thinking about this.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.680
I'm gonna tell you,

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.680
I'm gonna be open and honest with you.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:00.080
There's a lot of cops out there

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.720
and federal agents cops

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.760
that just go to the hard ass tactic.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.360
You don't get very far with that.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.880
You don't get very far being a mean asshole to somebody.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.160
Be compassionate, be human.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.680
And it's gonna go a lot further.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.120
So given everything he's done,

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.640
you're still able to have compassion for him.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.760
Yeah, we took him to the jail.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:22.560
And so it was after hours.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.040
So he didn't get to see a judge that day.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.840
So we stuck him in the San Francisco jail.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.600
I hadn't slept for about four days

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.720
because I was dealing with people in Iceland,

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.400
bosses in DC, bosses in New York.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.840
So, and I was in San Francisco.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.720
So timeframe, like the Iceland people were calling me

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.600
when I was supposed to be sleeping.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.680
It was insane.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.720
But I still went out that night

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.520
while Ross sat in jail and bought him breakfast.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.840
I said, what do you want for breakfast?

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.440
I'll have a nice breakfast for you.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.960
Cause we picked him up in the morning

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.760
and took him over to the FBI to do the FBI booking,

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.280
the fingerprints and all that.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.560
And I got him breakfast.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.240
I mean, and you don't get paid back for that sort of thing.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.880
I'm not looking, but out of my own-

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.920
Did he make special requests for breakfast?

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:04.680
Yeah, he asked for certain things.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.720
Can you mention there's that top secret FBI?

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.560
That's not top secret.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.360
I think he wanted some granola bars.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.600
And, you know, but I mean, he'd already had lawyered up.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.000
So we, you know, which is his right, he can do that.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.640
So I knew we weren't gonna work together.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.240
You know, like I did with Hector.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.680
But I mean, this is his last day.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:26.480
Most of the conversations have to be them with lawyers.

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:28.680
From that point on, I can't question him

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.520
when he asked for a lawyer.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.240
Or if I did, it couldn't be used against him.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.000
So we just had conversation where I talked to him.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.080
You know, he could, you know, could say things to me,

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.880
but then I would remind him that he asked for a lawyer

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.280
and he'd have to waive that and all that.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.320
But we didn't talk about his case so much.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.040
We just talked about like human beings.

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:49.080
Did he, with his eyes, with his words,

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.640
reveal any kind of regret?

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.440
Or did you see a human being changing,

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.040
understanding something about themselves

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.360
in the process of being caught?

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.080
No, I don't think that.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.400
I mean, he did offer me $20 million to let him go

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:06.400
when we were driving to the jail.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.680
Oh no.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.360
And I asked him what we were gonna do

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.160
with the agent that sat in the front seat.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.080
The money really broke him, huh?

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:13.920
I think so.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.640
I think he kind of got caught up in how much money it was

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.000
and how, you know, when crypto started, it was pennies.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.080
And by the time he got arrested, it was 120 bucks.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.560
And, you know, 177,000 Bitcoins, even today.

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.960
You know, that's a lot of Bitcoins.

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.320
So you really could have been,

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.680
if you continued to be one of the richest people

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.640
in the world.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:37.640
I possibly could have been if I took that $20 million then.

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.480
I could have been living,

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.680
we could have this conversation in Venezuela.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.000
In a castle, in a palace.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.040
Yeah, until it runs out.

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.520
And then the government storms the castle.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.360
Yeah.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.240
Have you talked to Russ since?

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.400
No, no.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.880
I would, I'd be open to it.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.120
I don't think he probably wants to hear from me.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.040
And do you know where, in which prison he is?

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.360
I think he's somewhere out in Arizona.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.840
I know he was in the one next to Supermax

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.000
for a little while, like the high security one

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.600
that's like shares the fence with Supermax,

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:10.760
but I don't think he's there anymore.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:11.840
I think he's out in Arizona.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.920
I haven't seen in a while.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.880
I wonder if he can do interviews in prison.

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.400
Some people are allowed to.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.960
So I've not seen an interview with him.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.600
I know people have wanted to interview him

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.400
about books and that sort of thing.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.040
Right, because the story really blew up.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.880
Did it surprise you how much the story

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.800
and many elements of it blew up?

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.640
Movies?

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.520
It did surprise me.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.320
My wife's uncle who I didn't,

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.440
I've been married to my wife for 22 years now.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.160
I don't think he knew my name.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.760
And he was excited about that.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.840
He reached out when Silk Road came out.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.400
So that was surprising to see.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.840
Did you think the movie on the topic was good?

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.560
I didn't have anything to do with that movie.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.720
I've watched it once.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.680
It was kind of cool that Jimmy Simpson

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:55.800
was my name in the movie,

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.640
but outside of that,

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:59.280
I thought it sort of missed the mark on some things.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.160
When Hollywood, I don't think they understand

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.120
what's interesting about these kinds of stories.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.240
And there's a lot of things that are interesting

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.760
and they missed all of them.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.000
So for example, I recently talked to John Carmack

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.080
who's a world-class developer and so on.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.200
So Hollywood would think that the interesting thing

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.800
about John Carmack is some kind of like shitty

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.800
like a parody of a hacker or something like that.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:31.800
They would show like really crappy emulation

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.480
of some kind of Linux terminal thing.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480
The reality is like the technical details

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.600
for five hours with him, for 10 hours with him

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.720
is what people actually wanna see.

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.280
Even people that don't program.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.320
They want to see a brilliant mind,

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.440
the details that they're not,

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.400
that even if they don't understand all the details,

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:49.520
they want to have an inkling of the genius there.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.200
That's just one way I'm saying like

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.720
that you wanna reveal the genius,

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.560
the complexity of that world in interesting ways.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.080
And to make a Hollywood almost parody caricature of it,

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:04.260
it just destroys the spirit of the thing.

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:09.260
So one, the operation FBI is fascinating,

01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:11.700
just tracking down these people

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.980
on the cyber security front is fascinating.

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.940
The other is just how you run tour,

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.780
how you run this kind of organization,

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:22.740
the trust issues of the different criminal entities

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:27.740
involved, the anonymity, the low-hanging fruit,

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.500
the being shitty at certain parts on the technical front.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.860
All of those are fascinating things.

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:35.620
And that's what a movie should reveal.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.220
Should probably be a series, honestly,

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.820
a Netflix series than a movie.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:41.140
One of them, an FX show or something like that.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.300
Kind of gritty, you know?

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.740
Yeah, yeah, gritty.

01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:44.740
Exactly, gritty.

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:48.220
I mean, shows like Chernobyl from HBO made me realize,

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:51.100
okay, you can do a good job of a difficult story

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:53.540
and reveal the human side,

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.380
but also reveal the technical side

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.260
and have some deep, profound understanding on that case,

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:02.220
on the bureaucracy of a Soviet regime.

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.740
In this case, you could reveal the bureaucracy,

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.700
the chaos of a criminal organization,

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.860
of a law enforcement organization.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:11.420
I mean, there's so much to explore.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.580
It's fascinating, I don't know.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.620
Yeah, I like Chernobyl.

01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.060
When I re-watch it, I can't watch episode three, though.

01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:19.300
The animal scene, the episode,

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.140
they go around shooting all the dogs and all that.

01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:21.980
I gotta skip that part.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:22.980
You're a big softie, aren't you?

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.420
I really am.

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:26.380
I'm sure I'll probably cry at some point.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:29.900
I love it, I love it, listen.

01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:31.380
Don't get me talking about that episode

01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.500
you made about your grandmother.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.660
Oh my God, that was rough.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.900
Just to linger on this ethical versus legal question,

01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:39.740
what do you think about people like Aaron Schwartz?

01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:41.100
I don't know if you're familiar with him,

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.140
but he was somebody

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.980
who broke the law in the name of an ethical ideal.

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:51.380
He downloaded and released

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.620
academic publications that were behind a paywall,

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:02.620
and he was arrested for that and then committed suicide,

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:06.660
and a lot of people see him, certainly in the MIT community,

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.540
but throughout the world as a hero,

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:15.420
because you look at the way knowledge,

01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:18.700
scientific knowledge is being put behind paywalls,

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:20.700
it does seem somehow unethical,

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:26.580
and he basically broke the law to do the ethical thing.

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.940
Now, you could challenge it, maybe it is unethical,

01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:36.980
but there's a gray area, and to me at least, it is ethical.

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.460
To me at least, he is a hero,

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.020
because I'm familiar with the paywall created

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:49.020
by the institutions that hold these publications,

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.860
they're adding very little value.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.220
So it is basically holding hostage

01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:57.940
the work of millions of brilliant scientists

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.420
for some kind of, honestly, a crappy capitalist institution.

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.340
Like they're not actually making that much money,

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.940
it doesn't make any sense to me.

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:13.940
It should, to me, it should all be open public access.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.820
There's no reason it shouldn't be, all publications should be.

01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:21.820
So he stood for that ideal and was punished harshly for it.

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.460
That's the other criticism, it's too harshly,

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:29.980
and of course, deeply unfortunately,

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.700
that also led to his suicide,

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.100
because he was also tormented on many levels.

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.060
I mean, are you familiar with him?

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.780
What do you think about that line

01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:40.140
between what is legal and what is ethical?

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.860
So it's tough, it's a tough case.

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:45.300
I mean, the outcome was tragic, obviously.

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.100
Unfortunately, when you're in law enforcement,

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.740
you have to, your job is to enforce the laws.

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.580
If you're told that you have to do a certain case,

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.300
and there is a violation of, at the time,

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:03.820
18 U.S.C. 1030 computer hacking,

01:22:05.980 --> 01:22:07.540
you have to press forward with that.

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.300
I mean, you have to charge,

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.780
you bring the case to the U.S. Attorney's Office

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.220
and whether they're gonna press charges or not.

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.660
You can't really pick and choose

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:18.940
what you press and don't press forward.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:21.020
I never felt that, at least that flexibility,

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:24.660
when you're a street cop and you pull somebody over,

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:26.420
you can let them go with a warning.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.220
So in the FBI, you're sitting in a room,

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.580
but you're also a human being.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:31.700
You have compassion.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:35.140
You arrested Ross, the hand on the chest.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.260
I mean, that's a human thing.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.940
But I can't be the jury

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.500
for whether it was a good hack or a bad hack.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.980
It's all, a victim has come forward

01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.420
and said, we're the victim of this.

01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.380
And I agree with you,

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:51.740
because again, the basis of the internet

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:53.620
was to share academic thought.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:55.780
I mean, that's where the internet was born.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:58.220
But it's not up to you.

01:22:58.220 --> 01:23:01.980
So the role of the FBI is to enforce the law.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.820
Correct.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:08.620
And there's a limited number of tools

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:10.860
on our Batman belt that we can use,

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.660
not to get into all the aspects of the Trump case

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.620
and Mar-a-Lago and the documents there.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.900
I mean, the FBI has so many tools they can use

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.820
and a search warrant is the only way they could get in there.

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.100
I mean, that's it.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.380
There's no other legal document or legal way

01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.700
to enter and get those documents.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:32.860
What do you think about the FBI and Mar-a-Lago

01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.220
and the FBI taking the documents for Donald Trump?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:37.660
You know, it's a tough spot.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.500
It's a really tough spot.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.580
The FBI has gotten a lot of black eyes recently.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:45.620
And I don't know if it's the same FBI

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.860
that I remember when I was there.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.780
Do you think they deserve it in part?

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:52.460
Was it done clumsily?

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.580
Their raiding of the former president's residence?

01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:01.460
It's tough.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.980
Because again, they're only limited

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:05.460
to what they're legally allowed to do

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:08.860
and a search warrant is the only legal way of doing it.

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.700
I have my personal and political views on certain things.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:15.420
You know, and I think it might be surprising

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:20.380
to some where those political points stand, but.

01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:23.060
You told me offline that you're a hardcore communist.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.260
That was very strange, very surprising to me.

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.900
Well, that's only who you tried to bring me

01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.060
into the communist party.

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:29.820
Exactly, I was trying to recruit you.

01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.420
Giving you all kinds of flyers.

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:37.460
Okay, but you said like, you know,

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.020
people in the FBI just following the law,

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:41.140
but there's a chain of command and so on.

01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.820
What do you think about the conspiracy theories

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:47.820
that people, some small number of people inside the FBI

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.380
conspire to undermine the presidency of Donald Trump?

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.060
If you would've asked me when I was inside

01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.260
and before all this happened, I would say it could never happen.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:58.220
I don't believe in conspiracies.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.700
You know, there's too many people involved.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.180
Somebody's gonna come out with some sort of information.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:04.900
But I mean, the more the stuff that comes out,

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.700
it's surprising that, you know, agents are being fired

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.140
because of certain actions they're taking inside.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:14.780
And being dismissed because of politically motivated actions.

01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:19.500
So do you think it's explicit or just pressure?

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.900
Just, do you think there could exist just pressure

01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:25.260
at the higher ups that has a political leaning

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:28.020
and you kind of maybe don't explicitly order

01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:29.900
any kind of thing, but just kind of pressure people

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:32.660
to lean one way or the other and then create a culture

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:34.180
that leans one way or the other

01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.820
based on political leanings?

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.700
You would really, really hope not.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.740
But I mean, that seems to be the narrative

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.340
that's being written.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:45.100
But when you were operating, you didn't feel that pressure.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.660
Man, I was such at a low level.

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:49.220
You know, I had no aspirations of being a boss.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:51.180
I wanted to be a case agent my entire life.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.100
So you love the puzzle of it, the chase.

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.180
I love solving things, yeah.

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:58.620
To be management and manage people and all that.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.980
And like, no desire whatsoever.

01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.580
What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:08.780
on Joe Rogan's podcast saying that the FBI

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:11.460
warned Facebook about potential foreign interference?

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.980
And then Facebook inferred from that

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.060
that they're talking about Hunter Biden laptop story

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.500
and thereby censored it.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.220
What do you think about that whole story?

01:26:25.220 --> 01:26:27.060
Again, you asked me when I was in the FBI,

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:28.940
I wouldn't believed it from being on the inside

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:30.100
and I wouldn't believe these things.

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.060
But there's a certain narrative being written

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:34.300
that is surprising to me that the FBI

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.180
is involved in these stories.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:38.860
But the interesting thing there is

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:41.340
the FBI is saying that they didn't really

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:42.300
make that implication.

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:45.620
They're saying that there's interference activity happening.

01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:46.940
Just watch out.

01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:50.300
And it's a weird relationship between FBI and Facebook.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:53.340
You could see from the best possible interpretation

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.860
that the FBI just wants Facebook to be aware.

01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:57.700
Because it is a powerful platform,

01:26:57.700 --> 01:27:01.780
a platform for viral spread of misinformation.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.180
So in the best possible interpretation of it,

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:07.700
it makes sense for FBI to send some information

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.700
saying like we're seeing some shady activity.

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:11.540
Absolutely.

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.620
But it seems like all of that somehow escalated

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:15.900
to a political interpretation.

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:18.900
I mean, yeah, it sounded like there was a wink-wink with it.

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:25.020
I don't know if Mark meant for that to be that way.

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.620
Again, are we being social engineered

01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:31.540
or was that a true expression that Mark had?

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:34.140
I wonder if the wink-wink is direct

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140
or it's just culture, really.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.060
Maybe certain people are responsible on the Facebook side

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:41.100
and have a certain political lean.

01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.140
And then certain people on the FBI side

01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:45.780
have a political lean when they're interacting together.

01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.220
And it literally has nothing to do

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.940
with a giant conspiracy theory,

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:54.580
but just with a culture that has a particular political lean

01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:57.660
during a particular time in history.

01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:02.660
And so maybe it could be a Hunter Biden laptop one time

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.620
and then it could be whoever,

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:09.580
Donald Trump Jr.'s laptop another time.

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:10.420
It's a tough job.

01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:11.620
I mean, if you're the liaison,

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.380
if you're the FBI's liaison to Facebook,

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.780
there are certain people that,

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.820
I'm sure they were offered a position at some point.

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:22.180
It seems there's FBI agents that go.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:25.780
I know of a couple that's gone to Facebook.

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:27.020
There's a really good agent

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:29.420
that now leads up their child exploitation stuff.

01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:33.900
Another squad mate runs their internal investigations,

01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:35.060
both great investigators.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.820
So there's good money,

01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:38.780
especially when you're an FBI agent that's capped out

01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:42.660
at a 1310 or whatever pay scale you're capped out at.

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:49.060
It's alluring to be, maybe want to please them

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.700
and be asked to join them.

01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.300
Yeah.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.140
And over time that corrupts.

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:59.620
I think there has to be an introspection in tech companies

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:01.660
about the culture that they develop,

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:05.860
about the political ideology, the bubble.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.980
It's interesting to see that bubble.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:12.980
Like I've asked myself a lot of questions.

01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:16.420
I've interviewed the Pfizer CEO,

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:20.420
which seems now a long time ago.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:23.980
And I've gotten a lot of criticism, positive comments,

01:29:23.980 --> 01:29:26.260
but also criticism from that conversation.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:28.220
And I did a lot of soul searching

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.620
about the kind of bubbles we have in this world.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:34.700
And it makes me wonder, pharmaceutical companies,

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:38.500
they all believe they're doing good.

01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:44.540
And I wonder, because the ideal they have

01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:49.300
is to create drugs that help people and do so at scale.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.940
And it's hard to know at which point

01:29:54.940 --> 01:29:55.780
that can be corrupted.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.180
It's hard to know when it was corrupted

01:29:57.180 --> 01:29:59.980
and if it was corrupted and where and which drugs

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:01.460
and which companies and so on.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:03.980
And I don't know.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.620
I don't know that complicated.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:07.060
It seems like inside a bubble,

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.700
you can convince yourself if anything is good.

01:30:09.700 --> 01:30:13.060
People inside the Third Reich regime

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:16.180
were able to convince themselves, I'm sure many,

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.900
just Bloodlands is another book

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:21.220
I've been recently reading about it.

01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.860
And the ability of humans to convince

01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:26.660
they're doing good when they're clearly murdering

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:31.420
and torturing people in front of their eyes is fascinating.

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.500
They're able to convince themselves they're doing good.

01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:35.140
It's crazy.

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:37.380
Like there's not even an inkling of doubt.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:40.340
Yeah, I don't know what to make of that.

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:43.740
So it has taught me to be a little bit more careful

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:45.500
when I enter into different bubbles

01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:51.540
to be skeptical about what's taken

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.580
as an assumption of truth.

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.820
Like you always have to be skeptical about

01:30:56.820 --> 01:30:59.580
what's assumed as true, is it possible it's not true?

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:04.300
If you're talking about America,

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.140
it's assumed that in certain places that surveillance is good.

01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:13.500
Well, let's question that assumption.

01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:15.540
Yeah.

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:18.780
And also it inspired me to question my own assumptions

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:23.540
that I hold as true constantly, constantly.

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:25.220
It's tough, it's tough.

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:26.060
But you don't grow.

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:28.300
I mean, do you want to be just static and not grow?

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.580
You have to question yourself on some of these things

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:32.820
if you want to grow as a person.

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:33.740
Yeah, for sure.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.300
Now, one of the tough things actually

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.340
of being a public personality when you speak publicly

01:31:38.340 --> 01:31:43.100
is you get attacked all along the way as you're growing.

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:48.100
And in part, a big softie as well, if I may say.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.060
And those hurt, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:54.060
Do you pay attention to it?

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:57.580
It's very hard.

01:31:58.660 --> 01:32:01.220
Like I have two choices.

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:04.340
One, you can shut yourself off from the world

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.740
and ignore it.

01:32:05.740 --> 01:32:07.100
I never found that compelling,

01:32:07.100 --> 01:32:09.700
this kind of idea of like haters gonna hate.

01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.540
Yeah.

01:32:10.540 --> 01:32:15.540
Like this idea that anyone with a big platform

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.820
or anyone's ever done anything has always gotten hate.

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.300
Okay, maybe.

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.700
But I still want to be vulnerable

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:25.340
where my heart and my sleeve really show myself,

01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:28.020
open myself to the world, really listen to people.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.260
And that means every once in a while

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.500
somebody will say something that touches me

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:35.740
in a way that's like, what if they're right?

01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:37.340
Do you let that hate influence you?

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:40.740
I mean, can you be bullied into a different opinion

01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:43.420
than you think you really are just because of that hate?

01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:45.180
No, no, I believe not.

01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:49.340
But it hurts in a way that's hard to explain.

01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:53.540
Like, yeah, it just, it gets to like,

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:56.940
it shakes your faith in humanity actually

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.620
is probably why it hurts.

01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:04.620
Like people that call me a Putin apologist

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:06.980
or a Zelensky apologist,

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.780
which I'm currently getting almost an equal amount of,

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:13.140
but it hurts.

01:33:13.300 --> 01:33:15.740
It hurts because I,

01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:22.900
it hurts because it damages slightly my faith in humanity

01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:28.620
to be able to see the love that connects us

01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:32.660
and then to see that I'm trying to find that.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:36.020
And that's, I'm doing my best in the limited capabilities

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.460
I have to find that.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:41.660
And so to call me something like a bad actor, essentially,

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.500
from whatever perspective, it just makes me realize,

01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:48.060
well, people don't have empathy and compassion

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.020
for each other.

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:51.340
And it makes me question that for a brief moment.

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:53.900
And that's like a crack and it hurts.

01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.860
How many people do this to your face?

01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.820
Very few.

01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.540
Yeah, it's online e-muscles, man.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.380
They're deflected.

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:05.660
I have to be honest that it happens

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:09.500
because I've hung around with Rogan enough.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.500
When your platform grows,

01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:13.380
there's people that will come up to Joe

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:16.620
and say stuff to his face that they forget.

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:21.260
They still, they forget he's actually a real human being.

01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.700
They'll make accusations about him.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.340
So does that cause him to wall himself off more?

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.900
No, he's pretty gangster on that.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:30.940
But yeah, it still hurts.

01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:35.500
If you're human, if you really feel others,

01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:39.060
I think that's also the difference with Joe and me.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:43.380
He has a family that he deeply loves

01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:45.580
and that's an escape from the world for him.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:50.100
There's a loneliness in me

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:52.500
that I'm always longing to connect with people

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.340
and with like regular people

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:57.740
and like just to learn their stories and so on.

01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:59.940
And so if you open yourself up that way,

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:02.860
the things they tell you can really hurt in every way.

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:05.460
Like just me going to Ukraine,

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.980
just seeing so much loss and death,

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.540
some of it is like,

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:16.180
I mean, unforgettably haunting.

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:18.700
Not in some kind of political way, activist way,

01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:21.340
or who's right, who's wrong way,

01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:25.540
but just like, man, like so much pain.

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.420
You see it and it just stays with you.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:29.620
When you see a human being bad to another human,

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:31.620
you can't get rid of that in your head.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:36.940
You can't imagine that we can treat each other like that.

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.060
That's the hard part, I think.

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.980
I mean, for me it is.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:42.500
When I saw parents,

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.820
like when I did the child exploitation stuff,

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:46.420
when they rented their children out,

01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.900
they literally rented infant children out to others

01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:51.180
for sexual gratification.

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.780
Like I don't know how a human being

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.260
could do that to another human being.

01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.060
And that sounds like the kind of thing you're going through.

01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.500
I mean, I went through a huge funk

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:01.860
when I did those cases afterwards.

01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.180
I should have talked to somebody,

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.620
but in the FBI, you have to keep that machismo up

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.420
or they're gonna take your gun away from you.

01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.180
Well, I think that's examples of evil,

01:36:13.780 --> 01:36:16.660
that that's like the worst of human nature,

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.980
but just because I have-

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.580
War is just as bad, I mean.

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.100
Somehow war,

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:26.780
it's somehow understandable,

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:29.260
given all the very intense propaganda

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:30.780
that's happening.

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:32.940
So you can understand

01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:38.220
that there is love in the heart of the soldiers

01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.860
on each side, given the information they're given.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.420
There's a lot of people on the Russian side

01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:45.020
believe they're saving these Ukrainian cities

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:46.460
from Nazi occupation.

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:50.900
Now, there is stories,

01:36:52.020 --> 01:36:54.780
there is a lot of evidence of people

01:36:54.780 --> 01:36:57.540
for fun murdering civilians.

01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:02.220
Now, that is closer to the things you've experienced

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.420
of like evil,

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:07.380
of evil embodied.

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:10.460
And I haven't interacted with that directly,

01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:13.380
with people who for fun murdered civilians.

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.060
But you know it's there in the world.

01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:16.260
You're not naive to it.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.940
Yes, but if you experience that directly,

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:22.140
if somebody shot somebody for fun in front of me,

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:23.780
that would probably break me.

01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:26.420
Like seeing it yourself,

01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:30.020
knowing that it exists is different than seeing it yourself.

01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:32.420
Now, I've interacted with the victims of that

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:35.300
and they tell me stories

01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:37.500
and you see their homes destroyed,

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.580
destroyed for no good military reason.

01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:42.540
It's civilians with civilian homes being destroyed.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.660
That really lingers with you.

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.500
But yeah, the people that are capable of that.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.900
But that goes with the propaganda.

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.180
I mean, if you were to build a story,

01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:53.980
you have to, you know, you have to have on the other side,

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:55.980
you know, the homes are gonna be destroyed.

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:59.580
The non-military targets are gonna be destroyed.

01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.460
To put it in perspective,

01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:04.740
I'm not sure a lot of people understand the deep human side

01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.660
or even the military strategy side of this war.

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:10.300
There's a lot of experts outside of the situation

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.380
that are commenting on it with certainty.

01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.340
And that kind of hurts me

01:38:13.340 --> 01:38:15.900
because I feel like there's a lot of uncertainty.

01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:17.180
There's so much propaganda,

01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:19.220
it's very difficult to know what is true.

01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.460
Yeah.

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:25.460
So my whole hope was to travel to Ukraine,

01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:27.460
to travel to Russia, to talk to soldiers,

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:29.740
to talk to leaders, to talk to real people

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:32.740
that have lost homes, that have lost family members,

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:36.060
that who this war has divided,

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:39.300
who this war changed completely, how they see the world,

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.540
whether they have love or hate in their heart

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:43.380
to understand their stories.

01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.700
I've learned a lot on the human side of things

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:47.140
by having talked to people.

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.420
But it has been on the Ukrainian side for me currently.

01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:52.860
Traveling to the Russian side is more difficult.

01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.900
Let me ask you about your now friend.

01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:02.020
Can we go as far as to say his friend in a Sabu,

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.700
Hector Massager.

01:39:04.980 --> 01:39:07.700
What's the story?

01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:09.940
What's your long story with him?

01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:13.300
Can you tell me about what is LALSEC?

01:39:13.700 --> 01:39:16.980
Can you tell me about what is LALSEC?

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:19.020
Who is Sabu?

01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:21.420
And who's Anonymous?

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:22.580
What is Anonymous?

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:24.460
Where's the right place to start that story?

01:39:24.460 --> 01:39:25.940
Probably Anonymous.

01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.940
Anonymous was a, it still is I guess,

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.380
a decentralized organization.

01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.580
They call themselves headless,

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.500
but once you look into them a little ways,

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.620
they're not really headless.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:41.620
The power struggle comes with whoever has a hacking ability.

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.100
That might be you're a good hacker

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.820
or you have a giant botnet used for DDoS.

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.500
So you're gonna wield more power

01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:52.100
if you can control where it goes.

01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:55.540
Anonymous started doing their hacktivism stuff

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.860
in 2010 or so.

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.340
The word hack was in the media all the time then.

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:03.100
And then right around then,

01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:06.340
there was a federal contractor named HB Gary Federal.

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.860
Their CEO was Aaron Barr.

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.700
And Aaron Barr said he was gonna come out

01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:13.020
and de-anonymize Anonymous.

01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.860
He was gonna come out and talk at Black Hat

01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:17.340
or Defcon or one of those and say who they are.

01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:22.340
He figured it out by based on when people were online,

01:40:22.380 --> 01:40:25.540
when people were in IRC, when tweets came out,

01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:28.380
there was no scientific proof behind it or anything.

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:30.100
So he was just gonna falsely name people

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.820
that were in Anonymous.

01:40:32.860 --> 01:40:34.340
So Anonymous went on the attack.

01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:36.820
They went and hacked in HB Gary Federal

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:38.260
and they turned his life upside down.

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:39.300
They took over his Twitter account

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:42.460
and all that stuff pretty quickly.

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:45.020
I have very mixed feelings about all of this.

01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:45.860
Okay.

01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:49.060
I get, like part of me

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:55.100
admires the positive side of the hacktivism.

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:56.460
Okay.

01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:59.420
Is there no room for admiration there

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.140
of the fuck you to the man?

01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:02.140
Not at the time.

01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.860
Again, it was a violation.

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:06.580
The 18 USC 1030, so it was my job.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.260
So at the time, no, in retrospect, sure.

01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:13.380
But what was the philosophy of the hacktivism?

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:17.540
The philosophically, were they at least expressing it

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.900
for the good of humanity or no?

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.580
They outwardly said that they were gonna go after people

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.980
that they thought were corrupt.

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:25.900
So they were judge and jury on corruption.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:27.500
They were gonna go after it.

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.700
Once you get inside and realize what they were doing,

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:33.020
they were going after people

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.100
that they had an opportunity to go after.

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.860
So maybe someone had a zero day

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:40.940
and then they searched for servers running that zero day.

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.460
And then from there, let's find a target.

01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:46.700
I mean, one time they went after a toilet paper company.

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:49.340
I still don't understand what that toilet paper company did,

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.820
but it was an opportunity to make a splash.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.380
Is there some way for the joke, for the lulls?

01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:56.500
It developed into that.

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.900
So I think the hacktivism and the anonymous stuff

01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:01.180
wasn't so much for the lulls,

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.020
but from that H.P. Gary Federal hack,

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.900
then there were six guys that worked well together

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.660
and they formed a crew, a hacking crew,

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:09.180
and they kind of split off into their own private channels.

01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:11.860
And that was lullsec or laughing at your security

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:12.820
was their motto.

01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:18.220
So that's L-U-L-Z-S-E-C, lullssec.

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:19.140
Of course it is.

01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:21.500
Lullssec.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:26.500
And who founded that organization?

01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:30.740
So Kayla and Sabu were the hackers of the group.

01:42:30.740 --> 01:42:33.100
And so they really did all the work on H.P. Gary.

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.180
And these are code names.

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.380
Yeah, these are online names, they're NICs.

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:44.460
And so that's all they knew each other as.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.300
They talked as those names.

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.500
And they worked well together

01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:49.940
and so they formed a hacking crew.

01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.900
And that's when they started the,

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:53.180
at first they didn't name it this,

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:54.740
but it was the 50 days of lulls

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:58.500
where they would just release major, major breaches.

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:00.540
And it stirred up the media.

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:03.780
I mean, they put hacking in the media every day.

01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.220
They had 400 or 500,000 Twitter followers.

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:11.060
You know, and it was kind of interesting.

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:14.420
But then they started swinging at the beehive

01:43:14.420 --> 01:43:18.140
and they took out some FBI affiliated sites.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:21.460
And then they started Fuck FBI Fridays,

01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:23.420
where every Friday they would release something.

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.060
And we waited it with bated breath.

01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:27.980
I mean, they had us hook line and sinker pissed.

01:43:27.980 --> 01:43:29.580
We were waiting to see what was gonna be dropped

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:30.420
every Friday.

01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:32.380
It was, it's a little embarrassing

01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:33.220
looking back on it now.

01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:35.300
And it says in their early 2010s.

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:38.500
Yeah, this was 2010, 2011, around there.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:42.660
They'll actually linger on anonymous.

01:43:42.660 --> 01:43:44.900
What do you still understand?

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:46.300
What the heck is anonymous?

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.460
Just a place where you hang out.

01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:49.980
I mean, it's just, it started on 4chan, went to 8chan,

01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:51.660
and then it's really just anyone.

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:53.620
You could be an anonymous right now if you wanted to,

01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:55.140
just you're in there hanging out in the channel.

01:43:55.140 --> 01:43:56.980
Now you're probably not gonna get much cred

01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.820
until you work your way up and prove who you are

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.620
and someone vouches for you.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:02.260
But anybody can be an anonymous.

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:03.460
Anybody can leave anonymous.

01:44:03.460 --> 01:44:04.900
What's the leadership of anonymous?

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:06.980
Do you have a sense that there is a leadership?

01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:08.540
There's a power play.

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:10.620
Now there's not someone that says

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.500
this is what we're doing and all we're doing.

01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:16.340
I love the philosophical

01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:18.740
and the technical aspect of all of this.

01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.820
But I think there is a slippery slope

01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:22.060
to where for the laws,

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:26.020
you can actually really hurt people.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:28.060
That's the terrifying thing.

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:31.460
When you attach, I'm actually really terrified

01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:33.380
of the power of the law.

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:38.020
The fun thing somehow becomes a slippery slope.

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:40.500
I haven't quite understood the dynamics of that,

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.380
but even in myself, if you just have fun with a thing,

01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:48.460
you lose track of the ethical grounding of the thing.

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:50.740
And so it feels like hacking for fun

01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:54.340
can just turn it, like literally lead to nuclear war.

01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:57.100
Like literally destabilize nations.

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.940
Yada, yada, yada, nuclear war.

01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.940
I could see it, yeah.

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:03.260
So I've been more careful with the law.

01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:07.900
Yeah, I've been more careful about that.

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.700
And I wonder about it because in internet speak,

01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:12.820
somehow ethics can be put aside

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.980
through the slippery slope of language.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:19.500
I don't know, everything becomes a joke.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.380
If everything's a joke, then everything's allowed

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.740
and everything's allowed,

01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.660
then you don't have a sense of what is right and wrong.

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:26.260
You lose sense of what is right and wrong.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:27.100
We still have victims.

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.460
I mean, you're laughing at someone.

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:30.220
Someone's the butt of this joke,

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:33.380
whether it's major corporations or the individuals.

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:35.580
I mean, some of the stuff they did was just

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.900
releasing people's PII

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:38.620
and their personal identifying information

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:39.460
and stuff like that.

01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:41.100
I mean, is it a big deal?

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.620
I don't know, maybe, maybe not.

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:45.620
But if you could choose to not have your information

01:45:45.620 --> 01:45:47.220
put out there, probably wouldn't.

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:51.740
We do have a sense of what anonymous is today.

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:54.540
Has it ever been one stable organization

01:45:54.540 --> 01:45:55.820
or is it a collection of hackers

01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:00.340
that kind of emerge for particular tasks,

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:05.060
for particular hacktivism tasks and that kind of stuff?

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:08.140
It's a collection of people that has some hackers in it.

01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:11.140
There's not a lot of big hackers in it.

01:46:11.140 --> 01:46:14.140
I mean, there's some that have come bouncing and bounce out.

01:46:14.140 --> 01:46:18.380
Even back then, there's probably just as many reporters

01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:22.620
in it, people in the media than hackers at the time,

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.660
just trying to get the inside scoop on things.

01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.740
Some giving the inside scoop.

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:31.020
We arrested a reporter that gave over the username

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:33.380
and password to his newspaper

01:46:33.380 --> 01:46:35.900
and just so he could break the story.

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:38.540
He trusted him.

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:44.700
Speaking of trust, reporters, boy, there's good ones.

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:45.540
There is good ones.

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:46.380
There are.

01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.220
There are.

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:50.420
But boy, do I have a complicated relationship with them.

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.580
How many stories about you are completely true?

01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:54.860
I mean, there's some people that make stuff up

01:46:54.860 --> 01:46:57.180
on the internet, and one of the things that,

01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:00.260
I mean, there's so many fascinating psychological,

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:03.940
sociological elements of the internet to me.

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.940
One of them is that you can say that Lex is a lizard, right?

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.940
And if it's not funny, so lizard is kind of funny,

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:15.820
what should we say?

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:22.300
Lex has admitted to being an agent of the FBI, okay?

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:27.260
Okay, you can just say that right and then the response that the internet will be like, oh is that true?

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:30.540
I didn't realize that they won't go like

01:47:31.580 --> 01:47:33.500
Provide evidence, please

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:35.660
Right. They'll just say like oh, that's weird

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:41.180
I didn't like I kind of thought he might be kind of weird and then it piles on it's like hey. Hey guys

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.340
Like here's a random dude on the internet just said a random thing

01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:51.660
You can't just like pile up as and then johnny 69 69 is now a source that says and then like

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:55.420
The thing is i'm i'm a i'm a tiny guy, but when it grows

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.700
If you're like have a big platform

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.340
I feel like newspapers will pick that up

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:06.300
And then they'll like start to build on a story and you never know where that story really started

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:08.860
It's so cool. I mean to me actually honestly

01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:14.220
It's kind of cool that there's a viral nature of the internet that can just fabricate truth completely

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:18.380
I think we have to accept that new reality and try to deal with it somehow

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:22.780
You can't just like complain that johnny 69 can start a random thing, but I

01:48:23.420 --> 01:48:24.540
I think

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:25.500
in the

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:31.820
Best possible world it is the role of the journalist to be the adult in the room and put a stop to it

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:37.420
Versus look for the sexiest story so that there could be clickbait that can generate money

01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:40.540
journalism should be about

01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:43.260
Sort of slowing things down

01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:47.260
Thinking deeply through what is true and not and showing that to the world

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:51.740
I think there's a lot of hunger for that and I think that would actually get the most clicks in the end

01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:52.940
I mean, it's that same pressure

01:48:52.940 --> 01:48:57.180
I think we're talking about with the fbi and with the the tech companies about controllers

01:48:57.180 --> 01:49:02.300
I mean the editors have to please and get those clicks. I mean, they're measured by those clicks

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:08.060
So, you know, i'm sure the journalists the true journalists the good ones out there want that but

01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.460
They want to stay employed too. Can I actually ask you really as another tangent the jared and others?

01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.860
They're doing undercover

01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:18.140
in terms of the

01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.900
tools you have

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:23.260
For catching cyber security criminals how much of is undercover?

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.900
Undercover is a high bar to jump over you have to do a lot to start an undercover in the fbi

01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:32.140
There's a lot of thresholds

01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.820
So it's not your first investigative tool step

01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:41.500
You have to identify a problem and then show that the lower steps can't get you there

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:44.060
Um, but I mean I think we

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:48.060
We had an undercover going on in the squad about all times when one

01:49:48.620 --> 01:49:51.980
Was being shut down or taken down. We were spinning up another one

01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:54.780
So it's a good tool to have

01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:56.860
You know and utilize

01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:01.420
Um, they're a lot of work. I don't think if you run one you'll never run another one in your life

01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:09.340
Oh, so it's like psychologically is it there's a lot of work just technically but also psychologically like you have to really

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.620
It's 24 7 you're inside that world like you have to know what's going on and what's happening you you know

01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:19.820
You're taking on you have to remember who you are when you're because you're you're a criminal online

01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:22.700
You have to go to a special school for it, too

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:26.220
Was that ever something compelling to you? I went through the school, but

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:31.260
I'm a pretty open and honest guy and so it's tough for me to to build that wall of lies

01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:35.020
Um, it's maybe i'm just not smart enough to keep all the lies straight

01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.940
Yeah, but a guy who was good at building up a wall of lies would say that exact same exactly

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:43.020
It's so annoying the way truth works in this world. It's like, uh

01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:49.740
People have told me like because i'm trying to be honest and transparent. That's exactly what an agent would do, right?

01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:53.740
Um, but I feel like an agent would not wear a suit and tie

01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:56.940
I wear a suit and tie every day

01:50:57.340 --> 01:50:59.820
I was a suit and tie guy you were yeah every day

01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:02.940
I remember one time I wore shorts in and the sac came in

01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:07.020
and this was when I was I was a rock star at the time in the bureau and I had shorts in and

01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:12.220
Uh, I said, sorry ma'am. I apologize for my attire and she goes you could wear bike shorts in here

01:51:12.220 --> 01:51:14.620
I wouldn't care. I was like, oh shit. That sounds nice

01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:18.220
I never wore the bike shorts, but yeah

01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:23.820
But see I don't see a suit and tie is constraining. I think it's it's liberating in sorts

01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:27.980
It's like uh shows that you're taking the moment seriously. Well, not just that people wanted it

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:33.580
I mean people expected when you're not you you are dressed like the perfect fbi agent when someone knocks on their door

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:37.740
That's what they want to see they want to see what hollywood built up is what an fbi agent is

01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:41.580
You show up like my friend. Oh one. He was dressed always in t-shirts and shorts

01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:44.300
People aren't going to take him serious. They're not going to give him what they want

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:49.260
I wonder how many place I can just show up and like sam from the fbi and start interrogating them

01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:55.020
Like at a bar probably like definitely if they've had a few drinks you can definitely well, but people are going to recognize you

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.300
That's the only problem

01:51:56.300 --> 01:52:01.340
That's another thing you start taking out a big big cases. You can't work cases anymore in the fbi your face gets out there

01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:03.980
Your name too. Yeah

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:09.660
Well, actually let me ask you about that before we return to our friend sabu, okay

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:13.260
You've you've tracked and

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:17.660
Worked on some of the most dangerous people in this world

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:19.660
um

01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:21.660
Have you ever feared for your life?

01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:25.660
So I had to make a really really shitty phone call one time

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:29.660
I was sitting in the bureau and this was right after silk road

01:52:30.780 --> 01:52:31.740
and

01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.740
Jared called me he was back in chicago

01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.980
And he called me and said hey

01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:41.660
Your your name and your kid's name are on a website for an assassination. They're they're paying to have you guys killed

01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:45.580
Now that these things happen on the black market they come up, you know

01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:47.180
And

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:50.620
You know people debate whether they're real or not, but we have to take it serious

01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:55.100
Someone's paying to have me killed me. So I had to call my wife and we have a word

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:59.260
In that if I said this word and we only said it one time to each other

01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.260
If I said this would this is serious drop what you're doing and get to the kids

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:08.380
um, and so I had to drop the word to her, um, and

01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:15.420
I could feel the breath come out of her because her she thought her kids were in danger and when they then at the time they were

01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:17.740
um

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.060
I wasn't in a state of mind to drive myself. So

01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:25.660
Uh an agent on the squad a girl named evelina. She drove me lights and sirens all the way to my kid's school

01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.300
um and

01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:30.860
We had locked I called the school we were in a lockdown

01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:32.300
um

01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:34.860
Nobody should get in or out especially someone with a gun

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.900
Um, the first thing they did was let me in the building with a gun

01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:40.460
So I was a little disappointed with that

01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:47.420
My kids were I think kindergarten and fifth grade or somewhere around there maybe they're closer second. I'm not sure where

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:53.500
Um, but all hell broke loose. Um, and we had to from there go move into a safe house

01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:57.100
Um, I live in new york city. Uh nypd surrounded my house

01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:03.340
The fbi put cameras outside my house. You couldn't drive in my neighborhood without like, uh, your license plate being read

01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:05.980
Hey, why is this person here? Why is that person there?

01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:09.180
I got to watch my house on an ipad while I sat at my desk

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:15.420
Um, but you know again, I put my family through that and it scared the shit out of them. Um,

01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:18.940
And that that's to be honest. I think that's sort of uh,

01:54:19.660 --> 01:54:22.780
My mother-in-law's words were I thought you did cyber crime

01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:29.660
And because during silk road I didn't tell my family what I was working on I'll talk about that

01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.900
So why I want to escape that I don't want to be there

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:34.540
You know, I remember that like so when I was in the fbi like

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:37.580
Driving in I used to go in at 4 30 every morning

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:40.460
Um, because I like to go to the gym before I go to the desk

01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:45.580
I'd be at the desk at seven so in the gym at five a couple hours and then then go

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:51.900
The the best time I had was that drive-in in the morning where I could just be myself

01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:54.460
I listened to a sports podcast out of dc

01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:00.940
Um, and I we talked about sports and you know the nationals and whatever it was the capitals

01:55:01.340 --> 01:55:04.860
You know, it was great to not think about silk road for 10 minutes

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.940
So, but that was my best time but but yeah again, so yeah, I I've had that move into the safe house

01:55:11.420 --> 01:55:15.180
I left my mp5 at home. That's the the bureau's machine gun

01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:18.940
Um showed my wife to just pull pull and spray

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.380
So, uh, but how often did you live?

01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:29.100
Or work and live with fear in your heart. It was only that time. I mean in my for actual physical security

01:55:29.340 --> 01:55:33.340
Um, then I mean after the anonymous stuff, I you know, I really

01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:36.140
Tightened down to my cyber security

01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:41.100
Um, you know, I don't have social media. I don't have pictures of me and my kids online

01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:45.740
I don't really if I go to a wedding or something I say I don't take my picture with my with my kids

01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:47.820
You know if you're going to post it someplace or something like that

01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:50.460
So that's sort of security I have

01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:52.460
um, but you know

01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:57.840
Just like everybody you start to relax a little bit and security breaks down because it's not convenient

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.120
But it's also part of your job so you're you're much better at

01:56:04.160 --> 01:56:10.000
Let me your job now and your job before so you're probably much better taking care of the low-hanging fruit at least

01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:17.040
I understand the threat and I think that's what a lot of people don't understand is understanding what the threat against them is

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.880
So so i'm aware of that what what possibly and I think about it, you know, I think about things

01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.200
I do remember so you you tripped a memory in my my mind

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.240
I remember a lot of times and I had a gun on my hip. I still carry a gun to this day

01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.920
Opening my front door and being concerned. What was on the other side?

01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:42.080
Leave walking out of the house. Yeah, because I couldn't see it. I remember those four o'clock head into the car

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:44.720
I

01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.720
I was literally scared. Yeah

01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:52.640
I mean having seen some of the things you've seen it makes you perhaps question

01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.040
How much evil there's out there in the world how many dangerous people there are they're out there

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:00.800
Crazy people even

01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:03.840
I there's a lot of crazy. There's a lot of evil

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:08.400
Uh, most people I think get into like cybercrime or just opportunistic

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:16.000
Not necessarily evil. They don't really know maybe think about the victim. They just do as it's a crime of opportunity, you know,

01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.240
I I don't label that as evil and one of the things about

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:23.840
One of the things about america that i'm also very happy about

01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:28.640
Is that rule of law despite everything we talk about there is

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.520
It's tough to be a criminal in the united states

01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:35.600
So like if you walk outside your house

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:39.440
You're much safer than you are in most other places in the world

01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:43.680
You're safer and and the system's tougher. Uh, I mean

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:48.080
Uh lulzac six guys one guy in the united states five guys other places

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:54.160
Um hector was facing 125 years those guys got slapped on the wrist and went back to college

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.440
You know different laws different places

01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:00.240
So who's hector?

01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:05.520
Tell me the story of hector. So this lulzac organization was started. So hector was before that in uh,

01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.640
He was he was in part anonymous. He was all he was doing all kinds of hacking stuff

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.920
But then he launched lulzac. He's old school hacker

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:18.880
I mean he he learned how to hack and I don't want to tell his story, but he he learned to hack

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.320
because he grew up in the lower east side of new york and uh,

01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.680
And picked up some nypd computers that were left on the on the sidewalk for trash

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.280
Yeah, taught himself how to it doesn't exactly look like a hacker for people don't know

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:34.160
He he looks I don't know exactly what he looks like but it's not

01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:37.920
Not a not like a technical not what you would imagine

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:42.080
But perhaps that's that's uh, that's a hollywood portrayal

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.640
Yeah, I think you get in trouble these days saying that uh

01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.200
That what a hacker looks like

01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:52.000
I don't know if they have a traditional look just like I said hollywood has an idea an fbi looks like yeah

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.880
I don't think you can do that anymore. I don't think you can say that anymore

01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:59.120
Well, he uh certainly has a big personality and charisma and all that kind of stuff

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:03.840
That's sabu. I can I can see him selling me anything

01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:10.960
That's sabu that's convincing me of anything, you know, they're two different people there's sabu and there's hector hector hector is a sweet guy

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:15.520
That he he likes to have intellectual conversations and like that's just a thing

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:19.600
He he'd rather you know, just sit there and have a one-on-one conversation with you

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:23.760
But sabu that that's a ruthless motherfucker and you first met sabu

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:31.280
I was tracking sabu. It's all I knew was sabu. I didn't know hector. So when did your paths cross in terms of tracking?

01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:36.000
When did you first take on the case the spring of uh, 11?

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:41.440
So it was through anonymous through anonymous and really kind of lulz sec, um

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:48.640
We were lulz sec was a big thing and it was pushed out to all the cyber, you know, 56 field offices in the fbi

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:53.200
Um, most of them have cyber squads or cyber units and so

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:56.400
You know, it was being pushed out there and it was in the news every day

01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:01.540
But it really wasn't ours so that we didn't have a lot of victims in our aor area of responsibility

02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.340
Um, and so we just kind of pay attention to it

02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:09.780
Then I got a tip that a local hacker in new york had broken into aol and so

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:16.340
Olivia olson and I she's another agent who she's still in she's a supervisor out in la. She's a great agent

02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:21.060
We went all around new york looking for this kid. Um, just to see what we can find

02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:28.420
And ended up out in statin island, uh at his grandmother's house. She didn't know where he was obviously why would she?

02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:30.900
Um, but I left my card

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:34.740
He gave me a call that night started talking to me and I said

02:00:35.140 --> 02:00:38.180
Let's just meet up tomorrow at the mcdonald's across from 26 fed

02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:43.460
and he came in and three of us sat there and talked and you know

02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:49.700
Gave me a stuff. He started telling me about the felonies. He was committing those days including that break into aol

02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.940
um, and then he finally says, you know, you know, I can give you sabu and

02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.340
Sabu to us was the kaiser's associate back and he was our guy. Uh, you know

02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:00.580
He was the guy that was in the news that was pissing us off

02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:04.020
So so he was part of the fbi fridays

02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:09.700
Sabu was yeah. Oh, he led it. Yeah. He was the leader of fuck fbi fridays. So yeah

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:15.300
What was one of the more memorable? Uh f triple f's

02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:22.020
I said what how how do you get why how and why do you go after the beehive?

02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:26.820
That's kind of intense you get you on the news. It gets you. It's the it's the the lulls

02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:31.620
It's funnier to go after the big ones, you know, and and they weren't getting like real fbi

02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:35.860
They weren't breaking into fbi mainframes or anything, but they you know, they were uh, you know

02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.060
Affiliate sites or anything that have to do a lot of law enforcement stuff was coming out. So

02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:42.820
but

02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:44.580
you know

02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:49.220
We looked back and so if this kid knew that sabu we maybe there was a chance we used him a little

02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.100
To lure sabu out, but we also said well, maybe this kid knows sabu in real life

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:58.580
And so we went and looked through the ips and 10 million ips. We find one and it blogged to him and so

02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:01.940
That that day sabu

02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.100
Someone had doxed sabu

02:02:04.260 --> 02:02:08.180
um, and we were a little afraid he was going to be on the run we had a

02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:13.940
Surveillance team and fbi surveillance teams are awesome. Like you cannot even tell their fbi agents

02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.020
It's it's it's they are really that good

02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:21.700
I mean there's baby strollers and all whatever you wouldn't expect an fbi agent to have so that's a little like the movies

02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:25.540
A little bit. Yeah, I mean it is true, but and but they fit into the area

02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:28.100
So now they're on the lower east side, which is you know, you know

02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:32.100
A baby stroller might not fit in there as well. You know somebody just laying on the ground or something like that

02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:38.820
Um, they really get play the character and get into it. So now I I can never trust a baby stroller. Yeah

02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:45.380
Probably should every every baby. I'm just like look at stare them suspiciously, especially if the mom's wearing cargo pants

02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:47.380
Well, she pushes it. So yeah, so if it's like a very

02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:54.580
Stereotypical mom stereotypical baby. I'm gonna be very suspicious. I'm gonna question the baby that baby's wired

02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:00.500
You know we raced out there and like our squad's not even full

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.540
There's only a few guys there and like I said, I'm I was a suit guy

02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.260
But that day I had shorts and a t-shirt on I had a white t-shirt on

02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:09.620
Um, and I only bring it up because sebu makes fun of me to this day

02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:14.180
So I had a bulletproof vest and a white t-shirt on and that was it. I had shorts too and all that but

02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:19.700
Um raced over to there. We didn't have any equipment. Um, we brought our boss's boss's boss

02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:23.140
He stopped off at nyp. He got us like a ballistic shield

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:25.860
And a and a battery and ram if we needed it

02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:31.380
Um, and then we get to to hector's house sabu's house and he's on the sixth floor

02:03:32.020 --> 02:03:35.620
Um, and so normally, you know, we're the the cyber dork squad

02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:37.860
We'll hop in the elevator

02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:41.460
Six floors is a long ways to go up and pull the proof vest and a ballistic shield but but

02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:46.580
We had been caught in an elevator before on a search. So we we didn't yeah took the stairs

02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:48.980
um

02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:50.980
We get to the top a tad winded

02:03:51.380 --> 02:03:55.780
But uh knocking the door and this big towering guy opens the door just slightly

02:03:56.260 --> 02:03:59.860
And he sees the green vest with big yellow letters fbi

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:05.700
And he steps outside. Um, yeah, can I help you? You know, it tries to social engineer us

02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:08.420
But eventually we get our way inside the house

02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:10.500
um

02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:16.820
You know, I noticed a few things that are kind of out of place. Um, there's a laptop charger and a flashing modem

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:20.340
And I said, well, do you have a computer here? He said no, there's no computer here

02:04:20.900 --> 02:04:25.780
Um, so we we knew the the truce and then the half lies and all that sort of thing

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:30.980
So it took us about another two hours and finally he gave up that he was sabu. He was the guy we were looking for

02:04:31.460 --> 02:04:35.060
Uh, and so we sat there and we kind of showed him sort of the evidence we had against him

02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:39.620
um, and you know from his words we sat there and talked uh,

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:45.700
Talked like two grown adults and you know, I gave him the options and he said well, let's uh,

02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:48.420
Let's talk about working together

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:51.640
So he chose to become an informant

02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:55.380
I don't think he chose that night, but that's where it kind of went to

02:04:55.780 --> 02:04:59.380
Um, so the the we brought him down to the fbi that night

02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:03.700
Um, which was it was a funny trip because i'm sitting in the back seat of the car with him

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:06.660
Um, and I was getting calls from all over

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:10.740
Uh the us from different fbi agents saying that we arrested the wrong guy

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:15.460
And I was like, I don't think so and they're like, why do you think so? I was like because he says it's him

02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:20.340
Uh, and they still said nope the wrong guy. So I said, well, we'll see how it plays out

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.780
That's so interesting because it's such a strange world

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:29.540
Such a strange world because it's it's tough to because you still have to prove it's the same guy, right?

02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.100
Because the anonymity

02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:38.580
Yeah, I mean we had his laptop by the you know that point yeah him saying that helped I gave him a clue in my world

02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:43.140
Yeah, yeah, but yeah if he would have fought it

02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:47.300
I mean that definitely would have come in as evidence that ever if your agents are saying it's not him

02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:50.340
You have to disclose that stuff. So he had a lot of stuff on him

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:57.620
Um, what was he facing if um, he was facing 125 years 125 years in prison

02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:02.660
That's that now that's if you took every charge we had against him and put them, you know, uh,

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:08.500
Consecutively no no one ever gets charged that but yeah, he had essentially it would have been under 25 years

02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:13.220
You know fast forward to the end. He got thanked by the judge for his service after nine months

02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:16.020
And he walked out of the court of free man

02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:20.660
But that's being while being an informant. Yes

02:06:22.500 --> 02:06:24.580
Well, so

02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:26.660
The word informant here really isn't

02:06:27.700 --> 02:06:32.500
That good it does it's not fitting that that's technically I guess that's what he was

02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:37.300
But he didn't know the other people it was all or not. He knew nicks and all that

02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:42.340
Um, he really gave us the insight of what was happening in the hacker world

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:46.660
Like I said, he was an old school hacker. He was back when hackers didn't work together with anonymous

02:06:46.740 --> 02:06:50.420
He you know, he was down, you know a cult of dead cow and those type guys like way back

02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:57.380
Um, and he was around for that. He's like an encyclopedia of hacking but you know, we like his prime was in the 90s

02:06:58.340 --> 02:06:59.620
For terror hack, but yeah

02:06:59.620 --> 02:07:05.220
He kind of came back when uh when anonymous started going after mastercard and paypal and all that do the wiki leak stuff

02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:10.900
But even that little interaction being an informant. He probably made a lot of enemies

02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:13.300
Does how do you protect a guy like that?

02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:15.940
He made enemies after it was revealed. Yeah

02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:19.460
How does the fbi protect him? Yeah, good luck

02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:25.140
Uh, I mean perhaps i'll talk to him one day, uh, but

02:07:25.700 --> 02:07:27.780
Uh, is that guy afraid for his life?

02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:34.420
I again, I think it doesn't seem like it. He has very good security for himself cyber security

02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.100
um

02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:41.700
But you know, uh, yeah, he doesn't like the negative things said about him online. Uh, I don't think anybody does

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:46.900
um, but you know, I think it's so many years of the internet kind of

02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:51.700
Bitching at you and all that you get callous to it's just internet bitching

02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:57.300
And also the the hacking world moves on very quickly he he is kind of um

02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:00.900
He's yeah, like they're they're they're have their own wars to fight now

02:08:01.460 --> 02:08:06.420
And he's not part of those wars anymore. There's still people out there that that bitch and moan about him

02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.500
But but yeah, I think it's less

02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:12.820
Um, I I think you know, he he has a good message out there of you know

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:15.460
he

02:08:15.460 --> 02:08:17.620
Trying to keep kids from making the same mistakes he made

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.660
He tries to really preach that

02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:25.140
How do people get into this line of work

02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:30.820
Is there all kinds of ways being uh, not not not your line of work his line of work

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:40.020
Just all the stories you've seen of people that are in anonymous and lolsec and silk road and all the cyber criminals you've interacted with

02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:45.380
What's uh, what's the profile of a cyber criminal? I don't think there's a profile anymore

02:08:45.460 --> 02:08:50.180
You know, I used to be able to say, you know the kid in your mom's basement or something like that, but it's not true anymore

02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:54.820
You know like it's it's it's wide and it's like i've arrested

02:08:56.020 --> 02:08:58.980
I've arrested people that you wouldn't expect would be cyber criminals

02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:04.260
And it's in the united states. It's international. It's everything. Oh, it's international

02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:06.580
I mean we're seeing a lot of the big hack hackers now

02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:11.460
The big arrests for hackers in england surprisingly, you know, there's you know

02:09:12.260 --> 02:09:15.140
You're not going to see there's a lot of good hackers like down in brazil

02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:21.780
But I don't think brazil law enforcement is is good to hunt them down. So you're not going to see the big arrests how much

02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:24.820
state sponsored

02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:27.540
Cyber attacks are there do you think?

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.180
more than you can imagine

02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:36.660
And what what do you want to say an attack a successful attack or just a probing probing for information?

02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:39.460
just like feeling, you know

02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:42.900
Testing that there's where the attack factors are

02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:48.660
Trying to collect all the possible attack put a window seven machine on the internet forward face and then put a put a packet

02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:50.740
Sniffer on there and look at where the driver comes from

02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:54.900
I mean in 24 hours, you were going to fill up a hard drive with packets just coming at it

02:09:55.060 --> 02:10:01.620
Yeah, I mean, it's it's not hard to know. I mean, it's just constantly probing for entry points into things, you know

02:10:02.260 --> 02:10:04.740
You could you could go mad putting up honey pot

02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:07.460
Draws in intrusions, right? I see what

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:12.420
What's out there? Yeah, and it doesn't go anywhere. It maybe has fake information and stuff like that

02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:17.220
Um, you know, it's just kind of to to see what's going on and judge what's happening

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:19.380
Internet, you know

02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:25.060
Lick your finger and test the wind of what's happening these days the funny thing about like because i'm at mit

02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:30.260
That attracted even more attention for the not for the laws, but for the technical challenge

02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.900
It seems like people enjoy hacking MIT

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:35.860
It's just the amount of traffic MIT was getting for that

02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:40.100
In terms of just the sheer number of attacks from different places. It's crazy

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:44.500
Yeah, like just like that putting up a machine seeing what comes nasa used to be the golden ring

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:50.020
Now everybody got nasa that was like the early 90s if you can hack nasa. That was the now. Yeah. MIT is a big one

02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:52.260
Yeah, it's fun. It's fun to see

02:10:53.220 --> 02:10:55.220
uh respect

02:10:55.620 --> 02:11:01.220
Because I think in that case it comes from a somewhat good place because you know, they're not getting any money from MIT

02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.340
It's more for the challenge

02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:07.780
Let me ask you about that about this world of cyber security

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.700
um

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:12.820
How big of a threat are cyber attacks for companies and for individuals?

02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:15.860
Like let's lay out

02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:22.020
Where are we in this world? What's out there? It's the wild wild west and it's it's it's

02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:24.980
Uh, I mean

02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.140
People

02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:33.960
Want the idea of security, but it's inconvenient. So they don't they push back on it. Um, and there are a lot of opportunistic

02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:39.380
Nation-state financially motivated hackers hackers for the lulz. You got three different tiers there

02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.620
um, and

02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:46.500
They're they're on the prowl. They have tools. They have really good tools that are being used against us

02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:51.300
And at what scale so when you're thinking of um

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:59.460
I don't know what's let's talk about companies first. So say you're you're talking to um a mid-tier

02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:02.820
I wonder what the more most interesting business is

02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:07.140
So google let's let's we can look at large tech companies or we can look at

02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:09.380
medium-sized

02:12:09.380 --> 02:12:13.620
tech companies and like you are sitting in a room with a cto with a ceo

02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:19.620
And uh, the question is how fucked are we and what should we do? What's the low-hanging fruit?

02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:22.260
What's what are the different strategies and uh,

02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.180
Those companies should consider. I mean the problem is they want to push button

02:12:26.260 --> 02:12:31.860
They want to they want to out of the box solution that i'm secure, you know, they want to tell people they're secure

02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:37.460
But that's very challenging to have it's impossible. But like if I could if someone had it they'd be a billionaire

02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:42.180
Uh, you know, they'd be beyond a billionaire, you know, because that's what everybody wants

02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.060
So it's so it's you know, you can buy all the tools you want

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:50.020
It's configuring them the proper way and there's if anyone's trying to tell you uh that

02:12:50.580 --> 02:12:56.660
There's one solution that fits all they're staying close husband and there's a lot of people in cyber security that are staying close husband

02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:59.940
Yeah, and I feel like there's tools if they're not configured correctly

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:03.060
They uh, they just introduce

02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:07.860
They don't increase security significantly and they introduce a lot of pain for the people

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:13.220
They uh decrease efficiency of the actual work you have to do so like um, we had um,

02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:15.620
I was at google for a time

02:13:16.580 --> 02:13:18.580
and

02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:22.180
I think mostly I want to give props to their security efforts

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.500
but

02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.100
user data

02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:30.100
So like data that belongs to users is like the holy

02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:39.460
Like the amount of security they have around that is incredible. So most anytime I had to work with

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:46.180
Anything even resembling user data, so I never got a chance to work with actual user data anything resembling that first of all

02:13:46.180 --> 02:13:47.940
You have no access to the internet

02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:53.780
It's impossible to even come close to the access to the internet and there's so much pain to actually

02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:55.300
like

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.300
interact with that data

02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:04.020
Where it I mean it's it was extremely inefficient in places where I thought it didn't have to be that inefficient

02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:05.780
The security was too much

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:10.100
But I have to give respect to that because you in that case you want to err on the side of security

02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:14.980
But that's google. Yeah, they were doing a good job of this the reputational harm if it got out

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:20.020
I mean google, you know, why is google drive free, you know, because they want your data

02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.700
They want you to park your data there

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:28.420
So, you know if the if they got hacked or leaked information the reputational harm would be tremendous

02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.380
but you know for a company that's not

02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:36.980
It's really hard to do that right and the company's not as big as google or not as tech savvy as google

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:43.300
Might have a lot of trouble with doing that kind of stuff instead instead of increasing security. They'll just decrease the

02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.700
efficiency

02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:51.220
Well, yeah, so so there's a big difference between it and security and unfortunately these mid-side companies

02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:56.180
They try to stack security into their it department. Your it department is about business continuity

02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.420
They're about trying to move business forward

02:14:58.420 --> 02:15:00.180
They want your users to get the data

02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:05.460
They need to do their job so the company can grow security is not that they don't want you to get the data

02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:07.460
They you know, but there's there's

02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:10.340
Fine tuning you can do to you know

02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:16.420
Ensure that I mean as simple as like having good onboarding procedures for employees like like you come into my company

02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:21.940
You don't need access to everything. Maybe you need access to something for one day turn the axis on don't leave it on

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:22.340
I mean

02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:25.860
I was the victim of the opium hack the office of personnel management

02:15:26.260 --> 02:15:30.340
Because old credentials from a third party vendor were sitting there inactive

02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:34.500
And the chinese government found those credentials and were able to log in and steal all my information

02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:41.220
So a lot could be helped if you just control the credentials the access the access control how long they last

02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:43.380
and people who have

02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:45.380
Who need access to a certain thing?

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:48.100
Only get access to that thing and not nothing else and then

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:54.180
And it just gets refreshed like that access control, you know, you know, like we said setting up people leaving people leaving the company

02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:56.180
Get rid of their they don't need control

02:15:56.180 --> 02:16:00.740
Two-factor authentication, you know, that's a big thing. You know, we we it's I mean

02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:04.260
I sound like a broken record because this isn't anything new. This isn't rocket science

02:16:04.260 --> 02:16:07.460
The problem is we're not implementing it and we're not if we are we're not doing it correctly

02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:13.300
Because these guys are taking taking us. Well two-factor authentication is a good example of something

02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:19.540
That I just was annoyed by for the longest time because yes, it's very good

02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:22.740
But like it's it seems that it's pretty easy to implement

02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:28.900
Horribly to where it's like it's not convenient at all for the for the legitimate user to use

02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:31.220
It should be trivial to to do

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:38.740
Like to authenticate yourself twice should be super easy if security if it's slightly inconvenient for you

02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:43.060
It's think about how inconvenient is for a hacker and how they're just going to move on to the next person

02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:46.740
Yes, yes in theory when implemented extremely well. Yeah, but

02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:49.140
I I just don't

02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:51.540
think so I think actually if it's

02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:56.260
Inconvenient it shows that system hasn't been thought through a lot

02:16:56.740 --> 02:17:02.180
Well, do you know why we need two-factor authentication people using the same password across the same site?

02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:05.620
So when one site is compromised people just take that username and password

02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:08.260
It's called credential stuffing and just stuff it across the internet

02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:14.420
So if 10 years ago when we told everybody don't use the same fucking password across the internet across the vulnerable sites

02:17:14.660 --> 02:17:18.580
Maybe two-factor wouldn't be needed. Yeah, so you wouldn't need to factor if everyone did

02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:21.460
Good job with passwords. Yeah

02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:23.940
right, but i'm saying like

02:17:23.940 --> 02:17:29.300
The two factor authentication it should uh, it should be super easy to authenticate myself

02:17:29.940 --> 02:17:35.460
Uh in some with some other device really quickly like there should be it should be frictionless

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:39.060
Like you just hit okay, okay and anything that belongs to me

02:17:39.540 --> 02:17:40.500
Yeah

02:17:40.500 --> 02:17:45.540
And like I should it should very importantly be easy to set up what belongs to me

02:17:46.020 --> 02:17:53.460
Uh, I don't know the full complexity of the cyber attacks. These platforms are under they're probably under insane

02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:55.860
Amount of attacks. Yeah, you've got it right there that

02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:01.860
People have no idea these large companies how often they're attacked, you know on a per second basis

02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:06.180
And they have to fight all that off and pick out the good traffic in there. So

02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:10.180
Yeah, I wouldn't I'd there's no way i'd want to run a large tech company

02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:14.660
What about protecting individuals for individuals

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:19.540
What what's good advice for to try to protect yourself?

02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:26.420
From this increasingly dangerous world of cyber attacks again educate yourself that you understand that there is a threat first

02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:30.500
You have to realize that then then you're going to step up and you're going to do stuff a little bit more

02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:34.420
Sometimes I guess think I take that to a little bit extreme. I remember one time

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:39.060
my mom called me and she was uh screaming that uh,

02:18:40.260 --> 02:18:45.300
I woke up this morning and I just clicked on a link and now my phone is making weird noises and I was like

02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:50.980
Throw your phone in a glass of water. Just put it in a glass of water right now and she's I made my mom cry

02:18:51.140 --> 02:18:57.140
It was not a pleasant thing. Um, so sometimes I go to a little extremes on those ones, but but

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:02.580
Understanding is a risk and making it a little bit more a little more difficult to become a victim

02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:07.540
I mean just understanding certain things. Um, you know simple things like

02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:11.140
You know as we add more internet of the things to people's houses

02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:16.500
I mean how many wi-fi networks do people have it's normally just one and you're bumping your phones and giving your password to people to come

02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:21.860
To visit set up a guest network set up something you can change every 30 days simple little things like that

02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.060
Um, you know, I hate to remind you but change your passwords

02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:30.340
I mean, I feel like i'm a broken record again, but just make it more difficult for others to victimize you

02:19:30.980 --> 02:19:33.480
And then don't use the same password everywhere

02:19:34.500 --> 02:19:38.420
That that yes, I mean I still I still know people that do that

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:41.700
I mean ask.fm got popped last week two weeks ago

02:19:42.180 --> 02:19:47.300
And that's 350 million username and passwords with connected twitter accounts google accounts

02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:52.420
Uh, you know all the different social media accounts, you know, that is a treasure trove for the next

02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:57.220
Two and a half three years of just using those credentials everywhere

02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:02.980
Um using you'll learn even if it's not the right password you learn people's passwords styles, you know

02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:05.140
Bad guys are making portfolios out of people

02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:11.540
You know, we're figuring out how people generate their passwords and kind of you know figuring and then it's easier to crack their password

02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:17.380
You know, we're making a dossier on each person. It's 350 million dossiers just in that one hack yahu

02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:19.380
There was a half a billion

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:21.540
So the the thing a hacker would do with that

02:20:22.100 --> 02:20:26.740
is try to find all the link low hanging fruit like have some kind of program that

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.100
Yeah evaluates the strength of the passwords

02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:37.700
And then finds the weak ones and that means that this person is probably the kind of person that would use the same password across multiple

02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:41.780
Or even just write a program into that remember the ring hack a couple a year ago

02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:43.300
That's all it was is credential stuffing

02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:48.660
So ring the security system by default had two factor but didn't turn it on and they also had

02:20:49.220 --> 02:20:51.780
Don't try unlimited tries to log into my account

02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:56.260
You can lock it out after 10 by default not turned on because it's not convenient for people

02:20:56.660 --> 02:21:01.300
You know ring, you know, it's like I want people to stick these little things up and have security in their house

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:03.620
Uh, but you know cyber security

02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:06.100
Don't make it inconvenient that people won't buy our product

02:21:07.380 --> 02:21:12.260
That's how they got hacked. They wanted to say that it's insecure and got hacked into reputational harm right there for ring

02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:18.020
But they didn't it was just credential stuffing people bought username passwords on the black market and

02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:25.300
Just wrote a bot that just went through ring and used every one of them to maybe one percent hit but that's a big hit

02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:31.860
To the number of ring users, you know, you can use also password managers to make to make the changing of the passwords easier

02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:33.620
um

02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:38.900
And secure and to make you can choose the difficulty the number of special characters the length of it and all that

02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:41.880
Um, my favorite thing is on websites

02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:48.820
Yell at you for your password being too long or having too many special care or like, uh, or

02:21:49.380 --> 02:21:55.540
Yeah, you're not allowed to have this special character or something. You can only use these three special characters. It's you know

02:21:56.820 --> 02:22:02.580
Do you understand how password cracking works if you specifically tell me which pass what special characters I can use

02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:06.900
I want to like I honestly just want to have a one-on-one meeting

02:22:07.460 --> 02:22:12.420
Like late at night with the engineer that program that because that's that's like an intern

02:22:12.660 --> 02:22:14.340
I just want to have a sit-down meeting

02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:19.780
Yeah, I made my parents switch banks once because the security was so poor. I was like you just you can't have money here

02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:27.060
But then there's also like the zero-day tax like I mentioned I mentioned before the uh, the qnip nasa got hacked

02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:30.420
Luckily, I didn't have anything private on there

02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:37.060
Um, but it really woke me up until like, okay, so like if you take everything extremely seriously

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.820
Unfortunately for the end users. There's nothing you do about zero day. It's you know, there's this you have no control over that

02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:48.420
I mean, it's a it's a the engineers that made the software don't even know about it. Now, let's talk about one days

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:51.300
Um, so there's a patch now out there for the security

02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:55.460
So if you're not updating your systems for these security badges if it's just not on you

02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:57.220
Um

02:22:57.220 --> 02:23:00.740
My father-in-law has such an old iphone. You can't security patch it anymore

02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:07.300
so, you know and I tell him I said, you know, this is what you're missing out on this is what you're exposing yourself to because

02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:09.460
um, you know

02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:16.100
We talked about that powerful tool that uh, the how we found ross albrook at gmail.com. Well bad guys are using that too

02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:21.940
It's called, you know, it used to be called google dorking now. It's I think it's named kind of google hacking by the community

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:26.980
Um, you can go in, you know and find a vulnerability read about the white paper

02:23:26.980 --> 02:23:30.500
What's wrong with that that software and then you can go on the internet and find

02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:35.140
All of the computers that are running that outdated software and there's your list. There's your target list

02:23:35.620 --> 02:23:39.860
Yeah, I know the vulnerabilities that are running again not making a playbook here, but

02:23:40.660 --> 02:23:45.060
You know, that's how easy it is to to find your targets and that's what that's what the the bad guys are doing

02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:48.980
Then the reverse is tough. It's much tougher, but still doable

02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:52.740
Which is like first find the target if you have specific targets

02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:59.780
Uh to to you know hack into a twitter account, for example much harder. That's probably social engineering, right?

02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:02.820
That's probably the best way probably if you if you wanted something specific to that

02:24:02.900 --> 02:24:04.980
I mean if you really want to go far, you know

02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:08.820
If you're targeting a specific person, you know

02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:12.260
How hard is it to get into their office and put a you know?

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:18.020
A little device usb device in line with their mouse who checks how their mouse is plugged in and you can for 40 bucks

02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:22.420
On the black market. You can buy a key logger that just usb then the mouse plugs right into it

02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:28.500
It looks like an extension on the mouse if you can even find it you can buy the the stuff with a mouse inside of it

02:24:29.140 --> 02:24:32.900
And just plug it into somebody's computer as there's a key logger that lives in there and calls home

02:24:33.300 --> 02:24:35.540
Sends everything you want. So I mean and it's cheap

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:38.100
Yeah in grad school

02:24:39.300 --> 02:24:42.900
I programmed it built a bunch of key loggers. It was fascinating a tracking mouse

02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:45.860
Just for what I was doing as part of the research

02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:48.260
I was doing

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:49.460
to

02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:50.500
uh

02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:53.300
To see if by the dynamics of how you type

02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:57.620
And how you move the mouse you can tell who the person is. Oh, wow, that's like

02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:04.980
It's called the active authentication or like it's basically biometrics. That's not using bio

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:12.020
To see how identifiable that is so it's fascinating to study that but it's also fascinating how damn easy it is to install

02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:14.500
Key loggers, so I think is

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:20.900
Naturally what happens is you realize how many vulnerabilities there are in this world you do that when you

02:25:21.700 --> 02:25:28.020
Understand bacteria and viruses you realize they're everywhere in the same way with um, i'm talking about biological ones and then

02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:32.660
You realize that all the vulnerabilities that are out there. One of the things i've noticed quite a lot is

02:25:33.620 --> 02:25:35.780
How many people don't log out of their computers?

02:25:37.140 --> 02:25:40.420
Just how easy physical access the systems actually is

02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:46.580
Uh, like in a lot of places in this world and i'm not talking about private homes

02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:48.660
I'm talking about companies, especially large companies

02:25:49.220 --> 02:25:54.500
It seems quite trivial in certain places that i've been to to walk in and have physical access to a system

02:25:54.820 --> 02:26:01.300
And that's depressing to me. It is it just I laugh because uh, one of my my partners at naxo that I work at now

02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:06.340
Um, he he worked at a big company like you would know the name as soon as I told you i'm not gonna say it

02:26:06.900 --> 02:26:09.860
But the guy who owned the company and the company has his name on it

02:26:10.820 --> 02:26:12.340
Didn't want to

02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.660
Ever log into a computer just annoyed the shit out of him

02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:19.620
So they hired a person that stands next to his computer when he's not there and that's his physical security

02:26:20.980 --> 02:26:22.980
That's good, that's that's pretty good

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:25.060
Yeah, I mean I guess if you can afford to do that

02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:30.980
At least you're taking your security seriously. I feel like there's a lot of people in that case would just not have a login. Yeah

02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:35.860
No, the security team there had to really work around to make that work

02:26:36.900 --> 02:26:38.900
Non-compliant with company policy

02:26:39.220 --> 02:26:43.140
But that's that's interesting the the key log is there's there's a lot of

02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:45.620
There's just a lot of threats

02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:47.140
Yeah, I mean a lot of ways to get in

02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:47.380
Yeah

02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:52.980
I mean so you can't sit around and worry about someone like physically gaining access to your computer with keylogger and stuff like that

02:26:53.380 --> 02:26:58.980
Um, you know if you're traveling to a foreign country and you work for the fbi then yeah you do you pick little you know

02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:04.900
Sometimes some countries you would bring a fake laptop just to see if they stole it or accessed it. I really want

02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:09.940
Especially in this modern day to just create a lot of clones of myself that generate

02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:17.220
Lex sounding things and just get put so much information out there actually docks myself

02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:22.340
All across the world and then you're not a target. I guess just put it out there

02:27:22.580 --> 02:27:27.300
I've always said that though like we do these searches in fbi houses and stuff like that if someone just got like

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:31.860
A box load of like 10 terabyte drives and just encrypted them

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:36.900
Oh my god, you know how long the fbi would spin their wheels trying to get that data off there be insane

02:27:37.700 --> 02:27:39.700
Also, so just give them

02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:42.340
You don't even know which one you're looking for. Yeah

02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:47.860
That's true. That's true. So it's like me printing like a treasure map

02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:52.500
To a random location just get people to go on goose chase's

02:27:53.940 --> 02:27:58.340
Yeah, uh what what about operating system? What what have you found?

02:27:58.420 --> 02:28:02.740
And uh, what's the most secure and what's the least secure operating system windows linux?

02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:07.140
Is there no universal there's no universal security

02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:11.700
I mean it changed you people just think max were the most secure just because they just weren't out there

02:28:11.700 --> 02:28:14.020
But now kids have had access to them. So

02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:18.900
You know, it is, you know, I know you're a lennox guy. I like lennox too, but you know

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:21.860
It's tough to have run a business

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:26.900
On lennox, you know people want to move more towards the microsoft and the and the googles just because they don't

02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:30.660
It's easier to communicate with other people that maybe aren't computer guys. So

02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:36.340
You have to just take what what's best what's easiest and then secure the shit out of it as much as you can and just think

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:41.060
About it. What are you doing these days in nexo? So we just started nexo is uh, so I

02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:46.580
Left the government and uh went to a couple consultancies and I started working

02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:50.740
Really all the people I I I worked good in the government with

02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:56.820
Um, I brought them out with me. Um, and now you used to work for the man and now you're the man exactly

02:28:56.980 --> 02:29:02.420
So but now we formed a partnership and it's it's just a it's a new cyber security firm that we our launch party is actually

02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.500
On thursday, so it's going to be exciting

02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:08.180
Do you want to give more details about the party so that somebody can hack into it? No

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:10.260
I don't even tell you where it is

02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:14.900
You can come if you want but don't don't bring the hackers. Well, that's hector will be there

02:29:15.140 --> 02:29:21.060
I can't believe you invited me because you also say insider threat is is the is the biggest threat

02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:26.980
By the way, can you explain what the insider threat is the biggest insider threat in my life is my children

02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:33.220
Um, my my son's big into minecraft and will download executables mindlessly and just run them on the network

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:39.780
So he is you recommend against marriage and family and kids. Nope. Nope. I secure from a security perspective from a security perspective

02:29:39.860 --> 02:29:44.980
Absolutely, but uh, no I just uh segmentation. Uh, I mean we do it in all businesses for years

02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:50.660
Um started segmenting networks different networks. I just do it at home my kids on his own network

02:29:51.220 --> 02:29:52.260
um

02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:55.060
It makes it a little bit easier to see what they're doing too

02:29:55.140 --> 02:29:58.100
You can monitor traffic and then also throttle bandwidth

02:29:58.260 --> 02:30:01.620
If uh, if you know your netflix isn't playing fast enough or buffers or something

02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:05.780
So you can obviously change that a little too. You know, they're gonna listen to this, right?

02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:09.540
You're gonna get your tricks. Yeah, that's true. They'll definitely will listen

02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:11.540
But there's nothing more humbling than your family

02:30:11.540 --> 02:30:17.060
You think you've done something big and you go on a big podcast and talk to less freedom and they don't they don't give care

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:18.740
Yeah

02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:24.500
Unless unless you're on tiktok or yeah, you'll show up on a youtube feed or something like that and they'll be like, oh, yeah

02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:26.500
This guy's boring

02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:32.340
My son does a podcast for his school and um, it's still I still can't get it to tell like so

02:30:32.500 --> 02:30:36.340
So one of the hector and I just started a podcast talking about cyber security

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:41.860
We we do a podcast called hacker in the fed. It just came out yesterday. So uh the first episode nice

02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:47.540
So, yeah, we got 13 the 13 that 1300 downloads the first day so pretty we were at the top of hacker news

02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:51.940
Which is a big website in our world. So it's called hacker in the fed hacker in the fed's name

02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:54.660
It's so go download and listen to hacker in the fed

02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:58.340
I I can't wait to see what because I don't think i've seen a video of youtube together

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:01.540
So I can't wait to see what the the chemistry is like

02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:07.300
We're I mean, it's not weird that you guys used to be enemies and now you're friends

02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:12.420
So, yeah, I mean we just did some a trailer and all that and uh, the our producer

02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:16.500
We have a great producer guy named finneas and he kind of pulls things out of me and I said I said, okay

02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.580
I got one

02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:23.860
My relationship with hector is you know, we're very close friends now and and I was like, oh

02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:29.700
I arrested one of my closest friends. Yeah, which is a very strange relationship. Yeah, it's weird

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.660
You know, but he he says that I changed his life

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:36.340
I mean he was going down a very dark path and I gave him an option that one night and he

02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:41.060
He made the right choice. I mean he's he now does penetration testing. He does a lot of good work

02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:43.140
And uh, you know, he's turned his life around

02:31:44.420 --> 02:31:46.420
Do you worry about

02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:49.620
Cyber war in the 21st century? Absolutely. Yeah

02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:54.660
If there is a global war, it'll start with cyber, you know, if it's not already started

02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:57.620
do you feel like

02:31:57.620 --> 02:31:59.380
there's a

02:31:59.380 --> 02:32:01.060
like a boiling

02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:03.380
Like the the drums of war are beating

02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:10.260
What's happening in ukraine with russia it feels like the united states becoming more and more involved

02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:15.140
In the conflict in that part of the world and china is watching very closely

02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:17.860
It's starting to get involved

02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:19.460
geopolitically

02:32:19.460 --> 02:32:21.780
And probably in terms of cyber

02:32:22.420 --> 02:32:24.420
um, do you worry about

02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:31.140
This kind of thing happening in the next decade or two like where it really escalates, you know people in the in the 1920s

02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:36.660
Were completely terrible at predicting the world war two

02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:44.900
Do you think we're at the precipice of war potentially? I think we could be I I mean, I I would hate to just be

02:32:45.860 --> 02:32:49.540
You know just fear-mongering out there. Um, you know covid's over

02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:51.860
So the next big thing in the media is war and all that but

02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:54.500
I mean there's some some

02:32:55.060 --> 02:33:00.980
Flags going up that are very strange to me. Is there ways to avoid this? I hope so

02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:06.500
I hope smarter people than I are figuring it out. I hope people are playing their parts and in talking to the right people

02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:13.060
Um, because that's the war is the last thing I want. Well, there's two things to be concerned about on the cyber side

02:33:13.300 --> 02:33:15.300
One is the actual defense

02:33:15.940 --> 02:33:18.980
On the technical side of cyber and the other one is the panic

02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:21.620
that might happen when

02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:28.180
Something like some dramatic event happened because of cyber some major hack that becomes public

02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:31.220
I'm honestly more concerned about the panic

02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:33.300
because

02:33:33.300 --> 02:33:36.580
I feel like if people don't think about this stuff the panic can hit harder

02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:41.380
Like if if they if they're not conscious about the fact that we're constantly under attack

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:44.580
I feel like it'll come like a much harder surprise

02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:47.780
Yeah, I think people will be

02:33:47.780 --> 02:33:53.220
Really shocked on things. I mean, so we talked about lolsec today and lolsec was 2011. They had

02:33:54.100 --> 02:33:57.940
Access into a water the water supply system of a major us city

02:33:58.420 --> 02:33:59.540
They didn't do anything with it

02:33:59.540 --> 02:34:05.140
They were sitting on it in case someone got arrested and they were going to maybe just expose that it's insecure

02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.260
Maybe they were going to do something to fuck with it. I don't know but

02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:14.020
You know that that's that's 2011, you know, I don't think it's gotten a lot better since then

02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:19.880
And there's probably nation states or major organizations

02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:28.120
That are sitting secretly on hacks like a hundred percent a hundred percent they're sitting seriously waiting to expose things

02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:34.520
I mean I again, I don't want to scare the shit out of people but people have to understand the cyber threat

02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:36.600
I mean there are you know, they're

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:43.560
There are thousands of nation state hackers in some countries. I mean we have them too. We have offensive hackers

02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:45.720
You know the the terrorist attacks of 9-eleven

02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:53.500
There's planes that actually hit actual buildings and it was visibly clear and you can trace the information

02:34:54.280 --> 02:35:00.360
With cyber attacks say that something that would result in the in a major explosion in New York City

02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.400
How the hell do you trace that?

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:09.240
like if it's well done, it's going to be extremely difficult the problem is

02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:13.160
It there's so many problems one of which the u.s

02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:17.480
Government in that case has complete freedom to blame anybody they want true

02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:21.400
And then to to go start war with anybody

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:27.560
Anybody that actually see uh, do you all right? That's sorry. That's

02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:30.280
One cynical take on it, of course

02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:31.720
No, but you're going down the right path

02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:34.360
I mean the guys that the food planes in the buildings wanted attribution

02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:39.080
They took credit for it when we see the cyber attack. I doubt we're going to see attribution

02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:44.120
Maybe the victim side the u.s government on this side might come out and try to blame somebody

02:35:44.520 --> 02:35:49.880
But you know like you've brought up like they could blame anybody they want. There's not really a good way of verifying that

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:56.200
Can I just ask for your advice? So in my personal case am I being tracked?

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:58.920
How do I know?

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:00.920
How do I protect myself should I care?

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:07.800
You are being tracked. Um, I wouldn't say you're being tracked by the government. You're you're definitely being tracked by big tech

02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:13.560
uh, no, I mean me personally lex and an escalated level so like uh,

02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:16.600
um

02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:21.480
Like you mentioned there's an fbi file on people sure i'd love to see what's in that file

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280
uh

02:36:25.480 --> 02:36:32.440
Who did I have the argument for oh, let me ask you fbi. Yeah, um, how's the cafeteria food in fbi at the academy?

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:34.440
It's bad. Yeah

02:36:34.440 --> 02:36:38.920
Um, what about like at headquarters headquarters a little bit better because that's what the director

02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.200
I mean, he eats up on the seventh floor. Have you been like a google?

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:47.480
Have you been in the silicon valley those cafeteria like those i've been to the google in silicon valley

02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:52.680
I've been to the google in new york. Yeah, the food is incredible. It is great. So fbi is worse

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.480
Well when you're going through the academy, they don't let you outside of the building. So you have to eat it

02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.880
Um, and I think that's the only reason people eat it

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:02.680
Um, it's it's pretty bad

02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:04.680
I got it

02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:09.000
Okay, but but there's also a bar inside the fbi academy people don't know that

02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:11.480
Alcohol bar. Yes alcohol bar

02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:17.720
And if you as long as you've passed your pt and uh in in going well, you're allowed to go to the bar

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:19.240
nice

02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:21.240
It feels like if I was a hacker

02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:26.600
I'll be going after like celebrities because they're a little bit easier like celebrity celebrities like hollywood

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:29.960
The hollywood nudes were a big thing there for a long time

02:37:30.520 --> 02:37:34.600
But now yeah, I guess news that's what they went after. I mean all those guys they socialize

02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:37.320
They did they they social engineered apple to get

02:37:37.940 --> 02:37:41.320
Backups to get the recoveries for backups and then they just pulled all their news

02:37:41.320 --> 02:37:43.480
And I mean whole websites were dedicated to that

02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:50.280
Yeah, see that see I wouldn't do that kind of stuff. It's very creepy. I would go if I was a hacker. I would go after

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:54.200
Like

02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.280
Major like powerful people

02:37:56.360 --> 02:38:01.880
And like tweet something from their account and like something that like positive like loving

02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.320
But like for the for the walls the obvious that it's a troll god you get busted so quick

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:09.960
By what a bad hacker

02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:13.480
Really? But why because hackers never put things out about love?

02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:15.080
Okay

02:38:15.080 --> 02:38:20.760
Oh, you mean like this is clearly this is clearly lex what the fuck about love in every podcast he does

02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:24.520
I would just be like no. Oh god. Damn it. Now somebody's gonna do it

02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400
You'll blame me it wasn't me

02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:30.360
Looking back at your life. Is there something you

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:35.400
I'm only 44 years old. I'm already looking back. Is there stuff that

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:37.800
um

02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:39.480
You regret

02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:41.000
Evie unit

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Yeah, I got away

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.680
So is the one that got away

02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:49.880
uh, yeah, I mean it took me a while into my law enforcement career to learn about like the compassionate side and

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:56.520
And it took hector monster here to make me realize that criminals aren't really criminals they're human beings

02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:01.640
Um that really humanized the whole thing for me sitting with him for for nine months

02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.520
Um, I think that's maybe why I had a lot more compassion when I arrested ross

02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:10.440
Probably wouldn't have been so compassionate if it was before hector

02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:14.840
But but yeah, he changed my life and showed me that that that humanity side of things

02:39:15.160 --> 02:39:17.160
so would it be fair to say that all

02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:20.120
All the criminals or most criminals are

02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:22.120
just

02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:27.640
People that took a wrong turn at some point they they all have the capacity for for good and for evil in them

02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:35.660
Uh, i'd say 99 of the people the criminals that i've interacted with yes, uh the people with the child exploitation

02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:38.040
No, I don't have any place in my heart for them

02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.400
What advice would you give to?

02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.040
To people in college people in high school trying to figure out what they want to do with their life

02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:50.200
How to have a life they can be proud of how to have a career they can be proud of

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:57.980
All that kind of stuff in the u.s. Um budget that was just put forward. There's 18 billion dollars for cyber security

02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:02.280
We're about a million people short of where we really should be in the industry if not more

02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:07.160
If you have want job security and want to work and then see exciting stuff

02:40:07.960 --> 02:40:11.080
Head towards cyber security. It's a it's it's a good career

02:40:11.640 --> 02:40:13.240
um, and

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:17.400
You know one thing I dislike about like, uh cyber security right now

02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:22.440
Is they expect you to come out of college and have 10 years experience in protecting and knowing every different

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:26.280
Python script out there and everything available. Um, you know

02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:32.680
The industry needs to change and let the lower people in in order to to to broaden and get those billion jobs filled

02:40:33.080 --> 02:40:35.080
Um, but as far as their personal security

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:38.600
Just remember it's all going to follow you. I mean, uh, you know

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.080
There's laws out there now there you have to turn over your social media accounts in order to have certain things

02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:46.440
Um, they just changed that in new york state if you want to carry a gun

02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.280
You have to turn over your social media to to figure if you're a good social

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:52.360
uh character

02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:54.120
um, so

02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:58.600
Hopefully you didn't say something strange in the last few years and it's going to follow you forever

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:04.440
Um, I I bet ross albrook would tell you the same thing when you not don't put ross albrook at gmail.com on things

02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:06.200
Because it's going to last forever

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:11.560
Yeah people sometimes for some for some reason they interact on social media is if they're talking to a couple of buddies

02:41:12.840 --> 02:41:14.680
uh, like

02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.520
just shooting shit and mocking and and like, um

02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:23.320
You know, what is that busting each other's chops like making fun of yourself like being

02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:27.560
Uh, especially gaming culture, uh, like people who stream

02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:31.720
Thank god that's not recorded. Oh my god the things people say on those streams

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:38.520
Yeah, but a lot of them are recorded yeah, this is so there's there's a whole twitch thing where people stream for many hours a day

02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:41.160
and uh

02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:43.000
I mean just

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.880
outside of the very offensive things they say

02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:50.600
They just swear a lot. They're not the kind of person

02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:56.520
That I would want to hire. Yeah, I want to want to work with now. I understand

02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:04.440
That some of us might be that way privately I guess when you're shooting shit with friends like, uh

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Playing a video game and talking shit to each other

02:42:07.160 --> 02:42:12.040
Maybe yeah, but like that's all out there. You have to be conscious of the fact that that's all out there

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:14.440
And it's just not it's not a good look

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.920
It's not like you're you should it's it's complicated because i'm like against hiding who you

02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:21.000
are

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
But like an asshole you should hide some of it

02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:29.800
Yeah, but like I just feel like it's going to be misinterpreted when you talk shit to your friends while you're playing video games

02:42:30.680 --> 02:42:33.800
It doesn't mean you're an asshole because you're an asshole to your friend

02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:39.960
But that's how uh a lot of friends show love. Yeah an outside person can't judge how i'm friends with you

02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:45.400
If I want to be this is our relationship if that person can say that i'm an asshole to them

02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:50.360
Uh, then that's fine. I'll take it but you can't tell me i'm an asshole to them just because you saw my interaction

02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:55.000
I agree with that. They'll take those words out of context and now that's that's considered

02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.120
Who you are is dangerous and people take that very nonchalantly people treat their

02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.280
Behavior on the internet very very carelessly. That's definitely something

02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:09.480
You need to learn and take extremely seriously. Also, I think like taking that seriously

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:15.000
Will help you figure out who you what you really stand for if you use your language

02:43:16.180 --> 02:43:17.640
Carelessly

02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:24.360
You'd never really ask like what do I stand for I feel like it's a good opportunity when you're young to ask like

02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:27.080
What are the things that are?

02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:28.760
Okay to say

02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:31.560
What are the things what are the ideas I stand behind?

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:34.620
Like what especially if they're controversial

02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:40.520
And i'm willing to say them because I believe in them versus just saying random shit for the for the lulz

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.880
Because for the random shit for the lulz keep that from off the internet

02:43:44.520 --> 02:43:47.320
That said man, I was an idiot for most of my life

02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:53.080
And i'm constantly learning and growing it. I'd hate to be responsible for the kind of person

02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:56.600
Uh, I was in my teens

02:43:57.080 --> 02:44:00.840
Oh in my in my 20s. I didn't do anything offensive, but it just

02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:06.360
Changed as a person like I used to I guess I probably still do but I used to you know

02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:08.440
I used to read so much existential literature

02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:11.800
Uh, that was that was a phase there's like phases

02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:15.320
Yeah, you grow and evolve as a person that changes you in the future

02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:18.920
Yeah, I thank god there wasn't social media when I was in high school. Thank god

02:44:19.880 --> 02:44:21.880
Oh my god, I would never have gotten the fbi

02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:26.520
Would you recommend that people consider a career? Uh at a place like the fbi?

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:31.320
I loved the fbi. I never thought I would go any place else

02:44:31.320 --> 02:44:35.640
But the fbi I thought I was going to retire with the the gold watch and everything from the fbi

02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:39.480
That was my plan. No, but you know what? It's uh, oh it's an expression

02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:42.840
Um, you get a gold badge

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:46.840
You actually get your badge in lucite and your creds put it in lucite and all that so

02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:50.600
Does it does it by the way just on a tangent since we like those?

02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:53.880
Does it hurt you that the fbi?

02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:57.560
By certain people is distrusted or even hated

02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:01.000
100 it kills me. I like I've never

02:45:01.720 --> 02:45:03.720
until recently not I

02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:06.200
Sometimes be embarrassed

02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:07.480
about

02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:12.040
The fbi sometimes which is really really hard for me to say because I love that place

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:13.320
I love the people in it

02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:19.000
I love the the the brotherhood that you have with you know, all the guys in your squad the guys and girls

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.240
I just use guys, you know, we you know, we

02:45:22.120 --> 02:45:25.320
I I developed a real drinking problem there because we were so social

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:30.520
Of going out after after work and and you know continuing on it really was a family

02:45:31.160 --> 02:45:34.680
Um, you know, so I do miss that um

02:45:35.720 --> 02:45:40.200
But yeah, I mean if someone can become an fbi agent, I mean, it's pretty fucking cool, man

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:44.600
The day you graduate and walk out of the academy with a gun and a badge and you know

02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:49.400
The the power to charge someone with a misdemeanor for flying a united states flag at night

02:45:50.120 --> 02:45:52.120
That's awesome

02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:57.240
So so there is a part of like representing and loving your country and especially if you're doing cyber security

02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:03.400
So there's a lot of technical savvy in the in different places in the fbi. Yeah, I mean there there's different

02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:07.640
Pieces sometimes, you know, you'll see an older agent that's done, you know

02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:11.560
Not cyber crime come over to cyber crime at the end so he can get a job once he goes out

02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:14.120
But there's also some some guys that come in

02:46:14.520 --> 02:46:16.600
Um, you know, I won't name his name, but there was a guy

02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:19.880
I mean, I think he was a hacker when he was a kid and now he's been an agent now

02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:24.600
He's way up in management. Um, great guy. I love this guy and he knows who he is if he's listening

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:28.920
Um, you know that that you know, he had some skills

02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:32.120
but we also lost a bunch of guys that had some skills because because

02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:34.440
Uh, we had one guy in the squad

02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:38.760
That he had to leave the fbi because his wife became a doctor and she got a residency down in

02:46:39.160 --> 02:46:44.600
Houston and and she couldn't move he he wasn't allowed to transfer so he decided to keep his family versus

02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:52.360
The fbi so there's some stringent rules in the fbi that that need to be relaxed a little bit. Yeah, I love hackers turned

02:46:53.080 --> 02:46:55.080
Like leaders like one of my

02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:57.720
Quickly becoming good friends as much

02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:02.200
He was a big hacker in the 90s and then uh now was recently

02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:04.760
twitter

02:47:04.760 --> 02:47:05.800
chief

02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:07.800
security officer csl

02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:11.000
uh, but he had a bunch of different leadership positions including being my

02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:14.280
boss at google, but um

02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:19.240
But originally a hacker it's cool to see like hackers become like leaders

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:22.040
I just wonder what's what would cause him to stop doing it

02:47:22.600 --> 02:47:27.000
Why he would then take like a like a managerial route very high tech companies

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:32.120
I think a lot of those guys so this is like the 90s. They really were about like the freedom

02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:35.240
Uh, there's like a philosophy to it

02:47:35.560 --> 02:47:39.080
And when I think the hacking culture evolved over the years

02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:43.240
And I think when it leaves you behind you start to realize like oh

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:46.520
Actually, what I want to do is I want to help the world and I can do that in

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.560
Legitimate routes and so on but that's the story that and yeah, I would love to

02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:54.440
Talk to him one day, but I

02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:59.160
I wonder how common that is too like young hackers turn turn good

02:47:59.400 --> 02:48:03.480
You're saying it like pulls you in it's if you're not careful can really pull you in. Yeah

02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:07.800
You know, you're good at it. You become powerful you become you know

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.120
Everyone's slapping you on the back and say what a good job and all that, you know at a very young age

02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:16.760
Yeah, so yeah, I would love to get into my buddy's mind on why he stopped hacking

02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:19.640
And moved on. Oh, that's gonna be a good conversation

02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:27.240
In his case, maybe it's always about a great woman involved a family and so on. Yeah, that grounds you

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:32.200
Because like we have

02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:38.840
There is a danger to hacking that once you're in a relationship once you have family, maybe you're not willing to partake in

02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:41.800
What's your story what uh

02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:46.680
From childhood, what are some fond memories you have fond memories? Where did you grow up?

02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:49.240
Well, I don't give away that information

02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:52.840
In the United States. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah in Virginia

02:48:54.040 --> 02:48:58.280
What are some rough moments? What are some beautiful moments that you remember? I

02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:01.720
Had a very good family growing up

02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:08.280
The the like rough moment and I'll tell you a story that just happened to me two days ago and it fucked me up

02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:12.120
Man, it really didn't you'll be the first one. I've never told I tried to tell my wife this two nights ago

02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:13.640
And I couldn't get it out

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:14.760
so

02:49:14.760 --> 02:49:16.360
my father

02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:20.200
Uh, he's a disabled veteran or he was a disabled veteran

02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:23.720
He was in the army and got hurt and uh, it was in a wheelchair his whole life. Um

02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:26.040
All my growing up

02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.800
he uh

02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:33.640
He was my biggest fan. He just wanted to know everything about you know, what's going on in the FBI my stories

02:49:34.040 --> 02:49:38.280
Um, I was a local cop before the FBI and I got to a high-speed car chase, uh, you know

02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:43.880
foot chase and all that and kicking doors in he he wanted to hear none of those stories and

02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:47.240
At some points I was kind of too cool for school and ah dad

02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:49.880
I just want to break and all that and and things going on

02:49:51.160 --> 02:49:53.160
We we lost my dad during covid

02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:55.640
Um, not because of covid but it was around that time

02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:01.560
But but it was right when covid was kicking off and so he died in the hospital by himself and I didn't get to see him then

02:50:02.200 --> 02:50:04.200
um, and then uh

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:10.760
My mom had some people visiting her the other night and uh, the tom and karen rogerberg and i'll say they're my second biggest fans

02:50:10.840 --> 02:50:12.040
Right behind my dad

02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:17.640
Um, they they they always asking about me and my career and they read the books and seen the movie

02:50:17.880 --> 02:50:19.880
They'll even tell you that silk road movie was good

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:25.080
Little idea on that but and so they came over and uh

02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:29.880
And I helped them with something and uh, my mom was that called me back a couple days later

02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:31.640
And she said I appreciate you helping them. I you know

02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:36.360
I know you know fixing someone's apple phone over the phone really isn't what you do for a living

02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:39.400
It's not it's kind of beneath you and all that and uh, but but I appreciate it

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:46.280
And she said oh they they loved hearing the stories about you know, silk road and all those things and she goes, you know

02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:50.680
Your dad he loved those stories. He just he I just wish he could have heard him

02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:55.800
I mean he even would tell me he would say, uh, you know, maybe maybe chris will come home and uh,

02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:58.040
I'll get him drunk and he'll tell me the stories

02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:00.600
Um, but and then she goes

02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:04.920
Maybe one day and in heaven you can tell him those stories and I fucking lost it

02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:10.200
I literally stood in my shower sobbing. Yeah, like like a child

02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:16.040
Like it just thinking about like all my dad wanted was those those stories. Yeah

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:22.280
And now i'm on a fucking podcast telling stories to the world and uh, I didn't tell him. Yeah, so

02:51:23.640 --> 02:51:27.240
Did you ever have like a long heart to heart with him about like

02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:29.560
about

02:51:29.560 --> 02:51:33.240
Such stories he was in the hospital one time and I went through and uh,

02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:39.320
I want to know about his history like his life what he did and I think he maybe sensationalized some of it

02:51:39.800 --> 02:51:44.200
Um, but that's what you want. Your dad's a hero. So you want to hear those things. He's a good storyteller. Um,

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.560
Yeah, again, I don't know what was true and not true, but you know

02:51:48.520 --> 02:51:52.440
Some of it was really good. Um, and it was just good to hear his life

02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:56.600
But you know, we lost him and and and now those stories are gone

02:51:57.480 --> 02:51:59.480
You miss him? Yeah

02:52:01.640 --> 02:52:04.840
What did he teach you about what it means to be a man

02:52:08.600 --> 02:52:10.600
So my dad, um

02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:14.280
He was an engineer and so

02:52:15.080 --> 02:52:17.720
part of his job we worked for um vermont

02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:20.680
power and electric or whatever it was

02:52:21.080 --> 02:52:24.360
I mean he when he first got married to my mom and all that. Um

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:28.920
Like he flew around in a helicopter checking out like power lines and dams

02:52:29.160 --> 02:52:35.480
He used to swim inside to scuba into dams to check to make sure like they were functioning properly and all that pretty cool shit

02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:39.320
And then he couldn't walk anymore

02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:46.440
I probably would have killed myself if my life switched like that so bad and my dad probably went through some dark points

02:52:46.440 --> 02:52:48.280
But he had that from me maybe

02:52:48.600 --> 02:52:54.680
And so to get through that struggle to teach me like, you know, you you press on you have a family people count on you

02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:57.080
You do what you got to do?

02:52:57.720 --> 02:52:59.720
That was that was big

02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:01.320
Yeah

02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:04.600
I'm sure you make him proud man. I i'm sure I do but

02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:07.560
I don't think he knew that that I knew that

02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:12.040
Well, you get to pass on that love to your kids now

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:17.080
I try I try but I can't impress him as much as uh, my dad impressed me

02:53:18.440 --> 02:53:20.440
I can try all I want but

02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:22.920
Well, what do you think is the role of love?

02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:25.880
because you uh

02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:29.880
You you gave me some grief you busted my balls a little bit for talking about love a lot

02:53:29.880 --> 02:53:31.880
What do you think is the role of love in the human condition?

02:53:31.960 --> 02:53:33.320
I think it's the greatest thing

02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:37.080
I think everyone should be searching for it if you don't have it find it get it as soon as you can

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:40.360
Um, I love my wife. I really do

02:53:41.080 --> 02:53:43.960
I had no idea what love was until my kids were born

02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:46.600
my son came out and um

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.240
This is a funny story he came out and uh, you know

02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:53.160
I just wanted to be safe and be healthy and all that and I said to the doctor I said

02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:58.280
Ten and ten doc, you know, ten fingers ten toes everything good and he goes nine and nine

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:03.160
I was like, what the fuck? He's like, oh, this is gonna suck. Okay, we'll deal with it and all that

02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:09.400
Uh, he was talking about the apno card chord or some score about breathing and color and all that and I I was like

02:54:09.400 --> 02:54:11.400
Oh shit, but I had no one told me this

02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:17.240
Um, but so i'm just sobbing I couldn't even cut the umbilical cord like just fell in love with my kids when I saw

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:20.840
them and and that to me really is what what love is like just

02:54:21.400 --> 02:54:26.280
For them man, and and I see that through your career that love developed, which is awesome the

02:54:27.320 --> 02:54:30.680
the the the being able to see the humanity in people

02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:37.640
I didn't when I was young the the the foolishness of youth. Yeah, you know, I I needed to learn that lesson hard

02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:39.960
I mean, you know when I was young in my career

02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:43.720
It was just about career goals and you know and resting people became stats

02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:46.360
You know you rest someone you get a good stat you get an atta boy

02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:50.600
You know, maybe you know the boss likes it and you get a better job or you get you move up the chain

02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:55.720
It took it took a real change in my life to see that humanity

02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:00.120
And uh, I can't wait to listen to to your talk. It's just

02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:03.400
