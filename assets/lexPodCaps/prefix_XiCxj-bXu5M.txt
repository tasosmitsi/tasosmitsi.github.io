00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company that endures

00:05.440 --> 00:10.400
a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things. You have no choice.

00:10.400 --> 00:16.240
And I often felt I had to sacrifice things for the long term. And whether that would have been,

00:16.240 --> 00:20.080
you know, really difficult things like, you know, job changes or reductions,

00:20.640 --> 00:24.640
or whether it would be things like, hey, you know, we're going to change the way we do our

00:24.640 --> 00:30.880
semiconductors and a whole different philosophy, you have no choice. I mean,

00:30.880 --> 00:35.120
and in times of crisis as well, you got to be, I always said it's not a popularity contest.

00:37.440 --> 00:42.240
The following is a conversation with Jeannie Vermette, who was a longtime CEO, president,

00:42.240 --> 00:47.600
and chairman of IBM. And for many years, she was widely considered to be one of the most powerful

00:47.600 --> 00:54.400
women in the world. She's the author of a new book on power, leadership, and her life story

00:54.400 --> 01:02.400
called Good Power, coming out on March 7th. She is an incredible leader and human being,

01:02.400 --> 01:07.840
both fearless and compassionate. It was a huge honor and pleasure for me to sit down and have

01:07.840 --> 01:13.040
this chat with her. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our

01:13.040 --> 01:18.160
sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Jeannie Vermette.

01:19.120 --> 01:24.800
You worked at IBM for over 40 years, starting as a systems engineer, and you ran the company

01:24.800 --> 01:31.840
as chairman, president, and CEO from 2011 to 2020. IBM is one of the largest tech companies in the

01:31.840 --> 01:39.680
world with, maybe you can correct me on this, with about 280,000 employees. What are the biggest

01:39.680 --> 01:45.200
challenges running the company of that size? Let's start with a big overview question.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.640
The biggest challenges I think are not in running them, it's in changing them.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.920
And that idea to know what you should change and what you should not change. Actually,

01:53.920 --> 01:58.400
people don't always ask that question. What should endure, even if it has to be modernized,

01:58.400 --> 02:03.280
but what should endure? And then I found the hardest part was changing how work got done

02:03.280 --> 02:09.520
at such a big company. What was the part that you thought should endure? The core of the company

02:09.520 --> 02:13.520
that was beautiful and powerful and could persist through time, that should persist through time.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.080
I'd be interested, do you have a perception of what you think it would be?

02:17.680 --> 02:23.520
Do I have a perception? Well, I'm a romantic for a history of long-running companies, so there's

02:23.520 --> 02:32.720
kind of a tradition as an AI person. To me, IBM has some epic sort of research accomplishments,

02:32.720 --> 02:40.080
where you show off, you know, Deep Blue and Watson, just impressive big moonshot challenges

02:40.080 --> 02:44.400
and accomplishing those. But that's, I think, that's probably a small part of what IBM is.

02:44.400 --> 02:52.320
That's mostly the sexy public-facing part. Well, certainly the research part itself

02:52.320 --> 02:57.280
is over 3,000, so it's not that small. That's a pretty big research group. But the part that

02:57.280 --> 03:03.040
should endure ends up being a company that does things that are essential to the world, meaning

03:03.520 --> 03:11.040
the who, you know, think back. You said you're a romantic. It was the 30s, the social security

03:11.040 --> 03:15.600
system. It was putting the man on the moon. It was, you know, to this day, banks don't run,

03:15.600 --> 03:22.000
you know, railroads don't run. That is at its core, it's doing mission-critical work.

03:22.560 --> 03:28.160
And so that part, I think, is at its core, it's a business-to-business company. And at its core,

03:28.240 --> 03:33.440
it's about doing things that are really important to the world, becoming running and being better.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.280
Running the infrastructure of the world, so doing it at scale, doing it reliably.

03:37.280 --> 03:42.240
Yes, secure in this world, that's like everything. In fact, when I started, I almost felt people

03:42.240 --> 03:47.120
were looking for what that was. And together, we sort of, in a word, it was to be essential.

03:47.120 --> 03:52.560
And the reason I love that word was, I can't call myself essential. You have to determine I am,

03:52.560 --> 03:56.880
right? So it was to be essential, even though some of what we did is exactly what you said,

03:56.880 --> 04:00.880
it's below the surface. So many people, because people say to me, well, what does IBM do now,

04:00.880 --> 04:07.200
right? And over the years, it's changed so much. And today, it's really a software and consulting

04:07.200 --> 04:13.680
company. Consulting is a third of it. And the software is all hybrid cloud and AI. That would

04:13.680 --> 04:18.640
not have been true, as you well know, back even two decades ago, right? So it changes. But I think

04:18.640 --> 04:23.600
at its core, it's that be essential. You said moonshot, can't all be moonshots because moonshots

04:23.600 --> 04:32.000
don't always work, but mission critical work. So given the size, though, when you started running

04:32.000 --> 04:38.160
it, did you feel the sort of thing that people usually associate with size, which is bureaucracy

04:39.280 --> 04:44.800
and maybe the aspect of size that hinder progress or hinder pivoting? Did you feel that?

04:44.800 --> 04:51.520
You would, for lots of reasons. I think when you're a big company, sometimes people think of

04:51.600 --> 04:57.840
processes, the client themselves. I always say to people, your process is not your customer.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.880
There is a real customer here that you exist for. And that's really easy to fall into,

05:02.880 --> 05:09.840
because people are a master to this process. And that's not right. And when you're big,

05:09.840 --> 05:16.240
the other thing and boy, there's a premium on it is speed, right? That in our industry,

05:16.880 --> 05:20.880
you got to be fast. And go back, like when I took over and it was 2012,

05:22.640 --> 05:26.560
we had a lot of catching up to do and a lot of things to do. And it was moving so fast.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.120
And as you well know, all those trends were happening at once, which made them go even faster.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.040
And so pretty unprecedented, actually, for that many trends to be at one time.

05:35.600 --> 05:42.880
And I used to say to people, go faster, go faster, go faster. And honestly, I've tired them out. I

05:42.880 --> 05:48.800
mean, it kind of dawned on me that when you're that big, it's a really valuable lesson. And it

05:48.800 --> 05:54.000
taught me like the hows, perhaps more important than the what. Because if I didn't do something

05:54.000 --> 05:58.880
to change how work was done, like change those processes or give them new tools, help them with

05:58.880 --> 06:04.640
skills, they couldn't. They just like do the same thing faster. If someone tells you, you know,

06:04.640 --> 06:08.320
you've got hiking boots and they're like, no, go run a marathon. You're like, I can't do it in

06:08.320 --> 06:14.880
those boots. But so you've got to do something. And at first, I think the ways for big companies,

06:14.880 --> 06:19.280
I would call them like blunt clubs, you do what everyone does, you reduce layers, because if you

06:19.280 --> 06:24.960
reduce layers, decisions go faster. There's just, it's math. If there's less decision points, things

06:24.960 --> 06:31.360
go faster. You do the blunt club thing. And then after that, though, it did lead me down a, you

06:31.360 --> 06:36.800
know, a long journey of they sound like buzzwords. But if you really do them at scale, they're hard

06:36.880 --> 06:42.720
around things like agile. And because you've really got to change the way work gets done.

06:42.720 --> 06:47.280
And we ended up training, God, hundreds of thousands of people on that stuff.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.120
On how to do agile correctly.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.800
On how to do it correctly. That's right. Versus, because everybody talks about it.

06:52.800 --> 06:58.320
But the idea that you would really have small multidisciplinary teams work from the outside in,

06:58.320 --> 07:04.320
set those sort of interim steps, you know, take the feedback pivot, and then do it on not just

07:04.320 --> 07:09.120
products, do it on lots of things, was, it's hard to do at scale. People always say, oh,

07:09.120 --> 07:13.840
I got this agile group over here of 40 people. But not when you're a couple hundred thousand people,

07:13.840 --> 07:15.920
you got to get a lot of people to work that way.

07:15.920 --> 07:19.760
The blunt club thing you're talking about. So flatten the organization as much as possible?

07:19.760 --> 07:23.360
Yeah, yeah, I probably reduced the layers of management by half. And so,

07:24.880 --> 07:30.640
that does, that has lots of benefits, right? Time to a decision, more autonomy to people,

07:30.880 --> 07:36.480
and then the idea of like, faster clarity of where you're going, because you're not just

07:36.480 --> 07:41.760
filtered through so many different layers. And I think it's the kind of thing a lot of companies,

07:41.760 --> 07:44.960
if you're big, have to just keep going through. It's kind of like grass grows, you know,

07:44.960 --> 07:49.840
it just comes back and you got to go back down and work on it. So it's a natural thing.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.920
But I hear so many people talk about it, Lex, this idea of like, okay, well, who makes a decision?

07:55.920 --> 08:00.160
You've often heard nobody can say yes and everybody can say no. And that's actually what

08:00.160 --> 08:07.120
you're trying to get out of a system like that. So, I mean, your book in general, the way you

08:07.120 --> 08:12.960
lead is very much about we and us, you know, the power of we. But is there times when a leader has

08:12.960 --> 08:18.640
to step in and be almost autocratic, take control and make hard unpopular decisions? Oh, I am sure

08:18.640 --> 08:24.400
you know the answer to that. And it is, of course, yes. It's fun to hear you say it. Yeah. You know,

08:24.960 --> 08:29.840
because I actually, A, there's a leader for a time, but then there's a leader for a situation,

08:29.840 --> 08:35.440
right? And so I've had to do plenty of unpopular things. I think anytime you have to run a company

08:35.440 --> 08:40.720
that endures a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things. You have

08:40.720 --> 08:46.880
no choice. And I often felt I had to sacrifice things for the long term. And whether that would

08:46.880 --> 08:52.720
have been, you know, really difficult things like, you know, job changes or reductions, or whether

08:52.720 --> 08:56.800
it would be things like, hey, you know, we're going to change the way we do our semiconductors

08:57.360 --> 09:03.360
and a whole different philosophy. You have no choice. I mean, and in times of crisis as well,

09:03.360 --> 09:09.200
you got to be, I always said it's not a popularity contest. So that's none of these jobs are

09:09.200 --> 09:13.920
popularity contests. I don't care if your company's got one person or half a million, they're not

09:13.920 --> 09:19.680
popularity contests. But psychologically, is it difficult to just sort of step in as a new CEO?

09:22.000 --> 09:25.680
Because you're fighting against tradition, against all these people that act like experts of their

09:25.680 --> 09:30.160
thing, and they are experts of their thing, to step in and say, we have to do differently.

09:30.160 --> 09:34.800
When you got to change a company, it's really tempting to say throw everything else out back

09:34.800 --> 09:39.760
to that what must endure, right? But I know when I took over to start, I knew how much had to change

09:39.760 --> 09:45.440
more I got into it, I could see, wow, a lot more had to change, right? Because we needed a platform,

09:45.440 --> 09:50.320
we'd always done our best when we had a platform, a technology platform, you will go back in time,

09:50.320 --> 09:55.520
and you'll think of the mainframe systems, you'll think of the PC, you'll think of perhaps middleware,

09:56.160 --> 10:02.320
you could even call services a platform, we needed a platform, the next platform here to be there.

10:03.120 --> 10:08.880
Skills, when I took over, we inventoried who had modern skills for the future, it was two out of

10:08.880 --> 10:12.160
10 people for the future, not that they didn't have relevant skills today, but for the future,

10:12.160 --> 10:17.440
two out of 10, yikes, that's a big problem, right? The speed at which things were getting done,

10:17.440 --> 10:24.400
that has to, so you got so much to do, and you say, is that a scary thing? Yes. Do you have to

10:24.400 --> 10:30.000
sometimes dictate yes, but I did find, and it is worth it, I know every big company I know,

10:30.000 --> 10:36.560
my good friend that runs General Motors, she's had to change, go back to what is them them,

10:36.560 --> 10:41.360
you know, and when you do that, that back to be essential, we kind of started with, hey,

10:41.360 --> 10:45.200
it's be essential, then the next thing I did with the team was say, okay, now this means

10:45.200 --> 10:50.480
new era of computing, new buyers are out there, and eh, we better have new skills, okay, now the

10:50.480 --> 10:57.280
next thing, how do you operationalize it? And it just takes some time, but you can engineer that

10:57.280 --> 11:03.440
and get people to build belief. And for the skills, that means hiring and that means training?

11:04.080 --> 11:09.760
Yes, oh boy, that's a long, skills is a really long topic in and of itself, I try to put my

11:09.760 --> 11:16.880
view in it, I learned a lot and I changed my view on this a lot. I'll go back at my very beginning,

11:16.880 --> 11:22.880
say 40 years ago, I would have said, at that point, okay, I was always in a hurry, I was

11:22.880 --> 11:26.880
interviewing to hire people, I don't know how you hire people, 40 years ago, I'd be like, okay,

11:26.880 --> 11:30.800
I got to fit in these interviews, I got to hire someone to get this done, okay, then time would

11:30.800 --> 11:34.960
go on, I'm like, that's not very good, in fact, someone once said to me, hey, hire the best people

11:34.960 --> 11:39.200
to work for you and your job gets a lot easier, okay, I should spend more time on this topic,

11:39.200 --> 11:44.880
spend more time on it, then it was like, okay, hire experts, okay, okay, hired a lot of experts

11:44.880 --> 11:50.800
over my life and then I was really like an epiphany and it really happened over my tenure

11:51.360 --> 11:56.000
running the company and having to change skills, if someone's an expert at something and has just

11:56.000 --> 12:02.240
done that for 30 years, the odds of them really wanting to change a lot are pretty low and when

12:02.240 --> 12:07.120
you're in a really dynamic industry, that's a problem and so, okay, that was like kind of my

12:07.120 --> 12:13.280
first revelation on this and then when I looked to hiring, I can remember when I started my job,

12:13.280 --> 12:18.080
we needed cyber people and I go out there and I look, unemployment in the U.S. was almost 10%,

12:18.800 --> 12:23.600
can't find them, okay, it's 10% and I can't find the people, okay, what's the issue, okay,

12:23.600 --> 12:29.920
they're not teaching the right things, that led me down a path and it was serendipity that I

12:29.920 --> 12:34.640
happened to do a review of corporate social responsibility, we had this one little fledgling

12:34.640 --> 12:40.320
school in a low-income area and high school with a community college, we gave them internships,

12:40.320 --> 12:47.520
direction on curriculum, behold, we could hire these kids, I said, hmm, this is not CSR, like,

12:47.520 --> 12:53.440
I just found a new talent pool, which takes me to now what I'm doing in my post-retirement,

12:53.440 --> 13:00.320
I'm like, this idea that don't hire just for a college degree, we had 99% of our hires were

13:00.320 --> 13:04.480
college and PhDs and I'm all for it, so you're very, don't, don't.

13:04.480 --> 13:05.520
I'm deeply offended.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.720
No, you should not be and I, you know, I'm vice chair at Northwestern,

13:09.680 --> 13:15.520
but I said, I just really like, aptitude does not equal access, these people didn't have access,

13:15.520 --> 13:22.080
but they had aptitude, it changed my whole view to skills first and so now for hiring,

13:22.080 --> 13:26.320
that's kind of a long story to tell you, the number one thing I would hire for now is somebody's

13:26.320 --> 13:30.800
willingness to learn, you know, and you can test, you can try different ways, but their curiosity

13:30.800 --> 13:35.440
and willingness to learn, hands down, I will take that trait over anything else they have.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.680
So the interview process, the questions you asked.

13:37.760 --> 13:38.560
Everything changed.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.280
The kind of things you talk to them about is try to get at how curious they are about the world.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.360
And you can do testing and I mean, there's, we triangulated around it lots of ways and now look,

13:47.360 --> 13:52.080
they're, at the heart of it, what it would do is change, you don't think of buying skills,

13:52.080 --> 13:57.760
you see, you think of building skills and when you think that way, with so many people and I think

13:58.560 --> 14:01.360
this country, many developed countries being disenfranchised,

14:02.080 --> 14:05.200
you got to bring them back into the workforce somehow and they got to get some kind of

14:05.200 --> 14:09.600
contemporary skills. And if you took that approach, you can bring them back into the

14:09.600 --> 14:14.400
workforce. Yeah, I think some interesting combination of humility and passion,

14:14.400 --> 14:20.880
because like you said, experts sometimes lack humility if they call themselves an expert for

14:20.880 --> 14:25.840
a few too many years. So you have to have that beginner's mind and a passion to be able to

14:26.400 --> 14:30.320
aggressively constantly be a beginner at everything and learn and learn and learn.

14:30.320 --> 14:35.680
You know, I saw it firsthand when we were beginning this path, you know, down the cloud and AI

14:35.680 --> 14:41.840
and we said, and people would say, Oh, IBM, you know, it's existential, they got to change and

14:41.840 --> 14:46.080
all these things. And, and I did hire a lot of people from outside, very willing to learn new

14:46.080 --> 14:51.520
things. Come on in, come on in. And I sometimes say shiny objects, trained in shiny objects,

14:51.520 --> 14:56.160
come on in. But I saw something, it was another one of these, you're not a shiny object. I'm not

14:56.160 --> 15:04.640
saying that. But I learned something. Okay, some of them did fantastic. And others, they're like,

15:04.640 --> 15:09.200
well, let me school you on everything. But they didn't realize like we did really mission critical

15:09.200 --> 15:13.520
work. And they break a bank. I mean, they would not understand the certain kind of security and

15:13.520 --> 15:19.520
the auditability and everything they had to go on. And then I watched IBM people say, Oh, I actually

15:19.520 --> 15:23.120
could learn some something like, yeah, okay, I don't know how to do that's a really good thing

15:23.120 --> 15:27.680
I could learn. And in the end, there was not like one group was a winner and was a loser.

15:27.680 --> 15:31.120
The winners were the people who were willing to learn from each other. I mean, it was to me,

15:31.120 --> 15:37.760
it was very stark example of that point. And I saw it firsthand. So that's why I'm so committed

15:37.760 --> 15:43.040
to this idea about skills first. And that's how people should be hired, promoted, paid, you name

15:43.040 --> 15:51.120
it. Yeah, the AI in general, it seems like nobody really understands now what the future will look

15:51.120 --> 15:55.280
like. We're all trying to figure it out. So like what, you know, IBM will look like in 50 years,

15:56.000 --> 16:00.480
in relation to the software business to AI is unknown, what Google will look like,

16:00.480 --> 16:06.000
what all these companies were trying to figure it out. And that means constantly learning,

16:06.880 --> 16:11.440
taking risks, all of those things. And nobody is really skilled in AI.

16:12.480 --> 16:16.320
Because you're absolutely right. That's right. I couldn't agree more with you on that.

16:17.040 --> 16:23.760
You, you wrote in the book, speaking of hiring, quote, my drive for perfection often meant

16:24.720 --> 16:30.000
I only focused on what needed to change without acknowledging the positive. This could keep people

16:30.000 --> 16:34.880
from trusting themselves. It could take me a while to learn that just because I could point

16:34.880 --> 16:40.400
something out didn't mean I should. I still spotted errors, but I became more deliberate about what I

16:40.400 --> 16:45.680
mentioned and sent back to get fixed. I also tried to curtail my tendency to micromanage

16:45.680 --> 16:51.920
and let people execute. I had to stop assuming my way was the best or only way. I was learning

16:51.920 --> 16:56.720
that giving other people control builds their confidence and that constantly trying to control

16:56.720 --> 17:04.560
people destroys it. So what's the right balance between showing the way and helping people find

17:04.560 --> 17:13.440
the way? That is a good question. Because like a really flip answer would be as it gets bigger,

17:13.440 --> 17:20.320
you have no choice but to just, you know, you can't do it. You have to tell or show. I mean,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.880
you've got to let people find their way because it's so big, you can't, right?

17:26.240 --> 17:30.800
That's an obvious answer. Scope of work, bigger it gets. Okay, I've got to let more stuff go.

17:32.640 --> 17:42.400
But I have always believed that a leader's job is to do as well. And I think there's like a few areas

17:43.760 --> 17:50.160
that are really important that you always do. Now it doesn't mean you're showing. So like when it has

17:50.160 --> 17:54.800
to do with values and value-based decisions, like I think it's really important to constantly

17:56.480 --> 18:02.800
show people that you walk your talk on that kind of thing. It's super important. And I actually

18:02.800 --> 18:07.280
think it's a struggle young companies have because those values aren't deeply rooted.

18:07.360 --> 18:14.720
And when a storm comes, it's easy to uproot. And so I always felt like when it was that time,

18:14.720 --> 18:22.240
I showed it. I got taught that so young at IBM and even General Motors that, in fact, I do write

18:22.240 --> 18:29.600
about that in the book. First time I was a manager, I had a gentleman telling dirty jokes. And not to

18:29.600 --> 18:37.120
me, but to other people. And it really offended people and some of the women. This is the very

18:37.120 --> 18:44.080
early 80s. And they came, said something. I talked to my boss. I'm a first-time manager.

18:44.720 --> 18:49.920
And he was unequivocal with what I should do. He said, and this was a top performer.

18:49.920 --> 18:55.200
It stops immediately or you fire him. So there are a few areas like that that I actually think

18:55.200 --> 19:01.360
you have to always continue to role model and show, right? That to me isn't the kind that like,

19:01.360 --> 19:06.400
when do you let go of stuff, right? So- The values and relationships with clients.

19:06.400 --> 19:11.040
Yeah, whatever you're in service of. And the other thing was, I really felt it was really

19:11.040 --> 19:17.120
important to role model learning, right? So, you know, I can remember when we started down the

19:17.120 --> 19:23.040
journey and we went on to this thing called the Think Academy, IBM's longtime motto had been think.

19:23.040 --> 19:27.520
And we said, okay, I'm going to make the first Friday of every month compulsory education.

19:28.320 --> 19:33.120
And, okay, I mean, everybody, like everybody, I don't care what your job is, okay? When the

19:33.120 --> 19:37.200
whole company has to transform, everybody's got to kind of have some skin in this game and understand

19:37.200 --> 19:43.680
it. I taught the first hour of every month for four years. Now, okay, I had to learn something.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.040
But it made me learn, but I've like, okay, if I can teach this, you can do it, right? I mean,

19:49.040 --> 19:53.120
you know, kind of thing. So it was a compulsory Thursday night education for you.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.200
I'm a little bit better prepared than that, but yes, you're so right. Yes.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.920
So you prepare. Yeah. So like personality wise, you like to prepare?

20:01.920 --> 20:06.240
Yeah. But there's roots in that go back deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply. And I think

20:06.800 --> 20:11.120
it's an interesting reason. So why do, why are you, you're prepared, my friend? Yeah. Yes,

20:11.120 --> 20:16.800
you are. You prepare for your interviews. Uh, sure. The rest you wing. Yeah, I wing.

20:16.800 --> 20:20.480
But that's okay. I mean, you don't have to prepare everything. I don't prepare everything either.

20:20.480 --> 20:25.760
No, but I, I unfortunately wing stuff. I save it to last minute. I push everything. I'm always

20:25.760 --> 20:30.080
almost late and I don't know why that is. I mean, there's some deep psychological thing

20:30.080 --> 20:34.720
we should probably investigate, but it's probably the anxiety brings out the performance.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.800
That can be. That's very true with some people. I mean, so I'm a program and engineer at heart.

20:38.800 --> 20:44.880
And so, so programmers famously overestimate or underestimate, sorry, how long that something's

20:44.880 --> 20:50.160
going to take. And so I just, everything always underestimate. And it's almost as if I want

20:50.720 --> 20:56.720
to feel this chaos of anxiety of a deadline or something like this. Otherwise I'll be lazy

20:56.720 --> 21:00.720
sitting on a beach with a pina colada and relaxing. I don't know. So that we have to

21:00.720 --> 21:06.080
know ourselves, but for you, you like to prepare. Yeah. It came from a few different places. I mean,

21:06.080 --> 21:14.480
one would have been as a, as a kid, I think, um, I was not a memorizer and my brother is brilliant.

21:14.480 --> 21:19.840
He can, he, he read it once, boom, done. And so I always want to understand like how something

21:19.840 --> 21:24.480
happened. It didn't matter what it was I was doing, whether it was algebra, theorems. I always wanted

21:24.480 --> 21:26.880
don't give me the answer. Don't give me the answer. You know, I want to figure it out,

21:26.880 --> 21:31.600
figure it out. So I could reproduce it again and didn't have to memorize. So it started with that.

21:31.600 --> 21:38.320
And then over time, okay, so I was in university in the seventies when I was in engineering school.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.840
I was the only woman, you know, I meet people still to this day and they're like, oh, I remember

21:41.840 --> 21:47.120
you. I'm like, yeah, sorry. I don't remember you. There were 30 of you, one of me. And I think you

21:47.120 --> 21:50.640
already get that feeling of, okay, I better really study hard. Cause whatever I say is going to be

21:50.640 --> 21:58.320
remembered in this class, good or bad. And it started there. So in some ways I did it for two

21:58.320 --> 22:04.720
reasons. Early on, I think it was a shield for confidence. The more I studied, the more prepared

22:04.720 --> 22:10.480
I was, the more confident. That's probably still true to this day. The, the second reason I did it

22:10.480 --> 22:16.880
evolved over time and became different to prepare. Um, if I was really prepared, then when we're in

22:16.880 --> 22:21.600
the moment, I can really listen to you. See, cause I don't have to be doing all this stuff on the

22:21.600 --> 22:27.920
fly in my head. And I could actually take things I know and maybe help the situation. So it really

22:27.920 --> 22:34.720
became a way that I could be present and in the moment. And I think it's something a lot of people

22:34.720 --> 22:38.720
that in the moment, I learned it from my husband. He doesn't prepare by the way at all. So that's

22:38.720 --> 22:44.880
not it. But I, but I, but I watched the negative example. No, no, no. And I'm not going to change

22:44.880 --> 22:50.240
that. As he says, it's a type Z, I'm an A. Okay. And I have been married 43 years and that seems

22:50.240 --> 22:55.920
to work. So, but that idea that you could be in the moment with people is a really important thing.

22:56.640 --> 23:02.720
Yeah. So the preparation gives you the freedom to really be present. So just to linger on the,

23:02.720 --> 23:07.360
you mentioned your brother and it seems like in the book that you really had to

23:08.640 --> 23:14.000
work hard when you study to, to, to sort of, um, given that you weren't good at memorization,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.080
you really truly deeply wanted to understand the stuff and you put in the hard work and that seems

23:18.080 --> 23:23.600
to persist throughout your career. So, um, you know, hard work is often associated with, um,

23:24.480 --> 23:29.120
sort of has negative associations with maybe with burnout, with dissatisfaction.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.760
Is there some aspect of hard work at the core of who you are that led to happiness for you?

23:37.120 --> 23:41.280
Did you enjoy it? I enjoyed it. So I will be the first and I'm,

23:41.280 --> 23:45.200
I'm really careful to say that to people because I don't think everyone should associate, gee,

23:45.200 --> 23:50.480
to do what you did, you have to, there's only one route there, right? And that's just not true.

23:50.480 --> 23:55.280
And I, I do it because I like it. In fact, I'm careful. And as time goes on, you have to be

23:55.280 --> 23:59.120
careful as more and more people watch you, whether you like it, you're a role model or not, you are a

23:59.120 --> 24:03.200
role model for people, whether you know it, like it, want it, does not matter. I learned that the

24:03.200 --> 24:07.360
hard way. And I would have to say to people, hey, just cause I do this does not mean I do it for

24:07.360 --> 24:12.720
these reasons, right? It's a V really explicit. And I'd come to believe usually when people say

24:12.720 --> 24:15.920
the word power, I don't know, do you have a positive or negative notion? When I say the word

24:15.920 --> 24:20.400
power, we'll just do it. Probably negative one. Yeah. For some stereotype or some view that,

24:20.400 --> 24:25.040
that it's somebody's abused it in some way. You can read the newspaper, somebody's doing something

24:26.480 --> 24:29.360
personal people. Like I'll ask people, do you want power? And they're like, oh no,

24:29.360 --> 24:34.640
I'd rather do good. Yeah. And I think the irony is you need power to do good.

24:35.280 --> 24:41.840
And so that sort of led me down to, and it was, I thought about my own life, right? Cause it's,

24:41.840 --> 24:48.000
it starts in a, like many of us, you know, you don't have a lot, but you don't know that cause

24:48.000 --> 24:53.440
you're like everybody else around you at that time. And I want to end tragedy, right? My father

24:53.440 --> 24:59.200
leaves my mother homeless, no money, no food, nothing, four kids. She's never worked a day

24:59.200 --> 25:04.800
in her life outside of a home. And I, the irony that I hear, I would end up as the ninth CEO

25:04.800 --> 25:10.240
of one of America's iconic companies. And now I co-chair this group 110 and that journey,

25:10.240 --> 25:14.560
I said, the biggest thing I learned was you could do really hard, meaningful things in a positive

25:14.560 --> 25:20.240
way. So now you asked me about why do I work so hard? I ended up writing the book in three pieces

25:21.200 --> 25:27.040
for this reason. When you really think of your life and power, I thought it kind of fell like

25:27.040 --> 25:32.480
a pebble in water. Like there's a ring about, you really care about yourself and like the

25:32.480 --> 25:37.520
power of yourself, power of me. There's a time it transcends to that you are working with and for

25:37.520 --> 25:43.600
others in another moment when it becomes like about society. So my hard work, I'd ask you,

25:44.400 --> 25:49.040
one day sit really hard and think about when you close your eyes, who do you see from your early

25:49.040 --> 25:53.280
life? Right? And what did you learn? And maybe it's not that hard for you. I mean, it was,

25:53.280 --> 26:00.640
it's funny the things then, if I really looked at it, it's no surprise what I do today.

26:00.640 --> 26:07.200
And that hard work part, my great grandma, as you and I were comparing notes on Russia, right? And

26:08.160 --> 26:12.160
never spoke English, spoke Russian, came here to this country, was a cleaning person at the

26:12.160 --> 26:18.560
Wrigley building in Chicago. Yet if she hadn't saved every dime she made, my mother wouldn't

26:18.560 --> 26:22.800
have a home and wouldn't have had a car, right? What did I learn from that hard work? In fact,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.880
when I went to college, she's like, you know, you really should be on a farm. You're so big and

26:26.880 --> 26:34.640
strong. You know, that was her view. And then my grandmother, another tragic life. What did she do

26:34.640 --> 26:40.880
though? And think how long, that's in the forties, the fifties, she made lampshades. And she taught me

26:40.880 --> 26:46.720
how to sew, right? So I could sew clothes when we couldn't afford them. But my memory of my grandma

26:46.720 --> 26:54.000
is working seven days a week, sewing lampshades. And then here comes my mom in her situation,

26:54.000 --> 27:00.720
who climbs her way out of it. So I associate that with, well, strong women, by the way,

27:01.440 --> 27:08.560
all strong women. And I associate hard work with how you are sure you can always take care of

27:08.560 --> 27:12.880
yourself. And so I think that the roots go way back there. And they were always teaching

27:12.880 --> 27:16.000
something, right? My great grandma was teaching me how to cook, how to work a farm, even though

27:16.000 --> 27:20.800
I didn't need to be on a farm. My grandma taught me, you know, here's how to sew, here's how to run

27:20.800 --> 27:25.440
a business. And then my mother would teach us that, look, but just a little bit of education,

27:25.440 --> 27:29.200
look at the difference it could make, right? So anyways, that's a long answer too. I think

27:29.200 --> 27:35.120
that hard work thing is really deeply rooted from that background. It gives you a way out

27:35.120 --> 27:41.920
from hard times. Yeah, you know, I think I've seen you on other podcasts say, I thought I did,

27:41.920 --> 27:46.560
do you want a plan B? Didn't you say, no, you would not like a plan B?

27:46.560 --> 27:50.240
Yeah. Because you're like, I would prefer my back up against, am I remembering?

27:52.240 --> 27:59.680
You seem to like, at least certain moments in your life seem to do well in desperate times.

27:59.680 --> 28:07.440
True enough. True enough, that's true. I learned that very well. But I also think that maybe this

28:07.440 --> 28:12.160
isn't the same kind of plan B. I think of it as, like I was taught, like, always be able to take

28:12.160 --> 28:18.800
care of yourself. Don't have to rely on someone else. And I think that to me, so that's my plan

28:18.800 --> 28:24.240
B, I can take care of myself. And it's even after what I lived through with my father, I thought,

28:24.240 --> 28:30.400
well, this set a bar for bad. After this, nothing's bad. And that is a very freeing thought.

28:31.200 --> 28:35.440
Being able to take care of yourself, is that, you mean practically or do you mean just a

28:35.440 --> 28:39.280
self-belief that I'll figure it out? I'll figure it out and practically both, right?

28:40.000 --> 28:46.800
So you wrote, quote, I vividly remember the last two weeks of my freshman year, when I only had

28:46.800 --> 28:53.360
25 cents left. I put the quarter in a clear plastic box on my desk and just stared at it.

28:53.360 --> 29:00.240
This is it, I thought. No more money. So do you think there's some aspect of that financial

29:00.240 --> 29:07.280
stress, even desperation, just being hungry, does that play a role in that drive that led

29:07.280 --> 29:11.360
to your success to be the CEO of one of the great companies ever?

29:11.360 --> 29:15.680
It's a really interesting question because I was just talking to another colleague who was

29:15.680 --> 29:21.680
CEO of another great American company this weekend. And he mentioned to me about all this

29:21.680 --> 29:28.000
adversity and he said, or I said to him, I said, do you think part of your success is because you

29:28.000 --> 29:37.280
had bad stuff happen? And he said, yes, you know? And so I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say,

29:37.280 --> 29:42.240
I don't think you have to have tragedy, but it does teach you like one really important thing

29:42.240 --> 29:46.080
is that there is always a way forward, always, and it's in your control.

29:46.080 --> 29:50.720
I think there's probably wisdom for mentorship there or whether you're a parent or a mentor

29:51.680 --> 29:57.040
that easy times don't result in growth. Yeah, I've heard a lot of my friends and

29:57.280 --> 30:02.960
they worry, they say, geez, my kids have never had bad times. And so what happens here? So

30:02.960 --> 30:09.360
I don't know, is it required and why you end up? Not required, but it sure doesn't hurt.

30:09.360 --> 30:14.640
You had this good line about advice you were given that growth and comfort never coexist.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.680
Growth and comfort never coexist. And you have to get used to that thought.

30:19.680 --> 30:23.600
If someone said that they think of me like one of the more profound sort of lessons I had,

30:24.480 --> 30:31.040
and the irony is it's from my husband, which is even more funny actually.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.120
You could just steal it. I mean, you don't have to give him credit.

30:33.120 --> 30:39.680
I have, shamelessly, as he'll tell you. Okay, so the story behind growth and comfort never coexist,

30:39.680 --> 30:45.360
but honestly, I think it's been a really freeing thought for me and it's helped me immensely since

30:46.320 --> 30:54.400
mid-career. And as I write about it in the book, I'm mid-career and I've been running a pretty big

30:54.400 --> 30:58.080
business actually. And the fella I work for is going to get a new job. It's going to get promoted.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.680
He calls me and he says, hey, you're going to get my job. I really want you to have it.

31:01.680 --> 31:07.040
And I said to him, no way. I said, I'm not ready for that job. I got a lot more things I got to

31:07.040 --> 31:12.800
learn. That is like a huge job. Around the world, every product line, development, you name it,

31:12.800 --> 31:17.920
every function, I can't do it. He looked at me. He says, well, I think you should go to the

31:17.920 --> 31:24.080
interview. I went to the interview the next day, blah, blah, blah. Guy says to me, looks at me and

31:24.080 --> 31:30.400
he says, I want to offer you that job. And I said, I would like to think about it. I said,

31:30.400 --> 31:36.960
I want to go home and talk to my husband about it. Kind of looked at me. Okay. I went home.

31:36.960 --> 31:41.600
My husband is sitting there and he says to me, I went on and on about the story, et cetera. And he

31:41.600 --> 31:49.920
says, do you think a man would have answered it that way? And I said, he says, I know you. He's

31:49.920 --> 31:55.120
like, six months, you're going to be bored. And all you can think of is what you don't know. And

31:55.120 --> 31:59.120
he said, and I know these other people, you have way more skill than them and they think they could

31:59.120 --> 32:09.120
do it. And he's like, why? And for me, it internalized this feeling that I am going to say something

32:09.120 --> 32:14.160
is a bit stereotype that it resonates with many, many women. And I'll ask you if it does after,

32:14.160 --> 32:20.800
is that they're most harsh critic of themselves. And so this idea that I won't grow unless I can

32:20.800 --> 32:25.040
feel uncomfortable doesn't mean I always have to show it by the way. So that's why I meant growth

32:25.040 --> 32:31.280
and comfort can never coexist. So I got, I was like, he's exactly right. Now the end of that story

32:31.280 --> 32:35.760
is I went in and I took the job. When I went back to the man who was really my mentor looking out

32:35.760 --> 32:41.760
for me and he, he looked at me and he said, don't ever do that again. And I said, I understand

32:41.760 --> 32:45.200
because it was okay to be uncomfortable. I didn't have to use it. I mean,

32:46.480 --> 32:52.480
now I would take stock of the things I can do. Right. And really think, or I look for times to

32:52.480 --> 32:57.840
be uncomfortable because I know if I am nervous, like, I don't know if you're nervous to meet me.

32:57.840 --> 33:02.800
We never met in real person. I'm still terrified. No, you're not. But then you're, it means you're

33:02.800 --> 33:10.640
learning something, right? So that to me matters. I think it's interesting. Maybe you could speak

33:10.640 --> 33:15.280
to that, the sort of the self-critical thing inside your, inside your brain. Cause I think

33:16.720 --> 33:25.680
sometimes it's talked about that women have that. But I have that definitely. And I think that's not

33:25.680 --> 33:31.120
just solely a property of women in the workplace, but I also want to sort of push back on the idea

33:31.120 --> 33:37.920
that that's a bad thing that you should silence. Cause I think that anxiety that leads to growth

33:37.920 --> 33:42.320
also, that's like this discomfort. So there's this weird balance you have to have between that

33:42.320 --> 33:46.560
self-critical engine and confidence. Yeah, I think that's a good point. You have to kind of dance

33:46.560 --> 33:50.640
because if you're super confident, people will value you higher. That's important. But if you're

33:50.640 --> 33:54.640
way too confident, maybe in the short term you'll gain, but in the long term, you won't grow.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.520
Very good point. So I can't really disagree with that. And to me, even when I took on jobs,

34:00.160 --> 34:04.800
I always felt people say, well, is it, you know, what point are you confident enough? And I came

34:04.800 --> 34:10.000
to sort of believe again, a theme of my beliefs that if I was willing to ask lots of questions

34:10.000 --> 34:16.160
and understood enough, that's all I needed to know. Let me ask you about your husband a little bit.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.360
So you write in the book, you write in the book. He's just jumping around. Like I said,

34:21.360 --> 34:26.560
I'm a bit of a romantic. So how did you meet your husband? So I met my husband when I was 19 years

34:26.560 --> 34:34.800
old. So I was a young kid. And I met him when I had a General Motors scholarship. So I was

34:34.800 --> 34:39.360
at Northwestern University through my first two years, had a lot of loans, financial aid.

34:40.080 --> 34:45.600
And a professor said, hey, you should sign up for this interview. They're looking to bring forward

34:45.600 --> 34:50.240
diverse candidates through their management track. Now these programs don't exist anymore like that.

34:50.240 --> 34:55.200
They will pay your tuition, your room and board, your expenses. Northwestern, other Ivy League

34:55.680 --> 35:02.000
very expensive schools. And I think you'd be a good fit. I am eternally thankful for that advice.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.080
I went in, I interviewed, I actually got the scholarship. I mean, without it, I'd have

35:06.080 --> 35:11.600
graduated with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. So part of that was in the summer,

35:11.600 --> 35:16.720
I had to work in Detroit. I lived in a little room by a cement plant. Not theirs, but I mean,

35:16.720 --> 35:21.040
that's all I could afford. Very romantic. Very, very romantic. And the person who owned the house

35:21.040 --> 35:24.800
said, you know, hey, I'm having a party. You're not invited. I'm going to fix you up with someone

35:24.800 --> 35:31.360
tonight. And that turned out to be my husband. And so it was a blind date is, is how we very

35:31.360 --> 35:37.120
first met. And then it was over. It was, the story was written. Yep. Let's, if it's okay,

35:37.120 --> 35:42.800
just zoom out to, you mentioned power and good power a few times. So if we can just even talk

35:42.800 --> 35:47.520
about it. Your book is called Good Power, Leading Positive Change in Our Lives, Work and World.

35:48.480 --> 35:54.320
What is good power? What's the essence of good power? So the essence of it would be doing

35:54.320 --> 36:01.600
something hard or meaningful, but in a positive way. I would also tell you, I hope one day

36:02.720 --> 36:07.840
I'm remembered for how I did things, not just for what I did. I think that could almost be

36:07.840 --> 36:11.680
more important. And I think it's a choice we can all make. So the essence to me of good power,

36:11.680 --> 36:19.120
if I had a contrast, good to bad, let's say, would be that first off, you have to embrace

36:19.200 --> 36:25.600
and navigate tension. This is the world we live in. And by embracing tension, not running from it,

36:26.240 --> 36:30.640
you would bridge divides that unites people, not divides them. It's a hard thing to do,

36:30.640 --> 36:35.680
but you can do it. You do it with respect, which is the opposite of fear. A lot of people think

36:35.680 --> 36:40.960
the way to get things done is fear. And then the third thing would be, you got to celebrate some

36:40.960 --> 36:46.880
progress versus perfection. Because I also think that's what stops a lot of things from happening,

36:46.880 --> 36:53.040
because if you go for whatever your definition of perfect is, it's either polarization or

36:53.040 --> 36:59.280
parallelization. I mean, something happens in there. Versus, no, no, no. Don't worry about

36:59.280 --> 37:04.800
getting to that actual exact endpoint. If I keep taking a step forward, a progress, really tough

37:04.800 --> 37:11.360
stuff can get done. And so my view of that is like, honestly, I hope it can, I said it's like a

37:11.360 --> 37:16.320
memoir with purpose. I'm only doing it. It was a really hard thing for me to do because I don't

37:16.320 --> 37:21.440
actually talk about all these things. And I had to, nobody cares about your scientific description

37:21.440 --> 37:26.160
of this. They want the stories in your life to bring it alive. So it's a memoir with purpose.

37:26.160 --> 37:31.760
And in the writing of it, it became the power of me, the power of we, and the power of us. The idea

37:31.760 --> 37:38.240
that you build a foundation when you're young, mostly from my work life, the power of we, which

37:38.240 --> 37:46.080
says, I kind of, in retrospect, could see five principles on how to really drive change that

37:46.560 --> 37:52.160
be done in a good way. And then eventually you could scale that, the power really of us,

37:52.160 --> 37:56.720
which is what I'm doing about finding better jobs for more people now that I co-chair an

37:56.720 --> 38:04.640
organization called 110. So that essence of navigate tensions, do it respectfully,

38:04.640 --> 38:12.880
celebrate progress, and indulge me one more minute, these sort of, again, it's retrospect

38:12.880 --> 38:17.120
that I didn't know this in the moment. I had to learn it. I learned it. I am blessed by a lot

38:17.120 --> 38:24.640
of people I worked with and around. But some of the principles, like the first one says,

38:26.080 --> 38:31.280
if you're going to do something, change something, do something, you got to be in service of

38:31.280 --> 38:38.720
something. Being in service of is really different than serving. Super different. And like I just

38:38.720 --> 38:44.240
had my knee replaced. And I interviewed all these doctors. You can tell the difference that the guy

38:44.240 --> 38:47.280
was going to do a surgery, hey, my surgery is fine. I really don't care whether you can walk and do

38:47.280 --> 38:50.400
the stuff you wanted to do again, but because my surgery is fine. Your hardware is good.

38:51.440 --> 38:55.760
I actually had some trouble. And I had a doctor who was like, you know, this doesn't sound right.

38:55.760 --> 39:02.400
I'm coming to you. The surgery was fine. It was me that was reacting wrong to it. And he didn't care

39:02.400 --> 39:07.040
until I could walk again. Okay, there's a big difference in those two things. And it's true in

39:07.040 --> 39:13.120
any business you have. A waiter serves your food. Okay, he serves his food. He did his job. Or did

39:13.120 --> 39:18.000
he care? He had a good time. So that thought to be in service of, it took me a while to get that,

39:18.000 --> 39:21.680
like to try to write it, to get that across, because I think it's like so fundamental.

39:22.640 --> 39:28.720
If people were really in service of something, you got to believe that if I fulfill your needs

39:28.720 --> 39:35.200
at the end of the day, mine will be fulfilled. And that is that essence that makes it so different.

39:35.760 --> 39:40.560
And then the second part, second principle is about building belief, which is I got to hope you'll

39:40.560 --> 39:45.120
voluntarily believe in a new future or some alternate reality. And you will use your

39:45.120 --> 39:51.120
discretionary energy versus me ordering you. You'll get so much more done. Then the third change

39:51.120 --> 39:57.280
in Endure. We kind of talked about that earlier. Focus more on the how and the skills. And then the

39:57.280 --> 40:05.440
part on good tech and being resilient. So anyways, I just felt that like good tech, everybody's a tech

40:05.440 --> 40:09.920
company. I don't care what you do today. And there's some fundamental things you got to do.

40:09.920 --> 40:17.360
In fact, pick up today's any newspaper, right? Chat, GPT, you're an AI guy. All right. I believe

40:17.360 --> 40:22.000
one of the tenets of good tech is it's like responsibility for the long term. It says,

40:22.000 --> 40:25.600
so if you're going to invent something, you better look at its upside and its downside.

40:25.600 --> 40:30.720
Like we did quantum computing. Great. A lot of great stuff, right? Materials development,

40:31.440 --> 40:37.280
risk management calculations, endless lists one day. On the other side, it can break encryption.

40:37.280 --> 40:43.040
That's a bad thing. So we worked equally hard on all the algorithms that would sustain quantum.

40:43.840 --> 40:50.880
I think with chat, okay, great. There's people working on it, but like, okay,

40:50.880 --> 40:56.240
the things that say, hey, I can tell this was written with that, right? Because the implications

40:56.240 --> 41:00.160
on how people learn, right? If this is not a great thing, if all it does is do your homework,

41:00.160 --> 41:04.720
that is not the idea of homework as someone who liked to study so hard. But anyways,

41:04.720 --> 41:06.960
you get my point. It's just the upside and the downside.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.640
And that there could be much larger implications that are much more difficult to predict than

41:10.640 --> 41:14.640
it's our responsibility to really work hard to figure that out.

41:14.640 --> 41:18.320
I was talking AI ethics a decade ago and I'm like, why won't anybody listen to us?

41:20.480 --> 41:24.400
That's another one of those values things that you realize, hey, if I'm going to bring technology

41:24.400 --> 41:30.080
in the world, I better bring it safely. And that to me comes with when you're an older company

41:30.080 --> 41:34.960
that's been around, you realize that society gave you a licensed outbreak and it can take it away.

41:35.440 --> 41:40.960
And we see that happen to companies and therefore you're like, okay, like why I feel so strong

41:40.960 --> 41:44.640
about skills. Hey, if I'm going to bring in, it's going to create all these new jobs,

41:44.640 --> 41:48.720
job dislocation, then I should help. I'm trying to help people get new skills.

41:48.720 --> 41:54.880
Anyways, that's a long answer to a good tech, but the idea that there's kind of in retrospect,

41:54.880 --> 42:00.800
a set of principles you could look at and maybe learn something from my sort of rocky road through

42:00.800 --> 42:06.800
there. But it started with the power of we, and there's that big leap I think that propagates

42:06.800 --> 42:10.800
through the things you're saying, which is the leap from focusing on yourself to the focusing

42:10.800 --> 42:16.080
on others. So that having that empathy, you've said at some point in our lives and careers,

42:16.080 --> 42:21.120
our attention turns from ourselves to others. We still have our own goals, but we recognize

42:21.120 --> 42:26.960
that our actions affect many, that it is impossible to achieve anything truly meaningful alone.

42:26.960 --> 42:34.480
So it's, to you, I think maybe you can correct me, but ultimate good power is about collaboration.

42:35.360 --> 42:42.240
And maybe in a large company, it's like delegation on great teams.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.520
The ultimate good power is actually doing something for society. That would be my

42:45.520 --> 42:48.080
ultimate definition of good power by the way. So it's about the results of the thing.

42:48.080 --> 42:52.400
Yeah. But how it's done, right? The how it's done. And so,

42:53.120 --> 42:58.960
um, you know, when you said a leap, do you think people make a leap when they go from thinking

42:58.960 --> 43:02.880
about themselves to others? Do you think it's a leap or do you think it kind of just is a sort of

43:02.880 --> 43:11.040
slow point? I think the leap is in deciding that this is a, it's like deciding that you will

43:11.920 --> 43:16.400
care about others, that this is, it's like, it's like a leap of going to the gym for the first time.

43:16.400 --> 43:20.800
It's yes, it takes a long time to develop that and to actually care. But the decision that I'm

43:20.800 --> 43:25.760
going to actually care about other human beings. Yeah. Yeah. I think, or at least like, yeah,

43:25.760 --> 43:30.160
it just feels like a deliberate action you take of empathy. Yeah. Cause sometimes I think it

43:30.160 --> 43:34.560
happens a little, it's maybe not as deliberate. Yeah. It's a little bit more gradual because

43:34.560 --> 43:38.640
it might happen because you realize that, geez, I can't get this done alone. So I gotta have other

43:38.640 --> 43:43.520
people with me, but how do I get them to help me do something? So I think it does help happen a

43:43.520 --> 43:48.400
little bit more gradually. And as you get more confident, you start to not think so much that

43:48.400 --> 43:52.720
it's about you and you start to think about this other thing you're trying to accomplish.

43:52.720 --> 43:58.960
And so that's why I felt it was a little more gradual. I also felt like I can remember so well,

44:00.160 --> 44:07.520
you know, this idea that, again, now we're in the eighties, nineties, I'm a woman,

44:07.520 --> 44:14.960
I'm in technology and I was down in Australia at a conference and I gave this great speech,

44:14.960 --> 44:18.480
again, meet power, you know, I'm thinking I give this great speech, financial services,

44:18.480 --> 44:21.920
this guy walks, man walks up to me after I think he's going to like ask me some great question.

44:22.560 --> 44:27.600
And he said to me, I wish my daughter could have been here. And in that moment,

44:29.440 --> 44:33.520
and I, and at that point up to then I'd always been about, look, please don't notice I'm a woman,

44:33.520 --> 44:39.120
do not notice that I am, I just want to be recognized for my work, but crossing over from

44:39.120 --> 44:46.080
me to we like it or not, I was a role model for some number of people. And maybe I didn't want

44:46.080 --> 44:51.040
to be, but that didn't really matter. So I could either accept that and embrace it or not. I think

44:51.040 --> 44:54.880
it's a good example of that transition. I did have a little epiphany with that happening.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.200
And then I'm like, okay, because I would always be like, no, I won't go on a women's conference.

44:59.200 --> 45:04.320
I won't talk here. I won't, you know, no, no, no. But then I sort of realized, wait a second,

45:04.320 --> 45:09.920
you know, that old saying, you cannot be what you cannot see. And I said to myself,

45:09.920 --> 45:14.560
what? Oh, wait a second. Okay. I am in these positions. I have a responsibility to,

45:15.200 --> 45:20.400
and it's to others. And that's what I meant. I felt like it can be somewhat gradual that you come

45:20.400 --> 45:25.280
and you may have these like pivotal moments that you see it, but then you feel it and you sort of

45:25.280 --> 45:31.760
move over that transom into the power of we, you're one of the most powerful tech leaders ever.

45:32.720 --> 45:36.960
And as you mentioned the word power, you know, the old saying goes, power corrupts and absolute

45:36.960 --> 45:49.120
power corrupts. Absolutely. Was there an aspect of power that was that you had to resist its ability

45:49.120 --> 45:55.200
to corrupt your mind, to sort of delude you into thinking you're smarter than you are, that kind

45:55.200 --> 45:59.200
of all the ways. That's very dangerous. I agree with that. I mean, I think you got to be careful

45:59.360 --> 46:03.680
who you surround yourself with. That's how I would answer that question. Right. And people who will

46:03.680 --> 46:07.360
hold the mirror up to you can be done in a very positive way, by the way, it doesn't mean, you

46:07.360 --> 46:12.800
know, but that we're sycophants, you cannot have that. Right. I mean, it's like, I would say to

46:12.800 --> 46:17.200
someone like, Hey, listen to me, tell me, I mean, tell me what would make me better or do something.

46:17.200 --> 46:21.920
Or I have a husband that'll do that for me quite easily, by the way. He'll always tell me.

46:21.920 --> 46:26.400
He's the one that kind of, he, I have, I have been surrounded myself with a number of people that

46:26.400 --> 46:31.040
will do that. And I think you have to have that. I had a woman that worked with me for a very long

46:31.040 --> 46:36.240
time. And at one time we were competitors. And then at some point she started to work for me

46:36.240 --> 46:39.920
and stayed with me for credit. And she was one of the few people that would tell me the truth.

46:39.920 --> 46:45.200
And, you know, sometimes I'm like enough already. And, and she'd be like, do not roll your eyes at

46:45.200 --> 46:51.040
this. And you absolutely have got to have that. And I think it also comes, it'll go back to my

46:51.040 --> 46:56.000
complete commitment to inclusion and diversity, because you got to have that variety around you.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.880
You'll get a better product and a better answer at the end of the day. And so that, to resist that

47:00.880 --> 47:05.440
allure, I think it's around who, about who you surround yourself with. I guess current politics

47:05.440 --> 47:10.640
would say that too. So you, you write about, and in general you value diversity a lot. So

47:11.520 --> 47:14.800
can you speak to almost like philosophically, what does diversity mean to you?

47:15.680 --> 47:22.960
Diversity to me means I'm going to get a better product, a better answer. I value different views

47:23.600 --> 47:29.280
and so it's inclusion. So I always say inclusion, diversity is a number, inclusion is a choice.

47:30.560 --> 47:36.480
And you can make that choice every single day. That's a good line. I really believe, and I've

47:36.480 --> 47:40.800
witnessed it, that I've had, when my teams are diverse, I get a better answer. My friends are

47:40.800 --> 47:47.120
diverse. I have a better life. I mean, all these kinds of things. And so I also believe it's like

47:47.120 --> 47:51.280
no silver thread. There's no easy way. You have to authentically believe it. I mean, do you

47:51.280 --> 47:57.520
authentically believe that diversity is a good thing? Yeah. But I believe that diversity,

47:57.520 --> 47:59.920
like broadly- A thought, I very broadly define it.

47:59.920 --> 48:05.680
Yeah. So like there's, you know, sometimes the way diversity is looked at, the way diversity is used

48:05.680 --> 48:10.720
today is like surface level characteristics, which are also important, but they're usually reflective

48:10.720 --> 48:14.960
of something else, which is a diversity of background, a diversity of thought, a diversity

48:14.960 --> 48:22.000
of struggle. Some people that grow up middle-class versus poor, different countries,

48:22.000 --> 48:26.560
different motivations, all of that. Yeah. It's beautiful when different people from very different

48:26.560 --> 48:31.440
walks of life get together. Yeah. It's beautiful to see. But like sometimes it's very difficult to get

48:32.480 --> 48:37.040
at that on a sheet of paper of the characteristics that defines the diversity.

48:37.040 --> 48:41.040
I know. So it is. It's just like, oh, I can't hire exactly for, or if I'm trying to.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.560
And, but I do know one thing that when people say, well, I can't find these kinds of people I'm

48:46.560 --> 48:49.600
looking for. I'm like, you're just not looking in the right places. You have to open up. You

48:49.600 --> 48:54.240
got to really open up new pools. Yeah. You have to think like everybody, you don't have to have a

48:54.240 --> 48:59.120
PhD just like you said. Yeah. I'm sorry to say it. I know it's very valuable, but you have, trust me.

49:00.480 --> 49:08.160
Just like you said, it could even be a negative. So you mentioned like for good power, you are a CEO,

49:08.960 --> 49:13.760
for a long time of a public company. Were there times when there was pressure to sacrifice

49:15.040 --> 49:21.040
what is good for the world for the bottom line in order to do what's good for the company?

49:21.040 --> 49:25.680
There were a lot of times for that. I mean, I think every company faces that today in that

49:27.200 --> 49:30.560
I always felt like there's so much discussion about stakeholder capitalism, right?

49:30.560 --> 49:35.440
Do you just serve a shareholder or do you have multiple? I have always found, and I've been very

49:35.440 --> 49:40.480
vocal about that topic, that when I participated in the Business Roundtable, wrote up a new purpose

49:40.480 --> 49:45.200
statement that had multiple stakeholders. I think it's common sense. Like if you're going to be 100

49:45.200 --> 49:50.000
years old, you only get there because you actually do at some time balance all these different

49:50.000 --> 49:54.320
stakeholders in what it is that you do and short term, long term, all these trade-offs.

49:54.960 --> 49:58.960
And I always say people who write about it, they write about it black and white, but I have to live

49:58.960 --> 50:03.520
in a gray world. Nothing I've ever done has been in a black and white world, hardly. Maybe things

50:03.520 --> 50:09.920
of values that I had to answer, but most of it is gray. And so I think back lots of different

50:09.920 --> 50:16.400
decisions. I think back, as you would well remember, you're a student of history. IBM was one of the,

50:16.400 --> 50:20.720
really the originators of the semiconductor industry and certainly of commercializing the

50:20.720 --> 50:28.640
semiconductor industry. Great R&D and manufacturing, but it is a game of volume. And so when I came on,

50:29.200 --> 50:35.440
we were still manufacturing R&D and manufacturing our own chips. We were losing a lot of money,

50:35.440 --> 50:41.200
yet here we had to fight a war on cloud and AI. And so, okay, now shareholders would say,

50:41.200 --> 50:46.320
fine, shut it down. Okay, those chips also power some of the most important systems that power

50:46.320 --> 50:52.480
these, the banks of today. If I just shut it down, well, what would that do? And so, okay,

50:52.480 --> 50:57.200
the answer wasn't just stop it. The answer wasn't just keep putting money into it.

50:57.760 --> 51:02.080
The answer wasn't, we had to kind of sit in an uncomfortable spot till we found a way. I mean,

51:02.080 --> 51:08.080
it's going to sound so basic, but you as an engineer understand it. We had to separate,

51:08.080 --> 51:11.840
it was a very integrated process of research, development and manufacturing. And you'd also,

51:11.840 --> 51:16.640
you'd be perfecting things in manufacturing. And these were very high performance chips.

51:17.760 --> 51:21.520
We had to be able to separate those. We eventually found a way to do that so that we could

51:22.480 --> 51:28.080
take the manufacturing elsewhere and we would maintain the R&D. I think it's a great example

51:28.080 --> 51:33.520
of the question you just asked because people would have applauded, others would have been,

51:33.520 --> 51:38.400
this was horrible. Or we had a financial roadmap that had been put in place that said,

51:38.400 --> 51:43.840
I'll make this amount of EPS by this date. There came a time we couldn't honor it because we had

51:43.840 --> 51:49.840
to invest. And so, there's a million of these decisions. I think most people that run firms,

51:49.920 --> 51:54.640
any size firm, they're just one right after another like that. And you're always making

51:54.640 --> 52:00.560
that short and long tension of what am I giving up? Well, what is that partnership like with the

52:00.560 --> 52:09.920
clients? Because you work with gigantic businesses. And what's it like sort of really forming a great

52:09.920 --> 52:14.320
relationship with them, understanding what their needs are, being in service of their needs?

52:14.320 --> 52:22.480
Yeah, very simple. Honor your promises. And that happens over time. I mean, in service of,

52:23.280 --> 52:27.360
which is often why you could work with competitors because if you are really in service of you and

52:27.360 --> 52:32.240
you need something, it takes two of us to do it, that becomes easier to do because I really,

52:32.240 --> 52:38.880
we both care, you get what you needed. And so, I can remember during one of the times I was on

52:38.880 --> 52:47.280
a European trip and at the time, and this is still true about views about technology and national

52:47.280 --> 52:52.160
technology giants and global ones and the pros and the cons and countries want their own national

52:52.160 --> 52:57.360
champions, quite obvious. I mean, if I'm France or Germany, and there was a lot of discussion about

52:57.360 --> 53:02.400
security and data and who was getting access to what. And I can remember being in one of the,

53:02.400 --> 53:07.520
I was with Chancellor Merkel, had met her many times. She's very well prepared, very well prepared

53:07.520 --> 53:12.720
every time, as you would know. And I started to explain all these things about why, how,

53:13.360 --> 53:18.400
you know, how we don't share data, who it belongs to. Our systems never had backdoors,

53:18.400 --> 53:24.720
and she sort of stopped me. Like, you're one of the good guys. Like, stop. Now, that wasn't about

53:24.720 --> 53:30.720
me personally. She's talking about a company that's acted consistent with values for decades, right?

53:30.720 --> 53:37.200
So, to me, how you work with those big kind of clients is you honor your promises. You say

53:37.200 --> 53:41.200
what you do, and you do what you say, and you act with values over a long period of time.

53:41.760 --> 53:46.160
And that, to me, people say we're valued. It is not a fluffy thing. It is not a fluffy thing.

53:49.840 --> 53:53.280
I mean, if I was starting a company now, I'd spend a lot of time on that.

53:53.280 --> 53:58.960
On, you know, why we do what we do and why some things are tolerable and something, you know,

53:58.960 --> 54:03.360
what your fundamental beliefs are. And many people sort of zoom past that stage, right?

54:04.160 --> 54:05.120
It's okay for a while.

54:05.760 --> 54:06.960
And never sacrifice that.

54:07.840 --> 54:10.640
You would never sacrifice that. I don't think you can.

54:10.640 --> 54:16.320
So, there was a lot of pressure when you took over as CEO, and there was 22 consecutive quarters

54:16.320 --> 54:22.080
of revenue decline between 2012 and the summer of 2017. So, it was a stressful time. Maybe not.

54:22.080 --> 54:28.560
Maybe you can correct me on that. So, as a CEO, what was it like going through that time,

54:28.640 --> 54:33.840
with the decisions, the tensions in terms of investing versus making a profit?

54:35.040 --> 54:41.040
I always felt that. That sense of urgency was so high, even if I was calm on the outside,

54:41.040 --> 54:46.880
because you have one of the world's largest pensions. So, so many people depend on you.

54:46.880 --> 54:50.720
You have a huge workforce. They're depending on you. You have clients whose businesses don't run

54:50.720 --> 55:00.080
if you don't perform, etc. And shareholders, of course, right? But I also am really clear,

55:00.080 --> 55:05.280
this was perhaps the largest reinvention IBM ever had to undertake. It had a board that understood

55:05.280 --> 55:10.880
that. In fact, some of the headlines were like, this is existential, right? I mean, nobody gives

55:10.880 --> 55:15.600
you a right to exist forever. And there aren't many techs. You're the student of it. They are

55:15.600 --> 55:21.760
gone. They are all gone. And so, if we didn't reinvent ourselves, we were going to be extinct.

55:21.760 --> 55:27.600
And so, now, but you're big, and it's like changing, what's that old saying? Can I change

55:28.720 --> 55:32.240
the wheels while the train's running or something like that, or the engines while the plane's flying?

55:32.960 --> 55:37.680
And that's what you have to do. And that took time. And so, you know, Lex, do I wish it would

55:37.680 --> 55:43.760
have been faster? Absolutely. But the team worked so hard. And in that time frame,

55:44.480 --> 55:53.200
50% of the portfolio was changed. It's a very large company. And if you would also divest it,

55:53.200 --> 55:57.680
$10 billion of businesses. So, if you would look at that growth rate without divestitures and

55:57.680 --> 56:02.080
currency, which now today everyone talks about currency. Back then, we were the only international

56:02.080 --> 56:10.000
guy. Net of divestitures and currency, the growth was flat. Is flat great? No. But flat for a big

56:10.000 --> 56:14.480
transformation, I was really proud of the team for what they did. That is actually pretty

56:14.480 --> 56:19.440
miraculous to have made it through that. I had my little nephew one day and he would see on TV

56:19.440 --> 56:24.640
occasionally when there'd be criticism. And he'd say, you know, Auntie, does that make you mad when

56:24.640 --> 56:29.440
they talk mean? And I just looked at him and I said, you know, he says, how do you feel? I said,

56:29.440 --> 56:36.080
look, I'm doing what has to be done. And I happened to be the one there. And if you have great

56:36.080 --> 56:42.560
conviction, and I did, a great conviction, I knew it was the right thing. I knew it would be needed

56:42.560 --> 56:47.840
for IBM to live its second century. And so, and my successor, they have picked up, gone forward. I

56:47.840 --> 56:52.640
mean, you go back, we did the acquisition of Red Hat. I mean, we had to find our way on cloud,

56:52.640 --> 56:57.840
right? We were late to it. So, we had to find our way. And eventually that led us to hybrid cloud.

56:58.880 --> 57:03.440
We did a lot of work with Red Hat back in 2017. Oh, we'd always done a lot of work with them.

57:03.440 --> 57:09.360
Actually, we were one of the first investors when they were first formed. But that was 2018.

57:09.360 --> 57:12.960
You know, we took quite a hit for even, you know, oh, it was the largest to then

57:12.960 --> 57:18.400
software acquisition ever. But it is the foundation, right, of what is our hybrid

57:18.400 --> 57:23.760
cloud play today and doing very, very well. So, but I had to take a short term hit for that,

57:23.760 --> 57:28.960
right? Short term hit for a very large $34 billion acquisition. But it was for all of us,

57:28.960 --> 57:32.880
it was the right thing to do. So, I think when you get really centered on, you know,

57:32.880 --> 57:36.880
what's the right thing to do, you just keep going, right? So, the team had the vision,

57:36.880 --> 57:40.000
they had the belief and everything else, the criticism doesn't matter. So, don't,

57:40.000 --> 57:45.120
we didn't always have exactly the right, you know, this wasn't a straight arrow, but stay down,

57:45.120 --> 57:48.880
you know, you're right, keep going. Okay, made a mistake. You know, there's no bad mistake as long

57:48.880 --> 57:53.600
as you learn from it, right? And keep moving. So, yes, did it take longer, but we are the largest

57:53.600 --> 57:58.080
that was there. Could you maybe just on a small tangent, educate me a little bit? So,

57:58.160 --> 58:02.720
Red Hat originally is Linux, open source distribution of Linux, but it's also consulting.

58:04.240 --> 58:08.000
Little bit of consulting, but it's mostly software district. It's mostly Linux. It was mostly

58:08.000 --> 58:14.480
software. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So, but today, IBM is very much this, you know,

58:14.480 --> 58:22.560
most IT services in the world is done by IBM. There's so many varied, so basically if you have

58:22.560 --> 58:29.040
issues, problems to solve in business, in the software space, IBM can help.

58:29.040 --> 58:35.600
Yes. And so in that, my last year, our services business, we broke it into two pieces and one

58:35.600 --> 58:41.120
piece was spun off into a company called Kindle, which is managed outsourcing, keeping things

58:41.120 --> 58:46.480
running and they're off creating their own company. What IBM then retained is really the part I built

58:46.480 --> 58:53.760
with PWCC, the big consulting arm. And so today, the IBM of today in 2023 is, you know, at least

58:53.760 --> 59:01.360
ending 2022 was 30% consulting and the other 70% would be what would you consider software cloud AI.

59:01.360 --> 59:06.000
So hybrid cloud and AI is the other and some hardware, obviously still the mainframe is

59:06.000 --> 59:12.480
modernized, alive and kicking and still running some of the most important things of every bank

59:12.480 --> 59:21.200
you can think of practically in the world. And so that is the IBM of today versus perhaps,

59:21.200 --> 59:25.920
you know, and Red Hat is a big piece and an important part of that software portfolio.

59:25.920 --> 59:29.840
And they had some services with them for implementation, but it wasn't a very large

59:29.840 --> 59:35.760
part. And it's grown by leaps and bounds, you know, because originally the belief was everything was

59:35.760 --> 59:42.000
going to go to the public cloud. And at least many people thought that way. We didn't.

59:42.560 --> 59:47.840
In fact, we tried, we cured a public cloud company, we really tried to work it. But what we found was

59:47.840 --> 59:52.960
a lot of the mission critical work, it was tuned for consumer world, it wasn't tuned for the

59:52.960 --> 01:00:00.880
enterprise. So then time is elapsing here though, and you got to be of scale. And we didn't have any

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.840
application, remember, we're not an application company. So it wasn't like we had an office,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.960
we didn't have anything that like pulled things out to the cloud. And so as we look for what our

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:15.680
best, what we really back to who you are, we really know mission critical work, we know where

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.480
it lives today, and we know how to make it live on the cloud, which led us down hybrid cloud,

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:25.440
you know, that belief that the real world would turn into, there'll be things on traditional that

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:30.400
you'll never move because it doesn't make sense. There'll be private clouds for, you know, have

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.480
all the benefit of the cloud, but they just don't have, you know, infinite expansion. And then

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.560
there'll be public clouds, and you're going to have to connect them and be secure. And that's

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.560
what took us down the path with Red Hat, that belief. The structure of that is fundamentally

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.960
different than something that's consumer facing. So the lesson you learn there is you can't just

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:51.120
reuse something that's optimized for consumers. Very interesting point. It doesn't mean consumer

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:55.200
companies can't move up in the enterprise because obviously they have, right? But I think it's very

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.680
hard to take something from the enterprise and come on down. Because it got to be simple,

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.520
consumable, all the things we talked about already. Plus you have to have the relationships with

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:07.040
the enterprise. Yeah, very different. Yeah. I mean, you know our history, right? At one time,

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.560
we had the PC business. And, you know, the short answer to why would we not do that is

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.400
it's a consumer facing business. We were good at the enterprise. And that consumer business,

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.760
A, highly competitive, got to be low cost. All the things that are not the same muscles,

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:28.000
necessarily, of being in an innovation driven, you know, technology business.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.880
Yeah. But what is now Lenovo? I guess that's what's just been told.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.520
That's right. Lenovo acquired it.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:37.360
You're extremely good at that. So, but not as good as you're saying as an enterprise.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.200
Lenovo's very good at their PC world, yes. And they can sell into the enterprise, right?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.240
But you as a consumer can go buy a Lenovo too. So look in China, right? Look in other places. So

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.560
that's what I mean by consumer, you know, an end device. And that was a big decision because it

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.480
would have been one of the last things that had our logo on it that sits in your hands, right? So

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.560
when a new generation says, well, what does IBM do, right? Was that a difficult decision?

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.240
Do you remember? This is a long time ago now. It's like 2005.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:11.760
So they're all difficult because it's not only things as people, but it's back to knowing who

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:18.240
you are is how I would sum that up as, right? And we were never great at making a lot of money at

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.960
that. And you can remember, originally it was IBM PC, then there were IBM clones. They weren't

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:28.960
called IBM clones back then as the field became highly, highly competitive. And as things

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.880
commoditized, we often, as they commoditize, we would move them out and move on to the next

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:41.200
innovation level. But because of that, it's not as public facing, even though it's one of the most

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:47.200
recognizable logos ever. Yeah. Isn't it true? That is very true. That is actually a very important

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:53.040
point. And that is, you know, branding, as you say, one of the most recognizable in a very highly

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:59.760
ranked brand strength around the world. And so that's a trade-off. I mean, I can't, you know,

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.120
because there was a time you'd have something of IBM in your home or a cash register. As an

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.520
example, you'd walk into a store. Actually, they're still in places that went to Toshiba.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.600
Can you speak to consulting a little bit? What does that entail to train up to hire a workforce

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:20.640
that can be of service to all kinds of different problems in the software space, in the tech space?

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.240
What's entailed in that? I mean, you have to value a different set of things, right? And so

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:32.240
you've got to always stay ahead. It's about hiring people who are willing to learn. It is about,

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.760
at the same time, in my view, it's what really drives you to be customer centric.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:48.080
Maybe you can educate me. I think consulting is a kind of, you roll in and you try to solve problems

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:53.680
that businesses have, like with expertise, right? Okay. Is that the process of consulting?

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.600
Somewhat, right? Okay, so fair enough. When you say that we're consulting,

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:01.760
it's a really broad spectrum. I mean, I think people could be sitting here thinking it does any,

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:07.120
it could be, I just give advice and I leave, to all the way to I run your systems, right? And I

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:14.320
think it's generally, people use the word to cover everything in that space. So we sort of fit in the

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.040
spot, which is we would come in and live at that intersection of business and technology. So yeah,

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.240
we could give you recommendations and then we'd implement them and see them through because we

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.560
had the technology to go to the implementation and see them through. And at the time back then,

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:31.360
that's what, there'd been five of those that had failed. The companies had bought other consulting

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:37.120
firms. And so we were, okay, that was the great thing about, I mean, the harrowing thing about it

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:41.600
was here, please go work on this. None of the others have ever succeeded before. And yet,

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.920
on the other hand, the great promise was you could really, clients were dying at that time

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.240
when we were doing that to get more value out of their technology and have it really change the

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.960
way the business worked. So I think of it as how to improve business and apply technology and see it

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.320
all the way through. That's what we do today still. Yeah. To see it all the way through.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:03.680
Yeah. Yes. So let me say almost like a personal question. So that was a big thing you were a

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:10.080
part of that you led in 2002, that you championed and helped, I should say, negotiate the purchase

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:18.480
of one day, the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion. So what were some of the

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:27.280
challenges of that that you remember? Personal and business. At that time, PW really had to divest.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:33.040
And so they were in parallel going to IPO, right? So we sort of swept in at that point and said,

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:38.400
and we'd been thinking about it a long time and started to work on that as an acquisition. So,

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.120
you know, kind of balancing which way would they go IPO or acquisition? And so the challenges are

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:47.760
obvious. And part of it's why they went with us as an acquisition. Big difference to be a private

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.320
firm than a public firm. Very big. I can remember one of the guys, you know, he asked somebody,

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:56.720
how long you've been with IBM? And the person answered 143 quarters. Okay, that's a little

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:03.440
enlightening about a business model, right? So we had the challenges of being private versus public.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:07.120
You have the challenge of when you acquire something like that, as I say, you acquire hearts,

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.720
not parts. They could leave. I mean, you could destroy your value by them leaving.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:17.280
They can walk right out the door. I mean, yes, you can put, you know, lots of restraints, but still

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.880
that you have there. And then we had to really build a new business model that people and clients

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:28.400
would, you know, see as valuable and be willing to pay for. And so we had to do something that

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:33.600
lived at that intersection and say that how this was unique is what we were doing. So you had the

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.480
people aspect, you had that they were going to be private and they had public and they had

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:44.000
always been private their whole life. And, and then you had the business model. So in the others,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:50.320
it all failed that had tried to do this. So yeah, it was a, it was, it was a tough thing to do.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.120
What about the personal side of that? That was a big leap step up for you. You've been IBM for a

01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:03.520
long time. This is, this is a big sort of leadership, uh, like very impactful,

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.040
large scale leadership decisions. What was that like?

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:12.480
So, you know, unlike in my career earlier where I said I was changing jobs, I said I wasn't

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:19.040
comfortable, et cetera. So now here fast forward 10 years and I'm like, okay, honestly, how I felt

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.400
inside on one hand, I did what I learned, like inventory, which you know how to do. Like you

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.680
have some good strengths that could work here. The other part of me said, boy, this is a really

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.800
high profile. And I felt, and I can remember saying to someone like, this is going to kill me

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:40.960
or catapult, probably nothing in between. And that wasn't terrifying to you. That was okay.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.320
You're okay with that? I was okay with that because I felt I knew enough, you know, like these things

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.000
I had, and I'll tell you the one thing I felt I knew the best, um,

01:07:53.120 --> 01:08:00.160
consultants of any worth their weight, they really do care that they deliver for an end client.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.680
And, and I felt I understood service to a client so well that what it meant to really provide value.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:13.120
So I knew we would have like something that I knew the PWC people more than anything wanted

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.840
to deliver value to those clients they had next to then developing their people that those were

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.640
like the really two things and that I could, and I also knew they felt they could do better if they

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.440
had more technology and we did. So, so there really was a reason, you know, that I could really

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:32.720
believe in. So I authentically believed back to that point. And I also felt I had built some of

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:40.080
those skills to be able to do that. But I want to call it terrifying, but, but make no mistake,

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:47.040
like it was very hard and it was, it turned out to be extremely successful. By the time we ended,

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.960
it was worth 19 and a half, one time I stepped, I ran it for, oh, goodness gracious, quite a long

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:59.440
time. I'm going to say seven or eight, nine years and we were 19 and a half billion dollars. It made

01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:05.600
2.7 billion in profit. It was very consequential to IBM, but the fact that it was consequential

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:10.560
is also very, I mean, there was a time as we moved through it, I can even remember it.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.000
We just weren't meeting the goals as fast as we should. And some of it was clients were like, oh,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.360
now you're IBM. So it means some things I knew would happen, but they happen so much faster.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.880
It'd be things like clients would say, oh, IBM cares about a quarter. So let's negotiate every

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.640
quarter on these prices. And, you know, when they were private, they didn't have these issues. Well,

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:39.200
that had an impact on margins really fast. And so you pick them up right away. And I thought, oh,

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:44.640
boy, I mean, if I don't get this turned around, this is really a problem. And the team learned a

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:48.160
lot of lessons. I mean, I learned people I had to move out, that I learned that when people

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:54.480
don't believe they can do something, they probably won't do it. So, you know, we wanted to run the

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:58.880
business at a certain level. I really did have some great leaders, but they didn't really believe

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.840
it could do that. And I finally had to come to terms with, if you don't really believe in

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.920
something, you really aren't going to probably make it happen at the end of the day. And so

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.360
we would change that. We would have to actually get some more help to help us on doing so.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:16.640
But then it turned. And I can remember the day that we started really getting the business to hum

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.800
and start to, it was almost like, finally! And I gave the team this little plaque, this little kind

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.800
of corny paperweight thing. And I'm going to believe, I remember it was Thomas Edison,

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:35.440
and he said, many of life's greatest failures are people who gave up right before they were

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:42.080
going to be successful. And it's so true. I mean, there was also a governor of Texas

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:47.200
who's passed, but she had said, someone said, what's the secret of your success? And she said,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.640
it's passion and perseverance when everyone else would have given up. And I feel that's

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.600
what that taught me. That taught me like, no, no matter how bad this gets, you are not giving up.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.280
And now you can't keep doing the same thing like the, you know, doctor, this hurts. Oh,

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.720
then stop doing it. You can't keep doing the same thing. We had to keep changing till we found our

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.600
right way to get the model to work right. And client work, we never, never had an issue and

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:20.400
kept so many of the people. And now we are 25 years almost later. And a number of them

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.400
run parts of the IBM business still today. So it's that old Maya Angelou saying when you say,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.800
what do I remember? They'll say, you won't remember the specifics of this, but you'll

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.640
remember how you felt. And that's kind of how I feel. And I think they do too, the whole team

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.560
does of that. Like I'll get anniversary notes still on that, you know, when you've been through

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:45.360
something like that together with people. So during the acquisition, the way you knew the people,

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.080
it's the right team are the ones that could believe that this consulting business can grow,

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.320
can integrate with IBM and all of that. Yeah, I was lucky. Look, I did things that

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.640
helped that. I mean, I knew that people joining us would feel more comfortable if they had people

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:06.400
leading it that they recognized, et cetera. But again, I learned those that didn't then,

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:11.680
I eventually had to take, you know, some action out. But PWCC had a lot of really dedicated

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.360
leaders to it. And I give them a lot of credit. Well, it's amazing to see a thing that kind of

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:23.840
start at that very stressful time and then it turns out to be a success. That's just beautiful

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.960
to see. So what about the acquisition itself? Is there something interesting to say about the,

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.440
like, what you learned about maybe negotiation? Because there's a lot of money involved too.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:39.280
To me, it was a win-win. And we both actually cared that customers got value. So there was

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:45.360
this, like, third thing that had a benefit, not them. There was this third thing. And then next

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:50.560
to that- I like how you think that people would have the wisdom of what it takes to have great

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.720
negotiation. But yeah, so it's a win-win is one of the ways you can have successful negotiation.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.320
But it's like obvious to even say that, right? I mean, if you can, back to being in service

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:04.080
of something, we were both in service of clients. So in and then, you know, I always say,

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.760
when you have a negotiation with someone, okay, both parties always kind of walk away a little

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.080
bit. Okay, that's good. If they both walk away going, yeah, I should have got a little bit more.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:19.280
Okay, but it's okay. Okay, they're both a little fussy. When one walks away and thinks they did

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.240
great and the other one did horrible, they usually is like born bad. I mean, because they never work

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:30.720
that way. And I've always felt that way with negotiations that you push too far down. You

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:38.000
will usually be sorry you did that, you know? So don't push too far. I mean, that's ultimately

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.000
what collaboration and empathy means is you're interested in the long-term success of everybody

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.600
together versus like your short-term success. And then you get the discretionary energy from

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.760
them versus like, okay, you screwed me here. I'm done, right? So let's even rewind even back.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:59.760
Oh, no. Oh, no. Do you feel like this is a nostalgia interview? Oh, no.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.600
Let me just ask the romantic question. What did you love most about engineering, computer science,

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.320
electrical engineering, so in those early days from your degree to the early work?

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.760
I love that logic part of it, right? And you do get a sense of completion at some point when

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:20.080
you reach certain milestones that, you know, like, yes, it worked or yes, that finite answer to that.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.200
So that's what I loved about it. I loved the problem solving of it.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.040
Computing, what led you down that path with computing in general? What made you fall in

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:32.480
love with computing, with engineering? It's probably that back to that desire,

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.160
wanting to know how things work, right? And so that's like a natural thing. You know,

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.760
math, I loved math for that reason. I always wanted to study how did that, you know,

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:45.200
how did it get that to work kind of thing. So it goes back in that time. But I did start,

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:48.400
when I went to when I started at Northwestern, I wasn't, I was already in the engineering school,

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.160
but my first thought was to be a doctor, that that was far more noble, that I should be a medical

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.680
doctor until I could not pass human reproduction as a course. And I thought the irony that I could

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.840
not, I'm like, I got all these colored pencils, I got to make these pictures, this is not working

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:05.600
out for me. I'm going to stick to math. It was the only course in my four-year college

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:10.160
education I had to take pass fail, because otherwise I risked, you know, impairing my

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:16.720
grade point average. Engineering it is. So, but after about 10 years, you jumped from the technical

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.960
role of systems engineer to a management, to a leadership role. Did you miss at that time the

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:27.920
sort of the technical direct contribution versus being a leader, a manager? That's an interesting

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.440
point. Like I said, I've always been sort of a doer leader, you know, so. So you never lost it?

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.640
I never really did. Even, you know, and I think this is like really important for today.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.160
The best way people learn is experientially, I think. You may, that's being a generalization,

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.040
because there are people can learn all different ways, right? So I've done things like with my

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:55.520
whole team. They all had to learn how to build cloud applications and call it code off. And so,

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:01.920
you know, I don't care what your job is, write code, you know? And I remember when we were

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.720
trying to get the company to understand AI, we did something called a cognitive jam. Okay,

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.480
there's a reason we picked the word cognitive, by the way, instead of AI. Today we use the word AI.

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:17.920
It was really symbolic. It was to mean this is to help you think, not replace your thinking.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.720
There was so much in the zeitgeist about AI being a bad thing at that time. So that was why we

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.520
picked a mouthful of a word like cognitive. And it was like, no, no, this is to help you, actually.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:32.720
So do what, you know, do what you do better or do something you haven't yet learned. And we did

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.640
something called the cognitive jam. But the whole point was everybody in the company could volunteer,

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.360
get on a team. You either had to build something that improved one of our products or did something

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:48.240
for a client or did a social, solved a social issue with AI. And again, this goes back now,

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.280
10 years, and people did things from bullying applications to, you know, railroad stuff,

01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:02.240
to whatever it was. But it got like 100,000 people to understand, you know, viscerally what is AI.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.720
So that's a long answer to my belief around experiential. And so do you ever give it up?

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.960
I don't think so, because I actually think that's pretty good to get your hands dirty

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.640
in something. You know, you can't do it, you know, depending what you're doing, your

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:20.720
effort to do that will be less. So even a CEO, you try to get your hands dirty a little bit.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:25.200
I've played, I mean, still, I'm not saying I'm any good at any of it, you know, anymore.

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:29.280
But to build up intuition. Yeah, it's that really understand,

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:34.560
right? And not be afraid of. Yeah. Like we mentioned at the beginning, IBM research has

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:39.600
helped catalyze some of the biggest accomplishments in computing and artificial intelligence history.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:49.840
So D Blue, IBM D Blue versus Kasparov chess match in 96 and 97. Just to ask, kind of like what your

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.760
perception is, what your memory is of it, what is that moment? Like this seminal moment, I believe

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.280
probably one of the greatest moments in AI history when the machine first beat a human at a thing

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.840
that humans do. You make a very interesting point because it is like one of the first

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.000
demonstrations of using a game to like bring something to people's consciousness, right?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And to this day, people use games right to demonstrate different things. But at the time,

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:22.400
it's funny. I didn't necessarily think of it so much as AI. And I'll tell you why. I was and I'm

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:27.200
not a chess player. You might be a chess player, so I'm not expert at it. But I think I understand

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.920
properly of chess that chess has got a finite number of moves that can be made. Therefore,

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.560
if it's finite, really what's a demonstration of a supercomputing, right? It's about the amount

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.600
of time and how fast it can crunch through to find the right move. So in some ways, I thought of it

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.600
as almost a bigger demonstration of that. But it is absolutely as you said, it is was a motivator,

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.120
one of the big milestones of AI. Because it put in your consciousness that it's man

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.880
in this other machine, right? Doing something. So you saw it as just a challenging

01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.200
competition problem. And this is a way to demonstrate hardware and software computation

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:08.240
at its best. Yes, I did. But the thing is, there is a romantic notion that chess is the embodiment

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.360
of human intellect. I mean, intelligence, that you can't build a machine that can beat a chess

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:19.280
champion in chess. And I was blessed by not being a chess expert. So it's just a computation

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.520
problem. It's a computation problem to me. Well, that's probably required to not be paralyzed by

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:31.680
the immensity of the task. So that this is just solvable. But it was a very, very, I think that

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:39.520
was a powerful moment. So speaking just as an AI person, that was that reinvigorated the dream.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.280
You were a little kid back then though, right? In 95. You had to be like, were you remember it

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.880
actually at the moment? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What did you think at the moment about it?

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:59.040
It was awe inspiring, because especially sort of growing up in the Soviet Union,

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:06.880
you think especially of Garry Kasparov and chess, like your intuition is weak about those things.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:14.480
I didn't see it as computation. I thought of it as intelligence, because chess for a human being

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:22.320
doesn't feel like computation. It feels like some complicated relationship between memory and

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:29.120
patterns and intuition and guts and instinct and all of those. If you watch someone play,

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.560
that's what you would conclude, right? So to see a machine be able to

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:39.280
be a human. I mean, you get a little bit of that with Chad GPT now. It's like language was to us

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:46.640
humans, the thing that we kind of surely, the poetry of language is something only humans can

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:53.120
really have. It's going to be very difficult to replicate the magic of the natural language

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:59.040
without deeply understanding language. But it seems like Chad GPT can do some incredible things

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:07.840
with language and in natural language dialogue. But that was the first moment in AI. Through all

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:13.840
the AI winters from the 60s is the promise of the, it was, wow, this is possible for

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.160
a simple set of algorithms to accomplish something that we think of as intelligence.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.440
So that was truly inspiring that maybe intelligence, maybe the human mind is just algorithms.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:31.600
That was the thought at the time. And of course, now the funny thing what happens is the moment

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:35.280
you accomplish it, everyone says, oh, it's just brute force algorithms. It's silly.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:42.800
And this continues every single time you pass a benchmark, a threshold to win a game. People

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.040
say, oh, well, it's just this. It's just this. It's just this. And that, I think that's funny.

01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:54.480
And there's going to be a moment when we're going to have to contend with AI systems that

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:02.720
exhibit human-like emotions and feelings. And you have to start to have some difficult discussions

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:07.760
about, well, how do we treat those beings and what role do they have in society? What are the

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.040
rules around that? And this is really exciting because that also puts a mirror to ourselves

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:18.960
to see, okay, what's the right way to treat each other as human beings? Because it's a good test

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:25.200
for that. It is because I always say it's a reflection of humanity. I mean, it's taught by

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:31.760
bad stuff in the past. You'll teach it bad stuff for the future, which is why I think efforts to

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:37.360
regulate it are a fool's errand. You need to regulate uses because it's not the technology

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.640
itself is not inherently good or bad, but how it's used or taught can be good or bad for sure.

01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:49.120
And so that's, to me, will unveil now a whole different way of having to look at technology.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.560
What about another magical leap with the early days of Watson with beating the Jeopardy Challenge?

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.840
What was your experience like with Watson and what's your vision for Watson in general?

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.080
And it was really inspired by first chess, right, and Kasparov, and then you come forward in time.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:11.120
And I think what Watson did, because you used a really important word, AI had kind of waxed and

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.560
waned in these winners, right? In and out, in and out, popular not, more money, less money,

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.920
in and out, confidence, no confidence. And so I think that was one of the first times it brought

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:27.760
to the forefront of people like, whoa, like it humanized it, because here it is playing against

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.080
these two gentlemen. And as you did lose it first, you know, and then finally, finally won at the end

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.680
of the day. And but what it was doing is making you say, hey, natural language, it's actually

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.680
understanding natural language is one of the first demonstrations of natural language support,

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:50.320
and bit of reasoning over lots of data, right? And so that it could have access to a lot of things,

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:55.840
come up with a conclusion on it. And to me, that was a really big moment. And I do think it brought

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:00.000
to the conscious of the public, and in good ways and bad, because it probably set expectations very

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.880
high of like, whoa, what this could be. But and I still do believe that it has got the ability

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.000
to change and help us man, make better decisions, that so many decisions are not optimal in this

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.040
world, you know, even medical decisions. And it's right or wrong, what took us down a path

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.080
of healthcare first with our AI. And and we took many pivots. And I think there's a really

01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:28.800
valuable lesson in what we learned. One is that I actually don't think the challenges are the

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.760
technology. Yes, those are challenges. But the challenges are the people are the people challenges

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:42.080
around this, right? So do people trust it? How will they use it? I mean, I saw that straight up

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.960
with the doctors and like, meaning they're so busy in the way they've been taught to do something.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.760
Do they really have time to learn another way? I saw it was a mistake when you put it on top

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:56.720
of processes that didn't change, kind of like paving a cow path, didn't work. I mean, it was

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:03.120
all human change management around it that were really its biggest challenges. And another valuable

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:07.920
lesson we picked back to you said you think of IBM as moonshots, we picked really hard problems

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:14.720
to start with. I think you see a lot of technology now starts with really simple problems. And in by

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:18.720
that, it probably starts to build trust because I start little, it's like, oh, I'm not ready to,

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:23.360
you know, outsource my diagnosis to you, but I'll get some information here about a test question.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.640
So very different thinking. So a lot of things to learn, we were making a market at the time.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:33.520
And when you make a market, you know, choice of problem you work on gets to be very important

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:39.200
when you're catching up. Well, then it's a scale game. So very different thing. And so but Watson

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:47.200
proved, I think, I mean, I hope I'm not being too, I think Watson brought AI back out of winter for

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.120
the world. And that since then, there's just been, you know, one company after another and innovations

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:56.400
and people working on it. And I have no regrets of anything that we did, we learned so much,

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.040
and we probably rebuilt it many times over, it made it more modular. And today, to IBM,

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.080
Watson is more about AI inside a lot of things, if you think of it that way, which is more like

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.840
an ingredient versus it's a thing in and of itself. And I think that's how it'll bring its

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.080
real value, you know, more as an ingredient, and it's so badly needed. And even back then,

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:20.000
the issue was so much data, like, what do you ever do it, you can't get through it,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.040
you can't use it for anything, you know, this, well, it's your profession. So

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:28.160
we have to have it. So that's, that's going to propel it forward.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.360
So it's part of the suite of tools that you use when you go to enterprise and you try to solve

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.480
different problems. Yeah, so AI for security, AI in automated operations, AI in your robotics,

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.920
AI on your factory, you know, I mean, it's, it's all part of and I think, and that's why even to

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:48.000
this day, thousands, I mean, thousands and thousands of clients of IBM still have the

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.040
Watson components that it's the AI being used. So it became a platform is how I would say it, right?

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:59.520
And an ingredient that went inside and consultants, like you said, had to learn,

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:06.320
I had, they had to learn, don't just put it on something, you got to rethink how that thing

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.760
should work, because with the AI, it could work entirely differently. And so I also felt it could

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:17.280
open up and still will open up jobs to a lot of people, because more like an assistant, and it

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.080
could help me be qualified to do something. And we even years ago saw this with the French banks,

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:28.080
very unionized, but that idea that you could, in this case, the unions voted for it, because

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.200
it felt people did a better job. And so, and that's just part about being really dedicated

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.680
to help it help humanity, not destroy it. Speaking of which, a funny side note. So Kubrick's

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:48.800
2000 Space Odyssey. What do you think about, you know, the fact that HAL 9000 was named after IBM?

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.160
I really don't think it was. I know, I really don't, I've often-

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.040
It could be more fake news. It's more fake news. I have done,

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.480
I've like researched this, tried to find any evidence and people have talked to, you know,

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.760
was it really, you know, one letter, it was one letter off, right?

01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.760
People don't know H is one letter off of I, A is one letter off of B, and then L is one letter off of-

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.880
That was the, I think that's a solution found afterwards, you know. But here's what I think

01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:18.560
it more was. I do think it's one of the early demonstrations of evil AI, like can be taught bad.

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:24.560
I could push back on that, because it's presented as evil in the movie, because it hurts, the AI

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.000
hurts people. But it's a really interesting ethical question, because the role of HAL 9000

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:37.360
is to carry out a successful mission. And so the question that is a human question,

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:45.360
it's not an AI question, at what price? Humans wage war, they pay very heavy costs for

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.800
a vision, for a goal of a future that creates a better world. And so that's the question,

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.440
certainly in space. Doctors ask that question all the time, my delimited resources could allocate

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:01.440
my time and money and efforts. I agree. Like I said, I've spent a decade talking about this

01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:06.640
question of AI ethics, right? And that it needs really considerable, not just attention,

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:13.120
because otherwise it will mirror everything we love and everything we don't love. And again,

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:16.000
and that's the beauty in the eye of the beholder, right? Depending on your culture and everything

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.520
else, with what you're doing and what you're going to do, how do you think about it? Do you think

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:27.280
about the AI you're going to develop as having guardrails dictated by some of your beliefs?

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.840
Yeah, for sure. So there's so many interesting ways to do this the right way. And I don't think

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:39.600
anyone has an answer. I tend to believe that transparency is really important. So I think

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:46.160
some aspect of your work should be open sourced, or at least have an open source competitor that

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:53.360
creates kind of forcing function for transparency of how you do things. So the other is I tend to

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.800
believe maybe it's because of the podcast and I've just talked to a lot of people,

01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:03.520
you should know the people involved. I agree 100%. As opposed to hide behind a company while

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:08.000
sometimes there's a pressure, you have a PR team and you have to care for investors and discussions

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.440
and so on. Let's protect, let's surely not tweet. And you form this bubble where you have incredible

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:22.560
engineers doing fascinating work and also doing work that's difficult, complex human questions

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:27.360
being answered. And we don't know about any of them as a society. And so we can't really have

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:32.720
that conversation. Even though that conversation would be great for hiring, it would be great for

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:37.200
revealing the complexities of what the company is facing. So when the company makes mistakes,

01:30:37.200 --> 01:30:43.200
you understand that it wasn't malevolence or half-assetness in the decision-making,

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.280
it's just a really hard problem. And so I think transparency is just good for everybody.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:55.440
And I mean, in general, just having a lot of public conversations about this is serious stuff.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.320
That AI will have a transformative impact on our society and it might do so very,

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.360
very quickly through all kinds of ways we're not expecting, which is social media recommendation

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:13.360
systems. They at scale have impact on the way we think, on the way we consume news and

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.800
our growth, like the kind of stuff we consume to grow and learn and become better human beings,

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:28.080
all of that. That's all AI. And then obviously the tools that run companies on which we depend,

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.960
the infrastructure on which we depend, we need to know all about those AI decisions. And it's

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.800
not as simple as, well, we don't want the AI to say these specific set of bad things.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:49.600
Unfortunately, I don't believe it's possible to prevent evil or bad things by creating a set of

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:55.520
cold mathematical rules. Unfortunately, it's all fuzzy and gray areas. It's all a giant mess.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:01.360
You think about it like a knife. A knife can do good and a knife can do bad. It's very hard.

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.320
You can't ban knives.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:10.560
You can't ban knives. I think back, it was probably 2015, 16, we did principles of trust

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:15.760
and transparency. Notice the word transparency. That belief that with AI, it should be explainable.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:19.360
You should know who taught it. You should know the data that went into training it.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.160
You should know how it was written. If it's being used, you have a right to know these things.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:29.600
And I think those are pretty, to this day, really powerful principles to be followed.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.680
And part of it, we ended up writing, because here we were, when we were working on particularly

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:41.280
healthcare, like, okay, you care who trained it in what? And that comes to your mind,

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.640
you're like, yeah, that makes a lot of sense for something important like that. But just in general,

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.160
people won't trust the technologies, I don't think, unless they have transparency into those

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:54.080
things. In the end, they won't really trust it. I think a lot of people would like to know,

01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:02.000
sort of, because a lot of us, I certainly do suffer from imposter syndrome, that self-critical

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.240
brain. So taking that big step into leadership, did you at times suffer from imposter syndrome?

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:13.440
Like, how did I get here? Do I really belong here? Or were you able to summon the courage

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:21.760
and sort of the confidence to really step up? I think that's very natural for someone. Like,

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.440
no matter, like the bigger the job gets, you turn and you look to the left and the right,

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.560
and you see people around you and you think, what am I doing here? Right? But then you remember what

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:40.160
you do. And there's no one else doing it. And so you get that confidence. So I do hear a lot of

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:47.520
people talk about imposter syndrome, right? And I kind of, actually, this past year, I've spent

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:57.840
some time helping people on that topic. And you have to believe you have a right to be like anyone

01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:04.160
else does if you've prepared for that moment, you know? And so it's a bit more of a, I know it's

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:08.400
hard to say, like a confidence thing more than anything else. So yes, there are times I look

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:15.040
around, but then I think, wow, I'm in a position to make something change. So I can't say I have ever

01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.120
really dwelled on that feeling for long. Okay. So you just focus on the work. I have an opportunity.

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:24.240
You know, it's good or bad. I just focus on the work. Yeah. Good or bad. Yeah. One important

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:30.240
lesson you said you learned from your mom is never let anyone else define you. Only you define who

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:37.520
you are. So what's the trajectory, let's say, of your self-definition journey of you discovering

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.960
who you are from having that very difficult upbringing?

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.760
You know, they say pivotal moments happen and you don't realize it when they're happening.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:55.520
So I feel like most of my self-discovery, it's been like something happens in a year or two

01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.960
or some number later, I look back on it and say, you know, I learned this from that. It's like not

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:06.240
in the moment always with me. That could just be how I am. So I feel like it's been

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:11.520
know yourself. It's a good thing, right? I've actually heard you say that on different podcasts

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:15.680
when you ask people questions, you're like, well, it depends, you know, like know yourself a bit,

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:20.000
right? And it's hard to know who you are, though. There's a lot of things, like you said, like,

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.880
for me, there's moods when you're super self-critical. Sometimes you're super

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:29.520
confident and there's many. Sometimes you're emotional. Sometimes you're cool under pressure

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.600
and all those are the same human being. Yeah. And I think that's fine.

01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:40.560
That's fine. Self-awareness, that's different. Was there societal expectations and norms

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:47.680
regarding gender that you felt in your career? You've spoken to that a little bit, but was there

01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:55.440
some aspect of that that was constraining, empowering, or both? You know, I chose to never

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:59.760
look at it, okay? Now, whether that is right or wrong, and again, I'm a product of the 70s

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.480
and 70s and the 80s where I think I was surrounded. All the other women around me

01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:09.840
viewed our way to get ahead was just to work hard, work hard, work hard, and that was the way you

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.720
differentiated yourself. And that's obvious, it did help. I mean, there's no doubt about it.

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:18.240
You were always, you know, you learned a lot of things, which qualified, opened up another door,

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:24.640
opened up another door. I'm very mindful that I have worked for companies that are very steeped

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:30.320
in those values of equal opportunity. And so nothing remarkable about that. And I mean,

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:38.400
when I was a wee kid, I'm taught, hire a diverse team. I get evaluated for it. I get evaluated if

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.080
my team has built up their skills. So this is that, you know, when you're really formative,

01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.640
you're in a culture that that's what it's valuing, right? So it becomes part of you. So

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:51.760
I say sometimes to Chagrin, did I ever feel I was held back for that reason?

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.080
No, were there plenty of times when, you know, I write about a few stories in the book, I'm laying

01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.080
cables at night and the guys are at the bar. Now, I didn't really want to go with them to the bar

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.080
anyways. They'd be like, we'll be back to get you, you know, bye. And I'm like, okay.

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.960
I mean, I learned a lot. So it didn't. Now, all that said, back to my earlier story about being

01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.800
a role model, you know, it would be foolish to not believe that there were times that that mattered.

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:25.760
And I would say two things, even not that long ago, you know, a colleague called me and

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:32.160
I was talking about media and about women CEOs and said, do you notice that sometimes when it's

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.560
a woman CEO, they call the person by name. And when it's a man, they call the company out, not

01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.440
the person's name exactly associated with the issue. And I said, yeah, well, I think you have

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:47.120
to just understand much of what you do, it will be magnified because there are so few of you.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.560
And sometimes it will be, you know, really can be blown out of proportion, right? And so

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:59.840
that can happen and you get to learn which in which way. Now, all that said on gender,

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:03.680
it is an interesting thing with the book as I've talked to, you know, having a book.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:08.160
It is one of my best friends. The first reaction is I can't wait for my daughter to read it.

01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:11.920
I say, well, that's interesting. Do you think you could read it?

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:17.120
Oh, that's fascinating. It's an interesting reaction. And here I am 40 years later,

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:21.920
that's an interesting reaction, right? And I say, no, the book, I really worked hard to

01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.920
write it for everyone. I just happened to be a woman, right? But there's still that there.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:33.680
And so look, until I think people see and never feel that they have a, it doesn't even matter

01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.160
whether it's a woman, could be another diverse group that feels it. It's okay to ask those

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.160
questions. And that's why actually I'm okay talking about it, because there were times I

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.640
felt it, right? There were times in my life on my looks or my weight or my clothing or

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.760
endless numbers of things that people would comment on that they would not have commented on

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:59.680
if it was someone else. Now, on the other hand, when there's so few of you, and, you know,

01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:05.520
and there's good and bad. I mean, there's benefit to that too, right? If you do good work,

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:12.560
it's easier to be recognized. And so a pro and a con, and I think I've just, you know, grown up

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.400
believing like my advice to young women, go into engineering, not because you're going to be an

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.000
engineer. It teaches you to solve problems and anything you job you do is going to be solving

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.200
problems. Things like that are what I take away from that in that journey.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.920
It is interesting that, you know, I hear from women

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:36.560
that even on this podcast, when I talk to incredible women like yourself, it is inspiring

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.920
to young women to hear. I mean, you like to see you talk to somebody from Turkey and then Turkish

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:47.440
people all get excited. It's so true. So you get like somebody that looks like you, somebody that

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:54.000
in the category could be tiny or can be, it can be huge. That's just the reality of the world.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.560
It is the reality of the world. And I, the work I do now to put this group called 110,

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:02.400
put 1 million black employees into the middle class without college degrees, get them the right

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:10.240
skills, upwardly mobile jobs. So one of my last years, we had been working on, it just did regular

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:13.920
leadership session at IBM and had our black colleagues were talking about what did it feel

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:19.840
like to be a black leader. And here, these are extremely accomplished people. And I can remember

01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:26.240
very well one telling a story about, look, I felt if I failed or succeeded, it's not just me.

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.480
It came from a country in Africa. I felt like the whole country is on my shoulder,

01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:36.240
my success or failure. That's a burden. I mean, like, I don't feel that burden. Not true. As

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:41.120
woman CEO, I did feel like, you know, even the headlines when I was named said, you know,

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:45.920
her appointment will either, you know, her success or failure will be a statement for the whole gender

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:51.200
kind of thing. And I didn't dwell on it, but I meant that's, but I could see how people,

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:55.440
like you said, it could be a small group, could be whatever. And so that is a lot of pressure on

01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.800
people and they need role models. You are a role model for people. Look at what you're able to do.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:02.960
You do these podcasts, you understand your science very well. You're very well prepared,

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.240
your ability to translate it to people. You know, that's not an insignificant thing. And you may

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:13.040
think, oh, you know, is that about the power of me? Not really, right? And you obviously believe

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.040
you don't do this because you just like sitting at a microphone. You do it because you think,

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.160
okay, if I can get people to say things that are really valuable to other people,

01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:24.720
they're going to learn something. I assume that is, I mean, you ever told me my interpretation is

01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:29.040
that's why you do this podcast, that you feel like in service of other people, that

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.920
you can bring them something unique by the way you do this. Now I should ask you, why do you do it?

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.440
That's my impression. By the way, can I just comment on the fact that you keep asking me

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:48.000
really hard questions? I'm really honored by it. As a fan of a podcast myself,

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:55.920
what I hope is to talk to people like you and to show that you are a fascinating and beautiful

01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:02.480
human being outside of your actual accomplishments also. So sometimes people are very focused on,

01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:07.440
you know, very specific things about, like you said, science, like what the actual

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.280
work is, whether it's nuclear fusion or strategy PT. I just want to show that it's,

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:20.000
because I see it at MIT and everywhere, it's just human beings trying their best. They're flawed,

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:26.160
but just realizing that all of these very well accomplished people are all the same.

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.320
Yeah, that's a very good, well said.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.800
And then so then regular people and the young people, they're able to see, you know,

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.280
I can do this too. I can have a very big impact. Yeah, exactly. It's like, we're all kind of

01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:44.640
imposters. We're all like trying to figure it out. So let me just ask you about family. You wrote

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:49.840
that my family still jokes that the reason I never had children on my own was because I had

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.120
already raised my family. They're right. So this is talking to you upbringing, but in general,

01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:02.400
what was your, you know, leading a giant company, what was the right place to find a work life

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:09.600
balance for you to have, have time for family, have time for away from work and be successful.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.400
So I had to learn that. And I might've said, you know, you're the only one that can determine

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.160
your own work life balance. Companies are innate things. I mean, they will take everything they

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.720
can from you. And it's not a bad thing. They just will, as will bosses. I mean, you give it,

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:27.040
we'll take it. And when people ask for, you know, I need a roof. I'm like, okay,

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:32.720
I had to come with terms with the criminal was me. If I needed that balance, I had to set those

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:39.120
boundaries. And so when I comment about a family, because I am in extreme awe of people with children

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:45.760
who work, it is a extremely hard thing to do. I watch my siblings. I love my nieces and nephews

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.640
and who, you know, a, the emotional, their pain is your pain every minute of a day. And then you

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.920
still have a job on top of it. And so when my mom had to go back to school and had to work,

01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.560
I was the one. And so when she couldn't go to the teacher meeting, I went to the teacher meeting

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:07.280
when, and so in some ways, and there's an age gap between my brother and I and my other two sisters.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.920
And so I'm still, they still call me mama bear even. I mean, I'm extremely protective of all of

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:19.120
them. And it is as if I had raised them and my mom did a great job raising them. I didn't,

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:26.960
but I was there. And so when it came time to have children and my husband came from a family where

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.600
his father died and was raised by a single mother, very, very similar endpoint, different reasons

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:40.560
why he ended up, you know, his father did not abandon them. And I don't want people to believe

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:46.240
to do my job, you can have no children. That is not right. I know other great women CEOs,

01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.040
Marilyn Houston, who ran Lockheed Martin, extremely technical company, Mary Barrow,

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:55.600
who runs General Motors, Ellen Coleman, who run DuPont. These are all my friends to this day.

01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:03.200
And they've been fantastic mothers and husbands, good parents, right? And so I talk about it

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.360
because it was a choice we made. And so, you know, we both felt, look, we'd reached a point where,

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:14.400
for his reasons, what he had to do, I'd already felt that way. And that we were comfortable just

01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.800
being great aunts and uncles, and I'm a great aunt. You know, I like to think that for my little

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:25.840
guys and all, and they're older now, but lots of them. And there's no doubt though, the choices we

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:33.600
made, Mark and I, that that made it easier for me to focus on work. I mean, it's just math,

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:40.160
when you've got less people to have to take care of. And so I'm very considerate of that. And I

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.960
think much of it informed many of the policies I put into because I had such great empathy for

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:50.400
those who then still had these other responsibilities. And I desperately wanted them all to stay in the

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:56.480
workforce. So I can remember, and my siblings have been more successful than I, by the way,

01:45:56.480 --> 01:46:04.160
I mean, to my mother's credit. And my one sister, who, you know, went to Northwestern, has an MBA,

01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:09.840
built some of the most sophisticated systems. She spent her whole career at Accenture,

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.560
and just recently retired as a chief executive of all of consulting. But at one point, she took

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.360
off time to spend with her family, and then went to go back to work. She's talking to me, and she's

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.360
like, I don't know if I should go back to work. You know, maybe life's, you know, technology goes

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:29.600
so fast, it's been a few years. I'm sitting there like, what are you talking about? I'm like,

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.640
you know, look at her credentials, they're far outstanding. I'm like, and I thought to myself,

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.160
like, ding, one of those moments, if my own sister feels that way, with all her credentials,

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.040
I'll bet I went back to work the next day and I said, hey, pull for me all the people who've left

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:50.960
for parental reasons and or whatever family reasons didn't come back. And it began a program

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:55.360
of return ships. And I can't tell you how many in men and women was because they didn't feel

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.320
confident to come back. They thought technology passed them by. Okay, we said, it's three months,

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:03.760
you could stay one month, three months, doesn't matter. Well, a lot of people like one day,

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.080
they're like, you're right, not that much happened. It happened, but I caught up. I actually know more

01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:14.640
than I think, you know? And, and I, so it was a long answer to your question about, I didn't,

01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:21.200
but I am so empathetic. And I am in awe of what they are able to do. So, and it made me then,

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.760
I think, more empathetic to the policies and the like around that topic. So you could keep great

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:30.480
people in the workforce. So you mentioned your friends with Mayabara, the CEO of GM.

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.920
I didn't mean to name drop. So don't, I didn't mean it that way. No, I love her. She's amazing. So I

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.920
just wanted to, I'm just curious. I'll tell Mary, she should do your podcast. Well, we'll make it

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.600
happen. She's a great leader. I always, I tell Mary, what I think of her is I think she's one

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.080
of the most authentic leaders out there, most authentic. I mean, he's just very different

01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.440
companies, huge challenges. I worked there first, I remember, right? So I'm very, you know, in some

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.840
ways I'm very beholden, right? You know, I'm very appreciative of what they did. I mean, Mary and I

01:47:57.840 --> 01:48:03.120
are circa the same. Well, I'm a bit older, so, but circa that genre. Do you exchange wisdoms? Oh,

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.840
yeah. Yeah. When you do anything hard, it takes time and perseverance, like we talked about.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:15.360
And you can get that, where do you get the fuel for it? You can either get it from your attitude

01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.480
or you can get it from your network or your relationships. And I'm a firm believer relationships

01:48:20.480 --> 01:48:25.920
are from what you give, not what you get. Meaning you give, trust me, they will come back at the

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.200
time they need to come back to you at these moments in life. If you focus on, how can I bring

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.800
Lex value? There'll be a day I need Lex and he will be back. And so to those women, to me,

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:45.440
relationships are not transactional. And it's a proof that to this day, even though I'm no longer

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:51.040
still active as a CEO, these are all still my friends and they're, we are friends, all of us.

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:56.480
And I can remember some of them when I first became a CEO calling me and saying, hey,

01:48:56.480 --> 01:49:01.840
it's a little lonely here. So let me talk to you. And then when they became, I did the same for them

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:08.880
and then they remember and they do for the next generation. And so it's a very supportive,

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.160
almost to a T, any of the women you could name who have been CEOs, I would say,

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:18.400
almost to a T have all been very supportive. In fact, a number of us work on a little,

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:23.440
another non-for-profit right now called Journey, which some women who had started the Fortune's

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.560
Most Powerful Women had started, which was could we get more women, particularly diverse women,

01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:32.800
but women in general to more quickly be into positions of leadership and power.

01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:39.200
And so many of the women you named and more, you know, we all dedicate time mentoring in kind of

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:43.200
creating this little group of fellows every year to do this. Friendship and love is core to this

01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:47.920
whole thing, not just the success, but just the whole human condition. Let me ask one last question,

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:55.040
advice for young people. You've had a difficult upbringing, a difficult life, and you've become

01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:59.680
one of the most successful human beings in history. What advice would you give to young people

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.000
or just people in general who are struggling a bit, trying to figure out how they can have a

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.080
career they can be proud of, or maybe a life they can be proud of? I feel like a life you can be

01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:15.520
proud of is just one if you leave something a little bit better. It doesn't have to be big,

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:19.200
you know, that's a life well lived, right? It was Churchill has said,

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:24.400
it was how you might remember it better than I. You make a living by what you get,

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.560
and you live a life by what you give, something to that effect. But my advice would probably,

01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.840
when I'm asked this, I would tell them to ask more questions and give answers.

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:44.080
Just focus on being a sponge. And it's funny, I asked my husband the same question the other day,

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:51.120
I said, hey, we're talking to somebody and people were asking this and he sort of paused for a while

01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.640
and he said, I'd tell them patience. I said, what do you mean? And he said,

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.240
I see so many young people, like they're in such a hurry to somewhere, I don't know where.

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:06.000
And that if they just had patience and let life unfold, I think they may be surprised where they

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:12.560
ended up. And actually, I think that's a really good answer, to be honest. Along the way, keep

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:17.040
asking questions, keep that childlike curiosity. I know, it sounds so easy to say.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.360
Like you said, the obvious things, I think they tend to be the most profound.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.360
You're an incredible human being, your inspiration is so many. Thank you for

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:36.640
helping run and contribute to one of the great companies that bring so much good power to the

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:42.080
world. And thank you for putting in the hard work of putting it all in the great book. And

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:45.760
thank you for talking today. This is a huge honor. Thank you for doing it. You did a lovely job.
