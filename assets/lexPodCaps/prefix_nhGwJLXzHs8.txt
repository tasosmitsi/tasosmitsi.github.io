00:00.000 --> 00:02.540
The following is a conversation with Brian Keating,

00:02.540 --> 00:05.160
experimental physicist at USCSD

00:05.160 --> 00:07.760
and author of Losing the Nobel Prize

00:07.760 --> 00:10.280
and Into the Impossible.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.680
Plus, he's a host of the amazing podcast

00:12.680 --> 00:16.880
of the same name called Into the Impossible.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.880
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.020
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:21.020 --> 00:22.160
in the description.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.980
And now, here's my conversation with Brian Keating.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.560
As an experimental physicist,

00:29.600 --> 00:31.400
what do you think is the most amazing

00:31.400 --> 00:34.680
or maybe the coolest measurement device

00:34.680 --> 00:37.920
you've ever worked with or humans have ever built?

00:37.920 --> 00:41.600
Maybe for now, let's exclude the background imaging

00:41.600 --> 00:45.280
of cosmic extra-galactic polarization instruments.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.360
Yeah, I'm slightly biased

00:46.360 --> 00:48.040
towards that particular instrument, but-

00:48.040 --> 00:49.120
Talk about that in a little bit.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.640
Yeah, but certainly the telescope, to me,

00:51.640 --> 00:55.840
is a lever that has literally moved the Earth

00:55.840 --> 00:56.680
throughout history.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.040
So the OG telescope?

00:58.040 --> 00:59.100
The OG telescope, yeah.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.100
The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,

01:02.100 --> 01:05.940
but by this guy, Hans Lipperchet, in the Netherlands.

01:05.940 --> 01:07.740
And it was kind of interesting

01:07.740 --> 01:12.460
because in the 1600s, 14, 1500s, 1600s,

01:12.460 --> 01:14.420
there was the beginning of movable type.

01:14.420 --> 01:17.420
And so people, for the first time in history,

01:17.420 --> 01:21.060
had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.500
So looking at a printed word now,

01:22.500 --> 01:24.960
we just take it for granted, 12-point font, whatever,

01:24.960 --> 01:26.420
and that's what the eye charts are based on.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.260
They're just fixed height.

01:27.260 --> 01:30.260
But back then, there was no way to adjust your eyesight

01:30.260 --> 01:33.300
if you didn't have perfect vision.

01:33.300 --> 01:34.320
And there was no way to even tell

01:34.320 --> 01:35.380
if you had perfect vision or not

01:35.380 --> 01:39.000
until the Gutenberg Bible and movable type.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.300
And at that time, people realized,

01:40.300 --> 01:41.660
hey, wait, I can't read this.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.800
My priest or my friend over here, he can read it,

01:43.800 --> 01:44.700
she can read it.

01:44.700 --> 01:45.520
I can't read it.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.360
What's going on?

01:46.360 --> 01:50.700
And that's when these people in Venice and in the Netherlands

01:50.700 --> 01:53.300
saw that they could take this kind of glass material

01:53.300 --> 01:55.880
and hold it up and maybe put another piece of glass material

01:55.880 --> 01:57.560
and it would make it clearer.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.560
And what was so interesting is that nobody thought

01:59.560 --> 02:02.640
to take that exact same device, two lenses,

02:02.640 --> 02:04.680
and go like, hmm, let me go like this

02:04.680 --> 02:07.160
and look at that bright thing in the sky over there

02:07.160 --> 02:08.440
until Galileo.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.180
So Galileo didn't invent it,

02:10.180 --> 02:12.480
but he did something kind of amazing.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.800
He improved on it by a factor of 10.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.800
So he 10x'd it, which is almost as good as going from zero

02:17.800 --> 02:20.320
to one is going from one to 10.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.880
And when he did that, he really transformed

02:24.880 --> 02:28.480
both how we look at the universe and think about it,

02:28.480 --> 02:30.600
but also who we are as a species,

02:30.600 --> 02:34.240
because we're using tools not to get food faster

02:34.240 --> 02:39.240
or to preserve our legacy for future generations,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.700
but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.

02:43.700 --> 02:47.000
Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans weren't able

02:47.000 --> 02:51.200
to see the star, maybe there was some kind of make-up

02:51.200 --> 02:53.860
of the atmosphere, which for the early humans

02:53.860 --> 02:55.740
made it impossible to see the stars,

02:55.740 --> 02:57.820
that we would never develop human civilization,

02:57.820 --> 03:00.420
or at least raising the question of how important is it

03:00.420 --> 03:03.820
to look up to the sky and wonder what's out there,

03:03.820 --> 03:07.980
as opposed to maybe this is an over-romanticized notion,

03:07.980 --> 03:10.700
but looking at the ground, it feels like a little bit

03:10.700 --> 03:13.420
too much focused on survival and not being eaten

03:13.420 --> 03:15.380
by a bear slash lion.

03:15.380 --> 03:17.380
If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder,

03:17.380 --> 03:18.620
what is my place in the universe?

03:18.620 --> 03:21.340
Do you think that's modern humans romanticizing?

03:21.340 --> 03:22.860
I think it's a little romantic,

03:22.860 --> 03:27.020
because they also took the same two lenses

03:27.020 --> 03:28.060
and they looked inward, right?

03:28.060 --> 03:30.300
They looked at bacteria, they looked at hairs,

03:30.300 --> 03:32.260
and in other words, they made the microscope,

03:32.260 --> 03:33.700
and we're still doing that.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.500
And so to have a telescope serves a dual purpose.

03:37.500 --> 03:41.860
It's not only a way of looking out, it's looking in,

03:41.860 --> 03:43.460
but it's also looking back in time.

03:43.460 --> 03:44.700
In other words, you don't see a microscope,

03:44.700 --> 03:46.700
you don't think, oh, I'm seeing this thing as it was

03:46.700 --> 03:49.980
one nanosecond ago, light travels one foot per nanosecond.

03:50.860 --> 03:51.860
No, you don't think about it like that,

03:51.860 --> 03:53.700
but when you see something that's happening

03:53.700 --> 03:55.940
on Jupiter, the moon, Andromeda Galaxy,

03:55.940 --> 03:58.140
you're seeing things back when Lucy was walking

03:58.140 --> 04:00.060
around the Serengeti Plains.

04:00.060 --> 04:03.340
And for that, I think that took then the knowledge

04:03.340 --> 04:06.820
of relativity and time travel and so forth,

04:06.820 --> 04:08.820
it took that before we could really say,

04:08.820 --> 04:12.220
oh, we really unlocked some cheat codes in the human brain.

04:12.220 --> 04:14.100
So I think that might be a little too much,

04:14.100 --> 04:15.820
but nevertheless, I mean,

04:15.820 --> 04:17.580
what's better than having a time machine?

04:17.580 --> 04:19.260
It's like, we can look back in time,

04:19.260 --> 04:21.660
we see things as they were, not as they are,

04:21.660 --> 04:23.180
and that allows us to do many things,

04:23.180 --> 04:24.660
including speculate about that.

04:24.660 --> 04:25.740
But one of the coolest things,

04:25.740 --> 04:26.580
I don't know if you're familiar with,

04:26.580 --> 04:27.940
so I'm a radio astronomer,

04:27.940 --> 04:30.300
I don't actually look through telescopes very often,

04:30.300 --> 04:33.980
except on rare occasions when I take one out

04:33.980 --> 04:37.820
to show the kids, but a radio telescope

04:37.820 --> 04:39.780
is even more sort of visceral,

04:39.780 --> 04:40.660
I mean, it's much less cool,

04:40.660 --> 04:41.500
cause you look at it and you're like,

04:41.500 --> 04:43.780
all right, it looks cool, it's kind of weird shaped thing,

04:43.780 --> 04:45.020
looks like it belongs in sci-fi,

04:45.020 --> 04:48.140
it's gonna blast the Death Star or whatever.

04:48.140 --> 04:52.100
But when you realize that when you point a radio telescope

04:52.100 --> 04:53.580
at a distant object,

04:53.580 --> 04:55.980
if that object fills up what's called the beam,

04:55.980 --> 04:59.420
which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,

04:59.420 --> 05:00.540
it's called its beam,

05:00.540 --> 05:03.580
if you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,

05:03.580 --> 05:05.820
just a simple absorbing piece of material

05:05.820 --> 05:07.780
at the focus of the radio telescope,

05:07.780 --> 05:11.220
that resistor will come to the exact same temperature

05:11.220 --> 05:13.100
as the object that it's looking at,

05:13.100 --> 05:13.940
which is pretty amazing.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.180
It means you're actually remotely measuring,

05:16.180 --> 05:17.980
you're taking the temperature of Jupiter

05:18.820 --> 05:20.220
or whatever in effect.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.660
And so it's allowing you to basically teleport

05:23.660 --> 05:24.940
and there's no other science

05:24.940 --> 05:26.100
that you can really do that, right?

05:26.100 --> 05:27.380
If you're an archeologist, you can't,

05:27.380 --> 05:29.780
let me get into my time machine

05:29.780 --> 05:32.300
and go back and see what was Lucy really like,

05:32.300 --> 05:33.140
it's not possible.

05:33.140 --> 05:34.900
So the same thing happens,

05:34.900 --> 05:36.300
this is where I've learned about this

05:36.300 --> 05:37.380
from March of the Penguins,

05:37.380 --> 05:39.100
when the penguins huddled together,

05:40.780 --> 05:43.340
the body temperature arrives to the same place,

05:43.340 --> 05:44.940
so you're doing this remotely,

05:44.940 --> 05:46.940
this is the March of the Penguins, but remote.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.140
Do it from Antarctica too,

05:48.140 --> 05:50.460
so there are some penguins around when we do it.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.460
Okay, excellent.

05:51.460 --> 05:53.500
You mentioned time machine,

05:53.500 --> 05:57.100
I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize,

05:57.100 --> 05:59.700
you talk about time machines.

05:59.700 --> 06:04.540
So let me ask you the question of take us back in time,

06:04.540 --> 06:07.900
what happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:07.900 --> 06:09.860
Okay, usually people preface this

06:09.860 --> 06:11.220
by saying I have a simple question.

06:11.220 --> 06:15.220
So what happened before the universe began, what happened?

06:15.260 --> 06:17.580
Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.020
I have a simple question for you, let's take two.

06:21.020 --> 06:22.100
I have a simple question,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.340
what happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:24.340 --> 06:25.180
All right, good.

06:25.180 --> 06:28.180
So when we think about what happened,

06:28.180 --> 06:30.580
it's more correct, it's more logical,

06:30.580 --> 06:34.700
it's more practical to go back in time starting from today.

06:34.700 --> 06:39.700
So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,

06:40.540 --> 06:41.660
that's some day, right?

06:41.660 --> 06:43.420
I mean, you could translate it into some day, right?

06:43.420 --> 06:48.420
So on that day, something happened earlier than the moment,

06:48.420 --> 06:52.180
exactly now, let's say we're talking around one o'clock.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.500
So at some point during that day,

06:54.500 --> 06:57.260
the universe started to become a fusion reactor.

06:57.260 --> 07:00.180
It started to fuse light elements and isotopes

07:00.180 --> 07:03.540
into heavier elements and isotopes of those heavier elements.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.100
After that period of time,

07:05.100 --> 07:06.620
going forward back closer to today,

07:06.620 --> 07:09.700
less 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,

07:09.700 --> 07:11.980
or later rather coming towards us today,

07:11.980 --> 07:14.420
we know more and more about what the universe was like.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.540
And in fact, all the hydrogen,

07:16.540 --> 07:19.100
it's a very good approximation in the water molecules

07:19.100 --> 07:21.420
in this bottle, almost all of them were produced

07:21.420 --> 07:23.700
during that first 20 minute period.

07:23.700 --> 07:27.860
So I would say, the actual fusion and production

07:27.860 --> 07:30.580
of the lightest elements on the periodic table

07:30.580 --> 07:32.380
occurred in a time period shorter

07:32.380 --> 07:34.420
than the TV show, The Big Bang Theory.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.260
Well done, sir.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.220
Most of those light elements besides hydrogen

07:39.220 --> 07:41.700
aren't really used in your encounter, right?

07:42.260 --> 07:44.100
You don't encounter helium that often

07:44.100 --> 07:45.660
unless you go to a lot of birthday parties

07:45.660 --> 07:47.500
or pilot a blimp.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.780
You don't need lithium, hopefully.

07:49.780 --> 07:50.620
But other than that,

07:50.620 --> 07:51.460
those are the kinds of things

07:51.460 --> 07:52.620
that were produced during that moment.

07:52.620 --> 07:54.580
The question became, how did the heavier things

07:54.580 --> 07:57.100
like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.100
And I brought some samples for us to discuss

08:00.100 --> 08:02.540
and how those came from a very different type of process

08:02.540 --> 08:04.980
called a different type of fusion reactor

08:04.980 --> 08:07.460
and a different type of process explosion as well

08:07.460 --> 08:08.860
called a supernova.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.780
However, if you go back to the beyond

08:10.780 --> 08:11.620
the first three minutes,

08:11.620 --> 08:13.940
we really have to say almost nothing

08:13.940 --> 08:16.300
because we are not capable, in other words,

08:16.300 --> 08:18.900
going backwards from the first three minutes

08:18.900 --> 08:21.900
as famous Steven Weinberg titled his book,

08:21.900 --> 08:25.220
we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over.

08:25.220 --> 08:28.340
In other words, we can't speculate on what happened

08:28.340 --> 08:31.020
three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen

08:31.020 --> 08:32.420
was formed in our universe.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.780
We just don't know enough about that epoch.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.340
There are many people, most people,

08:36.340 --> 08:38.860
most practicing card-carrying cosmologists

08:38.860 --> 08:40.020
believe the universe began

08:40.020 --> 08:42.060
in what's called the singularity.

08:42.060 --> 08:44.460
And we can certainly talk about that.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.500
However, singularity is so far removed

08:46.500 --> 08:49.180
from anything we can ever hope to prove,

08:49.180 --> 08:51.980
hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence

08:51.980 --> 08:54.980
and really only occurs in two instantiations,

08:54.980 --> 08:57.020
the big bang and the core of a black hole,

08:57.020 --> 08:58.660
neither of which is observable.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.180
And so for that reason,

09:00.180 --> 09:02.060
there are now flourishing alternatives

09:02.060 --> 09:04.220
that say you can actually for the first time

09:04.220 --> 09:06.620
ask the question that day,

09:06.620 --> 09:10.900
Tuesday, in the first moments of our universe,

09:10.900 --> 09:13.420
there was a Tuesday a week before that,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.620
24 hours time, seven days before that.

09:16.580 --> 09:19.940
That has a perfectly well understood meaning

09:19.940 --> 09:23.740
in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more

09:23.740 --> 09:26.020
eminent of cosmologists working today.

09:26.020 --> 09:28.660
When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,

09:28.660 --> 09:31.180
no one really considered anything besides that big bang

09:31.180 --> 09:33.020
that there was a singularity.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.260
And people would have to say, as I said,

09:35.260 --> 09:36.900
we just don't know.

09:36.900 --> 09:39.340
But they would say some future incarnation

09:39.340 --> 09:41.340
of some experiment will tell us the answer.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.460
But now there are people that are saying

09:43.460 --> 09:45.900
there is an alternative to the big bang.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.980
And it's not really fringe science as it once was

09:48.980 --> 09:51.420
50, 80 years ago when these models,

09:51.420 --> 09:54.300
by the way, the first cosmology in history

09:54.300 --> 09:56.260
was not a singular universe.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.820
The first cosmology in history goes back to Akhenaten, Ra

09:59.820 --> 10:04.260
and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.740
And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.700
So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court,

10:09.700 --> 10:12.100
he'd have a pretty high H index right about now

10:12.100 --> 10:14.860
because people have been using that cyclical model

10:14.860 --> 10:18.300
from Penrose to Paul Steinhardt and Aegis

10:18.300 --> 10:21.380
and right up until this very moment.

10:21.380 --> 10:25.660
Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives

10:25.660 --> 10:27.940
to the big bang theory?

10:27.940 --> 10:30.420
So there are many alternatives starting with,

10:30.420 --> 10:34.180
so the singularity quantum cosmologically demanding

10:35.060 --> 10:36.380
singular origin of the universe,

10:36.380 --> 10:39.300
that stands in contrast to these other models

10:39.300 --> 10:41.300
in which time does not have a beginning.

10:42.940 --> 10:45.580
And many of them feature cycles, at least one cycle,

10:45.580 --> 10:48.020
possibly infinite number of cycles

10:48.020 --> 10:49.300
called by Sir Roger Penrose.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.340
And they all have things in common, these alternatives,

10:52.340 --> 10:55.500
as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,

10:55.500 --> 10:56.620
which is inflation.

10:56.620 --> 11:00.540
Inflation can be thought of as this spark

11:00.540 --> 11:03.420
that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.060
So it's an earlier condition,

11:05.060 --> 11:07.020
but it's still not an initial condition.

11:07.020 --> 11:10.100
In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock

11:10.100 --> 11:11.900
or a pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.820
You look away for a second, you come into the room,

11:14.820 --> 11:15.900
pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.860
Alex, tell me, where did it start?

11:17.860 --> 11:20.020
How many cycles is it gonna make before the era?

11:20.020 --> 11:21.260
You can't answer that question

11:21.260 --> 11:23.220
without knowing the initial conditions.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.540
In a very simple system like a one dimensional

11:25.540 --> 11:27.700
simple harmonic oscillator like a pendulum,

11:27.700 --> 11:29.620
think about understanding the whole universe

11:29.620 --> 11:31.780
without understanding the initial conditions.

11:31.780 --> 11:35.340
It's a tremendous lacuna gap that we have as scientists

11:35.340 --> 11:39.700
that we may not be able to in the inflationary cosmology

11:39.700 --> 11:42.500
determine the quantitative physical properties

11:42.500 --> 11:44.220
of the universe prior to what's called

11:44.220 --> 11:45.540
the inflationary epoch.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.660
So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch, we can't,

11:48.660 --> 11:51.380
because you can infer things about the pendulum

11:51.380 --> 11:54.740
before you show up to the room in our current epoch,

11:54.740 --> 11:55.580
correct?

11:55.580 --> 11:57.140
Yeah, so if you look at it right now,

11:57.140 --> 11:58.980
but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?

11:58.980 --> 12:01.380
So that depends on how much energy it got initially,

12:01.380 --> 12:03.420
and you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,

12:03.420 --> 12:05.180
you had infrared camera, you can see it's getting hotter

12:05.180 --> 12:07.540
maybe, and you could do some calculations,

12:07.540 --> 12:09.580
but to know the two things in physics

12:09.580 --> 12:11.260
to solve a partial differential equation

12:11.260 --> 12:13.340
are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.

12:13.340 --> 12:14.420
Boundary conditions were here on earth

12:14.420 --> 12:15.580
that has gravitational field.

12:15.580 --> 12:18.420
It's not gonna make excursions wildly

12:18.420 --> 12:19.740
beyond the length of the pendulum.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.420
It's not, you know, it has simple properties.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.620
So, and this is like, in other words,

12:25.620 --> 12:29.100
you can't tell me when did the solar system start orbiting

12:29.100 --> 12:30.380
in the way that it does now.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.820
In other words, when did the moon acquire

12:31.820 --> 12:33.980
the exact angular momentum that it has now?

12:35.100 --> 12:36.740
Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example,

12:36.740 --> 12:40.420
but what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch

12:40.420 --> 12:43.900
purports and is successful at providing a lot

12:43.900 --> 12:46.620
of explanations for how the universe evolved

12:46.620 --> 12:48.940
after inflation took place and ended,

12:48.940 --> 12:52.500
but it says nothing about how it itself took place.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.100
And that's really what you're asking me.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.620
I mean, you don't really, look, what you care about,

12:56.620 --> 12:59.220
like big bang nucleosynthesis and the elements got made

12:59.300 --> 13:01.700
in these fusion reactors and the whole universe

13:01.700 --> 13:03.980
was a fusion reactor, but like, don't you really care

13:03.980 --> 13:06.900
about what happened at the beginning of time,

13:06.900 --> 13:08.860
at the first moment of time?

13:08.860 --> 13:11.620
And the problem is we can't really answer that

13:11.620 --> 13:13.420
in the context of the big bang.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.180
We can't answer that in the context of these alternatives.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.380
So you asked me about some of the alternatives.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.060
So one is Aon theory, the conformal cyclic cosmology

13:20.060 --> 13:21.500
of Sir Roger Penrose.

13:21.500 --> 13:25.740
Another one that was really popular in the 60s and 70s

13:25.740 --> 13:28.500
until the discovery of the primary component

13:28.500 --> 13:30.660
in my research field, the cosmic microwave background

13:30.660 --> 13:33.580
radiation or CMB, the three Kelvin all pervasive signal

13:33.580 --> 13:36.780
that astronomers detected in 1965,

13:36.780 --> 13:39.660
that kind of spelled the death knell in some sense

13:39.660 --> 13:42.620
to what was called the quasi steady state universe.

13:44.020 --> 13:48.060
And then there was another model

13:48.060 --> 13:49.660
that kind of came out of that.

13:49.660 --> 13:52.180
You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state.

13:52.180 --> 13:53.660
Steady state means always existed.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.100
That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble

13:56.100 --> 13:59.380
showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.380
And most scientists believed in that for millennia,

14:02.380 --> 14:05.980
basically the universe was eternal, static, unchanging.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.420
They couldn't believe that after Hubble.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.860
So they had to append onto it,

14:09.860 --> 14:13.300
concatenate this new feature that it wasn't steady,

14:13.300 --> 14:14.780
it was quasi steady.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.220
So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen

14:17.220 --> 14:20.060
every century in a given volume of space.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.220
And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant,

14:23.220 --> 14:25.380
but because it was producing more and more every century,

14:25.380 --> 14:27.340
the centuries pile up and the volume piles up,

14:27.340 --> 14:28.660
the universe could expand.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.060
And so that's how they developed it.

14:30.060 --> 14:30.900
That's slowly.

14:30.900 --> 14:31.740
Very slowly.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.740
And it doesn't match observational evidence.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.460
But that is an alternative.

14:35.460 --> 14:38.380
By the way, did Einstein think the steady state universe

14:38.380 --> 14:40.220
is infinite or finite, do you know?

14:41.620 --> 14:43.740
I would assume that he thought it was infinite

14:43.740 --> 14:45.620
because there was really,

14:45.620 --> 14:48.580
if something had a no beginning in time,

14:48.580 --> 14:50.980
then it would be very unlikely we're in the center of it

14:50.980 --> 14:54.340
or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.380
I wonder what he thought about infinity

14:56.380 --> 14:58.220
because that's such an uncomfortable question.

14:58.220 --> 14:59.060
It's a silly joke.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.100
I'm sure you're familiar with this silly joke, right?

15:01.100 --> 15:03.260
The silly joke was that there are only two things

15:03.260 --> 15:06.980
that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,

15:06.980 --> 15:08.940
and I'm not sure about the universe.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.260
Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke

15:11.260 --> 15:13.180
is a good example of the joke.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.460
It's very meta.

15:14.460 --> 15:19.020
Okay, so, sorry, you were saying about quasi,

15:19.020 --> 15:20.940
all the alternatives in the quasi steady state.

15:20.940 --> 15:22.820
And the most kind of promising,

15:22.820 --> 15:24.340
although I hate to say that,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.140
people say like, well, it's your favorite alternative, right?

15:27.140 --> 15:29.500
This is not investment advice.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.900
Inflation is not transitory.

15:31.900 --> 15:33.540
It is quasi permanent.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.780
So a very prominent-

15:35.780 --> 15:36.620
Sorry to interrupt.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.220
We were talking about cosmic inflation,

15:38.220 --> 15:40.340
so calm down, cryptocurrency folks.

15:40.340 --> 15:41.180
That's right.

15:41.180 --> 15:43.100
Although the first Nobel Prize

15:43.100 --> 15:45.220
and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics

15:45.220 --> 15:48.420
was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.

15:48.420 --> 15:49.260
So most people don't know that.

15:49.260 --> 15:50.580
Inflation has already won a Nobel Prize.

15:50.580 --> 15:51.860
It's a good topic to work on

15:51.860 --> 15:55.140
if you want a Nobel Prize, doesn't matter the field.

15:55.140 --> 15:57.340
Exactly, it's time translation invariant.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.940
So when we look at the alternative

15:59.940 --> 16:03.140
that's called the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,

16:03.140 --> 16:07.140
these have serious virtues according to some.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.060
One of the virtues to me, just as a human,

16:10.060 --> 16:11.980
I'm just speaking as a human,

16:12.900 --> 16:15.700
one of the founders of the new version

16:15.700 --> 16:20.540
of the cyclic cosmology called the bouncing cosmology,

16:21.340 --> 16:22.540
is Paul Steinhardt.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.780
He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences

16:24.780 --> 16:25.780
at Princeton University.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.060
You may have heard of it.

16:27.060 --> 16:29.580
And he was one of the originators

16:29.580 --> 16:32.300
of what was called new inflation.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.420
In other words, he was one of the founding fathers

16:34.420 --> 16:38.580
of inflation who now not only has no belief

16:38.580 --> 16:40.020
or support for inflation,

16:40.020 --> 16:44.100
he actively claims that inflation is baroque,

16:44.100 --> 16:46.940
pernicious, dangerous, malevolent,

16:46.940 --> 16:50.980
not to science, not just to cosmology, but to society.

16:50.980 --> 16:53.460
So here's a man who created a theory

16:53.460 --> 16:56.340
that's captivated the world or universe of cosmologists,

16:56.340 --> 16:58.100
such as it is, it's not a huge universe,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.980
but they're more podcasters than cosmologists.

17:00.980 --> 17:05.220
Some do both, but this man created this theory

17:05.220 --> 17:06.900
with collaborators.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.580
And now he's like, I joke, I'm like,

17:08.580 --> 17:10.660
Paul, you're denying paternity.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.140
You're like a deadbeat dad.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.780
Now you're saying like inflation is bogus.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.380
But he doesn't just attack.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.700
See, this is what's very important

17:18.700 --> 17:21.540
about approaching things as an experimentalist.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.540
You got a lot of theorists on, and that's wonderful.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.220
And I think that's a huge service.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.820
An experimentalist has to say no.

17:27.820 --> 17:30.420
He or she has to be confident to say like,

17:30.420 --> 17:32.860
I don't care if I prove you right

17:32.860 --> 17:35.300
or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.100
We have to be like exterminators.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.540
And nobody likes the exterminator until they need one, right?

17:39.540 --> 17:41.420
Or the garbage collectors, right?

17:41.420 --> 17:45.020
But it's vital that we be completely kind of

17:45.020 --> 17:48.220
unpersuaded by the beauty and the magnificence

17:48.220 --> 17:50.140
and the symmetry and the simplicity of some idea.

17:50.140 --> 17:52.500
Like inflation is a beautiful idea,

17:52.500 --> 17:54.020
but it also has consequences.

17:54.020 --> 17:56.260
And what Paul claims, I don't agree with him fully

17:56.260 --> 17:59.220
on this point, is that those consequences are dangerous

17:59.220 --> 18:01.460
because they lead to things like the multiverse,

18:01.460 --> 18:03.780
which is outside the purview of science.

18:03.780 --> 18:07.300
And in that sense, I can see support for what he does,

18:07.300 --> 18:09.100
but none of that detracts from my respect.

18:09.140 --> 18:12.300
For a man, imagine like,

18:12.300 --> 18:15.540
Elon comes up with this like really great idea, space,

18:15.540 --> 18:18.740
and then he's like, actually, it's not gonna work.

18:18.740 --> 18:19.940
But like, here's this better idea.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.580
And he's like, SpaceX is not gonna work,

18:21.580 --> 18:23.860
but he's now creating an alternative to it.

18:23.860 --> 18:26.500
It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.620
Doesn't mean he's right.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.780
Doesn't mean I'm gonna like have more

18:29.780 --> 18:32.540
and more attention paid to it because he's my friend

18:32.540 --> 18:35.620
or because I respect the idea or I respect the man

18:35.620 --> 18:37.020
and his colleague, Ana Aegis,

18:37.020 --> 18:39.020
who works really hard with him.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.060
But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.

18:42.060 --> 18:46.140
And what it does most foremost is that it removes

18:46.140 --> 18:49.780
the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.660
So it takes away 50% of the motivation

18:52.660 --> 18:54.820
for a theory of quantum gravity.

18:54.820 --> 18:57.100
You've talked a lot about quantum gravity.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.380
You talk to people, eminent people on the show.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.460
Always latent in those conversations

19:01.460 --> 19:04.140
is sort of the teleological expectation

19:04.140 --> 19:06.660
that there is a theory of everything.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.740
There is a theory of quantum gravity,

19:09.420 --> 19:11.540
but there's no law that says we have to have a theory

19:11.540 --> 19:12.780
of quantum gravity.

19:12.780 --> 19:16.260
So that kind of implicit expectation

19:16.260 --> 19:19.460
has to do ultimately with the inflationary theory

19:19.460 --> 19:21.140
so in cosmic inflation.

19:21.140 --> 19:23.340
So is that at the core?

19:23.340 --> 19:27.980
So okay, maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts

19:27.980 --> 19:32.980
on society from believing in cosmic inflation.

19:33.420 --> 19:37.700
So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,

19:37.740 --> 19:40.220
according to its other two patriarchs,

19:40.220 --> 19:41.220
considered to be its patriarchs,

19:41.220 --> 19:44.580
Alan Guth at MIT and Andrei Linde at Stanford,

19:44.580 --> 19:45.940
although he was in the USSR

19:45.940 --> 19:48.540
when he came up with these ideas,

19:48.540 --> 19:51.660
along with Paul Steinhardt was that the universe

19:51.660 --> 19:55.660
has to eventually get into a quantum state.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.500
It has to exist in this Hilbert space

19:57.500 --> 19:59.340
and the Hilbert space has certain features.

19:59.340 --> 20:00.780
And those features are quantum mechanical

20:00.780 --> 20:03.220
endowed with quantum mechanical properties.

20:03.220 --> 20:07.380
And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.100
So inflation can get started,

20:09.100 --> 20:11.940
but then it's like one of SpaceX rockets.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.380
It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster, right?

20:14.380 --> 20:17.780
It continues the thrusting and you need another mechanism

20:17.780 --> 20:21.220
to douse the flames of the inflationary expansion,

20:21.220 --> 20:24.180
which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,

20:24.180 --> 20:27.620
it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,

20:27.620 --> 20:32.460
including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.860
Some will die stillborn, some will continue and flourish.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.740
And this is known as the multiverse paradigm.

20:38.740 --> 20:40.940
It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence,

20:40.940 --> 20:43.420
not only of inflationary cosmology,

20:43.420 --> 20:45.460
but more and more we're seeing it in string theory as well.

20:45.460 --> 20:49.500
So sometimes two branches coming to the same conclusion

20:49.500 --> 20:52.260
is taken as evidence for its reality.

20:52.260 --> 20:56.460
So one of the negative consequences is it creates phenomena

20:56.460 --> 20:58.740
that we can't, that are outside the reach

20:58.740 --> 21:01.580
of experimental science,

21:01.580 --> 21:04.060
or is it that the multiverse somehow

21:04.060 --> 21:07.460
has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?

21:07.460 --> 21:08.780
Like it makes us,

21:10.820 --> 21:13.140
maybe it makes life seem more meaningless.

21:13.140 --> 21:15.900
Is that where he's getting at a little bit,

21:15.900 --> 21:18.020
or is it not reaching that far?

21:18.020 --> 21:20.900
Well, no, I think those are both kind of perceptive.

21:21.860 --> 21:22.940
The answer is a little both,

21:22.940 --> 21:25.660
because in one sense it's meant

21:25.660 --> 21:28.100
kind of to explain this fine tuning problem,

21:28.100 --> 21:29.820
that we find ourselves in a universe

21:29.820 --> 21:32.860
that's particularly fasund that has features

21:32.900 --> 21:34.780
consistent with our existence,

21:34.780 --> 21:36.500
and how could we be otherwise,

21:36.500 --> 21:38.940
the sort of weak anthropic principle.

21:38.940 --> 21:42.460
On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,

21:42.460 --> 21:45.980
literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.

21:45.980 --> 21:48.300
Like if I say, Lex, you've been working out,

21:48.300 --> 21:51.140
you look like, yeah, you haven't, yeah, it's great.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.780
You look like you're about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.460
Like, all right, yeah, you're right,

21:56.460 --> 21:57.820
but that's horribly imprecise.

21:57.820 --> 21:58.900
So what good is that?

21:58.900 --> 21:59.740
That's meaningless.

21:59.740 --> 22:01.660
I don't contribute any what's called surprise,

22:01.660 --> 22:03.220
or reduction in entropy,

22:03.220 --> 22:06.180
or reduction of your ignorance about the system,

22:06.180 --> 22:08.380
or you know exactly how much you weigh.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.340
So me telling you that tells you nothing.

22:10.340 --> 22:11.980
In this case, it's basically saying

22:11.980 --> 22:13.260
that we're living in a universe

22:13.260 --> 22:16.260
because the overwhelming odds of our existence

22:17.180 --> 22:18.980
dictate that we would exist.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.740
There has to be at least one place that we exist.

22:20.740 --> 22:24.140
But the problem is, it's a manifestation of infinity.

22:24.140 --> 22:26.660
So humans, and I'm sure you know this

22:26.660 --> 22:29.980
from your work with AI and ML and everything else,

22:30.860 --> 22:33.580
that humans, as far as we know,

22:33.580 --> 22:35.460
really are the only entities

22:35.460 --> 22:38.380
capable of contemplating infinity,

22:38.380 --> 22:40.660
but we do so very imperfectly, right?

22:40.660 --> 22:42.300
So if I say to you, like, what's bigger,

22:42.300 --> 22:45.220
the number of water molecules in this thing,

22:45.220 --> 22:46.740
or the number of real numbers?

22:46.740 --> 22:47.580
Or if I say, what's bigger,

22:47.580 --> 22:49.300
the number of real numbers or rational numbers?

22:49.300 --> 22:50.780
They're all different classifications

22:50.780 --> 22:53.220
of the amount of infinities that there could be.

22:53.220 --> 22:54.780
Infinity to the infinity power.

22:54.780 --> 22:55.900
We have kids someday, they'll tell you,

22:55.900 --> 22:56.980
I love you, infinity.

22:56.980 --> 22:59.420
You have to come back, I love you, infinity plus one, right?

23:00.140 --> 23:03.340
But the human brain can't really contemplate infinity.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.140
Let me illustrate that.

23:05.140 --> 23:06.820
They say in the singularity,

23:06.820 --> 23:10.700
the universe had an infinite temperature, right?

23:10.700 --> 23:12.460
So let me ask you a question.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.460
Is there anything that you can contemplate

23:14.460 --> 23:17.660
in the, you know, Einstein's little quip aside,

23:17.660 --> 23:20.180
that's infinite, like a physical property,

23:20.180 --> 23:24.860
density, pressure, temperature, energy, that's infinite?

23:24.860 --> 23:27.500
And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it,

23:27.540 --> 23:30.580
but if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?

23:30.580 --> 23:32.940
You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.

23:32.940 --> 23:34.580
How does it go from like to half of infinity?

23:34.580 --> 23:35.700
Cause that's still infinity.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.900
How did it cool down?

23:36.900 --> 23:39.460
How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?

23:39.460 --> 23:41.620
So now it's only infinity over two,

23:41.620 --> 23:42.460
in terms of Pascal's.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.620
Less infinite to more infinite.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.380
Yeah, I mean, it's,

23:46.380 --> 23:49.700
that's one of the biggest troubling things to me

23:49.700 --> 23:51.620
about infinity is,

23:51.620 --> 23:53.780
you can't truly hold it inside our minds.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.780
It's a mathematical construct that doesn't,

23:55.780 --> 23:57.820
it feels like intuition fails.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.940
But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly

23:59.940 --> 24:02.700
and then use like physicists,

24:02.700 --> 24:05.420
they're incredible intuition machines.

24:05.420 --> 24:06.940
And then they'll play with this infinity

24:06.940 --> 24:10.260
as if they can play with it on the level of intuition

24:10.260 --> 24:12.300
as opposed to on the level of math.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.060
You know, maybe it's something cyclical

24:14.060 --> 24:17.380
you can imagine infinity just going around the same,

24:18.540 --> 24:20.500
kind of like a Mobius strip situation.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.780
But then the question then arises,

24:23.820 --> 24:26.540
how do you make it more or less infinite?

24:26.540 --> 24:28.980
Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.

24:28.980 --> 24:31.340
And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?

24:31.340 --> 24:33.420
It's either some placeholder for infinity

24:33.420 --> 24:34.820
or it's one divided by a very,

24:34.820 --> 24:36.500
the smallest possible,

24:37.820 --> 24:39.740
real number that you can represent in the memory.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.540
Well, that's basically my undergraduate study

24:42.540 --> 24:44.300
in computer science is how to represent

24:44.300 --> 24:45.900
a floating point in a computer.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.980
I think I took 17 courses on this topic.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.100
It was very useful.

24:49.100 --> 24:50.020
I came to the right place.

24:50.020 --> 24:53.620
But, you know, in terms of what a physicist will mean,

24:53.620 --> 24:54.460
you're right.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.700
I mean, physicists will blithely, nonchalantly

24:56.700 --> 24:58.940
subtract infinity, you know, renormalization

24:58.940 --> 25:01.260
and do things to get finite answers.

25:01.260 --> 25:03.060
And it's miraculous.

25:03.060 --> 25:05.460
But, you know, at a certain point you have to ask,

25:05.460 --> 25:07.460
well, what are the consequences for the real world?

25:07.460 --> 25:10.300
So one of them, you ask, you know, what's the problem?

25:10.300 --> 25:11.820
Does it make us more meaningless?

25:11.820 --> 25:14.100
They purport, many of the people that support it,

25:14.100 --> 25:15.300
like Andre Lindy.

25:15.300 --> 25:18.140
In fact, Andre Lindy says, you have a bias,

25:18.140 --> 25:19.820
you Lex, me Brian,

25:19.820 --> 25:23.060
you have a bias that you believe in a universe,

25:23.060 --> 25:26.060
but shouldn't you believe in a multiverse?

25:26.060 --> 25:28.700
What evidence do you have that there's not a multiverse?

25:28.700 --> 25:30.140
So he turns it around.

25:30.140 --> 25:31.780
Whereas Paul Steinhardt will say,

25:31.780 --> 25:33.580
no, if anything can happen,

25:33.580 --> 25:36.020
then there's no predictive power within the theory.

25:36.020 --> 25:36.860
Because you can always say,

25:36.860 --> 25:39.260
well, this value of the inflationary field

25:39.260 --> 25:43.580
did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy

25:43.580 --> 25:45.100
for us to detect it with BICEP

25:45.100 --> 25:46.500
or Simon's Observatory or whatever.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.220
But that doesn't mean that inflation didn't happen.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.780
And that's logically 100% correct.

25:50.780 --> 25:52.780
But it's like, it's like kind of chewing, you know,

25:52.780 --> 25:54.380
Wonder Bread.

25:54.380 --> 25:57.020
You know, I apologize if they're one of your sponsors,

25:57.020 --> 25:58.180
but, you know.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.780
Wonderbreadslashlex.com.

26:01.780 --> 26:03.380
Type in code chleb, right?

26:03.380 --> 26:04.340
Isn't it chleb?

26:04.340 --> 26:06.020
It's my favorite Russian word is like,

26:06.020 --> 26:07.580
would you like a piece of chleb?

26:07.580 --> 26:10.940
By the way, even that, that word chleb,

26:10.940 --> 26:13.620
which means bread in Russian, as you say it,

26:13.620 --> 26:15.940
and like you were jokingly saying it now,

26:15.940 --> 26:18.180
it made me hungry because it made me remember

26:18.180 --> 26:20.700
how much I loved bread when I was in the Soviet Union.

26:21.620 --> 26:22.940
When you were like hungry,

26:22.940 --> 26:25.340
that was the things you dreamed about, I don't know.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.700
You know, what's amazing is how many of the Soviet

26:27.700 --> 26:31.020
scientists contributed to so much of what we understand

26:31.020 --> 26:33.340
today, and they were completely in hiding.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.700
Like there was no Google, they couldn't look up on Scholar.

26:35.700 --> 26:36.540
They had nothing.

26:36.540 --> 26:37.820
They had to wait for journals to get approved

26:37.820 --> 26:39.660
by the Communist Party to get approved.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.380
And then, and only then, if they weren't a member

26:42.380 --> 26:44.940
of some class, I'm sure you know, like Jewish scientists,

26:44.940 --> 26:48.260
you had a passport and it said Jew on your passport.

26:48.260 --> 26:52.700
And Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich,

26:52.700 --> 26:56.300
he was the advisor, one of my advisors, Alexander Polnarev.

26:56.300 --> 27:00.460
And he had to, only because he was like at a noble level

27:00.460 --> 27:01.700
and you know, was one of the fathers

27:01.700 --> 27:03.700
of the Soviet atomic bomb program,

27:03.700 --> 27:06.900
could he even get his Jewish student, he was Jewish too,

27:06.900 --> 27:09.460
but only by virtue of his standing

27:09.460 --> 27:11.140
of his intellectual accomplishments,

27:11.140 --> 27:14.180
would they give him the dispensation to let his student,

27:14.180 --> 27:15.980
you know, travel to Georgia or something.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.900
And it makes what we complain about,

27:17.900 --> 27:19.860
and I complain about academia and it's like,

27:19.860 --> 27:21.940
oh, well, what can I talk about?

27:21.940 --> 27:24.100
We have no idea of how good it is

27:24.100 --> 27:26.620
and that they were able to create things like inflation,

27:26.620 --> 27:28.100
completely isolated from the West.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.380
I mean, some of these people didn't meet like people

27:30.380 --> 27:33.060
like Stephen Hawking until, you know, he was almost dead.

27:33.060 --> 27:35.780
And they just learned this thing through smuggled in,

27:35.780 --> 27:39.260
you know, it's a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.780
There's so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard,

27:41.780 --> 27:43.660
probably because they were working,

27:43.660 --> 27:44.860
they could pass off as well,

27:44.860 --> 27:47.140
we're doing stuff for the atomic bomb program as well,

27:47.180 --> 27:48.020
which they were.

27:48.020 --> 27:52.300
At the same time, there is interesting incentives

27:52.300 --> 27:55.980
in the Soviet system that maybe we can take this tangent

27:55.980 --> 28:00.700
for a brief moment that because there's a dictatorship,

28:00.700 --> 28:02.980
authoritarian regime throughout the history

28:02.980 --> 28:05.660
of the 20th century for the Soviet Union,

28:05.660 --> 28:07.780
science was prioritized.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.820
And because the state prioritized it

28:10.820 --> 28:13.500
through the propaganda machine, through the news and so on,

28:13.500 --> 28:16.180
it actually was really cool to be a scientist.

28:16.220 --> 28:18.020
Like you were highly valued in society,

28:18.020 --> 28:19.860
maybe that's a better way to say it.

28:19.860 --> 28:23.540
And I would say, you're saying like we have it easy now,

28:23.540 --> 28:27.660
in that sense, it was kind of beneficial

28:27.660 --> 28:29.140
to be a scientist in that society

28:29.140 --> 28:31.980
because you were seen as a hero as there's-

28:31.980 --> 28:34.140
Yes, Dolbych was hero of the Soviet Republic.

28:34.140 --> 28:37.100
And that, you know, there's positives to that.

28:37.100 --> 28:40.300
I mean, I'm not saying I would take the negatives

28:40.300 --> 28:41.140
to the positives,

28:41.140 --> 28:43.820
but it is interesting to see a world

28:43.820 --> 28:46.140
in which science was highly prized.

28:46.140 --> 28:49.540
In the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist,

28:49.540 --> 28:51.580
let's just say the American system,

28:51.580 --> 28:56.580
the celebrities are the athletes, the actors and actresses,

28:57.980 --> 29:01.100
maybe business leaders, musicians,

29:02.380 --> 29:03.860
and, you know, the people we elect

29:03.860 --> 29:07.820
are sort of lawyers and lawyers.

29:09.340 --> 29:12.300
So it's interesting to think of a world

29:12.300 --> 29:13.980
where science was highly prized,

29:13.980 --> 29:18.260
but they had to do that science within the constraints

29:18.260 --> 29:20.540
of always having big brother watching.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.300
It's- Yeah, the same in Germany.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.060
Germany had, you know, highly prized science.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.580
I mean, one of the most famous tragic to me cases

29:26.580 --> 29:29.820
is Fritz Haber, who invented the Haber-Bosch process

29:29.820 --> 29:31.820
that allowed us to, I don't know, have you eaten yet?

29:31.820 --> 29:33.820
You look, I mean, I know you fast,

29:33.820 --> 29:36.060
intermittent fast every day and you do that.

29:36.060 --> 29:38.500
You know, I said club and you got a little drool.

29:38.500 --> 29:41.460
But- He says I'm lifting and I look slim.

29:41.460 --> 29:42.700
This is amazing.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.580
I'm gonna clip this out and put it on Tinder.

29:44.580 --> 29:45.420
I think that's a website.

29:45.420 --> 29:48.420
You gotta swipe left or right for that, I don't know.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.300
But when you think about like, you know,

29:50.300 --> 29:52.780
what he did and created the fertilizer process

29:52.780 --> 29:55.460
that we all enjoy and we eat from every day,

29:56.260 --> 29:58.780
he was a German nationalist first and foremost,

29:58.780 --> 30:00.100
even though he was a Jew.

30:00.100 --> 30:02.300
And he personally went to witness the application

30:02.300 --> 30:05.340
of ammonia, chlorine gas applied during trench warfare

30:05.340 --> 30:08.540
in 1916 in battles in Brussels and whatever.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.900
And he was, they had a whole conjure of Nobel laureates

30:10.900 --> 30:12.820
in chemistry and physics, you know,

30:12.820 --> 30:14.500
that would go and witness these atrocities.

30:14.500 --> 30:18.620
But that was also, they were almost putting science above,

30:18.620 --> 30:19.820
I don't wanna say human dignity,

30:19.820 --> 30:23.660
but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.

30:23.660 --> 30:27.540
And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz

30:27.540 --> 30:30.060
because of the chemical that he invented also

30:30.060 --> 30:31.540
called Zyklon B.

30:31.540 --> 30:33.020
And so it's just unbelievable.

30:33.020 --> 30:36.100
So I feel like that does have resonance today

30:36.100 --> 30:38.700
in this worship of science, you know,

30:38.700 --> 30:41.300
and listen to science and follow the science,

30:41.300 --> 30:43.700
which is more like scientism.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.140
And there is still a danger.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.940
You know, I always say, just cause you're an atheist

30:47.940 --> 30:49.900
doesn't mean you don't have a religion, you know,

30:49.900 --> 30:52.900
just because you, you know, in my case, in my books,

30:52.900 --> 30:54.700
I talk a lot about the Nobel Prize.

30:54.700 --> 30:56.660
It's kind of like a kosher idol.

30:56.660 --> 30:58.420
It's something that you can worship, you know,

30:58.420 --> 30:59.420
it doesn't do any harm.

30:59.420 --> 31:02.380
And we want those people that are so significant

31:02.380 --> 31:03.700
in their intellectual accomplishments

31:03.700 --> 31:06.060
cause there is a core of America

31:06.060 --> 31:07.340
and the Western world in general

31:07.380 --> 31:10.100
that does worship and really look at science

31:10.100 --> 31:12.300
predominantly cause it gives us technology.

31:13.220 --> 31:14.860
But there's something really cool about that.

31:14.860 --> 31:17.380
And so for me, it's hard to find that balance point

31:17.380 --> 31:20.780
between looking to science for wisdom,

31:20.780 --> 31:23.580
which I don't think it has, they're two different words,

31:23.580 --> 31:27.060
but also recognizing how much good and transformative power

31:27.060 --> 31:29.020
maybe our only hope comes from science.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.700
You opened so many doors

31:32.700 --> 31:37.700
cause you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book.

31:38.860 --> 31:43.300
So there's a lot of elements of religiosity to science

31:43.300 --> 31:44.540
and to the Nobel Prize.

31:44.540 --> 31:48.340
It's fascinating to explore and we will,

31:48.340 --> 31:50.180
and we still haven't finished the discussion

31:50.180 --> 31:54.140
of the beginning of the universe, which we'll return to.

31:54.140 --> 31:57.460
But now, since you opened the book,

31:57.460 --> 32:01.460
wow, pun unintended of losing the Nobel Prize.

32:01.460 --> 32:04.460
Can you tell me the story of bicep,

32:04.460 --> 32:07.820
the background imaging of cosmic extragalactic

32:07.820 --> 32:11.460
polarization experiment, bicep one and bicep two,

32:11.460 --> 32:13.220
and then maybe you can talk about bicep three.

32:13.220 --> 32:16.380
But the thing that you cover in your book,

32:16.380 --> 32:18.780
the human story of it, what happened?

32:18.780 --> 32:21.740
Yeah, that book is in contradiction to the second book.

32:21.740 --> 32:22.740
That's like a memoir.

32:22.740 --> 32:26.660
It's really a description of what it's like to feel,

32:26.660 --> 32:28.900
what it feels like to be a scientist

32:28.900 --> 32:30.980
and to come up with the ignorance,

32:30.980 --> 32:33.540
uncertainty, imposter syndrome,

32:33.540 --> 32:35.940
which I cover in the later book in more detail,

32:35.940 --> 32:40.340
but to really feel like you're doing something

32:40.340 --> 32:43.620
and it's all you think about, it is all consuming.

32:43.620 --> 32:45.580
And it's something I couldn't have done now

32:45.580 --> 32:47.900
because I have too many other wonderful,

32:47.900 --> 32:50.140
delightful demands on my time.

32:50.140 --> 32:51.740
But to go back to that moment

32:51.740 --> 32:54.020
when I was first captivated by the night sky,

32:54.020 --> 32:56.180
I was a 12 year old, 13 year old,

32:56.180 --> 32:59.860
and really mixed together throughout my scientific story

32:59.860 --> 33:01.860
has always been wanting to approach

33:01.860 --> 33:03.100
the greatest mystery of all,

33:03.100 --> 33:06.060
which I think is the existence or non-existence of God.

33:06.060 --> 33:09.020
So I call myself a practicing agnostic.

33:09.020 --> 33:12.700
In other words, I do things that religious people do,

33:12.700 --> 33:16.180
and I don't do things that atheist people do.

33:16.180 --> 33:18.100
And I once had this conversation

33:18.100 --> 33:19.420
with my first podcast guest, actually.

33:19.420 --> 33:21.580
I shouldn't say, oh, I was just having a conversation

33:21.580 --> 33:24.260
with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.

33:24.260 --> 33:25.100
And I miss him.

33:25.100 --> 33:25.940
Namedrop.

33:25.940 --> 33:27.340
Namedrop, yes.

33:27.340 --> 33:30.060
I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of comments about him.

33:30.060 --> 33:31.580
In case people don't know,

33:31.580 --> 33:34.900
Brian Keating is the host of Into the Impossible podcast

33:34.900 --> 33:38.740
where he's talked to some of the greatest scientists

33:38.740 --> 33:40.300
in history of science,

33:40.300 --> 33:43.340
physicists especially in the history of science.

33:43.340 --> 33:45.220
So when I talked to Freeman, I said,

33:45.220 --> 33:47.700
Freeman, you call yourself an agnostic too.

33:47.700 --> 33:48.660
Can you tell me something like,

33:48.660 --> 33:50.900
what do you do on Sundays?

33:50.900 --> 33:51.980
Do you go to church?

33:51.980 --> 33:53.660
He's like, no, I don't go to church.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.580
And I'm like, well, imagine there was like

33:55.580 --> 33:58.140
an intelligent alien, and he was looking down,

33:58.140 --> 34:00.380
or she was, I don't know.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.700
Thing was looking down, and I saw Freeman.

34:02.700 --> 34:05.300
And on Sundays, like a group of people go to church,

34:05.300 --> 34:06.620
but Freeman doesn't go to church.

34:06.620 --> 34:07.700
And then there's another group of people

34:07.700 --> 34:10.240
that don't go to church, and those are called atheists.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.220
But Freeman calls himself an agnostic,

34:12.220 --> 34:14.140
but he does the things that like Richard Dawkins,

34:14.140 --> 34:15.980
he doesn't go to the same church

34:15.980 --> 34:18.300
that Richard Dawkins doesn't go to, right?

34:18.300 --> 34:19.940
So I said, how would you distinguish yourself

34:19.940 --> 34:20.860
if not practice?

34:20.860 --> 34:22.220
So I'm a behaviorist.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.820
I believe you can change your mentality.

34:23.820 --> 34:26.100
You can influence your mind,

34:26.100 --> 34:28.500
view your bodily physical actions.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.540
So when I was a 12-year-old, I got my first telescope.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.620
I was actually an altar boy in a Catholic church.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.500
It was kind of strange for a Jewish kid

34:34.500 --> 34:35.340
who grew up in New York.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.900
Maybe we'll get into that, maybe not.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.820
But I was just fascinated by these.

34:41.220 --> 34:42.980
Can we get into it for a second?

34:42.980 --> 34:45.180
Okay, yeah, all right, let's go.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.620
All right, let's go there.

34:46.620 --> 34:47.460
All right.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.140
Let's go to Baby Brian, or Young Brian.

34:51.140 --> 34:53.140
The new sitcom on CBS.

34:53.140 --> 34:55.820
Young Brian, born to two Jewish parents.

34:55.820 --> 34:58.140
My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.540
He was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.180
And my mother was an eminent mom

35:02.180 --> 35:06.660
and a brilliant English major, et cetera.

35:06.660 --> 35:08.180
And they raised, I thought they were secular.

35:08.180 --> 35:09.620
They, you know, we'd go to, I always joke,

35:09.620 --> 35:12.540
we'd go to synagogue, you know, two times a year

35:12.540 --> 35:14.140
on Christmas and Easter.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.940
Now, we would go, you know, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, right?

35:16.940 --> 35:19.540
That's the typical two-day-a-year Jews.

35:19.540 --> 35:21.620
And then, you know, we'd have matzahs

35:21.620 --> 35:23.340
once a year on Passover.

35:23.340 --> 35:24.420
And that was about it.

35:24.420 --> 35:26.420
And for years I was like that,

35:26.420 --> 35:28.180
until my parents got divorced.

35:28.180 --> 35:31.140
My mother remarried and she married an Irish Catholic man

35:31.140 --> 35:32.420
by the name of Ray Keating.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.420
My father's name is James X.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.820
So when she remarried Ray Keating,

35:37.820 --> 35:39.980
I was immediately adopted.

35:39.980 --> 35:42.420
I'm actually adopted into the Keating family.

35:42.420 --> 35:44.780
And he had nine brothers and sisters

35:44.780 --> 35:46.420
and just warm and gregarious.

35:46.420 --> 35:49.500
They, you know, did Christmas and Easter.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.540
It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.740
And I do things with great gusto.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.740
Whatever I do, I wanna take it all the way.

35:56.740 --> 36:00.140
So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity,

36:00.140 --> 36:01.300
in this case, Catholicism.

36:01.300 --> 36:03.140
So I was baptized, confirmed.

36:03.140 --> 36:05.540
And I said, I wanna go all the way.

36:05.540 --> 36:08.340
I became an altar boy in the Catholic Church.

36:08.340 --> 36:11.340
And you're gonna be the best altar boy there ever was.

36:11.340 --> 36:12.740
I had like serious skills.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.300
You passed that collection basket.

36:14.300 --> 36:18.540
I could push people and get them to do extra contributions.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.260
I was 13.

36:20.260 --> 36:23.380
I don't know if you remember, you know, when you were 13.

36:23.380 --> 36:25.740
But if you extrapolate the next level up, you know,

36:25.740 --> 36:28.220
it's like, you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.420
The next level up from, you know, confirmation,

36:30.420 --> 36:32.260
altar boy is priest.

36:32.260 --> 36:33.420
And I don't know if you're aware of this,

36:33.420 --> 36:37.540
but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.780
And as a 13 year old boy, kind of like future casting

36:40.780 --> 36:42.660
what life's gonna be like for myself

36:42.660 --> 36:46.580
if I continue on my path, I found it, maybe I-

36:46.620 --> 36:48.260
The math is not up.

36:48.260 --> 36:49.140
That's right.

36:49.140 --> 36:53.420
There was a serious gap in that future, in that future.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.380
And instead, when I should have been preparing

36:56.380 --> 36:58.660
for my Bar Mitzvah, you know, as most Jewish boys would be,

36:58.660 --> 37:01.540
a 12, 13 year old boy, I actually got a telescope

37:01.540 --> 37:04.180
and became infatuated with all the things

37:04.180 --> 37:05.020
you could see with it.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.340
It wasn't bigger than that one over there

37:06.340 --> 37:08.340
that your hedgehog's looking through.

37:08.340 --> 37:10.060
Is that hedgehog?

37:10.060 --> 37:13.140
It's a hedgehog, hedgehog in the fog.

37:13.140 --> 37:16.380
I should mention, and we'll go one by one these things.

37:16.380 --> 37:18.220
You've given me some incredible gifts.

37:18.220 --> 37:21.660
Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope

37:21.660 --> 37:24.700
that put some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look.

37:24.700 --> 37:25.660
And using-

37:25.660 --> 37:27.820
Now you're officially an experimental astrophysicist, but-

37:27.820 --> 37:30.100
Why experimentalist versus an engineer?

37:30.100 --> 37:33.140
Because you assembled this telescope, you gave it a mount

37:33.140 --> 37:35.180
and you connected it to a very powerful-

37:35.180 --> 37:36.540
Yeah, but there's no experiment going on.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.340
It's just engineering for show.

37:38.340 --> 37:39.180
It's very shallow.

37:39.180 --> 37:41.580
So experiment is taking it to the next level

37:41.580 --> 37:42.980
and actually achieving something.

37:42.980 --> 37:44.980
Here, I just built a thing for show.

37:44.980 --> 37:45.820
Well, that's always a joke.

37:46.020 --> 37:47.620
Oh, you're an experimental cosmologist.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.900
I'm like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.180
Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things,

37:52.180 --> 37:53.180
soldering things.

37:53.180 --> 37:55.460
It's not actually doing the stroking

37:55.460 --> 37:58.020
of my non-existent beard, contemplating the cyclic

37:58.020 --> 37:59.700
versus the bouncing cosmological model.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.420
Yeah, and just like most of robotics

38:02.420 --> 38:04.100
is just using Velcro for things.

38:04.100 --> 38:04.940
Right, yeah.

38:04.940 --> 38:07.620
It's not like having dancing dogs and whatever.

38:07.620 --> 38:08.460
So telescope.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.380
Yes, this telescope.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.380
What's the story of this little telescope?

38:11.380 --> 38:14.620
This telescope's a very precious thing in some ways.

38:14.620 --> 38:18.500
It's a symbol of what got me into,

38:18.500 --> 38:21.180
what brought me all the blessings I have in my life.

38:21.180 --> 38:22.380
Came from a telescope.

38:22.380 --> 38:26.500
And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.780
You right here, wherever we are,

38:28.780 --> 38:30.220
the biggest city on earth, Manhattan,

38:30.220 --> 38:31.740
where I was growing up as a 12-year-old

38:31.740 --> 38:33.420
outside of Manhattan.

38:33.420 --> 38:35.620
You can see the exact same craters on the moon,

38:35.620 --> 38:38.820
the same rings of Saturn, the same moons of Jupiter,

38:38.820 --> 38:40.300
the same phases of Venus.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.540
You can see the Andromeda Galaxy

38:42.780 --> 38:45.700
two and a half million light years away from earth.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.700
You can do that with that little thing over there.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.740
One that's a little more expensive.

38:48.740 --> 38:49.660
Get one that has a mount,

38:49.660 --> 38:52.260
and you can attach now your smartphone.

38:52.260 --> 38:53.100
What the hell is that?

38:53.100 --> 38:55.540
I wouldn't have known what that was in 1984.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.020
And with that, you can do something

38:57.020 --> 39:00.860
that no other science to my knowledge can really replicate.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.380
Maybe biology in some sense,

39:02.380 --> 39:06.700
but you can experience the physical sensation

39:06.700 --> 39:08.340
that Galileo experienced

39:08.340 --> 39:11.180
when he turned a telescope like that to Jupiter

39:11.180 --> 39:12.980
and saw these four dots around it.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.580
Or that Saturn had ears, as he called it.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.140
Or that the moon was not crystalline polished smooth

39:18.140 --> 39:20.540
and made of this heavenly substance,

39:20.540 --> 39:22.700
the quintessence substance, right?

39:22.700 --> 39:26.060
So where else can you be viscerally connected

39:26.060 --> 39:27.700
with the first person to ever make that discovery?

39:27.700 --> 39:29.580
Try doing that with the Higgs boson.

39:29.580 --> 39:32.620
Get yourself an LHC and smash together,

39:32.620 --> 39:34.540
high luminosity, call up Harry Cliff,

39:34.540 --> 39:36.180
and say, I wanna replicate.

39:36.180 --> 39:37.020
How did you feel?

39:37.020 --> 39:38.220
He didn't feel anything.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.260
None of them felt anything.

39:39.260 --> 39:40.700
It took years to come out.

39:40.740 --> 39:42.100
You can't do it.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.460
But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.460
That's fascinating.

39:45.460 --> 39:50.220
It's almost like maybe there's another one like that is fire.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.420
Like when you build a bonfire,

39:52.420 --> 39:53.660
like can you actually get it?

39:53.660 --> 39:55.020
See, if you use a lighter,

39:55.020 --> 39:58.100
I think if you actually, by rubbing sticks together,

39:58.100 --> 40:00.900
or however you do it without any of the modern tools,

40:00.900 --> 40:02.380
that's probably what that's like.

40:02.380 --> 40:04.900
And then you get to experience the magic of it,

40:04.900 --> 40:07.060
of what like early humans,

40:07.060 --> 40:07.900
almost safety instead.

40:07.900 --> 40:10.540
You feel what Og felt when he did it that first time.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.220
By the way, is this a gift?

40:12.220 --> 40:13.060
This is a gift, of course.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.180
You need a little bit of a swag upgrade,

40:15.180 --> 40:16.020
so I got you some gifts.

40:16.020 --> 40:16.860
I will, yeah.

40:16.860 --> 40:18.980
This is a, I'm pulling a Putin,

40:18.980 --> 40:21.260
like asked if this is a gift,

40:21.260 --> 40:24.340
making it very uncomfortable for you to say.

40:24.340 --> 40:25.180
Not really.

40:25.180 --> 40:28.100
This is actually my childhood telescope here.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.460
But now I'm keeping it.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.300
That's great.

40:30.300 --> 40:32.180
So looking through this telescope.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.740
Was when your love for science was first born.

40:34.740 --> 40:35.580
Changed my life.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.380
Because not only was I doing that,

40:37.380 --> 40:39.460
I was replicating what Galileo did,

40:39.460 --> 40:40.860
but I was, and I'll get,

40:40.860 --> 40:43.700
I'm 100% not comparing myself to Galileo Galileo, okay?

40:43.700 --> 40:45.180
If there's any confusion out there.

40:45.180 --> 40:47.260
But I did replicate exactly what he did.

40:47.260 --> 40:48.780
And I was like, holy crap, this is weird.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.220
Let me write it down.

40:50.220 --> 40:51.340
So it had another effect,

40:51.340 --> 40:52.540
which all good scientists,

40:52.540 --> 40:53.540
budding scientists should do,

40:53.540 --> 40:55.140
and all parents should do.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.060
Get your kid a book, a little notebook.

40:57.060 --> 40:58.500
Tape a pencil to it.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.780
Write down what you see,

40:59.780 --> 41:01.020
what you hypothesize,

41:01.020 --> 41:02.020
what you think it's gonna be.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.500
Not like in the high school,

41:03.500 --> 41:05.860
you know, like hypothesis, thesis.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.940
But just like, wow, how did I feel?

41:07.940 --> 41:10.220
Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.

41:10.220 --> 41:11.700
Sketch what you see.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.180
The Lagoon Nebula.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.860
The Pleiades Seven Sisters.

41:14.860 --> 41:16.940
You can see them anywhere on earth.

41:16.940 --> 41:18.420
And when you do that, again,

41:18.420 --> 41:20.980
you're connecting two different hemispheres of your brain,

41:20.980 --> 41:22.180
as I understand it.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.700
And you're connecting them through your fingertips.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.060
You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips,

41:27.060 --> 41:30.180
in your connection between what you see,

41:30.180 --> 41:31.900
what you observe, and what you write down.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.700
Then you do research, right?

41:34.700 --> 41:36.420
The goal of science is not to just replicate

41:36.420 --> 41:38.660
what other people did is do something new.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.420
And that's what we call it research

41:40.420 --> 41:43.020
and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.

41:43.020 --> 41:47.380
And in so doing, you start to train a kid at age 12 or 13

41:47.380 --> 41:48.820
for 50 bucks.

41:48.820 --> 41:49.660
It's unbelievable.

41:49.660 --> 41:50.740
And now we can do even better

41:50.740 --> 41:53.060
because you got to share it on Instagram or whatever.

41:53.060 --> 41:56.100
And you can, by doing so, have an entree

41:56.100 --> 41:57.740
into the world of what does it really mean

41:57.740 --> 42:00.020
to be a scientist and do so viscerally.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.980
You know, I often say,

42:01.980 --> 42:04.140
I was taught this by my English teacher,

42:04.140 --> 42:05.900
Mrs. Tompkins in ninth grade,

42:05.900 --> 42:09.620
that the word educate, it doesn't mean to pour into.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.340
Let me pour in some facts, intellects,

42:11.340 --> 42:12.820
and you know, it's not like machine learning

42:12.820 --> 42:14.780
that you're just showing like billions of cats or,

42:14.780 --> 42:16.580
you know, you're not like forcing it in,

42:16.580 --> 42:17.620
you're bringing it out.

42:17.620 --> 42:20.260
It means to pour out of, in Latin, educare.

42:20.260 --> 42:22.860
And what more could a teacher want

42:22.860 --> 42:25.100
than to have something that the kid is just like gushing?

42:25.100 --> 42:25.940
No, you're not gonna see like-

42:25.940 --> 42:26.980
To inspire the kid.

42:26.980 --> 42:28.180
Yes. Inspire.

42:28.180 --> 42:29.660
Yes. Shout out to Mrs. Tompkins.

42:29.660 --> 42:31.420
Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins, she's watching, yeah.

42:31.420 --> 42:32.380
She's a big fan.

42:33.900 --> 42:35.180
Me, she doesn't care for, but you.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.980
Yeah, excellent.

42:36.980 --> 42:39.620
We take those we love for granted.

42:39.620 --> 42:40.980
This is in Manhattan.

42:40.980 --> 42:42.340
This is in Westchester County, New York.

42:42.340 --> 42:43.380
Okay, got it.

42:43.380 --> 42:46.300
So, okay, so, but then that's where the dream is born.

42:46.300 --> 42:47.140
Yeah.

42:47.140 --> 42:51.620
But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.

42:51.620 --> 42:56.620
So going to university, graduate school, post-doc,

42:56.660 --> 42:58.300
all the way to where you are today.

42:58.300 --> 43:03.220
What's that, what are some notable moments in that journey?

43:03.220 --> 43:05.620
So I call that the academic hunger games.

43:05.620 --> 43:07.780
You know, cause it's like you're competing against

43:07.780 --> 43:09.500
like these people, you know,

43:09.500 --> 43:11.540
who are just getting smarter all the time

43:11.540 --> 43:13.380
as you're getting smarter all the time.

43:13.380 --> 43:16.420
They wanna get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.

43:16.420 --> 43:18.380
Like there's fewer slots to get into college

43:18.380 --> 43:19.460
than in high school.

43:19.460 --> 43:20.940
There's fewer slots in graduate school.

43:20.940 --> 43:23.420
There's fewer, very fewer slots to be a post-doc.

43:23.420 --> 43:26.420
And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.

43:26.420 --> 43:29.260
You know, we just did a faculty search at UC San Diego.

43:29.260 --> 43:31.340
400 applicants for one position.

43:31.340 --> 43:32.700
It's almost getting impossible.

43:32.700 --> 43:34.900
Like I almost can't conceive of doing

43:34.900 --> 43:36.820
what these new brilliant young people

43:36.820 --> 43:38.700
applying to become an assistant professor

43:38.700 --> 43:40.740
at a state university that they're doing.

43:40.740 --> 43:42.940
It takes so much courage to do that.

43:42.940 --> 43:45.700
So I went from, you know, this kid in New York

43:45.700 --> 43:48.580
thinking I would never be a professional astronomer.

43:48.580 --> 43:50.940
A, because I didn't know any, I'd never seen any.

43:50.940 --> 43:52.620
I didn't even know that they existed.

43:52.620 --> 43:53.980
And I thought, who the hell is gonna pay me

43:53.980 --> 43:54.980
to look at the stars?

43:54.980 --> 43:57.300
Like, won't they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?

43:57.300 --> 43:59.300
Like, it's just not something I could conceive

43:59.300 --> 44:00.140
of getting paid to do.

44:00.140 --> 44:01.620
Even if I had the brilliance to do it,

44:01.620 --> 44:02.980
which I didn't feel I did.

44:03.860 --> 44:05.860
And then I went to graduate school.

44:05.860 --> 44:10.420
And during graduate school, I had this kind of

44:10.420 --> 44:12.860
on again, off again relationship with my father.

44:12.860 --> 44:14.540
And I knew that he was a mathematician.

44:14.540 --> 44:16.460
He had left and gotten remarried himself

44:16.460 --> 44:17.380
and moved across the country.

44:17.380 --> 44:19.620
I didn't see him for 15 years.

44:19.620 --> 44:22.140
And in that time, I learned a lot about him.

44:22.140 --> 44:24.020
And I learned that he had gotten very interested,

44:24.020 --> 44:25.220
not in pure mathematics,

44:25.220 --> 44:26.660
which he had been a number theorist

44:26.660 --> 44:30.380
and contributed seminal work on the D'Aufentine equations,

44:30.380 --> 44:33.180
which play a role in Turing's work that you may have seen.

44:33.180 --> 44:35.660
But anyway, he had become interested,

44:35.660 --> 44:37.060
turned completely away from that

44:37.060 --> 44:39.460
into the foundations of quantum mechanics and relativity,

44:39.460 --> 44:40.300
which is physics.

44:40.300 --> 44:42.260
And by that time I was at Brown University

44:42.260 --> 44:43.500
and I was thinking,

44:43.500 --> 44:45.660
oh, maybe I'll be condensed matter physicist

44:45.660 --> 44:46.660
or experimentalist.

44:46.660 --> 44:47.820
I never thought I'd be a theorist

44:47.820 --> 44:51.020
and I'm not a theorist, so it was pretty prescient.

44:51.020 --> 44:53.180
And, but it always appealed to me,

44:53.180 --> 44:55.500
like, why not do what made me happy as a 12 year old?

44:55.500 --> 44:59.220
Like, we often forget about like those primitive things

44:59.260 --> 45:01.460
that impound us are probably the most sustainable,

45:01.460 --> 45:04.260
durable and resilient attributes of our character.

45:04.260 --> 45:05.420
So with my own kids,

45:05.420 --> 45:07.340
like what are they interested in now when they're young?

45:07.340 --> 45:08.860
And it doesn't mean that's what they're gonna do.

45:08.860 --> 45:10.660
I mean, some of them wanna play Fortnite,

45:10.660 --> 45:13.100
like professional Fortnite play, which there are,

45:13.100 --> 45:15.020
but the odds of that is less

45:15.020 --> 45:16.100
than the odds of being a professor.

45:16.100 --> 45:19.340
Can I ask you, is your father still with us?

45:19.340 --> 45:20.180
No.

45:21.620 --> 45:25.860
Just in a small tangent, do you miss him?

45:25.860 --> 45:27.300
Do you think about him?

45:27.300 --> 45:30.940
Does his mathematical journey reverberate

45:30.940 --> 45:32.100
through who you are?

45:32.100 --> 45:33.220
Oh yeah, absolutely.

45:33.220 --> 45:35.860
I mean, it did in very many ways.

45:35.860 --> 45:37.900
And he's been gone for a long time now.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.660
Thinking back to that time with him,

45:40.660 --> 45:43.860
he must've instilled some capacity for me

45:43.860 --> 45:46.980
to only wanna spend my time, which is a limited quantity.

45:46.980 --> 45:48.380
I don't think it's the most limited quantity.

45:48.380 --> 45:49.580
Maybe we'll talk about that later.

45:49.580 --> 45:53.620
But to go into only the most challenging,

45:53.620 --> 45:55.900
interesting things with the limited time

45:55.900 --> 45:57.100
that we have while we're alive.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.740
And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.

45:59.740 --> 46:02.620
For me, it was the foundations of the universe

46:02.620 --> 46:03.780
and how did it come to be?

46:03.780 --> 46:05.540
And I felt like, well, people have been trying

46:05.540 --> 46:07.260
since Einstein to outdo Einstein,

46:07.260 --> 46:09.020
really have made great progress

46:09.020 --> 46:10.900
in the foundations of quantum mechanics.

46:10.900 --> 46:12.660
But this is an exciting time.

46:12.660 --> 46:15.100
The COBE satellite had just released its data

46:15.100 --> 46:17.540
that the universe had this anisotropy pattern.

46:17.540 --> 46:20.140
Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God

46:20.140 --> 46:21.700
and so forth.

46:21.700 --> 46:23.740
And so it seemed like this is a good golden age

46:23.740 --> 46:26.420
for what I'm gonna do and what I'm most interested in.

46:26.420 --> 46:29.220
But always throughout that, I wanted to understand,

46:29.220 --> 46:30.460
I didn't wanna be a wrench monkey.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.100
No offense to people that just do experiment.

46:33.100 --> 46:34.300
And no offense to monkeys.

46:34.300 --> 46:35.740
No offense to monkeys, that's right.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.780
This little guy, sorry, man.

46:37.780 --> 46:40.620
But thinking back to what animates me,

46:40.620 --> 46:43.300
it's not doing the engineering as much as it is

46:43.300 --> 46:45.380
getting the data, but there's a lot of steps.

46:45.380 --> 46:48.420
I wanna be the guy understanding

46:48.420 --> 46:51.980
what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.

46:51.980 --> 46:54.260
So I always joke with my theorist friends,

46:54.260 --> 46:56.340
call me a closeted theorist.

46:57.300 --> 47:00.500
You know what they call a guy who hangs out with musicians?

47:00.500 --> 47:01.420
A drummer.

47:01.420 --> 47:04.100
So I wanna be like that for physics, right?

47:04.100 --> 47:04.980
For theoretical physics.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.060
I wanna be like the guy, doesn't do new theory,

47:07.060 --> 47:09.260
but understands the theory that the new theorists are doing.

47:09.260 --> 47:12.580
I love that formulation of a theorist

47:12.580 --> 47:17.340
is understanding the source of the signal you're getting.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.020
Like signal is primary.

47:19.020 --> 47:22.460
Like the thing you measure is primary

47:22.460 --> 47:26.700
and theory is just the search of explaining

47:28.260 --> 47:31.860
how that signal originated, but it's all about the signal.

47:31.860 --> 47:34.260
I mean, I see the same search for the human mind

47:34.260 --> 47:37.980
and like neuroscience in that same kind of way.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.940
It's ultimately about the signal,

47:39.940 --> 47:42.540
but you kind of hope to understand

47:42.540 --> 47:43.900
how that signal originated.

47:43.900 --> 47:45.140
That's fascinating.

47:45.140 --> 47:50.140
That's such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics

47:52.940 --> 47:54.860
because it ultimately at the end of the day

47:54.860 --> 47:57.420
is all about the signal.

47:57.420 --> 47:58.460
Yeah.

47:58.460 --> 48:00.180
Yeah, and maybe those two things,

48:00.180 --> 48:02.580
the neuroscience and the cosmos,

48:02.580 --> 48:04.700
not getting too romantic, but yeah,

48:04.700 --> 48:07.300
maybe they're linked in some fundamental way.

48:07.300 --> 48:10.660
Some fundamental conscious, cosmic consciousness, but-

48:10.660 --> 48:11.660
We're gonna get to that.

48:11.660 --> 48:14.540
Yeah, no, we definitely have to get to that.

48:14.540 --> 48:16.700
But getting back to, yeah, so my origins,

48:16.700 --> 48:18.620
so I always say like, and I wanna try this on you.

48:18.620 --> 48:20.220
You said you wouldn't answer any of my questions,

48:20.220 --> 48:21.300
but I'm gonna ask you some questions.

48:21.300 --> 48:23.020
What's the most important day on the calendar?

48:23.020 --> 48:24.540
Don't tell me the date, but to you,

48:24.540 --> 48:27.980
what's the most important day to you every year?

48:27.980 --> 48:29.580
Do I have to answer or do I have to think about that?

48:29.580 --> 48:31.220
No, no, answer, like you don't have to tell me

48:31.220 --> 48:32.340
the exact date of the calendar.

48:32.340 --> 48:35.380
It could be like your mistress's birthday or whatever, but-

48:35.380 --> 48:39.140
I have so many I lose track, even though I'm single.

48:39.140 --> 48:40.380
How does that even make sense?

48:40.380 --> 48:41.220
I know.

48:41.220 --> 48:42.180
Okay, I'm sorry.

48:42.180 --> 48:46.220
So a day, like a month and a day, yeah.

48:46.220 --> 48:49.540
I mean, for me it would be December 31st.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.260
Yeah, so I was gonna say New Year's Eve,

48:52.220 --> 48:53.420
New Year's Day, some people say birthday,

48:53.420 --> 48:54.900
anniversary, kid's birth.

48:54.900 --> 48:58.220
They're usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?

48:58.220 --> 49:00.420
January means the portal between,

49:00.420 --> 49:02.700
the God was the portal between the beginning and the end.

49:02.700 --> 49:05.100
So you're looking back maybe because you're Russian,

49:05.100 --> 49:07.420
like the death side, the light side looking forward

49:07.420 --> 49:09.180
into January, the beginning, right?

49:10.220 --> 49:14.020
So everybody's most important day

49:14.020 --> 49:17.260
is usually some beginning or something significant.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.260
For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all,

49:19.340 --> 49:21.940
like when did the universe get born, as I said before.

49:21.940 --> 49:25.540
And I didn't think there, again, I didn't, I just,

49:25.540 --> 49:27.180
there was some mental obstruction

49:27.180 --> 49:30.540
that I didn't realize that I could get past

49:30.540 --> 49:32.700
because I didn't think like anybody does it.

49:32.700 --> 49:34.820
Like I knew astronomers knew these answers,

49:34.820 --> 49:36.140
like the universe at that time,

49:36.140 --> 49:38.140
between 10 and 20 billion years old.

49:38.140 --> 49:41.740
Now we know it's 13.872 billion years old.

49:41.740 --> 49:43.500
It's incredible the five digit, you know,

49:43.500 --> 49:44.340
for significant-

49:44.340 --> 49:45.180
What is it again?

49:45.180 --> 49:46.020
13.-

49:46.020 --> 49:48.940
13.872 billion years.

49:48.980 --> 49:50.900
870 million.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.940
So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?

49:52.940 --> 49:54.220
Is it, what are the air bars on that?

49:54.220 --> 49:55.300
For me, I'm 50.

49:55.300 --> 49:57.340
So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me

49:57.340 --> 49:59.540
and telling me within 12 hours how old I am.

49:59.540 --> 50:00.380
Yeah.

50:00.380 --> 50:02.500
So half a percent level accuracy.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.060
There's a confidence behind that?

50:04.060 --> 50:05.420
Oh yeah, I mean, there's this significance.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.140
Yeah, no, it's extremely well-measured.

50:07.140 --> 50:09.140
I mean, it's one of the most precise things that we have.

50:09.140 --> 50:12.340
In contrast to, again, 25 years ago,

50:12.340 --> 50:14.620
we didn't know if the universe was 10 billion

50:14.620 --> 50:16.060
or 20 billion years old,

50:16.060 --> 50:18.060
but there were stars in our galaxy

50:18.060 --> 50:19.580
that were believed to be, as they are,

50:19.580 --> 50:21.100
about 12 billion years old,

50:21.100 --> 50:22.660
or in the universe that were 12 billion.

50:22.660 --> 50:26.700
So that would be like you being older than your father.

50:26.700 --> 50:27.980
It was embarrassing.

50:27.980 --> 50:30.740
Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent on a tangent

50:30.740 --> 50:31.820
on a tangent?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.420
How old is the universe?

50:33.420 --> 50:35.980
Can you dig in onto this number?

50:35.980 --> 50:38.540
How do we know currently with those,

50:38.540 --> 50:40.460
I guess you said four or five-

50:40.460 --> 50:41.500
Significant figures, yeah.

50:41.500 --> 50:42.740
Significant digits.

50:42.740 --> 50:44.900
So we can come about it from two different ways.

50:44.900 --> 50:47.940
One, basically they rely on the most important number

50:47.940 --> 50:50.300
in cosmology, which is called the Hubble constant.

50:50.300 --> 50:52.700
The Hubble constant is this weird number

50:52.700 --> 50:54.180
that has the following units.

50:54.180 --> 50:58.340
It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.

50:58.340 --> 51:00.380
So it's a speed per distance,

51:00.380 --> 51:02.900
which means you multiply it by distance and you get a speed.

51:02.900 --> 51:04.300
And what is the speed you're measuring?

51:04.300 --> 51:06.180
Well, you're measuring the speed of a distant galaxy

51:06.180 --> 51:07.940
at many megaparsecs away.

51:07.940 --> 51:09.620
So a galaxy at one megaparsec away.

51:09.620 --> 51:10.900
This isn't actually strictly true

51:10.900 --> 51:12.940
because of local gravitational effects.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.500
But if you go out, say one megaparsec away,

51:15.500 --> 51:17.860
you would say that that galaxy's moving 72 kilometers

51:17.860 --> 51:19.180
per second away from you.

51:19.180 --> 51:21.660
And every galaxy, except for the local,

51:21.660 --> 51:23.500
very most local group surrounding us,

51:23.500 --> 51:25.260
maybe a half a dozen galaxies,

51:25.260 --> 51:30.260
out of 500 billion galaxies to perhaps a trillion galaxies.

51:32.740 --> 51:35.900
So 12 out of that number are moving towards us.

51:35.900 --> 51:37.580
The rest are moving away from us.

51:37.580 --> 51:40.620
So that number, if you invert it,

51:40.620 --> 51:43.420
if you say, well, when did those things last touch each other?

51:43.420 --> 51:44.300
All those galaxies.

51:44.300 --> 51:45.820
Now they're really far apart.

51:45.820 --> 51:47.140
We know how fast they're moving away.

51:47.140 --> 51:49.100
It's a very simple algebra problem to solve.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.260
When were they touching?

51:50.260 --> 51:52.020
That's where you get that number from.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.420
So there's the local 12 and then the rest.

51:54.420 --> 51:55.260
Ignore the 12, yeah.

51:55.260 --> 51:57.260
And then ignore the 12 and then look at the others

51:57.260 --> 51:59.580
and yeah, then solve the algebra problem.

52:01.060 --> 52:04.020
How does the stuff in the beginning,

52:04.020 --> 52:05.660
the mystery of that beginning epoch

52:05.660 --> 52:07.460
change this calculation of-

52:07.460 --> 52:10.860
Very little because actually we understand

52:10.860 --> 52:12.860
how there's some other ingredients that go into it,

52:12.860 --> 52:14.900
namely how much dark energy there is in the universe,

52:14.900 --> 52:16.460
how much dark matter there is in the universe,

52:16.460 --> 52:19.980
how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera there are,

52:19.980 --> 52:22.140
and how much ordinary matter like we're made up of.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.700
Neutrons, protons, croutons.

52:24.700 --> 52:25.540
Okay, so the-

52:28.260 --> 52:29.100
Morons.

52:31.340 --> 52:36.340
It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.

52:37.540 --> 52:38.700
How does that make sense?

52:38.700 --> 52:40.500
Oh, yeah, so you're talking about the fact

52:40.500 --> 52:43.940
that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe

52:43.940 --> 52:46.820
that's located at a distance that is farther

52:46.820 --> 52:49.780
than the speed of light times the age of the universe.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.620
Naively, you would say that the, you know.

52:51.620 --> 52:54.660
So you're right, if the universe were static,

52:54.660 --> 52:56.260
if the universe came into existence,

52:56.260 --> 52:57.540
and you can conceive of this,

52:57.540 --> 53:00.500
the universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe,

53:00.500 --> 53:02.740
so the universe just started off,

53:02.740 --> 53:04.500
those galaxies were, you know,

53:04.500 --> 53:07.740
they could be moving towards us, away from us, who knows,

53:07.740 --> 53:09.980
that you could say, I can see a galaxy

53:09.980 --> 53:13.780
that's at a distance of only 13.8 billion years

53:13.780 --> 53:15.940
times the speed of light, that would be true.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.380
But the fact that the light is expanding

53:18.380 --> 53:20.460
along with the expansion of the universe,

53:20.460 --> 53:23.180
so imagine there was some very distant past,

53:23.180 --> 53:25.980
we were near a galaxy, it's gonna produce some light,

53:25.980 --> 53:28.340
and that galaxy is going to be moving away from us,

53:28.340 --> 53:30.420
the light's gonna be getting more and more red-shifted

53:30.420 --> 53:31.980
as it's called, and it's gonna be moving

53:31.980 --> 53:34.860
farther and farther away from us as time goes on,

53:34.860 --> 53:35.940
there'll be some acceleration

53:35.940 --> 53:37.860
as we get into the era of dark energy.

53:38.700 --> 53:41.620
The light signals, there'll be some cone of acceptance,

53:41.620 --> 53:45.180
if you will, from which, which represents all the events

53:45.180 --> 53:47.700
that we could have received information from.

53:47.700 --> 53:50.900
We can't currently communicate with that galaxy.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.500
It sent us some light, and now it's moving away,

53:53.500 --> 53:55.460
and it sent us some light, and because the space

53:55.460 --> 53:57.860
is also dragging the photons with it, if you like,

53:57.860 --> 53:59.820
the photons are being, participating

53:59.820 --> 54:01.100
in the expansion of the universe,

54:01.100 --> 54:02.500
that's why they're red-shifting,

54:02.500 --> 54:05.260
that we can see things out to where the universe

54:05.260 --> 54:09.220
first began expanding, not just when it began existing,

54:09.220 --> 54:10.700
and because the universe has been expanding

54:10.700 --> 54:14.100
for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing down yet,

54:14.100 --> 54:18.060
which is a huge surprise, serendipitous surprise,

54:18.060 --> 54:20.300
that we can see things approximately three times

54:20.300 --> 54:22.100
the age of the universe away from us,

54:22.100 --> 54:24.060
so we can see that it's called the age of the universe,

54:24.060 --> 54:26.220
15 billion years, just to make the math simple,

54:26.220 --> 54:29.620
we see things at 45 billion light-years distance

54:29.620 --> 54:31.580
in that direction, and we see things

54:31.580 --> 54:34.220
at 45 billion light-years in that direction,

54:34.260 --> 54:36.860
just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away,

54:36.860 --> 54:39.340
so that means we see things that themselves

54:39.340 --> 54:42.540
are 90 billion light-years away from each other.

54:42.540 --> 54:45.340
That's sort of the diameter of the observable universe.

54:45.340 --> 54:47.100
Is there another universe beyond that?

54:47.100 --> 54:49.660
We don't know, so in conjecture, there's not only one,

54:49.660 --> 54:51.300
there's an infinite number of them.

54:51.300 --> 54:54.340
How are you emotionally okay with the fact

54:54.340 --> 54:56.780
that our universe is expanding, so like?

54:56.780 --> 54:59.700
It's gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvy Singer.

54:59.700 --> 55:02.620
No, I grew up in the Soviet Union.

55:02.620 --> 55:03.660
We watched propaganda.

55:03.660 --> 55:05.460
I realized that you did, yes.

55:05.460 --> 55:06.300
So there's a face of Annie Hall.

55:06.300 --> 55:08.140
Annie Hall, is that some kind of, what is the?

55:08.140 --> 55:11.740
I mean, it's part of the propagandist movie

55:11.740 --> 55:13.860
with Woody Allen, certainly canceled,

55:13.860 --> 55:17.700
but nevertheless, back when he was not canceled yet,

55:17.700 --> 55:19.100
he made a movie called Annie Hall,

55:19.100 --> 55:21.860
in which as a self-depiction, he's like a Larry David,

55:21.860 --> 55:24.460
before Larry David was Larry David, neurotic,

55:24.460 --> 55:27.340
typical neurotic young Jew, he's in Brooklyn,

55:27.340 --> 55:28.820
and he all of a sudden tells his mother

55:28.820 --> 55:29.980
he's not doing his homework anymore.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.380
He refuses to do his homework.

55:31.380 --> 55:32.420
His mother says, why?

55:32.580 --> 55:34.060
Because the universe is expanding,

55:34.060 --> 55:36.220
and it keeps on expanding.

55:36.220 --> 55:37.140
Everything will rip apart,

55:37.140 --> 55:39.020
and no, we'll never have anything in contact,

55:39.020 --> 55:40.460
and everything is meaningless.

55:40.460 --> 55:43.180
I assume these are some of the topics we're gonna get to.

55:43.180 --> 55:45.660
And she goes, what are you talking about?

55:45.660 --> 55:46.820
We're in Brooklyn.

55:46.820 --> 55:49.140
Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:49.140 --> 55:50.860
And that's true, Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:50.860 --> 55:52.700
The solar system is not expanding.

55:52.700 --> 55:53.620
Often times, they get asked,

55:53.620 --> 55:55.540
what is the universe expanding into?

55:55.540 --> 55:57.380
That's one of my favorite questions.

55:57.380 --> 55:59.060
What is it expanding into?

55:59.060 --> 56:00.980
And I say, it's actually an easy question,

56:00.980 --> 56:02.380
if you think about it.

56:03.340 --> 56:05.500
You've seen your friend, Elon, he goes out into space,

56:05.500 --> 56:06.340
he's got a rocket, right?

56:06.340 --> 56:08.620
What's outside of the rocket?

56:08.620 --> 56:10.740
If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle,

56:10.740 --> 56:13.660
take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,

56:13.660 --> 56:16.780
sip in some Tang, screw on the cover of it,

56:16.780 --> 56:17.620
what's in there?

56:18.940 --> 56:19.780
Is it empty?

56:21.260 --> 56:23.020
That's just semantics, I guess.

56:25.020 --> 56:25.860
Yeah.

56:25.860 --> 56:26.700
No, it's definitely not empty.

56:26.700 --> 56:28.380
So you step outside the rocket?

56:28.380 --> 56:30.140
Yeah, you're in the vacuum of space,

56:30.140 --> 56:31.340
the quote unquote vacuum of space.

56:31.780 --> 56:32.620
There's no more liquid in it.

56:32.620 --> 56:34.660
No, it's just a container, one cubic centimeter.

56:34.660 --> 56:35.860
Let's just make it simple.

56:35.860 --> 56:38.180
One cubic centimeter of a box,

56:38.180 --> 56:40.820
and you take it out into space outside the Falcon,

56:40.820 --> 56:41.660
whatever, right?

56:42.700 --> 56:44.020
What's inside that box?

56:44.020 --> 56:45.100
It's not empty.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.340
There's actually, I'm gonna say,

56:47.340 --> 56:48.460
this is gonna set your friends up.

56:48.460 --> 56:53.140
There's 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements

56:53.140 --> 56:54.900
that we call the cosmic microwave background

56:54.900 --> 56:56.580
inside that box at any second.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.500
Okay, all right, hold on a second.

56:58.500 --> 57:03.340
What, 420, that's, I've heard of that number before.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.180
All right, let's-

57:04.180 --> 57:06.780
It used to be 69, but then they changed it.

57:06.780 --> 57:09.300
Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.940
In a millimeter box, it's 69.

57:10.940 --> 57:12.740
What are we talking about here?

57:12.740 --> 57:16.460
What's in the box?

57:16.460 --> 57:18.020
I'm gonna get, that's right.

57:18.020 --> 57:19.060
Let's think outside the box.

57:19.060 --> 57:20.220
No, we're thinking inside the box.

57:20.220 --> 57:22.380
So if you have, every cubic centimeter

57:22.380 --> 57:25.340
of our observable universe is suffused with heat

57:25.340 --> 57:28.540
left over from the Big Bang, dark matter particles.

57:28.540 --> 57:30.940
There's a little ordinary matter in the universe,

57:31.900 --> 57:33.060
and every cubic centimeter,

57:33.060 --> 57:34.740
there's some probability to find a proton,

57:34.740 --> 57:37.620
a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.

57:37.620 --> 57:39.700
There's actually an awful lot of neutrinos

57:39.700 --> 57:41.340
inside of that cubic centimeter.

57:41.340 --> 57:43.060
Now, just imagine how many cubic centimeters

57:43.060 --> 57:44.060
there are in the universe.

57:44.060 --> 57:44.900
It's enormous.

57:44.900 --> 57:46.660
That's why there's enormous numbers of particles

57:46.660 --> 57:47.500
in our universe.

57:47.500 --> 57:48.940
It's a very rich universe.

57:48.940 --> 57:51.180
But now let's zoom in on that box.

57:51.180 --> 57:54.020
So now, inside that box, there might be one,

57:54.220 --> 57:56.220
let's say there might be one ordinary matter,

57:56.220 --> 57:59.980
like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.

57:59.980 --> 58:03.140
There might be a couple hundred neutrinos,

58:03.140 --> 58:06.980
and there'll be a couple hundred photons, as I said, 420.

58:06.980 --> 58:08.500
What's between those guys?

58:09.780 --> 58:13.100
What's between the protons and the neutrinos

58:13.100 --> 58:14.220
and the photons?

58:14.220 --> 58:17.060
Just zoom into a cubic micron now.

58:17.060 --> 58:19.380
Imagine 420 things inside a box this big.

58:19.380 --> 58:20.940
It's actually pretty empty.

58:20.940 --> 58:22.380
They're just zipping around in there, right?

58:22.420 --> 58:24.500
So between them, there's a lot of empty space.

58:24.500 --> 58:27.940
And this is outside the kind of physics-based models

58:27.940 --> 58:29.580
of fields and all those kinds of things.

58:29.580 --> 58:33.940
Just asking the question of what is this emptiness?

58:33.940 --> 58:35.860
Particle content in the universe,

58:35.860 --> 58:38.460
in every cubic centimeter of the universe.

58:38.460 --> 58:39.700
Outside of the 420.

58:39.700 --> 58:44.500
So you have the 420, they have some mass.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.340
Oh, they have the energy.

58:45.340 --> 58:46.160
They don't have mass.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.000
Photons don't have mass.

58:47.000 --> 58:47.840
Energy for mass.

58:47.840 --> 58:48.660
That's why they don't bring suitcases.

58:48.660 --> 58:50.100
You know that's true, right?

58:50.100 --> 58:53.060
Photons never bring suitcases with you, with them,

58:53.060 --> 58:55.180
because they're traveling light.

58:55.180 --> 58:57.500
See, I don't even get a laugh out of you.

58:57.500 --> 58:58.340
Corny dad jokes.

58:58.340 --> 58:59.620
Okay, you'll appreciate something.

58:59.620 --> 59:01.500
No, this is pretty good.

59:01.500 --> 59:02.900
I'm laughing on the insides.

59:02.900 --> 59:03.900
What's in the box?

59:03.900 --> 59:04.820
What's the 420?

59:04.820 --> 59:07.420
What's between the photons?

59:07.420 --> 59:08.460
That's what space is.

59:08.460 --> 59:10.340
That's what the universe is expanding into.

59:10.340 --> 59:13.700
Okay, so that's the notebook

59:13.700 --> 59:16.260
on which the photons are written.

59:16.260 --> 59:17.100
That's beautiful.

59:17.100 --> 59:19.460
But still, thank you.

59:19.540 --> 59:22.900
Still, I understand this,

59:22.900 --> 59:26.620
but it's still uncomfortable that if the universe

59:26.620 --> 59:29.620
is expanding, that this thing is expanding.

59:29.620 --> 59:31.500
The canvas is expanding.

59:31.500 --> 59:33.220
It's very strange.

59:33.220 --> 59:35.260
Because if we were just sitting there still,

59:35.260 --> 59:37.720
I guess if we're in Brooklyn, nothing's expanding.

59:37.720 --> 59:41.900
So our cognition, our intuition about the world

59:41.900 --> 59:46.500
is based on this local fact that we don't get to experience

59:47.820 --> 59:49.140
this kind of expansion.

59:50.140 --> 59:52.420
And that intuition leads us astray.

59:52.420 --> 59:54.420
But you know that gravity is the weakest

59:54.420 --> 59:56.420
of the so-called four fundamental forces.

59:57.340 --> 01:00:00.020
And yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.340
Gravity is, we're being pulled towards the Andromeda galaxy

01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.340
at some enormous rate of speed

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.820
because of its massive counter gravitational force

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.700
to the force we exert on it.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.700
So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.700
And because of that, we can think about these effects

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.940
of expansion as the relationship between the,

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:25.540
as you said, the grid lines on the notebook, right?

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:29.700
Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.140
between those points, how far they are from each other.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.340
And those can change, those point distances

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:39.120
can change over time because of the force of gravity.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.020
So it's weak and what we experience as gravity

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.540
is the changing of those trajectories

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.860
from being rectilinear to curvilinear.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.140
That's what we experience as gravity.

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:53.420
You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.700
about bowling ball and a trampoline.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.820
That's almost right because it's actually,

01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.140
you have to visualize that now in four dimensions

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:03.260
like wrapping a trampoline at every point around the object

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.260
including on the sides and it becomes very hard to visualize.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.060
So a lot of people use that.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.100
It's also fraught analogy because you're using gravity

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.420
like the notion of gravity pulling something down

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.140
to explain the notion of gravity.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:18.300
So it's a little overburdening the analogy.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.020
But okay, so you mentioned Barry Barish

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:22.420
wrote the forward to your book.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.820
How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.740
How do they, on the emotional level,

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:28.780
how do they make you feel that they're just

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.960
moving space time?

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.140
Yeah, so gravitational waves were,

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.560
the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves discovery

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.140
the first time, it was discovered twice,

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:43.900
indirectly by two men named Holson Taylor.

01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:45.980
And that was given my first year of graduate school.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.860
The day I entered graduate school almost,

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.740
they announced these two guys won it

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.180
and the guy who won it did the work

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.740
that would later win him the Nobel Prize

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.580
when he was my age.

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.100
Is this in the 40s?

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:56.940
This was, no, this was in the 90s.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:57.780
That was a joke.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.620
Yeah, that was good, that was good.

01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.460
All right, thank you.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:00.280
I got it, I got it.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.860
You know, to a cosmologist, age means nothing.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:03.940
And to a tennis player.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.780
Not on Tinder.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.460
That's right.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.660
All right, sorry.

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:09.500
Gravitational waves do fit in

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.100
because what we're trying to do now

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.100
is use the properties of gravitational waves,

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.260
the analogous properties that they have to photons,

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.100
that they travel at the speed of light,

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.180
that they go through everything,

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.700
they can go through everything,

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.660
and that they're directly detectable.

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:28.580
We're using them to try to confirm

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.020
if or if not inflation occurred.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:34.780
So did inflation, the spark that ignited

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.620
the fusion of the elements in the early part

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:37.860
of the universe and the expansion,

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.540
the initial expansion of the universe,

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.640
did that take place?

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.240
There's only one way that cosmologists believe

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.040
we could ever see that through the imprint

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.400
of these primordial gravitational waves,

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.440
not these old newcomers that Barry studies,

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.120
the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us,

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.760
a billion years ago,

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.560
but we're seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years ago

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.000
during the inflationary epoch.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.520
However, those we cannot build a LIGO

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.920
and put it at the Big Bang.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.320
So if you wanna measure,

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.520
let's say you have the old time firecracker,

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.720
let's say there's a firecracker,

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.240
and you wanna see if it went off

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.840
in the building next door to you.

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:19.640
You can't see it, so you can't see the imprint of it,

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.120
but you can hear it.

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.000
And what we're trying to do is hear

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.760
the effect of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:29.360
not by using a camera or even an interferometer

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.800
like Barry used and his colleagues,

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.320
but instead using the CMB, the light,

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.880
the primordial ancient fossils of the universe,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.600
the oldest light in the universe.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:43.040
We're gonna use that as a film, quote unquote,

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:46.080
onto which gravitational waves get exposed.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.640
And hope you can, so what are the challenges there

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:51.880
to get enough accuracy for the exposure?

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:54.000
So the signal, as I said,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.880
so there's 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter,

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.320
and there's a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.840
However, what we're looking for

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.880
is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.520
We're not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.240
We're looking for what its polarization is.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.840
And we'll go, let me just ask,

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.000
are you serious about the per cubic millimeter,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.080
420 is the number?

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:15.920
Centimeter.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.400
Cubic centimeter.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.240
Yeah.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.080
420 is the number.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:20.920
That's the number.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:21.760
I wonder if Elon knows this,

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.600
and if he doesn't, he will truly enjoy this.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.440
Okay.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.560
This is crazy.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.720
Yeah, it's true.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.280
Oh, okay, funding security, excellent.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.240
So, I mean, this takes us to this story

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.840
of heartbreak, of triumph,

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:38.360
of that you described in losing the Nobel Prize.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:42.080
So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.920
Yeah.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.080
Can you describe what bicep one and bicep two are?

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.080
Bicep three, perhaps,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.440
the instruments that can detect this kind of polarization.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.920
What are the challenges?

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.960
The origin story, the whole thing.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.800
Yeah.

01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.640
So, well, the origin story goes back again

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.360
to like a father-son rivalry.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:00.200
It really does.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.440
My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera,

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:04.200
but he never won a Nobel Prize.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.800
And, you know, some parents in America

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.960
they compete with their kids.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.440
Oh, I was a football player in high school.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:10.280
I'll show you.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.600
And whatever, wrestling, whatever.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:13.800
And some of us could be healthy too.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.720
But with me and my dad, it wasn't super healthy.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.480
We would compete and he was much more

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.560
of a pure mathematician

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.040
and I was an experimental physicist.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040
So we had both different ideas

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.680
on what was worth prioritizing our time.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.000
But I knew for sure he didn't win the Nobel Prize.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.200
And I knew I could kind of outdo him.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.760
So I feel pretty venal and kind of minuscule

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.560
kind of character-wise saying that.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.800
The only reason you could outdo him

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.600
is because the Fields Medal is given every four years.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.880
And only if you're under 40, which he was.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.640
So he's working under much more limited conditions.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.480
That's right.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.760
So even if I had, which, you know, spoiler alert,

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.520
the book's called Losing the Nobel Prize, so I didn't do it.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.920
But I wanted to do something big

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.040
and I wanted to do something that would really

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.720
just unequivocally be realized as a discovery for the ages.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.360
As in fact, it was when we made the premature announcement

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.520
that we had been successful.

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.800
So you were from the beginning

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.480
reaching for the big questions.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.320
That's all I could.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:14.400
So as an experimenter, you were swinging for the fences.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.640
That's all I wanted to do.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.680
I felt like if it's not, you know,

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.840
if it's worth spending, you know,

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.280
perhaps the rest of my life on as a scientist,

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.560
it better be damn well better be interesting to me

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.080
to carry me through, to give me the, you know,

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.400
I always say passion is great when people say,

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.680
oh, follow your passion, but it's not enough.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.880
Passion's like the spark that ignites the rocket,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.520
but that's not enough to get the rocket into space.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.840
So then you swung for the fences with Bicep One.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.760
What is this?

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.240
So Bicep One was born out of

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.520
kind of interesting circumstances.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.880
So I had gone to a Stanford University for a postdoc.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.680
So an academic hunger games.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.480
Stanford? Stanford University.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.240
Yeah, it's a small little school.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.200
It's not like that technical college in Massachusetts

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.680
that you're affiliated with.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.000
But as I went there,

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.760
I was working for a new assistant professor.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.960
She had gotten there only a year before I got there.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.440
And she had her own priorities,

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.040
the things that she wanted to do.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.520
But I kept thinking in my spare time

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.080
that I wanted to do something completely different.

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.680
She was studying galaxies at high redshift.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.800
And I wanted to study the origin of the universe

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:22.200
using this type of technology.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:25.440
And I realized courtesy of a good friend of mine

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.320
who's now at Johns Hopkins, Mark Haminkowski,

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.560
that we didn't need this enormous Hubble telescope.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:32.960
We didn't need a 30 meter diameter telescope.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.280
We needed a tiny refracting telescope,

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.920
no bigger than my head, you know,

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.160
less than a foot across.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.080
And that telescope would have the same power

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.600
as a Hubble telescope, you know,

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.120
size telescope could have

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.520
because the signals that we're looking for

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.800
are enormous in wavelength on the sky.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:50.320
They're enormously long, large area signals on the sky.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.240
And if we could measure that,

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.520
it would be proof effectively,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.960
as close as you get to proof,

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960
there could be things that mimic it,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.920
but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.600
Inflation being the signal originally conceived

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.280
by Alan Guth to explain why the universe

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.480
had the large scale features that it does,

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.080
namely that it has so-called flat geometry.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.160
So there's no way to make a triangle in space

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.400
in our universe that has three interior angles

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.280
that do not sum to 180 degrees.

01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:19.640
You can do that with spacecraft,

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:20.640
you can do that with stars,

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.640
you can do that with laser beams,

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.640
you can do that with three different galaxies.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.800
All those galaxies, no matter how far you go,

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.880
have this geometry, it's remarkable,

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:30.920
but it's also unstable, it's very unlikely,

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.000
it's very seemingly finely tuned.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.760
And that was one of the motivations that Guth had

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.640
to kind of conceive of this new idea

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.200
called inflation in 1979,

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.440
when he was a postdoc also at Stanford Slack.

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.440
And he was trying to get a permanent job,

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.600
I was trying to like make my name for myself.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.640
And so I realized I could do this,

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.840
but I was also being paid by this professor at Stanford

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.120
to do a job for her.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.840
And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.520
And then one day she couldn't take it anymore

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.040
because I was like sketching notebooks

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.160
and planning his experiments and I just, I wasn't, no.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:06.120
Big ideas in your mind, you were planning big experiments

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:10.040
and that was difficult to work with on a small scale

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.320
for like a postdoc type of situation.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.360
We have to publish basic papers,

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.840
deliver on some basic deadlines for a project,

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.680
all those kinds of things.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.160
And support your advisors, paying, she was paying me.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.160
And so one day I came in and actually involved

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.840
another friend of mine, astronomer named Jill Tarter,

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.800
one of the pioneers in the SETI science business

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.520
of detecting extraterrestrials,

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.920
which I assume you'd never like to talk about aliens,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.920
so I'm sure we won't get into aliens.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.240
But Jill was visiting Stanford and I was like,

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:41.440
I really want to meet her, can you introduce me?

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.280
And she said, no, in fact, you're fired, my boss.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.960
So I was like, this is possibly the best thing

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.120
that could ever happen to me.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.680
I didn't know where it would lead or what would happen to it,

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.240
but getting fired from this ultra prestigious university

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.640
turned out to be the path.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.200
I mean, literally it brings me here today

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.720
in that because of that, I ended up working

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.920
for another person in Caltech, which is in Pasadena.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.600
And she, my original boss, Sarah Church,

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.920
she got me the job with her former advisor,

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.000
a man by the name Andrew Lang.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.760
And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don't know,

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:22.680
like he was like Steve Jobs or Elon,

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.120
charismatic, handsome, persuasive, ideal man,

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.280
not the guy always in the lobby and doing everything,

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.960
but understood where things are going decades from now.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:35.200
And he had been involved in an experiment

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.840
that actually measured the universe was flat,

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.120
very close to flat, along with a preceding experiment

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.520
done at Princeton by Lyman Page and other collaborators.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.240
So the shape of the universe is flat.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.360
The geometry of the universe is flat.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.440
How did he do that experiment?

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.920
So he used the cosmic migrate background.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.800
And so what I said is you have to look for triangles

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:55.640
in the universe.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.960
So you can measure triangles on earth.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:00.000
You can actually, it's hard to show that the earth is curved,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.240
but you can show the earth is curved

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.040
using triangles, mountain tops, et cetera,

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.920
if you have an accurate enough protractor.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.760
Allegedly, yeah.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.600
Yeah.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.720
God, you're like auto canceling.

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.200
This is great.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.440
My ratings are gonna go up, man.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.680
This is gonna be great.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.520
Take out the cake.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.280
If you want actual science, go listen to Brian.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.760
If you want all of these conspiracy theories,

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:23.760
or AKA the truth about flat earth, listen to him.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.400
So what he used was the following triangle.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:32.320
There are proto-galaxy sized objects in the CMB.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.640
The cosmic migrate background has these patches.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.880
And so you can make a triangle out of the diameter

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.800
of one of these blobs of primordial plasma,

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.920
the soup that constitutes the early universe,

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:44.760
which is hydrogen.

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.120
It's very simple material.

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.280
Understand hydrogen, electrons, and radiation.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.120
Very simple.

01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:51.720
Plasma physicists, son, understand it.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.680
The diameter is one base of the triangle,

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.360
and then the distance to the earth is the other two legs.

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:00.000
So he measured, along with his colleagues at Caltech

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.160
and University of Rome and that other group at Princeton,

01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:06.520
measured the angle, interior angle,

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.680
effectively, very, very accurately,

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.280
and showed that it added up to 180 degrees.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.080
Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.040
Can you trace them back location-wise?

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:21.040
You can know where they are, but more than that,

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.520
there's so many of these patches.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.680
They're about one square degree on the sky.

01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:28.840
The sky, you may know, a sphere has about 44,000

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.520
square degrees in a sphere.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.960
So there's literally 44,000 of these size patches

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.080
over which he could do these kinds of measurements

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.680
to build up very good statistics.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.280
That's not exactly how they do it

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.560
or how they did it in this experiment called Boomerang,

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.840
but they did measure very accurately

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.520
what was called the first Doppler peak

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:49.680
or acoustic peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.680
So the sphere has approximately 44,000 square degrees.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.560
To cover a sphere, that's a very important data collection

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.880
thing when you're sitting on a sphere

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.800
and you're looking out into the observable universe.

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.880
So there's a lot of patches to work with.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.440
Yeah, and in fact, a lot of the fast

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.920
algorithmic decomposition of spheres and machine learning

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.040
in the early 2000s still used today

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.400
was created out of this field by data analysts

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.680
using this thing called hierarchical equal area triangles

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:24.640
called heel picks is what it's called.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.400
And so it's just stitch all this stuff together

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.680
and stitch it together very accurately.

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:32.200
Yeah, get high statistical significance

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:35.000
in order to reduce these statistical errors,

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.680
very clean signal and measurement device

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.320
to reduce the systematic errors.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.520
Those are the two predominant sources of error

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.680
in any measurement.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.920
Those that can be improved by more and more measurement,

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:46.520
you take more and more measurements to this table,

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.280
you'll get slightly better each time,

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.960
but you only win one over the square root

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.280
of the number of measurements.

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.600
But the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.640
So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.000
Again, it's not exactly how they did it.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.960
They also have to do a Fourier analysis,

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.400
decompose that, do a power spectrum filtration,

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.720
windows, there's a lot of work that goes into it,

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.320
image analysis, and then comparing that

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:10.960
with cosmological parameters, very simple model,

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.960
just six different numbers that go into a model

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.320
that made a prediction.

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.800
And one of those is the geometry of the universe pops out.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.560
And that is the universe has zero spatial curvature

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.000
and that was called boomerang.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.560
So he had just come off of this.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.240
Now, let me remind you, who was the first person

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.320
to measure the curvature of the earth?

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.960
It's a guy named Aristophanes in that, whatever,

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.000
lived around Aristotle's time.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.120
His name is in the history books.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:35.200
So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like,

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:38.040
he's like the next Aristotle, Aristophanes,

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.960
I just wanted to work for this guy.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.320
He clearly had this brand, he was about 40 at the time,

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.760
California Scientist of the Year.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.040
I was sure he was gonna win a Nobel Prize for that.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:51.760
And I knew that he, so I went down to Caltech

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.000
to give my job talk and he said, I love it, you got a job.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.520
And before I could even, before he finished the sentence,

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.760
I said, I'll take it, it was too good to be true.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.680
And I started working there at Caltech

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.240
and slowly but surely,

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:07.920
because Caltech's a rich private university,

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.320
at that time, run by a Nobel Prize winner

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.160
by the name of David Baltimore,

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.360
he just wrote us a check, Baltimore wrote us a check

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.360
and said, get started on this idea.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:17.880
And so we started coming with the idea

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.080
for what I later named BICEP,

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.720
background imaging cosmic extra galactic polarization,

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.680
which is kind of ironic

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.080
because we ended up measuring galactic polarization,

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.680
we'll get to that in a minute.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:31.120
But along the way, the idea was very simple.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.680
We're gonna make the simplest telescope

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.880
you can possibly make, which is a refracting telescope.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.480
You have two refracting telescopes in your head.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.800
Only way forward is making things more complex, right?

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.240
And when you make things complex in science,

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.200
you introduce the possibility for systematic errors.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.320
And so we wanted to build the cleanest instrument,

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.840
turns out a cleanest instrument you can build

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.040
in astronomy is a refracting telescope.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.200
We also had to, unlike that telescope or Galileo's,

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.240
we had to use very sensitive detectors

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:02.200
that were cooled less than one 20th of the temperature

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.360
of the cosmic background itself,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.080
which is the coolest temperature in the whole universe.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080
So we had to cool these down to about 0.1

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.320
or 0.2 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.720
To do that, we needed to put it inside

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.600
of a huge vacuum chamber and suck out all the air molecules

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.760
and water molecules and take it

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.280
to a very, very special place called the South Pole,

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:24.760
Antarctica, from which I retrieved for you a patch.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.960
There it is over there.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.320
So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.680
Bright, oh yeah.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.520
You fly down.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.120
I thought somebody was born in the Soviet Union.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.600
So we obviously like to call it red.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.840
United States Antarctic Program,

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:41.600
the National Science Foundation.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.800
And the base is called the Amundsen-Scott

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.440
South Polar Station.

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.600
So it's a little known fact of geopolitics

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.360
that whatever country occupies a region

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.000
has ownership over it.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.400
Now there is a treaty in Antarctica.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.560
You can't use it for military purposes,

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.360
for mining, et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.360
But I don't know if you know, but about 12 years ago,

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:01.720
Putin sent a submarine to the North Pole.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.280
There's no land at the North Pole, right?

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.120
So what did he do?

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.760
He stuck it on the ocean underneath.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.800
But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica,

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.200
which was first reached about 110 years ago,

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.400
the first time in human history.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.160
Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:19.960
It means like no bears there,

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.640
basically opposite of where polar bears are.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.160
Arctic means polar bear.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.560
That's where, in Creek.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.400
I did not know that.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.240
Fascinating.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.760
So Antarctic means the opposite place of that.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.440
So humans never even saw it,

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:30.680
let alone went to the South Pole,

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.520
which is kind of in the middle of that continent.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.280
We wanted to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.720
It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego, Texas,

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:43.760
and there's no place like the South Pole or Chile.

01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:46.600
Those are the two premier places on earth.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.680
Of course you'd like to go into space.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.520
There's no water in space.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.960
So it's not about cold, it's about dry.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.920
Exactly.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:55.000
So that's why, for example,

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.720
you can take this vodka

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.320
and you could put it in this cup, right?

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.440
And we could take it over to a microwave somewhere

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.280
and heat it up.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.960
After three minutes the water's boiling.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.800
You can't touch it.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.040
Take it from me, don't touch it.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.400
But you can touch the mug and take it out

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
if you want to, right?

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.240
Why?

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.040
Because the mug is totally bone dry.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:15.520
But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.480
because water molecules resonate exactly

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.040
at these microwave frequencies.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.720
So we don't want these precious photons,

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:24.680
420 of them traveling per cubic centimeter

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.600
from the Big Bang itself to get absorbed

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.040
in some water molecule in the earth's atmosphere.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.640
So you take it to a place with the fewest number

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.400
of water molecules per square centimeter of surface area.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.840
And that happens to be either Chile

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:39.400
or my other project, the Simons Observatories located,

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.560
or you take it to the South Pole.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.080
We took it to the South Pole

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:46.960
and spent a couple of months of my life down there.

01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:50.480
And it's like being on Hoth.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:53.560
It's a completely otherworldly environment.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.600
Ice, planar, flat as a pancake.

01:18:57.280 --> 01:18:59.920
And the buildings are built up on stilts.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:00.760
They're built up,

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.360
because the snow will otherwise cover them over.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:06.760
The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.960
If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth,

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.320
they yank them before you go down there.

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.920
If you have any issues with your appendix,

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.880
they'll cut it out of you before you go down there.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.040
The Russians at Vostok base, not too far away,

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.920
about 600 miles away.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.720
The doctors there, there's a famous picture

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.960
of one of them operating on himself,

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:25.760
taking out his own appendix in the middle of winter

01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.600
by himself.

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.640
It's a harsh condition,

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.800
science in the harshest of conditions.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.120
On Earth at least.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:32.600
And we go to those great lengths

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.280
because it's a pristine environment

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.480
to observe these precious photons.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.160
And we built this telescope

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.680
and it weighs tens of thousands of pounds.

01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.640
And it had to scan the sky almost like it's a robot.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.160
I mean, it's scanning the sky almost unattended.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.600
It needed, we have a guy who spends a year of his life

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.800
down there, a girl who spends a year

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.000
of their life down there.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.320
They're called winter overs.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.880
They arrive in sometimes as early as November

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.240
and they don't leave until the following December.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.720
And we always joke, we'll pay you $75,000.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.440
You just have to work for one night of your life.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.280
That's all.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.800
It's a long night.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.520
And what bicep is,

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.640
and I couldn't bring my polarized sunglasses here,

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.520
so I brought these actual polarizers here.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.520
So if you take this and put in front of your telescope there,

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.200
you have now made a polarimeter.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:24.160
You have made a polarization sensitive telescope.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.400
Now you may not be able to immediately know

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.880
how you would use such a thing,

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.040
but one way to think about it,

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:32.480
now take this guy and look at a light,

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.800
look at a light source,

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.880
put one up to your eye

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.960
and now put the other one in front of it anywhere

01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.120
and now rotate them.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.600
What happens to the light source?

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.520
It becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.200
Yeah, so that's called a quadrupolar pattern, right?

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:49.120
So it's repeating.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.840
It goes bright, dim, bright, dim.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:54.280
It rotates twice in intensity

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:56.280
for every single physical rotation.

01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.720
And that's because of the property of the photon.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.600
The photon is a spin one field,

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.560
but the polarization of light

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:07.280
is the axis at which its electric field is oscillating.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.280
Its electric field is marching straight up

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.520
and straight down.

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.160
And so therefore vertical polarization

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.000
is the same as negative vertical polarization.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.040
And so you get the same pattern as you rotate

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.200
two times for every one physical rotation.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.800
This is like a spin two object.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.240
So now if you put that in front of the telescope,

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:27.560
you can do one of two things.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.920
Now you're polarizing all the light that's going in

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.680
because you have one of the polarizers

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.120
and then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one,

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:37.120
you can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.040
Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.240
There's a crystal, it's called calcite.

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.840
This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Fridman.

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.400
This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes there

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.080
and tell me, what does it look like?

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.480
Like I could see everything twice.

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.560
It's a double image.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.400
It's a double image.

01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.680
That is a special crystal

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.680
that has two different indices of refraction.

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:05.000
So light emerging, which is unpolarized

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.240
from the black ink comes out

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.800
and it splits into two different directions.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.240
And it could split even more if I made the crystal,

01:22:12.240 --> 01:22:14.360
give you my more expensive crystal, but that's all I have.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.200
What is the crystal with this kind of property called?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.320
It's called calcite.

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:20.040
This is crystal, it's called birefringent crystal.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.440
Bi means two, refringent means refracting.

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.480
So this is a special type of material

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.440
that separates light based on its polarization.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.440
Pretty clean bi signal.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.280
Yeah.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.560
It's cleanly two.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.400
Yeah.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.760
I'm seeing two very cleanly.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:37.640
It's very crisp, right?

01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:40.000
So that's yours to keep with every time you host me.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.400
Now take the polarizer underneath your left hand.

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.240
Yep.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.560
Put it on top of the crystal

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:48.000
and kind of move it back and forth.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.400
Wow.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.680
This is incredible.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.280
You can switch as you rotate,

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.800
you switch from one signal to the other.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:58.680
So it's one of the refractions to the other.

01:22:58.680 --> 01:22:59.520
Whoa.

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:02.920
So that is now, you are analyzing the polarization.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.240
You're confirming the light comes out of the crystal,

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:07.200
two different types of polarization.

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.120
And effectively what we do is we have those two things,

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:13.760
if you like, but working in the microwave,

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.720
that's where the cosmic photons are brightest

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.920
in the microwave regime in the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.000
And we're coupling that to a refracting telescope,

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.440
but your eyes are refracting telescopes.

01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.520
So you are a polarimeter right now.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:29.200
The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization,

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.880
but otherwise it mainly detects its intensity of light

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:32.720
and the color.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.960
That's what we call color and intensity, brightness.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.040
So you're devising a instrument

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.880
that's very precisely measuring that polarization.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:39.960
Exactly.

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.920
And doing so in the microwave region

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:46.120
with detectors not made of biological human retina cells,

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:49.840
but of superconductors and things called biometers.

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.360
And this has to be done at temperatures

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.120
close to absolute zero under vacuum conditions,

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:58.640
one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:01.320
So why is it that this kind of device

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.120
could win a Nobel prize?

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.800
So when the CMB was discovered,

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.320
it was discovered serendipitously.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:11.560
There were two radio astronomers working at the time

01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:13.040
at Bell Laboratories.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.480
Now, why would Bell Laboratories

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:16.120
be employing radio astronomers?

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.560
Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple,

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.320
or it was like a think tank, or it was Google.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.160
Let's say it was like Google.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.760
Google has like Google X, it has this thing and that thing.

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.720
So they were working there,

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.520
but imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.960
They were actively recruiting.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:33.920
Why would they do that?

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.480
Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.160
was the first commercial satellite

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.000
launched for communication.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.360
So Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone,

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.200
part of AT&T and the early telephone company,

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.440
later invent the first cell phone, the year I was born,

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:52.680
and they would take that, 1946,

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:55.920
and they would take that telescope technology

01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.400
that radio astronomers had developed,

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:01.280
and they would use that to see if they could improve

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.240
the signal-to-noise of the satellites that they were seeing,

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.960
and they found they couldn't.

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:06.680
They found that they could not improve

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.200
the signal-to-noise ratio

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.080
of the first telecommunication satellite.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.080
It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second modem,

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.400
and they were bouncing signals from the west coast

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.320
up to the satellite, bouncing it down,

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.360
landing it in New Jersey, of all places,

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.600
in northern New Jersey, Holmville, New Jersey.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.320
And these radio astronomers couldn't get rid of the signal.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.160
So they said, well, New Jersey's not far from New York.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.560
Let's see if the signal's coming from New York.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.960
Nope, not coming from New York.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.240
Let's see if it changes with the year.

01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.360
Maybe it's coming from the galaxy,

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:38.680
which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930 something.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.480
So in not being able to reduce the signal

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.440
or increase the signal-to-noise ratio,

01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.440
the noise was-

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:45.280
It was the noise.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.720
They knew the signal was right.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:48.120
They couldn't get rid of the noise.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.800
And there was excess noise over the model

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.120
that had not only been predicted by them,

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.840
but had been measured by a previous guy,

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.640
a guy by the name of Edward Ohm.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.400
He measured the same signal,

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.360
found that there was this hiss of static,

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.680
of radio static that he could not get rid of,

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.000
that had a value of about three Kelvin.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:04.840
So you can translate.

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:07.520
Remember I said, if you take a radio telescope

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.560
and you have pointed at an object that's hot,

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.960
the radio telescope's detector

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.120
will get to the same temperature as the object.

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.480
It's a principle of radiothermodynamics.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.680
So it's a really interesting thing.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:18.520
It's a thermometer.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.120
You can stick it into Jupiter from here on earth.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.520
It's amazing.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:24.560
And so we in radio astronomy characterize our signal

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:27.640
not by its intensity, but by its temperature.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.640
So he found this guy, Edward Ohm,

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:31.160
oh, there's this three Kelvin signal.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.280
I can't get rid of it.

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:35.000
It must be I did my error analysis wrong.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.120
And I would give him an F if he was one of my,

01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.840
first year students,

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.520
but he's just attributed to lack of understanding.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.760
These other guys, Penzias and Wilson,

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.520
who are also radio astronomers,

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.360
they said, no, let's build another experiment,

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.600
put that inside of our telescope

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.000
and do what's called calibration.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.600
Inject a known source of signal every second

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.720
that has a temperature of about four Kelvin,

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.280
because the signal that they were trying to get rid of

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.440
is about three Kelvin.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.920
And you wanna have it as close as possible

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.840
to the pernicious signal as possible.

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.320
They did that once a second.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.560
So they got billions of measurements,

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.840
millions of measurements over the course

01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.280
of several months, years, and even,

01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.520
by the end of maybe millions of measurements for sure.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.320
And they found they couldn't get rid of it either,

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.400
but they measured it was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.480
So how does having a four Kelvin source,

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.560
how does the calibration work just out of curiosity?

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:27.400
It could be larger.

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.120
Imagine like you're trying to calibrate the microphone.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.240
Like you could do it with like a really loud sound,

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.520
but the gain would start to compress.

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.920
So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:38.400
in every experiment that I've ever worked on.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.240
And they only have a linear region over a very small region.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:43.360
And you wanna keep it as linear as possible.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.160
That means you want, if you're trying to get rid of it,

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.080
you're trying to compare like a voice

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.120
and you're trying to compare that to a jet engine,

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:52.520
it's not gonna be as easy on the amplifiers

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:56.000
as getting a slightly, a gong or something, a violin.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.160
So the idea of the noise is present in both?

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.400
There's noise present in both.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.680
And you measure, what they did is they made

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:05.560
a separate measurement just to the calibration system,

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.240
which they measured exactly very well.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.360
Four Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.520
That's a temperature that's not gonna change.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.440
And it's certainly not gonna change

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.200
over a time scale of one second.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.800
And so they could compare unknown signal, known signal,

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.920
unknown signal, known signal, like a scale, like a balance.

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.400
So another way to think about it is like this.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.560
You've seen these Libra kind of balances

01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.440
where you put two weights in a pan, right?

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.600
What happens if you put like a one ounce weight

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.440
on one side and a 20 kilogram weight?

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.120
You don't get any measurement, right?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.400
You do get kind of a measurement if they're close in weight.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.840
That's why they use four Kelvin.

01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:36.440
Got it, but just to linger on the fact

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:38.280
that there's a romantic element to the fact

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:41.240
that you're arriving at the same temperature.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.080
That's kind of fascinating.

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.680
And you're measuring stuff in terms of,

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.680
you're measuring signal in terms of temperature

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.520
at the source.

01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.480
So you get to, I mean, there's something

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.240
about temperature that's intimate.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.600
Yeah, it's cool.

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.400
Yeah, especially since all life is basically

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.960
conversion of energy and trying to control entropy,

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.640
which is then related to thermodynamics exactly in that way.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.680
And this is very crucial kind of thing to do in science

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.680
because they weren't looking for the signal.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:11.240
They found it accidentally, these two scientists,

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.760
Penzias and Wilson.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.200
And I like to think that those kinds of discoveries

01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.560
are the purest in science.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.120
Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said,

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.600
like the most important reaction as a scientist

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.360
is not eureka, which means in Greek, as you know,

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.480
I have found it.

01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:29.080
No, he said, no, he said like, that's weird.

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.920
Like that's a much better reaction or that's freaking cool.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.120
Like that's a scientist, not like, oh, I found one.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.120
Surprise.

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.760
Yeah, because if you find what you're gonna find,

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.000
that's what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.240
which is deadly inside, as close to deadly as possible.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:47.960
So how does that take us to something

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.120
that's potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:54.240
So Penzias and Wilson weren't looking for a signal.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.520
They ended up discovering the heat left over from the fusion

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.640
of helium from hydrogen, et cetera.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.080
And that was a serendipitous discovery.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.840
They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.680
It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.880
My reasoning is, what if you could explain

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.760
not only how the elements got formed,

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.840
but how the whole universe got formed

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:16.720
and kill off every other model of science?

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.800
So if that weren't enough, every scientist,

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.480
worth his or her salt, had told me and Andrew Lang

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.480
and our colleagues, this is a slam dunk Nobel Prize,

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.200
if you could do it, because it was really explaining,

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.080
again, the stakes of this science

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.920
is different than superfluidity, plasma physics.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:36.440
When you talk about the origin of the universe,

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:37.880
it ties into everything.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.880
It ties into philosophy, theology.

01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:45.480
You realize, if Paul Steinhardt is correct,

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.280
that the Bible can't be correct.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:49.360
In other words, the Bible is correct now.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:52.120
It isn't falsified, if you like, if you believe it.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.840
I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.

01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.840
But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.600
What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular?

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.480
It would be more like the cosmology of Akhenaten

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.400
and Egyptians than the biblical Torah,

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:08.600
Old Testament, if you will, narrative.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:11.400
So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:12.680
And again, it's not an offense,

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.120
because we need plasma physics.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:17.600
We need every type of physics except maybe biophysics.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:19.680
We literally use every branch of physics,

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:22.200
thermodynamics, superconductivity, quantum mechanics,

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.880
all that goes into our understanding of the instrument.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.680
And even further, if you want to understand the theory

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.760
that predicts the signal that we purport to measure.

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.640
So I rationalized that if Penzias and Wilson

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:35.360
won the Nobel Prize for this,

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.640
if Holson Taylor won the Nobel Prize

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:39.800
for indirectly detecting gravitational waves,

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.360
this is decades before LIGO,

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.400
by me detecting gravitational waves indirectly,

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.840
detecting how the universe began,

01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.840
detecting the origin of the initial conditions

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:52.600
for the Big Bang nucleosynthesis,

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.080
which won the Nobel Prize in 1983,

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:57.920
these are like five Nobel Prizes, potentially.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:00.840
For that reason, it seemed as close as you could possibly

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:04.280
get to being a slam dunk, to outdo what my father did,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:06.200
to do really this impossible.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.760
And at that time, again, it sounds weird,

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:15.760
because people are like, oh, you still want the Nobel Prize.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.120
You're still like reading, and look,

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.160
you wrote another book about it.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.200
And I always joke, I'm like, well,

01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:21.400
if you want to see if I'm a hypocrite,

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.880
just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.600
And if I accept it, then I'm a hypocrite.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.240
Wait, well, we'll get to your current feelings

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.600
on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrisy and so on.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:36.600
But, so there's this ambition, let's say this device,

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.600
this kind of signal could unlock many of the mysteries

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.280
about the early universe.

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.240
And so there's excitement there.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:47.040
So let's take it then further.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:50.240
I mean, there's a human story here of a bit of heartbreak.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:54.560
Not only was this possibly worth a Nobel Prize,

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.160
if the Nobel Prize was given,

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.680
you were excluded from the list of three

01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:01.520
that would get the Nobel Prize.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.520
So why were you excluded?

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:07.600
Maybe that's a place to tell the story of Bicep Two.

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.200
Yeah, so Bicep Two, like iPhones,

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.040
or I know you're an Android fan boy,

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.480
but every year they get a little bit better.

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.040
They get more megapixels, they get more optics,

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:19.640
triple X zoom, whatever, okay, right?

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.500
We upgraded our detectors as well.

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.440
The initial detectors were based on

01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.880
what are called semiconductors.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:26.720
They have certain properties

01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.280
that make them very difficult to replicate at scale.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:31.920
And we wanted to make them into superconductors,

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:35.360
which had a virtue that you could then mass produce them.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.680
Why superconductors?

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:38.200
Well, again, we're measuring heat.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.200
So one thing about a superconductor

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.360
is that it transitions from some finite resistance

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.040
to zero resistance over a very short span

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:48.380
of temperature range.

01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:51.320
That means you can use that very short span dependency

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.880
as an accurate and sensitive and precise thermometer.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:57.000
And so my brilliant colleagues around the world,

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.040
in this case, Jamie Bach,

01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.640
and nowadays Suzanne Staggs at Princeton,

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.960
they are just exquisitely making these sensors,

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:05.820
tens of thousands of them.

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.720
The initial Bicep One instrument,

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.480
of course we just called it Bicep,

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:12.240
that only had 98 detectors.

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.560
Simon's Observatory is gonna have 100 times more

01:34:15.560 --> 01:34:17.760
just in one of our four telescopes.

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:21.720
We're gonna have 60,000 detectors operating full-time

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.500
at 0.1 degree above absolute zero

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.480
in the Atacama Desert, we'll get there.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:30.200
But in the case of getting back to what Bicep did,

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:32.600
we upgraded it and made Bicep Two.

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:37.600
In January 2010, we had just installed

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.280
in the exact same location at the South Pole,

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280
in the same building,

01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.320
which is ominously called the Dark Sector Laboratory, DSL,

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.840
still operating to this very day.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:54.320
We installed a new receiver on the same platform as before,

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.280
had very similar identical optics,

01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.240
cryogenics, vacuum, everything,

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.000
except it went from 98 detectors to 512 detectors.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.520
So almost an order of magnitude, very substantial upgrade.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.820
And it had certain other features

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:08.560
that made it even more powerful

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:10.980
but then just a naive factor of five.

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.680
And then we started observing with that

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.120
and we knew we'd have years to go

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.320
and maybe we'd never see anything.

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:17.560
Again, we're looking for these tiny little reverberations

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.880
in the fabric of space-time

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.320
produced close to the origin of the universes

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.040
we could ever get to.

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.360
So I was playing a role in that.

01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.160
Obviously it had upgraded my version of the original idea

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.640
that I had had for Bicep along with Andrew Lang.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.160
And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160
and I got a call from Andrew Lang's,

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:41.760
or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang's thesis advisor,

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.080
Paul Richards at UC Berkeley.

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.920
And he said that Andrew was dead.

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.000
He had taken his life by suicide.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.320
And this is a man,

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.520
and I'd already lost my father at this point in 2010,

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.760
but he was like a father figure to me, Andrew.

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.640
He would give me advice on marriage

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.480
and how I should be with my kids

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:03.300
and what was the most important way

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.680
to move through the academic ladder.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.200
Again, he was pretty naturally suited

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:08.540
to win the Nobel Prize.

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.800
Everyone always thought he would win it.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.600
If he were alive, he still could win it.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.040
In fact, his wife or his ex-wife won it,

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:17.720
Frances Arnold in 2018.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:20.480
And it was this power couple

01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.720
and it destroyed me for a long time

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:27.800
because he was just this magical person.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.400
I couldn't conceive of my career, my life,

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:34.420
even like these aspects of raising kids

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:36.980
and being married without him.

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:38.960
And to do it in that way,

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.560
it felt like, again, he's got kids

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:44.240
and I feel terrible for them, obviously,

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.480
but it did feel like a betrayal.

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:46.640
I mean, I'm just being honest with you.

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:50.200
It felt like, why the F did you not reach out?

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.640
I thought we were close and I couldn't.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.760
I told him everything

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:56.360
and I felt like he had told me everything.

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:57.440
And now he was gone.

01:36:57.440 --> 01:36:59.920
And then inevitably we had to keep running the instrument.

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.760
I mean, there's millions of dollars invested,

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.680
careers at stake, young people working tremendously hard.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.640
And then here we were.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.320
And like, who's gonna take over the lead?

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.880
He was the lead of the project at Caltech.

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.160
And then it turned out that the other collaborators

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:15.680
with whom I had been working for years

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:18.200
and shared a lot of ups and downs with as well,

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.080
they had decided to form a collaboration

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.480
in which I was no longer the principal investigator.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.560
I was no longer one of the co-principal investigators

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.920
as I was on BICEP1.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:29.560
So I continue on BICEP1 as the co-leader of it,

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.040
but not on BICEP2.

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.640
And obviously that was pretty painful.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.280
This is all happening at the same time

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.360
as you lose this father figure.

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.200
Now there's this kind of just one betrayal in a way.

01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.400
And then there's another or something

01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.840
that feels like a betrayal.

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.280
Yeah, and he had kind of been the one,

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.600
the only one looking out for my interest

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.800
in the new experiment.

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.480
I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.200
and there were other post-docs in the mix,

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.240
all of whom would come there to work with him

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:03.720
to get the approbation that would then lead

01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.800
to their careers taking off as it did for mine.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.040
And so there was a competition.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:13.240
Science is not free from egos and competition

01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.800
and desires rightfully or wrongfully

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.400
for credit and attribution.

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:20.240
Was he the source of strength and confidence for you

01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:21.960
as a scientist, as a man?

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.200
I mean, we're kind of alone in this world.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.400
When you take on difficult things,

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:31.680
we often kind of grasp at a few folks

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.120
that give us strength.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:37.240
Was he basically your only source of strength

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:38.200
in this whole journey?

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.800
Primarily in terms of this close knit?

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:43.560
As a scientist, there were really two.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:46.040
There was one, this Russian cosmologist,

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:48.440
Alexander Polnareff, who thankfully is very much alive.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:51.000
He was at Queen Mary University.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.480
Now he's retired.

01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.960
He was kind of the theoretical cosmological father to me.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:58.720
And then Andrew was this counterpoint

01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:00.280
that was teaching me,

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.520
you need to have a brand as a scientist.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.600
Every scientist has a brand and some of them don't protect it.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.800
Some of them don't burnish it.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.000
But some of the skills about being a scientist,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.560
we don't teach our students,

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.560
involve how do you cultivate a scientific persona?

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.800
And he was the exemplar for that,

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.600
in addition to being the avuncular,

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.280
father figure type character that really

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.520
was the person I would talk to.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.400
I had issues with, when I had issues with my own students

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.680
and he would tell me how those were

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.960
and he would tell me his misgivings

01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.360
about people that he worked with

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.560
or things in his personal life.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.200
And it was, it was, it was devastating.

01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:40.720
But again, like, who the hell am I?

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:41.720
I'm not his kid.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:44.480
You know, he lost, his kids lost father, you know, it's,

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:46.800
so I feel guilty talking about it in that sense,

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.520
but it's just a reality, you know.

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.640
Well, there is something that's not often talked about

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.080
is people who collaborate on scientific efforts.

01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:58.720
I mean, that's, I don't, again, don't want to compare,

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:01.200
but you know, it's, it's sometimes

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.560
when the collaborations are truly great,

01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:08.560
it sounds similar as when veterans talk about

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:11.400
their time serving together.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.960
There's a bond that's formed.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.000
So like comparing family and this kind of thing is,

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.960
you know, it is not productive,

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.960
but the depth of the bond is nevertheless real

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:28.200
because you're taking on something,

01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:29.760
you're taking on the impossible.

01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:32.560
You're trying to achieve something,

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.000
sort of like there's this darkness,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.680
this fog of mystery that we're all surrounded by,

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.480
which is what the human condition is.

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:42.880
And you are like grasping at hope

01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.720
through the tools of science.

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.000
And you're doing that together with like a confidence

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.080
you probably should not have,

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:51.520
but you're boldly pushing through.

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:56.520
And then for him to take his own life,

01:40:57.240 --> 01:40:59.600
can I ask you about this kind of moment

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:03.680
that combined, I don't want to say betrayal,

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:07.840
but perhaps the feeling of betrayal that BICEP2

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:09.120
kind of goes on without you,

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.280
even though you're part of it,

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.200
you're not part of the leadership group.

01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.120
Can you describe those low points?

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.640
Was there a depression?

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.800
Or was there a crumbling of confidence?

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:26.080
Yeah, I mean, it was so wrapped up

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.720
with my identity as a person,

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.000
like there's only a few different ways to have identity.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.760
And unless you're unhealthy psychologically,

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:35.760
one of them for scientists

01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:37.080
is often that they're a scientist.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:39.120
And that sometimes is their primary identity.

01:41:39.120 --> 01:41:41.880
Now I've got other, I'm a husband and father,

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.800
but at that time that was my identity.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:48.040
So to have that kind of taken away,

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.920
it reminded me of being kind of adopted

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.800
in a sense like the one who created me

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:58.320
or that I had played a role in my life,

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:00.800
that he abandoned me in a sense.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.640
It felt like these people are abandoning me.

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:04.320
And the only thing I'd correct about the analogy

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.040
that you use is like in the war,

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.680
they're all working for common good.

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.600
It's not like I want to get the most kills.

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.360
I compare it more to like a band,

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.400
like think about the Beatles and what they did.

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.120
And then they rip the part because of egos, credit,

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:21.240
they had solo careers,

01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.360
they had relations of their intimates and so forth.

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.800
And there it's not only for the common good,

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.160
there is more of a zero sum aspect.

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:33.920
Like I would say science is not, science is an infinite game.

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.800
You can't win science.

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.400
You never get to the, oh, we won science.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.880
And even the Nobel Prize, they don't feel like,

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:39.720
oh, we're done.

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.280
They feel like a lot of times they're imposters,

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:42.960
even to that day.

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:45.760
However, science is made up of a lot of,

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:47.880
lot of, lot of finite games

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:49.960
where there is only one winner for tenure.

01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.240
There is only three winner,

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.840
are only three winners for the Nobel Prize.

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:56.000
And because of that, I think it's heterodox

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:57.560
and it's very confusing,

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.160
especially there's no guide.

01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.760
I never got a guide how to be a professor,

01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.520
how to teach, how to lead a research group,

01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.000
how to deal with the death of an advisor,

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.760
how to deal with an unreally graduate student or two.

01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.920
You know, so we're all like reinventing it,

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.400
which is kind of ironic and insane if you think about it,

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.320
because the academic system that I am a part of

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.840
and you are a part of is a thousand years old.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:21.680
Dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy, 1088 or so,

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.200
first universities were established.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.520
And you know, very little has changed.

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:28.920
There's some guy or gal scratching a rock

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.960
on another piece of rock and you know, lecturing in front.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.200
And there's only one better aspect nowadays is that

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.920
back then the students could go on strike

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.320
if they didn't like the professor

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:39.960
and then he or she wouldn't get paid.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.200
Probably mostly it was he's back then.

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.440
Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced

01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:46.320
by tenure, so okay.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.120
But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug

01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:52.120
getting pulled out from underneath me,

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:55.440
because you know, he was like my consigliore.

01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:59.080
He was a guy I, you know, sought counsel and counseled me

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:02.480
and he's dead and I felt like there is no one

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.600
who's gonna honor the agreements that we had.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.160
And he was a very soulful person.

01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.640
He was so much better at being a scientist

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.480
than I could ever be.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.000
And just the loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.280
And you know, I thought, oh, like, you know,

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.960
it's so sad because he could have won the Nobel Prize.

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.440
I don't think like that anymore.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.200
First I think about his kids.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.520
I felt at first now there goes my chance

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.520
at winning a Nobel Prize and hence the title of the book

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:31.160
was like I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:33.040
It also means that there's parts of the Nobel Prize

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:34.200
that have to be done away with.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.280
It's a double entendre.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.520
Like we need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.640
to help science out.

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:40.040
We can talk about that at a different time.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.320
But in the context of like now thinking back on it,

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.240
that was such a minuscule part of it

01:44:46.240 --> 01:44:49.280
because let's say he did win the Nobel Prize

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:52.080
or I did win the, or you know, any of us did.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:53.280
Would that have changed anything?

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.160
Would that have brought anything back?

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.800
It's so, you know, we say it's like vanity, it's futility.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:03.800
And I just, you know, for me, the Nobel Prize is like,

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.120
I don't wanna say it's like insignificant

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.680
because obviously it has a lot of power and it has influence.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.000
And you know, I went back,

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.520
I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show.

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.040
I'm gonna name drum, okay?

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:17.480
And he prepares, he prepares like a surgeon

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.440
before doing surgery when he goes on a talk show.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.880
So you see him going on Colbert Report.

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:24.320
You think, oh, they just have a banter

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:25.440
and he's just naturally gifted.

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.120
No, he said, no, no, no.

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.800
You say that, you're undermining what he does.

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:31.320
What he does is he goes back,

01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.720
he watches the last month of Colbert Reports

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:35.760
or whatever it's called, Late Show.

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:38.560
And he says, how long does Stephen pause between questions?

01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.280
How long in the news cycle does he go back?

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.240
What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.640
So I took Neil and I did that for you.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.720
And I look back, how many times has Lex mentioned

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:50.240
the words Nobel and prize?

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:51.920
And I put it into Google Ngram.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:55.080
And out came exactly the same number of times

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:59.000
as show episodes as of this moment.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.720
So you've said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.

01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.600
Yeah, I mean, it is so strange as a symbol

01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.360
that kind of unites this whole scientific journey, right?

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:14.360
Like, it's both sad and beautiful

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:19.560
that a little prize, like a little award, a medal,

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.000
a little plaque, they'll be most likely forgotten

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.320
by history completely, some silly list.

01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.200
It's somehow a catalyst for greatness.

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.640
It resulted in you doing your life's work.

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.080
The dream of it.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.760
Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.120
I can't necessarily counterfactually state

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.520
that that would have happened.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.080
So no, it definitely has a place.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:50.360
And for me, it is valuable to think about it.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.880
But the level of obsession that academics have about it

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.560
is really, I think it is almost on balance

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.200
becoming unhealthy.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.320
And again, I have no, I make no truck

01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.880
with the winners of the Nobel Prize.

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.240
Obviously, now I've had 11 on the show.

01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:11.800
And to think about the one rule, so by the way,

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:13.800
right after the denouement of the story,

01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:15.520
which I'll get to in a bit,

01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.320
how our dreams went down to dust and ashes,

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:21.520
I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:25.480
to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics.

01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.440
So like the one that I theoretically

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:31.520
could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually,

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.400
they asked me to nominate.

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.280
Now imagine if I ask you, Lex, you say, Brian,

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:37.160
instead of me inviting myself on the show,

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:38.680
if you say, Brian, would you like to come

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.120
on the Lex Fridman podcast?

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:43.040
I say, you know what, Lex, you know that guy Rogan,

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:46.040
I think you might, can you introduce him to me?

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.760
Like, do you imagine how that would feel?

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:50.040
Like you'd be like, after, you know, maybe.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:51.320
So I was asked to nominate the winners.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:53.400
And the one rule that they say,

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.840
of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated,

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.760
there's only one rule that they maintained.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:00.000
In other words, he said one person can win it

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.960
for something they discovered in the preceding year

01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:06.120
that had the greatest benefit to mankind,

01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:07.920
made the world better, right?

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.520
None of that was mentioned in the letter.

01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.360
It said many people can win it for what worked on long ago.

01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:14.080
They didn't mention anything in the letter to me,

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.760
signed by the secretary general.

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:17.000
Nothing about benefiting mankind.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.240
They said, just one thing, can't nominate yourself.

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.200
So none of these guys nominated themselves.

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.880
Actually, little known fact,

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:26.480
they sent that exact letter just to you.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:30.000
That rule was created just for you.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.840
That's called the Keating Correlate.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:32.880
Yes, exactly.

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.920
Just to like.

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:34.760
Good for them.

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.680
Rub it in.

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.000
I mean, it's, in this particular case, of course,

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.360
it's like some weird technicality or whatever,

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:43.720
but in this particular case,

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:47.120
it's kind of a powerful reminder

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.360
that the Nobel Prize leaves a lot of people behind

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:54.360
in that there's stories behind all of that.

01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:55.520
Yeah, I mean, here's a good example.

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.080
Again, this is my friend, Barry Barish.

01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:59.240
He's become like a mentor and a friend.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.040
He wrote the foreword to my book, Into the Impossible.

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:07.080
He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died,

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:09.080
and he admits it, and he said it.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.320
And actually, it's funny with him

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.520
because I've heard you talk very rhapsodically

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:16.160
and lovingly and romantically with Harry Cliff

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:18.360
and a wonderful podcast with him, by the way,

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.280
about the ELHC and how wonderful it is

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.560
and how in that, we were about to build

01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:27.040
the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas,

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:30.360
and it didn't get built and got canceled by Congress.

01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:31.280
And I say to Barry,

01:49:31.280 --> 01:49:33.040
that was the best thing that ever happened to you.

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.320
And he's like, what the hell are you talking about?

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.880
I'm like, if that didn't get canceled,

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.480
first of all, even though it did get canceled,

01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:41.920
the Europeans went on to build it themselves,

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:44.320
saved the American taxpayers billions of dollars,

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.120
and we wouldn't have learned anything

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:48.680
really substantially new as proven by the fact

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:50.240
that as you and Harry talked about,

01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:52.800
nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note

01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:55.280
has come out, and actually, he's had a recent paper,

01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.680
but it's been an upper limit along with his collaborators

01:49:57.680 --> 01:49:58.880
on the LHCB experiment

01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.760
that I'm gonna be talking with him about.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.560
But the bottom line is it was really built

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:03.380
to detect the Higgs.

01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:06.260
SSC, for twice as much money,

01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:07.700
would have sucked up Barry's career,

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.740
and he would have been working on that, maybe not,

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:11.940
and then he would never have worked on LIGO,

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:13.980
and then he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, right?

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:15.460
So you look at counterfactual history.

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.980
That's not actually a big stretch, right?

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.100
If the SSC had still gone on, he would have worked on it

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.500
because he was one of the primary leaders

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.860
of that experiment.

01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:26.260
Second thing, if, imagine the following thing had happened.

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.440
They won the Nobel Prize because in September 2015,

01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:32.340
they detected unequivocal evidence

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:35.940
for the in-spiral collision of two massive black holes,

01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:38.220
each about 30 times the mass of the sun,

01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:40.420
leaving behind an object that had

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:43.180
just less than 60 solar masses behind,

01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:46.480
so one solar mass worth of matter got mass,

01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:49.040
got converted to pure gravitational energy.

01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.260
No light was seen by them.

01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:56.260
This particular date, September 14th, 2015, okay?

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.960
That explosion, because of the miracle of time travel

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:01.200
that the telescopes afford us,

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.880
that actually took place 1.2 billion years ago

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.280
in a galaxy far, far away.

01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.920
They actually don't know which galaxy it took place in,

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.480
still, and they never will.

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.680
Okay, if that collision between these two things,

01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:15.240
which have probably been orbiting each other

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:17.600
for maybe a million years or more,

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:20.240
if that had occurred 15 days earlier,

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.720
Barry wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:23.560
Because-

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.080
It's hilarious to think that there's one human

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.820
that won the Nobel Prize because two giant things

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:34.180
collided a billion, 200 million years ago,

01:51:34.180 --> 01:51:37.340
and if it had happened 18 days, 20 days, 30 days,

01:51:37.340 --> 01:51:39.300
because that was the deadline

01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.780
for the Nobel Prize to be announced,

01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.260
they announced the findings in February,

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.380
but you have to nominate the winners in January,

01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:48.100
so I could have nominated them up until January 30th,

01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:49.820
but they didn't announce anything,

01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:53.060
and there were just rumors, and so he didn't,

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.660
but the reason that he wouldn't have won it,

01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:56.580
because there was another guy who was still alive,

01:51:56.580 --> 01:51:58.700
considered to be the founder and father

01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.420
of the three fathers, Ray Weiss, who did win it,

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:02.780
Kip Thorne, who did win it,

01:52:02.780 --> 01:52:05.180
and the third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Drever,

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:08.780
who passed away, again, he was alive in 2016,

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.140
he died in the middle of 2017,

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.640
and then he wasn't awarded the Nobel Prize.

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:16.600
And here we are, several billion of hairless apes

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:19.820
that strangely wear clothing,

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:24.820
celebrated three other clothed hairless apes

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:30.460
with a medal, with one particular element,

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:34.020
and then they made speeches in a particular language

01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:35.260
that evolved.

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:38.820
Bend down to get those medals in front of another guy

01:52:38.820 --> 01:52:43.260
who wears even fancier clothes, who is the king of Sweden.

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.940
And then they got some free food afterwards.

01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:47.060
They got some reindeer meat, that's right.

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:48.580
Okay, excellent.

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:53.080
Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example,

01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:56.140
what happened to you in terms of BICEP too,

01:52:57.200 --> 01:53:01.020
I wanna kind of speak at a high level

01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:02.580
about a particular thing I observed.

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:05.920
So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast.

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.080
I was just listening to the podcast.

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.560
I'm a huge fan of podcasts in general.

01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:14.560
And it also coincided with my entry into grad school

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:17.640
and this whole journey of academia.

01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:20.560
So grad school, getting my PhD, then going to MIT,

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.160
and then Google, and then just looking

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:24.760
at this whole world of research.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:31.540
What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:37.360
is that he celebrates others, like he promotes them.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.880
He gets like genuinely, and I now know this

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.600
from just being a friend privately,

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:47.600
he genuinely gets excited by the success of others.

01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:52.760
And the contrast of that to how folks in academia

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.720
often behave was always really disappointing to me.

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.740
Because the natural, just on a basic human level,

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:04.980
there is an excitement, but the nature of that excitement

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:08.640
is more like I'm happy for my friend,

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:11.400
but I'm really jealous and I want to even outdo them.

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.960
I wanna celebrate them, but I wanna do even better.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.040
So even that's even for friends.

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:21.040
So there's not a genuine pure excitement for others.

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.040
And then couple that with just you now as a host

01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.260
of a popular podcast know this feeling,

01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:31.220
which is like there's not even a willingness

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:35.280
to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:40.280
People in academia are often best equipped technically

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.400
in terms of language to celebrate others.

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:48.080
They understand the beauty, like the full richness

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.020
of why the cool idea is as cool as it is,

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.200
and they're in the best position to celebrate it.

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:57.040
And yet there's a feeling that if I celebrate others,

01:54:57.040 --> 01:54:59.920
they might end up on the cover of Nature, whatever,

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.760
and not me.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:03.920
They turn it into a zero-sum game.

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:08.180
The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.080
to me and many others is that it doesn't have to be that way.

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.320
And forget money and all those kinds of things that,

01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:20.320
I think there's a narrative told that academics are this way

01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:23.240
because there's a limited amount of money,

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.600
and so they're fighting for this.

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.520
I don't think that's the reason it's happening this way.

01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.960
I think you can have limited amount of money.

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:36.920
The battle for money happens in the space of proposal,

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:39.400
there's networking, there's private stuff.

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:42.840
Public celebration of others, and just actually

01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:46.240
just how you feel in the privacy of your own heart

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:48.580
is not have to do anything with money.

01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:52.040
It has to do with you having a big ego

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:55.080
and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the journey

01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.520
that we're all on.

01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.640
And there's folks like Joe Rogan, who in a comedian circles

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.000
is also rare, but he inspired all these other comedians

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.640
to realize, you know what, it's great to celebrate

01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:08.560
each other, we're promoting each other,

01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:10.360
and therefore the pie grows,

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.920
because everybody else gets excited about this whole thing,

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:14.120
and the pie grows.

01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:17.000
Right now, the scientists, by fighting,

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:20.040
by not celebrating each other, are not growing the pie,

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.240
and now, because of that, science becomes

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:24.080
less and less popular.

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.680
The flywheel, exactly.

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:26.760
No, and I wanna point out two things.

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.920
One is that I remember you went on Joe's show

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:34.520
maybe a couple years ago, and then he gave you a watch,

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:36.320
he gave you like a Rolex, right?

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.560
And I tweeted to you, and I think it's-

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.400
Omega.

01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.320
Yeah, sorry, okay, fine.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.440
The watch that went to the moon,

01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:44.640
which we will get to in a bit.

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.200
I don't think he could give you what I gave you,

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.720
though, by the way.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.560
We'll get to what that final gift package is for you.

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.360
And by the way, I also wanted to mention,

01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:55.240
because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset,

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:57.080
and you should definitely go on Joe Rogan,

01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:59.640
and we had this conversation with him,

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.640
because I was like, when I was moving to Austin,

01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.560
and had a conversation like, don't you think it's weird

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.120
if we have the same guests at the same time, or whatever?

01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:12.640
He's like, fuck that.

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:14.640
I want you to be more successful than me.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:18.560
I want, he truly wants everybody,

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.240
especially people close to him, to be more successful.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:23.200
There's not even a thought like-

01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:25.320
But you know why he does, and this is what I tweeted to you

01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.360
in one of the few things I think you have retweeted

01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:28.200
that I sent you.

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.080
I said, someday you're gonna give that to somebody.

01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:32.600
And today I want that to be me.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.440
No, no.

01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:36.440
Joe's omega.

01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:40.960
No, but the point is, he sees in you that same grandiosity,

01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.000
that same genuine spirit graciousness.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.840
And I think that's true.

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:45.440
I mean, you do do something very rare.

01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:47.280
I don't want to turn this into too much of a love fest,

01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.960
but I do want to say, even back to Andrew,

01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.800
who I've almost been hagiographic about,

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.200
just treating him like a saint.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:56.960
He said to me the same thing, and at a moment of peak,

01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.560
said like, God damn it, I have to train these guys

01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:02.480
and women that work for me,

01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:04.240
so that they can be better than me,

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:06.320
so that they can go out and compete with me

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:08.920
for the same limited amount of funding from the F-ing NSL.

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.080
You know, that wasn't his, that wasn't who he was.

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.080
That was just an expression,

01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:16.480
like I'm doing something which is fundamentally,

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.000
but you know what, when you have kids,

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.960
hopefully, you know, please God, you will someday.

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:22.680
Because I think, and I hope we can get to talk

01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:26.080
about that later, but part of investment

01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.600
and part of doing something when you have a kid,

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:30.480
like you can get married.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:33.480
You can marry someone because she's rich, or he's rich,

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.120
you can marry someone because they're good looking,

01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:36.320
or he's good looking.

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:37.960
You can marry for all these different reasons

01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:40.000
that are ultimately selfish.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.920
There's no way you can have a kid and be selfish.

01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:43.160
Nobody says like, oh, you know what,

01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:45.000
I really want this thing that's three feet tall

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.120
that doesn't speak English, that craps on my floor,

01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.560
that wakes me up all hours of the night,

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:50.080
that interferes my love life.

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:52.160
Nobody says that, because it doesn't benefit you

01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.080
for months and months.

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.160
A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me

01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:57.200
and does a lot of my solo videos,

01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.360
he's having his first kid, he's like, what do I do?

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:01.680
Because it always gets stupid if I'll catch up on sleep now.

01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.360
Like, yeah, I'm gonna store sleep in my sleep bank.

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:06.200
Like, I don't think Huberman and you talked about that,

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:07.040
right?

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.080
You can't do that, that's stupid.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.840
What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby,

01:59:10.840 --> 01:59:11.800
let the mother relax.

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.080
Like, in other words, do the things,

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:16.400
and this really relates back to what Aristotle once said.

01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.960
Aristotle once said, why do parents love kids

01:59:18.960 --> 01:59:20.800
more than kids love parents?

01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.760
As much as you love your dad and your mom,

01:59:22.760 --> 01:59:24.600
they still love you more.

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.160
And because you love that which you sacrifice for.

01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.760
Here's a proof.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.440
I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:35.040
Some with severe, one of my uncles on the Keating side

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:37.480
had severe what they called mental retardation now,

01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:39.240
it's probably has a different name.

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:42.800
That out of the nine other brothers and sisters,

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.400
he was their favorite,

01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:46.920
because they had to sacrifice so much for him.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:49.080
And I think of that, you know, in the small case,

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.160
like Joe is kind of mentoring you or whatever,

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.120
you're gonna mentor someone else.

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:54.400
You love that which you sacrifice for.

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.480
Sacrifice is reduction of entropy,

01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:58.120
it's storing and investing,

01:59:58.120 --> 01:59:59.560
and you wanna protect that.

01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:02.240
And that to me really speaks to this.

02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:04.320
So I don't hold it against, but it is true.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:07.720
Like scientists are, when they're described again,

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.240
they're often said to be like children, right?

02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:10.120
You've heard this description.

02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:12.360
They're inquisitive, they're curious, they're passionate.

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.200
They love that.

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.360
And I'm like, yeah, and they don't play well with others.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.640
They're jealous, they're petty, they're selfish.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:18.120
They won't share their ball and they'll go home.

02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:19.840
There's no such thing as a single edged sword.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.160
I wish there were, because we need some more of that

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.600
because you gotta dull it up.

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:27.320
But in this case, he, you know,

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:32.080
I think when you have this kind of investment in science,

02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:33.640
it's gonna be natural.

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.280
But that doesn't mean we have to like, you know,

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.680
feed the flames of competition.

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.840
You know, I'm like really,

02:00:38.840 --> 02:00:40.880
if you go to the homepage of the NSF

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.280
or the Department of Energy

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:45.160
or the recently released National Academy of Sciences

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:48.480
Future of Science for the Astronomical Sciences

02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.920
for the next 25 years or more,

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.360
they talk about how many Nobel prizes

02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.080
these different science things could win.

02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:57.040
Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB,

02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:59.520
B-mode polarization, the nice, you know,

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:01.840
that's figure two in this thing.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.680
And I'm like, what message does that send to kids,

02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:05.400
like to young people?

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:06.680
Like that's what you should be doing

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:07.880
so that you win this small, as you said,

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.080
this prize given out by one hairless ape to another

02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:11.920
wearing a fancier costume, eating reindeer.

02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.000
Especially in the case of Nobel Prize,

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.320
it's only currently given to three people.

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:17.480
At most, which was never one of his stipulate.

02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:19.800
He actually said one, you can only give it to one person.

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:21.360
So they change it, why do they change it?

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:22.720
I talk about, I speculate in the book.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.680
By the way, the book's only three chapters out of 11

02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:27.400
about the Nobel Prize and its effect.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.440
But you know, one of the things that's been so interesting,

02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.880
like I'm speaking, actually this coming up in December

02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:35.040
is that the Nobel Prize is given out

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.560
on the day of Alfred Nobel's death.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:40.000
There's a lot of, and they bring in flowers,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.560
not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,

02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:47.240
which is in San Romino in Italy.

02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.200
It's a lot of like death fascination, you know,

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:51.760
denial of death features heavily in the Nobel Prize

02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.160
because it's like, what outlives a person?

02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:55.720
Well, science can outlive a person.

02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:57.360
My father has a theorem named after him.

02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:01.160
It's still engraved in many places around the world.

02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:03.120
You or I, we can go to different places around the world.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.480
People know who we are based on our publications.

02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.120
We engrave things, we wanna store things,

02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:08.400
we wanna compress things.

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:10.840
And I think there's something beautiful about that,

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.560
but there is a notion of denial of death.

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.200
Like there is a notion of what will outlast me,

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.160
especially if you're among the many,

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:19.600
90 something percent of members of the National Academy

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:21.840
and don't believe in an active faith,

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.000
you know, in a creator, in a God.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.080
And science can substitute for that,

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.160
but it's not ultimately as fulfilling.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:33.440
I just, I don't believe it can fulfill a person

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.440
the way even practicing, but not believing in a religion

02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.320
can fulfill a person.

02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:40.920
So, which is interesting,

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.560
because you do bring up Ernest Becker

02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:45.480
and the denial of death in losing the Nobel Prize,

02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:50.480
but in there is a sense in which that's probably in part

02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:54.320
at the core of this, especially later dream

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:57.120
of the Nobel Prize or a prize or recognition.

02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:00.880
I've interacted with a few, you know,

02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:04.520
or a large number of scientists that are getting up in age

02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:09.240
and there is the feeling of real pride of happiness

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:14.240
in them from winning awards and getting certain recognitions.

02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.520
And probably the core of that is a kind of a mortality

02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:23.520
or a kind of desire for a mortality.

02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:28.720
And that was always off-putting to me as opposed to,

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:32.320
I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it's off-putting,

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.320
but it just, rather than celebrating the pure joy

02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:43.440
of solving the puzzles of the mystery

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:45.640
is all around us.

02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.640
Just the actual exploration of the mysterious.

02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.440
For its own sake.

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.920
For its own sake, yeah.

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.440
Well, that's why I said, you know, it's like a scientist

02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.520
should, okay, you have to be careful and not have any,

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.440
you know, physical, it has to be platonic,

02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:05.960
but you can think of scientists and mentor.

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:08.240
I have a chart in the book and in a plaque made

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.200
by one of my graduate students, former graduate students.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:13.440
She's now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron.

02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:16.600
And she made this plaque and it has 17 generations.

02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:19.240
So here I am, 17, you know, levels down.

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:21.320
There's a guy, Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz,

02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:24.160
different Leibniz, 1596, he was born.

02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:25.800
And I'm in this chain.

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.440
And I don't know if you know this,

02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:28.680
but in the Russian language,

02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:31.600
the word scientist means someone who was taught.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:32.720
I'll say it very simply.

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:33.960
One who was taught, right?

02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:34.800
Hachonny.

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.640
Hachonny.

02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.160
So it probably means a guy was taught, right?

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.000
No.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:39.840
A kid just being a person.

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:42.920
No, no, no, it's literally someone who was taught.

02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:43.920
Someone who was taught, right.

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.760
So what does that mean?

02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.560
To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning.

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:50.800
One is that you have to be a good student to be a scientist

02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:52.640
because you have to learn from somebody else.

02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:53.680
Two, you have to be a teacher.

02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:55.200
You have to pay it forward.

02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:58.600
If you don't, I claim you're really not a scientist

02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:00.200
in the truer sense.

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:01.640
And I feel like with the work that I do

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:04.320
in outreach and stuff like that, I'm doing it at scale.

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:07.120
I'm influencing more than the 24 kids I might have

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.360
in my graduate class or undergraduate class.

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.320
And you know, potentially could reach thousands

02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.160
of people around the world

02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.000
and make them into scientists themselves

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.080
because that's the flywheel that is only beneficial.

02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:20.440
There is no competition.

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:24.960
There is no zero sum fixed mindset versus growth mindset

02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:26.440
because it is an infinite game.

02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:29.280
Imagine a culture that had none of the trappings

02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:31.000
of the negativity of the Soviet Union

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.320
or pre-World War I Germany or Imperial Japan.

02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:37.480
You know, science celebrated

02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:40.400
and we're just making like a nation of scientists.

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:42.880
We're not doing it to become multi-billionaires

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:47.040
or necessarily for any military purpose whatsoever.

02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:49.520
But if we had that, you know, sometimes I'm flying home

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:52.000
at night, like when you fly into LA,

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:53.080
you literally, it's very rare.

02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.840
You can see like the number 10 million.

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:57.200
Like it's very hard to like visualize things.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:58.840
You see a brick wall, you ask how many bricks are there?

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:01.720
It might be a thousand, two thousand, 10 million lights.

02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:03.320
There's 10 million souls.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.920
And you can see, and they're discreet.

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.000
They're not like the Milky Way all blending together.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.920
Each lost in their own busy lives, excited, fall in love,

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.880
afraid of losing their job, all that.

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:16.000
By the way, people should know that you're a pilot.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.680
So you literally mean fly.

02:06:17.680 --> 02:06:19.200
Yeah, sometimes I get to do it.

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:22.960
You get to look at the eye of God perspective

02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:27.080
on these 10 million, on these millions of hairless apes.

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:29.160
They're like constellations, but upside down.

02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:31.480
Like the city, it's like a, hopefully I'll stay

02:06:31.480 --> 02:06:32.560
and keep the plane the right way up.

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:33.680
But when you think about it,

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.240
like imagine they're all working together

02:06:36.240 --> 02:06:38.320
and imagine like you always talk about love.

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:42.040
But like, you don't know that they're not worthy of love.

02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.360
Like, so you're looking down on them and it's just amazing.

02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:47.120
Cause you think like, what an amazing creation

02:06:47.120 --> 02:06:49.560
is man and humans and what can we do?

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:50.640
It's phenomenal.

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:52.120
It's so exciting.

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.440
And then I get to do it, you know,

02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:55.280
it's a job I say, don't tell Gavin Newsom,

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.120
but I do it for free.

02:06:56.120 --> 02:06:57.840
You know, I love what I do.

02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:01.160
And, but to think about like, oh, if my student succeeds

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:04.360
and I'm not, no, it is unfortunate

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:05.600
that you have experienced it.

02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:06.840
I've certainly experienced it.

02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:09.000
And I think there are ways around it.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.200
I think it is, it is a vexing problem

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.560
because people want to, you know,

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.160
it's very tempting to keep your own kind of, you know,

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:18.000
garden fertilized.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.040
You know, one thing that's interesting is like, you know,

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.520
people are like, why are you doing this thing?

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:23.560
And podcasts and you're supposed to be, you know,

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:25.440
serious scientists leading this huge project

02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:27.800
and collaborators.

02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:30.320
And I'm like, well, most of what I do, as I said before,

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.680
it's yeah, for you, it's Velcro.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:33.240
For me, it's like, you know,

02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.760
what is the deal with the safety standards on the truck

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:38.640
that we're driving up to deliver the diesel fuel

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:39.640
that will power the generator,

02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:40.960
that will allow the concrete truck to,

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:43.240
it has nothing to do with the big bang inflation,

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:45.160
the multiverse, God's existence.

02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:46.000
It has nothing to do with that, right?

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.560
So those are people I say I have to talk to.

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.800
The people that come on the show,

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:51.440
those are people I want to talk to.

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:52.360
And that's super fun.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:55.360
I mean, it's a real honor that I get to do it.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:57.560
I'm using, I have some unfair advantages, right?

02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:58.640
I'm at a top university.

02:07:58.640 --> 02:07:59.760
We have people that's affiliated

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:02.200
with the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation, you know,

02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:04.520
brilliant scientists coming through.

02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:06.920
But I felt like it would be kind of a shame

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:09.880
if I didn't, you know, allow them to teach at scale

02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:11.880
because they're better teachers than I am.

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:16.640
Let me ask you an interesting, maybe difficult question.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:21.360
Have you ever considered talking on your podcast

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.480
with the people who would get the Nobel Prize for BICEP2

02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:28.240
if it turned out to be detecting what it is?

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:30.320
Yeah, I mean, I'm still friends with them

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:32.080
and they have still gone on to.

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:34.640
So we should say like why we didn't win the Nobel Prize

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.840
and then what happened with the group

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:40.200
that is now leading it completely,

02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:43.640
that I'm completely divorced from in a secular sense.

02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:45.760
We're friends, you know, we see each other,

02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:48.280
you know, we send each other emails and stuff like that.

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:49.960
I would love to get their sense of like

02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:54.360
what the natural heartbreak built into the whole process

02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.160
of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is.

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:58.880
I would love to hear an honest, real conversation.

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.840
I understand you're friends,

02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.520
there's some hard truth that even friends

02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:03.360
will talk about it till you put a mic.

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.200
They weren't happy I wrote the book.

02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:06.000
I mean, I remember one of them, you know,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.920
was like, well, what's this I hear about a book?

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.240
And I mean, a lot of people told me not to write the book.

02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:11.880
They said it's gonna give, you know,

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.440
too much attention to the Nobel Prize,

02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:15.200
it's gonna look like sour grapes.

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.800
Again, I say you can prove I have sour grapes or not,

02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:18.960
just give me the next prize.

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.800
No.

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:21.920
So you would, if you get a Nobel Prize for Literature,

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.120
you would turn it down?

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:24.240
I don't know.

02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:26.400
It's funny because Sabina Hassenfelder,

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:30.120
who is a fellow kind of YouTube sensation

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.360
and a shoe in for the Nobel Peace Prize.

02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.360
You're right, she's so gracious and so good.

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:40.360
She has that German, you know, just gentleness.

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:43.240
She's a little too nice for my taste, I would say.

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.640
I wish she could really say what she thinks

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.480
and be snarky on occasion.

02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.720
So she wrote a review of my book when it came out

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:49.920
three or four years ago.

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:53.040
And she said, well, you know, Brian Keating,

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.800
like she said, well, it's, you know, it's good.

02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.040
It's interesting, he talks a lot about cosmology,

02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:00.040
but, you know, they can do whatever the hell they want.

02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.320
And he, you know, presumably has these, you know,

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:03.880
problems with it, but it's none of his business.

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:05.240
Basically, it's a private.

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:07.280
And at the end she said, but, you know,

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.560
if you want one good thing, he's a really good writer.

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:10.560
And, you know, who knows?

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:12.600
He could win the Nobel Prize in Literature or something.

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:14.640
I said, and then she allowed me to publish a rebuttal

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.840
on her blog, which was kind of funny.

02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:18.680
But anyway, no, so getting back to the guys

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:21.360
that we were, you know, kind of collaboratemies

02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:24.520
or frenemies and we're still, look, you know,

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.440
we don't wish each other active, ill.

02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:27.400
I've visited them.

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.600
They're welcome to visit me.

02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:30.000
They have visited me.

02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:32.800
And so the thing I have to say is that

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.960
I just wonder about introspection.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.880
Like for me, literally, I don't care about the Nobel Prize

02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:43.400
other than what it can do to, you know, benefit science.

02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.360
But I no longer, I did, but by the way,

02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:47.040
I did seriously care about how it would benefit

02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:48.840
Brian Keating early on in my career.

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.000
I'm just totally honest.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.440
I'm not proud of it.

02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:52.880
It's kind of embarrassing.

02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.840
But now I would hope that people would say,

02:10:54.840 --> 02:10:57.000
like, okay, the guy is like, you know,

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.160
he's obsessed with it.

02:10:58.160 --> 02:10:59.880
My next book is not about this.

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:03.000
And, you know, I do feel like people

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.320
lack introspection a lot of times in science.

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.520
Like we don't think about why we're doing what we're doing.

02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.720
And I think it comes down to curiosity.

02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:13.640
One thing about Joe, and again,

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:16.280
I've only listened to like, I have to confess.

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.440
You know, you're like my father.

02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:18.640
Now I'm confessing my sins.

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:19.480
It's you, Father Lex.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:20.320
Go on.

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:21.640
Father Fridman.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.360
I haven't listened to like that many of your episodes

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:25.520
start to finish, okay?

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.080
I'm with our friend, a mutual friend, Eric.

02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:28.840
I've listened to a bunch of recent ones.

02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:33.200
A bunch of great, Einstein, Weinstein.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:35.440
Weinstein, Weinstein, that's what it is.

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:36.280
You've had three Weinsteins.

02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:38.160
I get them confused with a brother.

02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:40.200
The brother's Karamazov, the brother's Weinstein.

02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:41.040
And a few others.

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.960
I haven't ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode.

02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:45.760
But from what I've seen with him,

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.360
he has a preternatural curiosity.

02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:49.280
He doesn't have passion.

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:50.720
There are a lot of podcasts about passion.

02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.200
Like I've been on their show.

02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:53.040
He has curiosity.

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:55.280
Like he's not gonna stop talking about something

02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:57.280
until he hops it, until he understands it,

02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.120
until he gets it this early.

02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:00.320
And I respect that.

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.880
Because as I say in this more recent book,

02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:05.400
passion's like kind of like the dopamine hit

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.240
that gets you started.

02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:07.640
It's like, oh, I'm gonna be great.

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:08.560
Maybe I could win a Nobel Prize.

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:10.720
Like that's not gonna sustain you.

02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.240
The sustenance comes from the passion

02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:15.200
converting to curiosity.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:18.640
And what I wanna do is convert as many things as possible

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:20.120
to things that I can then,

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.040
because actually I've had on people that discuss addiction.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:25.720
And there is an addictive quality

02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:28.360
to doing podcasts or whatever.

02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.360
But there's an addictive quality being a scientist.

02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:33.360
And you get to do things that are very specialized

02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:36.160
and specialized locations with special people

02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:38.600
paid for by other people who have no fricking idea

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:39.440
what you do.

02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:41.760
I mean, imagine you worked in some job

02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.760
and Feynman said, he said all these contradictory things.

02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:47.200
Like when he was once said like,

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.400
he said, if you can't explain it to your grandmother,

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.000
you don't understand it yourself.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.200
Then the day he won the Nobel Prize,

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:53.480
a reporter asked him, what'd you win it for?

02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:55.280
He said, if I could explain it to you, bud,

02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.520
it wouldn't be worth a Nobel prize.

02:12:56.520 --> 02:12:58.960
So let's leave aside his inherent contradictions.

02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:02.680
But in reality, there is a kind of like dopamine rush

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:03.560
that you get from it.

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:07.640
But what is ultimately gonna be the sustenance of it?

02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:11.520
So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:12.480
to nucleate that.

02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:14.800
I don't know actually, I don't know if it's like,

02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:16.800
can you turn someone into a,

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.200
I used to ask this question all the time.

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:21.360
Like, can you make someone creative?

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.000
Like, can you teach someone to be creative?

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:23.880
I don't know.

02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:26.400
Can you teach someone to be curious?

02:13:26.400 --> 02:13:27.240
I don't know.

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:29.400
I do know that kids are naturally curious.

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.440
As they get older, they get less curious.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:34.360
Just like I heard from the other forward authors,

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:38.000
James Altucher, he said, once they did a study,

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.520
kids smile 300 times a day or smile or laugh.

02:13:40.520 --> 02:13:43.400
Adults, five or six, five or six.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:44.600
No, I'm just trying to get you to laugh,

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:45.680
but you're not gonna laugh.

02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:46.520
But anyway, no, it's true.

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.040
So somewhere you lose 30, you know, to 50%.

02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:52.160
I'm not entertained, but that's because I'm an adult.

02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:54.960
No, and then I do remember there's some distribution

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:57.760
on those studies with a happier adult smile a little more,

02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:59.760
but still the kids blow them out of the water.

02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:00.600
Just crush it.

02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:02.520
So can you, is it, or in other words,

02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.680
should we invest our energy in getting the half-life decay

02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:09.640
constant stretched out more for curiosity for kids?

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.640
Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit and then,

02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:13.480
you know, I don't know.

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:14.320
It's an open question.

02:14:14.320 --> 02:14:17.360
Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace,

02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:19.280
the key to life is to be unborable.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.640
I think you could train this kind of thing,

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:25.320
which is in every single situation.

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.760
So like, which I think is at the core,

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.800
at least this correlated with curiosity,

02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.800
is in every situation, try to find

02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:38.840
the exciting, the fascinating, like in every situation.

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:40.920
You sitting at the, I don't know,

02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:43.920
waiting for something at a DMV or something like that.

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.960
Find something that excites you, like a thought,

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.320
like watch people or start to think about,

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:53.560
well, I wonder how many people

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.720
have to go to the DMV every day.

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:59.680
And they try to go into the pothead mode of thinking like,

02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:02.080
wow, isn't this weird that there's a bunch of people

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:05.480
that are having to get a stamp of approval

02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:07.600
from the government to drive their cars

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:09.560
and then there's millions of cars driving every day.

02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.480
Or like, how can I do this better?

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.400
Maybe there's some blockchain and they could like,

02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:14.200
VIN transfer, yeah, exactly, yeah.

02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.680
No, that is a good, that is cool.

02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.320
And then every situation, I think if you rigorously

02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:21.480
just practice that at a young age,

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.000
I think you can learn to do that.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:26.240
Because sometimes people ask me for advice

02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:29.760
and like, to do this thing or that thing is,

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:33.840
I think you at the core really have to have this muscle

02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:36.680
of finding the awesomeness in everything.

02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:38.600
Because if you're able to find the awesomeness

02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:40.960
in everything, like whatever journey you take,

02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:45.960
whatever weird that you take through life

02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:48.240
is going to be productive,

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.680
is gonna end up in a great place.

02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:52.440
So like that muscle is at the core of it.

02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:57.040
I guess curiosity is central to that.

02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:02.200
But you didn't win the Nobel Prize,

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.680
the team of Bicep that led the Bicep too

02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:10.280
didn't win the Nobel Prize because of some space dust.

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.560
That's right, let's make schmutz.

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:16.080
Which one is the moon, which one is?

02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:18.920
That one's the dust, the space dust, yeah.

02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:21.680
What are we looking at?

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.960
So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?

02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:27.920
Well, it's funny, I wrote these books

02:16:27.920 --> 02:16:28.760
and I don't know about you,

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:29.760
but when you get all these books,

02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:31.600
I'm sure you get books, people send you books.

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.480
They always come in these dust jackets, right?

02:16:33.480 --> 02:16:35.160
I was always like, what the hell is a dust jacket?

02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:38.240
Like how much dust is raining down at any moment?

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.320
I mean, this is immaculate,

02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.560
this room is Russian tidiness galore.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.240
But in a normal household, how much dust is raining down?

02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:47.360
It's not really, until I wrote a book

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:49.600
and I realized I'm writing a story

02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:51.560
about the origin of the universe,

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.300
now the prologue to the cosmos,

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:57.480
and dust is going to cover this story.

02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:59.440
It was actually, it's actually more a story

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:02.360
about astrophysics and cosmology than dust.

02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.480
And this is the link between the cosmological

02:17:05.480 --> 02:17:06.320
and the astrophysical.

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.220
So what does that mean?

02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.140
So astrophysics is broadly speaking,

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:12.020
the study of physical phenomena manifest

02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:14.900
in the heavens, astronomical phenomena.

02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:17.240
Cosmology is concerned with the origin, evolution,

02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:18.840
composition of the universe as a whole,

02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:21.420
but it's not really concerned with stars, galaxies,

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:23.740
and planets per se, other than how they might help us

02:17:23.740 --> 02:17:26.820
measure the Hubble constant, the density of the universe,

02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:29.300
the neutrino content, et cetera, et cetera.

02:17:29.300 --> 02:17:31.940
So we have a tendency to kind of look a little bit,

02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:34.180
they're like not all astronomers

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:35.420
and astrophysicists are equal.

02:17:35.420 --> 02:17:37.420
They're all equal, but some are more equal than others.

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:40.040
So we have kind of a prejudice, a little swagger, right?

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:41.460
And cosmologists are studying, you know,

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:43.560
we're using Einstein, we're not using like, you know,

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:46.880
Boltzmann, we're thinking of the biggest possible pictures.

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:49.900
In so doing, you can actually become blinded

02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:53.980
to otherwise obvious effects that people, you know,

02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:55.980
would have not overlooked.

02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:58.620
In our case, when we sought out the signal,

02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:01.140
we were using the photons that make up

02:18:01.140 --> 02:18:03.740
this primordial heat bath that surrounds the universe,

02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:06.380
luckily only at three degrees Kelvin, approximately.

02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:08.260
We're using those as a type of film

02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.220
onto which gravitational waves will reverberate it,

02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:14.060
make them oscillate preferentially in a polarized way.

02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:16.180
And then we can use our polarized sunglasses,

02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:18.180
but in a microwave format,

02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:20.940
to detect the characteristic twofold symmetry pattern

02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:22.480
of under rotation.

02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:24.220
That's the technical way that we undergo it.

02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:26.220
I mean, there's a lot more to it.

02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:27.900
But there are more than one thing

02:18:27.900 --> 02:18:29.620
that can mimic exactly that signal.

02:18:29.620 --> 02:18:31.780
First of all, when you look at the signal,

02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:33.500
the signal, if inflation took place,

02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:35.900
big if, but if it took place,

02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:39.900
the signal would be about one or two parts per billion

02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:43.060
of the CMB temperature itself.

02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:47.000
So a few nano Kelvin, the CMB is a few Kelvin,

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.540
the signal from these B modes would be a few nano Kelvin.

02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:52.220
It's astonishing to think,

02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:54.380
Penzies and Wilson, 1965,

02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:58.020
measured something that's a billion times brighter.

02:18:58.020 --> 02:18:59.900
And that was what, 60 years ago,

02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:02.540
let's call it 60 years ago since they discovered it.

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.420
Moore's law, you're more expert,

02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.980
let's call it every two years.

02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.540
So you're talking about like two to the 30th power,

02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:10.660
doubling or something like that at that.

02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:12.620
So let's call it two to the 20th, something like that.

02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:17.140
So that's like only two to the 10th is a thousand, right?

02:19:17.140 --> 02:19:18.260
Correct my math, I'm wrong.

02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:20.420
Two to the 20th is a million, right?

02:19:20.420 --> 02:19:22.020
Two to the 30th is a billion.

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:25.460
So we're outpacing Moore's law

02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:27.540
in terms of the sensitivity of our instruments

02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:30.380
to detect these feeble signals from the cosmos.

02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:31.900
And they don't have to deal with,

02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:35.220
the semiconductor fabric factory in Santa Clara, California.

02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:36.540
They don't have to deal with like,

02:19:36.540 --> 02:19:39.740
meteorites and things like coming into the laboratory.

02:19:39.740 --> 02:19:41.140
It's a clean room, it's pristine.

02:19:41.140 --> 02:19:42.740
They can control everything about it, right?

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:44.660
We can't control the cosmos.

02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:46.420
And the cosmos is literally littered

02:19:46.420 --> 02:19:48.940
with particles of schmutz of failed planets,

02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:51.180
asteroids, meteoroids,

02:19:51.180 --> 02:19:54.700
things that didn't call us to make either the earth,

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:57.500
the moon, the planet Jupiter or its moons,

02:19:57.500 --> 02:19:59.780
or get sucked into them and make craters on them,

02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:00.940
et cetera, et cetera.

02:20:00.940 --> 02:20:02.380
The rest of it is falling

02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:04.220
and it comes in a power spectrum.

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:05.580
There's very few, thank God,

02:20:05.580 --> 02:20:09.340
Chicxulub sized impact or progenitors

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:11.820
that will take out all life on earth.

02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:14.980
But there's extremely large number of tiny dust particles

02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:16.380
and microscopic grains.

02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:17.540
And then there's a fair number

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.700
of intermediate sized particles.

02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:21.940
It turns out this little guy here

02:20:21.940 --> 02:20:26.700
is the end product of a collapsing star

02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:28.460
that explodes in what's called a supernova,

02:20:28.460 --> 02:20:30.100
type two supernova.

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:31.820
So stars spend most of their life

02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:36.820
using helium nuclei protons and neutrons into helium nuclei.

02:20:38.900 --> 02:20:40.740
And then from there it can make other things

02:20:40.740 --> 02:20:43.820
like beryllium and briefly make beryllium and carbon,

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:45.620
nitrogen, oxygen, all the way up

02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:48.700
until it tries to make iron and nickel.

02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:50.660
Iron and nickel are endothermic.

02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:52.780
It takes more energy than gets liberated

02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:55.860
to make an atom of iron.

02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:58.060
When that happens, there's no longer enough heat

02:20:58.060 --> 02:21:01.420
supplying pressure to resist the gravitational collapse

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:02.940
of the material that was produced earlier.

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:04.940
So the star forms, it goes inside out.

02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:07.020
That's how scientists discovered

02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.540
helium was discovered on the sun.

02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:09.380
I don't know, did you know?

02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:10.620
That's why it's called helium.

02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:12.020
Yeah, they went there at night.

02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:13.300
And-

02:21:13.300 --> 02:21:14.140
Oh, well done.

02:21:14.140 --> 02:21:14.980
They went there at night.

02:21:14.980 --> 02:21:16.740
No, helium means heliosis, the god of the sun.

02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:18.420
It was discovered in its spectrum

02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:20.940
from observations of the telescope like 150 years ago.

02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:23.100
It wasn't discovered like when oxygen

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:25.540
and iron was discovered.

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.460
So it's only a relatively recent comer to the pure activity.

02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:31.220
So helium came after oxygen.

02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:33.820
Oh no, first hydrogen forms into helium.

02:21:33.820 --> 02:21:34.980
So that's the first thing that formed.

02:21:34.980 --> 02:21:36.340
No, in terms of discoveries.

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:37.420
Oh yeah, after oxygen.

02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:40.340
Yeah, I think Priestley and others,

02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:42.900
Dalton discovered it in the 1700s.

02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:44.300
No, helium was really only discovered

02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:45.900
from the spectrum of looking at the sun

02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:47.580
and seeing the weird atomic absorption

02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:51.380
and called Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum.

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:53.900
So, but when it tries to make iron,

02:21:53.900 --> 02:21:55.620
there's no longer any leftover heat.

02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:57.860
In other words, there's heat leftover from fusing,

02:21:57.860 --> 02:21:59.740
as you know, the son of a plasma physicist.

02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:02.340
He fused to a hydrogen nuclei.

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.420
You get excess energy, plus you get helium.

02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:06.900
So that's why fusion energy could be the energy source

02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:08.460
of the future and always will be.

02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.420
No, no, hopefully it'll come much sooner than that.

02:22:11.420 --> 02:22:13.980
And so doing, trying to make iron, it takes more energy,

02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:16.620
doesn't give off enough energy, star collapses, explodes.

02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:17.940
And what does it spray out

02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:20.300
into the cosmic interstellar medium?

02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:22.820
It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff.

02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.180
Luckily for us, because some of that coalesced

02:22:25.180 --> 02:22:27.780
and made the core of the earth onto which the lighter,

02:22:27.780 --> 02:22:30.220
like silica and carbon and the dirt

02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:31.540
and the crust of the earth were formed.

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:33.660
And some of that made its way to the crust.

02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:35.420
The iron made its way to the crust.

02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:36.980
Some of that your mother ate

02:22:36.980 --> 02:22:39.540
and synthesized hemoglobin molecules.

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:41.420
And hemoglobin has iron particles in it.

02:22:41.420 --> 02:22:43.140
It's a quite amazing substance.

02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:44.820
Without it, we wouldn't have our red blood.

02:22:44.820 --> 02:22:47.380
We wouldn't exist as we are.

02:22:47.380 --> 02:22:49.900
Is this a very long, complicated mom joke?

02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:53.780
I've done enough dad jokes, my quote is up.

02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:57.100
So I'm taking this object seriously.

02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:59.260
There's not all of it gets bound up in a planet.

02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:01.620
In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.

02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:03.620
And so there's a lot of schmutz left over,

02:23:03.620 --> 02:23:06.580
some of which gets in the way of our telescopes

02:23:06.580 --> 02:23:08.580
looking back to the beginning of time.

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.380
And some of those molecules like iron

02:23:10.380 --> 02:23:12.100
is used in compass needles, right?

02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:15.620
They're magnetized and magnetic fields in our galaxy

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:18.140
can align them and make the exact polarization pattern

02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:19.620
that we're looking for.

02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:21.780
As if the compass needles get all aligned,

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:24.220
that's like the polarization of the dust grain.

02:23:24.220 --> 02:23:26.260
It's like that polarizing filter.

02:23:26.260 --> 02:23:29.060
That means light polarized like this will get absorbed

02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:30.900
and light polarized like this will go through.

02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:33.420
So it's absorbing, it's making 100% polarized light

02:23:33.420 --> 02:23:35.860
out of an initially unpolarized light source.

02:23:35.860 --> 02:23:36.900
And that's what happened.

02:23:36.900 --> 02:23:41.900
And what we ended up the claiming on March 17th.

02:23:42.300 --> 02:23:45.420
And I'm sure if you were there, you might remember this

02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:47.500
at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,

02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:48.340
there was an announcement.

02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:49.980
There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners

02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:50.980
in the audience.

02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:53.660
And the BICEP2 team, which I was no longer leading,

02:23:53.660 --> 02:23:55.380
I was still a member of it.

02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:56.300
In fact, in the announcement,

02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:59.020
the first person they mentioned besides,

02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:00.900
thank you all for being here as me

02:24:00.900 --> 02:24:02.500
and my team at UC San Diego.

02:24:02.500 --> 02:24:05.260
Although I wasn't invited to go to the press conference

02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:07.780
because that complicated.

02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:09.420
Yes, exactly.

02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:12.020
It's a little school up there in the Cambridge area.

02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:15.580
And so they ended up making this announcement

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:18.220
that we had discovered the aftershocks of inflation.

02:24:18.220 --> 02:24:21.900
We detected the gravitational waves shaking up the CMB.

02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:24.660
And on that day passed Lex Fridman podcast

02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.620
back when it was called Artificial Intelligence.

02:24:26.620 --> 02:24:30.300
Max Tegmark said, goodbye universe, hello multiverse

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:32.220
and hello Nobel Prize.

02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:35.220
So he saw that as confirmatory evidence,

02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:37.700
not only of inflation, not only gravitational waves,

02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:41.820
but of the multiverse, goodbye universe, hello multiverse.

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:44.500
Multiverse is a natural consequence.

02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:46.260
It's a consequence of inflation,

02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:48.660
according to its prominent supporters.

02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:51.940
Yeah, and of course, leave the poetry to Max,

02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:54.180
which he does masterfully.

02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:58.340
Okay, so that the excitement was there.

02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:02.860
I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you is there too.

02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:04.980
That's some of the darker moments you're going through,

02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:07.860
but broadly for the space of science,

02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:09.140
there's excitement there.

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:09.980
Huge excitement.

02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:13.500
And I often note that this is a problem in what I call

02:25:13.580 --> 02:25:15.100
science media complex,

02:25:15.100 --> 02:25:17.300
because oftentimes you'll see things like

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.460
past guest Sarah Seeger, Venus life exists.

02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:23.780
And that will be really, I mean, it's fascinating, right?

02:25:23.780 --> 02:25:24.820
And with the work that she's doing

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:26.580
or her colleagues are doing,

02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:28.220
Clara who was on your show as well.

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:31.340
And that will be on front page, New York Times,

02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:34.220
Boston Globe, San Diego Union Tribune.

02:25:34.220 --> 02:25:37.100
It'll be above the fold, make headlines around the world.

02:25:37.100 --> 02:25:39.180
And then six months, 12 months later,

02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:41.220
as is the case for us, retraction.

02:25:41.220 --> 02:25:45.260
Page C-17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads

02:25:45.260 --> 02:25:47.260
and underneath the personal.

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:49.900
So we have a problem in science that the,

02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:54.620
if it explodes, it leads, and we get this huge fanfare.

02:25:54.620 --> 02:25:56.900
And this is not unique to my experiment.

02:25:56.900 --> 02:25:58.620
This happened with the earlier discovery

02:25:58.620 --> 02:26:03.620
of so-called Martian life discovered in Antarctica,

02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:06.180
which was announced after peer review.

02:26:06.180 --> 02:26:07.620
We weren't peer reviewed at the point

02:26:07.620 --> 02:26:08.460
when we made the announcement.

02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:10.740
We had a press conference and there are other reasons

02:26:10.740 --> 02:26:12.980
that the team leaders felt it was important to do that

02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:15.860
so that we don't get scooped by a referee who's unethical.

02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:17.180
We thought we had done everything right,

02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:18.260
but that's confirmation bias.

02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:20.060
So there's like levels to this.

02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:21.780
Yeah, there were many levels.

02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:24.220
And there were people, me warning about

02:26:24.220 --> 02:26:26.740
how it would be interpreted and wanting to also make sure

02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:29.060
that we put all the data out, including the maps,

02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:30.380
which we still haven't released.

02:26:30.380 --> 02:26:33.100
And so there were a lot of reasons to be skeptical,

02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:36.860
but the public never knows this.

02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:39.380
I think it's, so I've made a rule that if I am ever

02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:43.020
in charge of doling out large amounts of science funding,

02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:45.580
that when you should keep kind of an option,

02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:47.940
in other words, you should have money for publicity,

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:50.260
it's fine, have money for your press conference,

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:54.220
but hold in reserve in a bond to be used, hopefully never,

02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:58.380
but if it's to be used, an equal fund for the retraction,

02:26:58.380 --> 02:26:59.900
if it should occur.

02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:01.740
So you would like to see,

02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:04.700
cause that's a big part of transparency is the,

02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:08.620
to me in the space of science at least,

02:27:08.620 --> 02:27:13.100
that's as beautiful, because it reveals the,

02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:15.220
it's like, it tells a great story.

02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:18.340
There's an excitement, there's a-

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:19.180
Humanity.

02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.660
So there's a climax to the triumph,

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:25.420
but there's also a climax to the disappointment at the end,

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:29.540
because that also eventually leads to triumph again.

02:27:29.540 --> 02:27:32.540
That sets up, that's the drama that sets up the triumph,

02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:34.940
like with Andrew Wiles bringing Fermat's last,

02:27:35.900 --> 02:27:38.860
Fermat's theorem, I guess it's not the last thing, whatever,

02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:43.580
the, is like the ups and downs of that, the rollercoaster,

02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:44.420
the whole thing should be documented.

02:27:44.420 --> 02:27:46.220
That is science, that is science,

02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:49.020
and when we don't do that, then we cultivate this aura

02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:51.060
that excludes other scientists,

02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.140
often from minorities or women,

02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:54.460
that you have to be Einstein,

02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:55.820
like Einstein came out of the womb,

02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:57.460
and he was just like this guy with like curly,

02:27:57.460 --> 02:28:00.220
no, he wasn't, he wasn't bad at math,

02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:01.740
that was all, that's all nonsense,

02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:03.580
but he said that he, you know when he said

02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:05.660
he attributed his success to Alex, he said,

02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:08.580
I never asked my dad what happened

02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:11.380
when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid,

02:28:11.380 --> 02:28:13.300
and thank God I didn't, because had I,

02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:15.580
he would have told me the best answer of the day,

02:28:15.580 --> 02:28:18.860
which by the way, you know, he would create 20 years later

02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:21.460
as a 26 year old in the patent office,

02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:24.180
obviously in Switzerland, and in so doing,

02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:26.100
by delaying when he asked these questions,

02:28:26.100 --> 02:28:28.660
he said, I approached it with the intellect

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:31.580
of a mature scientist, not a little kid,

02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:34.140
and I wouldn't have accepted the same explanation,

02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:37.380
so sometimes assuming that scientists are infallible,

02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:40.300
ineffable, omniscient, you know, being,

02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:41.700
I think that really does a disservice,

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:42.940
and Jim Gates said, you know, he's like,

02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:45.100
Einstein wasn't always Einstein,

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:48.060
and we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril,

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:51.780
because we're humans, until we have artificial Einstein,

02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:54.180
which I don't think will ever exist.

02:28:54.180 --> 02:28:58.060
You've launched the assayer project,

02:28:58.060 --> 02:28:59.660
where you hope to assess theories

02:28:59.700 --> 02:29:01.860
of everything with experiments.

02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:03.900
You have a YouTube video where you're announcing that,

02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:05.500
that looks super cool.

02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:07.860
Can you describe this project?

02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:09.100
And you also mentioned, kind of,

02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:11.980
you give a shout out to a little known fellow

02:29:11.980 --> 02:29:14.340
by the name of Galileo Galilei,

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:17.220
as an inspiration to this project.

02:29:17.220 --> 02:29:21.260
Yeah, so Galileo is kind of my avatar, my hero,

02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:23.100
kind of all around scientist

02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:27.660
that I would love to approach the logarithm of Galileo.

02:29:27.700 --> 02:29:31.060
He was not only a phenomenal scientist,

02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:36.060
he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet, a philosopher.

02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:38.300
And back then, they didn't have distinctions

02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:39.500
between, you know, scientist,

02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:42.980
and, you know, it was like a physician was like a physicist.

02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:44.940
And he would indulge, you know,

02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:48.220
kind of these really intellectual flights of fancy,

02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:52.540
thinking about phenomena, such as the Earth's tides,

02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:55.340
or the, you know, the composition of the Milky Way.

02:29:55.340 --> 02:29:57.180
And what's interesting about Galileo

02:29:57.180 --> 02:30:00.900
is that he was almost as wrong often as he was right.

02:30:00.900 --> 02:30:03.540
And Galileo was not alone like this.

02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:07.580
I always say like Einstein had at least seven Nobel prizes

02:30:07.580 --> 02:30:09.420
that he could have won for discoveries

02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:10.700
that later became true.

02:30:10.700 --> 02:30:13.860
But he also had seven, you know, huge, you know,

02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:16.980
impossible to believe blunders in some sense.

02:30:16.980 --> 02:30:17.820
And it's too bad,

02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:19.500
because he could have had a good career, as I would say.

02:30:19.500 --> 02:30:21.340
And Galileo was like that too.

02:30:21.340 --> 02:30:24.660
In other words, he would fall victim to, I think,

02:30:24.700 --> 02:30:27.180
this confirmation bias that all scientists

02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:29.780
have to guard their lives against, their careers,

02:30:29.780 --> 02:30:32.020
their brands, their reputations against,

02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:34.980
which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn't conform

02:30:34.980 --> 02:30:38.380
to what you're trying to prove for one reason or another,

02:30:38.380 --> 02:30:42.060
or the radical acceptance of things that do comport with it

02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:43.740
in order to bolster your confidence.

02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:45.660
And both are equally intoxicating.

02:30:45.660 --> 02:30:49.340
It's, you know, confirmation bias is a hell of a drug,

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:53.100
because it really, you know, reinforces this notion,

02:30:53.100 --> 02:30:54.580
which is partially sunk cost.

02:30:54.580 --> 02:30:57.500
You've put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.

02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:59.420
You don't want to be wrong and go back on it.

02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:04.420
And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive

02:31:04.980 --> 02:31:07.220
about things such as, you know,

02:31:07.220 --> 02:31:10.100
the earth being not located at the center

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:12.220
of the solar system and the sun being the center.

02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.220
It's called Copernican hypothesis.

02:31:15.180 --> 02:31:19.220
And he would use as evidence, very, very interesting ideas

02:31:19.220 --> 02:31:20.980
that all of which were wrong, basically.

02:31:20.980 --> 02:31:22.900
And in fact, we weren't able to prove

02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:25.100
that the earth orbited around the sun.

02:31:25.100 --> 02:31:28.420
And I ask you, like, can you prove the earth is not flat?

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.100
No, well, you're a flat earther anyway.

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:32.820
But I asked my grads-

02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:34.860
Crowd, Flat Earth Society member,

02:31:34.860 --> 02:31:36.860
t-shirts coming out soon,

02:31:36.860 --> 02:31:38.300
let's streamer.com

02:31:38.300 --> 02:31:39.140
Merch.

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:40.660
Merch.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:42.140
But it's actually not trivial to do that.

02:31:42.140 --> 02:31:43.620
But most of my students, graduate students,

02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:45.220
can prove that the earth is rounder.

02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:46.100
Explain how the earth-

02:31:46.100 --> 02:31:48.020
It is actually not trivial to do, though.

02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:49.060
It's not. Yeah.

02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:50.180
And much harder is to prove

02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:51.660
that the earth goes around the sun.

02:31:51.660 --> 02:31:53.220
In fact, that's extremely hard to prove.

02:31:53.220 --> 02:31:54.860
And almost none of my students,

02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:57.300
even after they get their PhD and the final exam,

02:31:57.300 --> 02:31:59.700
I kinda like to just give them a little bit of humility.

02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:01.380
Because I think to be a good scientist,

02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.300
you need to be humble,

02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:03.620
you need to have a little humility,

02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:05.140
and you need to have swagger.

02:32:05.140 --> 02:32:06.420
You need to feel like a little cocky.

02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:07.380
Like, I can do this.

02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:09.460
I can do this thing that Einstein, by definition,

02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:10.300
couldn't do.

02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:11.340
I'm gonna attempt it.

02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:13.620
I'm gonna attempt to do what was impossible

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:15.220
just a generation ago.

02:32:15.220 --> 02:32:18.500
How do you prove that the earth goes around the sun?

02:32:18.740 --> 02:32:22.180
Is it by the motion of other planets?

02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:23.380
So there are many ways to do it.

02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:24.780
I mean, obviously, you could take a spaceship,

02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:28.020
park it at the north celestial pole of our solar system,

02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:30.100
and just watch what happens.

02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:31.780
But obviously, that wasn't how it was discovered

02:32:31.780 --> 02:32:32.820
in the late 1700s.

02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:34.420
So it's called aberration.

02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:36.620
So if you look at stars,

02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:39.580
as the earth orbits around the sun,

02:32:39.580 --> 02:32:41.940
the position of the stars will shift slightly

02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:43.260
because of the tilt of the earth

02:32:43.260 --> 02:32:46.660
and because the earth is in motion around the sun,

02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:50.500
and because the earth has a non-trivial amount of velocity

02:32:50.500 --> 02:32:53.700
compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the sun,

02:32:53.700 --> 02:32:55.900
the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses,

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.500
and those will correspond to the fact

02:32:57.500 --> 02:32:59.180
that we're moving around,

02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:00.580
if they're at infinite distance,

02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:02.180
which we assume that they are, they're not really.

02:33:02.180 --> 02:33:03.740
But for all intents and purposes,

02:33:03.740 --> 02:33:04.740
on the scale of the solar system,

02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:06.100
they're infinitely far away.

02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:08.140
So that's called stellar aberration.

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:10.580
And that was the first way it was discovered.

02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:11.820
And actually, we still use that.

02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.260
We have to correct for that effect

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:16.060
when we measure the cosmic microwave background.

02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:18.380
Because imagine you're inside of an oven,

02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:19.220
it has some temperature,

02:33:19.220 --> 02:33:21.140
three Kelvin and a thousand Kelvin or whatever.

02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:22.740
If you're moving towards you,

02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:24.540
the photons that are coming to me in that direction

02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:26.180
will be blue-shifted, hotter,

02:33:26.180 --> 02:33:28.020
and the ones behind me will be red-shifted.

02:33:28.020 --> 02:33:31.620
I'll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount of matter

02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:32.620
or energy where you are,

02:33:32.620 --> 02:33:34.820
and it's an extension of the Doppler effect.

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:36.500
So we actually make use of that

02:33:36.500 --> 02:33:39.580
and construct what's called a local standard of rest.

02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:41.140
Anyway, so you can do it.

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:42.380
But Galileo said, no, no, no,

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:43.660
I'm not gonna wait for that.

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:45.820
I have other proofs for it.

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.860
One of which is that the Earth has tides,

02:33:47.860 --> 02:33:50.140
and the tides come in and out twice a day,

02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:51.460
high tide and low tide.

02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:53.460
And he made the analogy

02:33:53.460 --> 02:33:56.220
because the Earth is moving around the sun,

02:33:56.220 --> 02:33:57.460
say this is the sun here,

02:33:57.460 --> 02:33:58.900
and it's moving around the sun,

02:33:58.900 --> 02:34:00.500
but it's also rotating on its axis.

02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:02.420
See how the water is sloshing up and down

02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:04.780
inside the vodka bottle?

02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:06.900
As that happens, he said that's what the tides are caused by.

02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:07.740
Totally wrong.

02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:09.300
Most people listen to this podcast.

02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:12.340
Just so you know, if you're listening to this,

02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:14.820
he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:16.420
Half drunk.

02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:20.780
And we're both drunk and whatever else is possible.

02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:22.220
So as it sloshed around,

02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:23.980
he claimed that has nothing to do with that.

02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:26.460
The moon, over there,

02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:28.740
the moon pulls differentially

02:34:28.740 --> 02:34:30.700
on the Earth and the Earth's ocean.

02:34:30.700 --> 02:34:33.100
That causes the oceans to bulge slightly

02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:35.020
towards and away from where the moon is.

02:34:35.020 --> 02:34:37.460
And the moon is actually the source of the Earth's tides.

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:39.660
It has nothing to do with Copernicus,

02:34:39.660 --> 02:34:40.700
the orbit of the sun.

02:34:40.700 --> 02:34:42.460
So he was totally wrong about that.

02:34:42.500 --> 02:34:45.260
He also thought that the Milky Way was comprised

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:47.300
only of stars when we know it's made of gas,

02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:49.780
dust, nebulae, and things like that.

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:51.260
So he had a fair share of blunders.

02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.660
Now, one thing I always kind of make note of,

02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.420
and I'm actually producing along with Jim Gates,

02:34:57.420 --> 02:35:00.500
Fabiola Gianotti, Frank Wilczek,

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:04.020
and Carlo Rovelli and my friend Lucio Piccirillo,

02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:07.260
the first ever audio book of one of Galileo's dialogue,

02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:09.020
the one where he claimed to find evidence

02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:11.220
for the orbit of the Earth around the sun,

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:12.620
but it was an error.

02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:14.740
So you're reading parts of this text.

02:35:14.740 --> 02:35:16.540
Yeah, it's a brilliant book.

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:19.300
So this book was written in 1632.

02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:21.180
It was written and it was the one that caused him

02:35:21.180 --> 02:35:23.380
to go into house arrest and almost threatened

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:24.500
to be tortured.

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.540
And that book laid out his arguments

02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:29.500
for what was called the Copernican

02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:34.380
or the non-parapetetic Aristotelian, et cetera,

02:35:34.380 --> 02:35:37.180
notion of the planetary dynamic.

02:35:37.180 --> 02:35:39.820
And eventually he was forced to recant

02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:40.740
that he believed in it.

02:35:40.740 --> 02:35:43.780
And allegedly he said he still believes the Earth moves.

02:35:43.780 --> 02:35:45.580
Anyway, so we're making, it's written in the form

02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.420
of a trialogue.

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:48.740
It's actually called the dialogue with three people.

02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:50.420
There's one named Salviati,

02:35:50.420 --> 02:35:53.140
who was espousing Galileo's notions

02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.900
about how the heavens were orchestrated.

02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:58.260
And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.

02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:00.020
Then there's a middle man, Segredo.

02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:03.140
So Carlo Rovelli is playing Salviati, brilliant one.

02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:05.540
I am playing Segredo,

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.740
who's like an intelligent interlocutor.

02:36:08.260 --> 02:36:10.700
I'm kind of just, I can appreciate Aristotle.

02:36:10.700 --> 02:36:12.340
I can appreciate Copernicus.

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:15.220
Then there's this guy Simplicio, the simpleton.

02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:18.220
And he espouses the words of the Pope.

02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:19.540
So you can imagine like, you know,

02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:21.660
you're working in the Putin's government

02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:23.540
or you're working in whatever.

02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:26.980
And all of a sudden you're kind of putting the words

02:36:26.980 --> 02:36:29.780
of like the fool, literally calling the fool,

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:32.260
but you're using the words of the all supreme powerful

02:36:32.260 --> 02:36:35.260
being on earth at that time was the Vatican church,

02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:37.260
especially for an Italian like Galileo.

02:36:37.260 --> 02:36:39.340
So he wasn't as brilliant, you know,

02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:44.180
politically as he was astrophysically and otherwise.

02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:46.540
Who's doing Simplicio?

02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:48.220
So Simplicio is a friend of mine

02:36:48.220 --> 02:36:51.500
in University of Manchester named Lucio Picciorello.

02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:53.260
He's an Irish guy, but he has an Italian,

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:55.140
no, no, he's full-blooded Italian.

02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:57.140
But they all speak English and Italian.

02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:58.540
I only speak.

02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:00.380
And that four words are written by,

02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:03.340
so one forward and this place has three four words,

02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:04.940
which is like a 12 word.

02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:07.460
Okay.

02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:08.300
The four words are written by-

02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:09.140
Can you explain that joke for me?

02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:10.220
Yeah, that was a good one.

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:12.540
The four word, three four words.

02:37:12.540 --> 02:37:14.500
One of them is written by Albert Einstein

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:17.700
in which he says Galileo was not only

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:19.180
one of the greatest scientists in history,

02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:21.700
this is Einstein telling Galileo,

02:37:21.700 --> 02:37:23.820
but he was one of the greatest writers

02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:26.380
and minds of all of human history.

02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:29.500
That forward is read by Frank Wilczek, who you've had,

02:37:30.540 --> 02:37:31.660
Jim Gates, who you've also had.

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:35.060
He reads the translation, the translator,

02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:38.860
Stillman Drake is a renowned scientific translator.

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:42.580
And then Fabiola Giannotti, she reads the introduction

02:37:42.580 --> 02:37:46.740
and dedication from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany

02:37:46.740 --> 02:37:49.340
and some of the different introductions

02:37:49.340 --> 02:37:50.620
that Galileo himself had.

02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:53.020
It's just, it's such a thrill to be able to do it.

02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:56.460
I only randomly found out, because I wanted to study it

02:37:56.460 --> 02:37:58.220
and it's like 500 pages long.

02:37:58.220 --> 02:37:59.420
And I was like, let me get the audio book

02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:02.060
because I'm an audio medium kind of guy, didn't exist.

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:03.700
So I said, let's do it ourselves.

02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:05.460
And so we did it and hopefully it'll be out

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:09.500
on Galileo's birthday, which is February 15th, 2022.

02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:11.580
There'll be a ripe 457,

02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:13.500
but that's not the only one of his books.

02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:14.820
Galileo wrote many books,

02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:18.020
one of which is called the Military Compass.

02:38:18.020 --> 02:38:20.660
And this is an interesting book for my blockchain

02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:22.620
and your blockchain aficionados.

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.980
In this book, he talks about a compass,

02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:27.940
which is not a magnetic compass, but actual like slide roll.

02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:29.460
It's basically a slide roll.

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:31.460
And it's a manual.

02:38:31.460 --> 02:38:34.020
It's like, imagine if your phone came with a manual,

02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:35.060
nowadays they don't, right?

02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:38.100
But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll,

02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:39.780
which is like enormously important.

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:41.860
And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples.

02:38:41.860 --> 02:38:43.100
It's a brilliant book.

02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:45.420
One of the examples is how do you convert money?

02:38:45.420 --> 02:38:47.500
So he does a currency conversion

02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:51.740
between Ducati and Florentine Ducati and Scuti

02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:53.980
and whatever, Lyra, whatever.

02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:55.900
He does all these currency conversions.

02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:58.940
One copy of this book, or maybe two exist,

02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:02.220
first printings from 1600 still exist.

02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:06.100
If Galileo had just kept those in his family,

02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:08.740
they're worth a hundred million dollars.

02:39:08.740 --> 02:39:10.180
Nowadays, you can't get a Scuti.

02:39:10.180 --> 02:39:11.460
A Scuti is worth nothing.

02:39:11.460 --> 02:39:13.060
Like a Ducati is worth nothing.

02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:15.340
I mean, maybe some collector wants a piece of paper, right?

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:16.180
So it's a lesson.

02:39:16.180 --> 02:39:19.860
Like there are value in physical, non-fungible tokens,

02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:22.500
this original non-fungible token, so.

02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:24.500
But then a third book is called the Assayer.

02:39:24.500 --> 02:39:26.420
So what is an assayer?

02:39:26.420 --> 02:39:29.060
So assayers were kind of like these alchemists,

02:39:29.060 --> 02:39:33.020
physicists, chemists that would be around a court.

02:39:33.020 --> 02:39:35.340
And every so often for the treasurer,

02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.900
they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens

02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:40.780
and convert that to script or paper money.

02:39:40.780 --> 02:39:43.420
And to do that, they needed someone to verify

02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:46.140
with a standard of gold that they knew to be gold

02:39:46.140 --> 02:39:49.740
and do some kind of semi non-destructive evaluation

02:39:49.740 --> 02:39:51.820
of the purported object, the metal,

02:39:51.820 --> 02:39:53.220
that was supposed to be gold.

02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:55.540
So they would take these pieces of gold,

02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:57.100
theoretically gold, and they would rub it

02:39:57.100 --> 02:39:59.220
on something called a touchstone.

02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:01.820
Touchstone was a special piece of rock, granite, whatever.

02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:03.940
It has no intrinsic value.

02:40:03.940 --> 02:40:05.180
It's just a piece of rock.

02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:07.740
But with that rock, you could assay

02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:10.380
and determine the content of this thing

02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:13.340
that could be worth millions of lira or whatever, right?

02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:15.100
So it was an incredibly important job.

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:18.780
And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock

02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.740
and use it to do something valuable.

02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:22.780
What I wanna do in the assayer project

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.900
is take this plethora of physical theories of everything.

02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:28.620
And I said recently, you know,

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:29.980
we should give a Numball Prize to someone

02:40:29.980 --> 02:40:32.380
who doesn't come up with a theory of everything.

02:40:32.380 --> 02:40:33.820
Because there's just-

02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:34.900
That's a good-

02:40:34.900 --> 02:40:37.340
There's just like, it's just rotten with them.

02:40:37.340 --> 02:40:39.060
And I think it's great.

02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:42.980
You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software

02:40:42.980 --> 02:40:44.740
and I'm not denigrating software at all,

02:40:44.740 --> 02:40:46.540
but like you can create a lot of software.

02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:49.420
You can make a quine and it'll make its own quine.

02:40:49.420 --> 02:40:51.340
And like you can make infinite amounts of software.

02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:52.420
Look it up, kids.

02:40:52.420 --> 02:40:54.060
That's one of my favorite videos.

02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:55.220
And you can see, you can replicate.

02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:56.060
You can't replicate.

02:40:56.060 --> 02:40:57.660
You can't make a telescope that makes a telescope

02:40:57.660 --> 02:40:58.500
that makes a-

02:40:58.500 --> 02:40:59.860
In other words, hardware is kind of like

02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:02.020
the non-fungible token that's ultimate minted,

02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:03.420
you know, limited edition, the book,

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:05.340
the compass book, like I talk.

02:41:05.340 --> 02:41:07.380
And so it's very expensive.

02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:09.100
That means you have to be very careful

02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:12.820
before you invest decades, billions, and humans

02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:15.660
into pursuing one of these theories of everything.

02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:17.900
You have to have good intuition for it.

02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:21.180
And lately what I've seen is not predictions,

02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:22.860
but retrodictions.

02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:25.180
So you see that the Large Hadron Collider

02:41:25.180 --> 02:41:26.700
will come out with a measurement.

02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:28.180
And then so-and-so will say,

02:41:28.180 --> 02:41:32.060
oh, this is compatible with string theory.

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:33.660
Or G minus two of the muon.

02:41:33.660 --> 02:41:35.420
It has these bizarre properties.

02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:37.700
Fifth force, string theory predicts this.

02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:40.860
String theory solves this.

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:43.540
Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos,

02:41:43.540 --> 02:41:47.260
Large Hadron Collider Bottom, or B experiment.

02:41:47.260 --> 02:41:48.100
Blah, blah, blah.

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:50.020
They'll say that it's compatible after the fact.

02:41:50.020 --> 02:41:51.300
And it's not so bad, right?

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:53.140
Because look, what did Einstein do with GR,

02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:54.900
general relativity?

02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:58.100
The first thing he did was not predict something new.

02:41:58.100 --> 02:42:01.340
He looked at the anomalous behavior of the planet Mercury.

02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:03.420
And he saw it was behaving strangely.

02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:05.060
And people had said, oh, that's because

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:07.180
there's another planet hiding behind the sun

02:42:07.180 --> 02:42:09.140
that we can't see that perturbs the orbit

02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:09.980
of the planet Mercury.

02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:12.020
And it's always called Vulcan.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:13.020
That was one approach.

02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:14.780
That's kind of like the dark matter approach

02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:16.540
where it's like there's a clump of matter

02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:19.060
that we can't see that's influencing the planet

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.140
that we can't see.

02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:23.060
And we use that to divine and intuit the existence

02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:23.900
of the other planet.

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:25.460
That's actually how Neptune was discovered.

02:42:25.460 --> 02:42:27.540
Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous behavior

02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:29.140
of the planet Uranus.

02:42:29.140 --> 02:42:30.140
So Neptune was dark.

02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:30.980
We couldn't see it.

02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:33.020
It was tugging on Uranus in a certain way.

02:42:33.020 --> 02:42:36.020
And that led to Le Verrier discovering the planet,

02:42:36.020 --> 02:42:38.220
predicting where this planet should be found.

02:42:38.220 --> 02:42:40.500
So it had a good heritage in physics, right?

02:42:40.500 --> 02:42:43.140
To predict this planet that you couldn't see that worked.

02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:46.180
But Einstein said, no, it's caused by the warping

02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:49.620
and bending of spacetime due to the presence of matter

02:42:49.620 --> 02:42:51.580
will later become known as the Einstein equations.

02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:54.300
So he explained why Mercury did that.

02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:55.900
And it was known since the time of Newton

02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:58.620
that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way.

02:42:58.620 --> 02:42:59.540
So he didn't predict it.

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:00.540
He retrodicted it.

02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:01.460
That's fine.

02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:03.980
But at some point, you should come up with something new

02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:07.220
that's uniquely predictive of your theory, as I just said.

02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:09.860
The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune

02:43:09.860 --> 02:43:10.980
is actually a valid theory.

02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:14.500
It just happens not to make sense in the context of Vulcan.

02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:16.940
And so if he had kept doing that,

02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:19.900
maybe perhaps he wouldn't have come up

02:43:19.900 --> 02:43:22.580
with these other predictions that he would later reject.

02:43:22.580 --> 02:43:24.940
He rejected the existence of gravitational waves.

02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:26.580
You and Barry talked about that.

02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:27.420
He didn't actually believe it.

02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:29.820
It was the one peer-reviewed paper that he had.

02:43:29.820 --> 02:43:31.300
He used to send back in those days,

02:43:31.300 --> 02:43:33.540
he'd send a letter to Nature, physical review,

02:43:33.540 --> 02:43:36.820
publish this, let me know how much it costs.

02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:38.300
And they got it rejected because he said,

02:43:38.300 --> 02:43:40.220
you can't detect gravitational waves.

02:43:40.220 --> 02:43:41.860
And actually, or they're not real.

02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:42.980
And the guy showed that they're real

02:43:42.980 --> 02:43:44.980
because he corrected a math error

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:47.180
in Einstein and Rosen's paper.

02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:50.100
So it's fascinating, what should the assayer do?

02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:52.420
He or she should look at these theories,

02:43:52.420 --> 02:43:54.620
look what things they explain that already exist,

02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:58.860
and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain

02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:01.900
if we can build experiments to test them.

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:03.140
So you have to kind of challenge yourself

02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:06.100
to think about what kind of predictions

02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:09.460
can they make such that we can construct experiments?

02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:14.380
So that's like ultimately back going to the signal,

02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:18.660
to the experimenter's theorist, essentially.

02:44:18.660 --> 02:44:19.500
That's right.

02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:24.100
So like very experiment-centric exploration

02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:25.940
of the fundamental theory of everything.

02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:26.780
That's right.

02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:29.020
And the best scientists, the best physicists

02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:31.820
were both experimentalists and theorists.

02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:34.340
Or at least that they, if they were experimentalists,

02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:36.180
they understood the theory well enough

02:44:36.180 --> 02:44:38.580
to make predictions or to explore the predictions

02:44:38.580 --> 02:44:40.900
and the consequences of those predictions.

02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:43.220
Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo.

02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:46.020
Like Einstein has patents for things that he invented.

02:44:47.100 --> 02:44:50.260
And then some of his work led to the laser and the maser.

02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:52.940
So he had practically, it wasn't just pure airy-fairy,

02:44:52.940 --> 02:44:55.300
quantum reality and expanding universe.

02:44:56.220 --> 02:44:58.540
So in this case, what I wanna do is look at,

02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:00.100
there's 10 different theories of everything

02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:01.580
or cosmological models.

02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:02.420
They make predictions,

02:45:02.420 --> 02:45:04.140
they have advantages and disadvantages.

02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:05.620
And I'm just asking the question,

02:45:05.620 --> 02:45:07.860
why aren't we applying Bayesian reasoning

02:45:07.860 --> 02:45:09.020
with confidence intervals?

02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:10.060
Why don't we have updates?

02:45:10.060 --> 02:45:11.980
Every time an experiment comes out,

02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:14.220
we can update our credulity in that experiment

02:45:14.220 --> 02:45:15.340
or that theory rather,

02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:17.220
based on the results of the experiment.

02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:18.940
And we shouldn't do it after the fact.

02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:20.900
Or as you know, Michio Kaku has said,

02:45:20.900 --> 02:45:23.980
well, you have to tell me what the initial conditions are.

02:45:23.980 --> 02:45:24.860
And that's not my job.

02:45:24.860 --> 02:45:26.780
You're supposed to tell me if string theory is correct,

02:45:26.780 --> 02:45:29.460
what should it predict if it's true?

02:45:29.460 --> 02:45:31.660
There's one big problem, which I should say

02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:34.380
that to be a good ass air,

02:45:34.380 --> 02:45:39.380
I think you have to be worldly in the sense of,

02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:41.340
worldly and curious,

02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:44.060
like we were talking about before with you and Joe.

02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:47.500
And you can't only talk your own book.

02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:52.300
You can't only understand your own pet theory of everything.

02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.900
You can't only say, well, I only understand string theory

02:45:55.900 --> 02:45:58.460
and I don't have time for these other theories,

02:45:58.460 --> 02:46:02.780
or as if it's beneath me to even go into Garrett Lisey

02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:05.260
or Eric Weinstein or Steven Wolfram

02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:08.060
or aspects of M theory, et cetera, et cetera.

02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:09.860
And there are some that say,

02:46:09.860 --> 02:46:14.860
why do we give string theory so much of an advanced pass

02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:18.340
when there are actually predictions it's made

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:21.620
that are completely anathema to what we observe in physics.

02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:23.740
Like the dark energy should be negative

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:25.060
and we see it as positive.

02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:26.500
Like that's a huge strike.

02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:28.940
If you told somebody, here's my tenure application

02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:30.340
and what do you, oh, I've made this prediction.

02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:33.860
If it wasn't done by, you know, Maldacena and Witten

02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:34.780
and folks like that,

02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:36.940
I don't know if it would have had the traction,

02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:38.940
the endurance, the resiliency that it's had.

02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:42.780
And that worries me because all these men and some women

02:46:42.780 --> 02:46:46.140
are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas

02:46:46.140 --> 02:46:48.540
and they're not even looking at what their neighbor's doing.

02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:51.980
There's a thing that I really enjoyed seeing

02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:54.580
and that don't see often enough with these theories,

02:46:54.580 --> 02:46:58.220
which is others who are also experts

02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:01.780
kind of studying them sufficiently well

02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:04.100
to steel man the theory,

02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:06.580
to show the beautiful aspects of the theory.

02:47:07.580 --> 02:47:09.900
You know, I see that with Stephen Wolfram.

02:47:09.900 --> 02:47:14.900
He has a very different sort of formulation of physics

02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:17.180
with this physics project.

02:47:17.180 --> 02:47:21.420
Now I'm, it's, you know, physics is a foreign land to me,

02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:23.620
but his formulation,

02:47:23.620 --> 02:47:27.060
especially in the context of cellular automata or hypergraphs,

02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:28.380
just as objects,

02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:30.740
as mathematical objects themselves are familiar.

02:47:30.740 --> 02:47:33.500
And so I'm able to see the real beauty there

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:38.500
and it saddens me that others in the physics community

02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:41.180
can't also see the beauty.

02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:44.340
Like give it a chance, give a chance to see the beauty.

02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:45.180
And that-

02:47:45.180 --> 02:47:46.020
Give it your respect.

02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:48.700
So there is one person who does take time

02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:51.780
and is what I consider to be a great scientist

02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:53.180
in terms of what he thinks.

02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:55.820
He obviously has invested interest in his own theory

02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.100
and it's Eric.

02:47:57.100 --> 02:48:00.540
Eric's got a truly encyclopedic knowledge

02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:02.260
of the history of physics.

02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:06.260
And he has a great warmth and graciousness

02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:08.140
when it comes to giving others.

02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:09.900
And I've witnessed this and I've had,

02:48:09.900 --> 02:48:11.900
look, first of all, I think debate is pointless.

02:48:11.900 --> 02:48:12.860
Like, I don't know about you,

02:48:12.860 --> 02:48:14.420
but if you've ever voted like,

02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:15.940
oh, I saw this debate and you know,

02:48:15.940 --> 02:48:18.420
because Trump did so badly, now I'm gonna vote for Biden.

02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:19.340
No, never have.

02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:21.340
You almost never change anybody's mind

02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:23.100
unless you debate with love,

02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:26.740
unless you have almost like we're gonna win together,

02:48:26.740 --> 02:48:28.860
like the red team approach in the military,

02:48:28.860 --> 02:48:30.340
they're trying to win a war.

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:33.340
So they may disagree on the tactics day to day,

02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:35.140
but the strategy, we have to win this war.

02:48:35.140 --> 02:48:37.620
I love you and I wanna protect you.

02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:39.740
I don't see that in very many of these physicists

02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:40.580
from Kaku.

02:48:40.580 --> 02:48:42.780
I almost see it, it's embarrassing in some ways

02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:45.860
because they'll almost mock with the exception of Eric.

02:48:45.860 --> 02:48:48.220
You know, Garrett's interesting, you know, his theory is,

02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:51.620
you know, people have a lot of issues, very technical,

02:48:51.620 --> 02:48:54.660
but Eric has taken the time to try to understand it.

02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:57.380
Eric has taken the time to understand Peter White's theory.

02:48:57.380 --> 02:49:01.060
And I don't see the same graciousness extended from them,

02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:01.900
I'm sorry to say.

02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:03.220
Yeah, essentially, you're right, you're right.

02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:05.940
I mean, with Eric, he hasn't, he wants to,

02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:08.020
but he hasn't extended the same for Steven Wolfram

02:49:08.020 --> 02:49:09.900
because I think-

02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:11.420
No, he did, no, actually, no, he did.

02:49:11.420 --> 02:49:13.540
I had a debate with them live on my show.

02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:14.700
No, I did, I listened to it,

02:49:14.700 --> 02:49:17.580
but like, I just think it's outside of the toolkit

02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:19.180
that Eric is comfortable with.

02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:21.100
So it's not that he's not,

02:49:21.740 --> 02:49:24.340
the main thing that's often absent,

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:28.420
and Eric does have is like the willingness

02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:30.740
and like not just like dismissing or mocking

02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:32.340
the other he's reaching out.

02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:33.180
But, okay.

02:49:33.180 --> 02:49:35.020
I mean, what if it's not, you know,

02:49:35.020 --> 02:49:36.540
I made a joke when they were on, I was like,

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:38.340
how many theories of everything can there be?

02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:40.740
You know, Highlander, yeah, there can be only one,

02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:42.180
you know, I don't know, maybe.

02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:44.540
But he, of course, also, like the other folks

02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:48.580
who propose a theory has an ego.

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:49.820
Yeah.

02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:52.780
He rides a dragon,

02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:55.460
with the dragon representing the ego.

02:49:55.460 --> 02:49:59.180
Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.

02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:03.540
So he proposed initial sketches of geometric unity,

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:05.180
which is his theory of everything.

02:50:05.180 --> 02:50:07.820
Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it

02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:09.420
that you find interesting, but

02:50:12.060 --> 02:50:15.380
what do you think about the response he got

02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:17.700
from the scientific community?

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:20.980
Well, you know, some of the response came from people,

02:50:20.980 --> 02:50:24.620
academicians, professors, some came from a lay audience

02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:27.540
and some came from trained scientists who are no longer,

02:50:27.540 --> 02:50:30.540
you know, maybe practicing in the universities.

02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.380
I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol,

02:50:33.380 --> 02:50:38.180
which surprised me because I look at what he's trying to do

02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:41.540
and it was always, the vitriol would always come

02:50:41.540 --> 02:50:43.140
with some element of ad hominem

02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:45.860
and maybe that's his personality,

02:50:45.860 --> 02:50:48.180
maybe that engenders this or whatever,

02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:50.820
maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency.

02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:52.100
You know, I always get these emails,

02:50:52.100 --> 02:50:55.940
Professor Keating, I have a new theory, Einstein was wrong,

02:50:55.940 --> 02:50:57.980
I'm gonna prove it, I'm not good at math,

02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:01.660
but if you help me, I will share my Nobel Prize with you.

02:51:01.660 --> 02:51:04.580
Oh, thanks, have you read my books, you know?

02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:07.460
In other words, it's always taking down the dragon,

02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:09.860
it's always taking down the Kung Fu master, right?

02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:11.580
That you get the hit points from D&D,

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.060
you get their hit points, you take their cards,

02:51:13.060 --> 02:51:15.460
you get their risk tokens from Kamchaka

02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:18.300
and thinking about with Eric, it's like,

02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:21.180
because what he's doing is so aspirational,

02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:22.940
it is grandiose in a good sense.

02:51:22.940 --> 02:51:26.300
What he's trying to do is construct a geometric theory

02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:28.740
of everything that has aspects of supersymmetry

02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:30.220
and stuff embedded in it.

02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:34.380
He's trying to meld that, it has very unusual features

02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:37.220
and that it features not only multiple spatial dimensions,

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:38.780
multiple time dimensions,

02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:42.060
it uses new mathematical objects that he's invented

02:51:42.900 --> 02:51:46.660
and look, I had him on my show, I've talked with him,

02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.340
we've had consultations with other physicists

02:51:49.340 --> 02:51:51.860
where he'll come down and I have a visitor's office

02:51:51.860 --> 02:51:53.500
and he comes down to San Diego sometimes

02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:54.860
and spends time there

02:51:54.860 --> 02:51:58.460
and we talk with eminent mathematicians and physicists.

02:51:58.460 --> 02:52:02.620
Eric's been out of the academic world for a long time

02:52:02.620 --> 02:52:04.420
and there is, as I said before,

02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:07.460
an aspect of persuasion that must take place

02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:08.860
in order to get anything through

02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:12.780
and I think there was a slight amount of good nature,

02:52:12.780 --> 02:52:15.700
not ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that

02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:18.260
if this is right, everyone will recognize it.

02:52:18.260 --> 02:52:19.740
If you build a better mousetrap,

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:21.620
the world will beat a path to your door

02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:22.700
as the expression goes.

02:52:22.700 --> 02:52:24.380
That's completely untrue.

02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:25.740
That doesn't even happen with mousetraps.

02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:27.700
I mean, you know how many freaking mousetrap types there are?

02:52:27.700 --> 02:52:30.020
It's like, no, they don't beat a path to your door.

02:52:30.020 --> 02:52:31.820
You have to sell that freaking thing.

02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:34.900
You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or Elon.

02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:37.620
I have never, I've had one paper out of 200 papers

02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:39.420
I've published in peer-reviewed journals.

02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:42.100
I've only had one, half a percent published

02:52:42.100 --> 02:52:43.860
with no referees comments.

02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:46.220
In other words, published like dream, submitted it,

02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:47.700
it happened to be in a prestigious journal.

02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:49.460
Thought I was pretty psyched about that.

02:52:49.460 --> 02:52:51.260
But you almost have to crave the response,

02:52:51.260 --> 02:52:52.540
getting it back from a journal.

02:52:52.540 --> 02:52:54.220
And I think he doesn't see, first of all,

02:52:54.220 --> 02:52:56.380
he doesn't subscribe to the peer review process.

02:52:56.380 --> 02:52:59.060
He thinks that is anathema to the way science is,

02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:01.580
it invests interest in public, in journals,

02:53:01.580 --> 02:53:03.340
et cetera, et cetera.

02:53:03.340 --> 02:53:06.340
I think you can have elements of peer review

02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:08.820
that are substantive and valuable.

02:53:08.820 --> 02:53:10.820
I think you have to learn from your critics.

02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:12.780
One of my conversations with John Mather,

02:53:12.780 --> 02:53:15.740
he talks about loving your critics in this book,

02:53:15.740 --> 02:53:17.820
but not being so open to their criticism

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:19.980
that their criticism goes to your heart

02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:22.580
and not being so open to their compliments

02:53:22.580 --> 02:53:24.740
that their compliments go to your head.

02:53:24.740 --> 02:53:27.620
It's a very tough Scylla and Charybdis to walk.

02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:30.740
Well, there's something, I mean, I want to be careful here

02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:35.620
because I'd like to talk to Eric about this directly,

02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:39.540
but I'll just, from a perspective of a friend,

02:53:41.220 --> 02:53:44.220
want to ask about the drug of fame.

02:53:48.500 --> 02:53:51.500
So there's also the public perception

02:53:54.740 --> 02:53:56.580
of the battles of physics.

02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:58.740
And so there's a very narrow community,

02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:01.900
but then there's the way that's perceived.

02:54:02.900 --> 02:54:06.140
The exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:10.700
And so there is a certain drug to the excitement

02:54:10.700 --> 02:54:13.900
that the public can show when they sense

02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:15.500
that you have something big.

02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:21.100
And that in itself might become the thing

02:54:21.100 --> 02:54:23.580
that gives you pleasure.

02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:27.780
And I think that with theories of everything

02:54:27.780 --> 02:54:30.540
or with any kind of super, super ambitious projects,

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:34.660
and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious

02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:37.820
about trying to understand the origins of the universe,

02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:41.420
if you convince yourself that you have an intuition

02:54:41.420 --> 02:54:43.820
about the origins of the universe

02:54:43.820 --> 02:54:47.460
and you have a platform like you do now

02:54:47.460 --> 02:54:50.900
where you start to communicate your intuition,

02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:54.500
it's hazy, like all the science, you're still unsure,

02:54:54.500 --> 02:54:56.940
but you have a sense, I mean, perhaps you don't have that

02:54:56.940 --> 02:54:58.540
as much as an experimentalist

02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:00.420
because you always kind of start going,

02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:05.420
okay, how do I build a device to see through the fog?

02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:08.380
But if you're more like a theoretician

02:55:08.380 --> 02:55:11.180
who kind of works in the realm of ideas,

02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:13.580
in the realm of intuitions,

02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:16.860
it is also a source of pleasure.

02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:20.260
You mentioned dopamine, a source of dopamine

02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:22.700
that you can communicate to others

02:55:23.540 --> 02:55:25.980
that you're really excited by the possibility

02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:29.700
of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.

02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:32.340
So there's some aspect to which you want to be

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:36.900
a Grigori Grisha Perlman and go into the hole

02:55:36.900 --> 02:55:40.700
and get the work done and shut the hell up about the,

02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:42.020
I'm speaking about myself,

02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:46.860
about talking about the dream and planning and exploring

02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:51.700
how great it will be if my intuition turns out to be correct.

02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:54.820
If the sketches I have turn out

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:56.540
to actually build the bridge

02:55:56.540 --> 02:56:01.140
that takes us to a whole new place as a friend of Eric's

02:56:01.140 --> 02:56:05.460
or a friend of my friend,

02:56:05.460 --> 02:56:08.700
what kind of advice do you give?

02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:10.060
What is your role?

02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:14.300
Is it to be a supporter given that he has many critics

02:56:14.300 --> 02:56:18.980
or is it to be in private a critic?

02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:20.340
Like a lot of my friends will say,

02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:22.980
hey, shut the hell up, just get it done.

02:56:22.980 --> 02:56:24.660
Well, first of all, I want to ask you a question

02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:29.660
I've asked him and then it comes from Animal Farm by George.

02:56:29.660 --> 02:56:31.500
Probably my favorite book, yeah.

02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.020
So you remember Benjamin the donkey?

02:56:33.020 --> 02:56:33.860
Yes.

02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:35.180
And he's talking to the pig.

02:56:35.180 --> 02:56:37.260
I forget the pig's name, you probably know.

02:56:37.260 --> 02:56:38.100
Anyway, the pig says to him,

02:56:38.100 --> 02:56:41.340
you've got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail.

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:43.700
You're so lucky, I got this short, curly,

02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:46.460
little squiggly thing that does jack squat.

02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:49.500
Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous tail?

02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:52.100
And Benjamin says, well, the good Lord,

02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:56.300
he gave me a tail to swat away the flies.

02:56:56.300 --> 02:56:57.460
But you know what?

02:56:57.460 --> 02:57:01.500
I'd rather not have the tail if I didn't have the flies.

02:57:01.500 --> 02:57:05.220
So I ask you, as I've asked Eric, is it worth it?

02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:09.980
You've got these beautiful tail, but there are flies.

02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:11.300
I'm not saying in a negative way,

02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:15.900
I'm just saying you get unwanted distractions, dopamine,

02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:18.940
it's kind of the highlight, the spotlight effect.

02:57:18.940 --> 02:57:21.040
It's obviously allowing you to do things

02:57:21.040 --> 02:57:22.480
that you could never do alone.

02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:24.920
And I think, first of all,

02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:26.160
I'd love to know how you answer that,

02:57:26.160 --> 02:57:28.000
because that's something I don't feel

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:29.400
I can relate to myself.

02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:33.600
Well, this has to do with more like...

02:57:33.600 --> 02:57:35.480
Platform. Platform stuff.

02:57:35.480 --> 02:57:36.880
Yeah, scale.

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:41.880
Oh, that has very little effect on me.

02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:46.640
I enjoy meeting new people,

02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:48.440
but that has nothing to do with platform.

02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:50.280
Yeah, no, that has no effect on me.

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:57.000
I want somebody that enjoys the act itself.

02:57:57.080 --> 02:57:58.360
So this conversation,

02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:01.160
the reason I'm doing this podcast with you today

02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:03.800
is because that allows me to trick you

02:58:03.800 --> 02:58:05.680
into talking to me for a prolonged period of time.

02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:07.040
I don't care about platform.

02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:08.400
I assume nobody listens.

02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:09.920
It really doesn't matter.

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:11.120
Yeah, and I forgot to write.

02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:13.480
My whole test, it was a good podcast.

02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:14.440
How do you know?

02:58:14.440 --> 02:58:16.000
Podcast has been around, what, 12 years?

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.440
How do we know, as podcasters, we're doing a good job?

02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:19.280
Sometimes you get someone to say,

02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:20.440
that was the best interview I ever had,

02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:22.600
but that doesn't happen that often, at least for me.

02:58:22.600 --> 02:58:26.600
But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card

02:58:26.600 --> 02:58:29.360
in that little guy and the Zoom didn't work,

02:58:29.360 --> 02:58:30.440
would you do it again?

02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:32.200
And I think if you say yes to that,

02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:33.080
that was a good podcast.

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:35.040
Yeah, exactly, that's exactly it.

02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:40.040
So in that space, yeah, all of it is worth it.

02:58:42.080 --> 02:58:46.360
But the dream, I'm more referring

02:58:46.360 --> 02:58:47.920
to the psychological effects.

02:58:47.960 --> 02:58:49.960
Forget the platform, forget all of that.

02:58:50.960 --> 02:58:52.680
Maybe you shouldn't even brought up the platform

02:58:52.680 --> 02:58:55.960
because it really has to do, even in your own private mind,

02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:57.600
which is what I'm struggling with,

02:58:59.120 --> 02:59:04.120
I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages,

02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:11.720
so much that I often don't take projects to completion.

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:14.120
This is a psychological effect

02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:15.760
that I'm sure basically everybody,

02:59:15.760 --> 02:59:18.800
every engineer, everybody that does anything goes through.

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:22.800
I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies,

02:59:22.800 --> 02:59:25.480
and I wonder as a friend, what is the role?

02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:27.520
So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented,

02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:30.240
everything from planning telescopes to dieting.

02:59:30.240 --> 02:59:34.000
So there's a tiny bit of dopamine that you get

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:36.000
visualizing how you're gonna feel,

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:38.000
you don't need to know this, but you don't deal with it,

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.320
but losing five pounds.

02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:40.920
I say, oh, I'm gonna lose five pounds,

02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:43.320
and I'm gonna be able to run a minute faster.

02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:45.400
So there's a part of me when I'm planning the diet

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:47.040
and the meals and the exercise

02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:49.160
that I get a little bit of that thrill,

02:59:49.160 --> 02:59:51.240
and that actually saps a little bit of my willpower

02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:53.440
to actually complete the task that will take me to that goal.

02:59:53.440 --> 02:59:54.600
So that's a documented effect,

02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:57.840
and that happens in project planning and project management.

02:59:57.840 --> 03:00:00.520
It's a very, very important thing to guard against

03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:02.600
as a manager of a big project.

03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:05.680
With Eric, it's interesting because with him,

03:00:05.680 --> 03:00:08.760
first of all, we relate extremely well

03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:11.800
on a friendship level and very close.

03:00:11.800 --> 03:00:14.200
He does remind me a lot of my father,

03:00:14.240 --> 03:00:17.320
and I've told him that just as a mathematician,

03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:21.600
as a big thinker, in his case as a father,

03:00:21.600 --> 03:00:24.480
the father kind of figure that I didn't have in a sense,

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:27.200
but that he is a true lover of life.

03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:28.840
He knows he's got a huge platform.

03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:31.520
He knows he gets a lot of attention for what he does,

03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:34.880
and I jokingly say, well, it's one thing.

03:00:34.880 --> 03:00:37.040
How do you know, Lex, that someone's an expert?

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:39.040
So experts say.

03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:41.400
There's a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in principles.

03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:42.480
He says, an expert is someone

03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:45.200
who's done something three times successfully.

03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:47.160
You can do something correctly once.

03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:48.440
You could do something correctly.

03:00:48.440 --> 03:00:51.160
It's very hard to pull off three projects,

03:00:51.160 --> 03:00:53.880
three telescopes, three whatever, right?

03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:56.280
So look for, it's arbitrary.

03:00:56.280 --> 03:00:58.440
It could be four, it could be two, right?

03:00:58.440 --> 03:00:59.720
But the point is, look at Eric.

03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:01.480
So how many things has he contributed to

03:01:01.480 --> 03:01:05.800
and made pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts

03:01:05.800 --> 03:01:06.760
for different people?

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:09.120
I would say he's been right many times.

03:01:09.120 --> 03:01:11.360
Does that mean he's infallible, that he's ineffable?

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:12.720
No, of course not.

03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:15.160
For me, so what I'm saying is I get a little bit

03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:19.120
of the joy of kind of learning something purely

03:01:19.120 --> 03:01:21.640
as a scientist, something completely outside

03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:25.240
of what I do, mathematics, gauge theory,

03:01:25.240 --> 03:01:30.240
the kind of very advanced geometry topology

03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:31.800
that he's interested in.

03:01:31.800 --> 03:01:35.640
But every now and then I will sneak in that I want,

03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:36.880
I've told him that I'm gonna turn your son

03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:39.160
into an experimentalist despite you.

03:01:39.160 --> 03:01:40.280
He is not gonna be a theorist.

03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:41.280
Zev is not gonna be a theorist.

03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:43.440
He is working with me, he is learning from me.

03:01:43.440 --> 03:01:46.280
We're trying to get him into, he wants to bypass

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:48.680
all of the kind of nonsense of undergraduate

03:01:48.680 --> 03:01:50.120
and go straight to graduate school.

03:01:50.120 --> 03:01:52.600
And I've tried to encourage him that maybe he could do it,

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:55.160
maybe he can't, but there's no other way than to try.

03:01:55.160 --> 03:01:57.680
And so I've prepared a whole curriculum for Zev

03:01:57.680 --> 03:01:59.640
to basically bypass all of undergraduate.

03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:02.040
And to his credit, he earns all the credit.

03:02:02.040 --> 03:02:04.040
He's learned it to a level that matches

03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:05.120
many of my graduate students.

03:02:05.120 --> 03:02:06.040
Okay, hold on a second.

03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:08.520
I have to push back and this is me saying it

03:02:08.520 --> 03:02:11.640
and I'm sure I'll talk to Eric about this.

03:02:11.640 --> 03:02:15.760
But to say, you said Eric's done,

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:19.280
was right on multiple things.

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:24.280
I think Eric has a great deep insight

03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:27.680
about human nature and how societies work.

03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:31.520
And he says a lot of wise words on that world.

03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:34.780
But I think if we're talking about experts,

03:02:34.780 --> 03:02:36.240
you kind of have to prove, you know,

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:38.560
it's like Michael Jordan playing baseball.

03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:42.160
Like he's proved it many times that he can play basketball,

03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:44.520
but he's also got to prove that he can play baseball.

03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:47.520
And I would say the whole point of, I mean,

03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:51.460
of radical ideas is you're not,

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:54.840
I mean, it's very hard to be sitting on a track record

03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:57.760
of, I mean, when you're swinging for the fences always,

03:02:57.760 --> 03:03:00.880
you're, there's not a track record to sit on.

03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:05.280
And like Max Tegmark is an example of somebody

03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:09.360
who has a huge track record of more like acceptable stuff,

03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:11.560
but he also keeps swinging for the fences

03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:13.000
in every other world.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.840
So he has that track record.

03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:17.720
With Eric, if you look at just the number of publications,

03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:19.040
all this stuff, he did really,

03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:21.520
he chose not to travel the academic route.

03:03:21.520 --> 03:03:24.640
So there's no proof of expertise

03:03:24.640 --> 03:03:29.640
except sort of an obvious linguistic demonstration

03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:32.920
of brilliance, but that's not how physics works, right?

03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:35.320
There's a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist

03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:37.040
and say, he or she,

03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:40.120
they really know the history of physics very well.

03:03:40.120 --> 03:03:41.240
Like, this is always lovely.

03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:43.320
Like Sean Carroll always jokes about like,

03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:46.480
physicists should never talk about history of physics,

03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:47.600
but it's more than that.

03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.520
So Eric has certainly contributed in finance

03:03:51.520 --> 03:03:55.160
and finance specifically and gauge theory and economics

03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:59.040
and inflation dynamics and the non-cosmological.

03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:00.960
Hold on a second, that's yet to be proven.

03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:03.480
He has a lot of powerful interest.

03:04:03.480 --> 03:04:04.960
Calculative is calculus proven.

03:04:04.960 --> 03:04:08.640
I mean, he has a gauge model for currency,

03:04:08.640 --> 03:04:12.360
for currency exchanges between different nations

03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:13.520
that is explanatory.

03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:16.920
Not, it's not, you know, is this something?

03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:18.360
In other words, it's a model

03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:20.120
and it's used for pedagogical purposes.

03:04:20.120 --> 03:04:21.840
And it might be, okay.

03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:22.680
It's unique to him.

03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:24.000
I mean, to him and Pia.

03:04:24.000 --> 03:04:27.520
Yes, it might be a powerful model.

03:04:27.520 --> 03:04:29.600
It might be one that's actually deserves

03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:32.400
a huge amount of applause and celebration,

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.160
but does not yet receive that.

03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:35.960
And that's one of the things that Eric talks about.

03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:38.000
It has not received the attention it deserves,

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.960
but it has not yet received the attention it deserves.

03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:43.720
And so like the proven expertise thing,

03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:47.160
I mean, there's a lot of people that go to their grave

03:04:47.160 --> 03:04:48.920
without the recognition they deserve.

03:04:48.920 --> 03:04:50.440
And it's a tragedy.

03:04:50.440 --> 03:04:53.480
But the fact is, like,

03:04:53.480 --> 03:04:55.720
you have to fight for that recognition.

03:04:55.720 --> 03:04:57.320
The tragedy happens for a reason.

03:04:57.320 --> 03:05:00.720
You can't just say this person is obviously brilliant

03:05:00.720 --> 03:05:03.400
and therefore they deserve the credit

03:05:05.240 --> 03:05:06.920
in every single domain.

03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:09.440
It doesn't like transfer immediately.

03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:12.040
There's nobody that's, well, at least I wouldn't argue,

03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:15.560
Eric is one of the special minds in our generation.

03:05:15.560 --> 03:05:18.760
But you still have to fight the fight of physics

03:05:18.760 --> 03:05:20.440
and prove it within the community.

03:05:20.440 --> 03:05:22.760
And I think the same applies in economics.

03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:27.280
You can't, I mean, as somebody that, you know,

03:05:28.160 --> 03:05:30.800
I've gone through the academic journey,

03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:33.360
just like you said, the peer review,

03:05:33.360 --> 03:05:35.880
all of those things, flawed as they are,

03:05:35.880 --> 03:05:37.640
that's the part of the process.

03:05:37.640 --> 03:05:39.400
You have to convince your peers,

03:05:39.400 --> 03:05:44.160
the people that are as obsessed for whatever the hell reason

03:05:44.160 --> 03:05:46.720
about that particular thing that you're working on.

03:05:46.720 --> 03:05:48.040
Yes, there's egos.

03:05:48.040 --> 03:05:49.280
Yes, there's politics.

03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:50.920
It's a giant mess.

03:05:50.920 --> 03:05:52.880
But I think it's a beautiful mess

03:05:52.880 --> 03:05:56.200
through which you have to go through

03:05:56.200 --> 03:06:00.560
in order to reveal the power of your idea

03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:02.520
to yourself and to the world.

03:06:02.520 --> 03:06:03.400
Well, let me use an example.

03:06:03.400 --> 03:06:06.040
So you know of James Clerk Maxwell

03:06:06.040 --> 03:06:08.560
and he invented the laws of electromagnetism,

03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:10.840
which is the first example of a unification principle

03:06:10.840 --> 03:06:13.520
ever displayed by the human mind in history.

03:06:13.520 --> 03:06:15.280
Purely mathematics,

03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:17.960
unifying completely disparate phenomena.

03:06:17.960 --> 03:06:21.200
In one case, electricity, charges, static electricity,

03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:23.480
lightning, and the other magnets, bar magnets,

03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:25.240
currents, et cetera, unified them.

03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:27.080
You know what he did?

03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:28.720
I like to do a thought experiment.

03:06:28.720 --> 03:06:31.000
Imagine Twitter exists, 1864.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.400
Maxwell's working away.

03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:34.880
And he goes, I have this wonderful idea with fluxions

03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:37.720
and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah.

03:06:37.720 --> 03:06:39.920
And it revolves on this thing called an ether.

03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:42.760
And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears,

03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:44.480
and the gears have these planetary things

03:06:44.480 --> 03:06:45.440
and they suck up vortices,

03:06:45.440 --> 03:06:46.960
and the vortices determine the density

03:06:46.960 --> 03:06:49.000
of the electromagnetic potential.

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.120
You'd be like, this guy's a fricking nut, moron.

03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:52.480
And what would you do?

03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:53.800
Come on, honestly, you would say

03:06:53.800 --> 03:06:55.560
everything this guy does is wrong.

03:06:55.560 --> 03:06:57.280
I mean, he's got this idiotic idea,

03:06:57.280 --> 03:07:00.080
and it would be falsified a couple of decades later

03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:02.040
by Michelson and Morley.

03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:04.520
And in so doing, you would have thrown out

03:07:04.520 --> 03:07:07.400
a very beautiful baby with bathwater.

03:07:07.400 --> 03:07:09.720
Imagine Twitter, imagine the twit storm

03:07:09.720 --> 03:07:13.640
Clerk Maxwell, at Clerk Maxwell one would get.

03:07:13.640 --> 03:07:14.960
It would be brutal, right?

03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:17.600
And to the detriment, and that might even set back history.

03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:19.360
Imagine Yang Mills doing the same thing.

03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:22.200
Charm Simon's, a lot of these things are very fantastic.

03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:23.240
But why Lex?

03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:26.640
Why does Ed Witten, why does Juan Maldacena,

03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:28.880
let me give a good example, Juan Gast,

03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:30.720
brilliant guy, I love him.

03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:33.520
He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded

03:07:33.520 --> 03:07:36.360
his black hole information paradox loss issue.

03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:37.200
What did he concede?

03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:40.280
Conceded based upon Maldacena's calculation

03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:43.800
in ADS, CFT, and five dimensional wormholes.

03:07:44.920 --> 03:07:46.040
Is any of that, first of all,

03:07:46.040 --> 03:07:47.440
we don't live in an ADS universe.

03:07:47.440 --> 03:07:49.960
Second of all, we don't know if wormholes are traversable,

03:07:49.960 --> 03:07:51.840
if they exist even.

03:07:51.840 --> 03:07:55.440
These are devices, Kip Thorne is popularized for movies.

03:07:55.440 --> 03:07:58.320
To say that this is something on which I will concede a bet.

03:07:58.320 --> 03:08:00.840
Now, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.

03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:04.480
Why does Maldacena, and he's got a pretty high H index,

03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:06.560
pretty well-respected guy at IAS,

03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:08.240
love talking to him, brilliant guy.

03:08:08.240 --> 03:08:11.900
By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia's

03:08:11.900 --> 03:08:14.320
work on gauge theory and economics.

03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:16.520
Originally, and one, I believe the breakthrough,

03:08:16.520 --> 03:08:17.640
I can't remember exactly what,

03:08:17.640 --> 03:08:20.600
but partially credit some of the work that he did,

03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:24.000
which appears there's a footnote to Pia Milani's thesis

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.360
and some conversations with Eric, I think, in it.

03:08:26.360 --> 03:08:28.320
Anyway, getting back to that,

03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:30.280
why is there not the same skepticism?

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:33.120
Is it because Maldacena, who's an eminent physicist,

03:08:33.120 --> 03:08:37.360
obviously, has published realistic work and done,

03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:39.000
what about Whitten?

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:40.040
Whitten gets a pass.

03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:40.880
I mean, if you-

03:08:40.880 --> 03:08:42.880
Well, Whitten gets a pass on which aspect?

03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:43.720
The string theory?

03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:45.200
Well, yeah, that M theory is correct.

03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:46.560
I mean, here's, let me just say Hawking.

03:08:46.560 --> 03:08:48.400
Hawking gets the ultimate pass.

03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:50.880
Hawking would say things like M theory.

03:08:50.880 --> 03:08:52.180
There's zero evidence for it.

03:08:52.180 --> 03:08:54.480
I mean, there's the famous meme that went around this weekend

03:08:54.480 --> 03:08:56.760
like, what does string theory predicted and it's nothing.

03:08:56.760 --> 03:08:57.920
And by the way, that's actually wrong.

03:08:57.920 --> 03:08:59.840
I talked to Comron, I know you talked to Comron.

03:08:59.840 --> 03:09:02.280
Comron says that string theory does make predictions.

03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:03.840
It predicts the mass of the electron lies

03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:06.040
between 10 to the minus one Planck mass

03:09:06.040 --> 03:09:07.680
and 10 to the minus 30 Planck mass.

03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:09.680
Oh, okay, whatever, our electron mass.

03:09:09.680 --> 03:09:10.520
It's a big range.

03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:11.360
It's a huge range.

03:09:12.240 --> 03:09:15.640
Imagine Comron comes up, and again, he's just some nobody,

03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:17.200
but he actually, you know, he doesn't have a profile.

03:09:17.200 --> 03:09:18.480
He's not at Harvard.

03:09:18.480 --> 03:09:21.320
That's zero H and X or whatever Eric says.

03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:23.000
Why do we not like, in other words,

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.840
why are we more harsh on people that are trying?

03:09:25.840 --> 03:09:27.600
You know the answer to that.

03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:31.640
So I get a million emails just like you said yourself

03:09:31.640 --> 03:09:34.240
where they provenized in my world

03:09:34.240 --> 03:09:36.040
is artificial intelligence.

03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:38.960
The equivalence of that is I figured out

03:09:38.960 --> 03:09:42.520
how to build consciousness, how to engineer intelligence,

03:09:42.520 --> 03:09:44.440
how to, and sometimes-

03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:45.840
You should send your emails to me

03:09:45.840 --> 03:09:46.680
and I'll send my emails to you.

03:09:46.760 --> 03:09:48.640
And we'll reply to, I mean,

03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:50.400
and I don't want to sort of mock this

03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:52.400
because I think it's very possible

03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:55.600
that there is either kernels of interesting ideas

03:09:55.600 --> 03:09:58.880
or in whole, like there is geniuses out there

03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:03.040
that are unheard, but because of so much noise,

03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:08.040
you do have to weigh, like hire the Ed Wittons of the world

03:10:10.520 --> 03:10:12.120
when they make statements.

03:10:12.120 --> 03:10:14.840
And that's why you build up a track record,

03:10:14.840 --> 03:10:16.880
like you just said with Ray Dalio,

03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:20.280
you have to show that you can,

03:10:21.400 --> 03:10:24.440
like if you're a Pollock and you show us a painting

03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:27.000
of a bunch of chaos, you have to,

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:28.520
and this is a bad example probably

03:10:28.520 --> 03:10:29.920
because he probably never showed this proof.

03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:30.760
I don't think he could do it.

03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:35.760
Yeah, it's much more comforting

03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:39.840
to see that they can paint a good, accurate picture.

03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:40.680
Still life.

03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:43.480
Of still life, of an apple on the table.

03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:45.160
Meteorite at a time.

03:10:45.160 --> 03:10:46.280
Because then, I mean,

03:10:47.960 --> 03:10:50.000
because then there's something

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:51.360
about the scientific community

03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:54.840
that they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor

03:10:54.840 --> 03:10:57.200
to where they're not going to give the full effort

03:10:57.200 --> 03:11:00.200
of their attention if you don't have the track record.

03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:03.400
Now you could say that's a kind of club that only,

03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:04.960
you have to like, you have to have 10,

03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:07.000
you have to have this, yes, that exists,

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:10.440
but there's some aspect in which you have to play the game

03:11:10.440 --> 03:11:13.840
a little bit to get the machine of science going.

03:11:13.840 --> 03:11:16.560
Otherwise, if you're always saying,

03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:20.200
well, I have my ball and I don't wanna play your game,

03:11:20.200 --> 03:11:23.480
your game sucks, then nobody's gonna wanna play with you.

03:11:23.480 --> 03:11:24.720
That's true.

03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.080
Look, inherent in all of this is an underlying grandiosity.

03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:31.480
Look, how could you talk about doing what Kaku said

03:11:31.480 --> 03:11:33.520
on here and elsewhere?

03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:34.960
We're looking for the umbilical cord

03:11:34.960 --> 03:11:36.840
that connects our universe to another universe

03:11:36.840 --> 03:11:38.840
that will then reveal in a one inch equation

03:11:38.840 --> 03:11:41.440
that will surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God.

03:11:41.440 --> 03:11:42.960
That's like a prerequisite, I guess,

03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:44.160
to tackle these questions.

03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:46.960
I think it's detrimental.

03:11:46.960 --> 03:11:48.840
I think doing that, first of all,

03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:50.760
I think there's an element of almost snarkiness

03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:53.320
because none of these scientists are believing, you know,

03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:55.720
Gnostics, they're not theists, right?

03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:57.640
So they're using it as kind of a stand-in

03:11:57.640 --> 03:11:59.120
and they always talk about Einstein didn't,

03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:02.080
he was like a Spinoza and he wasn't a, you know, a theist.

03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:03.080
God doesn't play dice.

03:12:03.080 --> 03:12:03.920
God doesn't play dice.

03:12:03.920 --> 03:12:05.200
Yeah, Einstein's mentions of God, yeah.

03:12:05.200 --> 03:12:08.320
Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says if when we come,

03:12:08.360 --> 03:12:11.600
we get an M theory understood, we'll know the mind of God.

03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.840
That's the title of Kaku's book,

03:12:13.840 --> 03:12:16.440
The God Particle, The God Equation.

03:12:16.440 --> 03:12:19.280
It, you know, do any of them really believe in God?

03:12:19.280 --> 03:12:20.360
No, is that a prerequisite?

03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:21.480
No, I'm not saying that.

03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:23.440
But the point being,

03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:25.160
you're talking about something that has to do with God, right?

03:12:25.160 --> 03:12:26.600
I mean, where else do you go from there?

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:29.560
I mean, I think God for now enjoys a little bit more,

03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:33.200
you know, kind of a PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right?

03:12:33.200 --> 03:12:37.320
So like, you know, God's got a pretty good H index himself.

03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:39.160
He has, by the way, a Twitter account,

03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:40.440
just so you know, it's pretty good.

03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:41.280
The tweets of God.

03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:43.320
Yeah, the tweets of God.

03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:46.040
So if you look at that, you have to go in there.

03:12:46.040 --> 03:12:47.720
Again, you have to go in with some swagger.

03:12:47.720 --> 03:12:50.360
You have to have a little bit of arrogance,

03:12:50.360 --> 03:12:52.800
but you should, I agree, mix with a little bit of humility.

03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:55.960
So he's doing something, he comes from outside of academia.

03:12:55.960 --> 03:12:58.240
Now, if he rails against, I'm talking about Eric now,

03:12:58.240 --> 03:12:59.680
if he's just railing, oh, the system,

03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:01.200
and I'm not going to publish because F that,

03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:03.440
and that's only created by greedy journals,

03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:05.640
I don't think he's doing himself any favors.

03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:07.240
On the other hand, if he's shopping it,

03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:13.160
if he's willing to expose it to criticism

03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:15.000
and to even embrace people

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:18.120
who may not have the purest intentions perhaps,

03:13:18.120 --> 03:13:21.480
but in the sense of like they're not arguing solely

03:13:21.480 --> 03:13:23.920
to get to the truth with a capital T.

03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:25.680
What they're trying to do is take down Eric.

03:13:25.680 --> 03:13:27.720
Hopefully those people aren't out there.

03:13:27.720 --> 03:13:29.400
But on the other hand,

03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:32.280
looking at what Eric does for other people,

03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:34.600
looking at the fact that he has courtesy.

03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:35.840
He will look at Wolfram.

03:13:35.880 --> 03:13:38.040
He will look at Lisi, who's one of his closest friends.

03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:40.320
I mean, he calls him as his aunt, not his aunt.

03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:41.160
Nemesis.

03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:42.000
Nemesis, right, right.

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:43.160
And I think that's interesting

03:13:43.160 --> 03:13:44.320
that they're loving friends.

03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:46.240
I really enjoyed that portal conversation

03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:49.880
between Gary Lisi, Eric is torn about that conversation

03:13:49.880 --> 03:13:53.400
because I guess, because of the nemesis

03:13:53.400 --> 03:13:56.120
of the beautiful dance of minds playing with these ideas

03:13:56.120 --> 03:13:56.960
and theories of everything.

03:13:56.960 --> 03:13:59.160
And some of these things, so fundamentally,

03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:02.120
now I may disagree with him, Eric, on a different aspect,

03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:03.480
which is the only one I'm capable of,

03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:05.360
but let me say one thing, which is experimental,

03:14:05.760 --> 03:14:06.720
but let me say one thing.

03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:08.800
I understand probably a third

03:14:08.800 --> 03:14:10.640
of what Eric's talking about with GU.

03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:13.880
I understand GR, I understand mathematics,

03:14:13.880 --> 03:14:16.440
I understand some group theory, fiber bone.

03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:19.120
I can get a little of it, the age theory,

03:14:19.120 --> 03:14:21.960
but I also understand what I don't understand.

03:14:21.960 --> 03:14:23.280
And I understand that there are people

03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:26.680
like Witton, Maldisena, Nima, other people

03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:28.200
that can understand it,

03:14:28.200 --> 03:14:29.840
and they're not trying to understand it.

03:14:29.840 --> 03:14:31.080
Sabina, she can understand it.

03:14:31.080 --> 03:14:33.360
She makes all these, oh, I don't understand it,

03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:35.200
I don't wanna understand it, I don't have time.

03:14:36.040 --> 03:14:37.720
And then she makes a video, a music video,

03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:40.280
kind of mocking Eric and Steven and Garrett.

03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:42.360
I'm like, oh, you have a time to do, and I love Sabina,

03:14:42.360 --> 03:14:44.440
and I've actually promoted my show on her,

03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:47.120
and I love her, and she's doing a wonderful job.

03:14:47.120 --> 03:14:49.840
But you have a video that you said yourself

03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:51.480
takes eight weeks to produce from start to finish,

03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:54.560
and you couldn't have spent 30 minutes, two hours,

03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.880
I, Brian Keating, have done it

03:14:55.880 --> 03:14:57.800
as an experimental cosmologist.

03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:00.240
And I have enough to say, this is interesting,

03:15:00.240 --> 03:15:01.960
it's part of the Assair project,

03:15:01.960 --> 03:15:04.000
and actually, I shouldn't say that there are no people,

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:07.280
there are very few, Louis Alvarez-Gomay

03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:10.120
at SUNY Stony Brook Simon Center for Geometrical Physics.

03:15:10.120 --> 03:15:12.280
So he and I are running this seminar,

03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:13.960
hopefully this summer, we're gonna reenact

03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:17.520
the famous Shelter Island conferences in 1900s,

03:15:17.520 --> 03:15:19.200
where Feynman got together,

03:15:19.200 --> 03:15:21.040
and they calculated the Lamb shift and all that.

03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:24.080
But what did that feature, the harmony,

03:15:24.080 --> 03:15:27.360
the resonant minds behind the best experimentalists

03:15:27.360 --> 03:15:30.560
in cosmology, particle physics, condensed matter physics

03:15:30.560 --> 03:15:31.960
is now teaching us tremendous things

03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:34.840
about lower dimensional systems that can be applied.

03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:37.000
Theorists and experimentalists,

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:40.640
observers, cosmologists, we all get together,

03:15:40.640 --> 03:15:43.360
and we're just gonna do it out of a spirit of love.

03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:46.080
But if it's just like, oh, this guy's like a loud mouth,

03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:47.640
I don't have time for that, I really don't.

03:15:47.640 --> 03:15:50.360
I don't think it's an interesting way to spend my time.

03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:53.000
There is an aspect that I hope to see,

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:58.000
and it goes back to our discussion about Joe Rogan.

03:15:58.040 --> 03:16:01.400
I do hope to see love and humility in the presentation.

03:16:01.440 --> 03:16:06.080
Let go of this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen

03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:09.680
and the ego that's inherent to the scientific pursuit.

03:16:12.160 --> 03:16:16.160
Now that everybody is established and known entities,

03:16:16.160 --> 03:16:17.400
let go of that a little bit,

03:16:17.400 --> 03:16:20.200
so we can explore and celebrate ideas.

03:16:20.200 --> 03:16:21.400
I would love to see more of that,

03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:22.640
just like as you're saying,

03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:25.760
especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.

03:16:26.600 --> 03:16:28.600
I mean, this isn't talking tales out of school,

03:16:28.600 --> 03:16:30.120
but I mean, he has made claims

03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:32.080
that I fundamentally disagree with,

03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:35.880
in terms of like, he's had this Twitter baiting,

03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:37.440
loving trolling of Elon,

03:16:37.440 --> 03:16:39.320
why are you spending all this money to get to Mars?

03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:41.160
We should be spending money on interdimensional travel,

03:16:41.160 --> 03:16:42.760
and we can unlock it.

03:16:42.760 --> 03:16:44.880
And I said to him, and he makes the point

03:16:44.880 --> 03:16:49.560
that all the atomic theory that unleashed the nuclear age,

03:16:49.560 --> 03:16:52.720
and that could lead to planetary destruction.

03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:56.160
But I make the point pushing back with love on him,

03:16:56.160 --> 03:16:58.960
and I say, look, nobody looked into the equations,

03:16:58.960 --> 03:17:01.320
Fermi didn't look into all these equations

03:17:01.320 --> 03:17:04.040
of the unification, which still doesn't exist, by the way.

03:17:04.040 --> 03:17:05.360
We spent all this time, Lex,

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:06.400
and I don't know why it is,

03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:08.560
it's a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics.

03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:10.960
People are looking for the toe,

03:17:10.960 --> 03:17:12.960
and they're overlooking the gut.

03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:13.800
In other words, they're spending all this time

03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:16.080
on the theory of everything, the God and the equator,

03:17:16.080 --> 03:17:17.640
and there's this gut that unifies

03:17:17.640 --> 03:17:18.760
the three stronger forces.

03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:20.320
We don't have a single theory for that.

03:17:20.320 --> 03:17:23.000
And people like Glashow, they've tried and failed at it.

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:23.960
Yeah, for people who don't know,

03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:25.600
there's four forces,

03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:29.040
grant unification theories that unifies the three forces

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:30.880
stuff, and trying to get a shortcut

03:17:30.880 --> 03:17:33.480
to the theory of everything, which unifies the four.

03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:35.800
And then there's this whole thing

03:17:35.800 --> 03:17:38.200
that may be quantum gravity is not even a thing.

03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:43.200
So we're trying to solve the puzzle of everything

03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:49.000
at the physics level.

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.560
And then already before solving it,

03:17:51.560 --> 03:17:53.240
already saying, once we solve it,

03:17:53.240 --> 03:17:55.080
here's going to be all the beautiful-

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:59.120
We're just level-jumping it, going to level 256.

03:17:59.120 --> 03:18:00.880
Time-axing thing.

03:18:00.880 --> 03:18:02.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:18:02.920 --> 03:18:06.760
I suppose you need that kind of ego, that confidence,

03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:09.360
that ambition in order to even have a chance

03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:10.200
at some of these things.

03:18:10.200 --> 03:18:13.160
The only two people in this book of nine Nobel laureates

03:18:13.160 --> 03:18:16.160
who told me they don't have the imposter syndrome

03:18:16.160 --> 03:18:19.520
were two theorists, Frank Wilchuk and Sheldon Glashow.

03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:21.080
And Frank is a pretty interesting,

03:18:21.080 --> 03:18:22.200
and I know eventually we're gonna talk

03:18:22.200 --> 03:18:23.040
about the meaning of life,

03:18:23.400 --> 03:18:25.280
you talk about Frank.

03:18:25.280 --> 03:18:27.720
Frank invented this theory along with his advisor

03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:32.000
and another third person in the early 1970s,

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.640
which from 1974 or three, when he was at Princeton,

03:18:34.640 --> 03:18:37.000
all the way up until 2004, when he won the Nobel Prize,

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:38.640
every day of his life.

03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:40.600
Imagine this, Lex, you're gonna have this startup,

03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:43.240
someone tells you you're gonna win the lottery.

03:18:43.240 --> 03:18:45.160
You're gonna win the lottery in 40 years.

03:18:45.160 --> 03:18:48.040
What becomes your singular focus in your life

03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:49.840
from now until the next 40 years?

03:18:50.840 --> 03:18:52.960
Well, I'm not sure.

03:18:52.960 --> 03:18:55.160
I mean, would it be winning the lottery?

03:18:55.160 --> 03:18:56.000
Or if I'm so confident.

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:57.560
You're guaranteed to win a lottery?

03:18:57.560 --> 03:18:58.400
Yeah.

03:18:58.400 --> 03:18:59.560
Here's this wallet, Bitcoin wallet,

03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:01.000
it's gonna guarantee you don't have as much money,

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:02.760
it's a stable coin, whatever.

03:19:02.760 --> 03:19:05.200
You're gonna win it, but you have to wait 40 years.

03:19:05.200 --> 03:19:07.880
To me, it would be surviving for the next 40 years.

03:19:07.880 --> 03:19:09.240
You wouldn't leave your house.

03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:11.280
You would cover, go out in a bubble wrap hat.

03:19:11.280 --> 03:19:13.320
You wouldn't go out with that 20 masks on, right?

03:19:13.320 --> 03:19:15.840
Your whole life would be consumed with.

03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:17.120
Now imagine, everyone's telling you

03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:17.960
you're gonna win the Nobel Prize,

03:19:18.160 --> 03:19:19.160
which is bigger than the lottery.

03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:20.760
I mean, many people prizes are worth more

03:19:20.760 --> 03:19:21.600
than the Nobel Prize,

03:19:21.600 --> 03:19:23.320
and every person who wins a prize

03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:25.560
that's worth three times the money, like Maldacena,

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:27.560
he would trade that breakthrough prize

03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:29.120
for a Nobel Prize in a heartbeat.

03:19:29.120 --> 03:19:32.160
So these guys had to wait 40 years.

03:19:32.160 --> 03:19:33.760
Imagine the excruciating pain.

03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:34.880
What got him through it?

03:19:34.880 --> 03:19:36.880
He didn't feel like he didn't deserve it.

03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:38.960
He felt like, hell yeah, I earned it.

03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:40.760
He has that swagger.

03:19:40.760 --> 03:19:42.680
And what I'm looking for in this asset

03:19:42.680 --> 03:19:45.880
is to try to find ways that we can test stuff now,

03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:47.520
ways that we can test stuff now,

03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:49.280
because I don't know if I'm gonna be here in 40 years.

03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:51.160
I hope I am, but can we bypass?

03:19:51.160 --> 03:19:52.000
Can we get shortcuts?

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:53.600
What's called the low energy regime?

03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:55.840
And to me, that's what's interesting.

03:19:55.840 --> 03:19:56.680
What can we do now?

03:19:56.680 --> 03:19:57.520
I don't care.

03:19:57.520 --> 03:19:59.640
Isaac Newton came up with color theory,

03:19:59.640 --> 03:20:00.640
and he did something really interesting.

03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:02.240
Next time I come, I'll bring you some prisms.

03:20:02.240 --> 03:20:03.080
What did he do?

03:20:03.080 --> 03:20:04.000
He took a white light.

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.000
He took a prism from the sun, actually.

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:07.600
He put it through a slit, put it through a prism,

03:20:07.600 --> 03:20:10.480
and it made a beautiful rainbow, like you've seen.

03:20:10.480 --> 03:20:12.280
And then he took another prism,

03:20:12.280 --> 03:20:13.720
and he put it upside down,

03:20:13.720 --> 03:20:15.480
like dark side of the moon or whatever,

03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:17.280
and the light went through the first prism,

03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:18.120
turned into a rainbow,

03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:20.040
and then the rainbow went into a prism

03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:21.560
and came out a white light.

03:20:21.560 --> 03:20:22.800
That's pretty cool.

03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:24.840
Then he took a popsicle stick or whatever,

03:20:24.840 --> 03:20:26.440
it's probably a pipe tobacco,

03:20:26.440 --> 03:20:29.760
and he put it in the beam, like blocked out the orange,

03:20:29.760 --> 03:20:31.800
and it didn't make white light come out.

03:20:31.800 --> 03:20:34.160
So he showed colors of synthesis.

03:20:34.160 --> 03:20:35.000
It's a combination.

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:38.360
He didn't use the Large Hadron Collider to do that.

03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:40.240
He used a very low energy experiment

03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:42.520
to prove a unification in this color physics

03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:43.760
and different kind of color physics

03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:45.440
than in quantum chromodynamics.

03:20:46.400 --> 03:20:48.520
But nevertheless, can we find things like that?

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:50.520
Are we spending way too much time and energy

03:20:50.520 --> 03:20:53.040
thinking about the future circular collider,

03:20:53.040 --> 03:20:53.880
which even if it gets built,

03:20:53.880 --> 03:20:56.120
will cost $30 billion just to build?

03:20:56.120 --> 03:20:58.800
By the way, from now on, if I leave you with anything,

03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:00.880
anytime an experimental physicist tells you a number,

03:21:00.880 --> 03:21:02.760
always double it, maybe triple it.

03:21:02.760 --> 03:21:03.920
How much is it gonna cost?

03:21:03.920 --> 03:21:05.000
To operate it.

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.080
So do we build an aircraft carrier,

03:21:07.080 --> 03:21:08.480
to build an aircraft carrier?

03:21:08.480 --> 03:21:11.200
Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor facility?

03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:12.760
And the rule of thumb that works pretty well

03:21:12.760 --> 03:21:15.400
in project management is it costs about 10% per year

03:21:16.360 --> 03:21:19.480
to create a given object of sufficient complexity.

03:21:19.480 --> 03:21:21.120
And in this case, so in 10 years,

03:21:21.120 --> 03:21:22.160
it'll cost double the cost.

03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:23.840
So never believe a number,

03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:26.240
whether it's from our mutual friend Harry or whoever,

03:21:26.240 --> 03:21:27.600
don't believe the number, double it,

03:21:27.600 --> 03:21:28.920
and then say, is it worth it?

03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:31.920
And so building a solar system size accelerator,

03:21:31.920 --> 03:21:34.200
even if it were possible, do we have to do that?

03:21:34.200 --> 03:21:37.240
Or can we use these two 30 solar mass objects

03:21:37.240 --> 03:21:40.080
colliding together to test the number

03:21:40.080 --> 03:21:41.760
of large extra spatial dimensions?

03:21:41.760 --> 03:21:42.600
Can we do that?

03:21:42.600 --> 03:21:43.440
People are working on it.

03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:44.600
I think it's fascinating.

03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:46.160
Building detectors.

03:21:46.160 --> 03:21:47.000
Experiments.

03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:53.280
That, like, where the cosmos is part of the experiment,

03:21:55.560 --> 03:21:57.360
I suppose, that's doing the hard work.

03:21:57.360 --> 03:22:00.280
Because when you're saying low energy regime,

03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:02.640
because for some of these, especially big questions

03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:03.840
like theories of everything,

03:22:03.840 --> 03:22:07.400
you need some high energy events.

03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:10.320
And so somehow figure out how the high energy events

03:22:10.320 --> 03:22:12.720
that are already happening out there,

03:22:12.880 --> 03:22:16.160
how to leverage them here on earth.

03:22:16.160 --> 03:22:19.160
So one of the alternative theories of cosmology

03:22:19.160 --> 03:22:22.120
that is not singular quantum gravitational requiring

03:22:22.120 --> 03:22:23.960
as the Big Bang and inflation are,

03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:26.120
are these bouncing models.

03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:29.120
Some of them feature a similar kind of entity

03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:30.680
called a quantum field.

03:22:30.680 --> 03:22:33.400
And that quantum field in the initial stages

03:22:33.400 --> 03:22:35.480
of the universe of our current after the bounce,

03:22:35.480 --> 03:22:36.720
which is not a singularity,

03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:39.360
it compresses to a classical kind of rebound,

03:22:39.360 --> 03:22:41.560
and the universe starts expanding.

03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:43.400
During that process,

03:22:43.400 --> 03:22:46.440
the expansion is governed by what's called a scalar field,

03:22:46.440 --> 03:22:48.280
of which we only know one that exists,

03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:49.280
that's called the Higgs boson.

03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:52.680
Higgs is a scalar fundamental particle, fundamental field.

03:22:53.520 --> 03:22:56.360
That field then later does double duty

03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:59.560
and it becomes dark energy.

03:22:59.560 --> 03:23:01.000
So it solves two problems.

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:02.720
And I'm not saying it's correct, we don't know yet.

03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:04.640
But are there observations of,

03:23:04.640 --> 03:23:06.320
and so dark energy is manifest today.

03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:10.240
It's manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions,

03:23:10.240 --> 03:23:11.200
et cetera, et cetera.

03:23:11.200 --> 03:23:13.240
We see the effects of accelerating universe

03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:15.080
caused by presumably dark energy.

03:23:15.080 --> 03:23:18.240
Is dark energy a constant or does it vary?

03:23:18.240 --> 03:23:20.760
That has to vary in order for this theory to be true,

03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:22.360
because that eventually has to decay

03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:24.360
so that the universe can not support itself

03:23:24.360 --> 03:23:26.680
and collapse again, again, classically.

03:23:26.680 --> 03:23:28.600
So we could use low energy phenomenon.

03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:29.800
It's hard to think of supernova

03:23:29.800 --> 03:23:31.440
as being a low energy phenomenon,

03:23:31.440 --> 03:23:34.160
but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field

03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:36.560
and see, does it change or is it a constant?

03:23:36.560 --> 03:23:38.120
That's an example of a low energy limit

03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:40.200
to prove a high energy phenomenon

03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:43.040
like this collapsing universe in the cyclic model.

03:23:43.040 --> 03:23:46.480
Speaking of things that cost a lot but are super exciting.

03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:47.320
Yeah.

03:23:49.160 --> 03:23:51.360
Page two, crap.

03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:52.920
No, we'll wrap it up.

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:53.760
No.

03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:54.600
Calm down.

03:23:54.600 --> 03:23:56.560
There's more than page two.

03:23:56.560 --> 03:23:58.560
What do you think this is?

03:23:58.560 --> 03:23:59.400
This is-

03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:00.240
This is my thesis.

03:24:00.240 --> 03:24:03.120
Well, Louis de Broglie's thesis was three pages long

03:24:03.120 --> 03:24:06.080
and he won the Nobel Prize for the wave particle duality.

03:24:06.080 --> 03:24:10.760
So size matters in different dimensions in life.

03:24:10.760 --> 03:24:13.520
I think the lessons I've learned about life

03:24:13.520 --> 03:24:16.920
is the short of the paper or the short of the thesis.

03:24:17.920 --> 03:24:18.960
Actually, the short of the paper,

03:24:18.960 --> 03:24:21.720
some of the greatest papers ever written are short.

03:24:21.720 --> 03:24:26.040
I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,

03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:28.720
not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman,

03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:30.440
a contradiction on top of a contradiction,

03:24:30.440 --> 03:24:32.720
but it could be written on a napkin, honestly.

03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:37.120
It just kind of tells you something about ideas.

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:44.440
What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope?

03:24:45.480 --> 03:24:49.880
Is this, as somebody who likes telescopes,

03:24:49.880 --> 03:24:52.640
and this is one of the, I think it says,

03:24:53.800 --> 03:24:57.640
it took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion.

03:24:57.640 --> 03:24:59.240
Is that way too much, too little?

03:24:59.240 --> 03:25:01.240
Are you excited about this thing?

03:25:01.280 --> 03:25:04.160
It's sufficiently different from what I do in my field

03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:05.960
that it's incredibly interesting to me

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:09.560
because I have no horse in that race.

03:25:09.560 --> 03:25:12.320
And so I'm not competing with them for time or money

03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:14.360
or resources or people or whatever.

03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:18.960
So I can purely be an advocate and an aficionado of science.

03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:21.840
It is, in some sense, the successor to Hubble.

03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:24.640
It will do things that Hubble can't do.

03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:27.640
It will also may or may not have the impact

03:25:27.680 --> 03:25:31.520
on a visceral kind of artistic level that Hubble had.

03:25:31.520 --> 03:25:34.280
What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?

03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:37.800
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the pillars of creation,

03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:41.440
storms and imaging of these twisted deep galaxy,

03:25:41.440 --> 03:25:43.000
deep sky galaxies.

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000
Those resonated with the public.

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000
Just visually, they were beautiful.

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
Yeah, when you look at these images,

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.600
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, you'll maybe put that in,

03:25:51.600 --> 03:25:54.040
you'll show every speck of light except for one,

03:25:54.040 --> 03:25:56.000
4,000 blobs of light.

03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:59.000
There's one star in our galaxy, the rest are galaxies.

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:02.240
Now that image is less than one-tenth of your fingernail

03:26:02.240 --> 03:26:03.840
held out at arm's length.

03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:05.800
It contains 4,000 galaxies.

03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:08.520
So now you can figure out how many galaxies there are

03:26:08.520 --> 03:26:11.360
in the whole sky just by seeing how long does it take you

03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:13.160
to move your fingernail over the whole sky.

03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.400
So we have another couple of hours.

03:26:15.400 --> 03:26:16.320
No, so it comes out to be,

03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:18.920
that's how we get 500 billion or more galaxies.

03:26:18.920 --> 03:26:20.360
Now it's not exact to the galaxy,

03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:22.880
but it's a good order of magnitude estimate,

03:26:22.880 --> 03:26:24.520
maybe even better.

03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:25.520
Hubble produced that.

03:26:25.520 --> 03:26:26.920
And it was basically serendipitous.

03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:29.160
They pointed some dark blank piece of sky

03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:30.800
what they thought was blank and they saw it.

03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:32.560
Same thing that happened with the CMB.

03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:34.480
They were looking for something they didn't find.

03:26:34.480 --> 03:26:35.880
Same thing they found when they were looking

03:26:35.880 --> 03:26:38.280
for the deceleration of the universe

03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:40.280
and found it was accelerating.

03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:43.080
So what I sometimes hear is that we don't know

03:26:43.080 --> 03:26:44.400
what we're gonna discover.

03:26:44.400 --> 03:26:46.000
I never think that's a good idea

03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:47.720
to spend billions of dollars on something.

03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:51.120
Like you should have some guaranteed low-hanging fruit

03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:53.360
and then there should be swinging for the fences.

03:26:53.360 --> 03:26:54.720
And I think in this case,

03:26:55.240 --> 03:26:56.520
everything is swinging for the fences

03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:58.520
because it's kind of a single point failure.

03:26:58.520 --> 03:27:01.840
If that telescope, which is this origami construction

03:27:01.840 --> 03:27:05.440
of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly

03:27:05.440 --> 03:27:08.200
and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth

03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:11.000
beyond the Earth-Moon distance by a factor of four

03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:15.280
and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth,

03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:17.680
get solar energy, keep it away from the sun.

03:27:17.680 --> 03:27:19.640
You don't wanna look through the telescope of the sun

03:27:19.640 --> 03:27:20.920
with your remaining good eye.

03:27:20.920 --> 03:27:24.040
And you do that and you cover, it's gonna be phenomenal.

03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.880
For science, for sure, if it works.

03:27:27.880 --> 03:27:30.520
There are a lot of people think it's so risky.

03:27:30.520 --> 03:27:33.520
NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up.

03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:34.600
And what if it does fail?

03:27:34.600 --> 03:27:35.880
I mean, there's no guarantee.

03:27:35.880 --> 03:27:37.640
Yes, it's insured, but so what?

03:27:37.640 --> 03:27:39.920
You're not gonna get back those 20 years of people,

03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:41.120
well, let's start building it again.

03:27:41.120 --> 03:27:43.360
Like they didn't build two copies of it.

03:27:43.360 --> 03:27:48.360
And then if it fails, it kind of has a dampening effect

03:27:49.160 --> 03:27:51.920
on the prospects and the inspiration of the public

03:27:51.960 --> 03:27:53.200
for what science can do,

03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:55.960
what science engineering can do is out in space.

03:27:55.960 --> 03:27:57.640
It will make a huge impact scientifically.

03:27:57.640 --> 03:27:58.480
It's a hope for the best.

03:27:58.480 --> 03:28:00.040
Let's assume it does succeed.

03:28:00.040 --> 03:28:01.600
It's launched in a couple of weeks.

03:28:01.600 --> 03:28:06.120
And when it does, it will transform our understanding of,

03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:10.000
we just discovered not only extrasolar planets

03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:12.040
that have moons on them and asteroid belt,

03:28:12.040 --> 03:28:15.040
we discovered an extrasolar planet in another galaxy.

03:28:15.040 --> 03:28:16.880
This will be able to see crazy stuff like that,

03:28:16.880 --> 03:28:21.720
spectroscopy, imaging, but it will be able to go back

03:28:21.720 --> 03:28:25.000
farther in time such that we will be doing cosmology.

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.440
Hubble did some cosmology and measured the Hubble constant.

03:28:27.440 --> 03:28:30.880
That was its key project when it was designed and launched.

03:28:30.880 --> 03:28:33.440
But because it is optical telescope,

03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:35.640
it's sensitive to more close in redshift.

03:28:35.640 --> 03:28:37.120
So it's shorter distances.

03:28:37.120 --> 03:28:39.320
Now, James Webb is much, much higher redshift.

03:28:39.320 --> 03:28:42.280
It can probe the darker, deeper, distant universe.

03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:44.440
Okay, let's talk about not the distant universe,

03:28:44.440 --> 03:28:47.080
but our neighboring planets.

03:28:47.080 --> 03:28:49.480
First, I gotta ask you about the moon.

03:28:52.400 --> 03:28:55.160
So there's a piece of the moon on this table

03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:58.680
that you've given me that we didn't have to pick up

03:28:58.680 --> 03:29:00.240
that arrived here.

03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:01.080
That's right.

03:29:01.080 --> 03:29:03.400
So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on earth?

03:29:03.400 --> 03:29:05.360
So this chunk of the moon,

03:29:05.360 --> 03:29:10.320
if it were delivered by the Apollo and NASA missions,

03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:12.840
you and I would be guilty of a felony right now

03:29:12.840 --> 03:29:14.600
because it's illegal to own pieces of the moon

03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:16.560
collected by the Apollo astronauts.

03:29:16.560 --> 03:29:19.680
So don't even joke about that when you go over to Houston.

03:29:19.680 --> 03:29:21.400
This piece of moon rock was delivered

03:29:21.400 --> 03:29:23.560
via the old fashioned way by gravity.

03:29:23.560 --> 03:29:27.640
So this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off

03:29:27.640 --> 03:29:31.840
because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids.

03:29:31.840 --> 03:29:34.800
Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon

03:29:34.800 --> 03:29:36.240
into space.

03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:41.120
And it will then orbit the common moon earth system

03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:44.040
and it will then eventually enter our atmosphere.

03:29:44.040 --> 03:29:45.600
And if the piece is large enough

03:29:45.600 --> 03:29:47.800
and the trajectory is proper, it can land intact.

03:29:47.800 --> 03:29:51.040
And this one landed with a few hundred grams worth

03:29:51.040 --> 03:29:52.480
and they sliced it up.

03:29:52.480 --> 03:29:56.360
And then it was delivered via US postal service to my house.

03:29:56.360 --> 03:29:57.520
So you can buy these pieces

03:29:57.520 --> 03:29:59.720
and actually you can buy a piece of Mars.

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:02.680
You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route.

03:30:02.680 --> 03:30:04.280
Now, what's so interesting about that?

03:30:04.280 --> 03:30:06.600
Well, if a piece of Mars can get here,

03:30:06.600 --> 03:30:08.600
a piece of earth can get there.

03:30:08.600 --> 03:30:11.440
Some piece of earth has some life forms on it,

03:30:11.440 --> 03:30:12.680
it could get there.

03:30:12.680 --> 03:30:14.520
And if that can happen in our solar system,

03:30:14.520 --> 03:30:16.480
it could happen throughout the galaxy.

03:30:16.480 --> 03:30:18.440
So I'm actually not of the opinion

03:30:18.440 --> 03:30:21.400
that there is life elsewhere in the universe,

03:30:21.400 --> 03:30:23.600
at least technological life that we can see.

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:26.040
I see this look of horror on your face.

03:30:26.040 --> 03:30:30.160
I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,

03:30:30.160 --> 03:30:31.400
would be extremely surprised.

03:30:31.400 --> 03:30:34.520
I'm just, I'm curious by the transition

03:30:34.520 --> 03:30:38.400
because you just said that life could have arrived

03:30:38.400 --> 03:30:40.680
from Mars or like from planet to planet

03:30:40.680 --> 03:30:43.480
by because of the meteorite striking and so on.

03:30:43.480 --> 03:30:45.760
And then you went to, you don't think

03:30:46.520 --> 03:30:48.760
there might be life out there in the universe.

03:30:48.760 --> 03:30:49.800
Technological life.

03:30:49.800 --> 03:30:52.160
Technological life, yeah,

03:30:52.160 --> 03:30:53.640
advanced intelligence civilizations.

03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:57.120
Okay, so go on.

03:30:57.120 --> 03:30:59.240
So that's the generalization of what

03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:01.120
the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,

03:31:01.120 --> 03:31:04.720
I know this is a PG-13, it's called panspermia.

03:31:04.720 --> 03:31:06.480
Panspermia.

03:31:06.480 --> 03:31:07.320
Beep that out, please.

03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:08.160
Yeah, yeah, please.

03:31:08.160 --> 03:31:12.520
And that's the exchange of genetic life form material

03:31:12.520 --> 03:31:14.360
from other reaches on earth,

03:31:14.360 --> 03:31:16.880
which explains the origin of life on earth,

03:31:16.880 --> 03:31:18.400
but not the origin of life itself,

03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:20.200
which I think is a much grander mystery

03:31:20.200 --> 03:31:22.120
and much more interesting.

03:31:22.120 --> 03:31:23.160
How did life get here?

03:31:23.160 --> 03:31:26.080
And you've talked with many eminent people about that.

03:31:26.080 --> 03:31:26.920
I'm not gonna add that much,

03:31:26.920 --> 03:31:29.560
but just thinking about the reverse process.

03:31:29.560 --> 03:31:32.720
Let's say life started on the earth somehow

03:31:32.720 --> 03:31:34.720
and then made its way out into the universe.

03:31:34.720 --> 03:31:37.000
Is there enough time for whatever material

03:31:37.000 --> 03:31:40.560
went from earth via panspermic direction,

03:31:40.560 --> 03:31:42.880
spraying the love gun out into the universe,

03:31:42.880 --> 03:31:45.200
did that then have enough time to incubate

03:31:45.200 --> 03:31:47.440
and go onto a planet that could support it,

03:31:47.440 --> 03:31:49.680
certainly not within our solar system,

03:31:49.680 --> 03:31:51.400
which traveling at the meteorite speeds

03:31:51.400 --> 03:31:53.880
would require hundreds of millions of years,

03:31:53.880 --> 03:31:55.720
then looking at the evolutionary history

03:31:55.720 --> 03:32:00.720
from bacteria to Bach, from rocks to Rachmaninoff,

03:32:00.720 --> 03:32:01.880
I don't know, I can do this all day.

03:32:01.880 --> 03:32:02.880
Oh, wow, that's pretty good.

03:32:02.880 --> 03:32:05.080
How do you get from those very simple

03:32:05.080 --> 03:32:06.320
inanimate objects to life?

03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:08.240
I just simply think there's not enough time for earth

03:32:08.240 --> 03:32:10.720
to seed technological life throughout the galaxy.

03:32:10.720 --> 03:32:12.560
I don't think there's any evidence for that.

03:32:13.160 --> 03:32:18.160
So you really think that the origin of life on earth

03:32:18.160 --> 03:32:20.000
is a really special event.

03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.760
Yeah, if it did originate on earth,

03:32:22.760 --> 03:32:24.840
my question for those that search for life

03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:28.480
outside the earth is what if you had a letter from God

03:32:28.480 --> 03:32:32.880
and the letter said, life didn't originate on earth.

03:32:32.880 --> 03:32:35.360
Would you choose a different profession?

03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:36.640
It would seem hopeless.

03:32:36.640 --> 03:32:38.320
In other words, we only have a sample of one.

03:32:38.320 --> 03:32:40.360
In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,

03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:42.840
not alone one planet that has life on it.

03:32:42.840 --> 03:32:45.120
What if you knew for sure it didn't start here?

03:32:45.120 --> 03:32:48.120
That means that there's almost nothing about earth

03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:52.240
that is originated, it didn't originate the life process.

03:32:52.240 --> 03:32:54.040
So to study purely the origin of life,

03:32:54.040 --> 03:32:56.000
not life itself, I think that's still fascinating,

03:32:56.000 --> 03:32:59.280
but how could we learn about the origin of,

03:32:59.280 --> 03:33:01.160
remember, you have to go from inanimate object

03:33:01.160 --> 03:33:04.320
to a living object, whatever that definition of life is,

03:33:04.320 --> 03:33:06.360
and I'm not an expert in many definitions,

03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:09.520
Max, Sarah, many different definitions.

03:33:10.320 --> 03:33:13.760
But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate?

03:33:13.760 --> 03:33:14.800
It's a huge question.

03:33:14.800 --> 03:33:17.320
Yeah, but then you don't have to be the place

03:33:17.320 --> 03:33:21.160
where life originated to replicate the origin or to,

03:33:21.160 --> 03:33:23.480
like, yeah, that's one way to understand something

03:33:23.480 --> 03:33:27.720
is to build it, but another way is to just observe it.

03:33:27.720 --> 03:33:32.000
You don't have to truly re-engineer from scratch.

03:33:32.000 --> 03:33:37.000
So, but then yes, if it didn't originate on earth,

03:33:37.200 --> 03:33:41.760
then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites

03:33:41.760 --> 03:33:43.600
of life are off.

03:33:43.600 --> 03:33:45.160
What's the governing principle?

03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:48.240
Like, what is, and then you can have just

03:33:48.240 --> 03:33:51.600
almost an arbitrary number of possible,

03:33:51.600 --> 03:33:54.480
like, if life didn't start on earth,

03:33:56.480 --> 03:33:59.040
to me, that's exciting because it's like,

03:33:59.040 --> 03:34:01.160
we know even less than we thought.

03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:04.680
The thing is, it can prosper on earth, though.

03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:06.040
Yeah.

03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:08.920
So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different

03:34:08.920 --> 03:34:11.200
from the maintenance of life.

03:34:11.200 --> 03:34:16.000
Right, and maybe the existence of the earth life symbiosis

03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:16.840
is critical.

03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:19.760
I think, Sarah, and you talked about Sarah Walker,

03:34:19.760 --> 03:34:22.080
that it's a planetary phenomenon, et cetera.

03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:24.640
So doesn't that make it less like, in other words,

03:34:24.640 --> 03:34:27.080
not only do you need special life conditions

03:34:27.080 --> 03:34:31.560
to create life, but then sustenance of life, as you say,

03:34:31.560 --> 03:34:33.840
that also has to be maintained

03:34:33.880 --> 03:34:37.040
under very specific circumstances by very specific planets

03:34:37.040 --> 03:34:39.560
and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.

03:34:39.560 --> 03:34:41.560
And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby.

03:34:41.560 --> 03:34:43.800
You need an earth and a moon system

03:34:43.800 --> 03:34:46.040
so that you don't get bombarded too early.

03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:48.800
And I always think like this, like, technological life,

03:34:48.800 --> 03:34:50.680
I haven't said this before, really, so I'm not just speaking.

03:34:50.680 --> 03:34:52.840
I usually like to write down before I say this different thing.

03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:53.920
But one of the things I thought about is-

03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:57.280
Somebody who hosts a podcast should probably accept

03:34:57.280 --> 03:34:59.320
the fact that you're going to say stupid things

03:34:59.320 --> 03:35:00.200
every once in a while.

03:35:00.200 --> 03:35:02.880
Not every once in a while, every while.

03:35:02.880 --> 03:35:07.880
I claim that to get to sending people to the moon,

03:35:08.440 --> 03:35:12.000
our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right?

03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:14.880
Like you don't make a solar panel from another solar panel.

03:35:14.880 --> 03:35:17.120
Like you made a solar panel from a factory

03:35:17.120 --> 03:35:20.200
that melted down glass, silica, aluminum,

03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:21.760
extruded that using fossil fuels.

03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:23.400
Where do those fossil fuels come from?

03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:26.440
Like, so any civilization that's going to be a Dyson,

03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:29.360
Kardashev's, do they have dinosaurs?

03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:31.320
Like, do they have like prebiotic life?

03:35:31.320 --> 03:35:32.920
Did they have a great oxygenation event?

03:35:32.920 --> 03:35:37.400
Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic, eukaryotic?

03:35:37.400 --> 03:35:39.160
All those hurdles, let's say you give each one,

03:35:39.160 --> 03:35:40.920
let's say there's eight hurdles.

03:35:40.920 --> 03:35:43.320
And each one of those has a probability of one in the thousand

03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:46.760
to go from, you know, eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever.

03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:48.120
Let's say that's a one in a thousand chance.

03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:50.480
I think it's like one in 10 to the 40th or whatever,

03:35:50.480 --> 03:35:51.320
if you really do it.

03:35:51.320 --> 03:35:53.200
But let's say it's first of generous nature,

03:35:53.200 --> 03:35:55.040
one in 10 to the three.

03:35:55.040 --> 03:35:57.080
Let's say there's eight of those hurdles.

03:35:57.080 --> 03:36:01.120
That means you have 10 to the 24th power,

03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:03.280
different possibility.

03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:04.520
And that's just with eight.

03:36:04.520 --> 03:36:05.760
Like the moon has to be there,

03:36:05.760 --> 03:36:07.880
Jupiter has to be there, dinosaurs have to be there.

03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:08.880
All the different things that we have

03:36:08.880 --> 03:36:11.040
to get to technological life.

03:36:11.040 --> 03:36:12.800
There's only 10 to the, only.

03:36:12.800 --> 03:36:15.280
There's 10 to the 22nd, we think,

03:36:15.280 --> 03:36:18.900
Earth, not Earth, planets in the observable universe,

03:36:18.900 --> 03:36:20.420
not the galaxy.

03:36:20.420 --> 03:36:24.160
So that's 100 times fewer than the probability to get,

03:36:24.160 --> 03:36:27.400
you know, 100% clearing these eight very low hurdles

03:36:27.400 --> 03:36:28.840
of one in a thousand.

03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:29.680
That's fascinating,

03:36:29.680 --> 03:36:31.960
because now I really need to listen to your conversation

03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:34.160
with Lee Cronin, who I believe you had,

03:36:34.160 --> 03:36:36.520
because he believes the opposite.

03:36:36.520 --> 03:36:37.620
Yes, I know.

03:36:37.620 --> 03:36:39.760
Yeah, I wanna have a debate with him.

03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:44.760
He believes that the way biology evolved on Earth

03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:48.920
could have evolved almost an infinite number of other ways.

03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:51.180
So like if you ran Earth over and over and over,

03:36:51.180 --> 03:36:54.320
you would keep getting life and it would be very different.

03:36:54.320 --> 03:36:58.400
So it's the fact that our particular life

03:36:58.400 --> 03:37:01.000
seems unique is just like, well,

03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:03.320
because every freaking life is gonna seem unique,

03:37:03.320 --> 03:37:05.080
but it'll be very different.

03:37:05.080 --> 03:37:07.680
It's not like we shouldn't be asking the question

03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:11.220
of what's the likelihood of getting a human-like thing,

03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:15.340
because that seems to be super special.

03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:20.340
It's more like, how easy is it to make

03:37:21.520 --> 03:37:24.000
anything that has the skills of a human,

03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:26.080
and I don't mean like something with thumbs,

03:37:26.080 --> 03:37:29.600
but achieving basically a technological civilization.

03:37:29.600 --> 03:37:33.840
And according to Lee at least, it's like, it's trivial.

03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.560
I know, we fought, I fought a little bit.

03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:37.000
I'd love to debate him and I think it'd be a lot of fun,

03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:38.020
because we debate with love.

03:37:38.020 --> 03:37:40.280
When I talk with Lee, I love him and he loves me, I think.

03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:42.440
I hope, but let me ask you a question.

03:37:42.440 --> 03:37:45.920
I asked this of him and Sarah on our clubhouse once.

03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:47.840
So what do you think would happen the next day?

03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:52.280
Let's say we discover life, it's Proxima Centauri B.

03:37:52.280 --> 03:37:54.920
It looks just like slime mold,

03:37:54.920 --> 03:37:57.800
like you got on your brie cheese or whatever.

03:37:57.800 --> 03:37:58.920
We discover it.

03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:00.520
What would happen the next day?

03:38:01.400 --> 03:38:03.960
And they were like, oh, this would be transformative.

03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:06.920
And I'm not trying to be like total Cassandra about this,

03:38:06.920 --> 03:38:09.800
but I said, I don't think anything would happen.

03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:10.640
What are you talking about?

03:38:10.640 --> 03:38:12.160
This would be transformational.

03:38:12.160 --> 03:38:14.240
I'm like, I stipulate that life exists.

03:38:14.240 --> 03:38:16.760
Go down to like the river, I'm in San Diego.

03:38:16.760 --> 03:38:19.260
Go down to the Pacific Ocean, scoop up a glass.

03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:22.700
You're gonna find life in there.

03:38:22.700 --> 03:38:23.620
And what are we doing?

03:38:23.620 --> 03:38:25.420
What are we doing to our earth?

03:38:25.420 --> 03:38:27.340
We're destroying it callously.

03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:29.060
We're like pumping crap into there.

03:38:29.060 --> 03:38:31.140
Like we have this toxic waste spill a couple of months ago

03:38:31.140 --> 03:38:33.660
in San Diego, I couldn't go to the beach.

03:38:33.660 --> 03:38:35.220
Let me take it a step further.

03:38:35.220 --> 03:38:36.700
Do you know how many people, you know how many people,

03:38:36.700 --> 03:38:38.100
I'm sorry, that you do know,

03:38:38.100 --> 03:38:41.540
but how many people died in the 20th century, killed?

03:38:41.540 --> 03:38:44.160
These are advanced civils, this is a slime mold.

03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:48.300
We kill, we maim, we harm, we hurt, we hate.

03:38:48.300 --> 03:38:50.220
I don't think anything would happen the next day.

03:38:50.220 --> 03:38:51.300
Then we go back to what we had.

03:38:51.300 --> 03:38:52.980
And I said, if that weren't proof enough,

03:38:52.980 --> 03:38:55.320
life has been discovered at least two or three times

03:38:55.320 --> 03:38:56.580
just in my professional career.

03:38:56.580 --> 03:39:01.220
Once in 1996, these Alan Landhills meteorites in Antarctica,

03:39:01.220 --> 03:39:04.440
this like microbial respiration processes.

03:39:04.440 --> 03:39:05.340
Still, we don't know.

03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:07.220
It was a press conference held by Bill Clinton

03:39:07.220 --> 03:39:10.660
on the White House lawn that's featured in the movie Contact.

03:39:10.660 --> 03:39:12.060
Repurpose for that movie.

03:39:12.900 --> 03:39:17.240
And then there's this phosphorus life,

03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:20.960
this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake.

03:39:21.040 --> 03:39:24.320
Many, you know, extremophile, we don't give a crap.

03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:25.480
We continue to treat.

03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:27.760
So why are we thinking that like our salvation,

03:39:27.760 --> 03:39:30.680
from whence will our salvation come, as the Bible says?

03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:32.640
Like, it's not gonna change how we are.

03:39:32.640 --> 03:39:36.240
It's not gonna magnify how I treat you or you treat me.

03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:38.040
And we're pretty knowledgeable people,

03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:39.840
you and I, compared to, you know, lay people.

03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:40.760
Okay, that's interesting.

03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:41.920
That's a really interesting argument.

03:39:41.920 --> 03:39:45.860
I wonder if you're right, but my intuition is,

03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:50.360
I can maybe present a different argument

03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:52.280
that you can think about in the realm

03:39:52.280 --> 03:39:54.800
of things you care about even deeper,

03:39:54.800 --> 03:39:57.180
which is like, what happens once we figure out

03:39:57.180 --> 03:39:58.840
the origins of the universe?

03:39:58.840 --> 03:40:00.000
Like, how would that change your life?

03:40:00.000 --> 03:40:03.440
I would say there are certain discoveries

03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:05.000
that even in their very idea

03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:07.280
will change the fabric of society.

03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:10.200
I tend to see if there's definitive proof

03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:12.200
that there's life in the more complex,

03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:16.760
the more powerful that idea is elsewhere,

03:40:17.160 --> 03:40:20.560
I'm not exactly sure how it will change society,

03:40:21.800 --> 03:40:24.640
because it's such a slap in the face.

03:40:24.640 --> 03:40:28.100
It's such a humbling force, or maybe not.

03:40:28.100 --> 03:40:30.180
Or maybe it's a motivator to say,

03:40:31.280 --> 03:40:33.120
yeah, I don't know which force would take over.

03:40:33.120 --> 03:40:36.200
Maybe it would be governments with military

03:40:36.200 --> 03:40:39.040
start to think like, well, how do we kill it?

03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:41.580
If there's a lot of life out there,

03:40:41.580 --> 03:40:43.120
how do we create the defenses?

03:40:43.120 --> 03:40:44.600
How do we extract it?

03:40:45.080 --> 03:40:47.920
Or mine it for benefits?

03:40:47.920 --> 03:40:50.080
I mean, I just see there's 100 million

03:40:50.080 --> 03:40:51.720
literal counterexamples of that.

03:40:51.720 --> 03:40:56.560
I mean, right now there's like 700 million kids in poverty,

03:40:56.560 --> 03:40:58.880
and how do we go about our life

03:40:58.880 --> 03:41:00.080
and just not deal with that?

03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:01.720
I mean, look, I put it aside.

03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:04.840
I eat hamburgers, and in 100 years I'll be canceled

03:41:04.840 --> 03:41:07.400
for being a carnivore or whatever.

03:41:07.400 --> 03:41:09.640
But, so obviously to get through life,

03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:10.760
you have to make certain compromise.

03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:12.720
You're not gonna think about certain things.

03:41:12.760 --> 03:41:15.800
But I just think there is a sort of wish fulfillment.

03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:17.880
Like every time there's, why are we going to Mars

03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:20.440
and digging and flying this cool ass helicopter?

03:41:20.440 --> 03:41:21.280
We're looking for water.

03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:23.720
Like, stipulate that water was there.

03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:25.040
Like, I believe there was water.

03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:26.160
I think we should investigate

03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:28.200
and see what the geology was like.

03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:29.880
But don't you think, so you're saying-

03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:31.200
I don't think you're gonna get meaning from it.

03:41:31.200 --> 03:41:32.040
That's all I'm saying.

03:41:32.040 --> 03:41:33.760
I'm not saying it's not worth doing.

03:41:33.760 --> 03:41:36.680
I'm just saying there's a wish fulfillment aspect

03:41:36.680 --> 03:41:39.880
that people will find meaning for life from science.

03:41:39.880 --> 03:41:44.240
Okay, but there's a complicated line here.

03:41:44.240 --> 03:41:47.880
What if it's this intelligent civilization

03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:51.600
living obviously probably not on Mars,

03:41:51.600 --> 03:41:55.720
but somewhere like in a neighboring galaxy that we, sorry,

03:41:55.720 --> 03:41:58.480
in a neighboring-

03:41:58.480 --> 03:41:59.320
Star system.

03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:02.360
Star system that we discover,

03:42:02.360 --> 03:42:05.440
don't you think that profound change in meaning?

03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:07.760
I mean, I guess, again, I assume that because

03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:09.920
of this pan-submarinic process or whatever,

03:42:09.920 --> 03:42:13.000
that the probability is much, much greater than zero.

03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:16.640
I mean, it's not 100%, but it's much likelier than that,

03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:19.040
that at least some living material from Earth

03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:22.120
has ejaculated itself into the solar system,

03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:23.120
into the universe, right?

03:42:23.120 --> 03:42:23.940
Into our galaxy.

03:42:23.940 --> 03:42:24.780
Beep that, please.

03:42:24.780 --> 03:42:26.280
As well.

03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:27.120
That's right.

03:42:27.120 --> 03:42:29.600
So the fact that that could happen

03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:32.320
and that you're holding a piece from a planetary body,

03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:34.640
one that couldn't support life as far as we know,

03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:37.640
but I could get next time if you play nice

03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:39.320
and you come on my podcast someday,

03:42:39.320 --> 03:42:41.000
I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars.

03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:43.640
So Mars theoretically could support stuff, right?

03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:46.560
So yeah, so I believe that there could be remnants of Earth

03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:49.040
in this, so that means there could be evolution.

03:42:49.040 --> 03:42:50.920
I don't think there's any chance that there's like,

03:42:50.920 --> 03:42:53.480
you know, people using iPhones and having podcasts

03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:54.320
and stuff and-

03:42:54.320 --> 03:42:57.360
No, there's some chance though, right?

03:42:58.720 --> 03:43:00.100
So again, it's-

03:43:00.100 --> 03:43:02.960
I think the, well, obviously the simple statement to say,

03:43:02.960 --> 03:43:04.840
it's much, much, much higher probability

03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:07.600
that life exists than technological life exists, right?

03:43:08.520 --> 03:43:09.360
I don't think we can argue that.

03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:10.400
It doesn't mean it's forbidden.

03:43:10.400 --> 03:43:12.000
Again, I'm not saying any of this is forbidden,

03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.560
not worth studying, not interesting.

03:43:13.560 --> 03:43:14.560
It's a likelihood thing.

03:43:14.560 --> 03:43:17.680
Yeah, and to answer your, I think you're wise to push back

03:43:17.680 --> 03:43:20.140
and like, what does it matter what I'm doing?

03:43:20.140 --> 03:43:21.880
And I like to think about that, you know,

03:43:21.880 --> 03:43:24.160
because it's like, what is the value of what you're doing?

03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:25.840
Like, you have to answer that question

03:43:25.840 --> 03:43:27.120
or else at the end of your life,

03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:28.560
you'll have these existential, you know,

03:43:28.560 --> 03:43:30.160
kind of crises, right?

03:43:30.160 --> 03:43:32.920
So when I think about like who I am, part of my identity

03:43:32.920 --> 03:43:35.920
is answering and asking scientific questions.

03:43:35.920 --> 03:43:38.320
For me though, there is a religious kind of undercurrent

03:43:38.320 --> 03:43:41.440
that does undergird in some sense, this quest.

03:43:41.440 --> 03:43:42.960
Again, I'm not like a practicing,

03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:44.480
I'm not like wearing yarmulke, you know,

03:43:44.480 --> 03:43:49.480
like I'm not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism,

03:43:49.640 --> 03:43:52.320
but at the same token, I think as, you know,

03:43:52.320 --> 03:43:54.000
one of the things Einstein did say is that, you know,

03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:57.640
religion without science is blind or is lame

03:43:57.640 --> 03:44:02.080
and science without religion is lame, is blind and lame.

03:44:02.080 --> 03:44:05.040
Anyway, the point is that like, you can't get meaning

03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:08.600
from just knowing facts, like Wikipedia knows more

03:44:08.600 --> 03:44:10.760
than all of us will ever know, right?

03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:13.880
It has no wisdom, you know, wisdom, it means sapien,

03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:16.720
the word wisdom in Latin is sapien, we are wise.

03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:19.560
And by the way, do you know what our real name

03:44:19.560 --> 03:44:21.240
is homo sapien sapien?

03:44:21.240 --> 03:44:23.200
So it's man who knows that he knows.

03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:24.600
Do you know what he knows?

03:44:24.600 --> 03:44:25.680
Do you know what the knowing is?

03:44:25.680 --> 03:44:27.480
It's that he's gonna die.

03:44:27.480 --> 03:44:29.600
We're the only creatures that know that we are gonna die.

03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:31.400
We don't know when we're gonna die,

03:44:31.400 --> 03:44:33.920
but like, you know, I have a cat,

03:44:33.920 --> 03:44:36.560
a fierce attack cat is beautiful.

03:44:36.560 --> 03:44:38.280
She doesn't know when she's gonna die.

03:44:38.280 --> 03:44:40.800
It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than I think I am.

03:44:40.800 --> 03:44:43.720
The survival instinct is fundamentally different

03:44:43.720 --> 03:44:46.480
from like the knowledge of death.

03:44:46.480 --> 03:44:48.120
And that's where the Ernest Becker comes in

03:44:48.120 --> 03:44:52.080
with the terror of death and that that's a creative force

03:44:52.080 --> 03:44:55.640
that seems to be more feature than bug

03:44:55.640 --> 03:44:58.080
about the human condition is that,

03:44:58.880 --> 03:45:03.880
um, I mean, it's a gift of knowing our own mortality.

03:45:05.920 --> 03:45:10.000
Um, yeah, to me, I mean, that's, that's why, you know,

03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:13.560
I agree with you in some sense in terms of the aliens

03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:17.120
not being a thing that solves all mysteries.

03:45:17.120 --> 03:45:20.320
That's why, you know, my love has always been the human mind.

03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:25.320
So understanding who we are, what the hell are we?

03:45:25.360 --> 03:45:29.120
And I think your love has been an echo of that,

03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:31.520
which is where do we come from?

03:45:31.520 --> 03:45:32.360
Yeah.

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:35.520
Or basically as, as cheesy as it sounds, you know,

03:45:36.800 --> 03:45:38.360
Michio Kaku has a way with words.

03:45:38.360 --> 03:45:43.040
I, if you, if you can just like enjoy the, you know,

03:45:43.040 --> 03:45:43.880
Oh, he speaks incomplete.

03:45:43.880 --> 03:45:45.840
He's like Sam Harris of cosmology.

03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:47.520
I mean, he speaks incomplete paragraphs.

03:45:47.520 --> 03:45:51.560
But like also unapologetically, he says, you know,

03:45:51.560 --> 03:45:54.480
we will know God or we will know the mind of God

03:45:54.480 --> 03:45:56.880
or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things.

03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:03.520
That's exciting that physics might be able to find

03:46:03.520 --> 03:46:07.520
equations that unlock our origins at the, at the very core.

03:46:07.520 --> 03:46:10.720
And like the fabric of it all too, and not just our origins,

03:46:11.720 --> 03:46:14.520
you know, what's, you know, what's at the beginning.

03:46:15.480 --> 03:46:18.040
Something tells me we're too dumb to truly understand

03:46:18.040 --> 03:46:19.000
what's at the beginning.

03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:21.240
But I think we should be humble in that way.

03:46:21.240 --> 03:46:23.280
I mean, again, another thing is, you know,

03:46:24.160 --> 03:46:28.320
you ever hear the saying like we shared 99% of our DNA

03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:31.320
with chimps or bonobos or whatever.

03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:33.120
I share like probably more than that.

03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:35.440
You know, sometimes I wish we shared like a hundred percent.

03:46:35.440 --> 03:46:37.280
Like that'd be so much more interesting.

03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:40.360
Like, oh, there's 50% of a fruit fly or banana.

03:46:40.360 --> 03:46:42.600
Like we, no, no, no, there's something,

03:46:42.600 --> 03:46:44.680
but that should make us feel more precious.

03:46:44.680 --> 03:46:48.440
And I almost feel like discovering life on another planet,

03:46:48.440 --> 03:46:52.200
whatever solar system would cause a diminution of humanity.

03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:54.560
Like the one thing I do hold fast to from religion,

03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:55.960
I don't know where I am with God.

03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:57.120
Like, do I believe in God?

03:46:57.120 --> 03:46:59.480
I think that's an unanswerable question.

03:47:00.600 --> 03:47:02.520
But I have some thoughts about it.

03:47:02.520 --> 03:47:06.280
But by the same token, I think the one thing I do get

03:47:06.280 --> 03:47:08.520
from religion is that every human has infinite worth.

03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:10.640
Cause we are in a religious capacity

03:47:10.640 --> 03:47:12.640
considered to be equal to God.

03:47:12.640 --> 03:47:15.320
In other words, we are God's not to be like, you know,

03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:17.000
but we can contemplate what God did.

03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:18.240
We have aspects of God.

03:47:18.240 --> 03:47:19.080
We have free will.

03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:21.360
God had free will if he exists.

03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:23.000
I can't prove that God exists.

03:47:23.000 --> 03:47:24.680
Otherwise you wouldn't have any credit

03:47:24.680 --> 03:47:25.520
for believing in God.

03:47:25.520 --> 03:47:26.360
This is interesting.

03:47:26.360 --> 03:47:29.840
I mean, it's like I'm talking to Einstein here,

03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:31.160
but let me ask anyway.

03:47:31.160 --> 03:47:33.000
Can you clip that for my clips, John?

03:47:34.640 --> 03:47:39.040
For somebody who's looking at the young universe,

03:47:39.040 --> 03:47:44.040
at the early universe and are talking about God

03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:49.440
and are agnostic, who do you think is God?

03:47:49.640 --> 03:47:50.760
Hmm.

03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:54.720
So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts

03:47:54.720 --> 03:47:56.880
with Sam Harris this past summer.

03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:00.920
And one of the things I liked about that conversation

03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:04.800
is he talked a lot about happiness and meditation.

03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:06.560
And he says something that's really resonated with me.

03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:07.640
And I've been working around

03:48:07.640 --> 03:48:09.160
and trying to work on it my own way.

03:48:09.160 --> 03:48:12.880
But he said like, you can never be happy.

03:48:13.920 --> 03:48:16.160
You can only become happy.

03:48:16.160 --> 03:48:18.360
And I'm trying to take it a little bit further than that.

03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:19.680
Because I think it's interesting.

03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:22.240
Meditation is like, you're not like, oh, I'm happy.

03:48:22.240 --> 03:48:24.640
And now like, oh, my kid came in and now I'm not happy.

03:48:24.640 --> 03:48:26.800
They're like, no, you can be satisfied.

03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:28.600
Kurt Vonnegut said, you ever catch this?

03:48:28.600 --> 03:48:29.880
Sometimes Alex, you're like walking around

03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:32.000
and you're like, life is fricking amazing.

03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:32.840
Like I'm happy.

03:48:32.840 --> 03:48:35.440
And Kurt Vonnegut said, you should say to yourself

03:48:35.440 --> 03:48:37.600
every time that happens, like a little mantra,

03:48:37.600 --> 03:48:41.200
if this isn't goodness, if this isn't happiness, nothing is.

03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:43.840
Just remind yourself how awesome it is every breath,

03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:46.080
everything that you do when you make an impact,

03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:48.040
even some of the bad stuff that happens.

03:48:48.680 --> 03:48:49.520
It's good.

03:48:49.520 --> 03:48:51.000
So Sam said that.

03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:53.480
And it made me think, cause I was like, well,

03:48:53.480 --> 03:48:56.880
what does it really mean to be happy?

03:48:56.880 --> 03:49:01.880
Because like, I can think of about two or three ways

03:49:02.200 --> 03:49:04.840
that right now I could double my happiness.

03:49:04.840 --> 03:49:06.480
Now like win the lottery or whatever,

03:49:06.480 --> 03:49:07.560
like I could double my happiness.

03:49:07.560 --> 03:49:08.960
There's only a few ways though, right?

03:49:08.960 --> 03:49:12.760
Like, I had this kind of thought like,

03:49:12.760 --> 03:49:15.320
how many boats can you water ski behind?

03:49:15.320 --> 03:49:17.080
Like you had twice as many followers,

03:49:17.080 --> 03:49:19.480
now you've got 2 million followers, 5 million, whatever.

03:49:19.480 --> 03:49:20.720
It doesn't do anything.

03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:22.000
It's called the hedonic treadmill.

03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:23.200
Like once you get to a certain level,

03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:27.400
it takes a lot more change in followers, money, impact,

03:49:27.400 --> 03:49:30.960
women, whatever you want to make you have one more quanta

03:49:30.960 --> 03:49:32.280
of happiness, right?

03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:36.240
On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy.

03:49:36.240 --> 03:49:37.800
I could make your life miserable

03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:39.640
in an infinite number of ways.

03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:41.520
In other words, there's more space

03:49:41.520 --> 03:49:44.520
to make your life unhappy than happy.

03:49:44.520 --> 03:49:46.200
And so I thought about that in the context

03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:48.760
of what Sam said about happiness.

03:49:48.760 --> 03:49:52.400
So it's sort of like, yeah, it's an expression of entropy.

03:49:52.400 --> 03:49:54.960
And that what you should be doing in life

03:49:54.960 --> 03:49:59.080
is doing that which will cause you devastation

03:49:59.080 --> 03:50:00.760
if it goes away.

03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:02.720
Because those are the things that like

03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:06.240
are where you're reducing entropy, like a kid.

03:50:06.240 --> 03:50:09.200
Like anyone who's a parent knows instantly

03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:10.360
what I'm talking about.

03:50:10.360 --> 03:50:13.880
Like how to make your life a billion times worse.

03:50:13.880 --> 03:50:14.920
But there's no way to make your life

03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:16.440
a billion times better.

03:50:16.440 --> 03:50:17.880
And so thinking about that,

03:50:17.880 --> 03:50:21.160
now turning into the question of God's existence,

03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:24.480
I feel like there's no way that you can believe in God,

03:50:24.480 --> 03:50:26.320
to quote, misquote Sam,

03:50:26.320 --> 03:50:29.440
but there's ways that you can become a believer in God.

03:50:29.440 --> 03:50:31.500
In other words, you could increase

03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:34.680
the Bayesian confidence level that there is some,

03:50:34.680 --> 03:50:36.760
and let's not call it God, because that's a freighted term.

03:50:36.760 --> 03:50:38.960
Let's just call it some infinite source of goodness

03:50:38.960 --> 03:50:42.760
or our beautiful power in the universe, right?

03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:44.080
Simple things can do that.

03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:47.840
You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life.

03:50:47.840 --> 03:50:50.520
And we have this bias as humans towards negativity,

03:50:50.520 --> 03:50:52.120
negativity bias, well-known fact.

03:50:53.080 --> 03:50:55.040
So what I wanna do is,

03:50:55.040 --> 03:50:56.320
let's call God good, right?

03:50:56.320 --> 03:50:58.000
That's where it comes from, God good.

03:50:58.000 --> 03:50:59.700
Same words in German.

03:50:59.700 --> 03:51:02.640
And when we think about what is good,

03:51:02.640 --> 03:51:06.960
let's do those things that would devastate us.

03:51:06.960 --> 03:51:09.960
And a lot of that could be relationships.

03:51:09.960 --> 03:51:14.640
And there's a powerful concept from network theory,

03:51:14.640 --> 03:51:18.480
which is that the number of connections in a network,

03:51:18.480 --> 03:51:19.680
I'm just saying it for your own,

03:51:19.680 --> 03:51:21.720
it grows as the square of the elements in the matrix,

03:51:21.720 --> 03:51:22.680
in the number, right?

03:51:22.680 --> 03:51:24.640
So you think of a matrix with N people,

03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:26.600
you know person one, two, three, four,

03:51:26.600 --> 03:51:28.040
and then there's four other people.

03:51:28.040 --> 03:51:31.680
There's 16 different pairs, but half of them overlap.

03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:34.680
The diagonal is where you know each other, you know yourself.

03:51:34.680 --> 03:51:37.100
But that still grows as N squared.

03:51:37.100 --> 03:51:41.860
So those connections increase and decrease, right?

03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:43.700
You ever have two friends that are fighting

03:51:43.700 --> 03:51:44.940
and like you're kind of upset,

03:51:44.940 --> 03:51:46.660
even though you're not fighting with either one of them.

03:51:46.660 --> 03:51:48.460
So like a network grows like that.

03:51:48.460 --> 03:51:50.620
So you wanna increase your network as much as possible,

03:51:50.620 --> 03:51:54.780
but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.

03:51:54.780 --> 03:51:58.820
And I think in doing so, you make yourself fragile,

03:51:58.820 --> 03:51:59.860
not anti-fragile.

03:51:59.860 --> 03:52:02.420
And I think that is where purpose

03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:05.700
and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.

03:52:05.700 --> 03:52:08.140
So that is a source of meaning,

03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:11.020
maximizing the goodness in life.

03:52:11.020 --> 03:52:13.220
And the way you know it's good,

03:52:13.220 --> 03:52:16.660
as if it's taken away, it would devastate you.

03:52:16.660 --> 03:52:17.480
That's one way.

03:52:19.140 --> 03:52:21.300
Think about it, your brand, your business,

03:52:21.300 --> 03:52:23.460
your spouse, your kids.

03:52:23.460 --> 03:52:26.780
I mean, parents can't, I've known parents that have a lot.

03:52:26.780 --> 03:52:28.700
Jim Simons, here's a perfect example.

03:52:28.700 --> 03:52:30.880
He's one of my oldest friends and mentors.

03:52:31.900 --> 03:52:35.300
He is one of the richest people on earth.

03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:36.980
Gulfstream, Meghayan,

03:52:36.980 --> 03:52:39.860
this is all documented in books about him.

03:52:39.860 --> 03:52:41.700
He lost two sons as adults.

03:52:42.880 --> 03:52:46.420
And I hear people say, oh, I'm so jealous of Jim Simons.

03:52:46.420 --> 03:52:47.760
Would you take everything?

03:52:48.740 --> 03:52:51.100
I don't know where he has that strength

03:52:51.100 --> 03:52:53.940
and his wife, Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara.

03:52:54.980 --> 03:52:57.140
I'm not like that.

03:52:57.140 --> 03:53:01.180
Some people are, there are angels that walk among us.

03:53:01.180 --> 03:53:04.420
And there's this famous prayer, it's like,

03:53:06.300 --> 03:53:08.620
there's an old saying that one of the hardest tests

03:53:08.620 --> 03:53:10.740
there are in life is to be given a lot of money.

03:53:10.740 --> 03:53:12.820
And you see it happens with people

03:53:12.820 --> 03:53:14.240
that win the lottery or whatever,

03:53:14.240 --> 03:53:17.140
or NFL football players after their career's over.

03:53:17.140 --> 03:53:18.780
They're broke, right?

03:53:18.780 --> 03:53:20.860
And I always feel like, God, please test me with money.

03:53:20.860 --> 03:53:21.680
That'd be great.

03:53:21.680 --> 03:53:24.820
But in reality, you should never say I'm gonna,

03:53:24.820 --> 03:53:26.580
I want what X person has,

03:53:26.580 --> 03:53:28.180
unless you're willing to take everything.

03:53:28.180 --> 03:53:30.580
And you'll find you won't wanna take everything.

03:53:31.500 --> 03:53:36.500
Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects of fame,

03:53:37.460 --> 03:53:39.880
of money, of power on people.

03:53:44.140 --> 03:53:45.600
It blinds people.

03:53:47.420 --> 03:53:50.320
And I wonder about that for myself,

03:53:50.320 --> 03:53:53.760
because it seems like in themselves,

03:53:53.760 --> 03:53:58.140
these are definitely not the goals I'm pretty much afraid.

03:53:58.140 --> 03:53:59.820
I'm not desirous,

03:53:59.820 --> 03:54:03.060
and I'm definitely afraid of each of those things,

03:54:03.060 --> 03:54:07.300
money, fame, and power.

03:54:07.300 --> 03:54:11.880
But it seems the dreams I have as consequences

03:54:11.880 --> 03:54:14.280
can often have these things.

03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:16.820
And I'm really afraid of becoming something

03:54:17.700 --> 03:54:20.740
that would disappoint me when I was younger,

03:54:20.740 --> 03:54:23.460
that I wouldn't recognize.

03:54:24.400 --> 03:54:27.220
Because change happens gradually.

03:54:27.220 --> 03:54:30.580
But are you using yourself as the touchstone

03:54:30.580 --> 03:54:32.420
to use the answer?

03:54:32.420 --> 03:54:35.060
What is your rubric to a prize

03:54:35.060 --> 03:54:37.020
if you have lived up to that 12-year-old,

03:54:37.020 --> 03:54:38.900
whatever-year-old lex?

03:54:38.900 --> 03:54:41.940
How will you know or not know if you've let yourself down?

03:54:41.940 --> 03:54:45.100
Or I always think, live to impress yourself.

03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.700
I don't care if I have followers.

03:54:47.700 --> 03:54:50.420
It's nice or whatever, but it's hedonic,

03:54:50.420 --> 03:54:51.700
and it's just never-ending,

03:54:51.700 --> 03:54:53.700
because you'll always see the next level.

03:54:53.700 --> 03:54:54.860
But I think it's pretty damn cool

03:54:54.860 --> 03:54:56.600
that I've gotten to go to these places,

03:54:56.600 --> 03:54:58.160
the South Pole, and I've done these things,

03:54:58.160 --> 03:54:59.600
and I've made a family,

03:54:59.600 --> 03:55:02.440
and I'm able to teleport my values

03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:04.960
into the future through my children.

03:55:04.960 --> 03:55:08.280
And I've had ideological children that I...

03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:11.220
So by what metric have you not already,

03:55:11.220 --> 03:55:13.360
A, impressed yourself, and B, could you let yourself down?

03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:14.200
I don't want to turn to the therapist anymore.

03:55:14.200 --> 03:55:15.960
I think some of it is psychology.

03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:19.320
For me, I'm very much just never,

03:55:19.320 --> 03:55:21.520
I'm highly self-critical.

03:55:21.520 --> 03:55:24.360
I'm never happy, never happy with what I've done.

03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:27.080
But I'm always happy in the way that you described,

03:55:27.080 --> 03:55:29.880
which is that, the Vonnegut thing,

03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:34.040
where you just, often during the day, I will feel,

03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:39.040
I don't know, I just remember just eating beef jerky

03:55:39.200 --> 03:55:40.840
and being truly happy.

03:55:40.840 --> 03:55:44.640
That was just last night, and I have that all the time.

03:55:44.640 --> 03:55:48.940
And that, to me, is why, I mean,

03:55:48.940 --> 03:55:51.280
that feels to me like a healthy way to live life,

03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:55.040
and at least for me, it's the one I really enjoy.

03:55:55.040 --> 03:55:57.640
A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self-critical,

03:55:57.640 --> 03:56:00.520
so hard on yourself is not a good way to go,

03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:02.160
but more and more as I get older,

03:56:02.160 --> 03:56:04.600
I realize it's just who I am.

03:56:04.600 --> 03:56:08.040
You have to a certain point accept,

03:56:08.040 --> 03:56:10.720
this is how I'm always going to be this self-critical.

03:56:10.720 --> 03:56:12.200
It's like the Oracle of Delphi, right?

03:56:12.200 --> 03:56:13.800
You know thyself.

03:56:13.800 --> 03:56:15.120
But I want to leave you with one last thing,

03:56:15.120 --> 03:56:17.600
which is to say, just on this topic,

03:56:17.600 --> 03:56:19.960
you know, it could be different, right?

03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:21.760
We could go down to the ocean

03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:24.520
and get some krill instead of the 7-Eleven.

03:56:24.520 --> 03:56:28.360
You know, it could be that we have no other taste buds,

03:56:28.360 --> 03:56:31.240
and, you know, Eric's talked about the four dimensions

03:56:31.240 --> 03:56:33.480
of the vibration of your tongue, right?

03:56:33.480 --> 03:56:37.280
It could be like there's one, and it's just like,

03:56:37.280 --> 03:56:39.440
not, you know, Memphis barbecue,

03:56:39.440 --> 03:56:42.720
whatever you like in your slim gym.

03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:45.560
It could be something, it could be very boring, similarly.

03:56:45.560 --> 03:56:47.300
What if, like, that's a clue?

03:56:47.300 --> 03:56:49.080
Like, what if that's giving us evidence?

03:56:49.080 --> 03:56:50.680
Here's another clue.

03:56:50.680 --> 03:56:51.560
There are many animals,

03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:54.400
most animals have single monocular vision.

03:56:54.400 --> 03:56:57.000
They only see in black and white intensity.

03:56:57.000 --> 03:56:59.100
They only have rods and no cones.

03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:03.080
We could be like that, but we're not.

03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:04.920
Why is that not a clue?

03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:07.640
Like, if, like, God's not going to, like,

03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:10.120
hit you over the head and say, like, here I am,

03:57:10.120 --> 03:57:11.400
because then everybody would believe in him.

03:57:11.400 --> 03:57:12.920
And there's very simplistic, I've had debates,

03:57:12.920 --> 03:57:15.520
even with, like, famous atheists like Lawrence Krauss,

03:57:15.520 --> 03:57:18.600
who's, like, self-declared militant atheist.

03:57:18.600 --> 03:57:19.720
And I was like, well,

03:57:19.720 --> 03:57:21.880
I don't believe in the same God you don't believe in,

03:57:21.880 --> 03:57:24.200
like, some guy in a white beard and a chair.

03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:25.500
Like, that's infantile.

03:57:25.500 --> 03:57:28.000
Like, I gave that away a long time ago.

03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:29.400
But what if there are clues?

03:57:29.400 --> 03:57:32.640
What if Yang-Mills theory, you know, Maxwell's equation,

03:57:32.640 --> 03:57:35.080
like, those are beautiful.

03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:37.160
If you've ever seen, like, you know,

03:57:37.160 --> 03:57:38.720
expressed in tensor notation,

03:57:38.720 --> 03:57:41.640
Einstein's equations or Maxwell's equations,

03:57:41.640 --> 03:57:44.960
and then Maxwell's equations riding on Einstein's,

03:57:44.960 --> 03:57:47.760
it's unbelievably beautiful.

03:57:47.760 --> 03:57:49.440
It doesn't have to be that way.

03:57:49.440 --> 03:57:52.560
That we can comprehend it, that's a crack.

03:57:52.560 --> 03:57:54.040
Maybe that's where the light gets in,

03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:56.980
and the light is what reveals what's beautiful.

03:57:56.980 --> 03:57:59.080
So I don't believe in God.

03:57:59.080 --> 03:58:00.400
I think that's a stupid notion.

03:58:00.400 --> 03:58:01.760
Like, do I believe in God?

03:58:01.760 --> 03:58:04.520
Like, sometimes I wonder if God believes in me,

03:58:04.520 --> 03:58:06.360
you know, like, more than if I believe in, like,

03:58:06.360 --> 03:58:09.720
he needs Brian Keating, like, you know, what would, you know,

03:58:09.720 --> 03:58:12.680
it's like one of my friends is a rabbi, he's like,

03:58:12.680 --> 03:58:14.840
what would I be doing if I were God?

03:58:14.840 --> 03:58:16.120
Exactly what God's doing right now.

03:58:16.120 --> 03:58:17.760
I'm like, you think I know more than God?

03:58:17.760 --> 03:58:18.600
Give me a break.

03:58:18.600 --> 03:58:23.320
Leaving clues of beauty for these hairless apes.

03:58:23.320 --> 03:58:24.160
Yeah.

03:58:24.160 --> 03:58:26.160
And to see what they do with this,

03:58:26.160 --> 03:58:31.160
and then marvel at both the tragedy

03:58:31.600 --> 03:58:34.560
of what those apes do to each other,

03:58:34.560 --> 03:58:39.520
and the rare moments of when they have,

03:58:39.520 --> 03:58:41.560
when they understand, understand deeply

03:58:41.560 --> 03:58:43.440
about how the world works.

03:58:43.440 --> 03:58:45.280
Brian, you're an incredible human being.

03:58:45.280 --> 03:58:48.480
I'm a big fan and I'm really honored that you was,

03:58:48.480 --> 03:58:51.800
first of all, shower me with rocks from the moon.

03:58:51.800 --> 03:58:52.760
From space.

03:58:52.760 --> 03:58:53.800
From space.

03:58:53.800 --> 03:58:54.640
Space dust.

03:58:54.640 --> 03:58:55.680
The villains.

03:58:55.680 --> 03:58:59.120
And crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals.

03:58:59.120 --> 03:58:59.960
Yeah.

03:58:59.960 --> 03:59:01.760
That you can use for good.

03:59:01.760 --> 03:59:03.640
And tell me your story

03:59:03.640 --> 03:59:05.760
and spend your really valuable time with me today.

03:59:05.760 --> 03:59:06.720
This was amazing.

03:59:06.720 --> 03:59:08.000
That was a great pleasure for me, Lex.

03:59:08.000 --> 03:59:09.000
Thank you so much.

03:59:10.000 --> 03:59:11.720
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:59:11.720 --> 03:59:12.880
with Brian Keating.

03:59:12.880 --> 03:59:14.240

03:59:17.400 --> 03:59:19.440
And now let me leave you with some words

03:59:19.440 --> 03:59:21.120
from Galileo Galilei.

03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:23.680
In questions of science,

03:59:23.680 --> 03:59:26.080
the authority of a thousand is not worth

03:59:26.080 --> 03:59:29.680
the humble reasoning of a single individual.

03:59:29.680 --> 03:59:32.680
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
