00:00.000 --> 00:01.560
When we use the term free will,

00:01.560 --> 00:04.600
we're talking about this feeling that consciousness,

00:04.600 --> 00:08.200
that we have a self, that there's this concrete thing

00:08.200 --> 00:11.360
that's separate from brain processing

00:11.360 --> 00:15.060
that somehow swoops in and is the cause of our decision

00:15.060 --> 00:17.040
or the cause of our next action.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.760
And that is in large part,

00:19.760 --> 00:22.040
if not in its entirety, an illusion.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.980
The following is a conversation with Annika Harris,

00:26.980 --> 00:28.680
author of Conscious,

00:28.720 --> 00:32.640
a brief guide to the fundamental mystery of the mind.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.280
And it's someone who writes and thinks a lot

00:35.280 --> 00:39.120
about the nature of consciousness and of reality,

00:39.120 --> 00:43.400
especially from the perspectives of physics and neuroscience.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.400
This is the Lux Freedom Podcast.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
To support it,

00:46.400 --> 00:48.920
please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:48.920 --> 00:52.520
And now, dear friends, here's Annika Harris.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.840
In your book, Conscious,

00:54.840 --> 00:58.000
you described evidence that free will is an illusion

00:58.000 --> 01:00.800
and that consciousness is used to construct this illusion

01:00.800 --> 01:02.480
and convince ourselves

01:02.480 --> 01:05.200
that we are in fact deciding our actions.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.320
Can you explain this?

01:06.320 --> 01:07.760
I think this is chapter three.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.040
First of all, I really think it's important

01:10.040 --> 01:13.600
to make a distinction between free will and conscious will.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.640
And we'll get into that in a moment.

01:15.640 --> 01:20.040
So free will in terms of our brain as a system in nature,

01:20.040 --> 01:21.960
making complex decisions

01:21.960 --> 01:25.200
and doing all of the complex processing it does,

01:25.200 --> 01:28.080
there is a decision-making process in nature

01:28.080 --> 01:32.280
that our brains undergo that we can call free will.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.960
That's fine to use that shorthand for that.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.840
Although once we get into the details,

01:36.840 --> 01:40.400
I might convince you that it's not so free.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.280
But the decision-making process is a process in nature.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.640
The feeling, our conscious experience of feeling

01:47.640 --> 01:52.640
like consciousness is the thing that is driving the behavior.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.720
That is, I would say in most cases, an illusion.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.440
And usually when we talk about free will,

02:01.440 --> 02:02.680
that's the thing we're talking about.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.520
I mean, sometimes it's in conjunction

02:04.520 --> 02:06.080
with the decision-making process,

02:06.080 --> 02:08.960
but for the most part, when we use the term free will,

02:08.960 --> 02:12.360
we're talking about this feeling that consciousness,

02:12.360 --> 02:15.640
that we have a self, that there's this concrete thing

02:15.640 --> 02:18.760
that's separate from brain processing

02:18.760 --> 02:20.400
that somehow swoops in

02:20.640 --> 02:22.680
and is the cause of our decision

02:22.680 --> 02:24.680
or the cause of our next action.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.920
And that is in large part, if not in its entirety,

02:28.920 --> 02:29.800
an illusion.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.000
So conscious will is an illusion,

02:32.000 --> 02:33.200
and then we can try to figure out-

02:33.200 --> 02:35.720
Free will, I would say, is good shorthand

02:35.720 --> 02:37.240
for a process in nature,

02:37.240 --> 02:40.200
which is a decision-making process of the brain.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.040
But decisions are still being made.

02:42.040 --> 02:42.880
So there's,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.120
if you ran the universe over again,

02:48.920 --> 02:52.800
is there, would it turn out the same way?

02:52.800 --> 02:55.480
I mean, maybe, I'm trying to sneak up to like,

02:55.480 --> 02:57.280
what does it mean to make a decision

02:57.280 --> 03:01.200
in a way that's almost, that means something?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.040
So, right.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.040
So this is where our intuitions get challenged.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.520
I've been thinking about some new examples for this,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.720
just because I talk about it a lot.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.880
And the truth is, most of the things I write about

03:11.880 --> 03:14.640
and talk about and think about are so counterintuitive.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.840
I mean, that's really what my game is,

03:16.840 --> 03:19.840
is breaking intuitions, shaking up intuitions,

03:19.840 --> 03:23.160
in order to get a deeper understanding of reality.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.880
I'm often, even though I've thought about this

03:26.880 --> 03:28.800
for 20 years and think about it all the time,

03:28.800 --> 03:30.880
it's an obsession of mine, really.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.520
I have to get back into that mind frame

03:35.720 --> 03:37.120
to be able to think clearly about it,

03:37.120 --> 03:38.720
because it is so counterintuitive.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.400
How long does that take?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.240
How hard is that?

03:41.240 --> 03:42.680
Depends on if there are kids around,

03:42.680 --> 03:44.840
or if I'm alone, or if I've been meditating.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.520
But what I was going to say, actually,

03:46.520 --> 03:48.920
I felt like we need to just take one step back

03:50.080 --> 03:51.120
and talk a little bit,

03:51.120 --> 03:54.960
just because I think the importance of shaking up intuitions

03:54.960 --> 03:57.920
for scientific advancement

03:57.920 --> 04:02.440
is such an important piece of the scientific process.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.800
And I think we've reached a point in consciousness studies

04:05.800 --> 04:10.600
where it's very difficult to move forward.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.720
And usually that's a sign

04:12.720 --> 04:14.920
that we need to start shaking up our intuitions.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.240
So throughout history, the huge breakthroughs,

04:18.240 --> 04:21.440
the things that have really shifted our view of the universe

04:21.440 --> 04:24.040
and our place in the universe and all of that,

04:24.040 --> 04:26.120
those almost always, if not always,

04:26.120 --> 04:29.840
require that we, at the very least,

04:29.840 --> 04:33.600
shift our intuitions, update our intuitions,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.080
but many of them we just have to let go of intuitions

04:36.080 --> 04:37.960
that are feeding us false information

04:37.960 --> 04:39.920
about the way the world works.

04:39.920 --> 04:41.600
Well, the weirdest thing here is that

04:41.600 --> 04:44.760
here we're looking at our own mind.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.680
So you have to let go of your intuitions

04:50.200 --> 04:51.920
about your own intuitions.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.560
Yeah, right, exactly.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.760
It's very meta and makes it hard.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.760
And it's part of the reason why doing interviews for me

04:59.760 --> 05:01.880
feels so difficult, aside from the fact

05:01.880 --> 05:04.840
that I just have social anxiety in general.

05:04.840 --> 05:05.680
Well, it's good,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.200
because I took mushrooms just before we started.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.480
Perfect, that's what I should have done.

05:09.480 --> 05:12.080
We're on this journey together, let's go.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.240
So where do we take a step backwards?

05:14.760 --> 05:15.600
I was going to say,

05:15.600 --> 05:17.800
I mean, this leads into the point I was going to make,

05:17.800 --> 05:19.760
but what I was going to say is,

05:19.760 --> 05:21.880
I mean, also just for me, I feel like

05:23.880 --> 05:26.720
I'm not as good at speaking as I am at writing,

05:26.720 --> 05:28.280
that I'm clear in my writing.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.440
And because these topics are so difficult

05:30.440 --> 05:31.840
to get our minds around,

05:33.360 --> 05:38.360
it's hard to kind of get to any real conclusion in real time.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.320
It's actually how I started writing my book,

05:42.320 --> 05:43.600
was just writing for myself.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.760
I decided that I needed to spend some time

05:45.760 --> 05:47.120
writing down all of my thoughts

05:47.120 --> 05:50.920
in order to get clear about how I think about them.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.440
So you write down a sentence and you think in the silence.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.960
Paragraphs. Paragraphs, and you just.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.600
And then I see if that makes sense,

05:59.600 --> 06:01.040
and then I check it with my intuitions,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.640
which is really the scientific process.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.360
And I really, in many ways,

06:04.360 --> 06:06.560
I feel like I'm a physicist at heart.

06:06.560 --> 06:10.280
All of my inquiry, all of my career,

06:10.280 --> 06:11.480
everything I'm interested in,

06:11.480 --> 06:14.640
actually going back to being a child,

06:14.640 --> 06:19.160
is just deep curiosity about how the world works,

06:19.160 --> 06:24.160
what this place is, what it's made of, how we got here,

06:24.320 --> 06:26.200
just being amazed at the fact

06:26.200 --> 06:28.200
that I'm having an experience over here

06:28.200 --> 06:29.560
and you're having one over there,

06:29.560 --> 06:31.720
and we're in this moment of time.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.040
And what does that all mean?

06:34.040 --> 06:37.160
My interest in consciousness really came out of,

06:37.160 --> 06:38.880
originally an interest in physics.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.240
And I guess that the two were always side by side.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.480
And I didn't really connect them until I was older,

06:43.480 --> 06:47.000
but I've always been really interested

06:47.000 --> 06:51.760
in just understanding the nature of reality

06:51.760 --> 06:54.600
before I even had the language to describe it.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.560
You talked about sort of laying down

06:57.560 --> 06:59.000
and looking up at the stars,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.440
and sort of trying to let go of the intuition

07:02.440 --> 07:05.120
that there's a ground below us,

07:05.120 --> 07:06.840
which is a really interesting exercise.

07:06.840 --> 07:09.040
And there's many exercises of this sort you can do,

07:09.040 --> 07:10.440
but that's a really good one.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.280
Well, and I think scientists and children

07:14.280 --> 07:15.920
who will become scientists,

07:15.920 --> 07:18.200
who are just kind of scientists at heart,

07:18.200 --> 07:20.160
really enjoy that feeling

07:20.160 --> 07:22.680
of breaking through their intuitions.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.400
And I remember the first time it happened actually,

07:25.400 --> 07:28.960
I was playing with marbles.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.440
And marbles have all these different shapes,

07:32.440 --> 07:34.000
each one is unique and they're all these,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.920
it looks like there's liquid inside them.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.560
And I remember asking my father

07:39.560 --> 07:41.920
how they got the liquid inside the glass ball.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.000
And he said, actually, it's solid all the way through,

07:44.000 --> 07:45.160
it's all glass.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.680
And I had such a hard time imagining,

07:47.680 --> 07:48.520
it just didn't seem right to me.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.000
I was very young when I,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.040
but he's a complicated person,

07:52.040 --> 07:53.760
but he was wonderful in this way

07:53.760 --> 07:57.160
and that he would kind of entertain my curiosity.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.920
And so he said, let's open them up.

07:59.920 --> 08:02.400
And he got a towel and we put the marbles on the towel

08:02.400 --> 08:04.120
and got a hammer and he smashed them all.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.240
And lo and behold, it was all glass.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.120
And I remember, it's like the first time

08:09.120 --> 08:12.800
I had that feeling of realizing,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.560
wow, the truth was so different from what I expected.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.600
And I like that feeling.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.520
And of course we need to be able to do that

08:20.520 --> 08:23.200
to understand that the earth is flat,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.280
to understand the germ theory of disease,

08:25.280 --> 08:29.040
to understand long processes in nature like evolution.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.320
I mean, we just can never really intuit

08:31.320 --> 08:33.920
that we share genes with ants.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.600
Did you just say the earth is flat?

08:35.600 --> 08:37.040
You mean the earth is not flat.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.000
Did I say that? Yeah, this is great.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.120
Exactly, see, this is why I need to write and not speak.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.640
Well, I actually really like conspiracy theories and so on.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.520
I really like flat earth,

08:48.520 --> 08:49.960
people that believe the earth is flat

08:49.960 --> 08:52.960
or not believe but argue for the earth is flat.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.560
Well, it's interesting because you can see,

08:54.560 --> 08:55.880
I mean, the intuition is so strong.

08:55.880 --> 08:56.720
I just said it.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.960
The thing I love about folks who argue for flat earth

08:59.960 --> 09:03.600
is they are thinking deeply,

09:03.600 --> 09:07.240
they're questioning actually what has not become intuition

09:08.240 --> 09:09.800
it's become the mainstream narrative

09:09.800 --> 09:10.920
that the earth is round,

09:10.920 --> 09:14.120
where people actually don't,

09:16.360 --> 09:19.200
yeah, don't think actually how crazy it is

09:19.200 --> 09:20.960
that the earth is round.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.680
Wearing a ball.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.280
And like, that's exactly what you're doing.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.120
You're looking out at the space.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.160
It's really humbling.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.880
Because I think the basic intuition

09:29.880 --> 09:32.040
when you're walking on the ground,

09:32.040 --> 09:35.960
you kind of, there's a underlying belief

09:35.960 --> 09:37.800
that earth is the center of the universe.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.240
There's a kind of feeling like this is the only world

09:41.240 --> 09:44.000
that exists and you kind of know

09:44.000 --> 09:45.840
that there's a huge universe out there

09:45.840 --> 09:47.880
but you don't really load that information in.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.400
And I think flat earthers are really contending

09:51.400 --> 09:53.320
with those big ideas.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.520
Yeah, no, and I think, I mean,

09:54.520 --> 09:58.640
the truth is that when those observations were first made,

09:58.640 --> 10:00.760
when the celestial observations were made

10:00.760 --> 10:03.320
that revealed this fact to us,

10:03.320 --> 10:04.760
I can't remember how long it took,

10:04.760 --> 10:06.640
but I think it was close to a hundred years

10:06.640 --> 10:11.600
before it was actually accepted as common knowledge

10:11.600 --> 10:13.800
that we're no longer the center of the universe

10:13.800 --> 10:15.880
or of course we never were, but,

10:15.880 --> 10:19.040
and that's true almost every time

10:19.040 --> 10:20.960
we have a breakthrough like that,

10:20.960 --> 10:23.120
that challenges our intuitions.

10:23.120 --> 10:28.120
There's usually a period of time where we have to,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.000
and this is an important part of the process

10:30.000 --> 10:32.800
because often our intuitions give us good information.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.720
And so when the science goes against,

10:35.720 --> 10:38.960
when our scientific observations go against our intuitions,

10:38.960 --> 10:43.320
it's important for us to let that in

10:43.320 --> 10:46.120
and to see which side is gonna win.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.680
And once it's clear that the evidence is winning,

10:49.680 --> 10:52.280
then there's this period of time where we have to grapple

10:52.280 --> 10:56.000
with our intuitions and shift the way we frame

10:56.000 --> 10:59.040
our worldview and go through that process.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.480
But free will.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.320
Free will is a hard one.

11:01.680 --> 11:02.840
It's a hard one.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.440
So here we are still, in consciousness studies,

11:07.440 --> 11:10.240
pretty stuck, at least in terms of the neuroscience.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.360
And so that's why I started thinking more deeply about that.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.160
That's why a lot of scientists right now

11:16.160 --> 11:19.240
are actually interested in studying consciousness,

11:19.240 --> 11:20.880
where it was very taboo before.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.400
And so we're at this really interesting turning point

11:23.400 --> 11:26.960
and it's wonderful, but it will require

11:26.960 --> 11:29.920
that we shake up our intuitions a bit

11:29.920 --> 11:33.080
and reframe some things and look at what

11:33.080 --> 11:35.480
the neuroscience is telling us.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.080
And there are a lot of questions.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.920
We have more questions than answers.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.680
But I think it's time, I think if we're going

11:42.680 --> 11:45.080
to make progress in consciousness studies,

11:45.080 --> 11:50.080
we need to start really looking at the illusions

11:50.200 --> 11:52.640
and false intuitions that are getting in our way.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.800
Do you think studying the brain can give us clues

11:54.800 --> 11:56.480
about free will, like some of these questions?

11:56.480 --> 11:57.320
Oh yeah, absolutely.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.280
I think it already has.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.400
And I think many facts that have come out of neuroscience

12:02.400 --> 12:05.360
are still barely seeping into the culture.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.880
I mean, I think this is gonna be a long process.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.840
So part of my work is really just looking at areas

12:11.840 --> 12:15.760
where we already know some of our intuitions are wrong

12:15.760 --> 12:19.600
and starting to accept them and starting to let them in

12:19.600 --> 12:20.800
and starting to ask questions about,

12:20.800 --> 12:22.520
well, what does this mean then

12:22.520 --> 12:24.920
about the nature of consciousness?

12:24.960 --> 12:28.000
Let's try to actually get into this question

12:28.000 --> 12:30.120
of free will and conscious will.

12:30.120 --> 12:34.200
I have, my intuitions here are, I mean, I'm a human being.

12:34.200 --> 12:38.760
It's really, I mean, I approach it from two aspects.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.600
One is a human being and two, from a robotics perspective.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.240
And I wonder how big the gap between the two is.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.280
And that's a useful, from an engineer perspective

12:50.280 --> 12:52.960
is another perspective that's useful

12:52.960 --> 12:54.800
and helpful to take on this.

12:55.680 --> 12:58.360
It's like, are we really so different, you and I,

12:58.360 --> 13:00.920
the robot and the human?

13:00.920 --> 13:02.840
You'd like to believe so,

13:02.840 --> 13:06.360
but you don't exactly see where the difference is.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.160
Research into AI and just the fact

13:08.160 --> 13:10.440
that it's entered our consciousness

13:10.440 --> 13:12.760
at the level of stories and film

13:12.760 --> 13:15.880
and all of these questions that it's raising

13:17.760 --> 13:20.200
is facing us with that.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.920
It's almost like the zombie experiment

13:23.080 --> 13:24.080
is coming to life for us.

13:24.080 --> 13:29.080
We're more and more looking at human-like systems

13:30.240 --> 13:32.880
and wondering, is there an experience in there

13:32.880 --> 13:34.920
and how can we figure that out?

13:34.920 --> 13:37.240
When you were talking about your experience

13:37.240 --> 13:40.640
of looking at robots, it reminds me of how I,

13:40.640 --> 13:42.840
for many years, have been looking at plants.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.080
Because the plant behavior,

13:45.080 --> 13:46.480
and actually this is the example,

13:46.480 --> 13:47.640
maybe we'll just try it out.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.600
It may not work.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
This is an example I was thinking of recently

13:50.600 --> 13:54.960
because I was reading back on the work of Mark Jaffe,

13:54.960 --> 13:57.840
who did this research with pea tendrils.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.800
I'm sure he did many other plant studies,

13:59.800 --> 14:01.840
but this is the one I was reading about.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.080
I'm hoping this analogy, I'll just set it up.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.400
I'm hoping that this analogy will be something

14:06.400 --> 14:08.400
that we can keep coming back to as we move forward

14:08.400 --> 14:12.120
because as we shake up our intuitions and get confused

14:12.120 --> 14:13.960
and then we come back to our intuitions

14:13.960 --> 14:15.080
and say, no, that just can't be.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.400
I think this analogy might be helpful.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.240
What kind of plant was he working on?

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
Pea tendrils.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.440
So a pea plant has these tendrils.

14:22.440 --> 14:25.520
You can picture them, they coil.

14:26.840 --> 14:31.280
So I don't know what year this research was done.

14:31.280 --> 14:34.840
I'm guessing in the 80s, but some-

14:34.840 --> 14:37.520
But pea tendrils have been around long before that.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.680
Yes, of course.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.360
And the research may have happened long before the 80s.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.120
In fact, they might be doing the research on the humans,

14:43.120 --> 14:44.320
but that's another story.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.160
Yeah, right.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.600
Pea tendrils as a system, generally,

14:50.600 --> 14:52.120
there are a few more things they can do,

14:52.120 --> 14:55.000
but generally they can behave in two ways.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.280
They can grow in a straight line slowly

14:58.120 --> 15:02.840
or they can grow in this coil form more quickly.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.680
And what happens is when they are growing

15:06.680 --> 15:11.400
in a straight manner and they encounter a branch or a pole

15:11.400 --> 15:14.000
or something else that it can wrap itself around

15:14.040 --> 15:17.040
to gain more stability, when it senses a branch there,

15:17.040 --> 15:19.240
that gives it the cue to start growing

15:19.240 --> 15:21.320
at a more rapid pace and to start coiling

15:21.320 --> 15:23.400
instead of growing straight.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.800
So it has these two behaviors.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.840
As a system, it's capable of growing straight

15:26.840 --> 15:28.400
and it's capable of coiling.

15:29.520 --> 15:31.640
One interesting thing, actually, I'll just add this.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.720
It's not totally relevant,

15:32.720 --> 15:35.920
but one interesting thing is Mark Jaffe's work.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.240
So he cut a pea tendril.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.960
He was curious to see if it could do this on its own,

15:40.960 --> 15:42.640
separate from the rest of the plant.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.680
So he cut a pea tendril off the plant.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.960
If you keep it in a moist, warm environment,

15:47.960 --> 15:50.480
it will continue to behave in these ways.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.600
So it will continue to coil.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.040
If he noticed that if he touched one end of it,

15:55.040 --> 15:58.200
if he rubbed one side of it, that gave it enough of a cue

15:58.200 --> 16:00.000
that it would start to coil.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.880
And then he noticed that it needed light

16:02.880 --> 16:04.400
to perform this action.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.800
So in the dark, when he rubbed the edge of the tendril,

16:08.800 --> 16:10.920
it did not coil.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.200
In the light, it would.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.160
And then he recognized this further fact,

16:15.160 --> 16:18.760
which was that the pea tendril that he rubbed in the dark

16:18.760 --> 16:20.360
that was still straight,

16:20.360 --> 16:22.040
if he brought it out into the light,

16:22.040 --> 16:25.400
and this could be hours later, it would start to coil.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.520
It has a primitive form of memory

16:28.520 --> 16:31.920
where it has the sensation

16:31.920 --> 16:34.080
and then it holds onto that information.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.880
And as soon as there's light, it acts on that information.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.720
But also in the kind of distributed intelligence,

16:39.720 --> 16:43.560
because you can separate it from the main part.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.240
Like if you chop off a human arm,

16:45.240 --> 16:48.600
it's not gonna keep growing.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.840
Even if you keep it in a moist, warm environment,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.960
it's not gonna reach out for the cup of coffee

16:52.960 --> 16:54.080
when you come in with Starbucks.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.520
Maybe in the correct environment,

16:56.520 --> 16:58.440
maybe we just haven't found the environment.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.920
But anyway, that's pretty amazing.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.080
So that's a separate fact.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.040
But anyway, so if you just use the analogy of a pea tendril,

17:05.040 --> 17:07.840
and if you imagine, which is something I like to do a lot,

17:07.840 --> 17:10.280
if you imagine this plant

17:10.280 --> 17:12.280
has some kind of conscious experience,

17:12.280 --> 17:13.920
of course it doesn't have complex thought,

17:13.920 --> 17:16.800
it doesn't have anything like a human experience.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.440
But if it were possible for a plant

17:19.440 --> 17:21.920
to have some felt experience,

17:21.920 --> 17:26.640
you can imagine that when it comes into contact

17:26.640 --> 17:29.200
with a branch and starts to coil,

17:29.200 --> 17:33.400
that that feeling could be one of deciding to do that,

17:33.400 --> 17:36.600
or that it feels good to do that, or kind of wanting.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.720
I mean, that's too complex, that's anthropomorphizing.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.360
But there's a way in which you could imagine

17:42.360 --> 17:44.280
this pea tendril under those circumstances

17:44.280 --> 17:45.960
suddenly wants to start coiling.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.320
So you're saying you try to meditate

17:48.320 --> 17:52.200
at what it's like to be a pea tendril, a plant.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.680
Like that's what's required here.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.640
So you have to empathize with a plant,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.760
or with another organism that's not human.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.200
Yeah, and you don't actually need that for this analogy,

18:01.200 --> 18:02.760
the larger analogy that I'm getting at.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.760
But I think that's an interesting piece to keep in mind,

18:04.800 --> 18:07.280
that you could imagine that in nature,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.720
if there's a conscious experience associated

18:09.720 --> 18:11.960
with a pea tendril, that at that moment,

18:11.960 --> 18:16.000
what that feels like is a want

18:16.000 --> 18:17.720
to start moving in a different way.

18:17.720 --> 18:21.160
So you wanna imagine that without anthropomorphizing,

18:21.160 --> 18:23.640
so without projecting the human experience,

18:23.640 --> 18:25.800
but rather sort of humbling yourself

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
that we're just another plant with more complexity.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.600
Yes, in a way. Like trying to see where.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.320
Exactly, so yeah, that's where I'm going with this.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.240
And when you start making that connection,

18:37.240 --> 18:40.440
you can see where there are a few points

18:40.440 --> 18:43.400
at which there's room for an illusion to come in

18:43.400 --> 18:45.160
for our own feelings of will.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.280
So when we move from a pea tendril

18:47.280 --> 18:49.160
to human decision-making,

18:49.160 --> 18:52.280
obviously human decision-making,

18:52.280 --> 18:56.200
human brains are many, many, many times more complex

18:56.200 --> 18:57.920
than whatever is going on in a pea tendril.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.640
I mean, the brain is actually the most complex thing

19:00.640 --> 19:03.600
we know of in the universe thus far.

19:03.640 --> 19:08.440
So there is the genes that help develop the brain

19:08.440 --> 19:10.160
into any particular brain, into what it is.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.240
There are all the inputs.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.120
There are countless factors that we could never,

19:14.120 --> 19:17.920
I mean, it may as well be an infinite number of factors.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.920
And then in that particular moment,

19:19.920 --> 19:22.320
whatever the inputs are to a brain,

19:22.320 --> 19:25.560
the brain is capable of almost

19:25.560 --> 19:27.320
an infinite number of outputs, right?

19:27.320 --> 19:31.360
So if you, if I walked in here this morning and you said,

19:31.360 --> 19:33.200
would you like water or tea?

19:34.680 --> 19:36.560
And that's, you know, simple decision for me to-

19:36.560 --> 19:37.960
I think that's a passive aggressive way of telling me

19:37.960 --> 19:40.840
I should have offered you some tea.

19:40.840 --> 19:41.680
But yes, go on.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.840
No, I wanted water.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.200
Okay, all right.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.600
I actually asked for water.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.320
Okay, all right, great.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.680
And you didn't have any free will anyway,

19:48.680 --> 19:49.680
so it doesn't matter.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.520
I don't hold you responsible for any of it.

19:51.520 --> 19:55.720
Exactly, I was just running an algorithm deterministically.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.520
You could, you give me this decision, right,

19:57.520 --> 19:59.120
to make water or tea.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.760
Go back to the pea tendril for a second.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.520
A pea tendril is capable of growing

20:02.520 --> 20:05.480
in a straight line slowly or in a coil quickly.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.480
My brain is capable of all kinds of responses

20:09.480 --> 20:13.840
to that question, even though you've given me two options.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.840
You could offer me water or tea

20:15.840 --> 20:17.960
and I could just run out of the room screaming

20:17.960 --> 20:18.800
if I wanted to, right?

20:18.800 --> 20:20.960
It happens to me all the time on dates.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.920
Nevermind, I don't wanna do this.

20:22.920 --> 20:23.760
Yes.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.880
The fact that the brain is capable,

20:27.880 --> 20:29.560
that there's so many inputs

20:29.600 --> 20:32.800
and then the brain is capable of so many outputs,

20:32.800 --> 20:36.800
as a system, what it's hard for us to get our minds around

20:36.800 --> 20:41.680
is that it may not be capable of any behavior

20:41.680 --> 20:44.040
in every moment in time.

20:44.040 --> 20:47.280
So as a system, it's capable of doing all kinds of things.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.120
And the point I'm making is that

20:52.840 --> 20:56.040
if we could see all of the factors leading up

20:56.040 --> 20:57.840
to the moment where I chose water

20:57.840 --> 21:00.000
or where I ran screaming from the room,

21:01.160 --> 21:06.160
we could, in fact, see that there was no other behavior

21:06.160 --> 21:10.160
I was going to or could have exhibited in that moment

21:10.160 --> 21:12.800
in the same way that when the pea tendril hits the branch,

21:12.800 --> 21:13.880
it starts coiling.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.280
There's a parallel, which is very interesting,

21:16.280 --> 21:20.080
in robotics with fish and water.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.480
So you could see the experiments with dead fish

21:23.480 --> 21:25.320
and they keep swimming.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.720
So the fish is capable of all kinds

21:28.720 --> 21:31.760
of complicated movements as a system,

21:31.760 --> 21:35.120
but in any one moment, the river,

21:35.120 --> 21:36.920
the full complexity of the river

21:36.920 --> 21:40.080
defines the actual movement of the fish.

21:40.080 --> 21:41.160
And that's deficient.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.800
Well, and I should also, I mean,

21:42.800 --> 21:43.920
this brings up another point,

21:43.920 --> 21:45.840
which is that there is a difference

21:45.840 --> 21:48.400
between voluntary and involuntary behavior.

21:48.400 --> 21:53.080
So of course we have reflexes and it is a different,

21:53.120 --> 21:56.560
there's different brain processing in action

21:56.560 --> 22:00.080
when I make a decision about water or tea,

22:00.080 --> 22:02.600
then there is, you know,

22:02.600 --> 22:05.120
if my behavior is forced from the outside,

22:05.120 --> 22:08.720
or if I have a brain tumor that's causing me

22:08.720 --> 22:11.640
to make certain decisions or feel certain feelings.

22:11.640 --> 22:14.760
And so the point is that at bottom,

22:14.760 --> 22:17.520
it's all brain processing and behavior,

22:17.520 --> 22:22.480
but the reason why certain actions feel willed,

22:22.480 --> 22:25.280
there's a good reason why it feels that way.

22:25.280 --> 22:29.880
And it's to distinguish our own self-generated behavior

22:29.880 --> 22:32.840
based on thinking and, you know,

22:32.840 --> 22:35.280
possibly weighing the different results of different things.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.600
I already had caffeine today.

22:36.600 --> 22:37.440
I don't want more.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.400
You know, there are all these processes,

22:40.400 --> 22:43.280
things that we can point to and things that we can't,

22:43.280 --> 22:46.200
things I'm affected by at a subconscious level.

22:46.800 --> 22:51.800
And that is very different from an unwilled action

22:52.680 --> 22:54.320
or a reflex or something like that.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.080
And so some people I can imagine,

22:56.080 --> 22:57.480
I haven't used the p-tendril example,

22:57.480 --> 22:58.880
but I can imagine they wouldn't like that

22:58.880 --> 23:03.360
because the p-tendril sounds more to them like a reflex

23:03.360 --> 23:06.480
and that doesn't address the question

23:06.480 --> 23:10.480
of a much more complex decision-making process.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.720
But I think at bottom, that is what it is.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.080
And that's really where the illusion of free will

23:17.080 --> 23:18.160
and the illusion of self,

23:18.160 --> 23:19.880
which I think is there kind of two sides

23:19.880 --> 23:21.840
of the same coin come from.

23:21.840 --> 23:25.000
So even when we intellectually understand

23:25.000 --> 23:26.320
that everything we're feeling,

23:26.320 --> 23:30.560
everything we're doing is based on our brain processing

23:30.560 --> 23:32.520
and brain behavior, if you're a physicalist,

23:32.520 --> 23:33.720
you've bought into that.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.680
Even when you intellectually understand that,

23:37.680 --> 23:39.960
we, and I include myself in this,

23:39.960 --> 23:43.160
we still have this feeling that there's something

23:43.160 --> 23:45.880
that stands outside of the brain processing

23:45.880 --> 23:47.080
that can intervene.

23:47.080 --> 23:49.320
And that's the illusion.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.200
I was tweeting with someone recently,

23:51.200 --> 23:52.280
which I almost never do,

23:52.280 --> 23:55.000
but we're working in the TED documentary

23:55.000 --> 23:55.840
that I'm making right now.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.400
We're working on the episode on free will.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.360
So I was allowing myself to go back and forth

24:01.360 --> 24:03.600
in a way that I don't usually on Twitter.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.440
Like arguing?

24:04.440 --> 24:05.280
About free will.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.960
It was a friendly debate.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.280
Gonna go into the reasons why I'm not crazy about Twitter,

24:09.280 --> 24:11.240
but let's leave that for another time.

24:11.240 --> 24:15.400
I mean, talk about how hard it is to have this conversation

24:15.400 --> 24:18.360
when we have as many hours as we like,

24:18.360 --> 24:20.360
trying to do it in sound bites over Twitter.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.400
See, I like how you made the decision now

24:22.400 --> 24:23.840
not to talk about Twitter.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.200
Well, my brain.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.040
Road less traveled.

24:27.040 --> 24:30.440
That was one of the things I said to this person was,

24:30.440 --> 24:33.120
because someone chimed in and said,

24:33.120 --> 24:35.080
you said I, what do you mean by I?

24:35.080 --> 24:37.320
And so actually that's another point I could make,

24:37.320 --> 24:41.920
which is, first, my response to that was,

24:41.920 --> 24:43.480
well, people tend to get creeped out

24:43.480 --> 24:47.000
when I say the system that is my brain and body

24:47.000 --> 24:50.360
that we call Anika recommends, you know?

24:50.360 --> 24:51.760
Why do they get freaked out?

24:52.760 --> 24:54.560
Oh, you mean like in your personal life?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.920
Instead of like never saying I, yeah.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.440
Always, you know, but I always refer to you

24:59.440 --> 25:01.880
as the brain and body we call Lex.

25:01.880 --> 25:02.720
Yes.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.800
Well, I don't know.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.960
That's kind of charming in a way.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.000
So I and you are very useful shorthand,

25:11.000 --> 25:13.280
even though at some level they're illusions.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.400
They're very useful shorthand for the system

25:17.400 --> 25:21.720
of my brain really and my body, the whole system,

25:21.720 --> 25:23.120
that I is useful for that,

25:23.120 --> 25:25.320
but the illusion is when we feel like

25:25.320 --> 25:27.440
there's something outside of that system

25:27.440 --> 25:29.400
that can intervene, that is free,

25:29.400 --> 25:32.400
that's somehow free from the physical world.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.880
I can have the thought,

25:34.880 --> 25:39.200
yeah, I really not crazy about having intellectual

25:39.200 --> 25:43.480
back and forth on Twitter and then feel like I decide

25:43.480 --> 25:45.120
to not follow that thought, right?

25:45.120 --> 25:47.840
And the feeling, that's the feeling

25:48.760 --> 25:50.040
where the illusion comes in

25:50.040 --> 25:52.120
because it really feels as if,

25:52.120 --> 25:55.080
sure, my brain had that original thought

25:55.080 --> 25:58.800
and then I came in and made a different decision.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.400
But of course, the truth is

26:00.400 --> 26:02.160
it was just further brain processing

26:02.240 --> 26:05.600
that got me to decide not to go down that path.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.160
How much is that feeling of conscious will

26:08.160 --> 26:11.760
is culturally constructed shorthand?

26:11.760 --> 26:15.600
So like I and you is a,

26:15.600 --> 26:19.320
you could say a culturally constructed shorthand.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.920
How much of that affects how we think?

26:22.920 --> 26:26.520
So our parents say I and you, I and you,

26:26.520 --> 26:29.200
and then we start to believe in I and you.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
And is that, or are we,

26:31.200 --> 26:35.240
is that fundamental to the human brain machine?

26:35.240 --> 26:38.520
Yeah, I think it goes very deep.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.840
I think it's fundamental and I think it probably,

26:40.840 --> 26:43.280
some form of feeling like a self

26:43.280 --> 26:48.280
goes as deep as cats and dogs and it's possible.

26:48.560 --> 26:52.680
I mean, if consciousness does go down to the level of cells

26:52.680 --> 26:54.920
or however far down you wanna take it, worms,

26:54.920 --> 26:58.640
or I think any system that's navigating itself

26:58.640 --> 26:59.640
that kind of has boundaries

26:59.640 --> 27:02.640
and is navigating itself in the world,

27:04.240 --> 27:08.480
my guess is that it's an intrinsic part of,

27:08.480 --> 27:10.640
that's why I imagined that the p-tendril

27:10.640 --> 27:12.400
would have this feeling.

27:13.400 --> 27:18.400
And so, we use the word I,

27:18.400 --> 27:19.680
I think you're right, first of all,

27:19.680 --> 27:21.600
that the way we talk about things

27:21.600 --> 27:23.720
affects our intuitions about them

27:23.720 --> 27:24.840
and how we feel about them.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.560
And so there are other cultures who are more open

27:28.720 --> 27:32.360
to breaking through these illusions than others for sure,

27:32.360 --> 27:36.520
just because of their belief sets, the way they talk.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.760
I mean, I'm sure, I'm not a linguist

27:38.760 --> 27:40.960
and I don't even speak a second language,

27:40.960 --> 27:45.160
so I can't speak to it, but if there were a language

27:45.160 --> 27:50.160
that framed who we are differently in everyday language,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.720
I mean, in our everyday communication,

27:55.720 --> 27:57.600
I would think that would have an effect.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.960
Yeah, language does affect things.

27:58.960 --> 28:02.720
I mean, just knowing Russian and the history

28:02.720 --> 28:05.840
of the Soviet Union in the 20th century,

28:05.840 --> 28:08.840
obviously it lived under communism for a long time,

28:08.840 --> 28:12.360
so your conception of individualism is different

28:12.360 --> 28:14.960
and that reflects itself in the language.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.320
You could probably have a similar kind of thing

28:18.160 --> 28:22.000
within the language in terms of how we talk about I

28:22.000 --> 28:23.280
and we and so on.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.040
And I'm sure there's like certain countries

28:27.040 --> 28:29.400
or maybe even villages with certain dialects

28:29.400 --> 28:34.400
that let go of the individualism that's inherent.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.280
Yeah, I mean, there must be a range,

28:36.280 --> 28:38.760
but I do think that it's pretty deep.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.760
And I think there's also a difference

28:44.120 --> 28:46.800
between the autobiographical me

28:46.800 --> 28:50.720
and then this more fundamental me that we're talking about

28:50.720 --> 28:52.440
that I'm pointing to as the illusion.

28:52.440 --> 28:57.440
So in my book, I talk about if someone wakes up with amnesia,

28:58.440 --> 29:01.240
if they have a brain injury and suddenly have amnesia

29:01.240 --> 29:04.080
and can't remember anything about their lives,

29:04.080 --> 29:05.120
can't remember their name,

29:05.120 --> 29:07.800
don't recognize people they're related to,

29:10.920 --> 29:14.280
they would have lost their autobiographical self,

29:14.280 --> 29:16.360
but they would still feel like an I.

29:16.360 --> 29:20.520
They would still have that basic sense of I'm a person.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.160
I mean, they'd be speaking that way.

29:22.920 --> 29:23.760
I don't remember my name.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.040
I don't know where I live.

29:27.240 --> 29:32.240
It goes very deep, this feeling that I am a single entity

29:33.840 --> 29:38.720
that is somehow not completely reliant

29:38.720 --> 29:41.240
upon the cause and effect of the physical world.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.720
Can I ask you a pothead question?

29:42.720 --> 29:43.840
Yeah.

29:43.840 --> 29:48.840
Would you rather lose all your memories

29:49.640 --> 29:51.680
or not be able to make new ones?

29:53.680 --> 29:55.960
Now I'm asking you as a human

29:55.960 --> 29:57.840
in terms of happiness and preference.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.920
I can't answer that.

30:04.920 --> 30:05.760
You like both.

30:05.760 --> 30:09.440
You like both features of the organism that you embody?

30:09.440 --> 30:13.080
Well, one is intellectual and one is psychological, really.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.640
I mean, I would have to choose the memories only because,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.480
I mean, the memories of the body.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.520
Yeah.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.600
Only because I have children and a family

30:22.600 --> 30:25.840
and it wouldn't just be affecting me.

30:25.840 --> 30:26.680
It would be affecting them.

30:26.680 --> 30:28.600
It would just be too horrible.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.400
No, but you would make new ones, right?

30:31.400 --> 30:34.520
If I lost my memory of the 13 past 13 years.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.440
Oh, you think you would lose?

30:38.440 --> 30:39.640
This is a dark question.

30:39.640 --> 30:40.760
Oh, wait, wasn't that the question?

30:40.760 --> 30:41.600
Maybe I misunderstood.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.160
No, no, no, no, you understood it perfectly, but.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.000
Yeah.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.000
Sorry for the dark question,

30:47.000 --> 30:49.560
but the people you love in your life,

30:49.560 --> 30:52.760
if you lost all your memory of everything,

30:52.760 --> 30:55.000
do you think you would still love them?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.880
Like you show up, you don't know.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.720
I don't know.

30:57.720 --> 30:58.560
It's the role of the dead.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.960
I mean, it would not in the way that I do.

30:59.960 --> 31:00.800
Right.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.160
So some deep aspect of love

31:03.160 --> 31:04.720
is the history you have together.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.520
Oh, absolutely.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.600
Well, and this gets to an interesting point, actually,

31:07.600 --> 31:10.040
which I think a lot about, which is memory.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.640
And we won't go into this yet,

31:12.640 --> 31:14.040
but I'll just plant a flag here.

31:14.040 --> 31:14.880
I love the song.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.240
Memory is obviously related to time,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.200
and time is something that I'm fascinated with.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.800
And for this project I'm working on now,

31:23.800 --> 31:25.680
I've mostly been speaking to physicists

31:25.680 --> 31:28.280
who are interested in consciousness.

31:28.280 --> 31:30.920
And it's partly because of this link

31:30.920 --> 31:33.000
between memory and time,

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
and all of these new fascinating theories

31:39.880 --> 31:43.040
and thoughts around the different interpretations

31:43.040 --> 31:46.160
of quantum mechanics and looking at, you know,

31:46.160 --> 31:48.000
the thing that I've always been looking for

31:48.000 --> 31:50.440
is really the fundamental nature of reality

31:50.440 --> 31:55.440
and why my questions about consciousness

31:55.560 --> 31:57.880
lead me to wonder if consciousness

31:57.880 --> 32:01.160
is a more fundamental aspect of the universe

32:01.160 --> 32:02.760
than we previously thought,

32:02.760 --> 32:05.200
and certainly I previously thought.

32:06.760 --> 32:11.200
And so memory, but memory is tied to so many things.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.280
I mean, even basic functions in nature,

32:14.280 --> 32:17.440
actually, so the p-tendril, as I mentioned,

32:17.440 --> 32:20.640
memory comes into play there, and that's so fascinating.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.600
And there is no sense of self without memory,

32:25.600 --> 32:27.840
even if you're starting from scratch,

32:27.840 --> 32:29.480
as you said, with amnesia.

32:31.200 --> 32:35.200
If you truly couldn't lay down any new memories,

32:35.200 --> 32:37.320
I think you would, then that sense of self

32:37.320 --> 32:38.640
would begin to disintegrate,

32:38.640 --> 32:40.720
because the sense of self

32:40.720 --> 32:45.480
is one of a concrete entity through time.

32:45.480 --> 32:49.480
And if each moment, if you really were stuck

32:49.480 --> 32:51.560
in the present moment, eternally,

32:51.560 --> 32:53.560
you'd basically be meditating.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.680
And in meditation, this is a very common experience,

32:57.680 --> 33:01.200
is losing that sense of self, that sense of free will,

33:01.200 --> 33:06.200
that those illusions more easily drop away in meditation.

33:06.960 --> 33:10.120
And I would say for most people who meditate long enough,

33:10.120 --> 33:11.040
they do drop away.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.240
And there's actually an explanation

33:12.240 --> 33:14.240
at the level of the brain as well.

33:14.240 --> 33:17.960
The default mode network is circuitry in the brain

33:17.960 --> 33:20.520
that neuroscientists don't completely understand,

33:20.520 --> 33:23.320
but know is largely responsible

33:23.320 --> 33:25.600
for this feeling of being a self.

33:25.600 --> 33:29.680
And when that circuit gets quieted down,

33:29.680 --> 33:31.000
which it does in meditation,

33:31.000 --> 33:34.840
and also does with the use of psychedelic drugs,

33:35.800 --> 33:37.680
and there are other ways to quiet down

33:37.680 --> 33:39.000
the default mode network,

33:40.160 --> 33:45.160
people have this experience of losing this illusion

33:45.280 --> 33:46.120
of being a self.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.560
They no longer feel that they're a self

33:47.560 --> 33:49.520
in the way that they usually do.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.440
So there's the autobiographical self

33:52.440 --> 33:56.640
is connected to the sense of self.

33:56.640 --> 33:57.480
Oh, absolutely.

33:57.480 --> 33:58.520
Through the memory.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.600
And then you're thinking that the solution to that

34:01.600 --> 34:03.920
lies in physics, not just neuroscience.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.440
Like ultimately, consciousness

34:07.440 --> 34:09.880
and the experience, the conscious will

34:10.800 --> 34:13.720
is a question of physics.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.200
I may have said something misleading

34:16.200 --> 34:18.200
because I was connecting too many dots.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.280
Half the things I say are misleading.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.000
Let us mislead each other.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.280
I just got excited when memory came up

34:26.280 --> 34:29.000
because I love talking about time.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.560
So you mentioned a project you're working on

34:30.560 --> 34:31.400
a couple of times.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.880
What's that about?

34:32.880 --> 34:34.560
I think you said Ted is involved.

34:34.560 --> 34:35.880
You're interviewing a bunch of people.

34:35.880 --> 34:36.720
What's going on?

34:36.720 --> 34:37.560
What's the topic?

34:38.560 --> 34:43.080
So I'm working on an audio documentary about consciousness

34:43.080 --> 34:45.480
and it picks up where my book left off.

34:46.360 --> 34:49.520
So all of the questions that were still lingering for me

34:49.520 --> 34:52.440
and research that I still wanted to do,

34:52.440 --> 34:53.600
I just started conducting.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.480
So I've done about 30 interviews so far

34:56.480 --> 35:00.080
and it's not totally clear what the end result will be.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.720
I'm currently collaborating with Ted

35:03.560 --> 35:06.560
and I'm having a lot of fun creating a pilot with them.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.640
And so we'll see where it goes,

35:08.640 --> 35:11.840
but the idea is that it's a narrated documentary.

35:11.840 --> 35:12.880
It's like a series.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.680
A series, it'll be a 10 part series.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.600
It's an unclear, oh, you already know the number of parts.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.440
Sorry, in my mind, it's a 10 part series.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.440
It may end up being eight or 11 or 12.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.280
I don't know why.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.960
Listen, I am very comforted by the numbers zero and one

35:24.960 --> 35:25.800
as well.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.640
About 10.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.080
I like the confidence of 10.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.440
So, and you're not sure what the title,

35:33.040 --> 35:35.200
but the topic, will there be consciousness

35:35.200 --> 35:37.040
or something bigger or something smaller?

35:37.040 --> 35:39.080
Yeah, I mean, it's my, so at the end of my book,

35:39.080 --> 35:43.160
I kind of get to the place where I've convinced myself

35:43.160 --> 35:46.040
at least that this question about whether consciousness

35:46.040 --> 35:48.320
is fundamental is a legitimate one.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.800
And then I just start spending a lot of time

35:51.800 --> 35:53.680
thinking about what that would mean,

35:53.680 --> 35:57.200
if it's even possible to study scientifically.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.960
So I mostly talk to physicists actually,

35:59.960 --> 36:02.160
because I really think ultimately,

36:02.160 --> 36:04.920
this is a question for physics,

36:04.920 --> 36:06.200
if consciousness is fundamental.

36:06.200 --> 36:09.000
I think it needs to be strongly informed by neuroscience,

36:09.000 --> 36:13.920
but it's, yeah, if it's part of the fabric of reality,

36:13.920 --> 36:15.440
it is a question for a physicist.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.640
So I speak to different physicists

36:17.640 --> 36:20.240
about different interpretations of quantum mechanics.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.920
So getting at the fundamentals.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.320
So string theory in many worlds, I spoke to Sean Carroll,

36:25.320 --> 36:27.000
had a great conversation with Sean Carroll.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.560
He's so generous because he clearly doesn't agree with me

36:29.560 --> 36:34.240
about many things, but he has a curious mind

36:34.240 --> 36:35.960
and he's willing to have these conversations.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.720
And I was really interested

36:37.720 --> 36:39.560
in understanding many worlds better.

36:39.560 --> 36:42.040
And if consciousness is fundamental,

36:42.040 --> 36:43.600
what the implications are.

36:44.520 --> 36:47.360
So that was where I started actually was with many worlds.

36:47.360 --> 36:51.120
And then we had conversations about string theory

36:51.120 --> 36:54.080
and the holographic principle.

36:54.080 --> 36:59.080
I spoke to Lee Smolin and Brian Greene and Jana Levin

36:59.640 --> 37:00.800
and Carlo Rovelli actually.

37:00.800 --> 37:01.800
Have you had Carlo on?

37:01.800 --> 37:02.640
No, no.

37:02.640 --> 37:05.040
Okay, he's great also and fun to talk to

37:05.040 --> 37:07.640
because he's just endlessly curious, yeah.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.120
And you're doing audio.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.200
It's all audio, yeah.

37:10.200 --> 37:11.640
But it's in the format of a documentary.

37:11.640 --> 37:14.440
So I'm narrating it and kind of telling the story

37:14.440 --> 37:16.400
of what questions came up for me,

37:16.400 --> 37:17.880
what I was interested in exploring,

37:17.880 --> 37:21.480
and then why I talk to each person I talk to.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.960
By the way, I highly recommend Sean Carroll's Mindscape

37:24.960 --> 37:26.080
podcast, I think it's called.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.360
Yeah.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.200
It's amazing.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.240
It's one of my favorite things.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.840
When he interviews physicists, it's great,

37:30.840 --> 37:32.520
but any topic, his aim is.

37:32.520 --> 37:35.760
But one of my favorite things is how frustrated

37:35.760 --> 37:37.240
he gets with panpsychism.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.120
But he's still like, it's like a fly towards the light.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.440
For some reason, he can't make sense of it,

37:44.440 --> 37:46.240
but he still struggles with it.

37:46.240 --> 37:50.680
And I think that's the sign of a good scientist

37:50.680 --> 37:53.240
who is struggling with these ideas.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.240
I totally agree.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.800
And yes, that's what I appreciate in him

37:57.040 --> 37:59.400
and many scientists like that.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.080
Who has the craziest, most radical ideas

38:02.080 --> 38:03.920
that you talk with currently?

38:03.920 --> 38:06.000
So you can go either direction.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.760
You can go like panpsychism,

38:07.760 --> 38:10.240
consciousness permeates everything.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.600
Yeah.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.560
I don't know how far you can go down that direction.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.520
Or you could say that, you know,

38:17.520 --> 38:19.760
what would be the other direction?

38:19.760 --> 38:20.600
That there's a-

38:20.600 --> 38:22.720
There isn't really, the problem is they're all crazy.

38:22.720 --> 38:23.560
They're all crazy.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.400
Each one is crazier than the next.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.240
All of us are crazy.

38:26.240 --> 38:27.760
And my own thoughts now,

38:27.760 --> 38:32.760
I have to be very careful about the words I choose

38:33.680 --> 38:37.840
because I mean, it's just like talking about

38:38.800 --> 38:41.080
the different interpretations of quantum mechanics.

38:41.080 --> 38:46.080
It's once you get deep enough, it's so counterintuitive

38:46.360 --> 38:49.000
and it's so beyond anything we understand

38:49.000 --> 38:51.080
that they all sound crazy.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.080
Many worlds sounds crazy, string theory.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.880
I mean, these are things we just cannot get

38:54.880 --> 38:57.080
our minds around really.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.640
And so that's kind of,

38:58.640 --> 39:03.360
that's the realm I love to live in and love to explore in.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.000
And the realm that to my surprise,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.720
my interesting consciousness has taken me back to.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.000
Can I ask you a question on that?

39:10.000 --> 39:10.840
Yeah.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.560
Just a side tangent.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.920
How do you prevent when you're imagining yourself

39:14.920 --> 39:16.840
to be a pitendril,

39:16.840 --> 39:18.640
how do you prevent from going crazy?

39:18.640 --> 39:21.560
I mean, this is kind of the Nietzsche question of like,

39:21.560 --> 39:23.440
you have to be very careful

39:23.440 --> 39:27.560
thinking outside the norms of society

39:27.560 --> 39:28.880
because you might fall off.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.760
Like mentally, you're so connected as a human

39:31.760 --> 39:34.080
to the collective intelligence

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
that in order to question intuitions,

39:36.080 --> 39:40.080
you have to step outside of it for a brief moment.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.840
How do you prevent yourself from going crazy?

39:42.840 --> 39:47.840
I think I used to think that was a concern.

39:48.040 --> 39:48.880
And then you became crazy.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.480
I've learned so much about the brain.

39:50.480 --> 39:54.080
No, and I've had experiences of deep depression

39:54.080 --> 39:56.280
and I struggled with anxiety my whole life.

39:57.360 --> 40:01.840
I think in order to be a good scientist

40:01.840 --> 40:06.600
and in order to be a truthfully,

40:06.600 --> 40:11.320
let's say to allow yourself to be curious

40:11.320 --> 40:13.800
and honest in your curiosity,

40:13.800 --> 40:17.620
I think it's inevitable that lots of ideas

40:17.620 --> 40:20.320
and theories and hypotheses

40:21.160 --> 40:22.800
will just sound crazy.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.640
And that is always how we've advanced science.

40:26.640 --> 40:29.640
And maybe nine out of 10 ideas are crazy

40:29.640 --> 40:33.680
and crazy meaning they're actually not correct.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.480
But all of, I mean, as I said,

40:37.480 --> 40:39.760
all of the big scientific breakthroughs,

40:39.760 --> 40:41.880
all of the truths we've uncovered

40:41.880 --> 40:46.880
that are the earth shattering truths that we uncover,

40:47.640 --> 40:49.840
they really do sound crazy at first.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.320
So I don't think one necessarily leads

40:52.320 --> 40:54.480
to a type of mental illness.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.560
I see mental illness in a very different category.

40:57.560 --> 41:02.360
And I think some people are more susceptible

41:02.360 --> 41:06.040
to being destabilized by this type of thinking.

41:06.040 --> 41:09.120
And that might be a legitimate concern for some people

41:09.120 --> 41:12.920
that kind of being grounded in everyday life is important.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.320
For my psychological health,

41:15.320 --> 41:19.160
the more time I spend thinking about the bigger picture

41:19.160 --> 41:22.800
and outside of everyday life,

41:22.800 --> 41:27.800
the more happy I am, the more expansive I feel.

41:29.240 --> 41:31.680
I mean, it feels nourishing to me.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.320
It feels like it makes me more sane, not less.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.880
Well, that's a happiness,

41:35.880 --> 41:38.560
but in terms of your ability to see the truth,

41:39.520 --> 41:42.120
you can be happy and completely be-

41:42.120 --> 41:43.760
I guess I don't see mental illness

41:43.760 --> 41:47.440
necessarily being linked to truth or not truth.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.040
So we were talking about minimizing mental illness,

41:51.040 --> 41:54.680
but also truth is a different dimension.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.280
So you have to, you can go crazy in both directions.

41:57.280 --> 42:01.680
You can, like, you could be extremely happy,

42:01.680 --> 42:05.040
and they are, flat earthers.

42:05.040 --> 42:07.080
You can believe the earth is flat,

42:07.080 --> 42:09.320
because actually, I mean,

42:09.320 --> 42:10.560
I'm sure there's good books on this,

42:10.560 --> 42:12.760
but it's somehow really comforting.

42:12.760 --> 42:16.800
It's fun and comforting to believe you've figured out

42:16.840 --> 42:19.440
the thing that everybody else hasn't figured out.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.800
I think that's what conspiracy theories

42:21.800 --> 42:23.160
always provide people.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.560
Why is it so fun?

42:24.560 --> 42:28.120
It's so fun, except when it's dangerous.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.240
But even then, it's probably fun,

42:31.240 --> 42:33.720
but then you shouldn't do it because it's unethical.

42:34.760 --> 42:35.680
Anyway, so- That's not true.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.440
I'm not a fan of following.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.320
Well, that makes one of us.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.200
I don't know.

42:42.200 --> 42:44.040
There is probably a fascinating story

42:44.040 --> 42:49.040
to why conspiracy theories are so compelling to us human beings

42:49.480 --> 42:53.360
as deeper than just fun internet stuff.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.200
Yeah.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.040
I'm very interested in why they're so compelling

42:56.040 --> 42:57.560
to some people and not others.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.400
I feel like there must be some difference

42:59.400 --> 43:03.320
that at some point we'll be able to discover.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.800
Yeah, yeah.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.160
Because some people are just not susceptible to them,

43:08.160 --> 43:09.320
and some people are-

43:09.320 --> 43:10.880
And I wonder what's the correlation-

43:10.880 --> 43:11.720
Really drawn to them.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.760
Because I feel like the kind of thinking

43:13.760 --> 43:18.680
that allows for you to be open to conspiracy theories

43:18.680 --> 43:20.840
is also the kind of thinking that leads

43:20.840 --> 43:23.440
to brilliant breakthroughs in science.

43:24.320 --> 43:27.800
Sort of willingness to go to crazy land,

43:27.800 --> 43:28.640
something that seems like crazy land.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.480
That's interesting.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.760
I see it the opposite way.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.600
Really?

43:31.600 --> 43:32.440
Yeah.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.800
See, you don't see the connection

43:35.800 --> 43:38.560
between thinking the earth is flat

43:38.560 --> 43:40.800
and coming up with special relativity.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.400
Thinking the earth is flat is following your intuitions

43:44.400 --> 43:49.400
and not being open to counterintuitive ideas.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.040
It's a very closed way of viewing things.

43:53.040 --> 43:54.880
Saying it's actually, it's not the way you feel.

43:54.880 --> 43:58.040
There's information that tells us

43:58.040 --> 43:59.360
there's something else going on.

43:59.360 --> 44:01.640
And that type of person will say,

44:01.640 --> 44:04.640
no, it's the way it feels to me.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.480
No, no, no.

44:05.480 --> 44:06.300
But wait a minute.

44:06.300 --> 44:09.720
There's a mainstream narrative of science

44:09.720 --> 44:11.720
that says the earth is round.

44:11.720 --> 44:12.560
Right.

44:12.560 --> 44:16.480
Like, and I think a flat earth are in the,

44:16.480 --> 44:19.640
see, I admire the very first step of a flat earth.

44:19.640 --> 44:22.280
I don't admire the full journey,

44:22.280 --> 44:23.760
but the first step is.

44:23.760 --> 44:25.400
Think if you're open to evidence,

44:25.400 --> 44:28.320
then the evidence clearly takes you in one direction.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.560
Right, but you have to ask the question.

44:30.560 --> 44:33.240
You have to ask, to me,

44:33.240 --> 44:35.160
this is like first principles thinking.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.000
Yeah.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.680
The earth looks flat,

44:37.680 --> 44:40.160
so I'm gonna look around here.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.620
And I, like,

44:43.340 --> 44:46.960
how crazy is it that the earth is round

44:46.960 --> 44:49.000
and there's a thing called gravity

44:49.000 --> 44:51.400
that operates between objects

44:51.400 --> 44:54.760
that's related to the mass of the object?

44:54.760 --> 44:55.600
Right.

44:55.600 --> 44:56.420
That's crazy.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.040
Yes, the truth is often crazier

44:58.040 --> 45:00.400
than what the situation feels to be.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.920
A good step is to question what everyone is saying

45:02.920 --> 45:04.160
and then you learn a little bit.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.000
I know what you mean,

45:05.000 --> 45:06.360
to be skeptical about the,

45:06.360 --> 45:07.480
it's the authority.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.080
Yeah, but I think that and the authority

45:10.080 --> 45:13.840
in not in some kind of weird current

45:13.840 --> 45:15.400
where everyone questions institutions,

45:15.400 --> 45:18.760
but more like the authority of the senior scientists,

45:18.760 --> 45:20.480
the junior scientists coming up,

45:20.480 --> 45:23.100
wait a minute, why have we been doing things this way?

45:23.100 --> 45:24.400
And that first step,

45:24.400 --> 45:27.760
I feel like that rebelliousness

45:27.760 --> 45:29.160
or that open-mindedness

45:29.160 --> 45:32.280
or maybe like resistance to,

45:32.280 --> 45:34.180
or maybe curiosity that's,

45:34.860 --> 45:38.300
that is not affected

45:38.300 --> 45:41.420
by whatever the mainstream science says of today.

45:41.420 --> 45:44.420
Yes, I feel like mainstream science

45:44.420 --> 45:45.820
has never been mainstream

45:45.820 --> 45:47.580
and it's always a struggle for science

45:47.580 --> 45:48.820
to become mainstream.

45:48.820 --> 45:50.660
It's part of the reason why I started doing the work

45:50.660 --> 45:52.700
I did actually helping scientists

45:52.700 --> 45:54.260
make their work more accessible

45:54.260 --> 45:57.460
is that it's usually not.

45:57.460 --> 45:58.300
Yeah.

45:58.300 --> 45:59.120
It's usually not.

45:59.120 --> 46:00.380
Here's advice for scientists,

46:00.380 --> 46:01.980
be more interesting

46:01.980 --> 46:05.220
and much more important, be less arrogant.

46:05.220 --> 46:09.820
So arrogance, there's very little money in science

46:09.820 --> 46:11.500
and so everyone is fighting for that money

46:11.500 --> 46:13.500
and they become more and more arrogant and siloed.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.540
I don't know why.

46:14.540 --> 46:17.380
I will say that the scientists I know

46:17.380 --> 46:19.100
and some of them are very well-known,

46:19.100 --> 46:20.340
very famous scientists

46:20.340 --> 46:22.780
are the least arrogant people I've ever met.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.840
That scientists in general,

46:25.740 --> 46:30.740
their personalities are more open, more humble,

46:31.020 --> 46:33.900
more likely to say they just don't know

46:34.780 --> 46:38.780
because I've been involved a lot in the science writing

46:38.780 --> 46:40.780
and how the media portrays.

46:40.780 --> 46:43.700
So one of scientists,

46:43.700 --> 46:47.780
the scientific community's greatest frustration

46:47.780 --> 46:50.580
is how their work gets presented in the media.

46:50.580 --> 46:52.940
And a lot of the time that is,

46:52.940 --> 46:54.900
I would say that's the main frustration

46:54.900 --> 46:57.660
is there's some new breakthrough, there's something.

46:57.660 --> 46:59.220
And the scientists will be saying,

46:59.260 --> 47:02.220
we're not sure, it's gonna take five years.

47:02.220 --> 47:05.020
And no one likes to write a story about something

47:05.020 --> 47:06.180
that may or may not be true.

47:06.180 --> 47:07.300
They think it's true,

47:07.300 --> 47:08.980
they're gonna take five years testing it.

47:08.980 --> 47:13.980
And so the headline will be neuroscientists discovered,

47:14.380 --> 47:15.620
they want this sensational.

47:15.620 --> 47:20.620
And so I think the public often gets the false impression

47:21.140 --> 47:23.580
that the scientists are arrogant

47:23.580 --> 47:27.140
and I really don't find that to be the case.

47:27.140 --> 47:30.660
And I've worked with all kinds of people, artists,

47:30.660 --> 47:35.660
and my life path has taken a strange.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.140
You've met some incredible people,

47:38.140 --> 47:40.380
you work with some incredible people.

47:40.380 --> 47:44.260
So let's, the crazy topic of free will,

47:44.260 --> 47:46.180
I mean, I just, we have to link on this

47:46.180 --> 47:47.020
because I can't.

47:48.940 --> 47:50.260
So the plant, all right,

47:50.260 --> 47:52.820
can you try to steal man the case

47:52.820 --> 47:55.420
that there's something really special about humans?

47:56.420 --> 47:58.100
That there is a fundamental difference

47:58.100 --> 48:01.620
between us and the pthandril.

48:01.620 --> 48:04.900
You know, humans are clearly very special

48:04.900 --> 48:08.020
in the evolution of organisms on earth.

48:08.020 --> 48:08.860
Absolutely, yeah.

48:08.860 --> 48:11.860
Could that have been the magic leap?

48:11.860 --> 48:15.460
Could consciousness been like the invention

48:15.460 --> 48:18.860
of the eukaryotic cell or something like this?

48:18.860 --> 48:20.540
Well then, I mean, so I have to get clear

48:20.540 --> 48:21.380
on what you're asking.

48:21.380 --> 48:26.380
So are you coming from a place of wondering

48:26.460 --> 48:29.220
if we are the only conscious mammals?

48:29.220 --> 48:30.660
Yes.

48:30.660 --> 48:33.540
Do you really think that's a question?

48:33.540 --> 48:34.860
Can you make a case for it?

48:34.860 --> 48:38.260
Do you really think that's a question?

48:38.260 --> 48:39.180
Take one step back.

48:39.180 --> 48:40.740
We look out at the universe.

48:43.700 --> 48:46.420
At this point in our scientific understanding,

48:46.420 --> 48:48.740
we know that essentially we're all made

48:48.740 --> 48:50.140
of the same ingredients, right?

48:50.140 --> 48:54.180
They're atoms in the universe doing their thing.

48:54.180 --> 48:57.340
They find themselves in different configurations

48:57.340 --> 48:58.820
based on the laws of physics.

49:00.420 --> 49:03.100
And then the question is if we look out

49:03.100 --> 49:05.700
at all of the configurations of atoms in the universe

49:05.700 --> 49:10.220
and ask which of these entail conscious experiences?

49:10.220 --> 49:12.260
Which of these have a felt experience

49:12.260 --> 49:14.300
of being the matter they are?

49:15.100 --> 49:18.780
And they're really only to, broadly speaking,

49:18.780 --> 49:22.980
they're really only to assumptions to make here.

49:22.980 --> 49:27.140
And the first one is the one that science has taken

49:27.140 --> 49:29.700
and that I have for most of my career as well.

49:29.700 --> 49:32.060
And that in many ways makes the most sense,

49:32.060 --> 49:35.060
which is electrons aren't conscious,

49:35.060 --> 49:37.220
tables aren't, there's no felt experience there.

49:37.220 --> 49:39.900
But at a certain point in complex processing,

49:41.100 --> 49:43.260
that processing entails an experience

49:43.260 --> 49:44.620
of being that processing.

49:44.620 --> 49:47.420
Now that's just a fascinating fact all on its own.

49:47.420 --> 49:49.460
And I love to spend time thinking about that.

49:49.460 --> 49:52.860
But so the question is, does consciousness arise

49:52.860 --> 49:55.380
at some point, are some of these collections

49:55.380 --> 49:59.500
of atoms conscious or are all of them?

49:59.500 --> 50:01.300
Because we know the answer isn't none.

50:01.300 --> 50:04.300
I know that I'm at least having a conscious experience.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.380
I know that conscious experiences exist in the universe.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.020
And so the answer isn't none.

50:11.020 --> 50:14.620
So the answer has to be all or some.

50:14.660 --> 50:17.940
And this is a starting assumption

50:17.940 --> 50:20.620
that you're really kind of forced to make

50:20.620 --> 50:23.180
and that it's all or some.

50:23.180 --> 50:24.180
All or some or one?

50:24.180 --> 50:26.180
I would say one is some also.

50:26.180 --> 50:27.500
We either need an explanation

50:27.500 --> 50:30.140
for why there's non-conscious matter in the universe

50:30.140 --> 50:32.300
and then something happens for consciousness

50:32.300 --> 50:33.740
to come into being,

50:33.740 --> 50:37.420
or it's part of the fundamental nature of reality.

50:37.420 --> 50:42.300
It's also, if consciousness is a fundamental property

50:42.300 --> 50:45.740
of reality, it could also choose to not reveal itself

50:45.740 --> 50:48.060
until a certain complexity of organism.

50:49.340 --> 50:51.340
I'm not sure what that means.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.940
I'm not sure what that means either.

50:52.940 --> 50:56.940
Like the flame of consciousness does not start burning

50:56.940 --> 51:01.740
until a certain complexity of organism

51:01.740 --> 51:02.580
is able to reveal it.

51:02.580 --> 51:04.300
So I don't think we can look at consciousness that way.

51:04.300 --> 51:07.660
I don't think, I mean, many people like to try

51:07.660 --> 51:09.420
to make that argument that it's a spectrum.

51:09.420 --> 51:12.260
Why do we have to say all or nothing maybe?

51:13.220 --> 51:15.940
And I agree that I actually think it is a spectrum,

51:15.940 --> 51:17.980
but it's a spectrum of content,

51:17.980 --> 51:19.260
not of consciousness itself.

51:19.260 --> 51:23.940
So if a worm has some level of conscious experience,

51:23.940 --> 51:25.540
it is extremely minimal,

51:25.540 --> 51:28.020
something we could never imagine

51:28.020 --> 51:31.300
having the complex experience you and I have.

51:31.300 --> 51:35.180
Maybe some felt sensation of pressure or heat

51:35.180 --> 51:37.020
or something super basic, right?

51:37.020 --> 51:38.540
So there's this range,

51:38.540 --> 51:40.180
or even if you just think of an infant,

51:40.220 --> 51:42.900
like the first, the moment an infant becomes conscious,

51:42.900 --> 51:45.740
what that, there's a very, very minimal experience

51:45.740 --> 51:48.940
of inputs of sound and light and whatever it is.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.500
And so there's a spectrum of content.

51:51.500 --> 51:55.620
There's a spectrum of how much a system

51:55.620 --> 51:57.700
is consciously experiencing,

51:57.700 --> 52:01.700
but there's a moment at which you get on the spectrum.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.620
And that's, and I truly believe

52:03.620 --> 52:05.340
that that piece of it is binary.

52:05.340 --> 52:08.900
So if there's no conscious experience,

52:08.900 --> 52:10.180
there is no consciousness.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.420
You can't say consciousness is there,

52:11.420 --> 52:13.020
it just hasn't lit its flame yet.

52:13.020 --> 52:14.020
If consciousness is there,

52:14.020 --> 52:16.020
there's an experience there by definition.

52:16.020 --> 52:17.700
It has to arise at some point,

52:17.700 --> 52:18.940
or it has to always be there.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.660
Is it possible to make the case

52:21.660 --> 52:26.660
that that arising happens first,

52:26.820 --> 52:30.500
for the first time ever with Homo sapiens?

52:30.500 --> 52:33.220
I think that is extremely unlikely.

52:33.220 --> 52:37.060
What I think is more possible

52:37.060 --> 52:39.780
based on what we understand about the brain

52:39.780 --> 52:44.780
is that it arises in brains or nervous systems.

52:48.460 --> 52:51.780
And so then we're talking about flies

52:51.780 --> 52:53.140
and bees and all kinds of things

52:53.140 --> 52:57.420
that kind of fall out of our intuitions

52:57.420 --> 52:59.100
for whether they could be conscious or not.

52:59.100 --> 53:03.380
But I think especially once you talk

53:03.380 --> 53:07.780
about more complex brains with many, many more neurons,

53:07.780 --> 53:10.580
when you're talking about cats and dogs and dolphins,

53:11.660 --> 53:16.660
it's very hard to see how there would be a difference

53:17.580 --> 53:21.220
between humans and other mammals in terms of consciousness.

53:21.220 --> 53:24.140
Was there a difference in terms of intelligence

53:24.140 --> 53:26.180
between humans and other mammals?

53:26.180 --> 53:27.020
Sure.

53:27.020 --> 53:29.180
Not like a fundamental leap in intelligence.

53:29.180 --> 53:30.980
It's hard to say definitively.

53:30.980 --> 53:35.980
I mean, it depends on how you define intelligence

53:36.020 --> 53:37.140
and all kinds of things.

53:37.140 --> 53:39.700
But obviously humans are unique and capable

53:39.700 --> 53:40.820
of all kinds of things

53:40.820 --> 53:43.300
that no other mammals are capable of.

53:43.300 --> 53:45.660
And there are important differences.

53:45.660 --> 53:50.180
And I don't think you need any magical intervention

53:50.180 --> 53:53.620
of something outside of the physical world to explain it.

53:53.620 --> 53:56.580
And the way I think about consciousness,

53:56.580 --> 53:58.900
I actually think it's part of the reason

53:58.900 --> 54:00.660
we're mistaken about consciousness

54:01.620 --> 54:05.500
is because we are special in the ways that we're special

54:05.500 --> 54:08.460
and because we're complex creatures,

54:08.460 --> 54:10.380
we have these complex brains.

54:10.380 --> 54:12.580
So I think we should probably get into some of the details

54:12.580 --> 54:16.140
of why I think we're confused about what consciousness is.

54:16.140 --> 54:18.220
But just to finish this point,

54:19.220 --> 54:23.100
I think that we don't actually have any evidence

54:23.100 --> 54:26.660
that consciousness is complex,

54:26.660 --> 54:28.780
that it comes out of complex processing,

54:29.620 --> 54:31.620
that it's required for complex processing.

54:31.620 --> 54:36.300
And I think we've made this anthropomorphic mistake

54:36.300 --> 54:38.060
because we are conscious

54:38.060 --> 54:41.540
and it's very hard to get evidence.

54:41.540 --> 54:44.260
It's one of the things that makes consciousness unique

54:44.260 --> 54:46.180
and mysterious and why I'm fascinated with it

54:46.180 --> 54:48.540
is it's the one thing in nature

54:48.540 --> 54:52.380
that we can't get conclusive evidence of from the outside.

54:52.380 --> 54:53.860
We can buy analogy.

54:53.860 --> 54:57.180
You're behaving basically the same way I behave,

54:57.180 --> 54:58.820
more or less.

54:58.820 --> 55:00.700
You talk about your conscious experiences

55:00.700 --> 55:03.420
and therefore I just extrapolate from that,

55:03.420 --> 55:06.340
that you're having a felt experience in the way I am

55:06.340 --> 55:08.820
and we can do that throughout nature.

55:08.820 --> 55:09.940
Well, there's no physical evidence.

55:09.940 --> 55:11.580
There's nothing we can observe from the outside

55:11.580 --> 55:13.820
that will give us conclusive proof

55:13.820 --> 55:15.380
that consciousness is there.

55:15.380 --> 55:18.580
And so I think we've made this leap to

55:19.460 --> 55:22.580
because we're conscious and because we're unique

55:22.580 --> 55:27.300
and special and complex and intelligent

55:27.300 --> 55:29.260
in the way that we are

55:29.260 --> 55:32.660
and because we don't have an intuition

55:32.660 --> 55:34.700
that anything else is conscious

55:34.700 --> 55:37.380
or we have no feedback about it,

55:37.380 --> 55:41.140
we've made this assumption that consciousness,

55:41.140 --> 55:42.940
that those things aren't conscious

55:42.940 --> 55:45.740
and felt experience does not exist out there

55:45.740 --> 55:49.300
in other atoms and forms of life even,

55:49.300 --> 55:51.180
but especially not inanimate objects.

55:52.660 --> 55:57.660
And therefore consciousness is somehow tied

55:58.060 --> 56:01.380
to these other things that make us unique,

56:01.380 --> 56:05.740
that consciousness arises

56:05.740 --> 56:07.980
when there is this complex processing,

56:07.980 --> 56:09.540
when there is, and there's,

56:09.540 --> 56:11.140
we can talk about the evolution argument too,

56:11.140 --> 56:12.780
which I think is super interesting to get into

56:12.780 --> 56:15.060
and I'm hoping to talk to Richard Dawkins

56:15.060 --> 56:15.900
about this for my series.

56:15.900 --> 56:18.020
What's he think about consciousness?

56:18.020 --> 56:19.340
He's not interested.

56:20.620 --> 56:22.380
He's not interested in actually the conversation

56:22.380 --> 56:23.820
about how with him would be very brief

56:23.820 --> 56:26.740
because he's just not that interested in this topic,

56:26.740 --> 56:29.100
but let's go back to the Richard Dawkins piece

56:29.100 --> 56:31.020
because I feel like there's a lot to talk about here

56:31.020 --> 56:33.340
in terms of our intuitions about consciousness,

56:33.340 --> 56:35.940
what it's doing, why in my book

56:35.940 --> 56:38.540
and everywhere I talk about consciousness,

56:38.540 --> 56:40.740
I bring it back to these two questions

56:40.740 --> 56:42.700
that I think are at the heart of our intuitions

56:42.700 --> 56:43.540
about consciousness.

56:43.540 --> 56:46.300
And so your questions about whether human beings

56:46.300 --> 56:48.780
are unique and special and all of that

56:48.780 --> 56:50.180
I think are interesting questions

56:50.180 --> 56:51.500
and something we could talk about.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.860
I see them as separate questions

56:53.860 --> 56:55.620
from the consciousness question.

56:55.620 --> 56:59.460
So you see consciousness as giving a felt experience

56:59.460 --> 57:02.020
to our uniqueness as opposed to the uniqueness

57:02.020 --> 57:03.180
giving birth to consciousness.

57:03.180 --> 57:06.740
Yes, and that potentially there is felt experience

57:06.740 --> 57:08.340
even though it sounds crazy even to me

57:08.340 --> 57:12.300
that there is felt experience in all matter.

57:12.300 --> 57:14.340
And at this point in my thinking

57:14.340 --> 57:16.660
and after a few conversations with some physicists,

57:16.660 --> 57:19.300
I think if consciousness is fundamental,

57:19.300 --> 57:21.180
the only thing that actually makes sense

57:21.180 --> 57:25.100
is that it is part of the most fundamental

57:26.420 --> 57:30.020
that space time and everything else emerges out of.

57:30.020 --> 57:30.860
Out of consciousness.

57:30.860 --> 57:35.020
Felt experience is just part of the fabric of reality.

57:35.020 --> 57:37.580
So is it possible to intuit this?

57:37.580 --> 57:40.340
Can we start by thinking about dogs and cats,

57:40.340 --> 57:43.260
go to the plants and then going all the way to matter

57:43.260 --> 57:45.140
or is this going to be like modern physics

57:45.140 --> 57:47.860
where it's just going to be impossible to even

57:47.860 --> 57:50.780
in the through our reason alone.

57:51.340 --> 57:52.900
Is there going to have to have tools of some kind?

57:52.900 --> 57:54.220
I think it'll be a little bit of both.

57:54.220 --> 57:57.180
I mean, I think the science has a very long way to go

57:57.180 --> 57:59.260
and the truth is I don't even think we can get

57:59.260 --> 58:02.060
to the science yet because we have to do this work

58:02.060 --> 58:04.620
and this is why I'm so passionate about this work.

58:05.740 --> 58:09.060
And it's really taking hold.

58:09.060 --> 58:12.660
I mean, there are neuroscientists and physicists

58:12.660 --> 58:16.300
interested in consciousness and kind of having gotten

58:16.300 --> 58:21.300
over the initial obstacle of wrestling

58:22.060 --> 58:25.140
with these intuitions so that it's now being talked

58:25.140 --> 58:28.380
about in a serious way, which was the first huge hurdle.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.060
But I think a lot more of that has to happen.

58:31.060 --> 58:35.780
A lot more of the intuition breaking

58:35.780 --> 58:38.020
from the science we already have.

58:38.020 --> 58:40.340
I mean, I think we almost need to catch our intuitions

58:40.340 --> 58:45.340
up to what we already know and then continue

58:45.340 --> 58:48.300
to break through these intuitions systematically

58:48.300 --> 58:51.500
so that we can really think more clearly about consciousness.

58:52.660 --> 58:56.180
There are a couple of scientists now working

58:56.180 --> 58:59.260
on theories of consciousness, which do go,

58:59.260 --> 59:01.020
they don't quite go to the fundamental level,

59:01.020 --> 59:04.780
but they go extremely deep so that something

59:04.780 --> 59:07.300
like an electron might be conscious under their theory.

59:07.300 --> 59:10.460
This is integrated information theory,

59:10.460 --> 59:14.100
IIT with Christophe Koch and Giulio Tononi.

59:15.340 --> 59:17.300
I've spoken to both of them.

59:17.300 --> 59:21.660
I spoke to Christophe Koch once or twice

59:21.660 --> 59:23.580
for this project I'm working on now.

59:24.700 --> 59:27.260
What they're working on is incredibly interesting to me

59:27.260 --> 59:28.980
and I think very important work.

59:30.620 --> 59:35.620
However, I think they are also really led

59:36.220 --> 59:40.020
by some false intuitions about self and free will.

59:40.020 --> 59:42.020
And I think that will be a limit to their work.

59:42.020 --> 59:44.420
So we can get into that, but-

59:44.460 --> 59:45.300
Let's go.

59:45.300 --> 59:46.140
We will, we will.

59:46.140 --> 59:47.500
Christophe Koch is awesome.

59:47.500 --> 59:48.340
Let me just complete my thought.

59:48.340 --> 59:49.180
Oh yeah, sorry.

59:49.180 --> 59:52.300
Which is that what they're working on,

59:52.300 --> 59:54.780
I think is the most important next step forward,

59:54.780 --> 59:57.420
which is just even being open to the fact

59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.260
that consciousness goes as deep as particles.

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.100
And being rigorous with it.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.900
But even their theory isn't going as deep

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.300
as I think we need to go.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.620
And it's hard to say how we could actually study

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.220
this scientifically, but that's part of the reason

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.980
why I'm such a supporter of IIT

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.460
and why I'm so interested in what they're doing,

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.980
even though I think they're wrong.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.820
Is because they're opening this path

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.540
and I think they're getting more people interested

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:27.540
and I think, yeah, it'll be, it's hard for me to imagine

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.100
what the science will actually look like.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:33.260
Okay, so your intuition or at least the direction

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.740
which you're pushing is that consciousness

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.380
is the only fundamental thing in the universe

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.780
that everything else, like time,

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.660
all those kinds of things emerge from that.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:51.660
I will say that what I believe at this point,

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:54.460
I've been saying 50-50 for a long time.

01:00:54.460 --> 01:00:58.980
I'd say now it's like 51-49 in terms of consciousness

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.020
being emergent versus fundamental.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:05.140
So I am not convinced of this at all.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.100
I'm not convinced that consciousness is fundamental.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.180
What I think is there are very good reasons

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.900
to think it could be.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:16.660
And essentially all of science up to this point

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:21.300
has been led by the other assumption,

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.820
by the first assumption that consciousness arises

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:25.820
at some point, namely in brains.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.740
And that's where all the science has gone.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:28.660
And I think that's wonderful.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:30.100
And I think it should keep on going.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:30.940
And I actually think that was

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.020
a more important place to start.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.140
But I think there's a possibility

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.580
that the correct assumption is that it's fundamental.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.100
And so that's the science I support.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.860
That's the thing I spend a lot of my time thinking about

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.500
and talking to scientists and philosophers about.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:49.260
And so I shouldn't give the idea

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.100
that I actually have crossed over

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.500
into believing this is the case,

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.780
but it's the assumption I follow in my work at this point.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.940
It's a possibility, an understudied possibility,

01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.500
so it deserves serious, rigorous attention.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:04.780
And there are good reasons to start

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.060
with that assumption versus the other

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:10.020
that I think we're just now starting to realize.

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.580
So just to clarify, when we're talking about consciousness,

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.900
we're talking about the hard problem of consciousness

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.500
that it feels like something to,

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.340
there's a subjective experience.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.140
If consciousness permeates all matter, it's fundamental,

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:31.660
is that going to be somehow,

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.020
is our current intuition about consciousness,

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.500
the very tiny subset of what consciousness actually is?

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.220
So we have our intuitions about personal experiences,

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.820
what it feels like, what it tastes to eat a cookie

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.020
or something like that.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:54.540
But that seems like a very specific implementation

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.820
of consciousness in an organism.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.860
So how can we even reason about something

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.820
if consciousness is fundamental?

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.260
How can we reason about that?

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.180
I'm not sure I'm understanding the connection

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.380
between those two things, but.

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.540
When you think about what it's like to be a plant,

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.300
to experience a thing, okay, we can kind of get that.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.500
We can kind of understand that.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.860
There are a lot of places we could go with this.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.380
One is there is actually work being done

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:20.860
by people like David Eagleman.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.860
He's a neuroscientist, I don't know if you know him.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:24.900
You should talk to him for your podcast if you haven't.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.820
He's wonderful, great science communicator.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.900
He's someone I interviewed for my current project too.

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.820
So he's done, this actually, okay,

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:34.020
there are many places we can go.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.740
One is he does work with sensory addition,

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:41.460
sensory substitution, and this is going

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.700
in some very interesting directions

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.300
and maybe partly answers your question,

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.300
which is giving humans qualia, sensory experiences

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.340
that we're not wired for,

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.940
that human beings have never had before.

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:58.420
You let me know what you're most interested in hearing about.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:02.140
We could talk about things like the brain port.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.500
There was actually a study done.

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.780
I just talked to one of the participants in the study

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.860
where they were seeing if they could give human beings

01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:10.820
an experience of magnetic north.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:15.580
So other animals have this sense that we don't have

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:18.980
where they can feel intuitively the way that our eyes work

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.020
to give us an intuitive sense of our environment.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:25.020
We don't have to translate the information coming in

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:25.860
through our eyes.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.140
We just have a map of the external world

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.220
and we can navigate it.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.980
So many animals use a sense of magnetic north

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:37.340
to get around and it's an intuitive sense.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.500
So I spoke to someone who was in this part

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:43.340
of this experiment and it was fascinating

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.340
to hear him acquire a sense not only that he had never had

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.220
but that no human being had ever had.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.660
So when I asked him to describe the experience,

01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.820
it was challenging for him and understandably so

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:59.380
because it would be like you describing sight

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.820
to someone who's never seen.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:05.060
But this is clearly possible and scientists

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:09.260
like David Eagleman and others are working on these.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:13.140
And so I do think it's possible that this line,

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:18.140
that these scientific advancements may actually start

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:23.940
to dovetail with the consciousness research

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:28.980
in terms of being able to experience things

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.060
we've never experienced before.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.340
But I do think that at some level,

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.540
yes, we're limited as human beings.

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.380
We may be able to find some proof or enough proof

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:45.380
to at least assume that consciousness is fundamental

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.140
or who knows one day actually believe

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.340
that that's the correct scientific view of things

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.900
and not really be able to get our minds around that

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.220
or to understand what it means

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:59.620
and certainly not to know what it feels like.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.460
I mean, we can't, we don't even know what it feels like

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.420
to be other creatures.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.460
I don't know what it's like to be you.

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:10.460
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what empathy is about.

01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.060
I mean, I guess that's what empathy is about.

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.660
That's what I tried to exercise is try to imagine

01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:17.300
what it's like to be other people.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:21.500
And then you're doing that even farther with potentials.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.360
But perhaps we can do that thing more rigorously

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.380
by connecting different sensory mechanisms to the brain

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.360
to do that for all kinds of organisms on earth.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.500
But they're similar to us in scale

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:36.860
and the time at which they function,

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.180
the time scale and the spatial scale,

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.700
perhaps it's much more difficult to do for electrons

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:42.540
and so on.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.620
Some of the intuitions I talked about,

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.500
I mean, I just kind of, I'm taking them for granted

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.620
that you and everyone knows what I'm talking about.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:54.620
But in terms of the science, in terms of the studies,

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:57.400
understanding things like binding processes,

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.620
understanding just a little bit about how the brain works

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:03.900
and as far as we understand,

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.520
and there's just a ton of evidence now to support

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.380
that our conscious experience is at the tail end

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:13.040
of a lot of brain processing.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:17.240
And so, yeah, so just a little bit,

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.400
I mean, I give in the example in my book,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:23.440
I talk about tennis and the binding of the sights

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.360
and sounds and felt experience of hitting a tennis ball,

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.760
which in the world are happening at different times,

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.760
the rates it takes, the sound waves and the light waves

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.320
and the felt sensation to travel to my brain are different,

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:43.320
that there are these binding processes that happen

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:47.160
prior to the conscious experience

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:50.960
that were essentially delivered to us by the brain.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.080
And so we can get back into this,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:57.180
I can answer your bigger question first,

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:01.500
but I feel like for a lot of people to understand

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:05.700
some of the science that already is shattering

01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.620
some of our intuitions about the role consciousness plays,

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.740
I think is helpful in terms of being able to be open

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.980
to thinking about these other ideas.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.060
Let's go there, where the heck does consciousness happen

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.620
in what we understand about the brain timing-wise?

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.860
I mean, this connects to conscious will too,

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.300
our experience of free will.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.340
Yeah, there is this period of time

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:33.180
and it's depending on the situation and the behavior,

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.840
it can be anywhere from, it's essentially half a second,

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.720
there's 200 milliseconds.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.500
I actually don't know, I was gonna compare it

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.020
to the timing of syncing film and sound,

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.860
I don't know if you know this data.

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.620
Yeah, unfortunately, I know this very well.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:47.460
You do?

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:48.860
The film and sound?

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.140
Yeah, like how the timing has to work

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:55.860
so that our experiences of it happening at the same time.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:09:00.140
Let me just sit in the silence of it.

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:03.340
There's been so much pain on this one point.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:06.380
I'm sorry, I had no idea I was.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.300
So, I mean, yeah, I did a lot of algorithms

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.020
on automatic synchronization of audio and video

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:16.220
and all these kinds of things, I know this well.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.460
There's a lot of science and there's a lot of differences,

01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:22.020
but it's about, and people claim,

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.060
it's about 100 milliseconds, you can't tell the difference,

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:27.780
but it's much more like 30 to 50 milliseconds.

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:31.420
And you can go nuts trying to see

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.380
if something is in sync or not.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.660
Is it in sync or not?

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:38.660
Well, also, your brain is constantly making adjustments

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.180
and so it can shift for you while you're doing that,

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.300
which is probably part of the thing

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.580
that's driving you crazy.

01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:47.900
Okay, so I'll start with binding processes

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.500
and then I'll just give a couple examples.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.420
So yes, there's this window where your brain

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:59.420
is essentially putting all of the information together

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.620
to deliver you a present moment experience

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.180
that is most useful for you to navigate the world.

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.140
So as I said, and I use this example of tennis in my book,

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.980
so the sights and sounds are coming at us

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:16.220
at different rates.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.900
It takes longer for a sensation in my hand

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:25.020
when I hit the ball with the racket to travel to my brain

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.740
than it does for the light waves to hit my retina

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.500
and get processed by the brain.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.780
So all these signals are coming in at different times.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.820
Our brains go through this process of binding

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:38.300
to basically weave it all together

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.580
so that our conscious experience of that

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:44.300
is of seeing, hearing, and feeling the ball

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.940
hit the racket all at the same time.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:49.220
That's obviously most useful to us.

01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:51.180
Binding is mostly about timing.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.420
It can be about other things,

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.340
but I was just talking to David Eagleman

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:57.100
who was talking about a very simple experiment actually,

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:00.820
and this kind of shows how your brain is basically

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.380
always interacting with the outside world

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:06.940
and always making adjustments to make its best guess

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:11.940
about the most useful present moment experience to deliver.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.460
So this is a very simple experiment.

01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.860
This is from many, many years ago,

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.660
and David Eagleman was involved in this research

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.180
where they had participants hit a button

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:25.180
and that button caused a flash of light.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:32.940
So our brains, through binding,

01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:37.940
the brain it notices is able to calibrate

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.260
the experience you have because the brain is aware

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:42.860
that it is its own hand

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:44.940
that is causing the light to flash,

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.700
that there's this cause and effect going on,

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:51.300
and so you have this experience of pushing the button

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.180
that causes the flash of light, which is true,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.380
and the light flashes.

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:58.980
You can start to introduce longer pauses

01:11:58.980 --> 01:12:01.860
starting with 20 milliseconds, 30 milliseconds,

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:05.580
going up to I think 100, maybe even 200 milliseconds,

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.740
where if you do it gradually,

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.860
since your brain is making the adjustment,

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.500
you can introduce a delay.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.780
I think it's up to 200 milliseconds.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:18.900
If you do it gradually, you will still have the experience,

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.620
even though there's now a delay between

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:22.940
when you hit the button and the light flashes,

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.340
you will still have the exact same experience you had

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:27.140
initially, which is that the light flashes

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:28.180
right when you push the button.

01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.220
In your experience, nothing is changing.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:35.940
But then, so they gradually give a delay.

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.540
You've acclimated to that because it was done gradually.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:43.940
If they then go back to the original instantaneous flash,

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.540
your brain doesn't have time to make the adjustment,

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:51.300
and you have the experience that the light flashed

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.540
before you hit the button.

01:12:52.540 --> 01:12:54.180
And that is your true experience.

01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.620
It's not like you're confused,

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.940
but that is your brain didn't have time

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.900
to make that adjustment.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.420
You think you're in the same environment.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.260
You're pushing the button.

01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.220
It makes the light flash.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.620
It's kind of calibrating all the time,

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.620
but then the participants are suddenly saying,

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.660
oh, wait, that was so weird.

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.700
The light flashed before I hit the button.

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:15.820
And so these types of-

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.660
That's crazy.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:21.660
They built a Rochambeau rock, paper, scissors computer game

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:27.420
that was unbeatable based on this glitch

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:30.500
that you can present in binding by training someone.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.620
If you introduce a delay slowly enough,

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.980
then the computer can get the information

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:39.500
before it responds,

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.860
but you still have the experience

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:44.620
that you're both throwing out your rock

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.740
or paper or scissors at the same time.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.740
But in actuality, the computer saw your choice

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.980
before it makes its choice.

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.660
And it's in this window of milliseconds

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.540
where you don't notice it.

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:00.700
So that starts to help you build up an intuition

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:03.980
that this conscious experience is an illusion

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.380
constructed by the brain after-

01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.260
Conscious will.

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.100
Conscious will.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.500
Yeah, and just in general that consciousness

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.300
is not the thing that we feel it is,

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.100
which is driving the behavior

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.580
that is actually at the tail end of it.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.500
And so a lot of decision-making processes,

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.340
and there are studies that are more controversial,

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.980
and I don't usually like to cite them,

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:27.380
although if you wanna talk about them, we can.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.980
They're super interesting and intuition-shattering,

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.140
but there are now studies specifically about free will

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:36.460
to see if there are markers at the level of the brain

01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:39.140
that can see what decision you're going to make

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:40.580
and when you make that decision.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:44.300
And I think the neuroscience inevitably

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.900
is just going to get better.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.620
And so part of the reason I'm so passionate about this,

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.580
I mean, there's the science and there's just the curiosity

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:55.460
that drives me of wanting to understand

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:56.620
how the universe works,

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:01.660
but I actually see a lot of the neuroscience presenting us

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:07.420
with truths that are going to be difficult for us to accept.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.060
And I actually think there are really positive ways

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.020
to view these truths that we're uncovering.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.420
And even though they can be initially kind of jarring

01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:21.860
and even destabilizing and creepy,

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:26.460
I think ultimately there's actually a lot,

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.420
it can have a positive effect on human psychology

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.580
and a whole range of things

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:34.940
that I and others have experienced

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:37.340
and that I think it's important for us to talk about

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:40.340
because you can't hide from the truth,

01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.780
especially in science, right?

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.780
Like it just, it will reveal itself.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:48.660
And if this is true, I think not only

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.580
for better understanding the universe and nature,

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.260
which is kind of my primary passion,

01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:59.460
it's important for us to absorb these facts

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.900
and realize that they don't,

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:07.140
it doesn't necessarily take away

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.460
the things from us that we fear.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:12.340
I've heard people say, as we talked about,

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.780
it's a common point to make or question to ask a scientist,

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:18.700
can you still enjoy chocolate

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:20.540
if you're a molecular biologist

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.740
and is it a molecular biologist

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.060
that would be the one who would understand

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:26.620
how we experience chocolate?

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:28.500
I may have the wrong science.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.260
Yeah, but the point stands.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.500
If you're focused on the details

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.460
of the underlying nature of reality,

01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:39.940
does that take the joy and the pleasure

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:44.140
and for lack of a better word, spirituality

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.140
out of our experience as human beings?

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.820
And I actually think for these illusions

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.100
like free will and self, the reverse is true.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.420
I actually think they can give us,

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.180
there are reasons and bases

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:02.300
for feeling more connected to each other

01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:06.780
and to the universe, for spiritual experiences,

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:11.780
for even just on a more basic level,

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.100
for increasing our wellbeing,

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:16.540
just in terms of our psychology

01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.580
of lowering rates of depression and anxiety.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.980
And I actually think these realizations

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.180
can be extremely helpful to people.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:29.220
Well, it's like realizing that the universe

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.020
doesn't rotate around earth,

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.220
but the earth is not the center of the universe.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:35.300
It's a really challenging thought.

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:36.620
Well, and people were worried about

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.700
how that would affect society.

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.380
Well, yes, that's like long-term,

01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:43.980
but short-term, I bet you the number of people

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.980
who had an existential crisis

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:48.060
as it got integrated into society,

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.340
that thought is huge.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:51.820
It's like, it's a hard one.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:52.900
And you're saying-

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.300
But it can't, but it's also a source of awe.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:18:00.300
And I mean, so many people now use that fact

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:06.140
to inspire a positive response,

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.340
to inspire creativity and curiosity and awe

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.060
and all of these things that are so useful

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.020
for human wellbeing.

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:20.740
Where's the source of meaning

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:24.140
when you're not the center of the universe,

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.740
when the you doesn't even exist?

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:30.660
That even you, the sense of self

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:35.340
and the sense of decision-making is an illusion.

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:37.820
The truth is that for the most part,

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:42.820
the sense of self is kind of at the core of human suffering,

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.020
because it feels as if we are separate

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.140
from the rest of nature.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.980
We're separate from each other.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.980
We're separate from the illusion that I referenced

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.260
of feeling like we have these thoughts

01:18:58.260 --> 01:18:59.940
that are brain-based thoughts,

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:03.580
but then the eye swoops in to make a decision.

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.660
In some sense, it goes so deep

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.180
that it's as if the eye is separate from the physical world.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:14.540
And that separation plays a part in depression,

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:18.300
plays a part in anxiety, even plays a part in addiction.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:20.340
So at the level of the brain,

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:22.300
I think stop me if I'm repeating myself,

01:19:22.300 --> 01:19:24.900
but we started talking about the default mode network.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.140
And so we actually know that

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.940
when the default mode network is quieted down,

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.820
when people lose a sense of self in meditation

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:38.300
and on psychedelic drugs in therapy,

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.060
there is a feeling that people describe

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:44.820
of an extremely positive feeling

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:48.100
of being connected to the rest of nature.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:50.100
And so that's a piece of it that I think

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:52.060
if you haven't had the experience,

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.140
you wouldn't necessarily know that would be a part of it.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.340
But truly having that insight

01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.900
that you're not the self you feel you are,

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:06.900
immediately your experiences are embedded in the universe

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:11.260
and you are a piece of everything

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.220
and you see that everything is interconnected.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.540
And so rather than feeling like a lonely eye

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:20.500
in this bigger universe, there's a sense of

01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:25.100
being a part of something larger than yourself.

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:30.060
And this is intrinsically positive for human beings.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:32.420
And even just in our everyday lives and choices

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:34.300
and what we do for work,

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:37.900
feeling part of something larger than yourself

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.100
is the way people describe spiritual experiences

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:46.100
and the way many positive psychological states are framed.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.220
And so there's that piece of it.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.540
There is something, so there's one giant hug

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:56.220
with the universe, everything in it.

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:58.700
But there is some sense in which

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:04.060
we attach the search for meaning

01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:08.500
with the eye, with the ego.

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.780
And it could almost seem like life is meaningless.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:18.660
Our existence, our eye, my existence is meaningless.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:21.740
I think you can kind of go there under any worldview,

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:22.580
really.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:27.580
And the truth is we want to find a truth

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:34.340
out of that downward spiral and not a story

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:40.140
that we have to tell ourselves that isn't true.

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:44.060
And the fact is we have these facts available to us

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:49.060
that with the right framing and the right context,

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:54.220
looking at the truth actually provides us

01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.020
with that psychological feeling we're searching for.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.540
And I think that's important to point out.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:04.540
I think humans are fascinatingly good at finding beauty

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.740
in truth no matter how painful the truth is.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:08.580
So yes.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.980
I totally agree, yes.

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:14.860
But in this case, I think there are,

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.740
the concerns are legitimate concerns

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.820
and I have them myself for how people respond.

01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:27.100
I've actually had people tell me

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.740
they had to stop reading my book halfway through

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.540
because the parts on free will were so upsetting to them.

01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:38.060
And this is something I think about a lot

01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:41.500
because that kind of breaks my heart.

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:48.180
I don't, because I see this potential

01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:52.700
for these realizations bringing levels of wellbeing

01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:55.780
that many people don't have access to.

01:22:57.380 --> 01:23:00.020
I think it's important to talk about them

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:05.020
in ways that override what can be an initial fear

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.740
or kind of spooky quality

01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:11.980
that can come out of these realizations.

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:13.340
So at the end of that journey,

01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:17.180
there's a clarity and an appreciation of beauty

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.020
that if you just write it out.

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.620
By the way, if you wanna read up, I'm saying,

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.620
I just gotten through the boy,

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:29.220
the four books if you wanna read upsetting.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.220
So my audible is hilarious.

01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:33.140
So there's Conscious in it.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.140
And then, so your book.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:38.380
And then it has The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:43.140
Bloodlands by Timothy Snyder,

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:45.700
probably the most upsetting book I've ever read.

01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:48.780
If you wanna, because it's not just Stalin or Hitler.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:50.060
It's Stalin and Hitler.

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:53.700
The worst hits, the opposite of the best hits.

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:57.140
It's really, really, really well written, really difficult.

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:02.260
I read Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago

01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:06.300
and what else?

01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:11.300
Red Famine, which is Anne Applebaum, is that her?

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.820
Yeah, anyway, so those are truly upsetting.

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:18.420
And that's, and those are a lot of times

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.940
the results of hiding the truth

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:23.820
versus pursuing the truth.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:26.060
So truth in the short term might hurt,

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:29.380
but it did ultimately set this free.

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:30.340
I believe that.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:34.180
And I also think whatever the truth is,

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:39.180
we have to find a way to maintain civil society and love

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.060
and all the things that are important to us.

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.540
If you can jump around a little bit,

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.420
can I just ask on a personal note,

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.700
because you said you've suffered from depression

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:51.180
and there's a lot of people that see guidance on this topic

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.780
because it's such a difficult one.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:57.780
How were you able to, when it has struck you,

01:24:57.940 --> 01:24:59.540
how were you able to overcome it?

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:02.980
Yeah, I mean, this is maybe too long an answer.

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:05.300
So I've experienced it in different forms.

01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:08.900
So it was my, I would say my depression

01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:12.780
has almost always mostly taken the form of anxiety.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:18.380
I didn't realize how anxious I was,

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:19.860
I think, until I was an adult.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:21.580
So I was always very functional.

01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:27.020
I think all the positive sides of suffering in that way,

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:31.220
I think I'm a little OCD, as you can tell.

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:33.980
And this whole conversation is hilarious

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.420
because we're both suffer to some level of anxiety.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.740
Your psychology is just laid out in front of us here.

01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.100
It's a giant mess.

01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.420
We're the same kind of human.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.020
That's great.

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.580
Just trying, trying to organize.

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:48.380
Hold on, like the Tom Waits song.

01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:53.140
But then I suffered from postpartum depression

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:56.540
after both of my daughters, after both pregnancies.

01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.820
That was a very different experience

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.500
from anything I've ever experienced,

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.780
but clearly I had a predisposition

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:07.380
towards suffering from something like that.

01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:11.740
Anyway, it really wasn't until I fully recovered

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:15.380
from the second experience of postpartum depression

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:18.380
that I realized that I had been suffering

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.460
on some level my whole life.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.060
And I think I always knew,

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.580
I thought of myself as a very sensitive person,

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.140
an empathic person.

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:32.780
I mean, I've been in therapy for 10 years.

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.780
I knew I had a lot of anxiety.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.660
I would never have denied that I had a lot of anxiety.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:43.140
I just didn't realize it crossed over

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:46.980
into a disorder really,

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:51.100
until I was an adult and ended up taking Prozac.

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.380
I took an SSRI for postpartum.

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:58.060
And it was fascinating to me.

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.740
I ended up interviewing my psychiatrist

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.740
because I was so fascinated in the whole thing.

01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:04.540
Once I was on the other side of it,

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.820
just what I had been through,

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.420
how different I felt during that period of time,

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:10.700
and then how quickly the medication

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:13.660
made me feel like myself again.

01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:14.900
I had come out the other side

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:16.660
of the experience of postpartum

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.820
and was going to start tapering off the medication.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.340
And in this window

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.820
where I no longer had postpartum depression

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.380
and hadn't yet gone off the SSRI,

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:37.380
I realized that life was not only a lot easier

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:39.740
than when I had postpartum,

01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.740
but it was easier than it had ever been.

01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.740
And it took taking all of that anxiety away

01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:53.460
to recognize how much I had been grappling with it

01:27:53.460 --> 01:27:55.060
my entire life.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:58.060
And it first started coming in the form of realizations

01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:01.780
like, oh, is this how other people,

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:03.900
is this how other people feel?

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:05.300
Is this how that, like the things

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.980
that I just always thought of myself,

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:10.540
I'm really sensitive, I'm an introvert,

01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.100
I need a lot of time to myself.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:14.900
And all of these things that I felt like,

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.020
I mean, it's always very high functioning.

01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:20.260
And in some ways, I was a professional dancer

01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:22.180
and I think that was the type of therapy for me.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:25.180
There was the obsessing over

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.220
the training and dancing nine hours a day.

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:33.860
And all of that, I now look back on

01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:38.180
and see how much that was therapeutic for me

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:41.220
and that I was kind of treating something.

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:44.020
But yeah, so it was just this experience

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:48.860
of treating an anxiety disorder

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.740
that caused me to realize that I had one.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:54.300
I didn't know I could feel the way I felt

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.300
after taking Prozac.

01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:57.540
And I became very interested in,

01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:00.340
I mean, I was already working with neuroscientists,

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:02.620
I was already interested in consciousness in the brain

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:08.340
and it just, this kind of rattled other intuitions for me

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:13.900
in terms of how our childhoods shape who we become.

01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:20.620
Because I had been convinced my father was,

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:21.620
my father was-

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.620
He's a complicated person as you said before.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.940
That's what I was just gonna say again.

01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.700
But I think, I mean, so he was not diagnosed.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.300
I think he had borderline personality disorder

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:35.060
and was emotionally abusive.

01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:39.300
And I thought that all of the ways I experienced the world

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:41.700
and all of my anxiety and my sensitivities,

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.060
I thought almost all of that, if not all of that,

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.780
was because of these experiences I had growing up

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:51.180
and trauma that I experienced as a child.

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:53.500
And obviously those things play a part.

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.900
But what I realized after going through postpartum

01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.660
and then the thing that was extremely informative to me

01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.260
was having my own children

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:08.500
because they were basically living my dream childhood.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:11.620
They had none of the things that I thought were the cause

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:14.740
of the psychological suffering that I experienced.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:16.780
There was none of that.

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.780
And they have a lot of the same,

01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.380
they struggle with a lot of the same anxiety

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:24.500
and panic attacks.

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.980
And what I realized was

01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.300
how much we're kind of born into the world

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.420
with these things that we struggle with

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:35.100
and with our strengths and with all of that.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:38.220
And of course, then if you have an abusive childhood,

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:41.820
if you're someone who tends to be anxious

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.620
and sensitive and empathic,

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.260
and then you're born into an abusive situation,

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:50.060
that's obvious, terrible combination.

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:54.060
But I never acknowledged or realized how strong

01:30:55.060 --> 01:31:00.060
just the genetics and the wiring played.

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.540
Where's the line between you kind of accepting

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:06.340
the challenges you're born with

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:08.460
and this is what life will be

01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.340
versus then figuring out

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.060
that life can be somehow different?

01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:16.020
I think they're part of the same process.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:21.020
And I think it's kind of necessary to accept

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:27.820
what you're experiencing and what the situation is

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:32.820
and how you feel and the types of thoughts and patterns

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.300
you tend toward in order to make

01:31:37.300 --> 01:31:38.820
whatever changes can be made.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:41.460
So I do think it's kind of part of the same process.

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:43.300
Could life have been any different?

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.060
I mean, do you regret certain aspects

01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:49.260
of the decisions made not by you?

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.980
I mean, it depends on what level we're talking.

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:53.980
I think at a fundamental level,

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.860
I don't believe anything could be different.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:32:00.140
Are you able to think at that level about your own life?

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:02.140
Sure, and that's actually that's part of what I was,

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.380
when I wanted to kind of talk a little bit

01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:08.420
about the levels of usefulness

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.140
of being aware of these different illusions,

01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:15.860
because I would say most of the time in our daily lives,

01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:18.820
the types of illusions that I'm interested in shaking up

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:23.740
are not useful to remind ourselves of most of the time.

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:27.060
I really think there are different levels of usefulness

01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:31.900
to thinking about and reminding ourselves

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.740
of the places where we have false intuitions.

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:39.740
And so I often use the analogy of living on a sphere.

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:47.100
So it still feels to most of us, most of the time,

01:32:47.100 --> 01:32:48.140
I mean, our intuitive sense,

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:50.860
we're not thinking about whether the earth is flat

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:54.460
or a sphere, but we behave as if it's flat.

01:32:54.460 --> 01:32:56.020
And that makes the most sense.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:01.020
And it would be exhausting to keep reminding ourselves

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.380
as we walk down the street,

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.860
like it feels flat, but it's not flat.

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.020
It's like, there's just no reason to do it.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:09.300
It's not useful in that moment.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:10.220
If you're building a house,

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:12.300
you can build it as if the world is flat.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.940
But of course, so there are psychological reasons

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.060
to bring it into view,

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:21.580
and maybe even spiritual reasons to bring it into view.

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.940
And then there's just like usefulness.

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.780
So if you're building a rocket to the moon,

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:30.620
you better understand the geometry of the earth.

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.740
Even if you're flying an airplane,

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:33.580
if you're an airplane pilot,

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:37.060
you have to be aware of the truth of our situation.

01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.780
And then I think there are other places

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.420
where it's interesting to remind ourselves

01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.220
is where I start out my book,

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:48.780
just as a way to inspire awe

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:51.740
and to get yourself out of your everyday life

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:53.260
and see the big picture,

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.580
which can be just a relief,

01:33:56.580 --> 01:34:00.980
but also helps you feel more connected to the universe

01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:03.340
and to something larger than ourselves.

01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:08.340
And so I see these intuitions reminding ourselves

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.780
that these intuitions are illusions in the same way,

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.340
that most of the time they're not useful.

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.860
They are useful if we want to think

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:19.180
about a science of consciousness.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.820
They're useful for a whole range

01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.460
of neuroscientific studies.

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:26.620
And I think they can be incredibly useful

01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:29.940
in the same way that lying on the ground

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:33.580
and feeling the gravity pushing you against a sphere

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:36.860
and realizing you're floating in the middle of outer space,

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.300
it gives me the same feeling to realize.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.660
And so I have, I mean, there's so many levels to it,

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:47.980
but if I'm thinking about difficult things

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:52.540
that I've experienced, different traumas in my life,

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.820
when I take a step back and kind of get this bird's eye view

01:34:55.820 --> 01:35:00.020
of kind of the mystery of this unfolding of the universe

01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:04.460
and the fact that it happened the way it happened

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.620
and whether it could have happened another way,

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:09.980
there's no going back, that's the way it unfolded.

01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.940
And being able to surrender to that,

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:17.380
I think is very psychologically healthy

01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:20.500
and prevents us from, I mean, I think regret

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:24.980
is one of the most toxic loops we can get into.

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.180
So this is a path to acceptance.

01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:30.060
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:33.460
Because free will, I mean, I think part of what,

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.980
the function of the experience of it is learning.

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:39.420
I mean, I think we can still learn

01:35:39.420 --> 01:35:42.540
without being under the illusion that we have free will.

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:46.940
So for some people, depression can destroy them.

01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:51.460
So how can you think about avoiding that?

01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:56.820
Yeah, so I didn't totally answer your question.

01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.820
First is therapy, ways that I have worked

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:06.620
through anxiety and depression.

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:11.620
So you're an introvert and a deeply intellectual person

01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:14.260
therapy works for you?

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:18.220
To a point, it was very helpful.

01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:21.180
I mean, I think talk therapy is one tool

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:25.940
and can be helpful for, I mean, it depends on the therapist,

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:27.060
it depends on the type of therapy,

01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:31.500
but I found it to be one piece

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:34.140
and probably not the biggest piece actually.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:40.300
But I think, I wish I had discovered medication sooner

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.820
that would have made a big difference in my life.

01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:45.940
Even just intellectually to realize that,

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.340
oh, like I'm not.

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:51.340
Life was a lot harder than it needed to be.

01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:53.940
And it wasn't about keeping everything just so.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:57.620
There's another state my brain can be in

01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:01.220
where I don't have to work so hard to be okay.

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.340
Meditation was probably the most,

01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:08.700
meditation and psychedelic experiences

01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:10.860
were probably the most transformative.

01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.380
But a lot of these things don't,

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:18.740
I'm lucky that I didn't,

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:23.740
my anxiety and depression never really got in the way

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.580
of my living my life, of enjoying my life.

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:30.420
I mean, there were struggles, it made life harder for me.

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:37.180
But something like treatment resistant depression

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:42.180
or severe PTSD, these are things that,

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.660
at this point in time, based on my understanding,

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:50.940
I think once you've tried,

01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.580
and the truth is that meditation

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:55.260
is often not helpful for those things,

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.180
it can actually exacerbate them.

01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:01.740
And the most promising thing that I have seen

01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:04.580
is this research into psychedelic,

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:06.780
therapy assisted psychedelic.

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.140
If that makes sense to you,

01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:10.300
that psychedelics work so well for such difficult cases,

01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:12.580
what is it about psychedelics?

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.060
And I've been following this research from the beginning

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.860
when they were doing end of life.

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:18.900
Yeah, they started with end of life patients,

01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.300
I don't know, maybe 20 years ago,

01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:21.980
I met at a TED conference,

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.820
I met one of the doctors who was doing this research.

01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.460
It was the first time I became aware

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:29.420
that the research was happening,

01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:32.980
and I already had my own experiences before that.

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.100
And so it made perfect sense to me that this would work.

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:38.700
It was still astonishing to see the results,

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:43.700
to see how successful the work is so much of the time,

01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.260
but it doesn't surprise me, it makes sense.

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.220
And it's actually in line with all of these other things.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:52.620
So quieting down the default mode network.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.860
One of the things that's so transformative

01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.220
about taking something like psilocybin,

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:00.940
and everyone's experience is different,

01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:02.700
and it can vary each time you take it,

01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:04.300
even in a single person.

01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.140
But the experience I had and the experience

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.260
that many people have that is so transformative

01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:11.660
is this feeling that's very hard to describe,

01:39:11.660 --> 01:39:15.900
but it's a feeling of being one with the universe.

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:19.180
And that comes with, it's kind of all one feeling

01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.540
that is, again, hard to put into words,

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.820
but there's this feeling that everything is okay.

01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.980
And I'd never had that feeling before in my life.

01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:31.180
And when I took psychedelics,

01:39:31.180 --> 01:39:33.940
that feeling would stay with me for months.

01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:35.180
And I never understood why,

01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.460
and it was always fascinating to me,

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:38.900
but it was as if I was glimpsing

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:40.500
a deeper truth of the world

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:45.500
that it's all one thing, we're all connected.

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:51.660
There's no sense that there could even be

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:52.980
a feeling of loneliness.

01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:57.020
It was just this visceral sense of being one with everything

01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:58.620
and that everything was okay,

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:01.020
that all the things I was afraid of, even death,

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:06.780
that the universe in a sense is an endless recycling.

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.620
And I don't know, it's hard to describe,

01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:13.900
but we also know on the other side

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:16.540
that depression and anxiety,

01:40:16.540 --> 01:40:18.660
when people are experiencing those things,

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:23.660
the default mode network is more active.

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:28.700
And so it's this cycling and this kind of obsessive cycles

01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.540
of thinking about oneself

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:34.220
that is a huge part of the suffering in the first place.

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:38.380
And so the one thing that's surprising to me

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:43.380
about the research is that I may be fudging the data,

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:47.820
but it's something like 80% of people

01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:51.780
who are treated for PTSD after one,

01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:56.620
only one session are cured of their PTSD.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.580
Yeah, the effect stays for prolonged periods of time.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.420
That's really interesting.

01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.340
And addiction as well, which is interesting.

01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:07.100
That's not something I'm personally familiar with,

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:08.420
so that was a surprise to me.

01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:11.980
But yeah, I mean, it's just wonderful that we...

01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:13.180
Yeah, it's incredible.

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:15.580
I mean, of course it's also incredible for people

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.620
who don't suffer to see what psychedelics

01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:21.700
can do with the mind, which is that kind of appreciation.

01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:24.780
Well, and I think it's actually important for this work.

01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:28.460
It's one of the questions I ask everyone I talk to

01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:32.220
for this series, many of them,

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:35.940
I won't be able to use that audio for a lot of them.

01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:38.380
Yes, and what their experience was and if that's informed.

01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:40.820
Actually, initially in the 50s,

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:42.980
I want to do more research on this and look into it,

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.140
but in the 50s, there were some studies

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.620
that were being done with scientists who,

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:52.380
there were hundreds of scientists they put into the study

01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:56.340
where they were on the brink of some kind of discovery,

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:57.180
where they were stuck.

01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:59.700
So they had been doing research and they were stuck

01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:03.380
and they used psychedelics to come up with an answer

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:04.740
to find a path forward.

01:42:04.740 --> 01:42:07.460
And it was extremely useful for that.

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:08.700
Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating.

01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:11.540
And the nice thing about psychedelics from my perception

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.900
is that they don't currently suffer from the taboo

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:19.660
that weed does, I don't think.

01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:24.340
So like, for example, there's some kind of cultural

01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:29.340
construct about a pothead that makes it so that,

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:31.980
like Elon got in trouble for smoking weed.

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:33.180
Right, he would have gotten in trouble

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.100
for taking mushrooms too.

01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:35.940
I don't know.

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.760
Really?

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:37.600
I don't think so.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.440
Oh, that's interesting.

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.260
I don't think so.

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.100
That's a surprise to me.

01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:40.940
That's great.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.300
Because mushrooms to me seem like a journey,

01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.260
like there's a perception that you don't take mushrooms

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.100
all the time.

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:49.540
It's not an addictive substance, it's not a lifestyle.

01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:51.260
It's like going to Burning Man.

01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:53.300
It's like an experience that stays with you

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.140
for a long time.

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:55.540
I didn't realize that understanding

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.420
had permeated into the culture.

01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:00.820
Yeah, that's a good question, if it has or not,

01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:03.420
because maybe I have a very narrow perspective

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:06.860
of these kinds of things, but I think what has permeated

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:09.540
is through Hollywood ideas of what it means

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.260
to be a person who smokes weed a lot.

01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.100
Yeah.

01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:16.220
And that has like, has had its effect,

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:21.260
just hilarious given the effects of weed versus alcohol,

01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:24.540
but that's a whole nother story.

01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.820
Have you taken psychedelics?

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:26.660
Yes.

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:27.740
And you've spoken about it on your podcast.

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:30.380
Yeah, yeah, well not a lot.

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:32.300
I really want to do a lot more.

01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:34.220
I've taken mushrooms.

01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:35.420
Evasperations.

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:37.700
Yeah, I mean, because I'm such a,

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.280
and I didn't have, I have a very addictive personality,

01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:43.020
so I'm very nervous about substances,

01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:45.980
but I didn't have any addictive relationship

01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.100
with that thing.

01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:48.220
Well, every time I-

01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:50.940
It is a treatment for addiction, so.

01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.780
Interesting.

01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:56.780
But I'm almost nervous because every time

01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:01.160
I've taken mushrooms, I've had a really pleasant experience.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:06.160
I mean, it was, it's already the thing I feel anyway,

01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:08.200
but I feel it more intensely.

01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.620
The thing I feel anyway is like appreciation of the moment,

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.020
how beautiful life is.

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:16.300
The weird thing that I feel, not throughout the day,

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:18.580
but certain moments of the day, especially early on,

01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.940
that's like life is intensely beautiful.

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.100
Like, that's usually when I'll tweet.

01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:26.940
Yeah.

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:28.980
It's like everything is, everything is awesome.

01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:31.240
And I remember those feelings,

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.940
because sometimes when I feel really down

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.500
and all those kinds of things,

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:37.540
you remember that it's a roller coaster,

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.960
and you just, and then you find the good feelings,

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:40.960
and it's cool.

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.400
And it does make me a little bit sad that they kind of fade,

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:48.400
but then as they get older, you get to use those moments.

01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:50.920
You realize they don't use them well, you know?

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.960
When you feel great, when you're focused,

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.560
all that kind of stuff, use them well,

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.960
because the mind is a roller coaster.

01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.960
Yes, it's true.

01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.080
That's partly why I do this work.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:00.400
I feel like my work is therapy.

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.100
I don't know if you feel that way.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:03.280
Work is therapy.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:04.980
This work, not work in general.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:08.720
Thinking about the deep questions,

01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:11.680
thinking about the nature of the universe,

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.560
thinking about consciousness, even meditation.

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.040
I mean, I got into meditation, to me, it's interesting.

01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.040
To me, I think a lot of meditators feel this way about it,

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:25.880
but I think just, I'm thinking about it

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:27.080
from the perspective of someone

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:30.280
who hasn't meditated before,

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.900
but it feels like a scientific experiment.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:36.560
It feels like it's the same physicist in me

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.360
who was drawn to meditation

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.360
because the experience is one of getting closer

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:48.960
to your experience and asking similarly deep questions.

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.640
Like, what is time?

01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:51.600
What does that even mean?

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.320
What do I mean by time?

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:54.520
What does it feel like?

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:56.680
What is a thought is one

01:45:56.680 --> 01:45:59.120
of the most interesting questions to me.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:45:59.940
How do you meditate?

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:00.780
Let's talk about this.

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:03.080
So what you let go of time.

01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.580
Well, I'm not really doing anything.

01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.660
The exercise is really so simple.

01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.220
It's just paying attention

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.220
to your present moment experience.

01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:15.740
And it's an extremely challenging thing to do.

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:18.460
It's not the natural state of the brain.

01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.780
It's an exercise in concentration,

01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:26.260
which is why athletes and other people

01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:31.260
who spend a lot of time needing to focus intensely

01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:32.260
find it so useful.

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:36.800
I mean, it's really a focus, a concentration practice,

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:41.420
but all it is really, I mean, there are different ways,

01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:42.860
there are different methods,

01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:47.820
but it really is quite simple at its core,

01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:50.500
which is just paying close attention

01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.460
to your present moment experience.

01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.100
And so in Vipassana,

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.980
which is what I've mostly been trained in,

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:01.640
you're usually paying attention to the breath,

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.360
but there's always some focus of concentration.

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:07.320
And the focus can even be just an open awareness,

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:09.960
just watching your mind go,

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.160
just what comes into your experience.

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.000
And part of that is the mind,

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:14.640
part of it is the external world.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.600
So you hear a sound, you think a thought,

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:22.280
you feel a feeling, your cheek is itching.

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.520
Am I gonna scratch it?

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:25.080
Am I not gonna scratch it?

01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:28.560
Just like, sounds like the most boring thing in the world.

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:30.720
And what's interesting is,

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.320
paying close attention to the most boring thing

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.160
in the world is incredibly fascinating.

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.600
Noticing that each breath, no two breaths are the same,

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.600
that time keeps moving, that your thoughts keep appearing.

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.760
It's there, yeah, I mean,

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.600
it's a spiritual practice for a reason.

01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.880
You notice more and more beautiful things

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:55.560
about the simpler, simpler things.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:57.000
Yeah, it's great.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.040
I like to do that.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:03.240
I don't meditate, I've tried a few times and I will,

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.640
but I meditate, I do meditate,

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:08.800
but not, I meditate by thinking about a thing

01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.400
and like holding onto that thing and just like,

01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:17.760
it's not really, I guess, technically meditation,

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.840
but it's keeping a focus on an idea

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.400
and then you walk with it

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.240
and you solve the little puzzle of it,

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:28.240
especially any kind of programming or math stuff,

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.760
you're holding stuff in your head and you,

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.760
but don't look stuff up, don't take notes,

01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.000
if you're only allowed to have your mind and that's it.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.600
You would really enjoy a meditation retreat.

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:44.080
I mean, you would also not enjoy it.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.920
It would be hard because it's all,

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:48.320
you wouldn't go nuts, it would be hard,

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.880
but you would get it.

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.000
What's a meditation retreat?

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.520
Is it usually silent or?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.680
It is always silent or actually,

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.600
at least the one I would recommend you do

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:59.120
is a silent meditation retreat.

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.440
Five days.

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.280
Five days, okay.

01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.040
We'll talk later, but you might be my next victim.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:06.360
I have,

01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:07.480
Convert.

01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:09.360
Five days is a long time.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.800
It's a long time.

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:11.800
To just sit.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:12.880
It changes your brain.

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:14.320
It's the type of experience

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.160
that will change your brain permanently.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:19.400
There's been like two, three, four hour sessions

01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.240
of thinking that break in.

01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:21.080
And you don't have children.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:21.920
I don't have children.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:22.760
You've got to.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.000
Oh, the children.

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:27.120
Leaving them for five days and not speaking

01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.760
and impossible.

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.440
I've only done one retreat since I had kids

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:35.280
doing another one soon, but only two nights.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:37.320
Maybe that's what the thoughts will be coming in my head.

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.240
You should be getting married, you should have kids.

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.240
Whatever, let the thoughts be.

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.080
I think it's always nice.

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:45.880
You'll get really good at letting things just be

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.520
and focusing on the present moment.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.040
And you might come out with some epiphany

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:52.320
about what you should do next.

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:56.360
No, I love that, yeah, obviously.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:57.200
I love that, yeah.

01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.360
I love that, you know, I fast for three days.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.760
I want to fast for longer.

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:03.880
That's also in a different way perhaps,

01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.520
but it brings you, makes you more sensitive

01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.760
to the world around you somehow.

01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.880
I'm not exactly sure what the chemistry of that is,

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.880
but obviously, it's just not obvious

01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:16.200
because you're not always that hungry.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:19.800
But you're more, time slows down and you feel things.

01:50:19.800 --> 01:50:22.040
You feel a breeze, all this kind of stuff.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.600
It's very interesting.

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:26.800
You've, I think tweeted something about ideas coming out

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.520
from sometimes feeling about coming

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.640
from outside of you sometimes.

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.080
So you mentioned as you meditate,

01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.360
you know, you notice these ideas come in.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:42.360
So thoughts, ideas, how did that connect consciousness?

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.600
So the thing I was responding to that you wrote,

01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:54.600
I think I was partly picking up on the part of you

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:02.000
that would really get a lot out of a meditation retreat.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.480
That was my way of beginning that conversation.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.200
That experience you had of a thought coming

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:17.520
from somewhere else, when you spend an extended period

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.360
of time paying close attention

01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.400
to your moment to moment experience,

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.200
that's how all of your thoughts appear to you.

01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:31.600
And it's really beautiful because you're letting go

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:34.360
just through the practice of meditation,

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:38.920
you're quieting down your default mode network.

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.920
And without necessarily intellectually thinking yourself

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:49.200
out of free will, it naturally kind of drops away.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.560
And so when you're under the spell of this illusion

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:55.400
that you are the author of your thoughts

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:57.960
and your conscious experience is driving

01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.680
all of your behavior and there's this eye

01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:03.960
that stands somewhere near your brain,

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.400
but is not your brain that stands free

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:09.760
of the physical world is the thing generating the thoughts.

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.760
When you're meditating, that quiets down

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:18.920
and can kind of quiet down completely

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:23.360
so that your experience is just of the next thing arising

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.920
in your conscious awareness.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:29.000
But the source of that is still this brain.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:30.880
What you realize is the source of it

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.400
is not your conscious experience.

01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.520
And that's the important insight.

01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:38.760
And that's the insight.

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:41.040
And so there are many insights you can have in meditation

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.440
that align with the science,

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.960
which is what's really fascinating

01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:45.240
because it doesn't have to be that way.

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:47.240
Like I can imagine finding meditation

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:49.960
to be extremely useful and helping me with anxiety

01:52:49.960 --> 01:52:52.000
and all the rest and having all kinds of insights

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.960
that turn out to not be true.

01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:56.400
But the interesting thing is that these insights

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.960
actually turn out to be true.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.880
And so that is one of them is the,

01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:07.920
when you're just watching what your conscious experience

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:11.560
actually is, you realize that it's not doing

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:14.120
all of the things you usually feel like it's doing.

01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.640
And so the thoughts really just arise

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:23.640
in much the same way that a sound or a sight or a feeling,

01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:27.560
maybe your leg starts to hurt.

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:30.800
When you're just watching moment by moment by moment,

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:34.440
pain arises, a bird chirping arises,

01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:37.560
a thought arises, a feeling arises.

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:41.520
You're just kind of watching it all unfold.

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:44.440
And there's something really beautiful about that.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:49.360
Yeah, it's the perspective you could take on

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.280
is there's a connectedness to the entirety of the universe,

01:53:53.280 --> 01:53:55.120
like to nature in general.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:58.000
And that there's something so beautiful about consciousness,

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:02.320
about the fact that it's not just a dead universe

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.200
with atoms doing their thing,

01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:07.560
that at least in this one instance,

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:12.480
there is a felt experience of the universe.

01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.320
Of the universe, it's not even an individual.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.120
I'm part of the universe, yeah.

01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:19.480
There's a, right here in this little point in space and time,

01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:21.720
there is an experience of the universe.

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:25.920
But it's still interesting to think about where those ideas,

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.680
if those ideas are solely a construction of the brain,

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.880
or is there some kind of mechanism

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:33.560
of joint collective intelligence of humans

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.280
as social organisms?

01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.480
Where those, like,

01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:42.880
like how much of it is me training my neural network

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:46.120
and the ideas of tens of thousands of other people?

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.440
And how much is it myself?

01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:49.560
You're talking like in terms of psychic phenomena,

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:52.160
or you're talking in terms of just absorbing

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:55.400
the information of the past and education,

01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:59.800
and just kind of our collective human project

01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:01.520
that gets in throughout our lives.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.720
I don't know much about psychic phenomena,

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:05.600
but I also want to be open-minded

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.840
in the way we speak about collective intelligence,

01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.080
because it's very easy to simplify to,

01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:13.160
it's a neural network trained on knowledge

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.120
developed over generations and so on.

01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.560
It does feel like intelligence is stored

01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:24.720
in some kind of distributed fashion across humans.

01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:26.120
Like if you take one out,

01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:30.880
I think that intelligence quickly goes down.

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:32.040
I don't know how quickly it goes down

01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.200
if you just take one out and depends on which one.

01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.120
I think I half agree and half disagree

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:38.320
with what you're saying.

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.280
But yeah, I mean, the other thing you notice

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:43.640
when you spend a lot of time in meditation,

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:45.520
and when you spend a lot of time kind of shaking up

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.800
these intuitions that I think get in the way

01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:52.800
of clearly thinking about what consciousness is,

01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:58.720
is that we are these systems in nature

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.200
that are not at all isolated.

01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.640
And there are the obvious ways,

01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.720
like if I just stopped drinking water,

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:09.520
that's gonna change the system very drastically, right?

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:12.720
So there's just the energy consumption.

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.160
But the fact that we exchange ideas is,

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:22.760
part of who I am is everyone I've interacted with.

01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:24.800
And of course the people I interact more with

01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:26.240
have sculpted me more,

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.200
but our brains are sculpted through our interactions

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.120
with each other as well.

01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:35.760
Yes, but I wonder if it's a more correct

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:38.280
and useful perspective to take

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:41.480
that those interactions are the organisms.

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:45.240
Like you're saying,

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:48.080
you're still making the brain the primary.

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.080
That could be like that the brain is what it is

01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.280
because of the social interactions,

01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:01.040
and the social interactions are the living organism.

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:05.040
That's a weird perspective,

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:05.880
because it's so much more-

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:08.040
I don't actually think it's one or the other.

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:11.040
They're both, they're both both living.

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:11.880
Yeah.

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:12.960
It's like cats and dogs.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:16.640
Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit like,

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:18.680
I have two children and a lot of people

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:20.200
with two children will say,

01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.760
when you're preparing to have the second one

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.240
soon after you've had the second one,

01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:28.280
that having two is kind of like having three

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.280
because you are nourishing and protecting

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:36.480
and overseeing each individual life.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:39.480
But then there's the sibling relationship,

01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.000
which is almost another thing.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Yeah, it's weird.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
So you've spoken with Don Hoffman a few times.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:48.840
Yes.

01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.680
In his book, Case Against Reality.

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.000
Many more than a few, yeah.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.040
Many more than a few.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.600
There's a lot of fun ones.

01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:56.000
Was there one with Sam was involved?

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.120
Sam and I interviewed him.

01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:57.960
Yeah, sorry.

01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:59.880
Most of the conversations I've had with him are private.

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:02.320
They're not public, but we used to meet before the pandemic.

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.600
We were meeting about monthly to discuss ideas.

01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:09.160
I would love to be a fly in the wall of those discussions,

01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.200
but he wrote a book, Case Against Reality,

01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:14.640
makes the case that our perception

01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.640
is completely detached from objective reality.

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:21.360
Can you explain his perspective

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:25.160
and let us know, well, no, no, maybe not fully,

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:29.680
but to which degree you agree and don't.

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.880
So this is much more focused.

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.600
I guess you guys have an agreement

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.160
that consciousness is somehow fundamental.

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.520
Yeah, I mean, I think we both think we might be wrong.

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:42.080
About the consciousness or about reality?

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.640
About it being fundamental.

01:58:43.640 --> 01:58:46.440
I think we're both just, we both agree

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:51.240
that this is a legitimate question to ask at this point

01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:53.440
in science, is consciousness fundamental?

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:57.400
And I really see it as a question and I think he does too.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.400
But he goes hard on reality.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:03.400
Yes, and it's interesting because I, you know,

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.440
especially, so I actually now have recorded

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:08.120
three conversations with him for this project

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.680
I'm working on, yeah.

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:13.120
And in every conversation we have,

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.440
we seem to land on the same place,

01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.160
but this last conversation we had,

01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:20.440
it seemed to be even more clear that the semantics

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:21.520
will really get in the way.

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.880
When you get into the weeds in these conversations,

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:29.200
it's almost like we need some new terminology

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.400
because it's hard to know sometimes

01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:34.560
whether we're talking about the same thing.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
I have issues with his terminology that when we talk

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.680
about what his terminology represents,

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:46.640
it seems like we completely agree.

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:49.800
But the conclusions you don't?

01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:54.680
It's possible we have a very similar view of the universe

01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:56.240
if consciousness is fundamental.

01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:57.960
It may be an identical view.

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:00.880
It's hard for me to know because I disagree

02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:02.800
with a lot of his terminology.

02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.160
Okay, but our four dimensional reality,

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:08.720
he says that's like a complete construct,

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:12.160
space time is a complete weird construction that.

02:00:12.160 --> 02:00:14.760
Yeah, well I mean the truth is that,

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:17.680
I mean if you talk to a neuroscientist like Anil Seth

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:19.920
and I would say most neuroscientists,

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:21.920
but he's really good on this subject

02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:26.560
and his expertise and his area of focus is in perception.

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.920
So he talks a lot about how our perceptions

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:31.880
give us an experience of the world

02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:34.600
and he calls it a controlled hallucination.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.920
I'm sorry, I think he says that he got that term

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:41.360
from someone else, but that's the term he used.

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:43.880
We got every term from somewhere else.

02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.720
That's true.

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:45.960
Everything, there's no new ideas.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:49.960
All right, there's a sense in which what Hoffman is saying

02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:52.720
is already, we already know to be the case.

02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.160
So our brains are creating this conscious experience

02:00:57.160 --> 02:01:01.200
based on these interactions with the outside world.

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.800
It is in some sense all a controlled hallucination

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.160
and someone like Anil Seth,

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:09.120
so from the neuroscientific point of view,

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:10.800
I actually have a quote here somewhere

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:13.880
if you have any interest in hearing the quote,

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:18.480
but he's essentially saying everything we experience

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.480
as a perception, including our experience of time and space.

02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:28.560
So we still don't really know what our experience of space

02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:32.320
represents out there in the world.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:34.280
And then of course, when you talk to physicists

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.480
about the different interpretations of quantum mechanics,

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.640
I mean, where physics seems to be headed across the board

02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.640
at this point is that space and time are emergent,

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:48.680
that they're not part of the fundamental fabric of reality.

02:01:48.680 --> 02:01:53.680
And so there's some ways in which Don is saying things that-

02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.600
Is he being too poetic about it?

02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:00.600
Is that the right way to phrase it?

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:02.320
Cause like- No, go ahead.

02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:06.040
He says like, it's not that our perception

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:08.800
is just a controlled hallucination.

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:10.240
Well- No, it's not.

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.200
He's saying something more than that, that's true.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:15.920
But my point is that a lot of what he's already saying

02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.800
on some level, science is already there

02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:20.240
and could agree with.

02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:23.480
Yeah, but not all the way.

02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:28.480
Cause he's saying like, that we don't even,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.720
the evolutionary process has constructed

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:35.600
our brain mechanisms in such a way

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:38.400
that we're really far from having access

02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:40.840
to objective reality.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:43.160
Yes, although I think we already know that as well.

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.360
I mean, if any version of string theory is correct,

02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.800
and of course we don't know yet, it's all up for grabs,

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:51.960
but the truth is each theory is weirder than the last.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.280
If there are 15 dimensions of space,

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.280
we are just not wired to be able to understand

02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.480
the fundamental reality.

02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:10.560
But I think we have a consistent abstraction

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:15.240
that seems to be reliable, like a blockchain.

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:17.640
Yes, and he's not just saying that we really only

02:03:17.640 --> 02:03:19.560
have this tiny window onto reality.

02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:22.400
He's saying that that window onto reality

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:25.480
is giving us a lot of false information, it's not true.

02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:27.680
It's not just an abstraction, it's false,

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.480
because he's saying there's no reason it needs to be true.

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.880
There's no, it's not required to be true.

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:40.720
And in fact, through natural selection,

02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:44.920
it's very possible to imagine, or it's likely to imagine

02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:46.960
that organisms will evolve in such a way

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:51.960
that you're going to just be lying to yourself completely.

02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:55.200
But the question there is, if that's the case,

02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.040
it's a really interesting thing to think about.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.680
I think the rigor with which he approaches it

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:04.680
is really admirable, and I do think it's scientific.

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.880
But it's, the question for me is why is it so consistent

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.640
across all of these organisms?

02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.400
We all seem to see the table, like, and feel,

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.240
and run into the table.

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:20.480
So what he will agree, so what I would say to that,

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.680
and when I've posed this to him,

02:04:21.680 --> 02:04:23.480
I really don't wanna speak for him,

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.600
but I'll answer it myself and say that I believe

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.480
he agrees with what I'm about to say,

02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:34.600
which is that the things we perceive

02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:39.440
are connected to the structure of reality.

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.600
It's just that the structure of reality

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:43.880
is made of something completely different

02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:46.000
than the thing we're experiencing.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.560
So imagine, if you just go with the holographic principle,

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:53.480
you know, loosely, and actually,

02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:56.480
the holographic principle applies to black holes only.

02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:00.960
So there's ADS-CFT duality, antidesider space,

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.960
and conformal field theory.

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.640
Am I getting all these terms right?

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:07.600
The terms are right, but I can't believe we're going there.

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.280
Well, I mean, this is where I've gone

02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:10.800
in all of my conversations with physicists,

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:14.880
because the idea is, so if we just have the basic principle

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.560
that reality and all of the information can be contained,

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.680
or is actually in a two-dimensional space

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:26.160
that gets projected, this is something that you don't buy

02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:28.080
based on the look on your face.

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:30.080
No, no, no, I'm actually freaking out,

02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:33.560
because yes, any theory of modern physics

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:36.840
gives inkling that reality is very weird.

02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:39.520
Right, and completely different from how we experience it.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:40.720
That's one example.

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:43.760
So this is an intuition that, for whatever reason,

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:46.040
has always felt true to me.

02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:48.520
This is the way I thought about things as a child.

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.240
I've met other people that felt this way

02:05:50.240 --> 02:05:52.360
when I've had experiences in psychedelics,

02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.360
and this is where I start to sound crazy, too.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:06:00.080
Nope, everybody else is crazy, except us.

02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:04.400
But that has always seemed right to me,

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:08.560
and that's always the thing that I feel like I'm looking for.

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:11.080
It's funny, recently I was thinking that,

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.920
it's as if I feel like I'm, and this is more how,

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:16.480
I was thinking of how I felt as a child,

02:06:16.480 --> 02:06:19.680
but I feel this way a lot as an adult, too,

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:23.400
that the image is one of a snow globe,

02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:26.800
that I'm confined to this snow globe

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:29.160
based on my human perceptions,

02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:32.120
and the truth of reality is out there.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:34.600
And it's actually why I'm so drawn to shaking intuitions.

02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:36.400
I feel like every time we shake up an intuition,

02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.680
it's like an opportunity to leave the snow globe

02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:40.760
for a moment.

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:42.680
It's like smashing the marbles and seeing,

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.400
oh, it's not liquid in there like I thought.

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.200
It's getting this glimpse of something truer

02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:50.720
than what we typically experience.

02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:53.840
I feel like it's for a long time gonna be snow globes

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.960
inside snow globes, inside snow globes.

02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:58.280
But the larger point is that, yes,

02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.640
whatever is true about the fundamental nature of reality

02:07:00.640 --> 02:07:03.160
is not something we're experiencing.

02:07:03.160 --> 02:07:07.880
However, it is linked and gives us clues to it.

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:10.360
So one image I came up with recently,

02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:11.520
I actually wrote about this,

02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:14.600
I have an article in Nautilus about time,

02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:17.520
because as I spend time thinking about

02:07:17.560 --> 02:07:21.000
what it would mean for consciousness to be fundamental.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.720
And at the same time, I'm talking to physicists

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.200
about different interpretations of quantum mechanics

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:30.480
and the fact that the ones I'm talking to

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:33.440
believe that space and time are emergent

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.600
and are not part of the fundamental story.

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:39.440
I was thinking about what is it,

02:07:41.960 --> 02:07:46.040
what could time be if it's not the way we experience it?

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.160
What could it be pointing to?

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:51.760
And I'm not the first person to think like this.

02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.120
Many people have developed different thought experiments

02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:59.720
around this, and I'm not saying this is the way things are,

02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:04.720
but this is just one solution is that time and causality

02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.800
appear to us the way they do because for whatever reason,

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.960
we're only perceiving one moment at a time.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:19.840
And these connections between events

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:24.360
that we perceive as time are actually

02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:25.880
just part of the fabric of reality.

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:29.840
There's some structure to reality at a deeper level

02:08:30.800 --> 02:08:33.200
where it's like shining a flashlight

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:35.920
on the structure of reality where for us,

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:38.120
for whatever reason, everything else disappears.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.760
And the only thing that exists is that single

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:46.800
pinprick of light that we happen to be inhabiting

02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:49.520
or that we can perceive, but that the rest of it is there.

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:52.840
And so that even though time would be an illusion

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.920
and the causality and the way we experience it

02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:00.640
is an illusion, or it doesn't mean what we think it means,

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.560
it's still pointing to a deeper structure.

02:09:02.560 --> 02:09:04.720
There's something that it corresponds to

02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:06.360
in the fundamental nature of reality.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:10.080
And I've had enough conversations with Don, I think,

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:15.600
to know that he would agree with that,

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:20.600
that our perceptions map onto something.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:26.240
It's just not the experience of it that we're having.

02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.240
So to go back to the idea that all of reality

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:36.120
could be contained in two dimensions

02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.160
and there's something about the interaction

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.320
between different points that cause this holograph

02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.720
so that it seems like there's a three-dimensional world

02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:47.880
when in fact that it's a projection

02:09:47.880 --> 02:09:49.560
of this two-dimensional surface.

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:58.280
What we experience as space still references something

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:03.160
at the fundamental level.

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.640
It's just that it's not space.

02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:08.080
And that is something that makes a lot of sense to me.

02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.440
I posted an excerpt, George Musser wrote a great book,

02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:15.680
Fooky Action at a Distance, Fooky Action at a Distance.

02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:23.240
He's a great science writer and he talks about ways

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:26.560
to kind of absorb what this would mean,

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:29.320
this ADS-CFT duality.

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.920
And he gives an example of music as an analogy,

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.600
that two different notes can exist in three dimensions

02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.720
as if the other doesn't exist

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:44.560
because of the frequency of the sound waves.

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.320
And that in another way, you can think of the sound waves

02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:50.280
existing in different dimensions.

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.520
I don't know if that's, I-

02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:55.960
Yeah, that's really interesting.

02:10:55.960 --> 02:10:57.600
I don't speak as well as I write.

02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:00.800
So I've written about this in a way

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:03.120
that I think is easier to absorb

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.280
than the way I just described it.

02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.640
But I think causality is the trickiest one,

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:08.640
trickier one.

02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:13.040
Time is a tricky one to like, who, boy.

02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.680
And there are physicists who think that space is emergent

02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:16.960
but time is still fundamental

02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:19.080
and Lee Smolin is one of those scientists.

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.320
And it's really interesting to talk to him about this.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:23.160
But yeah.

02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:28.000
But time being emergent is a really trip

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:29.320
you wanted to think about.

02:11:29.320 --> 02:11:34.120
Also, I wonder if it's possible at which point

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:39.120
does the experience of time start becoming a part

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:42.640
of the conscious experience of living organisms.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.280
So is it something that evolved on earth?

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:46.120
Yeah.

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:46.960
Only, or is it-

02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.080
It's also very hard to think about consciousness

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.680
without time.

02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:52.160
And that's something that's really interesting

02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:54.080
for me to think about too.

02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.520
Although, not that this is scientific evidence of anything,

02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:01.720
but I and many others have had the experience,

02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:04.320
a timeless, spaceless experience

02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:06.960
in certain states of meditation

02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:08.880
and under the influence of psychedelics.

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:11.120
And that's still a conscious experience, would you say?

02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:12.480
Yeah, absolutely.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:14.880
But didn't you say that some aspect

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:17.360
of conscious experience is memory?

02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:18.760
It seems like that too.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:22.600
No, no, so I said an experience of being a self

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:23.800
is due to memory.

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:27.880
It seems that consciousness and time

02:12:27.880 --> 02:12:29.280
are inextricably linked,

02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.600
but I think that may be an illusion also.

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:36.640
And when I think about consciousness being fundamental

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.880
and someone like Max Tegmark,

02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:41.920
I don't know if there are other mathematicians,

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.920
I'm sure there are, he's the only one I know of

02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.920
who will talk about mathematical forms and shapes

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.480
as not just being,

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:54.840
he talks about them as being actual

02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:59.760
objects in nature that exist,

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:02.840
that are not just mathematical structures

02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.960
that we can think about,

02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.280
but any mathematical structure that comes out of the math

02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:12.080
actually exists in reality.

02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.560
And so when I think about consciousness being fundamental,

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:20.560
I think about physics and mathematics

02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:26.160
being a description of the structure of it.

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.160
And that when mathematicians say things like that

02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:30.920
or physicists say things like that,

02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:35.640
it makes sense if we're talking

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:40.640
about a conscious experience of some sort.

02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:41.880
Yeah, that's really interesting.

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:43.440
Oh, first of all, Max is great.

02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:46.440
It's, man, this is really interesting

02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:50.200
to think about like how, what is fundamental?

02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:51.040
Yeah.

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:52.600
It's a good exercise to do in general.

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:53.440
Yeah.

02:13:53.440 --> 02:13:54.760
Like to really think through it.

02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:56.680
I mean, ultimately it's a very humbling process

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:59.560
because we're probably in the very early days of,

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:01.120
well, we can't know currently, right?

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:01.960
Right, currently.

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:07.400
I mean, maybe permanently, but I remain optimistic.

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.320
Right, well, to jump around a little bit,

02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:14.120
the Google AI engineer,

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.040
I'm using the terms from the press,

02:14:17.040 --> 02:14:18.320
it's kind of hilarious.

02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:22.200
Why, is it a friend of yours?

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.680
No, it's not, no, no.

02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.840
But just, you know, the term AI is really not used

02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:29.200
amongst machine learning people.

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:30.160
Oh, I see, okay.

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:33.560
So like I'm using kind of Google AI engineer

02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:36.320
and this like sentience and chat bot

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:38.880
and like none of those words are really used

02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:41.760
by the people that actually build them.

02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.520
You know, you're much more likely to use language model

02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:49.520
versus chat bot or like natural language dialogue

02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:53.080
versus chat bot or whatever, and certainly not sentience.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.840
But that's the point, I mean, sometimes the difference

02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:59.560
between the public discourse and the engineering

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:01.040
is actually really important because engineering

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:04.280
tends to want to ignore the magic.

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.760
They don't notice the magic.

02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:11.360
Anyway, the Google AI engineer believes

02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:16.360
that the Lambda one language, natural language system

02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:20.880
achieved sentience, I don't know

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:22.280
if you paid attention to that.

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.680
I didn't. You didn't.

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.240
But the general question is, do you think a chat bot,

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:31.000
do you think a robot could be conscious?

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.600
So, I mean, this answer is slightly different

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.920
or very different depending on whether

02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.400
I kind of follow the assumption that consciousness

02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:42.200
emerges at some point in physical processing

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:47.120
or whether it's fundamental since I've just chosen

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.480
to stay on the fundamental channel.

02:15:51.800 --> 02:15:54.360
I mean, then it's kind of a silly answer

02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.640
because if consciousness is fundamental

02:15:56.640 --> 02:15:59.320
in the way I currently think about it,

02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.640
the only way I imagine it working,

02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:07.360
every physical thing we perceive

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.080
is a representation of a conscious experience.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:15.440
So, I mean, yes, it's true of everything in the world.

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:17.920
However, I would say if that's the case,

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.040
even though there's a way in which it's behaving

02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:25.680
in similar ways to a human being,

02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.800
the way it's constructed, what it is actually made of

02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:32.840
and the physics of it is so different

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:36.920
that I would expect it to have an entirely,

02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:40.800
completely non-human conscious experience.

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:44.240
And whether it even feels like a self,

02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:47.920
I think, would be a big question mark.

02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:49.960
Well, there's questions of ethics and

02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:50.800
Yeah.

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:52.880
Is it capable of suffering?

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.960
Is suffering connected to

02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:57.960
Consciousness. Consciousness or

02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:58.800
Obviously it is.

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:00.760
It's the only way you can suffer is

02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:02.080
in a conscious way.

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.800
Maybe it's not, maybe it's not.

02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:06.240
Maybe it's more connected to self

02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:08.800
than consciousness.

02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:12.880
I would say, I mean, just on my own use of these words,

02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:15.400
suffering is only something that can happen

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.200
in a conscious experience.

02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:18.840
Right, so can robots suffer?

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:23.880
If they have a, anything that has a conscious experience

02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:25.640
can experience suffering, yes.

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:29.560
But do plants suffer in the same?

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.240
So is there some level where when we construct

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.520
our morals and ethics that,

02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:42.320
is there a class of conscious experiences

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:45.680
or organisms that are capable of conscious experience

02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:48.360
that we can anthropomorphize sufficiently

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.080
such that we give them rights?

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.440
Yeah, I mean, this is not an area that

02:17:56.280 --> 02:17:57.760
I have spent, for me,

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:02.000
I have not spent a lot of time thinking about this.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.680
Most people expect that I have, it's interesting.

02:18:04.680 --> 02:18:07.880
These types of questions are much less interesting to me

02:18:07.880 --> 02:18:09.080
than the other questions.

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:11.360
And I think it's because I'm interested

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:13.160
in the physics of things.

02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.520
I'm somewhat interested, I'm definitely interested

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.720
in ethical questions for human beings,

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:21.160
but I have spent very little time thinking

02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:24.520
about the implications for other types of intelligence.

02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:30.040
I will say that I think the capacity for suffering

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:36.360
for suffering of a conscious system

02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:42.640
goes up with memory and with a sense of self.

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:48.800
So if you take, if anesthesia only erased your memory

02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:53.000
and it didn't actually make you unconscious,

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.720
you actually experienced, horrifically experienced

02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:58.600
some surgical procedure,

02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.960
but we could completely wipe out your memory of it.

02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:05.680
As nightmarish as that scenario is,

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:08.360
and I'm not suggesting we should ever do this,

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:11.480
I would say if our only option

02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.120
were to erase your memory of it,

02:19:13.120 --> 02:19:17.000
that would be the more ethical thing to do

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.120
than to have you maintain that memory

02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:22.520
because the suffering is then carried

02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.960
across a longer distance through time.

02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:30.320
That's presuming that suffering is unethical.

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.040
Well, isn't that what ethics is all about?

02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.080
It's about suffering.

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.520
I mean, I think, to me, ethics is all about suffering

02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:42.320
and wellbeing, and I don't know what ethics is without that.

02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:43.720
There's different measures of suffering.

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.080
So having one traumatic event may,

02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:48.880
if you erase that one traumatic event

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:52.680
that potentially might have negative,

02:19:52.680 --> 02:19:55.480
on-net consequences for the growth of a human being.

02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.720
Yeah, so then it's a different question,

02:19:57.720 --> 02:20:02.720
but I would say that memory increases suffering globally

02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:09.160
so that if any moment of suffering

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.880
only existed for itself in the present moment,

02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:19.240
that is a lesser kind of suffering

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:24.120
than a suffering that is drawn out over time through memory.

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.560
So hard to think about.

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:28.000
And so, yeah, I mean, in terms of AI,

02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:32.080
if they're conscious and there's a sense of self and memory,

02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.720
which I think, I actually think you need memory

02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:36.040
to have a sense of self.

02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.120
Actually, sorry, I take that back.

02:20:39.120 --> 02:20:41.880
I actually think you can have a really primitive sense

02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:43.200
of self without memory.

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:47.160
But an AI that is conscious,

02:20:47.160 --> 02:20:49.800
that has memory and a sense of self,

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:54.640
yeah, that's capable of suffering, absolutely.

02:20:54.640 --> 02:20:55.720
Well, one of the things,

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:59.560
because you said you haven't really looked into this area

02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.520
because there's so many interesting things to look into

02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:05.080
and you're really focused on the physics side.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:09.360
To me, the neuroscience experiments that you mentioned

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.760
where there's a difference between the timing of things

02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:13.600
that kind of reveal there's something here.

02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:15.760
To me, working with robots,

02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:20.600
I have robots that are moving around my home in Austin.

02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:27.000
It's a very good embodied thought experiment.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Here's the thing that looks like it has a free will.

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:37.760
It looks like it has conscious experiences.

02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:40.680
And then I know how it's programmed.

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:42.880
And so I have to go back and forth.

02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:49.680
You lay on the ground looking up at the stars

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:53.920
thinking about plants and I look at it like a robot.

02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:55.560
Well, you can do this with plants too.

02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:58.840
There's some complex enough behavior

02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:01.560
that looks like free will from a certain angle.

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:04.680
And it makes you wonder two things.

02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:08.600
One, is there consciousness associated with that processing?

02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:11.920
And two, if there isn't,

02:22:14.120 --> 02:22:17.680
what does that say about our experience?

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:22.680
And our circumstance and nature, what does that say?

02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:24.920
Yeah.

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.800
But yeah, I do that with plants all the time.

02:22:27.800 --> 02:22:28.640
I go back and forth.

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:33.280
But the zombie thought experiment now, at least for me,

02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:36.720
is often presented as AI because now that's easier,

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:39.160
as a robot, because that's easier.

02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:44.880
I don't know if it's just because it's in pop culture now

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:47.000
in the form of films and television shows,

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:52.000
but it's easier to get to that point of contemplation,

02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:58.440
I think, by imagining a robot.

02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.480
I don't know why exactly I'm bothered

02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:03.360
by philosophers talking about zombies

02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:06.720
because it feels like they're missing.

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:08.200
It's like talking about,

02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:14.840
it's reducing a joyful experience.

02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:18.320
So like, that's like talking about,

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:20.440
listen, when you fall in love with somebody,

02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:21.720
the other person is a zombie.

02:23:21.720 --> 02:23:23.680
You don't know if they're conscious or not.

02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.560
You're just making presumptions and so on.

02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:28.920
It's like, it says philosophers will do this kind of thing.

02:23:28.920 --> 02:23:30.040
They might as well be a zombie.

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:32.000
Or, you know, there's no such thing as love.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:35.840
It's just a mutual, like economists will reduce love

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.520
to some kind of mutual calculation

02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.560
that minimizes risk and stability over time.

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:43.720
It's like, all right, what I wanna do

02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:47.560
with each of those people is I wanna find

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:50.720
every one of those philosophers that talk about zombies

02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:52.600
and eventually give them one of those robots

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:54.320
and watch them fall in love

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:59.320
and then see how their understanding of how humble they are

02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:02.400
by how little we understand.

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:04.080
That's the point of the zombie experiment.

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.360
I mean, the zombie thought experiment.

02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:08.520
I mean, I can't speak for any of them.

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:10.840
Empathy for zombies, is that the point?

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:13.600
So for me, I mean, I don't like spending much time on it.

02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:15.760
I think it has limited use for sure.

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:18.520
And I understand your annoyance with it.

02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:21.600
But for me, what's so useful about it is

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:24.680
it gets you to ask the same questions you're asking

02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.240
when you're looking at robots.

02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:29.440
If you just run the experiment and you say,

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:31.560
okay, I'm sitting here with Lex,

02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:34.160
what if I try to trick myself?

02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:36.200
What's different about the world

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:40.040
if someone tells me actually he's a robot

02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:42.240
is essentially what the zombie experiment is.

02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:43.360
He's over there.

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.760
He has no conscious experience.

02:24:44.760 --> 02:24:47.920
He's acting so there's no experience there.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:49.800
So it gets you to ask some interesting questions.

02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:52.760
One is, okay, when it seems impossible,

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:54.480
I just think, no, that makes no sense.

02:24:54.960 --> 02:24:56.600
I can't even imagine that.

02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:00.440
Okay, what do I think consciousness is responsible for?

02:25:00.440 --> 02:25:04.520
What is consciousness doing in that human over there

02:25:04.520 --> 02:25:09.520
that is Lex that I can't fathom all of your behavior

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:13.280
and everything that you're doing

02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:14.800
and about without consciousness.

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:16.760
So it gets you to ask this question.

02:25:16.760 --> 02:25:19.840
These are the questions I begin my book with.

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:21.720
What is consciousness doing?

02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:24.440
It gets you to ask that question in a deeper way.

02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.040
And then I kind of found this alternate.

02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:28.320
I don't know if other people have done this,

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:31.280
but I found this alternate use for it,

02:25:31.280 --> 02:25:33.160
which is even more useful to me,

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.040
which is I'm able to do it sometimes.

02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:37.840
I'm able to just sit with someone

02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:41.480
and get my imagination going

02:25:41.480 --> 02:25:45.680
and imagine there really is no conscious experience there

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:47.320
in that person.

02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:49.480
And what happened for me the first few times

02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.440
that I was able to do this is it reminded me exactly

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.600
of how I feel when I look at complex plant behavior

02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:59.360
and other behaviors in nature

02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:02.800
where I assume there's no conscious experience.

02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:07.360
And to me, it just flips everything on its head.

02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.640
It just gets you to be able,

02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:12.280
it gets you to be open to possibilities

02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.480
that you were close to before.

02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:16.320
And I think that's useful.

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:21.320
Does it enhance or dissipate your capacity

02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:24.280
for love of other human beings?

02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:27.600
What role does love play in the human condition, Arka?

02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:32.040
I mean, in so many ways, it's the most important role.

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:36.000
I don't think any of these realizations,

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:41.920
I mean, if anything, I think it enhances it,

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:45.000
but I don't think they,

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I mean, it kind of goes back to the levels of usefulness.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.720
Sometimes you wanna picture your friends as a plant.

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:53.560
It's helpful.

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.320
It's helpful to appreciate the beauty

02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:57.880
that they are as an organism.

02:26:57.880 --> 02:26:59.320
Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.320
For me, the more time I spend practicing meditation,

02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.520
seeing through these illusions,

02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:13.600
the more poignant my conscious experience becomes.

02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:17.880
And love is obviously one of the most powerful

02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.040
and one of the most positive experiences we have.

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:23.640
And I don't know, there's just,

02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.440
whatever its cause is,

02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:28.240
there's just something miraculous about it

02:27:28.240 --> 02:27:30.880
in and of itself and for itself.

02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.920
I think love, romantic love is a beautiful thing.

02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:36.080
Connection, friendship is a beautiful thing.

02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:38.760
Connection, friendship is a beautiful thing.

02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:41.920
And it's so interesting how people can grow together,

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:44.640
how interact together, disagree together

02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:46.560
and make each other better.

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:49.360
Like scientific collaborations are like this too.

02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:52.600
I did it in Kahneman and Tversky.

02:27:52.600 --> 02:27:57.000
I mean, there's, and most people are not able to do that

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.440
in the scientific realm.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.360
They create, the more successful you become,

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:01.200
the more solid.

02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:02.040
No, it's rare.

02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:02.880
And you recognize it when you have it.

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:04.040
When you have a great collaboration,

02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:06.560
I mean, in science, but also in other areas.

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:09.000
In this TED production I'm working on,

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:12.480
I just happened to be working with this producer

02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:14.680
where we had this instant connection

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.840
and the chemistry is great

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:19.240
and I have so much fun recording with her.

02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:20.480
It's like, it's so great to have,

02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:22.840
I usually work alone and it's been wonderful

02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:23.680
to have a partner.

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:24.840
So it's like a chat,

02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:26.400
it's like a conversation type of thing?

02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:28.440
Yes, she's taking my conversation.

02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:29.280
We're playing around with it.

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:30.640
We're just working on the pilot.

02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:32.560
I love how you have no idea how it's gonna turn out.

02:28:33.200 --> 02:28:34.040
This is great.

02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:37.640
Yeah, well, I just started working

02:28:37.640 --> 02:28:42.640
without a clear image of the end result.

02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:47.000
Although it started with an idea for a film.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:48.960
I don't know, I guess I have a feeling,

02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:51.080
I was just wondering if I'd talked about this

02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:53.680
with you before anywhere, but probably not.

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:55.280
Yeah, because you and I have never spoken.

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:56.840
No, we just met.

02:28:56.840 --> 02:28:57.680
We just know each other.

02:28:57.680 --> 02:28:59.120
You mean you didn't see me when I was listening

02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.080
to that podcast of yours and had that thought

02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.920
and you didn't hear that thought?

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:05.480
I mean, we were mentioning this offline

02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:07.360
as a small tangent, there's a cool dynamic

02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:10.080
in how we get to become really close friends

02:29:10.080 --> 02:29:13.960
without never having met, never having talked one way,

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:16.360
but it could be one way friendships that form.

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:17.200
It's a beautiful thing.

02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:20.920
I think, I don't know, that makes me feel

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:23.400
like we're all connected and you're almost like plugging

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.920
into some kind of weird thing in the space of ideas.

02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:30.320
So many things I wanna say now, but here's one thing

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.920
is the way I think about consciousness,

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:37.920
if it's fundamental is analogous to a pot of boiling water

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:40.760
where the water is the consciousness

02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:43.520
and the bubbles are the conscious experiences.

02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:46.840
And so it is all one thing.

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:49.280
And then there are these shapes that take form

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:51.920
and there's a felt experience, right?

02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.120
It's all felt experience.

02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:58.120
And so when we're able to let go of this sense of self

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:03.240
or this illusion of self, the idea that experiences

02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:07.080
are happening to something or to someone drops out.

02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:10.760
And what you get is just experiences arising.

02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:13.640
So there's the fundamental nature of the universe

02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:16.720
which obviously has a structure and obeys laws.

02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:20.680
But what you get out of that are appearances

02:30:20.680 --> 02:30:22.440
of different conscious experiences.

02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:26.120
They're just coming into being, right?

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:30.160
And so there is under that view, I mean,

02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:32.360
there are different ways to look at the fundamental nature

02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:33.640
of reality without consciousness

02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:35.080
and kind of come up with a similar view.

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:39.160
But in that view, it is just kind of one,

02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:43.200
it's one thing with different experiences popping up.

02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:46.040
And in that boiling pot is a lobster

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:48.920
which represents the human condition.

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:50.240
The devil.

02:30:50.240 --> 02:30:52.120
Because life is suffering.

02:30:52.120 --> 02:30:52.960
I don't know if you've read,

02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:55.240
did David Foster Wallace consider the lobster?

02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:58.680
I mean, the stuff that they would do to lobsters

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:01.240
is fascinatingly horrible.

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:02.080
But-

02:31:02.080 --> 02:31:04.680
Oh yeah, no, I mean, that was my first rejection

02:31:04.680 --> 02:31:07.880
of many worlds, just my psychological rejection of it

02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:12.880
was just imagining the multiplication of all the suffering.

02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:16.440
I just, I mean, I spent a lot of time

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:22.160
thinking about consumed by and trying not to be overwhelmed

02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:26.120
by the depth of human suffering.

02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:28.240
Who imagine many worlds with is just-

02:31:28.240 --> 02:31:29.080
Infinite suffering?

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:29.920
Oh my God.

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:30.760
Yeah.

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:31.840
What is it about humans?

02:31:31.840 --> 02:31:34.040
I think you spent too much on Twitter.

02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:35.840
It's focused on the suffering.

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:37.520
I mean, there's also the awesomeness.

02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.720
And I think the awesomeness outpowers the suffering

02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:40.560
over time.

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:41.520
That's so nice.

02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:43.440
I wish I believed that.

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:48.440
With memory, as you said, the suffering is multiplied.

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:51.760
It's an interesting thought.

02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:56.760
But with memory, beauty is multiplied as well.

02:31:57.920 --> 02:31:58.760
So it's like-

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:03.080
Yes, where I stand with it, and I'm for some reason

02:32:03.080 --> 02:32:05.480
still optimistic that we can get ourselves

02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:08.000
to a different place.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:11.680
But the way things currently are,

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:15.080
or the way things have always been for animals and humans,

02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:18.400
and I think any conscious life form is,

02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:24.240
to me, the suffering seems so much more impactful

02:32:26.840 --> 02:32:31.040
and powerful than any happy,

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.080
for lack of a better word, experience

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:36.960
that no happy experience is worth

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:42.600
its equivalent experience of suffering.

02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:46.880
That's certainly how I feel as well,

02:32:46.880 --> 02:32:49.880
but I have learned not to trust my feelings.

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:50.840
Yeah, well.

02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:54.880
So, you know, the folks who are religious

02:32:54.880 --> 02:32:57.040
will ask the question, which I think applies

02:32:57.040 --> 02:32:58.320
whether you're religious or not,

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.360
why is there suffering in the world?

02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:02.800
Why does a just God allow suffering?

02:33:02.800 --> 02:33:04.480
Those kinds of questions.

02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:08.080
I think, I think,

02:33:09.080 --> 02:33:14.080
it does seem that suffering is a deep part of human history.

02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:22.480
And you have to really think about that.

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:23.440
It's a part of nature.

02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.280
I mean-

02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:25.120
It's a part of nature.

02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:28.840
If feeling good is surviving and thriving,

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.000
nothing survives and thrives forever.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:35.120
So you just encounter suffering, it's just built in.

02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:37.840
Yeah, death meets us all in the end.

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:41.400
And only, it's kind of hilarious

02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:43.000
to then think about most of nature

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.920
and the cruelty and the poverty of nature,

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:48.400
like how horrible the conditions are for animals.

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:49.440
And plants.

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:52.920
And it's just war, it's just all over the place.

02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:55.360
It's war, but it's mostly, yeah, it's war,

02:33:55.360 --> 02:33:59.040
but it's also just, it's like poverty.

02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:00.960
It's extreme poverty.

02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:03.640
When people criticize farms and so on,

02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:06.160
you also have to consider the suffering that animals,

02:34:06.160 --> 02:34:08.760
we try to imagine that animals in the woods

02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:09.840
are all this happy time.

02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:12.160
No, it's like, you have to really consider

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.800
if you really asked an animal,

02:34:13.800 --> 02:34:16.040
would they like to sit in a boring zoo

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:19.680
and be fed away from the wild

02:34:19.680 --> 02:34:21.600
and nature and the freedom and so on?

02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:23.520
I don't know how many of them would choose the zoo

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:24.520
versus like nature.

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:29.520
Anyway, but what's the meaning of life?

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:30.760
Let me ask the question, why?

02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:31.880
Is that a question for me?

02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:32.720
Yes.

02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.440
There's no you.

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:37.640
It's a question for whatever you're plugged into.

02:34:37.640 --> 02:34:40.600
Is that a question for the body and mind system

02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:41.440
we call Anika?

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:43.960
We call Anika and let's see what that-

02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:45.360
The meaning of life?

02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:47.840
Yeah, the why, the why.

02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:48.680
Why?

02:34:48.680 --> 02:34:49.600
Is there a why? It's interesting.

02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:52.400
I've never been drawn to the why questions.

02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:55.800
I'm interested in the what and the how.

02:34:58.520 --> 02:34:59.440
What is life?

02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:00.600
What is this place?

02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:01.560
What are we doing?

02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:02.720
How are we here?

02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:06.400
How is this taking place?

02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:09.360
But I mean, if I had to answer,

02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:13.680
I guess I don't think there is a why really.

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:16.280
It's funny, the quote,

02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:20.440
the thought that comes to mind is really

02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:21.920
like a kind of a cheesy quote

02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:25.720
that I'm sure is printed on a bunch of mugs and T-shirts,

02:35:25.720 --> 02:35:27.120
but it's Tick Not Han.

02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:29.920
I'm gonna get it wrong,

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.560
but it's something like we're here to awaken

02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:36.800
from our illusion of separateness.

02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:42.160
And I don't really see that as an answer to the why question,

02:35:42.160 --> 02:35:44.840
although that's how it's framed in his quote.

02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:47.360
It's we are here for that purpose.

02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:53.200
I think if there is a purpose worth being here for,

02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:55.800
that's kind of the ultimate, I think.

02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:59.240
Let me ask you for advice.

02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:04.240
You had a complex and a beautiful journey through life.

02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:08.400
You're exceptionally successful.

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.880
What advice would you give to young folks

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:13.000
in high school or in college

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.840
about how to live a life like yours

02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:19.680
or how to live a life they can be proud of

02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:21.520
or have a career they can be proud of,

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:25.560
how to pave a path and journey

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:28.600
they can be happy with and be proud of?

02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:31.160
I haven't really had this conversation with my kids.

02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:33.840
I mean, we have lots of deep conversations

02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:38.400
and they're all kind of pertaining to each moment

02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.120
or whatever they're facing.

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:45.960
I think career is difficult because in so many ways,

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:49.200
I just feel like I'm lucky that I ended up being able to do

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:52.800
for a living the thing I love to do.

02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:53.640
But the truth is-

02:36:53.640 --> 02:36:57.160
There's no such thing as luck with a free will.

02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:58.080
Luck is an illusion.

02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.600
There's no such thing as luck

02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:02.400
when you believe in free will, right?

02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:03.960
Right, that's true.

02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:05.520
They're all illusions.

02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.360
I really start, in retrospect,

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:14.200
started working on my book 30 years ago

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:17.160
and had no idea that I was working on a book.

02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:19.520
And this kind of ties into my advice,

02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:22.080
which is I think it's really important

02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.160
to follow your passion and

02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:33.000
to find things that you love and that you find inspiring

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:36.760
and motivating and exciting,

02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:41.080
whether they relate to your career or not.

02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:46.080
And I think many times if you persist

02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:52.040
just for the pure passion of the thing itself,

02:37:52.120 --> 02:37:57.120
it finds a way into your everyday life.

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:01.160
The career manifests itself out of whatever it persists.

02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:02.480
That's what's happened to me.

02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:06.520
I've had such an unconventional path.

02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:11.520
It's very hard for me to give advice based on that path.

02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:15.960
But I do believe that it's extraordinarily important

02:38:15.960 --> 02:38:19.920
to keep your passions alive, to keep your curiosity alive,

02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.720
to keep your wonder at life alive, however you do that.

02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:27.880
And it doesn't necessarily have to be in your career.

02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.880
And I think for a lot of people,

02:38:29.880 --> 02:38:33.800
their career enables them the time and the space

02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:38.800
to experience other things that maybe wouldn't be

02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:42.360
as enjoyable if they weren't their career.

02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:45.120
Yeah, I mean, in general, a dogged pursuit

02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:48.640
of the stuff you love will create something beautiful.

02:38:48.640 --> 02:38:51.440
And if it's an unconventional path,

02:38:51.440 --> 02:38:53.880
those are the best kind, those are the most beautiful kind.

02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:56.040
And it created in this case,

02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:59.320
I think you're a beautiful person, Anika, a beautiful mind.

02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.680
Thank you so much for doing everything you do

02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:05.520
and for sharing it with the world.

02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:07.000
And thank you so much for talking with me today.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:07.840
That was awesome.

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:08.920
Good to finally meet you.

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.000
Great to finally meet you.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.760
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Anika Harris.

02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:15.160

02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.960
And now let me leave you with some words from Mahatma Gandhi.

02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:26.480
I will not let anyone walk through my mind

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:27.800
with their dirty feet.

02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:31.760
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
