00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
But it was really shocking to me that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.400
Like for me, it was like breathing.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.320
Like you're just doing sex and you're bored and like, what do you do?

00:06.320 --> 00:07.440
I don't know. Let's try something funny.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.640
Like it's just the natural progression.

00:09.640 --> 00:12.160
And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.640
Like I would just be really creative and like immediately was the top not safe for work post on Reddit.

00:16.640 --> 00:18.840
Like I didn't even try that hard.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.440
The following is a conversation with Ayla,

00:23.440 --> 00:28.640
a sex researcher who does some of the largest human sexuality survey studies in the world

00:28.680 --> 00:31.760
on everything from fetishes to relationships.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.080
She is fearless in pursuing her curiosity on these topics

00:35.080 --> 00:38.000
by asking challenging and fascinating questions

00:38.000 --> 00:41.400
and looking for answers in a rigorous data-driven way

00:41.400 --> 00:46.400
and writing about it on her blog, knowingless.com.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.240
She's also a sex worker, including only fans and escorting

00:51.240 --> 00:56.240
and is an exceptionally prolific creator of thought-provoking Twitter polls.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.440
Ayla and I disagree on a bunch of things,

00:59.440 --> 01:03.000
but that just made this conversation even more interesting.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.600
I like interesting people

01:04.600 --> 01:09.000
in the full range of the meaning that the word interesting implies.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.160
I'm currently reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac

01:12.160 --> 01:16.440
and would be remiss if I didn't mention one of my favorite quotes

01:16.440 --> 01:18.960
from that book that feels relevant here.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.000
The only people for me are the mad ones.

01:23.040 --> 01:27.680
The ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved,

01:27.680 --> 01:30.280
desirous of everything at the same time.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.360
The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,

01:33.360 --> 01:38.360
but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow Roman candles

01:38.360 --> 01:41.400
exploding like spiders across the stars.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.760
In the middle, you see the blue center light pop

01:44.760 --> 01:46.360
and everybody goes, ah.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.320
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.400
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.360
And now, dear friends, here's Ayla.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.520
I feel like this conversation can go anywhere.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.120
Is that exciting or terrifying to you?

02:02.120 --> 02:03.400
I think it's more exciting.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.800
The uncertainty exciting to you?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.120
Yes.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.520
In conversations in general or just this one?

02:09.520 --> 02:11.120
I think conversations in general.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.240
Like, is anybody like, oh, the certainty is really exciting?

02:13.240 --> 02:14.880
Maybe if the certainty is something new.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.960
I mean, novelty always comes with uncertainty, right?

02:16.960 --> 02:18.040
Almost always.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.040
I started trying to think of a counter example.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.680
Immediately.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.640
You're uncomfortable with generalizations of that kind.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.240
Like, always is always a really bold word to use.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.280
But if it's truly novel, that means you don't really understand it.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.880
It's outside your distribution.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.480
So therefore, it's going to have a bunch of uncertainty.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.200
But you don't think of it as uncertainty.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.280
You think about it as something new,

02:37.280 --> 02:38.560
but it actually also attracts you

02:38.560 --> 02:41.160
because there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding it, probably.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.520
Like, what is this new thing?

02:42.520 --> 02:45.920
Yeah, like annihilating the mystery, like that drive.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.160
What about the danger of it?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.480
I was just thinking of it on the drive over

02:50.480 --> 02:53.480
because I was kind of like a little nervous about doing this podcast.

02:53.480 --> 02:57.440
And then I was like feeling into the unpleasantness of it,

02:57.440 --> 03:00.400
like the fear of what if something goes terribly wrong?

03:00.400 --> 03:04.240
And then I was also feeling into how much that feels like part of why it's exciting.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.160
Like, if I knew that it was going to go great, I don't know.

03:07.160 --> 03:10.760
Did you actually imagine all the possible ways it can go wrong?

03:10.760 --> 03:12.400
Not like all of them.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.400
But I was like, what if I say something really dumb?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.960
Or like you asked me a question

03:16.040 --> 03:19.880
and I answer it in a way that makes me sound like a lot less capable than I am.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.800
I'm like really afraid of being perceived as stupid or something.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.080
I was also thinking about this on the way over,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.720
like I'm kind of risk averse in some ways.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.840
Like I don't like driving fast in cars

03:28.840 --> 03:31.640
because I was driving very carefully here because the roads are bad.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.040
And then I was thinking, but I'm very like pro-risk in other ways,

03:34.040 --> 03:38.400
like being really exposed to like a wide variety of people who might hate you.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.880
And I think from the outside that might look fine,

03:40.880 --> 03:42.760
but I think the monkey brain is really sensitive

03:42.760 --> 03:47.680
to lots of people yelling at you for whatever problems that you seem to have.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.920
So that's the big risk you're taking is putting yourself out there

03:51.920 --> 03:54.480
as an intellectual, like through your writing,

03:54.480 --> 03:56.000
and then a lot of people yelling at you.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.880
Is that the worst embarrassment you've experienced?

03:57.880 --> 03:59.480
It's pretty bad, yeah.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.240
I think the worst embarrassment is if I put something out there

04:02.240 --> 04:05.560
that I failed to like be properly skeptical of in myself.

04:05.560 --> 04:09.320
And then people are like, oh, we caught this thing that you didn't catch.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.160
I think that's the biggest terror.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.400
Yeah, from looking at your reading and listening to your interviews,

04:15.400 --> 04:20.080
you seem to be very defensive and worried about being a good scientist.

04:20.080 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, definitely.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.440
Well, you're like methodology.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.280
Yes.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.560
And funny enough, you get attacked on that methodology,

04:26.560 --> 04:32.880
even though I'm a fan of psychology, like academic psychology,

04:32.880 --> 04:38.520
and it's kind of disappointing often how non-rigorous their work is,

04:38.520 --> 04:43.280
how small the sample size and so on, and how big and ambitious,

04:43.280 --> 04:46.840
over ambitious the proclamations about results is,

04:46.840 --> 04:49.560
especially with the news reports on it.

04:49.560 --> 04:54.040
Now, you're both the researcher, the scientist, and the reporter, right?

04:54.040 --> 04:56.200
So like that's what you have with the blog.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.160
Your sample size is often gigantic.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.520
The methodology is right there.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.360
The data is right there.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.000
You provide the data.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.120
And then you're like raw and honest with your interpretation of the data.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.240
There's an honesty, authenticity to it.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.000
So it's actually really refreshing.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.440
I don't know why people criticize it.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.800
I think this is what psychologists are probably terrified about being

05:18.800 --> 05:24.280
transparent in that way, is because they'll get attacked for their methodology.

05:24.280 --> 05:30.360
So they want to cloak it in a sort of layer of authority.

05:30.360 --> 05:32.160
Like I'm from this institution.

05:32.160 --> 05:35.840
It was peer-reviewed, all these layers.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.720
And I'm also not going to share the data with you.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.360
And I'm also going to pretend like most psychology studies are not replicable.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.400
I'm just going to pretend there's authority to it.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.680
I think it works on a lot of people.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.760
Like from the outside, you're like, ah, the scientists with the white lab coats

05:47.760 --> 05:50.440
with credentials, those are the people who are doing science.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.960
And doing science is, you have fancy terms that other people don't really understand.

05:55.960 --> 05:58.160
And to be fair, I have a lot to learn.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.800
I'm still self-teaching.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.520
I'm learning through people, learning as I go.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.200
I'm definitely not super knowledgeable about this stuff.

06:05.240 --> 06:10.040
But a lot of what those people are doing in science is not that hard.

06:10.040 --> 06:14.880
And a lot of people don't try to learn it because it seems so elevated.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.040
And this is one thing that really bothers me.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.320
I think everybody can do science.

06:19.320 --> 06:22.680
If you just have this aspect of curiosity and you just really want to figure

06:22.680 --> 06:26.320
something out, you can go and start asking people questions, doing surveys,

06:26.320 --> 06:27.720
writing down the answers.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.120
And then you can go learn how to look at that data in a way that gives you more

06:31.120 --> 06:32.360
information about the world.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.520
It's very simple and straightforward.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.080
If you just approach it humbly and earnestly, and you're like, please, let's

06:37.080 --> 06:38.480
figure this out together.

06:38.480 --> 06:44.680
But people are, I think, self-crippled in this because they view this as relegated

06:44.680 --> 06:48.320
to the domain of the experts and the fancy scientists.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.400
And I think that makes me feel really sad.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.160
You're almost attracted to the questions you're not supposed to ask.

06:54.160 --> 06:54.880
Oh, yeah.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.320
Also, yes.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.880
It might contribute to the controversy.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.720
Not exclusively, probably.

06:59.760 --> 07:05.880
You're just not limited by part of your curiosity asking questions that seem

07:05.880 --> 07:07.760
common sense.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.920
Some of the most controversial questions are around sex.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.400
It's like everybody thinks and talks and does sex.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.920
I mean, it's the driver of human civilization.

07:17.920 --> 07:23.360
And yet, there's so little rigorous discussion about the philosophical and the

07:23.360 --> 07:24.880
scientific questions around it.

07:24.880 --> 07:29.080
It gets really weird to be able to discuss them.

07:29.080 --> 07:30.840
It becomes tricky to discuss them.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.320
Yeah, it's supercharged.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.440
Because everybody has a really strong opinion, whether or not pornography is

07:35.440 --> 07:39.360
damaging to society, or how sex corresponds to gender, or what kind of

07:39.360 --> 07:41.720
sexuality is acceptable.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.760
Can you have sexual preferences that in themselves are immoral?

07:45.760 --> 07:47.880
People get very angry about it.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.560
Well, the sad part is they're not just opinionated.

07:51.560 --> 07:57.600
But most of us, our relationship with sex is, I guess, I want to say not

07:57.600 --> 07:58.960
rigorous.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.440
I think it's very difficult to be rigorous about sex.

08:02.440 --> 08:07.480
I would consider sexual urges to be kind of elusive to introspection in a way

08:07.480 --> 08:09.800
that's a little bit disproportionate to a lot of other things.

08:09.800 --> 08:14.560
You can introspect about how I want other people to like me and where my

08:14.560 --> 08:15.680
insecurities lie.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.040
But sex is one of those black box things.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.480
A really common thing is for people, if you have a fetish, you sort of check

08:21.480 --> 08:24.920
back in your childhood to see an event that corresponds to that fetish.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.800
And then you develop a narrative, like this event in my childhood must have

08:27.800 --> 08:29.000
caused this fetish.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.840
And so I think this causes people to be biased towards like a concrete,

08:32.840 --> 08:37.920
coherent, causative way that events happen or that sexual fetishes happen.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.280
This is just like one example of why I think it's really hard to be rigorous

08:41.280 --> 08:45.480
with introspection because we can't avoid, you just want to tend towards making

08:45.480 --> 08:48.440
like coherent narratives, which I think is not always the correct way to

08:48.440 --> 08:49.280
explain it.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.360
The narratives that are connected to childhood and so on, how they

08:52.360 --> 08:53.960
originate, yeah.

08:53.960 --> 08:56.760
I mean, we'll talk about fetishes because you have a lot of really interesting

08:56.800 --> 08:58.120
writing on that.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.320
Just actually zooming out, I should mention, you tweeted, I wrote this down.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.520
You tweeted, I do not understand how to have normal conversations with people in

09:06.520 --> 09:10.000
person if I'm not on drugs.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.760
So I guess let's both agree to not have a normal conversation, I guess,

09:14.760 --> 09:16.480
assuming you're not on drugs now.

09:16.480 --> 09:17.840
Or if you are, you don't have to talk.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.920
I feel like a very small amount of phenobite, which is a nootropic.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.040
Don't know if that counts as a drug.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.920
Well, I guess I'm on caffeine.

09:24.920 --> 09:25.320
Yeah.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.600
So we're both.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.360
Drugged up.

09:27.360 --> 09:31.000
Good enough to have a normal conversation.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.680
We don't have to.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.640
What is normal anyway?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.560
What do you think is the primary driver of human civilization?

09:37.560 --> 09:41.560
Is it the desire for sex, love, power, or immortality?

09:41.560 --> 09:46.280
Like avoiding the fear of death, constructing illusions that make us forget

09:46.280 --> 09:48.960
about our terror over mortality.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.080
So sex, love, power, death.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.760
This is a Twitter poll.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.080
It's four options.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.440
This is reality.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.760
Not everything maps perfectly to a Twitter poll.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.360
But in this case, because there's four options and it is a small number of

10:03.360 --> 10:04.640
characters, it does.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.160
But I'd like to think I'm more interested.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.520
You know what?

10:08.520 --> 10:11.480
I think your Twitter polls are fundamentally interesting.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.800
There's something about the brevity of a poll limiting to a set of choices and

10:16.800 --> 10:20.000
having an existential crisis and searching for the answer.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.320
That's beautiful.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.280
That combination.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.200
Well, this one's a big one.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.520
Like, what do you think is behind it?

10:24.520 --> 10:26.320
Do you believe that there is one primary driver?

10:26.320 --> 10:30.920
Like, do you think that it can be understood in the terms of primary drivers?

10:30.920 --> 10:34.840
Yeah, I think, well, maybe it's an engineering perspective, like trying to

10:34.840 --> 10:36.280
reverse engineer the brain.

10:36.280 --> 10:40.200
I don't think we're equipped or understanding enough about the mind to get there.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.840
Yeah, like, what's the primary driver of a tree?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.200
Yeah, well, then it gets to the question of what is life?

10:46.200 --> 10:47.760
What is the living organism?

10:47.760 --> 10:49.600
To self-replicate, probably.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.720
That's a very clean simplification.

10:51.720 --> 11:00.560
But I think life is more interesting than just self-replication.

11:00.560 --> 11:04.440
Yeah, but it sounds like there's a curiosity in you that you're trying to poke at.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.040
And I don't understand exactly what that curiosity is.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.640
So if I had to dedicate a thousand years to understand one of these topics,

11:11.640 --> 11:14.960
which one would be the most fruitful, I guess, is the indirect thing I'm asking.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.800
Fun?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.760
No, well, fun.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.440
To me, everything is fun.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.280
Really?

11:22.280 --> 11:23.280
Yeah.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.280
I mean, I'm with David Foster Wallace.

11:25.280 --> 11:30.840
The key to life is to make sure that everything is unborable or should be unborable.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.440
Or nothing is boring.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.440
Everything is fun.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.320
Like everything.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.160
I could just literally sit.

11:37.160 --> 11:40.160
I honestly, because I don't think I don't know where you got that glass,

11:40.160 --> 11:42.560
but that glass exists and I forgot it exists.

11:42.560 --> 11:45.040
It was really fun to me to know that it now is there.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.560
What about the really unpleasant things?

11:47.600 --> 11:50.920
Like if you're in deep agony.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.400
Yeah, that's fun.

11:52.400 --> 11:58.240
That's fun because it's like, I mean, yeah, heartbreak is like knowing that I'm capable of that.

11:58.240 --> 12:04.080
It's like from, you know, we're all living in the gutter,

12:04.080 --> 12:06.280
but some of us are looking up at the stars.

12:06.280 --> 12:11.560
So when you're in that gutter, for some reason, the stars look brighter, right?

12:11.560 --> 12:15.440
So like whenever you're going through a difficult time

12:15.480 --> 12:18.840
or whenever you see maybe other people being shitty to each other,

12:18.840 --> 12:22.000
it makes you like really appreciate when they're not.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.440
The contrast makes life kind of amazing.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.560
I'm reading a bunch of books.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.320
One of them is Brave New World, where they remove, you know,

12:29.320 --> 12:33.200
where they remove the ups and downs of life,

12:33.200 --> 12:36.600
partially through drugs, but over over sexualization and all that kind of stuff.

12:36.600 --> 12:43.120
And I feel like you need that, you need the ups and downs of life.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.800
The dark, you know, you need the dark to have happiness,

12:46.800 --> 12:53.360
have like a deeply intense feeling of affection towards another thing or a human being.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.520
Yeah. Yeah. So everything's fun.

12:55.520 --> 13:01.680
But fun is also a weird word to define because fun, I think for a lot of people,

13:01.680 --> 13:03.440
I guess that's why I talk about love a lot.

13:03.440 --> 13:07.080
I think I think love is a better word than fun.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.160
Because fun is like lighthearted.

13:10.160 --> 13:12.960
Love is more intense.

13:13.000 --> 13:18.240
Like, I love that glass and the water that's in it because it's freaking awesome.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.840
Like somebody made that glass, right?

13:19.840 --> 13:22.640
Like they and like not have many mistakes.

13:22.640 --> 13:28.440
And like there's and the way bends light in interesting ways and the way water bends light in interesting ways.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.280
Like I can see part of your arm through that water.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.000
That's freaking amazing.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.760
Everything is amazing.

13:35.760 --> 13:41.360
I'm with the Lego movie. Anyway, if but if like from a scientific perspective,

13:41.360 --> 13:44.480
if I were to investigate sex.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.640
I don't know why I put love in there.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.720
This is narrowed down the Twitter poll.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.240
Let's focus on the basics here.

13:49.240 --> 13:53.640
Sex, power or death, immortality.

13:53.640 --> 14:01.000
If I were to try to like from a neuroscience, neurobiology perspective or reverse engineer

14:01.000 --> 14:04.680
through building systems that focus on these kinds of dynamics,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.240
Exploring the game theoretic aspects of it,

14:07.240 --> 14:11.480
exploring the sort of cognitive modeling aspects of it.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.760
Which one would get me to a deeper understanding of the human condition?

14:15.760 --> 14:18.200
That's the question. Sex.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.080
OK, Nietzsche is the will to power.

14:22.080 --> 14:25.600
Freud and the bunch is all about sex.

14:25.600 --> 14:29.040
And then death.

14:29.040 --> 14:33.760
Liv just, Liv Burley, brilliant previous guest on this podcast.

14:33.760 --> 14:41.200
She just released a video where on her bedside was the book Denial of Death by Ernest Becker,

14:41.200 --> 14:43.840
which, of course, you would have on her bedside.

14:43.840 --> 14:51.520
But that the his whole work is that everything is motivated by our trying to escape the cold,

14:51.520 --> 14:54.960
harsh reality that we're going to die and we're terrified of it.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.160
One of the gifts and burdens.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.680
For human beings is that we are cognizant of our own death.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.200
And that terrifies us. That's the theory.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.880
And because of that, we do everything we can.

15:08.880 --> 15:13.400
We build we build empires to escape the fact that we're mortal.

15:13.400 --> 15:18.640
Wouldn't this change quite a bit for religious people then who don't believe that they're going to die?

15:18.640 --> 15:22.720
Well, they created religion. The idea there to create myths, religions.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.520
You can create religions of all kinds like.

15:25.520 --> 15:30.800
Yeah. But if this is like one of the defining things that define civilization,

15:30.800 --> 15:35.400
then we should expect to see massive differences between people who believe we're going to die and people who don't.

15:35.400 --> 15:40.160
Good. I love it. You think it like a like a scientifically here, but and they have actually answers.

15:40.160 --> 15:46.160
Like there's a whole terror management theory where they do write psychology type papers and they do actual experiments.

15:46.160 --> 15:50.360
I can mention how their methodology is interesting.

15:50.360 --> 15:54.160
They prime with the discussion of death, like they take one certain set of people.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.360
They have a conversation with them and another set of people.

15:56.360 --> 16:02.200
So they mentioned death to them before the conversation and see how that affects their the nature of the conversation.

16:02.200 --> 16:09.240
It's really interesting because death fundamentally alters the nature of the conversation, just even priming.

16:09.240 --> 16:14.720
Like reminding you that you're going to die briefly changes changes a lot of things.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.760
These kinds of priming papers usually not replicated.

16:17.760 --> 16:24.120
I just have like I feel like I've heard a bunch of priming ones that I think you have PTSD over psychology papers are not replicated.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.880
I just did one. I just did a priming experiment on my own and found it didn't have any effect.

16:28.880 --> 16:36.280
But again, can't you just give me a careless statement summarizing an entire scientific discipline of terror management theory?

16:36.280 --> 16:41.760
I don't know. Like I haven't rigorously looked at how good of it psychologically.

16:41.760 --> 16:48.160
I think it is interesting philosophically the way Freud talked about the subconscious mind philosophically.

16:48.160 --> 16:52.560
It's an interesting discussion. Then you have to get rigorous with each for sure.

16:52.560 --> 17:02.800
But the idea is that like it's not that religious people get rid of the terror of death.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.920
This is just one of the popular ways they create an illusion on top of it.

17:06.920 --> 17:13.400
That's that idea, like a myth that allows that makes it easier for them to forget.

17:13.400 --> 17:20.120
To escape that terror, but everybody else does different, different methods like.

17:20.160 --> 17:27.840
You fill your days with a capitalism has a whole religion of itself, like the rat race for getting more and more material possessions and so on.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.680
I mean, couldn't you argue it in the opposite direction?

17:29.680 --> 17:34.520
Like, let's say, assume that we're Christians here and we're like, oh, the atheists, you know, everybody has terror of hell.

17:34.520 --> 17:41.560
And the atheists invent this mythology where, you know, actually evolution is true in order to escape their terror of hell.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.800
So that doesn't feel like a persuasive argument to me.

17:43.800 --> 17:48.640
But I used to be very, very Christian and I did not have a terror of death.

17:48.640 --> 17:54.920
And then I lost my faith and then I had a deep terror of death set in for a few years and it felt very different to me.

17:54.920 --> 18:04.080
So for denial of death, I don't know if he says that it's actually possible without really a lot of work to get to the actual terror.

18:04.080 --> 18:11.480
Like, I think his claim is that in early, early, early childhood development, that's when the terror is real.

18:11.480 --> 18:21.400
And then we aggressively construct systems around it of social interaction to sort of construct illusions at the top of it.

18:21.400 --> 18:35.280
I'm doing a half-assed description of this philosophy, but it is interesting to simplify the human mind into underlying mechanisms that drive it.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.440
Yeah, I was going to say your thinking seems kind of poetic.

18:37.440 --> 18:43.120
Like the way that you're sort of handling these, these concepts feel like more like aesthetically driven.

18:43.120 --> 18:48.840
I think this theme is going to continue throughout this conversation as we talk about relationships and sex, yes, for sure.

18:48.840 --> 18:58.280
I think so. And I think your thinking seems to be very driven by how can I construct an experiment to test this hypothesis?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.240
Yeah, something like that.

19:00.280 --> 19:08.080
Yeah, but aren't there some things, especially that have to do with the human mind, that are really messy, really difficult to understand.

19:08.080 --> 19:13.360
There's so many uncertainties and mysteries around that we don't yet have the tools to collect the data.

19:13.360 --> 19:24.320
Like one of your favorite tools is the survey, is asking people questions and then figuring out different ways to indirectly get at the truth because there's flaws to the survey.

19:24.320 --> 19:28.920
You kind of learn about those flaws and you get better and better at asking the right questions and so on.

19:28.920 --> 19:32.280
But that's not that's indirect access to the human mind.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.720
But do you think like poetic narratives are?

19:34.720 --> 19:37.080
I'm not like saying poetic narratives are bad.

19:37.080 --> 19:42.840
Like I think it's like a cool way of like handling concepts, but I'm not sure that they are more rigorous.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.120
No, no, no. OK.

19:44.120 --> 19:52.200
No, but like they might be the more correct, like philosophy might be the right way to discuss things that were really far from understanding.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.560
Yeah, I mean, they might be more useful shorthand.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.160
Yeah.

19:55.160 --> 20:02.120
Like morality, I don't think morality makes any sense, but it's really useful shorthand to use when handling concepts in a lot of the time.

20:02.120 --> 20:06.160
Right, like ethics and morality, you could construct studies that ask different questions.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.320
Like, you know, just having worked with autonomous vehicles a lot, the the trolley problem gets brought up.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.840
And I don't know, you can construct all kinds of interesting surveys about the trolley problem.

20:16.840 --> 20:23.240
But does that really get at some deep moral calculus that humans do?

20:23.240 --> 20:31.080
It's sexy because people like write clickbait articles about it, but doesn't really get to like what you value more.

20:31.080 --> 20:35.920
Five grandmas or like three children, whatever.

20:35.920 --> 20:42.480
They construct these arguments of like if you could steer a train, if you could steer an autonomous car, which do you choose?

20:42.480 --> 20:46.840
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it's possible with some of those to construct.

20:46.840 --> 20:53.040
Sometimes the fuzzy area, there's some topics that are fuzzy and will forever be fuzzy.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.560
Given our limited cognitive capabilities.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.840
I don't know, there's a way of looking at things where it's like, for example, the childhood fetish thing that I was talking about,

20:59.840 --> 21:01.000
like where do your fetishes come from?

21:01.000 --> 21:04.920
Like you can develop a narrative where it's like, you know, I think like this kind of thing is, you know,

21:04.920 --> 21:08.440
when you're surrounded by feet when you're a child, this causes foot fetishes.

21:08.440 --> 21:11.280
And this is like kind of a cool narrative.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.760
And I think a lot of people's ideas about philosophy follow the same sort of thing.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.720
Like, what is the narrative that is cool?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.200
And I think this is useful for meaning making.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.320
Like I'm very pro meaning making.

21:20.320 --> 21:27.800
Like when you're talking about everything is fun because, you know, the contrast or whatever, I very much ascribe to that.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.920
I really enjoy that philosophy.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.800
I also find everything to be very delightful.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.600
But and this isn't like a question of truth, right?

21:34.600 --> 21:37.600
We're not like, where is the true delight that we're objectively measuring?

21:37.600 --> 21:43.080
Like this is a frame, a poetic frame that you're using to like sort of change the way the light hits the world around you.

21:43.080 --> 21:49.640
And that's super useful because it like makes you happier or something.

21:49.640 --> 21:53.960
Yeah, but also gets to the truth or something.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.720
Yeah, I guess what is the truth?

21:58.720 --> 22:01.560
Yet another question. What is truth?

22:01.560 --> 22:09.640
You've actually to jump back, you don't believe you believe that free will is an illusion.

22:09.680 --> 22:18.240
So why does it feel like I'm free to make any decision I want?

22:18.240 --> 22:19.840
It's a cool illusion.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.600
I think it's probably like where a sense of identity comes from.

22:22.600 --> 22:27.680
Like when you really meditate on your sense of identity, at least for me, it seems like it comes down to the sense of choice.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.600
Like, oh, I am doing the thinking.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.120
Like, what does it mean to do with thinking?

22:31.120 --> 22:37.320
It's like something in me has exerted agency over having this thought or not having this thought.

22:37.320 --> 22:39.720
Like the sense of self really comes down to choice.

22:39.720 --> 22:44.200
And so when I say that like free will is an illusion, I also mean there's something like the self is an illusion.

22:44.200 --> 22:47.720
Identity is a trick of the light.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.280
But it's a really fun one.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.120
You think a lot about your identity.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.000
I have occasionally.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.800
Yeah, like you really struggle with it.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.840
You're proud of it. I do, too.

22:58.840 --> 23:03.280
It's not we have different journeys, but so I really take a lot of delight in it.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.880
I used to be very into like deconstructing it.

23:05.880 --> 23:10.040
Like, maybe, you know, I did a bunch of like way too much LSD for a while.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.720
And at that point, very no ego.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.400
And now I'm like very ego.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.840
I really enjoy having a lot of ego.

23:16.840 --> 23:20.360
I actually happen to know like everything about you.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.240
Really? Yeah.

23:21.240 --> 23:22.480
Like more than you do.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.280
It's interesting.

23:23.280 --> 23:23.800
That's fascinating.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.280
Wait, could you solve my problems?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.120
Yes, all of them.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.720
I did thorough research.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.360
OK, what is consciousness then?

23:32.360 --> 23:33.480
I actually wrote that as a quote.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.800
What is consciousness?

23:36.800 --> 23:38.120
To remind myself.

23:38.120 --> 23:42.920
So like, how does that tie in together with free will and identity and all of that?

23:42.920 --> 23:46.400
Does it mean what is consciousness is like one of the biggest questions ever?

23:46.400 --> 23:49.640
I think I do think that people often get confused when talking about consciousness,

23:49.640 --> 23:52.760
because I think people are referring to two separate concepts and often like

23:52.760 --> 23:54.320
combining them into one thing.

23:54.320 --> 23:57.800
Like we asked the question, you know, is AI going to be conscious?

23:57.800 --> 23:59.640
I think this is kind of the wrong question.

23:59.640 --> 24:06.120
Like we can identify signs of consciousness, like, ah, they seem to refer to themselves.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.760
But this is not necessarily proof of consciousness in the same way that like

24:08.760 --> 24:13.280
dream characters acting exactly the way normal human people do in your dream

24:13.280 --> 24:16.160
is not evidence that they themselves are conscious.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.720
So like signs of consciousness are not proof of consciousness.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.520
But there is something that we definitely know, which is like I currently am conscious.

24:22.520 --> 24:28.800
I can tell because, right, like I'm like just directly observing my experience.

24:28.840 --> 24:32.400
And so like there's one kind of consciousness, which is I am directly observing my experience

24:32.400 --> 24:33.640
and that you cannot replicate it.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.480
Like I cannot observe two experiences.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.280
It is necessarily singular and it is necessarily certain.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.440
Like you can make all the arguments you want.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.400
Like I'm still directly observing.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.360
It's not a thing that's subject to reason.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.080
Whereas are other things conscious?

24:47.080 --> 24:48.360
This is something that's replicable.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.920
Like you can apply it to multiple people.

24:50.920 --> 24:54.240
It's something that's not certain, like almost definitionally not certain.

24:54.240 --> 24:57.520
Like we don't actually know if there is, you know, an internal experience.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.040
So my argument is that like when people are talking about other things having experience,

25:01.040 --> 25:04.600
they're using a different concept than the thing that they're actually looking at

25:04.600 --> 25:05.960
when they look at their own experience.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.360
I think they're two different things.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.040
Definitionally not possible.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.160
No, if you understand the mechanism of consciousness,

25:13.160 --> 25:14.920
you'll be able to measure it probably, right?

25:14.920 --> 25:16.440
Yeah, but what are you measuring?

25:16.440 --> 25:18.600
Like I think this is like a subtle difference.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.000
Like when you're asking the question, is this other thing conscious?

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, the easy thing to measure is like a survey.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.360
Does this thing appear conscious?

25:26.360 --> 25:27.120
Yeah.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.800
And then the hard thing is you understand the actual mechanism

25:29.800 --> 25:34.920
of how consciousness arises in the physics of the human brain.

25:34.920 --> 25:36.440
You can do that in a dream, presumably.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.080
Like if you had a very good dream or a very good simulation.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.040
But we could then have somebody in a simulation or a dream

25:42.040 --> 25:44.080
where they go through and they fully understand, you know.

25:44.080 --> 25:47.880
They do all the tests and the tests come back exactly the way you'd expect them to.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.880
But from the outside, we're like, well, this is misleading.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.720
They're not actually conscious.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.040
Like your dream characters aren't conscious, right?

25:54.040 --> 25:56.200
I don't know. Are you asking? Are you telling?

25:56.200 --> 25:59.240
I'm like appealing to an intuition.

25:59.240 --> 26:01.120
But it sounds like you're driving towards the narrative.

26:01.120 --> 26:04.080
I don't you did a poll about men and women and dreams.

26:04.080 --> 26:04.840
Yeah.

26:04.840 --> 26:05.960
There was some kind of difference.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.760
I couldn't tell what the difference was, except that more men and women.

26:08.760 --> 26:11.800
Quite a lot more women dream vividly than men.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.520
Oh, which I actually found my chaos survey.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.040
So I did a survey.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.800
Maybe, you know, that I've had.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.960
I know everything. You know, yes, I'm sorry.

26:18.960 --> 26:22.200
So as you clearly know, I'll try not to talk down to you to this conversation.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.840
I'm sorry. And I not only know everything,

26:24.840 --> 26:29.440
I know how your future looks like and how everything ends.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.120
Yeah. So you could probably win all the prediction markets on my life.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.320
Yeah. Cool.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.120
So we should also mention that you have like prediction markets.

26:36.440 --> 26:40.200
You have like votes that you what's the site called again?

26:40.440 --> 26:41.960
Manifold Manifold.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.280
And one of them was, will I be on the Lex Friedman podcast?

26:45.280 --> 26:47.120
Yeah. And I voted.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.720
I invested everything I own into the yes.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.680
Is there such thing as insider trading on there?

26:52.800 --> 26:54.760
Does that goes against the terms?

26:54.760 --> 26:57.640
No, I think insider trading is part of the information.

26:57.640 --> 26:58.920
So it's supposed to be.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.760
And then I realized it's actually public information that I voted

27:01.760 --> 27:04.040
because I think my face shows up.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.560
There's like, damn it.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.920
It's going to influence.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.320
You could make the fake account or I could be lying, right?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.680
Yeah, that's true. And then dump the stock.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.800
You know, I try to manipulate.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.520
Somebody made a market like, is Ayla going to post a poll

27:16.520 --> 27:18.920
spelled P-O-L-E on her Twitter, like a photo?

27:19.320 --> 27:21.280
And I was like, I'm going to manipulate this market.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.520
So I like fucked around with it and I voted no.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.680
And then I accidentally posted a photo of a poll without thinking.

27:26.920 --> 27:28.880
Oh, that's like self-sabotage.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.520
I accidentally fucked up my own market.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.360
That's like the reverse of insider trading.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.960
Yeah. What were we talking about?

27:35.960 --> 27:38.200
The women and the men and the difference, the vivid dreams.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.680
And the markets.

27:40.680 --> 27:41.480
I forget what the market.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.840
Oh, because I can I can perfectly predict your future.

27:44.080 --> 27:44.920
Then it's not fun.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.240
I like the romance of unpredictability.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.960
And so I like to even though I know everything,

27:49.960 --> 27:52.440
I like to forget everything.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.920
Very, very Buddhist of you.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.000
Yeah, the river.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.480
No, no man in the river wants whatever the footsteps however that goes.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.480
One of my favorite questions is like, if you could press a button

28:01.480 --> 28:03.640
and then have all of your wants fulfilled, anything that you want.

28:03.840 --> 28:07.120
So it's like such a rapid degree that you don't really experience the want.

28:07.120 --> 28:11.640
Like as the want arises, it then is like completed as immediately

28:11.640 --> 28:13.520
so that you are completely without want.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.520
Like, would you would you press that button?

28:15.520 --> 28:16.680
100% not. Yeah.

28:16.680 --> 28:19.600
I didn't think you would. No, no, no, no.

28:19.680 --> 28:22.200
Because immediately everything starts being fun.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.600
The first is only fun the first time.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.040
But if you want it to be fun.

28:25.040 --> 28:26.840
But like, what would be my source of fun?

28:26.840 --> 28:31.600
I feel like I would like on day four, just to get off, I would need to like

28:32.280 --> 28:36.120
do like nuclear war because it will escalate quickly.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.720
I feel like if everything is possible,

28:41.720 --> 28:45.680
I assume you mean like something that like is not just normal human things.

28:45.880 --> 28:46.600
Magical world.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.520
Magical world.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.200
Then you start escalating really quickly.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.440
Like, I wonder, I'll probably do like,

28:52.440 --> 28:56.440
I want everybody to just fly into the air and hover in the air.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.200
Everybody.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.120
And then you're like, oh, life is meaningless.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.000
Like, why does like you go?

29:04.000 --> 29:09.080
I feel like you get no, actually, that'd be a really interesting experiment.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.960
Like, what are the limits?

29:10.960 --> 29:13.680
Like, are we all capable of becoming psychopaths essentially?

29:14.680 --> 29:18.280
Like, I like to believe not.

29:18.440 --> 29:22.240
There's a very hard limits on that, like in our own mind,

29:22.520 --> 29:26.320
like a basic compassion, because I love being compassionate towards other human

29:26.320 --> 29:29.160
beings. And it's one of the things I think about if you give me power,

29:29.160 --> 29:31.400
like a lot of power, like absolute power.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.640
And I think that's the power you mentioned is the scariest kind of power,

29:35.800 --> 29:39.360
because it's like it's not even power in this normal world.

29:39.400 --> 29:42.080
It's like magical power where you lose.

29:42.720 --> 29:46.160
It's a dream world power where you like video game power.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.960
You don't even think of it as reality.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.560
You could just mess with the world.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.320
I feel like that's terrifying.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.960
Yeah, you basically be God. God.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.600
Yeah. But without like.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.920
I feel like the idea of God was like,

29:59.920 --> 30:03.600
can I keep things like functioning properly?

30:03.960 --> 30:06.680
But then you'd probably if you wanted to keep them functioning properly,

30:06.680 --> 30:08.800
yeah, then it would rapid.

30:08.800 --> 30:11.080
Like you would never experience a time where you're like, oh, no,

30:11.080 --> 30:12.480
that was a mistake.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.680
Because as soon as you like before you even experience that,

30:14.680 --> 30:17.080
the world would shift to to match it.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.040
Oh, interesting.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.960
Now, I think I would actually I take it back.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.960
I think I would regret the first time I hurt somebody.

30:24.160 --> 30:28.000
See, in my visualization was like a video game where everybody's like NPC,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
really dumb.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.120
Now, I think the first time I witness pain from anybody,

30:33.360 --> 30:34.680
that's when I would stop.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.920
And I would probably run into that very quickly.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.520
Like, like even just the hovering, make a person hover.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.160
And they're going to be probably really upset with the hovering.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.080
Right. And so I'm going to be like, no, don't do that anymore.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.920
And then I'll probably go to honestly, I'll just return back to my normal life.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.480
Yeah, that's kind of what I feel like.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.200
Like if I had the power to do anything,

30:56.200 --> 31:00.880
I think I would probably want to have a life very similar to where I am now.

31:01.280 --> 31:02.760
Yeah. Yeah.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.080
I mean, there's it's like with Uber,

31:04.080 --> 31:06.560
like probably more convenient to do certain things.

31:07.640 --> 31:11.320
But even then, like the struggle, like I got a flat tire.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.640
So I have to fix that.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.680
I kind of the flat tire makes.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.800
Makes everything more beautiful.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.320
It's like, cool, I could do like a normal manual thing.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.480
But also it makes you like appreciate your car, appreciate transportation,

31:25.480 --> 31:28.200
appreciate the convenience, the transportation, all of it.

31:28.560 --> 31:32.000
I know some people who would call this a bunch of copium,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.440
like you're just sort of making do with what you have.

31:34.680 --> 31:38.600
We wouldn't go back to Amish times or like pre-technology

31:38.600 --> 31:42.360
because to like in order to make ourselves appreciate things more.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.400
And so this seems like a hindsight reasoning,

31:45.800 --> 31:48.400
which I can appreciate that argument, but I don't know.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
Anyone who uses, sorry to interrupt the word copium in their

31:53.520 --> 31:57.600
in their argumentation, I think it's sus.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.920
It's sus. Yeah, it's sus.

31:59.920 --> 32:01.800
My entire argument is no.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.560
No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry.

32:03.560 --> 32:04.680
Go ahead. Sorry.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.600
I interrupted rudely the flow of thought.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.040
But you say you don't think so.

32:10.520 --> 32:13.760
In part, you disagree with that kind of argument.

32:13.760 --> 32:17.800
Yeah, because I think people have this idea that if you

32:18.560 --> 32:21.480
like come to accept or like find meaning in what you have now,

32:21.480 --> 32:23.680
this is sort of at odds with trying to improve it.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.960
And I don't find this to be the case.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.880
I find like the attempt to improve it to also be part of it.

32:30.520 --> 32:34.040
Like, I enjoy the fact that there's something like problematic going on

32:34.040 --> 32:37.400
because now I get the experience of like striving to make it go away.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.840
And like that in itself is where the meaning lies.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.960
It's not just that things are bad, it's that there's things are bad

32:41.960 --> 32:44.280
and we're trying to stop it and also.

32:44.280 --> 32:45.040
Exactly.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.800
There's if you combine that with a sense of optimism that the future can be better.

32:48.800 --> 32:53.360
Yeah, that feeds feeds into this productive effort of making things better.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.960
And it somehow makes the vision of the things that are better, more intense.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.520
Having experienced shitty things, yeah.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.120
So we talked about free will and consciousness

33:07.120 --> 33:10.680
and what drives human civilization, question left unanswered.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.000
It's a homework problem for the reader. OK.

33:17.200 --> 33:20.280
Let's like a scoreboard at the end, the amount of questions

33:20.680 --> 33:23.720
that they answer successfully versus not like polls.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.560
Can we talk about some practical things? Sure.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.920
So one of the many amazing things, I think of you as a researcher,

33:31.640 --> 33:33.120
but you've also been.

33:35.120 --> 33:36.720
Do research in the field.

33:36.720 --> 33:42.800
Yeah, fieldwork, fieldwork, a jink at all of your sex work.

33:43.800 --> 33:49.640
How did you get what's the the short and the long story of how you got into sex work?

33:49.640 --> 33:50.920
How did I get into sex work?

33:50.920 --> 33:55.400
Well, I mean, there's a whole like childhood thing where I was conservatively homeschooled.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.320
Do you want to actually talk about your childhood?

33:57.320 --> 33:59.320
I think it's interesting because you also worked in a factory.

33:59.320 --> 34:04.040
It's like your childhood is really fascinating and difficult, traumatic.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.680
So and you've written about it.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.360
There's a lot of ways we could talk about it, but maybe.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.720
What are the things you remember?

34:14.200 --> 34:17.800
The good and the bad of your childhood, of your maybe interaction with your father?

34:18.600 --> 34:21.400
Yeah, my dad probably has narcissistic personality disorder.

34:21.400 --> 34:24.920
And so it was very difficult for me to get into sex work.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.600
It was very centered on very controlling childhood, immensely so.

34:29.160 --> 34:33.000
We were homeschooled and pretty isolated from the outside world,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.320
like we didn't know anybody else who wasn't homeschooled.

34:35.880 --> 34:39.800
We went through a program called Growing Kids God's Way, which was very,

34:39.800 --> 34:42.680
it's like the kind of program where you're not supposed to pick up babies when they cry

34:42.680 --> 34:44.520
to train them that they can't manipulate the parents.

34:45.080 --> 34:49.400
Because like baby crying was viewed as like you're just teaching them from an early age

34:49.400 --> 34:52.440
that they're allowed to make the parents do what the kids want.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.360
And we're very against this philosophy.

34:54.360 --> 34:59.240
So that combined with a narcissistic personality disorder dad was pretty rough.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.720
So controlling?

35:01.720 --> 35:02.840
Super controlling, yeah.

35:02.840 --> 35:06.040
And developing and feeding the self-critical aspect of your brain?

35:06.600 --> 35:07.320
Yeah, very much.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.080
I was like lazy, but I was never going to accomplish anything in life.

35:11.080 --> 35:14.760
I was going to move out of the house and realize how good I had it at home, the classic stuff.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.800
He was very logical and smart though.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.840
And so he'd also teach us logic stuff.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.360
I remember some of my earliest memories are him like giving me basic logic puzzles.

35:24.360 --> 35:29.240
Like the dog has three legs, you know, how many dogs have four legs and I would mess up.

35:30.360 --> 35:34.120
But he was a evangelist, basically a Christian evangelist.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.840
So we did like Bible study five nights a week.

35:36.840 --> 35:41.160
I memorized I think 800 verses of the Bible by the time before I became an adult.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.480
Yeah, and it was very patriarchal also.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.840
So I was expected to grow up and become a housewife basically.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.680
They're like, oh, you can go to college to meet a man.

35:50.680 --> 35:53.320
And also to get a little bit of education so that you can homeschool your own kids.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.160
Like we were explicitly told that women were subordinate to men

35:58.280 --> 36:00.280
in regards to like making decisions when you're married.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.080
Our pastor's daughter was not allowed to leave home

36:03.080 --> 36:05.640
because she would be outside of the authority of a man.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.400
So when she got married, she was allowed to leave

36:07.400 --> 36:11.720
because she was never allowed to live in a house where she was not under a hierarchy.

36:11.720 --> 36:13.800
So this is like the kind of culture that we live.

36:13.800 --> 36:17.880
So there's a hierarchy and there's a gender aspect to the hierarchy.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.120
There's men at the top of the hierarchy.

36:20.120 --> 36:20.680
Men at the top.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.640
Okay, but your own psychology, your own mind.

36:25.480 --> 36:30.440
So most of that self-critical brain is bad, right?

36:30.440 --> 36:33.400
It's confusing because he told me that I was smart, but also that I would fail.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.840
But not smart enough, right?

36:36.840 --> 36:38.280
Or like smart, but not smart enough.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.600
Smart, but like not virtuous or something.

36:40.600 --> 36:42.120
Okay, so okay, right.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.560
There's always a flaw.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.400
There's always a flaw.

36:45.400 --> 36:49.480
I think a lot of it was a lot of the fucked upness of my brain came from feeling like

36:49.480 --> 36:54.840
I didn't have the authority to think because it was so carefully suppressed.

36:55.960 --> 37:00.280
My ability to express or have any sort of power was just absolutely annihilated.

37:00.280 --> 37:04.840
Systemically, psychologically, they would do psychological torture mechanisms to make sure

37:04.840 --> 37:10.360
that I wasn't actually thinking on my own or being able to deviate from anything anybody

37:10.360 --> 37:13.320
ever told me to the degree that it still ingrained in me.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.520
I once was a friend we were traveling and he wanted me to hop a turnstile.

37:16.520 --> 37:17.800
It was very late at night.

37:17.800 --> 37:20.840
The train was here and I could not physically force myself to do it.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.120
He was yelling at me like, come on, do it.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.680
I was trying so hard to make my body cross the line and it was just

37:27.640 --> 37:31.800
embedded in my physical being to be unable to do stuff like that, which is really annoying.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.920
You're not free to take action in this world?

37:34.920 --> 37:35.720
Yeah, some of them.

37:37.080 --> 37:41.640
That was, I think, the most annoying part of my upbringing.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.640
Would you classify it as suffering?

37:46.600 --> 37:48.280
At the time, yeah, definitely.

37:48.280 --> 37:54.040
Well, it's confusing because when I was a child, it was just painful in the sense that things suck,

37:54.040 --> 37:55.560
but it was placed in a meaning framework.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.720
It is good, it is virtuous to submit to your parents and do what they want.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.520
If they tell you to say goodbye to your best friend forever and never talk to them again,

38:02.520 --> 38:04.680
you go do that without complaining.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.760
I would go do something like that and it would suck.

38:08.760 --> 38:13.480
It really was concretely painful, but it was also placed in this narrative where I was

38:13.480 --> 38:15.000
fulfilling some sort of greater purpose.

38:15.480 --> 38:15.980
True.

38:17.080 --> 38:21.080
It's very confusing to refer to it as suffering because there's so many painful things we do

38:21.080 --> 38:24.920
today that are placed in the narrative of greater purpose that I think I would agree with.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.080
I go get a medical procedure done and that sucks, but I'm like, ah, this is helping me

38:29.080 --> 38:29.720
in the long run.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.240
Say if I got abducted to an alien planet and they're like, by the way, all of those

38:33.240 --> 38:37.080
medical procedures you got done, you didn't have to get them done, those are totally

38:37.080 --> 38:38.920
unnecessary, then I might get really upset about it.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.880
Yeah, I would trust those aliens though because they probably want to do different

38:41.880 --> 38:42.600
medical procedures.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.100
This is true.

38:45.960 --> 38:52.280
I saw a thumbnail for a video that I'm proud of myself for not clicking on about a man

38:52.280 --> 38:54.200
who's claimed that he had sex with aliens.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.920
You're proud of yourself for not clicking on that?

38:56.920 --> 39:03.160
Because I would probably watch it for like 20 minutes and then I should be doing work.

39:03.160 --> 39:03.660
Oh, I see.

39:03.820 --> 39:12.700
So like, and I'm actually happy because I get to imagine all the different possibilities

39:12.700 --> 39:14.780
that could have been for that man who had sex with them.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.900
Did you have like a really high resting happiness state?

39:17.900 --> 39:18.620
Yes, yeah.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.380
It's probably like a mushroom state, yeah.

39:21.020 --> 39:21.580
Wow.

39:21.580 --> 39:22.860
Do you do mushrooms?

39:22.860 --> 39:24.220
I've done mushrooms before.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.900
It was very awesome, but like more intensely awesome.

39:28.860 --> 39:35.820
But like, because I was just looking at nature, it makes nature even more beautiful, I think,

39:35.820 --> 39:37.900
but it's already pretty beautiful.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.180
I haven't done MDMA.

39:41.100 --> 39:42.940
People say that I should.

39:42.940 --> 39:44.060
It's very nice, yeah.

39:44.060 --> 39:44.780
Yeah.

39:44.780 --> 39:48.460
Anyway, but I'm already, yeah, what did you call it?

39:48.460 --> 39:50.060
Resting happiness state?

39:50.060 --> 39:51.820
Yeah, high resting happiness.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.540
Yeah, that's a good way to describe it.

39:54.540 --> 39:59.180
But it's not like some of it is genetic that you're able to notice the beauty in the world

39:59.180 --> 40:04.860
and some of it is practiced where you realize focusing on the negative things in life,

40:07.180 --> 40:13.660
like unproductively, it just doesn't help your mind flourish.

40:13.660 --> 40:17.900
So like you just notice that and it's like, I mean, I think people with like depression

40:18.700 --> 40:23.500
learn that or like probably with trauma too is like there's certain triggers.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.420
Like if you're, if you suffer from depression,

40:26.060 --> 40:28.700
you have to kind of constantly know there's going to be triggers that will

40:29.820 --> 40:31.260
force you to spiral down.

40:31.260 --> 40:32.540
And so just avoid those triggers.

40:32.540 --> 40:35.100
Some people have that with diet, with food and so on.

40:35.100 --> 40:39.820
And so I just don't like whenever there's shady things happening or shady people,

40:41.100 --> 40:44.060
unless I can help, unless I can somehow help.

40:44.060 --> 40:45.420
Like why focus on it?

40:45.420 --> 40:45.920
Yeah.

40:46.380 --> 40:51.180
Anyway, back to your upbringing.

40:51.180 --> 40:54.940
What was the journey of escaping that?

40:57.500 --> 41:03.180
Well, I left home like kind of early because my dad and I were not getting along by the time I was a

41:03.180 --> 41:06.140
teenager, but I still Christian for a while.

41:06.140 --> 41:11.260
And I lost my faith after I think I moved away and I started having friends that weren't religious

41:11.260 --> 41:14.300
or like weren't raised in this super conservative environment that I came from.

41:14.860 --> 41:19.180
And I think this was not conscious at the time, this is my hindsight story,

41:19.180 --> 41:23.980
but I believe that like being exposed to a culture in which I had the capacity to believe,

41:23.980 --> 41:27.580
like allowed my brain to actually seriously consider the thought that maybe

41:27.580 --> 41:29.420
all of this stuff was untrue.

41:29.420 --> 41:33.180
That I had been taught like 6,000 year old earth and evolution is a lie,

41:33.180 --> 41:35.580
you know, macro evolution and all of this stuff.

41:36.860 --> 41:39.980
Because like when you're, when you're immersed in an environment like that,

41:39.980 --> 41:41.980
I don't think you actually have a choice.

41:41.980 --> 41:45.660
Like your brain has to believe these things because this is a survival thing.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.220
Like if you believe this, you'll be like, if you believe the wrong thing,

41:48.220 --> 41:49.740
you'll be totally cast out.

41:49.740 --> 41:53.420
Even if they're not going to cast you out, you're going to be cast out in like communion with others

41:53.420 --> 41:56.860
because we were always told that you can't like trust non-believers really.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.540
They don't have a moral compass.

41:58.540 --> 41:59.980
They're going to screw you over.

41:59.980 --> 42:03.340
And so I'm like, oh, I can't be that like everybody's going to outcast me internally.

42:03.900 --> 42:08.060
So anyway, I wasn't, I don't think I actually had the capacity to seriously question my faith,

42:08.060 --> 42:10.300
even though I thought that I was questioning it quite hard

42:10.300 --> 42:13.180
until I got into an environment where it was safe to do so.

42:13.180 --> 42:17.020
And once I started being able to make friends who were not religious, I'm like, oh, if I lose my

42:17.020 --> 42:19.340
faith, I'm still going to have some sort of community.

42:20.380 --> 42:23.580
And then at that time I went through some questioning and then I lost my faith.

42:24.940 --> 42:28.220
So in that, given your friends, given your situation, you have,

42:28.860 --> 42:30.860
you now have the freedom to think essentially.

42:31.740 --> 42:35.260
Or at least the ability to think of something that was acceptable in the new culture, yeah.

42:37.020 --> 42:42.380
Without, I mean, is there a danger of like adopting the beliefs of the new culture?

42:43.260 --> 42:47.500
So like there's some aspects of just being able to think freely,

42:47.500 --> 42:50.460
which you weren't able to do when you were growing up, just to think,

42:51.180 --> 42:54.460
like look at the world and wonder how it works, that kind of thing.

42:55.500 --> 42:59.020
I mean, you work it within certain boundaries, like there are certain basic assumptions.

42:59.740 --> 43:03.260
And as long as you were following those basic assumptions, which is to be fair,

43:03.260 --> 43:04.380
it's like kind of what we're doing now.

43:04.380 --> 43:07.740
Like we have, have I gone and done the personal research that like

43:07.740 --> 43:09.100
evolution is the thing that's going on?

43:09.100 --> 43:10.540
Have I looked at like the age of the stones?

43:10.540 --> 43:11.020
No, I haven't.

43:11.020 --> 43:11.980
I'm trusting other people.

43:12.780 --> 43:16.620
Which I think is like a fair choice to make, given where I'm at right now.

43:16.620 --> 43:20.940
But you're also assuming like there's causality in the universe, time is real,

43:22.060 --> 43:26.700
that like, that first of all, the thing that your senses are perceiving is real.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.180
You're assuming a lot of things.

43:30.460 --> 43:33.740
Yeah, I think like it's better just to become aware of the assumptions you're making,

43:33.740 --> 43:35.980
like as opposed to not making those assumptions at all.

43:35.980 --> 43:37.660
Like you have to assume something.

43:37.660 --> 43:41.580
And I did, it's very suspicious, right, that I went out of this very conservative culture.

43:41.980 --> 43:45.260
Well, I guess I don't believe things that are super in line with the current culture.

43:45.260 --> 43:49.020
I think this is why I feel a little bit safer right now, because like when I was Christian,

43:49.020 --> 43:50.700
I believe generally Christian things.

43:50.700 --> 43:53.100
But now I believe a bunch of things that like people really hate,

43:53.100 --> 43:54.700
like I get canceled online all the time.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.340
I'm like, okay, this is a sign that maybe you're thinking independently,

43:57.340 --> 44:00.780
if you're like able to think things that are completely at odds with the people around you.

44:00.780 --> 44:04.780
And to be fair, this is a little bit easier to do when it's like general culture,

44:04.780 --> 44:06.460
but it's much harder to do with your peer group.

44:06.460 --> 44:09.740
Like the people that you trust, your friends, the people whose opinions you respect,

44:09.740 --> 44:14.060
like disagreeing with those people is very difficult and I'm not very good at it.

44:14.620 --> 44:20.380
Yeah, I do think that if you establish yourself as a person who can be trusted

44:20.380 --> 44:22.860
and is a good human being, you have a lot more freedom

44:23.820 --> 44:27.020
to then explore ideas that are different from your peer group.

44:27.660 --> 44:31.660
So like those seem, if you separate the space of ideas versus

44:32.380 --> 44:34.780
some kind of like deeper sense of what this person is,

44:35.740 --> 44:40.380
like that they're an interesting and trustworthy and good human being.

44:40.380 --> 44:45.660
Well, like is there somebody that you respect who you consider significantly smarter than you?

44:45.660 --> 44:51.180
And can you imagine believing an idea that you've heard them talk really disdainfully about?

44:52.060 --> 44:55.100
Like how would you feel coming to me like I believe this thing that you find to be?

44:56.300 --> 44:57.420
Yeah, I do all the time.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.060
Oh yeah?

44:58.060 --> 44:58.700
Yeah.

44:58.700 --> 44:59.740
You may be braver than me.

45:01.500 --> 45:03.260
And to be fair, I support doing this.

45:03.260 --> 45:08.860
Like I try to do this, but I think like subconsciously I notice that I don't do it as much.

45:08.860 --> 45:10.220
And so I'm suspicious of myself.

45:10.220 --> 45:12.780
I'm like, oh, I wonder if I'm hiding to myself

45:12.780 --> 45:16.060
like actual curiosity about things that might deviate from my peer group

45:16.060 --> 45:18.380
because I noticed that I'm not actually deviating with them

45:18.380 --> 45:19.820
as much as I do with the outside world.

45:19.820 --> 45:20.380
That's interesting.

45:20.380 --> 45:23.660
I mean like because I do see most people I interact with as smarter than me,

45:23.660 --> 45:27.500
but I also have this intuitive feeling that dumb people,

45:27.500 --> 45:29.820
which I consider myself being, have wisdom.

45:29.820 --> 45:34.380
So like in the disagreement, actually, I also believe in the power of conversation

45:34.380 --> 45:36.380
and in the tension of disagreement.

45:36.380 --> 45:41.580
So I think even just disagreeing from a place, from a good place,

45:41.580 --> 45:45.100
from a place of like love and respect for each other,

45:45.100 --> 45:47.180
I think I just believe in that.

45:47.180 --> 45:49.820
So it's not like individuals, you're disagreeing.

45:49.820 --> 45:54.300
You're like working towards arriving at some deeper truth together, right?

45:54.300 --> 45:57.660
Even if the other person is smarter.

45:58.620 --> 46:01.340
Maybe that's how I justify it for myself.

46:01.340 --> 46:05.900
I'm also a fan of conversations because I've seen, just listening to conversations,

46:06.780 --> 46:13.980
it seems like a great conversation more emerges from it than the sum of its parts, right?

46:13.980 --> 46:20.780
Like somehow two people together can do, like that dance of ideas can somehow create a cool thing.

46:20.780 --> 46:25.180
By the way, I enjoyed, I saw a video of you dancing at a bar drunk.

46:25.180 --> 46:25.980
At a bar drunk.

46:27.820 --> 46:28.860
It wasn't a bar drunk.

46:28.860 --> 46:31.260
It didn't look drunk, but just the dancing.

46:31.260 --> 46:32.780
It was like ballroom dancing type of thing.

46:34.060 --> 46:35.180
Something like that.

46:35.180 --> 46:37.580
I've been doing a bit of tango dancing.

46:37.580 --> 46:38.300
I like it.

46:38.300 --> 46:38.860
Argentine?

46:39.900 --> 46:40.620
Nice.

46:40.620 --> 46:44.700
I like stuff with the body in general, like wrestling or combat.

46:44.700 --> 46:46.380
Usually when there's a tension,

46:46.380 --> 46:50.940
you have to understand the mechanics of how two bodies move when they're in conflict.

46:50.940 --> 46:54.620
And dancing is similar.

46:55.580 --> 46:59.900
Like you have to do rapid thinking also, like rapid intuitive physical thinking.

46:59.900 --> 47:01.500
And that's my favorite kind of thing.

47:01.500 --> 47:05.740
Like a lot of exercise is really boring to me because you can just do it while your brain's off.

47:05.740 --> 47:08.700
But something like ballroom dancing or fusion dancing,

47:08.700 --> 47:11.900
you have to constantly be figuring out, like it's a rapid puzzle.

47:11.900 --> 47:12.860
And that's so wonderful.

47:12.860 --> 47:13.820
What's fusion dancing?

47:13.820 --> 47:15.100
That's the video.

47:15.100 --> 47:17.340
Fusion dancing is like, if you have any sort of dance background,

47:17.340 --> 47:19.420
you can come and you just kind of mix those together.

47:19.420 --> 47:19.820
Oh, just kind of improvise.

47:19.820 --> 47:23.420
You can have people doing ballet with people doing ballroom with people doing blues.

47:23.420 --> 47:23.820
Cool.

47:23.820 --> 47:27.100
And then there's an interesting dynamic because there's, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,

47:27.100 --> 47:30.300
but there's, that's very meta.

47:30.300 --> 47:31.820
There's usually a lead and a follow.

47:32.860 --> 47:34.380
I guess most dances have that.

47:34.380 --> 47:34.860
Yeah.

47:34.860 --> 47:35.180
Yeah.

47:35.180 --> 47:39.020
And so that, but both have a different, like you both have to be quite sensitive

47:39.020 --> 47:41.260
to the other human being, but in a different way.

47:42.380 --> 47:42.940
Yeah.

47:42.940 --> 47:43.580
It's interesting.

47:44.140 --> 47:44.380
Yeah.

47:45.260 --> 47:48.620
So I like both that there is that definitive role,

47:49.420 --> 47:55.420
but also like, it's not somehow that one is better than the other.

47:55.420 --> 47:57.340
There's an interesting tension between the two.

47:57.900 --> 48:01.980
Yeah, it's good because it's like a basic rule set that allows for a ton of expression.

48:02.620 --> 48:06.220
I've recently started to experiment with like reverse leading.

48:06.220 --> 48:07.260
It's not like back leading.

48:07.260 --> 48:09.580
It's like, I don't know, like sometimes I'll like

48:11.100 --> 48:12.620
So you can lead as a follow.

48:12.620 --> 48:13.580
Oh, you can lead.

48:13.580 --> 48:17.660
When I'm, when I'm typically following I'll like occasionally throw in a little lead here and there.

48:18.220 --> 48:19.660
But don't you kind of follow it?

48:19.660 --> 48:20.220
Oh, I see.

48:21.740 --> 48:25.820
Don't you hit hint at a lead when you're following?

48:26.540 --> 48:31.500
Like don't you just by the dynamics of your movement, you're not perfectly following.

48:31.500 --> 48:36.060
I mean, cause it is like the lead is listening to your body, right?

48:36.060 --> 48:36.700
Yeah.

48:36.700 --> 48:41.100
So like, you're kind of both figuring out what you do next.

48:41.100 --> 48:41.580
That's true.

48:41.580 --> 48:43.260
I'm a very good follow though.

48:43.260 --> 48:43.660
Okay.

48:43.660 --> 48:46.060
So I'm like, I'm like, I'm an invisible follow.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.580
You do have movements like I.

48:47.580 --> 48:48.300
Oh, interesting.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.260
I'm not like good at technique.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.300
I didn't know those existed.

48:50.300 --> 48:51.180
Like a perfect follow.

48:51.180 --> 48:52.620
You seek a perfect follow.

48:52.620 --> 48:53.580
I'm really ideal.

48:53.580 --> 48:55.900
I'm not great at technique and sometimes I'll fall over.

48:55.900 --> 48:58.060
But like with the following part, I'm very good at it.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.100
Do you enjoy following?

48:59.100 --> 48:59.340
Yeah.

48:59.340 --> 48:59.740
Yeah.

48:59.740 --> 49:00.300
It's really nice.

49:01.260 --> 49:03.580
Again, like it's a very fast physical puzzle you have to solve.

49:03.580 --> 49:04.140
It's like typing.

49:04.140 --> 49:05.180
I really like typing.

49:05.180 --> 49:07.660
That's why I was inquiring about your keyboard earlier.

49:07.660 --> 49:08.940
Why do you like typing?

49:08.940 --> 49:13.340
Because it's like the very fast, like the really rapid response was reaction time.

49:13.340 --> 49:15.340
I like things that like have very fast reaction times.

49:16.060 --> 49:16.700
Games like that.

49:17.900 --> 49:21.100
But typing is not a reaction or is it the brain generating words?

49:21.100 --> 49:22.780
And then you're like, how's typing a reaction?

49:22.780 --> 49:22.940
Okay.

49:22.940 --> 49:26.700
The sensation that I get when I am typing is the kind of thing that I'm trying to point out.

49:26.700 --> 49:29.420
So maybe, maybe reaction time isn't the quite, I don't know what the term is,

49:29.420 --> 49:30.780
but whatever that thing is.

49:30.780 --> 49:32.540
Like the thing where you have to like look at a word

49:32.540 --> 49:34.620
and then communicate it into your fingers.

49:34.620 --> 49:34.940
Yeah.

49:35.980 --> 49:36.940
It feels like dancing.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.380
Like you're responding.

49:38.380 --> 49:39.500
You're responding to your brain.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.140
Your fingers are doing the responding to the brain that generate the words.

49:43.180 --> 49:45.340
Making your body do what your brain wants it to do.

49:45.340 --> 49:47.020
But like fast and precisely.

49:47.020 --> 49:49.020
Well, then you might not like this Kinesis keyboard

49:49.020 --> 49:51.660
because it makes the, it makes it easier to do that.

49:51.660 --> 49:53.660
You probably like the struggle, right?

49:55.020 --> 49:59.020
It looks hard because you have, it looks like it's high depression on the keys.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.620
No, it's, well, oh, I see.

50:00.620 --> 50:00.940
Yes.

50:02.220 --> 50:05.980
More than like a laptop keyboard, but like that you don't have to,

50:05.980 --> 50:09.420
one of the main things is you don't have to move your fingers at all.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.020
So like, so like, for example, a lot of people that,

50:13.100 --> 50:15.740
I think they have a backspace up in the top right corner.

50:15.740 --> 50:15.980
Yeah.

50:15.980 --> 50:18.060
So if you have to make mistakes, which is like,

50:19.900 --> 50:21.900
I mean, that's like so metaphorical.

50:22.860 --> 50:25.980
Every mistake you have to like really hurt yourself for.

50:25.980 --> 50:28.540
You have to like stretch for the backspace.

50:28.540 --> 50:30.300
There's that poetic narrative again.

50:30.300 --> 50:33.340
It's like it emanates like a lot of your perspective.

50:33.340 --> 50:34.380
Everything.

50:34.380 --> 50:34.860
Yeah.

50:34.860 --> 50:35.360
No.

50:37.420 --> 50:40.460
Yeah, I don't, and I see it as a good thing.

50:41.260 --> 50:46.140
Like a romantic element permeates my interpretation of the world.

50:46.140 --> 50:46.380
Yes.

50:47.020 --> 50:49.420
But you left home early.

50:51.580 --> 50:54.060
How did you end up working at a factory?

50:54.060 --> 50:55.900
Well, I tried to go to college, but failed.

50:55.900 --> 50:56.700
Couldn't afford it.

50:57.580 --> 50:58.220
Did you like it?

50:59.980 --> 51:01.820
I remember it just being really slow.

51:01.820 --> 51:04.060
I remember being shocked that the teachers didn't care.

51:04.620 --> 51:07.100
Like I was used to homeschooling.

51:07.100 --> 51:07.600
Yeah.

51:08.400 --> 51:11.200
And where, I don't know, it just like meant something.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.960
It felt like the people around me that were teaching me,

51:12.960 --> 51:15.120
because we had like a mom's group also,

51:15.120 --> 51:16.960
like directly cared about what I was learning.

51:16.960 --> 51:18.880
And I would be able to ask questions and they would like really respond.

51:18.880 --> 51:19.600
What's a mom's group?

51:20.400 --> 51:21.520
It was like a homeschooling group.

51:21.520 --> 51:24.320
So we're a bunch of moms who are homeschooling their kids get together

51:24.960 --> 51:26.080
and then teach each other's kids.

51:26.960 --> 51:27.760
Oh, cool.

51:27.760 --> 51:28.400
Yeah.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.800
And they have different like interests and capabilities and so on.

51:30.800 --> 51:31.520
And they kind of.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.520
And sometimes if some of the kids are really good at something,

51:33.520 --> 51:36.080
you have like the older kids teaching the other ones too.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.960
So it was very like everybody kind of figures out what they could good at

51:38.960 --> 51:41.040
and they share that skill set with everybody else,

51:41.040 --> 51:42.320
which I think was a pretty great setup.

51:42.320 --> 51:44.960
Honestly, I think my childhood kind of sucked in a lot of ways,

51:44.960 --> 51:47.920
but homeschooling was excellent for me,

51:47.920 --> 51:49.840
mainly because it just had so much free time.

51:49.840 --> 51:52.320
Like I was just did like two or three hours of school

51:52.320 --> 51:54.560
and then did whatever the fuck I wanted for the rest of the day.

51:54.560 --> 51:58.080
And I got to actually pursue skills that are still useful for me to this day.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.880
Even in that constrained environment?

52:01.360 --> 52:04.400
Like I wrote, I've read fantasy books and I wrote so much.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.800
And now I'm now I'm writing a lot from my blog.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.920
So what kind of fantasy books, like sci-fi type stuff?

52:10.480 --> 52:18.640
My classic, like I read like Mercedes Lackey and the E.E. Knight and Arcelor Le Guin and.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.680
I don't know any of this.

52:19.680 --> 52:20.320
What is this?

52:20.320 --> 52:20.960
What is it?

52:20.960 --> 52:22.000
Is it like a romantic thing?

52:22.000 --> 52:23.200
Is it like, is it romance?

52:23.200 --> 52:25.360
All the fantasy books, like dragons.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.320
Oh, dragons.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.600
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

52:27.600 --> 52:29.600
You didn't mention Tolkien for the fantasy.

52:29.600 --> 52:30.320
I read Tolkien.

52:30.320 --> 52:30.800
Okay.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.360
Yeah.

52:31.360 --> 52:31.600
All right.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.560
Well, it's beautiful.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.720
So you threw all the dragons.

52:36.480 --> 52:37.520
How did you end up in a factory?

52:37.520 --> 52:38.240
You try school.

52:38.240 --> 52:38.560
Yeah, yeah.

52:38.560 --> 52:39.200
Try school.

52:39.200 --> 52:40.400
Had a job out for a couple of months.

52:40.400 --> 52:41.920
And then I was like, well, I'm poor.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.800
And I was ready to take any job.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.000
I was like applying for sewer jobs.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.600
And then I got a factory.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.240
I'm like, all right, let's do it.

52:48.240 --> 52:50.480
Because my parents know no financial help at all.

52:50.480 --> 52:53.120
They're like, you pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, you know.

52:54.400 --> 52:57.280
So anyway, I went to work at a factory and that sucked ass.

52:57.280 --> 52:57.920
Do not recommend.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.000
We had to wake up like 4 a.m.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.680
You know, work on weekends too.

53:03.120 --> 53:03.920
Florescent lights.

53:03.920 --> 53:04.640
It was terrible.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.240
And so I did that for about a year.

53:06.240 --> 53:08.560
And I was like, I was trying to grip my teeth and be like,

53:08.560 --> 53:09.920
this is my life, right?

53:09.920 --> 53:11.600
I didn't have high expectations for my life.

53:11.600 --> 53:14.000
I was just like, I thought like if you get a job

53:14.000 --> 53:15.440
where you don't have to be on your feet all the time,

53:15.440 --> 53:17.040
that you're living a good life.

53:18.400 --> 53:21.200
And then I got another job briefly as a photographer

53:21.200 --> 53:21.920
and then they fired me.

53:21.920 --> 53:23.120
I think I was 19 at the time.

53:24.080 --> 53:24.720
Fired you for?

53:25.920 --> 53:30.160
I was just too young and really, really bad at interacting

53:30.160 --> 53:32.240
with people in the outside world.

53:32.480 --> 53:34.000
I was pretty well socialized as a homeschooler

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
with other homeschoolers, but in the outside world,

53:36.000 --> 53:38.880
especially with all of the like hierarchy submission stuff

53:38.880 --> 53:41.360
beaten into me, like literally beaten into me,

53:41.360 --> 53:43.600
it was very difficult for me to interact with other people

53:43.600 --> 53:44.800
who were like older than me

53:44.800 --> 53:46.240
or had any sort of confidence at all.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.960
So they hired me to do like photography for people

53:48.960 --> 53:52.640
and then I was rapidly turned out that I was bad at this.

53:52.640 --> 53:53.680
And so they fired me.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.280
But at that point I'd left my factory job.

53:55.280 --> 53:57.120
I'm like, I can't go back to the factory.

53:57.120 --> 53:58.720
So I tried, I had some savings

53:58.720 --> 54:00.240
and I slept on friends' couches

54:00.240 --> 54:03.040
and I tried various self-employment stuff.

54:03.040 --> 54:06.320
I'm like, maybe I can do product photography or something.

54:06.320 --> 54:08.080
But it's Idaho, you know, nothing.

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
And if you're like a 19-year-old with no experience

54:11.120 --> 54:14.000
in the outside world at all, it was really difficult.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.920
And so I had a friend recommend

54:15.920 --> 54:17.920
that I try becoming a cam girl.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.040
So that's how it started.

54:21.040 --> 54:21.840
What is camming?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.360
What is being a cam girl?

54:23.360 --> 54:26.640
Camming is like you talk to the camera live

54:26.640 --> 54:27.760
on the computer, like you livestream.

54:27.760 --> 54:28.800
It's kind of like Twitch.

54:28.800 --> 54:30.000
And then people are typing in the chat

54:30.480 --> 54:31.040
do this stuff.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.800
And then the people can tip you money

54:32.800 --> 54:34.160
and then you can do things in response.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.920
Like, oh, if you tip me a hundred tokens,

54:35.920 --> 54:37.920
I'll take my shirt off or something like that.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.880
And like what's the, what site were you using at that time?

54:40.880 --> 54:41.600
My free cams.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.040
My free cams?

54:43.040 --> 54:44.400
Is that a popular site?

54:44.400 --> 54:45.280
It's pretty popular.

54:45.280 --> 54:49.200
Okay. And how did, what were the next steps?

54:49.200 --> 54:50.320
Like, did you enjoy it?

54:51.200 --> 54:52.400
Oh, well, it was the first time

54:52.400 --> 54:54.000
I had actual control over my life.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.880
And I made like actual real money.

54:56.880 --> 54:59.040
And so I just exploded into it.

54:59.040 --> 55:00.880
I thought about it nonstop.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.000
I was streaming all the time.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.920
I was like coming with like new creative things.

55:03.920 --> 55:05.600
And the thing is like, I don't know.

55:05.600 --> 55:07.600
There's something about public school that

55:07.600 --> 55:09.600
I ended up living in a house of cam girls

55:09.600 --> 55:11.040
full of other girls who had gone to public school.

55:11.040 --> 55:12.800
And I don't know how much of it's genetic

55:12.800 --> 55:13.840
or like just because I'm weird

55:13.840 --> 55:15.280
or is it because of our upbringing.

55:15.280 --> 55:17.680
But I felt like I was much more fearless

55:18.240 --> 55:20.640
and much more weird and creative online

55:20.640 --> 55:21.440
than other people were.

55:21.440 --> 55:23.360
Not because they weren't awesome people,

55:23.360 --> 55:24.720
but because I think like public school,

55:24.720 --> 55:26.400
I got the impression based on them talking about it

55:26.400 --> 55:27.600
that it sort of like beats out

55:27.600 --> 55:28.880
any sort of deviance from you.

55:29.760 --> 55:30.560
Like-

55:30.560 --> 55:33.520
More so than your, because I got the-

55:33.520 --> 55:35.280
We had moral deviance was beaten out.

55:35.280 --> 55:36.640
But like you could do whatever-

55:36.640 --> 55:37.520
Creative deviance was not-

55:37.520 --> 55:39.120
Creative deviance wasn't so much.

55:39.120 --> 55:42.560
Like I didn't have other kids making fun of me ever.

55:42.560 --> 55:44.160
I didn't, I don't think I'd ever heard an insult

55:44.160 --> 55:45.920
about my physical appearance as a child

55:45.920 --> 55:47.360
or a teenager once.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.960
So your father was basically saying

55:48.960 --> 55:50.560
you're not good enough was intellectual.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.880
Oh, no, that was like moral failing.

55:52.880 --> 55:53.680
Moral failing.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.200
Yeah, like I was not virtuous.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.960
Oh, wow.

55:57.200 --> 56:01.360
In various ways, like you're lazy and mostly the lazy part.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.000
I have like ADHD or something.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
And I was not good at it as a kid either.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.480
I would just totally forget all the time.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.160
Is there some sexual repression aspect to that?

56:13.280 --> 56:14.480
You know how they say that there's-

56:15.600 --> 56:16.640
It's not just homeschooling,

56:16.640 --> 56:18.560
but just like Catholic girls and so on.

56:18.560 --> 56:19.920
Just because like there's moral,

56:19.920 --> 56:22.320
you're forbidden to do certain things.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
There's a kind of liberating feeling of saying

56:25.280 --> 56:27.680
like basically rediscovering yourself,

56:27.680 --> 56:31.040
rediscovering your freedom by doing just

56:32.400 --> 56:35.280
diving head in, head first into sexuality,

56:35.280 --> 56:36.560
into your own sexuality.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.600
Is there some aspect to that?

56:37.600 --> 56:39.280
Yeah, absolutely to some degree.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.600
I think that like people kind of model it slightly wrong.

56:41.600 --> 56:43.280
Like I think there's a truth to it.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.040
But when I first got out of the house,

56:45.040 --> 56:47.440
for me freedom was like going outside at 2 a.m.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.600
Or like eating chocolate,

56:50.320 --> 56:52.720
on days that I previously wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.

56:52.960 --> 56:56.400
That was like a really intense expression of rebellion for me.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.400
And I think people don't think of this.

56:58.400 --> 57:01.200
Like I got out a lot of my intense rebellion

57:01.200 --> 57:02.720
through things that people don't typically consider

57:02.720 --> 57:03.680
to be rebellious at all.

57:03.680 --> 57:04.000
Sure.

57:04.000 --> 57:04.880
Like I wore a bikini.

57:05.440 --> 57:05.680
Yeah.

57:06.400 --> 57:06.880
Insane.

57:07.760 --> 57:11.200
I just like walked around in it and like I can do this.

57:11.200 --> 57:12.400
Yeah, basically.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.920
And so like this was most of that emotional processing for me.

57:16.480 --> 57:19.280
And it took me a couple years from leaving home

57:19.280 --> 57:21.840
and all of that conservative culture into doing sex work.

57:22.080 --> 57:25.280
In the meantime, I did try having sex with a lot of people.

57:25.280 --> 57:28.480
But this was mainly because I didn't know what the norms were.

57:28.480 --> 57:29.920
I didn't really understand.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.440
I was just like, okay, take things logically.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.040
Take things one step at a time.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.600
And I'm like, okay, if the whole previous set

57:35.600 --> 57:37.360
about like how I'm not supposed to kiss somebody

57:37.360 --> 57:38.880
until the altar of marriage,

57:38.880 --> 57:40.960
if that's not the way that things are supposed to go,

57:40.960 --> 57:43.040
then what is the way things are supposed to go?

57:43.040 --> 57:44.560
And I was like, well, if I am aroused,

57:44.560 --> 57:46.000
I should go have sex with someone, right?

57:46.000 --> 57:46.880
Is there any reason not to?

57:46.880 --> 57:47.120
No.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.480
So I would go around asking random people to have sex with me.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.960
Did you have any peer pressure saying like,

57:52.960 --> 57:55.360
that's not good or that is good or like any,

57:55.360 --> 57:58.000
did you feel any currents of society in any direction?

57:59.440 --> 58:01.600
Or are you independently just thinking like,

58:01.600 --> 58:03.120
from first principles?

58:03.120 --> 58:06.240
I think, I mean, I'm not saying it was a totally a clean thing.

58:06.240 --> 58:08.800
I'm sure that I was experiencing society telling me this is bad.

58:08.800 --> 58:09.680
But you have to know,

58:09.680 --> 58:11.600
I wasn't watching normal movies when I was a teen.

58:12.240 --> 58:15.680
We watched Christian movies, the stuff that we watched was filtered.

58:15.680 --> 58:18.400
I watched the Titanic and I had no idea that Jack and Rose had sex

58:18.480 --> 58:20.560
because it was put through a filtered-

58:20.560 --> 58:21.440
Wait, did they?

58:21.440 --> 58:23.760
Yeah, they went and, you know, he'd painted her naked and-

58:23.760 --> 58:24.240
Yeah, yeah.

58:24.240 --> 58:27.200
There was a scene in a car on the ship.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.160
On the car? Oh, on the ship.

58:28.160 --> 58:31.120
Yeah, they had like cars in storage and there's a hand.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.880
I watched it again later and I was like, oh my God.

58:32.880 --> 58:34.400
I don't remember the sex scene.

58:34.400 --> 58:38.240
Well, maybe were you also put through a filtered version?

58:39.440 --> 58:41.120
Maybe it's the filter I see like,

58:41.120 --> 58:43.120
did the couple in the notebook also have sex?

58:43.120 --> 58:46.160
Because maybe for romantic movies, I focus on the romance.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.960
Maybe, right?

58:48.960 --> 58:51.920
And the sex scenes are always like weirdly filmed in these-

58:51.920 --> 58:52.320
Yeah.

58:52.320 --> 58:55.520
Because it's never, I mean, it doesn't,

58:55.520 --> 58:57.040
it feels more like romance than sex.

58:58.240 --> 59:00.400
I guess that's the main focus of this, right?

59:00.400 --> 59:01.840
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.320
Yeah, anyway, so they had sex, it's good to know now.

59:04.320 --> 59:04.640
They did.

59:04.640 --> 59:06.400
I'll go back and watch now to fact check.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.960
You have your own personal filter on your brain.

59:08.960 --> 59:13.280
And once you realize that the foundation of your beliefs

59:14.000 --> 59:15.840
were wrong, then everything might be wrong

59:15.840 --> 59:17.840
that you kind of just doing from first principles.

59:19.040 --> 59:21.280
And again, like not totally separate from culture,

59:21.280 --> 59:23.680
but also I think in general, I also have a predisposition

59:23.680 --> 59:26.160
to just be like, you know, fuck what culture tells you,

59:26.160 --> 59:28.480
just figure out what's right for you and do it.

59:28.480 --> 59:29.920
And so that mixed with, you know,

59:29.920 --> 59:31.680
the figuring things out from first principles.

59:31.680 --> 59:33.840
I did eventually figure out that I didn't like

59:33.840 --> 59:36.960
having casual sex with just anybody quite as much.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.960
So I stopped that, but it took me a while to figure that out.

59:38.960 --> 59:40.480
What's the negative of casual sex?

59:40.480 --> 59:42.240
It's just like not good.

59:42.240 --> 59:44.640
I mean, if you like figure out the chemistry

59:44.640 --> 59:47.200
you have with someone better, then it can be a lot nicer.

59:47.200 --> 59:48.160
But I wasn't doing that.

59:48.160 --> 59:50.560
I was just like somebody I met and I'm like,

59:50.560 --> 59:52.400
do you seem kind of cute?

59:52.400 --> 59:52.720
Okay.

59:53.360 --> 59:55.920
Like I didn't bother to try and develop any chemistry.

59:55.920 --> 59:56.400
I mean, I didn't know.

59:56.400 --> 59:58.160
Chemistry even outside of sex, just chemistry,

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.240
like human chemistry, like conversation.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:00.480
Yeah.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.440
Okay.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.520
I would, I would, it's like kind of cringy,

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.080
but I would like walk up to guys or send them messages.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.000
Like, would you like to have coitus?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:08.880
That's what I would say.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.680
You would say coitus.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.640
I had said that.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.040
I mean, it's kind of, it's kind of cute in a way.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.800
I mean, it's a girl asking you to get laid.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.080
So they probably didn't care that much.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.600
But anyway, I'm saying that like I had a lot of rebelling

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.440
out of my system by the time I started sex work.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.880
So like for me, I'm like, maybe I'm sure it was somehow related

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.800
because we were extremely sexually repressed growing up.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.400
I remember the day I learned I had a vagina,

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.680
which was absolutely horrifying.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.600
Do not recommend figuring out you have another orifice in your body.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.040
But like-

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.560
Do you want to share the process of you figuring out that you had a vagina?

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.160
They told me I had a vagina.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.840
Oh, like intellectually, like there was somebody said you have a vagina.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.480
Vagina, yeah.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.520
And that was horrifying to you.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:51.920
Yeah. I didn't know I had, because you weren't supposed to ever like touch

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.880
or look at yourself ever.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:53.760
So I never did.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.120
It was just really disgusting.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.040
And so I had no idea that what was going on in my genital region.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.400
And so one day my mom sat me down.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.520
I think it was like nine or 10.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.520
And she was like, you have a, there's another?

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.020
What?

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.660
And you're going to bleed out of it.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.860
It's what she told me.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.140
You're going to bleed out of it for a while.

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.060
And I was like, what the fuck, mom?

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.580
I didn't know what the word fuck was.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.660
But I would have said that if I had known.

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.100
When did you first learn the word fuck?

01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:24.980
Oh, I think I learned it when I was at a playground

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.700
and it was written somewhere and I read it out loud.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.460
And then a kid next to me started giggling.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.740
Did you ever, did you say fuck again for a while?

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.540
No, I think the next time I said, I swore the first time I was 18.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.980
Like intentionally said a swear word when I was 18.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.700
Did you feel good?

01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:43.700
I was like really nervous.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.980
What's your favorite swear word?

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.300
I mean, fuck's pretty good.

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.260
Yeah, fuck's pretty good.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:48.760
Yeah.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.580
Okay, so that's camming.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.140
I mean, what are the pros and cons of camming

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.220
and how does OnlyFans map into this?

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.220
Did you switch to OnlyFans at some point?

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.260
I did, yeah.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.620
I came for like five or six years and I burned out eventually.

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.660
What are the good aspects?

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:06.180
What are the bad aspects of camming?

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.740
Well, the good aspects were that it was just your own terms.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:09.700
You get to decide.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.460
Everything about it is under your control,

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.060
which I loved at the time.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:13.780
I was like, I can work.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.980
When I want, how I want, any sort of expression I experimented.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.940
And I was very successful.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.140
I was making around $200 an hour,

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.700
which for that website at the time was like pretty good.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.580
I had elaborate routines as a mime.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.340
I would do like dress up as a mime and then dress up a chair

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.460
and I would seduce the chair.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:30.900
Oh, cool.

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.620
Yeah, or like.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.660
Was there an artistic element to it almost?

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:35.940
Yeah, very much.

01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:37.140
Did you talk to the chair?

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.420
You had gnomes?

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.060
No, I was a mime.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:39.940
You don't.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.980
Oh, sorry.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.380
Right.

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.420
Yeah, get us straight, dude.

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.500
You know what I really appreciate about you is

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.340
I'm asking some really dumb questions

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.020
and you're answering it in a very intelligent way.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.820
So I appreciate that.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:54.740
All right, did you ask the chair questions?

01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.940
I was a mime, you fucking idiot.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.580
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:04.180
But there's gnomes on the, like big gnomes or small gnomes?

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.300
Like lawn gnomes.

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.620
Lawn gnomes and you seduce the lawn gnomes on the chair,

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.660
the gnomes sitting on the chair.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.180
There were some, yeah, gnomes on the chair.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.980
I did a photo set which I submitted to Reddit

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.020
where I got abducted.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.340
I was like stripping, taking my clothes off

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:17.700
and then slowly the gnomes surrounded me

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.300
in the background and dragged me off.

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.420
And I did this as a photo set.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:21.220
Consensually?

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:25.140
I mean, I didn't feel consensual in the photos, but.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.460
But it was the 11th top post of the gnomes.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:31.540
It was very successful on Reddit, basically.

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.660
It was the top post on Gone Wild

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.740
and the 11th top post of all time on Reddit.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.580
Which I think probably just means it's artistic,

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.820
it's interesting, it's edgy, it's funny,

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.020
so it's really, really well done.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:42.900
But it was really shocking to me

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.980
that nobody else was doing anything creative with sex work.

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:46.500
Like for me, it was like breathing.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.860
Like you're just doing sex and you're bored.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.420
I'm like, what do you do?

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:49.540
I don't know, let's try something funny.

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.780
Like it's just the natural progression.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.180
And it felt to me like there was almost no competition.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:55.620
Like I would just be really creative

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:57.620
and like immediately it was the top,

01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.820
not safe for work post on Reddit.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.140
Like I didn't even try that hard.

01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.740
And so it's really shocking to me

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.140
that other women who are doing this sort of thing.

01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:07.220
Is that still a little bit of the case?

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.020
Like that there's not as much like,

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:13.140
because from my sort of outsider perspective,

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.340
that seems to be still the case.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.420
Like there's not, like as you describe it,

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:17.780
that's kind of cool.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.340
That's like almost like playing,

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.260
like having fun with sexuality almost.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:22.760
Yeah.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.020
Yeah, but that does require kind of thinking through.

01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:28.820
It's almost like a creative project,

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.300
like a photography project or something like that.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.540
Almost like a little skit movie.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.340
It's interesting.

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.140
It's this vibe of like,

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:37.700
how can you like bring like vibrant novelty

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.380
to whatever you're doing, anything you're doing.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.140
And I really like doing this with surveys too.

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.820
Like I've been doing a lot of standard surveys,

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:44.020
but I'm also like experimenting

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.780
with novel creative artistic surveys.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.620
I'm like, how do you ask a question

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:49.460
in a way that's like beautiful and unusual?

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.140
And like a thing is completely groundbreaking.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:52.260
Like nobody's ever like-

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.100
You always make everything so poetic

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.460
and romantic is disgusting.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.500
But yes, I think you have that engine in your head,

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.780
I guess, of creativity.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.380
Like, yeah, the way you ask questions,

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.500
which is not trivial to do,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.300
like for it's actually very difficult to do,

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.900
like good survey questions.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:13.060
And I mean, we're joking,

01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:14.500
but like, yeah, almost like poetic

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.860
because you have to ask a question

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.940
in a way that doesn't lead to the answer.

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.500
Yes.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:22.180
Like you have to kind of inspire them to think

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.660
and then indirectly get at the truth.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.380
It's an art form, honestly.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:28.100
Yeah, and also in a way

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.620
where they don't misinterpret the question

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:32.660
because it's amazing how any question you think,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:34.020
oh, this is the clearest question possible.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:34.820
No, you're wrong.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:35.700
It has to be even clearer.

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.940
Right, willingly or unwillingly,

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:39.780
because like you also have to defend

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.620
against that question being criticized later

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.380
when you publish about it, all of that.

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.420
You have to think about it all of that.

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:45.780
I think this might be my greatest strength.

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:46.980
So I'm not very good at statistics.

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.420
I'm not like great at presenting data,

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.940
but I think probably my greatest strength

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.660
is in fact survey design and like question phrasing.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.180
Because I have treated so many thousands of polls

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.180
and every single one I get people telling me

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.940
the way that they misinterpreted the poll.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.500
So it's like-

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.300
You've become a master.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:02.180
Gone through fire.

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.620
And then again, I'm testing the phrasings all the time.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:07.300
What happens if you slightly shift phrasings?

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.540
And so I'll do the same question test over time

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.580
to see how it changes

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:13.220
and the way the framing affects the results.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.100
So the good and the bad, the calming.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.660
So you said good, the, what was it?

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.300
I forgot, you said-

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:19.940
The freedom.

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.740
The freedom.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.740
The freedom to also be creative.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:25.940
Yeah, and the bad is just it was exhausting.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.700
The site that I was on, the way that it's structured

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:28.980
is that you're ranking on the site

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.500
and thus the amount of people that see you

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.820
and thus the amount of money you earn

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:34.900
is affected by the amount of money that you earn

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:36.900
on average over the last 60 days.

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:38.820
So if you're streaming and nobody's tipping you,

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:40.500
this means that you're going to be dropping

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:41.220
down in the rankings,

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.500
which is going to make it harder in the future.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.260
Okay, so the rich get richer in that site?

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.860
Yeah, so it's very high pressure.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.780
Like if you're on, you need to be making money

01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:51.380
as fast as you can if you want to continue to make money.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.380
So that was really stressful.

01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.980
It was very mentally taxing.

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.660
I would do it for a couple hours and just log off

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:57.860
and be completely exhausted

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.860
because you're just like on as hard as you can.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:02.580
And this is why I have a little PTSD around streaming.

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:03.780
Like I've considered Twitch streaming

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.700
and I try a little bit and I'm like,

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.700
I haven't fully integrated the fact

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.340
that you don't have to be like maximally entertaining

01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:11.620
every single second yet.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.700
You can actually just chill out and take it slow

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:14.980
and nothing bad happens.

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.220
Yeah, yeah, you can just enjoy silence.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:26.100
Did you feel lonely doing it?

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.460
I mean, even just streamers feel lonely.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.900
I moved into a house of cam girls.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.620
Does that make it better or worse?

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:34.820
They're great.

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.500
I'm still friends with them to this day.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.260
Also there was like a team almost like

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.620
we're in this kind of together.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.380
Yeah, so we would like work together

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.460
and stream together and swap our clothes and stuff.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.140
It was great.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.100
Swap ideas too?

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.140
Swap ideas, yeah.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:53.540
And actually on a small tangent, maybe a big tangent,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.220
what do you think because it's the recent controversy

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:58.820
of Andrew Tate and that he, I think in the past,

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:01.780
ran a camming business and he's being accused

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:03.220
of sex trafficking.

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.380
What do you think, like from your own experience,

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.740
what do you understand about Andrew Tate?

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:09.540
Is he a good person?

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.900
Is he a bad person?

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.220
Is there something shady about his practices or not?

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.820
I wish I could answer, but I don't know.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.260
I haven't looked into it at all.

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:17.620
I've heard people talking about it.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.780
I just haven't bothered to go into it.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.700
It is well known that like when I was doing it

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.140
back in the day, the Eastern European models

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.900
had something different going on though.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.820
It was like a trope about, you know,

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:27.940
there's the Eastern European models

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.900
and then there's everybody else.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.580
That they're what?

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:31.860
It's like darker or something like that?

01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:35.300
Like they do studios and they're lower quality.

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.020
Which means what?

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:40.820
Like studios are, you go into like a warehouse

01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.580
and then they have set up a little like things

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.820
that replicate bedrooms, but they're just like stalls.

01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:47.780
And then you give, you rent out or you pay

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:49.700
the studio percentage of your income.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.300
And you can tell when something looks like a studio,

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.620
it's like a type of background that if you like watching

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.420
enough, it kind of starts to notice the patterns.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:58.580
So like the standards are lower there

01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:00.900
and the ethical boundaries are a little looser.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.980
How people are treated.

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.100
I never heard anything about the ethical side.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.420
I just knew that it was like lower quality.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:10.660
Like the girls seemed like they were less into it

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.900
and like cared less.

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.460
How does this all interplay with like sex trafficking?

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.700
So consensual versus non-consensual?

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.900
I would be shocked if there were never

01:09:18.900 --> 01:09:20.340
any non-consensual camming.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:23.060
I mean, I guess it's like if it were going to happen

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:24.500
I wouldn't be surprised if it were in fact

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.900
Eastern European models based on this is outdated.

01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.340
This is, I'm just thinking of my stereotypes

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.540
back when I cammed a lot.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:30.900
Sure. So some of that is stereotypes

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:32.740
versus like collecting good data, right?

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.220
Yeah, I haven't done data on cam girl.

01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:36.660
It's hard. I mean, it's hard.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.900
It's even hard to get that data, right?

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:40.660
Yeah.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:42.020
But obviously a really important problem.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:43.940
There's a method that I'm trying that I really like.

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.100
I designed a survey type, which is like asking people

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.980
who you know, like who do you know who's done this?

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.300
And you tell me like, oh, do you know anybody who's a doctor?

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.660
Do you know anybody who has had cancer or like smokes or?

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.620
Personally, I mean.

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.140
Yeah, personally. Just do you know anybody?

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.780
And then if you ask about a whole bunch of things

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.100
you can calibrate the responses.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.020
That's really interesting.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.180
If your population, 20% of them know doctors

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.100
and then you know the actual amount of doctors

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:10.100
then you can tell like how this is corresponding.

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.460
Like what is the visibility of doctors?

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.140
So you can reconstruct the graph.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.020
Basically, yeah.

01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.460
And we can do this with sex trafficking.

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:16.340
Of course people are going to be like,

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.540
well, sex trafficking is not visible.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.820
People, you don't know those.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.900
Then we can ask about other non-visible things

01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.460
that other people don't know that we do have data for.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.980
Like homelessness or being in jail

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.380
or like if you have been like sexually assaulted,

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.660
a lot of people don't like talking about

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.940
if they've been sexually assaulted.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:31.380
So you can do a whole bunch of things

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.340
that are like similarly suppressed in knowledge in some way

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.260
that we do actually have rates for.

01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:38.580
And then compare that to the graph when we ask people,

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.100
do you know anybody who's in sex traffic?

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.180
Again, this is not perfect.

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:43.220
I'm not saying this is ideal.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.420
But you can infer things.

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.060
You can infer things about that graph.

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:49.380
But I'm saying we don't have good ways

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.900
of measuring sex trafficking right now.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.740
Anyway, I did a big deep dive into the research

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.980
that we have on sex trafficking in the Western world.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.140
And the actual, like I read the studies

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:58.980
and like reports about the studies

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:00.180
and it's really pitiful.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:01.780
We have terrible data.

01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.180
It's like, there's just like vague estimations

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.660
made from one guy in a basement in the 80s.

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:08.660
That's like the basis for like one big study

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.340
that like a lot of people report on.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.180
And so I'm like, okay.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.220
So the method I'm proposing obviously is not perfect.

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.780
But like the bar is so low at this point.

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:21.300
Well, I wonder also if there's ways to design a survey

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.180
that gets at the victims of sex trafficking also,

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:30.100
which is they presumably have public access to the internet.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:34.900
And I wonder how many of them are distinctly aware

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:36.740
that they're victims.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.500
Like it's asking the question,

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.380
when you're inside of a toxic relationship,

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.860
are you inside of a toxic relationship?

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.660
I mean, if the toxic relationship is truly toxic,

01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:50.820
sometimes your mind is fucked with, right?

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:51.860
You don't even know what's true.

01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:54.580
So it's interesting if you can design surveys.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.020
For people who are actively sex trafficked?

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.540
Yeah, who could break through that.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.220
So basically get data on how many people

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:02.980
are getting sex trafficked directly.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.820
Oh yeah, like if you don't frame it,

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.500
like if you don't say the word sex trafficking,

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.340
you're like, are you just in a situation where you'd...

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:11.300
And maybe through the survey, I mean, that's very meta,

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.660
but through the survey help them.

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:16.020
You know, this is what started my relationship surveys.

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.700
So I've done a series of relationship surveys

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.740
and that was because I knew somebody

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:19.780
in a terrible relationship.

01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:21.940
And I was like, I bet if she took a survey

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.380
where she answered questions about her relationship

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:25.060
and at the end got a score that compared her

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.060
to everybody else, she'd be like, oh wait,

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:29.700
everybody else has much better relationships than I do.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:32.020
So that's why I started making the relationship surveys,

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.140
was exactly for that reason.

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.740
Yeah, that's really, really, really powerful

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:38.580
to know that you're not crazy

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.660
for thinking this is a bad relationship.

01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:43.140
I think like the actual question is like,

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.300
could you do better if you broke up?

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.060
And I think that the thing that keeps most people

01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:47.940
in their relationships is like,

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.060
this is the best that I can do.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.500
This is normal.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.820
And if it were normal, I would say that they are right.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:55.060
Like if you live in a culture where everybody is abusing

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.460
their people in their relationships,

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.460
then yeah, I mean, what are you going to do?

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:01.220
Break up and then just be alone for the rest of your life?

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.820
Most people don't want to do that.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.420
But now comparing yourself to the average is good,

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:07.300
to know, to know.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.060
Know your options are.

01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.420
At least understand it because being normal is not always,

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.740
like this conversation is not always great.

01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.780
Meaning this conversation is anything but normal.

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:26.740
Okay, and that was on a tangent about a niche passion,

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.660
which is really fascinating that you're playing

01:13:28.660 --> 01:13:30.740
with those kinds of ideas of survey design.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.580
But back to camming, so what were the cons?

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:35.940
What were the negatives of camming?

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:38.100
Oh, like the exhaustion of just like life,

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.460
like the high pressure thing.

01:13:39.460 --> 01:13:40.660
That was probably the worst thing.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.180
So what about the interaction with different people,

01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.940
like the dynamics of the interaction with the fans, I guess?

01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.540
I had a pretty great time.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.780
I mean, obviously it wasn't perfect because it's the internet,

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:52.900
but I don't know.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:56.500
This is the thing that confuses me a lot because a lot of women

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.900
that I know complain about being harassed by men quite a lot.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.340
They're like, you know, men are always, you know,

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.460
grow up and never ask, you know,

01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:03.140
you have to be paranoid in the club.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.060
People are like, they're always huffing on you

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:06.500
and you're just like, Jesus Christ, get away, man.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.980
And I do not have this experience or like maybe I do,

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.940
but I'm interpreting it differently.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:10.580
I don't know.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.180
The thing is, I don't know what causes me

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.340
to have such a different experience from these women

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.540
that are like really feel really hostile towards men.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:20.740
My guess is that there's some sort of like very subtle

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.260
signaling that we're accidentally doing.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:23.220
Be like, no fault of our own.

01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.100
I'm not saying this is a virtue.

01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.420
I'm saying like maybe it's just genetic or the fact

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.300
that I've been called.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.100
That women are doing?

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.460
That the women are doing, yeah.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.300
Like that, and it might be just something

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.860
I'm completely accidentally through no intention,

01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.540
like happening to signal the thing

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.140
that is causing men to not view me

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.660
as like a desirable target or like a target at all.

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:41.860
What about the flip side?

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.500
Maybe you're not sensitive to the creepy stare.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.020
Yeah, that also might be true.

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:50.980
The dude who's like as I'm dressing you with his eyes

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.540
that like in a creepy way that you're just not,

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.820
you don't like worry about it or you're not touched.

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.940
Like the fear of that, the anxiety of that,

01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:05.060
the unpleasantness of that just doesn't hit you.

01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:07.860
I think that's also at least part of it.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.580
Maybe all of it.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:11.220
Yeah, I think there's some evidence for it.

01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:12.980
I think often like guys will do a thing to me

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:15.140
and I'm just like, that's a thing, cool.

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:17.300
I don't have any negative response whatsoever.

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.580
That's call back to the tire.

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:21.140
It's a thing.

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.060
This is nice, that happened.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.340
It was good to know that can happen.

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:26.260
I once had like a homeless guy like ask me

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.620
to come back to my place, baby.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.220
And I was like, this is fun.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.780
I'm like, do you want me to, I love asking men like,

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.300
are you trying to get me to have sex with you?

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.900
Just like saying it out front.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.820
And they'll be like, well, usually they stop for a minute.

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.620
They're like, well, yeah, I mean, I would like to have sex.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.820
And they'll be like, thanks for asking,

01:15:42.820 --> 01:15:44.500
but I'm not interested in having sex with you.

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.500
Have a good day.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.300
And that's great.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:49.780
I don't know.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.620
I have no issues with that interaction,

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:53.060
but like maybe this is the kind of thing

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.740
that other women would find to be really offensive.

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.820
So you have that conversation and it doesn't turn

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.580
into like a threatening feel.

01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:58.820
No.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.180
Like with a homeless guy.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.180
No, I've never had that happen though.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.300
But I think there's such something.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.340
I think I'm doing something.

01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:05.940
Again, this is kind of accidental.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.020
I just am like this always.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.940
And I think I just happen to be like this at people

01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.380
and they don't expect it.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.900
They don't expect me to be like really nice

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.140
while explicitly asking them what their intentions are.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.140
Like directly putting my finger on the thing that like,

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.740
oh, you're trying to have sex with me.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.340
And then also not judging them for it.

01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:23.060
I think this like throws people off a little bit

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:24.180
so they don't get aggressive.

01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:25.860
They're like, oh, you're autistic or something.

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:28.660
Even the cloak of anonymity on the internet,

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:29.860
you weren't getting.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.940
Yeah, I just think I'm just not reactive

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.780
and or maybe I'm giving off, I don't know.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:34.580
I don't know what's going on.

01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:36.580
Maybe it's both, maybe it's a feedback loop.

01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:38.180
So I just, I had a pretty good experience.

01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:39.380
I know not everybody did.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.700
Definitely people reported having antagonistic experiences.

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.260
But when I was scamming, I generally really liked.

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.220
People are really nice to me, had a great time, made friends.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.860
So you also did OnlyFans as you mentioned.

01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:54.340
And I read on a website,

01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:56.260
so this is very investigative reporting

01:16:56.980 --> 01:17:03.220
that on some months you've made over $100,000 on OnlyFans.

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.500
How did that feel?

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.180
Great, really great.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.580
I mean, like, well, actually,

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.540
because so much of your upbringing, you didn't have money.

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.460
You had to struggle with the fact of your job and so on.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.180
Maybe a good person to ask, can money buy happiness?

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.180
Well, I mean, I think you get like a resting set point

01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:27.060
of happiness regardless of how much money you have.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.940
But money can buy being less stressed, I would say.

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:37.140
Is there a lot of variation in the basic rest happiness

01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:39.140
for humans in general?

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.740
Like, is that a good thing to think about?

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.820
I mean, they've done some studies, but again, I'm not sure.

01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:43.780
I haven't actually read the studies,

01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.660
so maybe they didn't replicate,

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.140
where they measured people before and after

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.260
winning a bunch of money to see if their happiness is higher.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.820
I think by some measures it was, and by some it wasn't.

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.540
No, I mean, like, basically almost genetically.

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:58.580
So nature and nurture, but is there,

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:00.020
let's say after you're 18,

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.620
is there like some stable level of happiness

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:07.140
that all the environmental genetic factors combine to create

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:08.980
so that everything that life throws at you

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:11.780
has to face that happiness?

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.260
You mentioned earlier that I seem to be happy with a lot of stuff.

01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:16.580
So maybe I have a certain level.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:18.100
Do other people have a lower level?

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:19.380
Some people have higher level?

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.180
Yeah, definitely.

01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:25.380
Like, is that a useful model of human beings?

01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.140
Or is it all ups and downs?

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.140
Like, is it all, like, there's no stable?

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:32.020
It's a combo, right?

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:32.980
I don't know.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.140
Some people just are happier than others in general,

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.820
and other people aren't.

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.180
But then you also have ups and downs.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:40.420
I'm sure you've experienced sadness sometimes

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.540
and happiness the other times.

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.180
If I actually were to integrate,

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:47.700
so to have an integral into the area under the curve,

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.180
I don't know if I'm different than other people.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.300
Maybe I'm just like really focused on the happy moments

01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:56.020
and maybe feel the down moments most intensely.

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:59.620
And maybe that, like, on average, it's all the same.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:00.980
Is that possible?

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.820
I mean, maybe?

01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:05.380
I just, I don't know.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:06.660
Like, I remember when I was a kid,

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.100
my mom would call me Pollyanna all the time.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.020
It's always, like, finding the good in everything.

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:10.340
Oh, yeah?

01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:11.220
I'd be like, something bad would happen.

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:11.940
So you were a happy kid?

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.060
I was a really happy kid, yeah.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.460
Even in the harsh conditions?

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.260
Yeah, I mean, like I said,

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.500
I think the harshness comes from the bad meaning.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.580
Like, and I had good meaning applied to it.

01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.300
So you were stoic.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.060
Yeah.

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.620
With another book I'm reading next week,

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.020
tune in, Marcus Aurelius Meditations.

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.020
All right, all right, camming, 100K.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.060
So it felt good.

01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:39.940
So it's crazy, though, right?

01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.380
You can just, like, take clothes off in a creative way

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.460
with some gnomes and make 100,000.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.380
Yeah, I mean, there was a lot more to it than that,

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:48.260
but yeah.

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:49.060
What was it?

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:49.540
What's the different process?

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.340
I mean, it's marketing.

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.540
Like, so with only, with my free cams,

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:56.180
I was unusual in that I decided to do outside

01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.300
of the website marketing.

01:19:57.300 --> 01:19:59.060
I would, like, post on Reddit, right?

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.100
This was very unusual at the time.

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.940
But, like, OnlyFans is structured such that

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:04.980
they have almost no internal discovery whatsoever.

01:20:04.980 --> 01:20:06.260
So if you want people to come to your page,

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.940
you have to go out onto external websites

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.780
and advertise for yourself directly.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.300
Very different model.

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.140
And so this is something I had already been doing

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.100
and already had practiced in.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:15.460
And so I think I was, like, already quite advanced.

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:16.740
Like, I already had an account on Reddit

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:18.900
that was, like, seven years old at the time.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.940
Tons of, like, karma that means I could post on subreddits.

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.460
I'd already been on Twitter for years,

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.740
you know, like, posting actively.

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:26.420
So I already had, like, presences

01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:27.380
on all these other platforms

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.140
that really helped with the conversion.

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.500
Reddit and Twitter?

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.740
Reddit, Twitter, FetLife, Instagram, TikTok.

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.340
And you were still advertising creatively?

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:36.420
So, like, there's, like, sexuality,

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.700
but there's also, like, creative sexuality.

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.980
And ideas, too.

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:42.740
Yeah, like, one of the really popular ones

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:45.620
was I, like, molested myself as a mime

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:49.860
using one arm through a jacket.

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:51.940
And so the jacket looked like it was...

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.620
The jacket looked like it was alive,

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.940
and, you know, and that one did really well.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.340
Did you, like, brainstorm with somebody?

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.900
And, like, I recently got to hang out with MrBeast

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:09.060
and sit on a session of brainstorming different ideas.

01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:14.020
I just envision you with, like, a team brainstorming.

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.420
All right, how about we try the mime and the molesting thing?

01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.820
I don't know, it's too edgy.

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.820
I wish, I think the two would've been a lot more fun.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.700
But no, it's just me.

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:25.060
Like, I had an apartment that looked like,

01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:26.500
kind of like this, you know.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:27.620
You just sit alone, you're like,

01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.900
well, that would be a good idea.

01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:29.700
And I'd seen...

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.220
You just collect ideas over time, right?

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:34.500
Like, I'd seen somebody doing a version of the,

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.860
like, this animated hand act, like, when I was a kid.

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.220
And I just always stuck in my head.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:41.140
And, like, one day I was like, I bet I could do that.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.060
And then when I was trying to think of ideas to do

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:45.140
as a sex worker, I was like, why don't I just try that?

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:47.300
And then it turned out to be, like, really,

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:48.820
like, quite a viral hit.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.940
Is there, is there stuff, like you mentioned, too edgy?

01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.700
Like, Mr. Beast tries to keep it PG.

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.020
Do you try to keep it PG-13?

01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:57.700
Well, with the sex advertising stuff,

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.900
I mean, it's sex advertising, so it's obviously not PG-13.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.020
I don't know these ratings.

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:03.700
What is even beyond that R?

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:04.420
It's not family friendly.

01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:05.780
It is X.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.860
Like, the one that I'm describing to you at some point,

01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:09.300
like, you can see my boob, so.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.380
So as a boob is X.

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:12.740
A boob is, I guess...

01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:13.620
It's not R.

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:15.300
I think you could show a boob in PG-13.

01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:17.140
Yeah, maybe X is like, if you got some sort of

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.500
rhythmic motion going on.

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.940
Maybe that's sound, but the rhythmic motion not.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:27.380
You can have one or the other, but you can't have both.

01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:27.940
You have both.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:30.180
That's when we hit the X, yeah.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:30.900
Okay.

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:31.860
So definitely not family.

01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:33.300
I mean, with the sex advertising stuff,

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:34.580
like, guys like vanilla shit.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.620
Guys want basic, hot girl.

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.540
You can do something like kind of sexy and creative,

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:40.580
like getting abducted by gnomes,

01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:42.020
or like the self molestation, right?

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:45.060
But those are still pretty within the normal boundaries.

01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:47.940
What do you mean, guys like vanilla stuff?

01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:50.180
I mean, most guys like vanilla stuff.

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.140
What's vanilla stuff?

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:51.940
Like, hot girl big heart.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:52.900
We'll talk about fetish.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:54.900
Fetishes.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.900
I think my Overton window on what is vanilla

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:02.900
is expanding quickly after following your work.

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.140
I actually have done a lot of studies on what is vanilla.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.340
I've done a couple different surveys

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.580
where I ask people how taboo is this thing,

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:12.900
and I have a rating from least to most taboo.

01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.260
By the way, I don't like,

01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.500
I don't appreciate the beauty of vanilla ice cream.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.020
You don't?

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:19.060
It is really good, though.

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.380
You eat vanilla ice cream?

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.980
I eat vanilla ice cream, yeah.

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:24.820
I think there's just so many more options.

01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.980
It's like the absence of creativity.

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.620
I mean, if you put in like some chocolate chips or something.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:34.420
Yeah, they already made it more interesting to start.

01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.700
Okay, so what's vanilla?

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:37.700
And why do guys like vanilla?

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:39.780
So hot girl doing hot girl things?

01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.420
What, like undressing and then having sex?

01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:44.260
The thing that I found was most successful

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:47.460
were frames where the man was framed as passive

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:48.580
and the woman is active.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.460
Or like, for example, like, oh, you know,

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:52.900
we got assigned to the same bunk

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.620
at the breeding school or something.

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:58.420
Or like, oh, we're the last people on earth, right?

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.460
Or like, oh, no, you know, I like,

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.780
I desperately need somebody to like cure me

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.620
with this disease and I need semen.

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.540
So it's like in any scenario where the guy

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.860
is just like finds himself such that the woman

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:11.380
like desperately needs him for some reason

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.740
and he doesn't have to do much.

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:16.020
That is like typically one of the much more successful things.

01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:18.260
Like guys like women falling into their lap.

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.540
What about the power dynamic?

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.140
So guys are less into power dynamics than women are.

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.460
And you can do power dynamics as long as it's like handed to them.

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.180
Some guys, obviously, some guys are like very dominant

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.540
and like prefer like having to work.

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.340
But this is the minority.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:34.660
Like if you're trying to do, make a hundred K in a month

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.060
and you're trying to appeal to the widest group of people,

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.900
the most effective advertising,

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.100
you're not going to be making the most money

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:41.940
by being like particularly submissive.

01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:47.380
So on the camming side, that's your, unlike like escorting

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:50.660
or just personal relationships, you're trying to,

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:53.940
you have an audience, you have like a theater full of people.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:55.620
Like with live camming?

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.420
Yeah, with live camming.

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:58.260
Yeah, it's like a live theater.

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.060
Does that freak you out?

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.500
There's just like a bunch of people watching.

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.180
How do you feel right now?

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.380
I don't know they're watching because it's not live.

01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:05.940
Yeah, that's true.

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:06.660
It's not live.

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.900
So like it might as well be like they could be watching.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.540
I feel like there's just the two of us.

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:12.100
I don't know.

01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:14.980
And there's like, I feel sometimes I imagine there's a third person.

01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:15.700
Like God?

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:17.220
Usually, no, no, not God.

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:21.780
Just I usually imagine either a guy or girl or a couple

01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.300
just sitting there for some reason,

01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:25.220
like usually on the beach and usually high

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.540
or on some kind of like mushrooms,

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.300
just like listening passively,

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.660
just kind of looking at the sunset.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:31.540
That's what I imagine.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.500
That's really good.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.780
Yeah, I think that's useful.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.660
Like when I write my blog posts, sometimes I do terribly,

01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:39.140
but it's the most effective when I imagine one person

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.820
that I'm writing to to try to explain.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:43.060
And like having a high couple watching the sunset

01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.940
is maybe really lovely as a calibration.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.620
I have to say it is pretty romantic

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.500
because I've gotten a chance to meet couples

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:51.860
that listen to podcasts together.

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:56.020
I don't know why that seems like intensely romantic to me

01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:00.740
because you're not watching TV together.

01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:02.580
You're listening to a thing.

01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:03.860
I guess sometimes they watch it,

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:08.100
but like you're listening to ideas together.

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.340
I don't know.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.060
It's like you're going through

01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.060
the same kind of thought process at the same time.

01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.420
That's a really beautiful way to put it.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:16.580
So it's like you're melding,

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:18.900
your thinking is following the same line.

01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.820
Some of our podcasts do that more than movies.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:22.260
I think movies give you a lot more freedom

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.460
to think about stuff.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.220
I feel like your thoughts are aligned.

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:27.940
And like, especially if the podcast is good,

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:31.940
like if it's listening to like a Dan Carlin podcast

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.340
about history, that you're like on a journey together.

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:37.460
There's an intimacy to that anyway.

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:40.660
But I've learned that couples do that.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:43.860
Hashtag relationship ghost.

01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.180
Go ahead.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.020
That's what you want with your future wife?

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:48.500
You should make an application.

01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:49.940
Application?

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.140
An application for dating you.

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.540
I mean, maybe this is more of like my strategy and less yours,

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.460
but you have like a wide enough audience that might work.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:27:04.180
I, it's not, okay, let's just go there.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.940
So you, cause you've put together an application

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.580
of like people to have casual sex with you.

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:11.220
I think you've had that also dating and also dating

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:12.020
and relationship.

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:12.580
I'd love to.

01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:14.340
So what is in that application?

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:20.260
Cause like, you know, I'm sure there's quite a lot of people

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.380
that would like to date you or to sleep with you,

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.900
but finding the person, I mean, it depends on your goals.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:29.300
I guess relationship would be an open relationship for you.

01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.860
Yes.

01:27:29.860 --> 01:27:30.340
Right.

01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:34.260
Like for me, I guess it's more intensely selective

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.340
because it's like a monogamous relationship

01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:37.860
and a committed one.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:44.740
Like, like, like I'm swinging for the, like for like long-term.

01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:48.900
I'm not, I'm not like weirdly obsessed with long-term,

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:51.220
but it's like, you just, I would love to have one girl

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.580
for the rest of my life.

01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:56.340
But the finding that I feel like applications

01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.380
will not get to that.

01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:59.300
I feel like there's some aspect of the magic

01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:01.940
of the serendipity of it, of meeting people

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.140
in strange places and so on.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:06.180
I just, I personally have noticed that like fame

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.260
has not made that process easier.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.340
But I mean, like if you could, you know,

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.700
if there's two rooms and one of them,

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.860
it's like a random population of hot women

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.700
and the other one is a random population of hot women,

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.940
but all of them definitely are monogamous

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.780
and are looking for a long-term committed relationship.

01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.020
Yeah.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:21.620
Like which room would you rather go into?

01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:24.900
Like if you're looking for a mate.

01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:27.460
Yeah, well, but see, I guess my preferences are more,

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.300
that's a really strong point,

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:33.060
but my preferences represent the majority probably, right?

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:35.540
Because don't most women want monogamous relationships?

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:36.180
Yeah.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.380
So like it's, I'm okay with either option.

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.940
Because like statistically speaking.

01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:44.260
Right, but like we can apply it to like a bunch of other things.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:45.860
Yeah, and I'm just, this is just a problem

01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.780
if you have like high, if you have a high volume

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.300
to filter through and you like, you don't know.

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.740
Like it's a good like initial filter.

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:54.260
Like you can take it from like a thousand people to 20 people

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:55.220
and then go on dates with them.

01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.620
But the filter is so anti-romantic, like what?

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.820
This is true, this is not the romantic narrative

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:02.660
that you're very prone to.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.460
If I feel like, how did you two meet?

01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.780
Well, she passed the three filters I set up.

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:16.580
And I mean, but it's also, but also can you put into a survey

01:29:16.580 --> 01:29:18.580
the things that you're interested in?

01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:19.860
Yeah.

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.660
I mean, I definitely think about this a lot with hiring,

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.820
like teams, engineers, and so on.

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:33.140
But with engineers, you're okay losing truly special engineers

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:35.380
because you have to filter

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.540
because there's like thousands of applications.

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:41.620
Like it feels like, it feels like I worry

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:43.620
that you would miss the thing that actually,

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:46.020
because so much of it is chemistry,

01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:47.700
so much of it is like the magic, you know.

01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:49.300
But the thing is you're missing it anyway.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:50.580
Yeah, you're missing it.

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.780
It's, oh, you can just run it.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.100
And then in addition, try some of those people.

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:55.860
And then go on the dates

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.660
that you were going to go on with anyway, regardless.

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.060
It's just the thing that helps like pull someone out of the crowd.

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.980
Like this, I dated a guy from my survey.

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.860
I'd ran the survey.

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.420
I assigned point values to each of the questions.

01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:08.180
I wanted to date with like the top couple of people.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:09.300
And then one of them, I was like,

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:11.940
and I'm still dating him to this day.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.580
And it was awesome.

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.860
And I would never, I never would have gone on a date with him

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.740
without the survey.

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:19.300
Can you, if from memory or we can look it up,

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.300
do you remember what kind of questions were on the survey?

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.580
I asked a couple of different categories.

01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:23.940
I asked about like basic life stuff.

01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:25.300
So like what kind of relationships,

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:26.740
like monogamy versus polyamory,

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:28.340
like do you want kids, you know,

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:29.620
like where you want to live,

01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:32.100
like basic things that you need to be compatible.

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:33.940
And then I asked like sexual compatibility,

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:35.620
like various preferences.

01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:37.460
And then I had a section about like personality.

01:30:37.460 --> 01:30:39.220
Like what are, I try to ask questions

01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:41.060
that would do the most effective filtering.

01:30:41.060 --> 01:30:44.980
So like, what are ways that like I can't give people

01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:47.220
what they need that like maybe they really want.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:49.460
Like, I don't really, I'm not very outdoorsy.

01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:50.260
It was just very common.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.140
A lot of people like being outdoorsy.

01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:51.940
So I asked the question like,

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.700
how much do you value someone else

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:55.300
that you're dating being outdoorsy?

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.620
And if they marked yes, I was like, okay, we probably,

01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.060
I should probably downgrade the results.

01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:02.260
Man, but doesn't polyamory make that really difficult?

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:05.140
Because can't they find somebody for the outdoorsy stuff?

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:05.700
Yeah, they could.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:07.140
I mean, this doesn't like,

01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.900
but if you're going to have somebody,

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:10.980
it's like nicer to have them be more compatible than less.

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:13.540
But you're a little bit like,

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:15.460
in terms of sexual compatibility,

01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:18.900
you're able to like yourself aware enough

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.660
to know what preferences you have.

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:21.460
Like you can.

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:22.020
I think so.

01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.660
I think that one helped a lot with the escorting.

01:31:24.660 --> 01:31:26.740
Like the escorting helped a lot with knowing my preferences.

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:29.140
But there's like out of the giant pool

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:30.420
of different preferences,

01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:33.140
you have like a subset that's clearly defined for you.

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:34.580
Okay.

01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:37.140
Like dominant submissive.

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:38.260
Yeah, power dynamic stuff.

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.060
Power dynamic stuff.

01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:41.620
Okay.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:43.780
Not just sexual, but in relationship too.

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.980
Like that was that in the survey?

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.980
I don't like power dynamics in relationships.

01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:47.300
I didn't ask about-

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:50.260
Defining them in like making it clear in a survey,

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:53.220
like asking a question about power dynamics in a relationship.

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.420
I don't think I asked about power dynamics in relationships.

01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.140
Because I just assume most people don't.

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.460
And there's a lot of things that kind of like-

01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:02.340
Most people don't.

01:32:02.340 --> 01:32:04.020
You're putting together a survey,

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.780
a systematic survey to understand compatibility.

01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:11.700
Wouldn't power dynamics inside of relationships

01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:16.100
that naturally emerge often be part of the question?

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:19.780
Or is that hard to question because it naturally emerges?

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:23.540
Well, the thing is like a lot of questions sort of overlap in demographic.

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:24.660
And if you're making a survey,

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:26.500
you want to have the minimum possible questions

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.380
that give the maximum possible like filtering information.

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:32.260
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.460
But that purpose of that survey wasn't to do a good research study.

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.940
It was to select one subject that you could take.

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.380
So this part of it is good.

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:41.140
You want to most efficiently filter out.

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.220
Because one, you get more people taking the survey

01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.020
the fewer questions you have, which is good for finding a mate.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.980
If you have 5,000 men take the survey, it's better than 1,000 men take it.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:53.380
Don't you want men that would be patient enough and dedicated enough to-

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:55.220
Yeah, but what if you want like a high-powered man

01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.300
who's like on his lunch break, right?

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:58.340
So it's like-

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:00.340
Like a billionaire is too busy just flipping through.

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:03.780
And the guy that I dated, he took the survey,

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:05.780
he was waiting for the pizza to come out of the oven.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:07.460
And so it was important that it was short.

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.420
Is that metaphor or literally pizza coming out of the oven?

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.020
He was literally waiting for pizza.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:15.060
And he saw the things like I guess I'll just fill out the survey really fast

01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:16.820
and changed our lives.

01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:17.620
So romantic.

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.260
It's for me, this is my kind of romance.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:21.620
I'm really into it.

01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:23.780
But you could be efficient with surveys

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.540
by like making sure your questions don't overlap.

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.620
So for example, if somebody is very polyamorous,

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:31.380
they're very unlikely to be interested in like a traditional like man works

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.780
and the job and the woman stays home

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.300
and raises the kids kind of relationship.

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.220
Because poly people just generally don't do that.

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.900
And so if I'm asking about polyamory,

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:41.220
it sort of kind of already covers the thing.

01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:42.660
And so if I have a whole bunch of questions,

01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:45.940
like I can kind of like triangulate a bunch of implicit kinds of questions

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.220
that I haven't directly asked about.

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.940
So this is why I didn't ask directly about power dynamics

01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:52.420
because like from the rest of the questions that are in my survey,

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.900
like I can pretty accurately predict

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.380
whether or not you're going to be interested in power dynamics.

01:33:57.620 --> 01:34:02.420
I'm afraid I'm trying to think as you're talking, I get it.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:05.300
That's really interesting that you did that.

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:08.420
Also, maybe not for the effectiveness of finding a partner,

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:13.780
but for just exploring the actual the process of human sexuality,

01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:18.100
of like the search, this complicated optimization process

01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:21.140
we're all engaging in on the landscape of happiness

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.820
that seems to be this not even a differentiable function.

01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.820
It's a giant nonlinear mess.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.780
Okay, but like for me,

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:33.860
I don't think I would be able to design that survey.

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.620
I would like bias it too strongly.

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:39.220
Like I'll probably prefer women

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:42.260
that have read Dostoevsky or something like that.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.020
Like that would be a filter for me, right?

01:34:44.020 --> 01:34:44.500
Yeah.

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:47.940
But like that's a horrible filter because there's a lot of like,

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.620
there's a lot of amazing people that have never,

01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.900
they don't give a shit about reading

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.900
or they don't give a shit about reading Russian literature

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:54.180
or they don't give a shit about,

01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.420
but they're amazing and passionate and creative

01:34:56.980 --> 01:34:59.140
in some other dimension that you might completely miss.

01:34:59.140 --> 01:35:01.860
But you were like, because I wonder if there's any,

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:04.580
basically you're saying compatibility like hard lines

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.620
that you know statistically is just going to be an issue.

01:35:08.340 --> 01:35:10.100
Yeah, I mean, you weight this a lot more.

01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:10.420
Yeah.

01:35:10.420 --> 01:35:11.620
But there's also like preferences.

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.540
Like if you have a woman who's totally equal

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.740
and she's read the thing that you like,

01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:16.820
it's another woman who's also identical,

01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:18.740
but like she hasn't read the thing that you like.

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:20.500
Like you probably like very slightly prefer the one that happens.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:21.540
But you don't know if they're identical.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:22.020
Yes, yes.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.180
But like you can't through survey get the identical.

01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.300
Like you don't know.

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.540
Sure, but you can kind of like do a whole bunch of weight.

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.460
So like the person that like I ended up going on a date with,

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:33.060
he did not answer like correctly to a lot of the survey questions,

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.180
but he didn't have to.

01:35:34.180 --> 01:35:35.700
Like he was just overall,

01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:38.740
overall the weights were like he just tended to be more in the direction.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:41.380
Was there a text-based fill-in like survey?

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.140
But like, oh sorry, paragraph like?

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.180
No, you want to avoid that

01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:46.260
if you're dealing with like large amounts of data.

01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:47.300
No, why not?

01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:50.820
Because you have to fill, oh, oh, interesting, interesting.

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:53.060
Like I'm different because like first of all,

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.100
I can do keyword searches.

01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:58.020
Second of all, you can do machine learning models that like,

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.740
like first of all, you can do,

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.140
you can do like crude metrics like the length.

01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:05.780
That's a good point.

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.620
Of how long they've written, right?

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.740
And it could flag certain things.

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.340
Yeah, it's actually pretty easy to,

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:14.340
like I've looked at like for hiring,

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:17.380
I've looked at like thousands of applications really quickly.

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:19.860
Like you can really, the human brain is really interesting,

01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:26.420
especially like if you visually highlight certain information for yourself,

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:31.940
like keywords or again with machine learning models like sentiment,

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.260
you can highlight different parts that will catch your eye better than not.

01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.060
And I can go through just a huge number of applications.

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.460
Are you telling me I can use, if I learn machine learning,

01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:44.740
I can process dating survey applications better?

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.300
Yes.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:46.740
No, like textual.

01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:48.580
Yeah, like I can like have them write things in.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:50.340
Like this is like a new way of.

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:51.060
That would be, yeah.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.420
It's a really good incentive.

01:36:52.420 --> 01:36:58.100
I think that would, so the really nice aspect of text input,

01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:01.220
like long form text input, multiple long form text input

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.540
based on an interestingly phrased question,

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:07.540
is you get to learn how to make a better survey.

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:08.980
I think you would appreciate that.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.420
Like you start to see how they're actually interacting with these questions.

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.020
Like I asked certain questions like,

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.260
just to see how people think.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.820
Is it better to work smart or better to work hard?

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:27.060
Or is it ever okay to betray a close friend?

01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:31.700
Like I'll ask like questions like this that don't really have a right answer,

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.900
but I just want to see how they think.

01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.700
Or is truth more important than loyalty?

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:35.940
Yeah.

01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:38.820
And I get their long form answer.

01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:40.820
You get like, and you get to see the reasoning process.

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:41.620
Yeah, yeah.

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:43.700
Like what they, it reveals so much,

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:45.940
not just about the person,

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:48.180
but about the kind of questions I should be asking

01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:50.260
that have nothing to do with truth or loyalty,

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.460
but like how to get a good engineer with like very specific questions.

01:37:53.460 --> 01:37:56.100
But I think it's really useful to get text input.

01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.660
I have done text input usually with beta surveys.

01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:00.660
So I usually do beta surveys before I do the real survey.

01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.340
I do like a shorter version or it depends on what I'm doing,

01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.580
but like a different version of the survey

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.260
that I have people take before I release.

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.260
I use their information from the initial survey

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.820
to inform the questions that I ask in the real survey.

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.580
And I haven't actually in recently,

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:18.420
but I used to do a lot of like the text based questions to see for similar,

01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:20.420
although I don't think I relied on it quite as heavily.

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:22.820
And if I introduced machine learning, things would be a lot more efficient.

01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.740
I love that you're also doing like you're writing scripts and stuff.

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:31.060
Like you're doing, you're doing some like, like statistical analysis using Python.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.380
Yeah. I had to learn Python for this.

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:38.020
Which is the best way to learn Python.

01:38:38.020 --> 01:38:41.620
And the best reason to learn machine learning is to solve actual like

01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:42.900
problems.

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:44.180
Yeah. I can't be motivated.

01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:47.060
I'm just not motivated to learn something unless there's an actual curiosity I have,

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:48.420
and I have to learn it and to solve it.

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.900
I was trying to avoid learning coding for so long,

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:53.540
but eventually it was with my data set became too large.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:55.060
I couldn't work with it with anything else.

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.380
So oh, Python it is.

01:38:57.380 --> 01:39:00.180
You know what's also an interesting data set that you're probably interested in

01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:02.020
a little bit is like Twitter itself, right?

01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:05.540
I don't know if you've, I've played with the Twitter API a lot.

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:11.460
Can you just get the download that I'm just, I'm stuttering now.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.420
The Twitter, the Twitter.

01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:18.020
No, there's a lot of Twitter, Twitter.

01:39:18.020 --> 01:39:20.580
So Twitter is a social network with a bunch of people.

01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:21.780
They're interacting a lot.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.540
Like there's like, I don't know, the number is insane.

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:30.820
The number of interactions, but there's different ways to interact,

01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.940
to get data from Twitter.

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:32.660
There's streams.

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:35.380
You can look at, it depends what you're interested in.

01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.380
You can do results for searches.

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.580
You can look at individual tweets and get entire,

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:42.260
which to me is super interesting.

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:45.060
The entire tree of different conversations that are the replies,

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.180
which might be very interesting for you because like,

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:54.340
it's not, it's much harder to ask rigorous questions,

01:39:54.340 --> 01:39:55.780
which you do with your polls,

01:39:56.340 --> 01:39:59.300
but you could see like how divisive certain things are.

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.500
You're probably like calibrators to figure out like exactly

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.020
what questions you should be asking.

01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:04.820
Yeah.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:07.380
And also highlight interesting anecdotal things.

01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:11.140
Two people freak out at each other and just argue like a thread

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.300
that goes on for like a thousand messages

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:15.220
that you might never be even aware is happening

01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.860
because Twitter doesn't like surface that.

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:20.900
Like Twitter doesn't make it easy for you to like visualize

01:40:20.900 --> 01:40:24.340
what the hell's going on even with your own social network.

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:27.460
Like if you post something that's controversial,

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:29.220
that gets a large amount of attention,

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:32.500
you can't clearly visualize everything that's going on.

01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:37.300
Like it's, it's very, it's a blurry amorphous,

01:40:37.300 --> 01:40:39.300
like you're just kind of looking through the fog

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:42.020
at different replies and the kind of, it's yeah.

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:45.780
So the API, they have like graphs of networks?

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:47.220
They have the data for the graphs.

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:47.460
Yeah.

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.220
So you can reconstruct yourself.

01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:49.780
Yeah.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.460
And then you have different levels of access

01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:53.620
in terms of how many queries you can do.

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:55.700
That is really cool.

01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.940
And now, because there's like Elon,

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:03.060
there's a lot of sort of revolutionary stuff

01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:03.940
happening at Twitter.

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:08.180
I think you could literally sort of push for innovation there.

01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.820
Like there's aggressive innovation happening.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:13.700
So in terms of requesting stuff for the API,

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:14.820
you could do all that kind of stuff.

01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:18.580
I think Twitter is just a fascinating platform for the,

01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:21.140
as cliche as it sounds, for studying.

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:25.700
For me, it's interesting what makes for a healthy conversation.

01:41:25.700 --> 01:41:26.740
That term has been used,

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.580
but it's interesting how conversation,

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:30.740
to me it's fascinating how conversations break down

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:37.540
and not like how, like the virality of drama

01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:42.020
or conflict or disagreement,

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:45.780
how that evolves when a large number of people are involved,

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:50.180
when a large number of misinterpretation

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.980
of statements is involved in text-based

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:54.900
with some anonymity thrown in.

01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:57.300
I feel like there's a lot of study that can be done there.

01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:00.500
I mean, Twitter's probably not great at it as it stands.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:00.820
No.

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.500
Because it's necessarily short.

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.500
You can quote, treat things out of context, et cetera.

01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:06.340
But we should understand that, right?

01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:06.900
Yeah.

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:10.180
At a large scale, you should be able to study that kind of thing.

01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.580
Oh yeah, what was your casual sex survey?

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.180
I actually haven't looked at it in a while.

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.340
I think I just asked people about a whole bunch of fetishes

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.780
because you don't want to be obvious about yours

01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.220
because then people are going to hijack it

01:42:21.220 --> 01:42:23.700
to try to tell you that they like what you like.

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:24.260
Oh, sure.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.060
So you want to be obscure.

01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:26.900
So how do you design a survey where you're testing for a thing

01:42:26.900 --> 01:42:28.820
but you're still obscure about the thing you're trying to ask about?

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.980
You still see it as a survey.

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:32.180
Yeah.

01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:33.060
Like an application.

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.780
Because I think your tweet is saying,

01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:38.100
I'm thinking of just showing up to San Francisco and saying,

01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:41.220
is anybody open for casual sex?

01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:41.940
Yeah.

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:42.660
Something like this.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:44.260
Am I misremembered?

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.140
Maybe escorting?

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:45.780
I'm not sure.

01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:47.300
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:48.420
Which is similar.

01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:51.300
I kind of use escorting as the way to have casual sex now.

01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:54.420
Okay.

01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:55.940
So let's talk about escorting.

01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:58.420
So you wrote about escorting in your blog post.

01:42:58.420 --> 01:42:59.700
Escorting was good for me.

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:03.140
How did you get into escorting?

01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:07.620
I quit camming because I was burned out

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:09.700
and I was trying to work at a friend's startup

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.340
and it was hard for me.

01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:15.220
It's difficult for me to work on projects that are not my projects.

01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:18.340
And so I was like, hey, fuck it.

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:19.380
I want to go back to sex work.

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:20.020
I want to make more money,

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:21.540
but I don't want to cam anymore because I'm burned out.

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:22.580
So I'm like, well, let's try.

01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:23.780
I had a friend who was an escort.

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.660
I'm like, let's try that.

01:43:24.660 --> 01:43:26.100
And so we had a call.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.380
She outlined the basics for me

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:30.180
and then I put up some ads and it started working.

01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:32.180
What's the basics of escorting?

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:33.060
How does that work?

01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:34.500
If you want to get started escorting,

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.420
so just in case you have a career change,

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:38.660
we're going to want you to get some nice photos

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:39.700
so you probably have those.

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:42.900
First of all, you assumed I haven't done it before.

01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:43.460
How rude.

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:43.860
Have you?

01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:44.900
Yeah.

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.700
Well, you know, recreation,

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.380
I would like to do professionally, I suppose.

01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.740
So if I wanted to do it, if I wanted to do it,

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:55.700
if I really want to step up my game, how would I do it?

01:43:56.820 --> 01:43:57.060
Yeah.

01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:58.580
Well, you got the whole tutorial.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.100
Recreational escorting is just okay.

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:04.420
Okay.

01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:10.900
Not meaning like, you know, like selling products on Etsy

01:44:12.020 --> 01:44:14.420
versus doing a startup.

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:19.140
Well, I mean, escorting is kind of all just selling products on Etsy.

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:20.580
Selling a lot of products.

01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:22.340
High volume.

01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.340
You've like dabbled.

01:44:26.740 --> 01:44:29.140
Small handcrafted artisan.

01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:33.460
Dolls escorting versus mass manufacture.

01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:35.300
Okay.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.380
If you want to mass manufacture your escorting.

01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:39.380
I just feel like I haven't been getting,

01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:42.580
you know, I've been undervaluing my services

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.260
and I would like to really step up.

01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:46.820
I think you could really just like grease some marketing gears

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.180
and be true to your goal.

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:48.340
Yeah.

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.260
I mean, some of this is marketing.

01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:52.420
So like how, I guess I want to like know,

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.820
is it similar to camming in that way?

01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:57.860
Like, is it you're basically advertising yourself

01:44:57.860 --> 01:45:02.820
and you're marketing all the creativity

01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.180
that you mentioned before, all of that.

01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:04.900
Yeah.

01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:06.340
I found escorting to be pretty easy

01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:09.220
because escorting is not like highly competitive.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.740
For example, camming is highly competitive

01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:13.380
because like the thing that I outlined before,

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.660
you know, the amount of money that you make

01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.780
determines your ranking.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:17.540
And you can also go and see other girls.

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:18.740
You can see what they're doing.

01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.340
So if a girl figures that incredible strategy

01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:22.020
for making money, it's like two seconds

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.500
before that strategy proliferates into everybody else.

01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.740
So it's very fast paced and like really tough.

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:28.020
With escorting, you don't get to see

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.140
what other girls are doing.

01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.100
You can look at their websites,

01:45:30.100 --> 01:45:31.220
but like you don't know what they're doing

01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:32.260
with clients at all.

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:33.700
You can look at their rates,

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.980
but you don't know what their volume is.

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.220
So you don't actually know what is successful

01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.180
and what isn't very much.

01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:41.780
So I think there's much less like evolution

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:43.860
of marketing through this process.

01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:46.660
And so I came in with like my aggressive marketing skills

01:45:46.660 --> 01:45:47.620
sort of being a cam girl.

01:45:47.620 --> 01:45:48.580
I think that really helped.

01:45:48.580 --> 01:45:50.660
I did very well as an escort.

01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:52.580
I just came in like made a fantastic website.

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.620
I knew how to do the ads right.

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.060
What was the finding people?

01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:00.260
I guess it's also like finding the right kind of customer

01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.260
or the right kind of client.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.340
I got like in a lot of trouble for this recently

01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:06.340
in the sex worker sphere because I said that

01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:07.700
if you raise prices, you're more likely

01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.620
to encounter clients that aren't going to abuse you.

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:11.140
Like it's safer.

01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:15.540
They said that I was being classist,

01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.460
implying that poor people are more violent.

01:46:17.460 --> 01:46:19.220
But to be fair, if you're a guy

01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.580
and you want to be violent towards a woman,

01:46:20.580 --> 01:46:22.020
you're probably not going to be paying her a lot of money.

01:46:22.020 --> 01:46:22.820
You're probably going to be like,

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:25.300
you're the kind of person likely who's going to haggle a lot

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:26.260
because you don't respect her.

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:29.540
But anyway, that aside, it's a little peppy for me.

01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.980
Yeah, I just started charging 800 an hour

01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:34.980
and then pretty rapidly raised it to 1200.

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:37.780
And then a while after that, raised it to 1400.

01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:39.060
Well, the interesting thing you mentioned

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.820
in my sense of research,

01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:46.020
you used to do 1200 to 1400 an hour.

01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:48.820
And then you said that you're thinking of jumping back in

01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:52.500
at a rate of 2400 the first hour.

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:56.340
And I think 900 each successive hour.

01:46:56.900 --> 01:46:57.700
That's interesting.

01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:01.060
That's like, I mean, to me, that's really interesting.

01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:02.740
Like the first, like why?

01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:04.980
It's like a lot of the first hour.

01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:09.860
Oh, it's just because it depends on how you want to incentivize

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:10.900
the amount of hours.

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.340
So if you have to pay a lot for the first hour,

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:13.460
but not pretty much for the successive,

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.380
you're more likely to buy a longer period of time.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:19.060
And usually I find that clients who buy a longer period of time

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.500
are nicer to you.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:22.740
I don't have a great theory for why that is,

01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:24.180
but they're more likely to take you to dinner

01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:24.900
and get to know you first.

01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:26.260
And I just enjoy that a lot more.

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:30.100
I enjoy knowing who I'm going to have sex with.

01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.580
Like a date, you know?

01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:38.660
Yeah, so it incentivized the long form date dynamic versus like not.

01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:39.620
That's really interesting.

01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.460
That's really interesting.

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.980
How does money change the dynamic?

01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:48.980
Just basic human dynamic of interacting for free versus for money.

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:52.100
Like I think about that a lot because like just talking to rich people,

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.620
it's like you usually get paid for your time

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:55.860
and you're doing this for free.

01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.260
Like what's the difference?

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.940
Is there a difference really or no?

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:02.740
A bit, yeah.

01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:04.500
So I've actually, it depends a lot.

01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.540
So when I was doing it full time, it was my only source of income.

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.900
It changed quite a lot because I was really incentivized

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:12.180
to have repeat customers.

01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.300
So I'm like, okay, if I'm my primary interaction with you

01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.140
is to like have you hire me again.

01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:19.140
I'll do whatever that takes to make that happen.

01:48:19.140 --> 01:48:21.460
And so if I have to like laugh at jokes that I don't find funny

01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:24.180
or like be like more adoring of your penis

01:48:24.180 --> 01:48:26.740
than I actually genuinely feel, like that's what I'm going to express.

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:30.420
And obviously it's to some degree like titrated, you know?

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:33.380
It's unpleasant to force yourself to like something that you don't.

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:35.940
So like I would actually like not see clients again

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:37.780
that I didn't want to, but to some degree

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.460
there was a sort of self-suppression going on,

01:48:39.460 --> 01:48:42.900
which I think is the way it works in any sort of customer service job.

01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:44.660
Like you want the customer to leave happy.

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:46.740
So you just make sure that you are happy the whole time

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:49.220
and you're like, ah, really enjoying the other person.

01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:52.420
But so recently when I've like kind of dabbled in it

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:55.540
since baking money through other means

01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:59.620
where I don't need the money, it's more like a fun side thing

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.300
that I'm, like I said, it's fulfilling the role of casual sex for me.

01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.860
So like I don't have to do it. This is not my primary job.

01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:08.660
I just want sort of a good excuse to like have sex with somebody.

01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:10.900
And the money is like a great filter for that.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:12.500
And so in that case-

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:14.500
That's interesting. So the money is just a bit, yeah, okay.

01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:16.020
The money is basically a filter for somebody

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:17.620
who's taking this interaction seriously.

01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:20.740
Yeah. It also, so there's an interesting like psychological thing

01:49:20.740 --> 01:49:22.900
where I have difficulty having casual sex with somebody

01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:26.020
because some part of my brain, which I assume is like quite female,

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.620
is doing some evaluation of status

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:30.180
and whether or not this is going to damage my reputation

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.460
by having sex with them.

01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:33.780
So like if you found out that I went and like had random sex

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:35.860
with like a homeless man, you might be like, wow,

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:37.060
that says something about Ayla.

01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:39.540
Like maybe she's trashy or she just has no standards

01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:40.420
for who she's going to fuck.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.700
And so some part of me is continually anxious.

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.860
I'm like, does this mean I have no standards?

01:49:45.860 --> 01:49:47.460
If I decide to have casual sex with you,

01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:48.500
like what are people going to think?

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:52.100
And so if you introduce money, it takes away that anxiety.

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:54.180
I don't have to worry about it because it's like,

01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:55.780
oh, of course Ayla would have sex with that person.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:56.260
They paid her.

01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.740
Like this is not an indication of the kind of mate

01:49:58.740 --> 01:49:59.700
that she can get.

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.340
This is just an indication of like a business transaction.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:05.380
And this allows me to enjoy casual sex so much more

01:50:05.380 --> 01:50:06.660
when somebody pays me for it.

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:08.820
To the degree that like I almost view it as a kink.

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.220
And so it's like, so I'm using it sort of

01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:12.340
to replace casual sex now.

01:50:12.340 --> 01:50:14.260
Like occasionally I'm like, you know,

01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:16.420
like it's paid me a little bit to erase the anxiety

01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:18.660
and I'll like have a fun time.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.020
I mean, can't you see like dinner like that

01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:21.780
or something like that if the person pays for dinner?

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:26.260
Or like, so like it's all just if any money's involved,

01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:28.020
if it's a kink, then you could just like use it.

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:32.020
And you buy a coffee at a Starbucks.

01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:32.980
It's like, all right.

01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:34.180
Right, but it has to be plausible.

01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:35.860
Like you have to like trick my brain

01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:38.340
into like having it actually be incentivizing for me.

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.580
Two coffees, like a cappuccino or something?

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:42.180
Yeah, like the homeless man bought me a coffee

01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:42.980
and then I sucked his dick.

01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:43.940
Like that's not cool.

01:50:45.060 --> 01:50:45.540
All right.

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:47.540
So no shade of homeless men, by the way,

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:48.820
like I've been friends with a lot of them.

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.980
I'm just using like some sort of stereotype of.

01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:54.740
Yeah, so like it has to be plausible

01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:55.940
where you could trick your mind.

01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:56.500
Interesting.

01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:56.900
Yeah.

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:57.780
I mean, yeah.

01:50:58.740 --> 01:50:59.620
And so that's different.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:02.900
So now in this sort of frame, I am still like,

01:51:02.900 --> 01:51:05.220
I'm accepting money, but still much more expressive

01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:06.340
of my actual preferences.

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:09.620
So like before when I would start escrowing full time,

01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:10.420
I was suppressive.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.460
And now I'm like, you know, I'm doing this for me.

01:51:13.460 --> 01:51:16.020
So we're going to make sure that I have a good time.

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:17.540
And so I'm much more demanding.

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:19.300
And then you're having more fun

01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:21.140
because you're not pretending like laughing at a joke

01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:21.860
or something like that.

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:22.660
That sounds terrible.

01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:26.260
Sounds like it's also like social.

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:29.940
I mean, I guess I would, would I do that?

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:32.580
Like when you first meet people like strangers and so on,

01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:35.940
there's some aspect of like niceties,

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.860
but like, I don't know, intimacy,

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.580
like real intimacy requires like getting past the niceties.

01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:43.620
Like laughing at somebody's joke when it's not funny

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:45.380
feels like anti-intimacy.

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:47.940
Yeah, but I laugh at so many jokes automatically.

01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:50.500
It's interesting because like, I don't mean to,

01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:51.860
I'm not trying to be fake,

01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:53.060
but like if I'm in a group of people

01:51:53.060 --> 01:51:54.500
and somebody makes a joke and everybody laughs,

01:51:54.500 --> 01:51:56.420
I laugh even before I'm checking within myself.

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.940
Like, do I genuinely enjoy this joke?

01:51:58.500 --> 01:51:59.700
So it's like, I don't know,

01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:02.260
like the degree that I am sort of just like a result

01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.740
of social programming in all cases,

01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.500
that like when I'm with a client

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:07.540
back when I was doing it full time,

01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:09.060
like it doesn't feel significantly different.

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.660
It just felt like a different version of myself.

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:12.260
Yeah, that's true.

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:14.740
Yeah, to that degree, to the degree you don't feel

01:52:15.380 --> 01:52:19.620
like you're going against your nature, yeah.

01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.060
Yeah, it was very rare that I actually felt

01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:23.140
like I was going against my nature.

01:52:24.180 --> 01:52:26.100
What about the market of how much to charge?

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:30.740
So 20, 2,400, like how transparent is that market?

01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.780
Is there like a market?

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.300
Like how much can you sell when you're charging that much?

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:37.140
Yeah, no, like what are the competitors?

01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.020
Like if this-

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:38.500
Oh yeah.

01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.180
Like what do you, are you distinctly what,

01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:43.620
because you said it's a lot of is a bit more shrouded

01:52:43.620 --> 01:52:46.180
in mystery, like it's more confidential.

01:52:46.180 --> 01:52:48.500
Like do you have some transparency to the market,

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:49.460
what the competitors are?

01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:51.860
I did a survey of Escort, it's only like 130.

01:52:51.860 --> 01:52:53.540
I'm trying to remember, and the median was around like

01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:57.940
$300, I think, an hour, something like that

01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.540
with a very long tail at the top end.

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:02.420
I'm trying to remember what the, I also asked the amount

01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:03.940
where I could calculate the amount they made per month.

01:53:03.940 --> 01:53:05.940
I think it was like $6,000 or $7,000 a month.

01:53:06.660 --> 01:53:08.100
I need to double check that one, but-

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:09.620
I charge 50 bucks an hour.

01:53:09.620 --> 01:53:11.780
You charge 50 bucks an hour, you should raise your rates.

01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.180
Yeah, I give a really shitty hand job.

01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:18.740
But usually the rates are around, like if you want

01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:21.220
a median Escort in a big city, it's usually $400 to $600.

01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:24.500
A city, so the urban, sorry, $400 to $600?

01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:26.180
In a big city, but like smaller cities,

01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:28.180
you charge, the rates go lower.

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:32.740
That's so fascinating.

01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:35.940
What's like the most you've ever seen somebody charge?

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.540
I think I am.

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:39.540
You're like the-

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:42.260
But at this point, it's because I'm post work.

01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.060
Like I can just put it in the same number.

01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:51.060
Does the fact that you're sort of like a sexuality expert,

01:53:51.060 --> 01:53:54.260
like a researcher and so on, like your mind is fascinating

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:56.580
as well, and you're a bit of a celebrity,

01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:57.860
does that play into it?

01:53:57.860 --> 01:53:59.860
Yeah.

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:01.380
Or do you feel the celebrity now?

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.380
Like when you're with people?

01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.500
Yeah, absolutely.

01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.500
Usually if people are interested in hanging out with me,

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.500
it's because of that.

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:10.500
But that's different.

01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:14.500
Like I think besides the fun part, like this is a kink

01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:16.500
as opposed to this is a job.

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:18.500
Like with this as a job, usually the high end

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.500
is closer to $2,000 an hour.

01:54:20.500 --> 01:54:22.500
Like the very high end.

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:24.500
Have clients ever fallen in love with you?

01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.500
I think so, yeah.

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.500
I think it doesn't, happens to me much less than

01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.500
most other people due to like the fact that

01:54:30.580 --> 01:54:32.580
I think we were talking about before.

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.580
Which is what?

01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:36.580
Where like, you know, you give off vibes,

01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:38.580
maybe like subconscious vibes.

01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.580
But they have fallen in love?

01:54:40.580 --> 01:54:42.580
Or not, but not as often?

01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:44.580
I think something about my signaling indicates

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:46.580
that people should not fall in love with me

01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:48.580
because I don't think it happens very much.

01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.580
It happens a lot with other women, but I know.

01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:52.580
But I have occasionally had,

01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:54.580
the thing is it's hard for me because

01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.580
I try to be as vulnerable as I can

01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:58.580
in a connection with a client.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.660
And like, I do really like some of them.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:02.660
I still remember some of them very fondly

01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.660
and I'm like, I hope they're doing well.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:06.660
And some of them are really profound.

01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.660
Like one guy saw me because he found out

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:10.660
he was dying of cancer and he was like,

01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:12.660
I don't want to die without seeing someone.

01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:14.660
I'm like, Jesus Christ, that's such a,

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.660
I don't know, I'm very touched

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.660
by many of the people that I saw.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:20.660
So there's like deep intimacy there?

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.660
Yeah.

01:55:22.660 --> 01:55:24.660
I know that it's brief and I know that it's like

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:26.660
kind of weird, but like there's

01:55:26.740 --> 01:55:28.740
like a real glimpse into somebody's soul

01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:30.740
when you get to be intimate.

01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:32.740
And I think this is especially true for men

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:34.740
because a lot of time men don't have like a way

01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:36.740
to be really vulnerable in front of anybody.

01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:38.740
But like if you're in bed with a woman

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:40.740
that you find to be attractive,

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.740
you can sort of let loose a little bit more.

01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.740
So they can become vulnerable in general quickly?

01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.740
Yeah, and I really like that.

01:55:46.740 --> 01:55:48.740
I like being as vulnerable as I can to match it.

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.740
Like I'm not forcing myself or anything,

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.740
but like I just feel into it and like

01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:54.740
notice how beautiful the person was

01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.820
being able to be in this intimate experience

01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.820
with them.

01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:00.820
And that was so wonderful.

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.820
Does it ever hurt to say goodbye?

01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.820
No,

01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:06.820
but I think that's as unique to me

01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:08.820
because I like

01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.820
being alone a lot.

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.820
Even with my friends who I like dearly,

01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:14.820
I'm like happy not seeing them.

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.820
Because I don't like making facial expressions

01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.820
very much. But I do miss

01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.820
some of my clients.

01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.820
Wait, sorry. What does making facial expression

01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:24.900
have to do with saying goodbye?

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.900
Well, if you are not with somebody

01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:28.900
in person, you don't have to make facial expressions anymore.

01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:30.900
Oh, you can just

01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.900
think about them.

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.900
Yeah, you can just sit there totally blank face

01:56:34.900 --> 01:56:36.900
and then have all of the emotions that you want.

01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:38.900
Oh, you're telling me.

01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:40.900
Do you have this thing too?

01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:42.900
It's not a thing, but like

01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.900
you're on camera.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:46.900
So like I feel feelings,

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.900
but people usually want, like

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.900
social interaction is such that

01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:52.980
they want me to show feelings on my face.

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:54.980
Yeah, like that. Good job.

01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:56.980
Yeah, there you go.

01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.980
So like I definitely

01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:00.980
there could be just an

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:02.980
introvert thing where you like have a

01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:04.980
vibrant inner world

01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:06.980
that you forget to show

01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:08.980
to the rest of the world. And also

01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.980
I'm scared of social interaction.

01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.980
I just have a lot of anxiety about

01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:14.980
interacting with the external world.

01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:16.980
I'm kind of surprised to hear that because

01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:18.980
when you talked about finding the light

01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:21.060
in everything and everything is fun.

01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:23.060
Like I usually don't associate that with having

01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:25.060
not very much anxiety.

01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:27.060
Well, because I have the

01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:29.060
we mentioned that earlier, I just appreciate

01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:31.060
the beauty in the world when I observe it, but then

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:33.060
when I'm interacting with others

01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:35.060
I have a very

01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:37.060
harsh self-critical aspect to my brain

01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:39.060
that says like, you're going to fuck this up.

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:41.060
You're going to fuck up

01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:43.060
this interaction. You're going to fuck up

01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:45.060
the beauty that's there.

01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:47.060
If I'm sort of being

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.140
fragile and vulnerable for a moment.

01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:51.140
One of the things I'm afraid of, I get so much

01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:53.140
love from people that

01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:55.140
listen or even like reach out

01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:57.140
like you said through the survey, like women and so on.

01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:59.140
I'm afraid that

01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:01.140
yeah, you know, you admire

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:03.140
me because you don't know me

01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:05.140
but you won't admire me once you know me.

01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:07.140
So that's self-critical.

01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:09.140
It's a silly, I mean, as you get older you're like

01:58:09.140 --> 01:58:11.140
yeah, okay. Like

01:58:11.140 --> 01:58:13.140
I'm able to step away and objectively look at myself

01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:15.140
as like there's no

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.220
you're fine, you're good.

01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:19.220
But it's still the

01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:21.220
part of the brain that you can't just shut off.

01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:23.220
What would

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:25.220
fucking up in this conversation look like?

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.220
It doesn't

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.220
have to be rational, but I'm curious

01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.220
if there's a specific thing.

01:58:35.220 --> 01:58:37.220
A lot of it is just

01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:39.220
a feeling, like an amorphous

01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:41.220
fear

01:58:41.220 --> 01:58:43.220
of failure. What it would

01:58:43.300 --> 01:58:45.300
actually look like?

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.340
Maybe because we're talking about sexuality

01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:54.340
me not being able to

01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.340
eloquently explain

01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.340
the world view I have

01:58:58.340 --> 01:59:00.340
and why I appreciate

01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:02.340
it,

01:59:02.340 --> 01:59:04.340
that would make me feel like a

01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:06.340
failure because that would make me feel like

01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:08.340
maybe you don't know what you're doing, right?

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:10.340
Because sexuality

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:12.340
not sexuality, but even romantic relationships

01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:14.340
are really important to happiness.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.340
They're really important to me.

01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:18.340
And I'm not sure like the conception of love

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.340
I have, romantic love

01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:22.340
is like fully

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:24.340
made rigorous.

01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:26.340
So especially when I'm talking to you

01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:28.340
that thinks very rigorously about a lot of

01:59:28.340 --> 01:59:30.340
these topics, I'm not sure if

01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:32.340
I've thought about them a lot.

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:34.340
I feel them. I interact

01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:36.340
with the world in this space of feelings.

01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:38.340
Maybe I'm almost afraid to

01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:40.340
be very rigorous with these kinds of

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:42.340
thoughts.

01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:44.340
And so I think

01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:46.340
the failure would be like

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:48.340
I would be confronted with the fact that I can't

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:50.340
explain what

01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:52.340
makes me happy. That could be a failure.

01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.340
And that could be just a bunch of other failures.

01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:56.340
Another big failure is like

01:59:56.340 --> 01:59:58.340
not

01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.340
I think you're a really brilliant person.

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:02.340
And a lot of folks

02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:04.340
I know and admire

02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:06.340
your work as well.

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.340
So for me not to

02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:10.340
be part of highlighting that brilliance would be

02:00:10.340 --> 02:00:12.340
a failure definitely.

02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:14.340
Because then other people might feel

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:16.340
like notice the discrepancy

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:18.340
or something?

02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:20.340
No, that's not other people. Just my

02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:22.340
personal feeling.

02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:24.340
And the other is like

02:00:24.340 --> 02:00:26.340
jokes because we're talking about sex.

02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:28.340
So for me it's fun to just joke

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.340
around. But you also have to tread

02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:32.340
carefully because

02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:34.340
it's a weird

02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:36.340
surface because

02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.340
I already feel bad about making a joke for

02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:40.340
50 bucks for a hand job that's crappy by

02:00:40.340 --> 02:00:42.340
me.

02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.340
But I think

02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:46.340
I think sometimes you just gotta go for it.

02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:48.340
I went for it.

02:00:48.340 --> 02:00:50.340
It kind of fell flat on his face.

02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:52.340
But

02:00:52.340 --> 02:00:54.340
that's the thing with the conversation.

02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:56.340
I think there's like this fear

02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:58.340
where it's like if you become like scientific

02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:00.340
about something you'll figure out that your feelings are unjustified.

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.340
And then you'll experience this horrible thing

02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:04.340
where like ah shit like I'm like afraid

02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:06.340
of this but I'm sort of being forced to by my logical

02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:08.340
mind to like believe this thing.

02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.340
Which I don't think this is true

02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:12.340
at all. I think like your

02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:14.340
feelings are there for a reason. Like they're for a

02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:16.340
good reason. And like logic

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.340
or like rigorous analysis or something

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:20.340
should be dedicated to figuring out why

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:22.340
it's there. Not that

02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.340
to like suppress it or tell it it

02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:26.340
shouldn't be there. You know? What do you think is more

02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:28.340
important to like

02:01:28.340 --> 02:01:30.340
to just life?

02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:32.340
Reason versus

02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:34.340
emotion.

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:36.340
Not life. To what makes us human.

02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:38.340
I guess.

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:40.340
My romantic narrative

02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.340
answer to this which is like not rigorous at all is

02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:44.340
curiosity.

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:46.340
Curiosity. Yeah.

02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:48.340
Is curiosity

02:01:48.340 --> 02:01:50.340
that's such a middle

02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:52.340
curiosity is like both emotion and reason.

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.340
So it's like this pull

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.340
cause reason is the tool you use

02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:58.340
to figure out the puzzle.

02:01:58.340 --> 02:02:00.340
And then curiosity is the

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:02.340
pull towards the puzzle.

02:02:02.340 --> 02:02:04.340
Yeah. I don't like

02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:06.340
world views that pit like emotion rationalities

02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.340
opposite each other. They feel like

02:02:08.340 --> 02:02:10.340
beautiful parts of like a cohesive whole.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:12.340
Like if you're doing rationality to the extent

02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:14.340
where you're like suppressing some emotional

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:16.340
reactions you have then I think you're doing it wrong. You're like

02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:18.340
missing a big part of it. Like it should be

02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:20.340
like integrated. It should be like part

02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:22.340
of like one unified flow. Like the things

02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:24.340
that you like. If you want to be in a romantic committed relationship

02:02:24.340 --> 02:02:26.340
for the rest of your life then this is like

02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.340
beautiful and good and the kind of

02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.340
logic that you're using to make sense of the world

02:02:30.340 --> 02:02:32.340
should be fitted into that correctly.

02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:34.340
I think that's really cool. Like anytime you have

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.340
sort of like an internal at odds thing with

02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:38.340
it I think you're like using some sort of force

02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.340
to suppress one or the other. Like oh I'm not allowed to

02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:42.340
reason about this or I'm not allowed to feel about that.

02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:44.340
And that feels harsh to me. And I think

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:46.340
curiosity is the solution. Like if

02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:48.340
you're simply just calmly

02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:50.340
curious. Oh why do I feel like that?

02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:52.340
Let's go find out. That's so cool.

02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:54.340
Right? Like you can use logic

02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:56.340
and your feelings to like discover the answer.

02:02:56.340 --> 02:02:58.340
Do you sometimes, because you

02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:00.340
do this kind of technique which is interesting

02:03:00.340 --> 02:03:02.340
and I've mentioned it to others.

02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:04.340
You'll sometimes step away from like a third person

02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.340
perspective and describe the feeling

02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:08.340
you're feeling.

02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:10.340
Or like even just the situation. Like you'll step out

02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:12.340
and talk about

02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:14.340
wait what is happening here?

02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:16.340
Like in the conversation. In the conversation

02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:18.340
itself. Yeah.

02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:20.340
First off what is that?

02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:22.340
Do you find that to be useful and interesting? Because it's

02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.340
very interesting. It feels

02:03:24.340 --> 02:03:26.340
raw and honest. The danger

02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:28.340
of it seems like you escape

02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:30.340
the actual experience of

02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:32.340
it though. So that's the trade off.

02:03:32.340 --> 02:03:34.340
You make it intellectual

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:36.340
right? Is it though

02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:38.340
intellectual to do that?

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:40.340
I mean maybe it is.

02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:42.340
I don't mean to.

02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:44.340
No. Maybe that's the wrong word.

02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:46.340
You can make it intellectual. Yeah.

02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:48.340
But you can still continue the same flavor

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:50.340
because you're not fully disengaging from the conversation.

02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.340
You're doing

02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:54.340
you're just creating an extra metal

02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:56.340
layer. Yeah. I think

02:03:56.340 --> 02:03:58.340
exploring the emotional reaction to what's going on

02:03:58.340 --> 02:04:00.340
in the moment. Yeah.

02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.340
In some ways it's actually making it stronger.

02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:04.340
Or enriching

02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:06.340
it. Like making it more

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.340
giving it more context. Giving it deeper

02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:12.340
understanding. I think there's like a way of going

02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:14.340
meta that is a flinch move.

02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:16.340
Like oh I noticed that we're doing this thing. I'm going to name

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.340
it. And I think the thing that I described earlier

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:20.340
like when the homeless guy approached me and asked

02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.340
you know can you go home with me? And I was like

02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.340
oh are you trying to have sex with me right now?

02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:26.340
Like what I was doing was like a meta move. Like you're stepping outside

02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:28.340
and like okay what is the purpose of this conversation?

02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:30.340
And we explicitly identify it. And in that

02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.340
case I think that is sort of like a flinch move.

02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.340
Like I'm not telling

02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:36.340
him my emotional response. I'm not like being

02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:38.340
fully present. I'm like sort of identifying

02:04:38.340 --> 02:04:40.340
it as a way to subvert what's going

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.340
on. And I absolutely think this is a possible

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.340
thing. But I usually try to be

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:46.340
aware of that myself and it depends on the purpose

02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.340
of what's going on. That guy. Because that

02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.340
is actually like a chess move you did.

02:04:50.340 --> 02:04:52.340
You had a purpose with that chess move.

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:54.340
But the flirtation is on.

02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:56.340
Like he could have

02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.340
like done a better move

02:04:58.340 --> 02:05:00.340
that would make you like curious.

02:05:00.340 --> 02:05:02.340
Like huh.

02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:04.340
Like interesting. Because you had an agenda

02:05:04.340 --> 02:05:06.340
with that. But he

02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:08.340
could have changed your mind.

02:05:08.340 --> 02:05:10.340
He could have with a few words

02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:12.340
because you just created extra layers,

02:05:12.340 --> 02:05:14.340
extra entry points. If he had gotten

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:16.340
more meta he might have been like okay

02:05:16.340 --> 02:05:18.340
well now I am going to sleep with you.

02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:20.340
Exactly.

02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:22.340
See there is something

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:24.340
that aids into the chemistry of the

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:26.340
conversation when you do that meta. I really enjoy it.

02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.340
It's like a rare. I forget

02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:30.340
I forget who

02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:32.340
I've had a few people do that

02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.340
with me. Like just in conversation.

02:05:34.340 --> 02:05:36.340
And I feel like you were involved somehow

02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:38.340
because I've met you before.

02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.340
Somewhere. I don't know if we

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:42.340
were. We were in a couple parties

02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:44.340
together. Or maybe it was just like a bunch of

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:46.340
people that kind of play

02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:48.340
with the same. Or like a couple. It's circling.

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:50.340
It's just a practice explicitly

02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.340
dedicated towards that. What's circling?

02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:54.340
That might be the thing. Yeah I think

02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.340
we know we have some mutual circlers in our

02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:58.340
networks here.

02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:00.340
What's circling? I don't

02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:02.340
remember what's circling. I'm going to describe it horribly

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:04.340
because it's like one of those things that's difficult to describe

02:06:04.340 --> 02:06:06.340
unless you experience it. Kind of like drugs.

02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:08.340
But it's something like you sit around. There's like

02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:10.340
kind of guidelines to the conversation

02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:12.340
where you talk about the present moment. And you're like honest

02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:14.340
about your experiences as much as you can be. And if you don't

02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.340
want to be honest then you say, I don't want to be honest.

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:18.340
And it's your

02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:20.340
commitment to connection. So you're here to actually

02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:22.340
connect with the other person. Understand them and be understood.

02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:24.340
You're not supposed to

02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:26.340
project. So if you have an analysis

02:06:26.340 --> 02:06:28.340
about the other person, you own it. You're like

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.340
I'm experiencing you as this.

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:32.340
And then you check if it's true.

02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:34.340
Are you

02:06:34.340 --> 02:06:36.340
supposed to be almost like converting into words

02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:38.340
the thing you're thinking? Like constantly?

02:06:38.340 --> 02:06:40.340
Are you supposed to say what you're thinking?

02:06:40.340 --> 02:06:42.340
It feels right in the moment you can.

02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:44.340
The thing is it's very amorphous. It's almost like

02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:46.340
creating a magical sensation. And I've been with

02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:48.340
I've seen some very good circlers. Really high

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:50.340
skill circle. And I feel like I'm on drugs

02:06:50.340 --> 02:06:52.340
when that happens. It's very rare to see.

02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:54.340
Does it feel honest

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:56.340
somehow? Yeah, very honest.

02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:58.340
Like right now in this

02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:00.340
moment I'm feeling kind of

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:02.340
nervous energy because I'm talking to you

02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.340
and this is a unique situation.

02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:06.340
And I want you to think I'm cool. I want

02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:08.340
everybody listening to me to think I'm cool. But I'm also

02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.340
having some sort of delight at being able

02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:12.340
to express in this way.

02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:14.340
And like some admiration for how you like set up

02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:16.340
and built this thing that I can be a part

02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:18.340
of. And all of these things are sort of in my

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:20.340
body right now is this sort of vibrating high

02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:22.340
thing. I remember like in the party

02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:24.340
setting, because I've had to talk to a few people,

02:07:24.340 --> 02:07:26.340
I felt like it was going sexual very quickly.

02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:28.340
Okay, I

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.340
don't know if you remember this, but the first time

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:32.340
I met you I didn't know who you were. I just heard

02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:34.340
I knew I'd heard your name. Like you'd heard your name and I was like

02:07:34.340 --> 02:07:36.340
I think I've heard people discuss that. And

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:38.340
I was in the middle of a very sexual conversation with

02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:40.340
another woman. Oh, you were? Yeah, I was. And you

02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:42.340
just like turned around and left very shortly afterwards

02:07:42.340 --> 02:07:44.340
and I thought it was very... Oh, was I listening in on

02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:46.340
the conversation or something like that? I think it was like I was

02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:48.340
talking to her and you were just kind of like right there. And so

02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.340
we introduced ourselves and then we continued on with the conversation.

02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:52.340
You were like standing there and listening.

02:07:52.340 --> 02:07:54.340
I don't think I would have left the cut. So it's

02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:56.340
funny you probably interpret it in a different

02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:58.340
way. I interpret it as you

02:07:58.340 --> 02:08:00.340
like not wanting to listen to like graphic

02:08:00.340 --> 02:08:02.340
sexual stuff. Was it like super graphic?

02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:04.340
I don't know. I was asking her about, I was doing

02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:06.340
I was interviewing her about her fetish basically.

02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:08.340
Oh, yeah. I don't think I would have walked away from that.

02:08:08.340 --> 02:08:10.340
I would have been like curious. Oh, interesting

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:12.340
because I don't often see people having a

02:08:12.340 --> 02:08:14.340
a deep interview about fetishes.

02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:16.340
Like I wouldn't even be, listen, I'm like

02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:18.340
Jane Goodall here.

02:08:18.340 --> 02:08:20.340
I'm not like

02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:22.340
I'm not afraid of sexuality or something

02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:24.340
like that. I just have certain values in terms of like

02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.340
monogamy and so on. But I think

02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:28.340
sexuality is really beautiful. Yeah.

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.340
I don't think

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:32.340
yeah, I can't imagine

02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:34.340
myself walking away from that conversation.

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:36.340
Somebody must have called you or something. I didn't remember

02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:38.340
exactly how it worked. I just remember thinking

02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:40.340
later on. Or maybe I thought I was intruding.

02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:42.340
Oh, maybe.

02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:44.340
I was kind of drunk. So

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:46.340
I probably was very drunk too.

02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.340
I would like to actually have like

02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:50.340
footage of that conversation so we can actually

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:52.340
interpret what actually happened because it's probably

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.340
I mean

02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:56.340
human interactions are funny

02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:58.340
like that. They can

02:08:58.340 --> 02:09:00.340
happen for all kinds of reasons.

02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:02.340
Have you ever fallen in love with a client?

02:09:02.340 --> 02:09:04.340
No. I mean like

02:09:04.340 --> 02:09:06.340
in tiny ways, like micro loves.

02:09:06.340 --> 02:09:08.340
Have you ever fallen in love

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.340
love? I mean

02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.340
I don't know what it means, but probably. The thing

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:14.340
that other people say when they say fall in love is probably

02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.340
something I've experienced.

02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:18.340
What do you think they mean?

02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:20.340
What is love?

02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:22.340
Ayla? Yeah, I know. No?

02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:24.340
Fantastic question. I think love is one of those words that

02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:26.340
refers to like a billion different concepts.

02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:28.340
And I think we maybe should just taboo

02:09:28.340 --> 02:09:30.340
the term to have a better understanding of what we're referring to.

02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:32.340
Because there's things like feeling intense

02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.340
attachment. There's something feeling like

02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:36.340
soulfully aligned. There's like sexual attraction.

02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:38.340
There's like excitement. Are you talking to me

02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:40.340
and saying we should taboo the term

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:42.340
love in this conversation?

02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.340
How dare you?

02:09:48.340 --> 02:09:50.340
Romantic love.

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:52.340
To make it flourish into lots of other new definitions.

02:09:52.340 --> 02:09:54.340
Okay, thank you.

02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:56.340
It sounds like you're censoring

02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.340
the most important word.

02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:00.340
This is like 1984 all over again.

02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:02.340
Okay.

02:10:02.340 --> 02:10:04.340
Also on the book reading list.

02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:06.340
Listen.

02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:08.340
No, romantic love, like a deep intimacy for

02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.340
somebody else. Like a deep connection with

02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:12.340
a human being that is also

02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:14.340
I mean yeah, with polyamory

02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.340
it's tricky.

02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.340
And your relationship with sex is also

02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:20.340
tricky. So like what's the difference

02:10:20.340 --> 02:10:22.340
between a deep friendship

02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:24.340
and a

02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:26.340
friendship that also has a sexual component?

02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:28.340
I remember being very confused about that

02:10:28.340 --> 02:10:30.340
when I did a lot of LSD. I was like

02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:32.340
what? The line

02:10:32.340 --> 02:10:34.340
between romantic relationships and everything else

02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:36.340
kind of got blurred. I was like oh I'm just like in

02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:38.340
intimacy. And some intimacies

02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:40.340
mean that you spend your life together more and have

02:10:40.340 --> 02:10:42.340
sex. But like

02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:44.340
the same basic thing is there.

02:10:44.340 --> 02:10:46.340
Like you're seeing someone for who they

02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:48.340
are. Do you think you can be

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:50.340
if you're heterosexual, do you think you could

02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:52.340
be really deeply close with

02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:54.340
friends with a guy and not have sexual

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:56.340
relationships with him?

02:10:56.340 --> 02:10:58.340
I assume it's possible. Like if

02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:00.340
anything is ever possible then probably

02:11:00.340 --> 02:11:02.340
yeah. Like everything

02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.340
is possible. Time travel is possible.

02:11:04.340 --> 02:11:06.340
Quantum mechanics makes everything

02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.340
traveling faster than the speed of light is possible

02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:10.340
according to general relativity.

02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:12.340
Everything is possible. So you're saying

02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:14.340
there's a chance. Dumb and Dumber has

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:16.340
taught me that everything is fucking

02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:18.340
possible. It's probably not super likely

02:11:18.340 --> 02:11:20.340
assuming that they are like attracted to each other.

02:11:20.340 --> 02:11:22.340
Yeah.

02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:24.340
And for somebody that has surveys and statistical

02:11:24.340 --> 02:11:26.340
analysis

02:11:26.340 --> 02:11:28.340
we're interested in like

02:11:28.340 --> 02:11:30.340
what's the likely thing here versus

02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:32.340
what's possible. If you say possible it's like

02:11:32.340 --> 02:11:34.340
anything's open. Did you just avoid

02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.340
answering the love thing? I have a lot to say about

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:38.340
love. I just need to be precise.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:40.340
Yeah okay let's be

02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.340
precisely and precise and continue.

02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:44.340
Sorry that's my phone.

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:46.340
Uh

02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:48.340
It feels like a passive

02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:50.340
aggressive suggestion that we shouldn't

02:11:50.340 --> 02:11:52.340
talk about love anymore but we shall continue.

02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:54.340
No we should absolutely talk about love. It's just

02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:56.340
the term is very confusing. Because it's like

02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:58.340
some people say the word love and the thing that they're

02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:00.340
thinking of is like oh the butterfly

02:12:00.340 --> 02:12:02.340
is like the sparkle thing that I get

02:12:02.340 --> 02:12:04.340
in my stomach when I think about my loved one. But

02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:06.340
I study relationships over time. I just

02:12:06.340 --> 02:12:08.340
like I did a survey about it and that

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:10.340
sparkle goes away within like two to four years.

02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:12.340
But people still report loving

02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.340
their partner after that. So I'm like okay like when you

02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:16.340
say the word love what the fuck are we talking about?

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.340
Yeah. I just want to get on the same page.

02:12:18.340 --> 02:12:20.340
Okay. So what are the different

02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:22.340
so the butterflies

02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:24.340
boy I'd like to push back on

02:12:24.340 --> 02:12:26.340
two to four years on the butterflies but okay. I mean

02:12:26.340 --> 02:12:28.340
statistically. Not everybody.

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.340
Butterflies don't

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.340
give a fuck about statistics. You ever heard of the

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:34.340
like the flap

02:12:34.340 --> 02:12:36.340
of a butterfly wing causing like

02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:38.340
nuclear war?

02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:40.340
How do you describe that with your statistics?

02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:42.340
Okay.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.340
The butterflies that's

02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:46.340
the basic infatuation

02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:48.340
the chemistry of the initial interactions

02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:50.340
sure. But a deep meaningful

02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:52.340
connection like

02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:54.340
that feels

02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:56.340
like sexuality is

02:12:56.340 --> 02:12:58.340
a component of that. Like

02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:00.340
the kind of intimacy that's only possible

02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:02.340
when you're also sexual with another human being.

02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:04.340
On top of that you have the

02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:06.340
butterfly and on top of that you have the friendship

02:13:06.340 --> 02:13:08.340
and on top of that you have like

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:10.340
what is that? That's a sandwich

02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:12.340
full of things. That's the love sandwich. The love sandwich.

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:14.340
Okay. I'm down to call it a love sandwich. Okay.

02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.340
We'll just call it a sandwich.

02:13:16.340 --> 02:13:18.340
L-S. Okay.

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.340
What role does that play

02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:22.340
in the human condition?

02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:24.340
Like. You keep asking about the human

02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:26.340
condition. It's an interesting phrase.

02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:28.340
Yeah. I'm like

02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.340
this is not a phrase that's common in my own thinking.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.340
Sure. Human condition

02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.340
is a good summary

02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:36.340
and you know what do you

02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:38.340
think? What do you feel

02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:40.340
when I say human condition? I think it asks very different kinds

02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:42.340
of questions than you. Sure.

02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:44.340
Yeah. Which is interesting. I've been trying to like figure

02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.340
out like what kind of brain that you have

02:13:46.340 --> 02:13:48.340
is like creating like this category

02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:50.340
of question. Which is why I was like saying like there's something about

02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.340
poetic narrative in there. Yeah. Because it's

02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:54.340
very like

02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:56.340
like aesthetic. I think you've asked much more aesthetic

02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.340
questions than I do. I don't even

02:13:58.340 --> 02:14:00.340
know what the word aesthetic means really. Like artistic.

02:14:00.340 --> 02:14:02.340
Artistic. Yeah.

02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:04.340
I mean I know what aesthetic means

02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:06.340
but I also don't know what it means. It's kind of like the word love.

02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:08.340
Oh.

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:10.340
Aesthetic perspective. Yeah.

02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:12.340
But part of it in conversation

02:14:12.340 --> 02:14:14.340
you don't want to ask a question that has an

02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.340
answer. Fully.

02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:18.340
Always. Like do you have an example

02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:20.340
of a question that has an answer? What's the meaning of oh

02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:22.340
has an answer? Yeah.

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:24.340
Like one that you'd say is like ah that's like a bad question because it has

02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:26.340
an answer. How many sexual partners

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:28.340
you had in the last year?

02:14:28.340 --> 02:14:30.340
Oh my god. That's such a

02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:32.340
Okay. I feel like we just like got to some sort

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:34.340
of crux about like the kinds of questions that we like to answer.

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:36.340
Sure.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:38.340
Because I would love that question. Okay. Right.

02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:40.340
To ask enough people. All right. But does

02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:42.340
that really tell the story? Okay.

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.340
Of what you've felt

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.340
over the past year?

02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:48.340
That's true. But then I could just tell you. Okay.

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.340
So by when you're saying the kinds

02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:52.340
of questions that you like, the ones that don't have an answer, by not

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.340
an answer you mean like not an answer

02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:56.340
where you can

02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:58.340
know that you're done telling it.

02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:00.340
That you can escape having to

02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.340
think by actually answering it.

02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:04.340
I see.

02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:06.340
Yeah. The struggle

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.340
is the place

02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:10.340
where we discover something.

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:12.340
Not the destination.

02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:14.340
Yeah.

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:16.340
It's working. It's working. Okay.

02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:18.340
So what is the role of the love sandwich in

02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:20.340
the human condition? Okay. That's fine.

02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:22.340
I take that question. It's a stupid question.

02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:24.340
You don't have to. I'm ready to try.

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:26.340
Do you like love?

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:28.340
Do you personally like love? Yeah.

02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:30.340
I mean, I think there's a part of me

02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:32.340
that feels like I have unconditional love for all things.

02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:34.340
Like when you're talking about the class being

02:15:34.340 --> 02:15:36.340
beautiful. I felt that.

02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:38.340
It felt like it rang

02:15:38.340 --> 02:15:40.340
something that I have a similar

02:15:40.340 --> 02:15:42.340
resonance in me for that. If I were to circle

02:15:42.340 --> 02:15:44.340
right now

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:46.340
I feel like you're avoiding

02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:48.340
the love question.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.340
The love sandwich question.

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:52.340
What's your own personal

02:15:52.340 --> 02:15:54.340
feeling towards loving another human being

02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:56.340
versus having sex with another human being?

02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:58.340
I

02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:00.340
think

02:16:00.340 --> 02:16:02.340
love is like one of the concepts

02:16:02.340 --> 02:16:04.340
that dissolved for me a long time ago. So I have difficulty

02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:06.340
directly answering it. But I have

02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:08.340
the experience. When you described the love sandwich, I feel

02:16:08.340 --> 02:16:10.340
like I have had that experience.

02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:12.340
I have it currently for some people.

02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:14.340
Also, like I'm dating

02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:16.340
people and I have that. So people who

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:18.340
you date, you would describe

02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:20.340
sharing a love

02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:22.340
sandwich with them. Yeah.

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:24.340
Okay. So how does

02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:26.340
that feel?

02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:28.340
I mean, that's great to hear.

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:30.340
Are you afraid of love?

02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:32.340
No, not at all.

02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:34.340
So can you

02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:36.340
describe to me

02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:38.340
polyamory? What is it?

02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:40.340
What does it mean? Because there's like different terms

02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:42.340
so you have a nice blog post about it.

02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:44.340
Yeah, I have a personal definition of it

02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:46.340
which I readily admit is not shared by a lot of

02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:48.340
people. But to me the definition of polyamory

02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:50.340
is simply not forbidding your partner

02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.340
from pursuing intimacy with others.

02:16:52.340 --> 02:16:54.340
Yeah. It doesn't mean that you have to pursue it

02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.340
personally. Like two people could be

02:16:56.340 --> 02:16:58.340
married and only have had sex with each other for 20

02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:00.340
years. And as long as they're like, you know what?

02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:02.340
If ever you want to go have sex with somebody else, you're welcome to do that.

02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:04.340
Well, the interesting thing you said is that

02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:06.340
doesn't mean they have to do it. They just have the freedom

02:17:06.340 --> 02:17:08.340
to do it. Yeah. It's the freedom that matters

02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:10.340
to me.

02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:12.340
Which is

02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:14.340
I mean, it's called the polyamory post.

02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:16.340
It has so many good blog posts.

02:17:16.340 --> 02:17:18.340
People should just go look at your

02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.340
read your writing because it's

02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:22.340
really, really strong and often backed by data.

02:17:22.340 --> 02:17:24.340
But also just a deeply honest

02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:26.340
look at yourself

02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:28.340
and your understanding of the world.

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.340
It's

02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.340
refreshing

02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:34.340
to be like

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:36.340
with a lot of stuff I disagree with. But I feel like

02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:38.340
if I disagree with it, you'll be

02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:40.340
very open arguing and kind of

02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:42.340
thinking through it. There's just

02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:44.340
an honesty that radiates from the whole thing.

02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:46.340
Anyway, so

02:17:46.340 --> 02:17:48.340
it would be interesting to kind of explore

02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:50.340
polyamory, like how it works. What are the different

02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:52.340
versions? What is the

02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:54.340
freedom look like?

02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:56.340
What does that freedom feel like

02:17:56.340 --> 02:17:58.340
to be able to go

02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:00.340
see other people? Depends on you.

02:18:00.340 --> 02:18:02.340
Do you want to go see other people?

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:04.340
Maybe you do. Maybe you don't.

02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:06.340
Usually for me, I tend to be pretty

02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:08.340
happy with one or a few people.

02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:10.340
And then occasionally I like

02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:12.340
some novelties. So usually I'll go like

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:14.340
I host orgy sometimes. So

02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:16.340
I'll host an orgy and then I'll go have sex with people at the orgy.

02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:18.340
And that'll be good for the novelty for a while.

02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:20.340
Can I ask you about orgies?

02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:22.340
So how many people are at an orgy?

02:18:22.340 --> 02:18:24.340
What's like a standard

02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:26.340
we're having a Sunday picnic and it's an orgy.

02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:28.340
What's like a number of people at an orgy?

02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:30.340
I've only recently

02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:32.340
started hosting orgies, but I have been to a lot of

02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:34.340
orgies. I would say like the median is

02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:36.340
maybe fifteen people.

02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:38.340
I like how you say median versus mean.

02:18:38.340 --> 02:18:40.340
Okay. Median is fifteen people.

02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:42.340
What's the gender distribution usually?

02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:44.340
Usually about

02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:46.340
even. It's like ideal if you can get more women

02:18:46.340 --> 02:18:48.340
than men in most of them. I've recently

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.340
been hosting free use orgies or

02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:52.340
orgies where consent is assumed

02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:54.340
by default when you enter. And of course you can

02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:56.340
revoke it any time or go over a whole bunch of rules

02:18:56.340 --> 02:18:58.340
to make sure it's very safe. You like have wristbands

02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:00.340
so nobody's actually doing anything they

02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:02.340
don't want to. But in those

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:04.340
ones you have to have more men than women.

02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:06.340
I thought free use was like

02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:08.340
consensual

02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:10.340
like at any time.

02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:12.340
But it's at any time within the constraints

02:19:12.340 --> 02:19:14.340
of this building or something like that.

02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:16.340
Yeah, so at the orgies it's like you

02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.340
by entering, if you wear a wristband

02:19:18.340 --> 02:19:20.340
then you are

02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:22.340
by default opting into consent.

02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:24.340
So people don't have to do a thing where they

02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.340
negotiate with you and be like is this

02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:28.340
okay? It's just the default is like

02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:30.340
you just go for it. And if they want

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:32.340
you to stop they say the safe word like red, don't

02:19:32.340 --> 02:19:34.340
and then you have to stop.

02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.340
And we do like exercise in the beginning, people saying

02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:38.340
red to make sure that everybody knows exactly

02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:40.340
what the rules are. What's your favorite safe word?

02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:42.340
Red. When I first started

02:19:42.340 --> 02:19:44.340
doing like weird kinky shit I was like

02:19:44.340 --> 02:19:46.340
oh let's make a safe word and we picked the word

02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:48.340
foliage. I was like that's goofy

02:19:48.340 --> 02:19:50.340
right? And then but then

02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:52.340
eventually came a time where I did actually

02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:54.340
in fact want to say the safe word and I couldn't

02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:56.340
I was like in agony I was

02:19:56.340 --> 02:19:58.340
like crying like I can't make myself

02:19:58.340 --> 02:20:00.340
say this stupid word right now.

02:20:00.340 --> 02:20:02.340
Foliage. So after

02:20:02.340 --> 02:20:04.340
that I was like red doesn't matter I don't care it's not

02:20:04.340 --> 02:20:06.340
funny we're just going with very simple

02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:08.340
practical. How does an orgie

02:20:08.340 --> 02:20:10.340
compare sexually to like a

02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:12.340
one-on-one sexual experience?

02:20:14.340 --> 02:20:16.340
Like what is it same

02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:18.340
ballpark or is it fundamentally different?

02:20:18.340 --> 02:20:20.340
I mean the experience of both orgies

02:20:20.340 --> 02:20:22.340
and one-on-one sex can be like really

02:20:22.340 --> 02:20:24.340
high variety. But you kind of

02:20:24.340 --> 02:20:26.340
it's a little bit like you're having sex with someone

02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:28.340
but you're surrounded by really realistic VR

02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:30.340
porn of other people having sex.

02:20:30.340 --> 02:20:32.340
And sometimes it's like three sums also

02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:34.340
like maybe there's another person involved.

02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.340
But it's hard to like have a whole bunch of people

02:20:36.340 --> 02:20:38.340
in one cluster because usually

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.340
there's kind of different little clusters of people

02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:42.340
having their experience. I once was part

02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:44.340
of a ten woman

02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:46.340
orgie. It was a total lesbian

02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:48.340
thing and that felt like a writhing cluster

02:20:48.340 --> 02:20:50.340
was very nice. But

02:20:50.340 --> 02:20:52.340
typically you kind of separate out with like

02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:54.340
very small pods of people doing stuff.

02:20:54.340 --> 02:20:56.340
Okay. So back to polyamory

02:20:56.340 --> 02:20:58.340
so what's a good

02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:00.340
what does it take to manage? Do you have

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:02.340
a main partner if you're being polyamorous

02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:04.340
and you're dating multiple people?

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:06.340
Is there usually a main one for you personally?

02:21:06.340 --> 02:21:08.340
For me personally

02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:10.340
kind of yes like right now I kind of too

02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:12.340
that aren't like I see roughly

02:21:12.340 --> 02:21:14.340
for me it's kind of just descriptive like

02:21:14.340 --> 02:21:16.340
if I just happen to be seeing you a lot more

02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:18.340
and I confide in you more than you like

02:21:18.340 --> 02:21:20.340
you're descriptively my primary partner.

02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:22.340
But I don't usually have rules to protect that.

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.340
I'm down with rules to protect it if you're

02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:26.340
like you're trying to build something like if I buy a house together I'd be like

02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:28.340
okay we need to like whatever our relationship is we have to

02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:30.340
do the thing where we're both paying the rent for the house

02:21:30.340 --> 02:21:32.340
or the mortgage or whatever.

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:34.340
A lot of people do have primaries so that's very common

02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:36.340
to have like like prescriptive

02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:38.340
like I'm going to get married to you and you're not allowed to like have anal sex

02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:40.340
with anybody else. That sort of thing.

02:21:40.340 --> 02:21:42.340
What about like the transparency in the communication

02:21:42.340 --> 02:21:44.340
that you have to do? Do you usually

02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:46.340
try to be super honest about it? Extremely yeah.

02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:48.340
I mean I've learned over time that like

02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:50.340
even if it seems like a very small thing you

02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:52.340
talk about the small thing. Because often I would

02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:54.340
just sort of have like a small twitch in myself like

02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:56.340
I don't know if I like that. But I'd be like okay this is really minor

02:21:56.340 --> 02:21:58.340
it's probably nothing

02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:00.340
and if I talk about it it's going to make it into a thing

02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:02.340
and I just don't want to make it into a thing you know?

02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:04.340
And I would I've come to realize that

02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:06.340
it's worth making it into a thing. Because I can't predict

02:22:06.340 --> 02:22:08.340
at the time if like the small feeling I have is

02:22:08.340 --> 02:22:10.340
going to grow. And then when I grow it now it's like

02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:12.340
much more difficult to deal with.

02:22:12.340 --> 02:22:14.340
So now it's like any little bit of

02:22:14.340 --> 02:22:16.340
jealousy I have immediately communicated. I'm like ah

02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:18.340
I'm a little jealous of you right now. I don't hold

02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:20.340
that in at all. I used to be kind of like

02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:22.340
back when I first started being poly

02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:24.340
I used to try to pretend that I was not a jealous person

02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:26.340
and that backfired quite a lot.

02:22:26.340 --> 02:22:28.340
That's really interesting. So you do still feel jealousy.

02:22:28.340 --> 02:22:30.340
Yeah definitely. And like

02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:32.340
it's also interesting that you kind of recommend when there's

02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.340
a little bit of jealousy like to

02:22:34.340 --> 02:22:36.340
bring that to the surface. Yeah just like

02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:38.340
excessively communicate. Even if it feels

02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:40.340
stupid. Like this is I feel

02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:42.340
like a cliche. I feel like a

02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:44.340
stupid therapist training video. Like I just

02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:46.340
feel ridiculous sometimes when I'm saying the

02:22:46.340 --> 02:22:48.340
things. But it's just it's I've learned over time it's

02:22:48.340 --> 02:22:50.340
just important to just say the things. Because like you know

02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:52.340
the traditional view of jealousy is exactly

02:22:52.340 --> 02:22:54.340
like you said if you bring it up to the surface

02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.340
like it's going to sound like you're

02:22:56.340 --> 02:22:58.340
overreacting to everything.

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:00.340
But you're saying like still do it.

02:23:00.340 --> 02:23:02.340
Because you're basically your brain

02:23:02.340 --> 02:23:04.340
blows stuff out

02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:06.340
of proportion. Yeah

02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:08.340
and it's good to like be going through it with a partner.

02:23:08.340 --> 02:23:10.340
Like I have a partner right now who's

02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:12.340
like dating this other girl and he like really likes

02:23:12.340 --> 02:23:14.340
her and you know like went traveling with her and stuff. And I was

02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:16.340
like I feel jealous about it. And I have to

02:23:16.340 --> 02:23:18.340
tell him that. And that way he can be with me in it.

02:23:18.340 --> 02:23:20.340
He like holds me when I'm feeling

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:22.340
jealous. And it's like a bonding

02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:24.340
experience you know. But it's important

02:23:24.340 --> 02:23:26.340
for me that he's able to handle it. Like I

02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:28.340
try not to date people who really freak out

02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:30.340
when I have negative emotions. Because I want to be

02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:32.340
able to express that I'm upset by something

02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:34.340
they're doing without it being

02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:36.340
taken as a demand that they change their behavior.

02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:38.340
Right so he has to be able to

02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:40.340
skillfully handle the interaction.

02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:42.340
He has to be like cool alright you're jealous. Like I'm not

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:44.340
going to freak out about it. I'm not going to change my behavior. I'm just going to

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:46.340
be with you in that. We're going to sit in it together.

02:23:48.340 --> 02:23:50.340
I mean it's some of that just insecurity that

02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:52.340
he should also just comfort like

02:23:52.340 --> 02:23:54.340
basically alleviate your insecurity.

02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:56.340
Bring you back to like a rational objective evaluation.

02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:58.340
My relationships I love

02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:00.340
it when people do not reassure me. I like not

02:24:00.340 --> 02:24:02.340
being comforted quite a lot.

02:24:02.340 --> 02:24:04.340
And so usually the people I date don't.

02:24:04.340 --> 02:24:06.340
I'm very gravitating. Like it's one of the things

02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:08.340
people do to make me fall in love with them is if I say something

02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:10.340
really like terrible. And they're just like

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:12.340
do not give me any comfort whatsoever.

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:14.340
Like that's where my heart gets

02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:16.340
captured. So I typically am in relationships

02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:18.340
where I'm like oh man I'm so jealous. And they just

02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:20.340
like do not reassure me at all.

02:24:20.340 --> 02:24:22.340
And that's good because it doesn't give me an out.

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.340
Like I have to deal with it myself.

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:26.340
Like maybe it is true that the other

02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:28.340
woman is better than me. Like maybe that is

02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:30.340
an actual possible reality. And I don't want to be

02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:32.340
dealing with my life in a way where I'm like

02:24:32.340 --> 02:24:34.340
pretending like I'm only okay when that

02:24:34.340 --> 02:24:36.340
reality is not true.

02:24:36.340 --> 02:24:38.340
Would you like them to say that?

02:24:38.340 --> 02:24:40.340
That the other woman is better than you?

02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:42.340
If they feel that?

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:44.340
I mean they should say it according to themselves.

02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:46.340
Like oh I prefer like I have a better

02:24:46.340 --> 02:24:48.340
time with her than I have with you than I would want to know that.

02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:50.340
And even though that might be

02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:52.340
painful to hear?

02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:54.340
Yes.

02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:56.340
That which can be destroyed by the truth should be.

02:24:56.340 --> 02:24:58.340
That which can be

02:24:58.340 --> 02:25:00.340
destroyed by the truth. What is that?

02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:02.340
That your ego or something like that?

02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:04.340
My ego.

02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:06.340
So your ego just generally grows and you like

02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.340
the destruction of it.

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:10.340
So the process of truth.

02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:12.340
It's not like a fun experience. I've had guys be like

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:14.340
well you're not as pretty as I'd like.

02:25:14.340 --> 02:25:16.340
I'm just like oh!

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:18.340
But then also like give me your number after.

02:25:18.340 --> 02:25:20.340
Yeah.

02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:24.340
Oh man.

02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:26.340
That's kind of beautiful.

02:25:26.340 --> 02:25:28.340
What do you think of monogamous

02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:30.340
relationships? Like philosophically?

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.340
Can you maybe

02:25:32.340 --> 02:25:34.340
steal that or make the case for monogamous

02:25:34.340 --> 02:25:36.340
relationships?

02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.340
Can you understand the pros and cons of monogamous

02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:40.340
relationships?

02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:42.340
If you're like hey

02:25:42.340 --> 02:25:44.340
you can do whatever you want but you and I are going to spend

02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:46.340
time together.

02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:48.340
Like you're 80 years old and like oh we spent 60 years

02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:50.340
in a marriage together. We've never had sex with anybody else.

02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:52.340
I think that's like awesome. That's what you want. That's great.

02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:54.340
I have like a little bit more problems with

02:25:54.340 --> 02:25:56.340
people doing that while also forcing

02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:58.340
their partner not to misbehave if they want

02:25:58.340 --> 02:26:00.340
to. Like if you're like oh

02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:02.340
we only made it this far in a monogamous relationship

02:26:02.340 --> 02:26:04.340
because I forced my partner not to pursue

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.340
an intimacy that she wanted to.

02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:08.340
Then I feel like a little more like

02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:10.340
I don't know if that's great.

02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:12.340
How do you know if it's a real want for an intimacy?

02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.340
Like checking out an attractive

02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:16.340
person while being inside a monogamous

02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:18.340
relationship. Yeah how do you score that?

02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.340
Is that bad that the person cannot pursue

02:26:20.340 --> 02:26:22.340
those feelings?

02:26:22.340 --> 02:26:24.340
I mean it depends if they want to.

02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:26.340
I often find people attractive if I don't want to pursue.

02:26:28.340 --> 02:26:30.340
I'm also okay with people entering into

02:26:30.340 --> 02:26:32.340
agreements. Like if you and I want

02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:34.340
to agree, like I'm only going to enter

02:26:34.340 --> 02:26:36.340
this because I'm going to be so hurt if you pursue

02:26:36.340 --> 02:26:38.340
somebody else. So I'm not going to pursue anybody else.

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:40.340
That seems fine to me. But I also extend

02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:42.340
that. Like if somebody's like I don't want you

02:26:42.340 --> 02:26:44.340
to have any friends. I'm going to feel really insecure if you

02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:46.340
and like okay like if you want to enter

02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:48.340
that agreement like I feel the same way. Like I think you should have

02:26:48.340 --> 02:26:50.340
the right to do it if this is what you want.

02:26:50.340 --> 02:26:52.340
But I also kind of I feel like a little weird about restricting

02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:54.340
your partner from doing things you know.

02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:56.340
Oh but I guess if you're honest about it and you put it on the table

02:26:58.340 --> 02:27:00.340
I don't want you to have any friends.

02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:02.340
I want you to sit in a box.

02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:06.340
I guess if you're like really on the

02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:08.340
but then there's like

02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:10.340
there's a power dynamic

02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:12.340
that like you can be quite

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:14.340
influential in a relationship

02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:16.340
in convincing your partner

02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:18.340
and it sure sounds like you're honestly

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.340
agreeing to a thing but you're not really

02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:22.340
agreeing. That's the, I mean

02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:24.340
part of that is the beauty of relationships

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:26.340
right? Like

02:27:26.340 --> 02:27:28.340
it's messy. It can be messy.

02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:30.340
It's hard to know what you really want

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:32.340
right? I think that's mainly my complaint with monogamy.

02:27:32.340 --> 02:27:34.340
Like I'm down with like conscious

02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:36.340
monogamy. Yeah. But I think so

02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:38.340
many relationships are like monogamous by default.

02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:40.340
People, it's not actually

02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:42.340
right for them but they just get into it because culture

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.340
just doesn't give them another option.

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:46.340
And they don't even ask themselves the question is this

02:27:46.340 --> 02:27:48.340
right for me? Which like I'm a weird

02:27:48.340 --> 02:27:50.340
ass person who thinks a lot of weird shit but

02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:52.340
I didn't even think about polyamorous

02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:54.340
an option before I had heard that it existed.

02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:56.340
And I was only when I first met my

02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:58.340
first polyamorous couple and I was like oh

02:27:58.340 --> 02:28:00.340
that's what I am. That's clearly the thing

02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:02.340
that I am. Yeah

02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:04.340
it's funny because to me monogamy

02:28:04.340 --> 02:28:06.340
it's not a

02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:08.340
it doesn't make sense for it to be a default.

02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:10.340
Like to me monogamy goes against

02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:12.340
human nature. That's

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:14.340
in some sense like romance is a

02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:16.340
fuck you to the way the world works.

02:28:16.340 --> 02:28:18.340
Really? Yeah like it's a

02:28:18.340 --> 02:28:20.340
like Romeo and Juliet romance. Like

02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:22.340
traditional

02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:24.340
description of what romance looks like versus like

02:28:24.340 --> 02:28:26.340
sure there's like a million variations

02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:28.340
of that. But in my head

02:28:28.340 --> 02:28:30.340
like this partnership that's

02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:32.340
for a long time together

02:28:32.340 --> 02:28:34.340
is a kind of you know

02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:36.340
like I don't know

02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:38.340
like true romance. You know that movie? It's a really

02:28:38.340 --> 02:28:40.340
fucking good movie. I haven't seen it now. Okay.

02:28:40.340 --> 02:28:42.340
There's just like a

02:28:42.340 --> 02:28:44.340
you're together

02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:46.340
against the world.

02:28:48.340 --> 02:28:50.340
That's the

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.340
I mean that's what close friendship feels like.

02:28:52.340 --> 02:28:54.340
It's like ride or die. Yeah. Like that.

02:28:54.340 --> 02:28:56.340
I guess it doesn't

02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:58.340
it can span across multiple

02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:00.340
you can have multiple partners in that

02:29:00.340 --> 02:29:02.340
way. Yeah absolutely. But I just don't see

02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:04.340
monogamy as like

02:29:04.340 --> 02:29:06.340
definitely not a default.

02:29:06.340 --> 02:29:08.340
I would actually like honestly would

02:29:08.340 --> 02:29:10.340
probably see polyamory as a more

02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.340
natural default.

02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:14.340
I mean I guess it depends on what you mean by default.

02:29:14.340 --> 02:29:16.340
Like most of human history has been

02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:18.340
sort of a weird mix. Like you get polygamy

02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:20.340
and monogamy or the kind of the main

02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:22.340
arrangements. Sure.

02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:24.340
But I mean just like human nature. Yeah. People

02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:26.340
are attracted to other people and they want to

02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:28.340
especially in longer term relationships.

02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:30.340
I tracked in my relationship survey

02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:32.340
I tracked the amount of cheating over time

02:29:32.340 --> 02:29:34.340
in a relationship. Like how long have you been in this relationship

02:29:34.340 --> 02:29:36.340
and have you cheated?

02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:38.340
What's the results of that?

02:29:38.340 --> 02:29:40.340
Men cheat a lot. Women too.

02:29:40.340 --> 02:29:42.340
But men cheat about 30% more than women do.

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.340
I also asked men and women to predict

02:29:44.340 --> 02:29:46.340
if they think their partner has cheated.

02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:48.340
And people's predictions were about the same.

02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:50.340
So people roughly predicted that their

02:29:50.340 --> 02:29:52.340
male or female like spouse

02:29:52.340 --> 02:29:54.340
hadn't cheated

02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:56.340
about the same rate. But men cheated much more than women.

02:29:56.340 --> 02:29:58.340
So who was more correct in their prediction though?

02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:00.340
So men were more correct

02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:02.340
in their prediction predicting women.

02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:04.340
Women were more off.

02:30:04.340 --> 02:30:06.340
Women thought men cheated much less than they actually

02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:08.340
did.

02:30:08.340 --> 02:30:10.340
Both of them were off but like

02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:12.340
the male gap was significantly more.

02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:14.340
So yeah I mean you're right. When you say monogamy

02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:16.340
is not default like I think you're

02:30:16.340 --> 02:30:18.340
like really getting at something. Like human beings

02:30:18.340 --> 02:30:20.340
are just, especially in long term relationships, difficult

02:30:20.340 --> 02:30:22.340
to only

02:30:22.340 --> 02:30:24.340
want one person. But to be fair I think

02:30:24.340 --> 02:30:26.340
monogamy and commitment are very different. I think you'd

02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:28.340
be incredibly, I've known so many very

02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:30.340
long term super committed

02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:32.340
poly couples that live lives that look very similar

02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:34.340
to the very romantic monogamous couples.

02:30:34.340 --> 02:30:36.340
Like children, houses, like 20

02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:38.340
years. And that

02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:40.340
works great for them.

02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:42.340
Yeah. Yeah.

02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:44.340
I mean

02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:46.340
there's so much to like open

02:30:46.340 --> 02:30:48.340
your mind to in these

02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:50.340
kinds of conversations, these kinds of ideas.

02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:52.340
But I also like realize like

02:30:52.340 --> 02:30:54.340
some of the cake is baked. Like I have

02:30:54.340 --> 02:30:56.340
some assumptions that are hard to break through.

02:30:56.340 --> 02:30:58.340
Like what? For myself.

02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:00.340
Like it's difficult for me to

02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:02.340
imagine a polyamorous relationship for me

02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:04.340
that would work.

02:31:04.340 --> 02:31:06.340
But I don't have enough data. I don't have

02:31:06.340 --> 02:31:08.340
like I have very little.

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:10.340
But like at this point

02:31:10.340 --> 02:31:12.340
it's like

02:31:12.340 --> 02:31:14.340
I haven't

02:31:14.340 --> 02:31:16.340
eaten pizza in like 20 years.

02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:18.340
Because I know I just don't

02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:20.340
disappoint yourself. I just

02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:22.340
eat low carb because

02:31:22.340 --> 02:31:24.340
it makes me feel good. But there's

02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:26.340
so many foods I haven't explored.

02:31:26.340 --> 02:31:28.340
It's just like

02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:30.340
I know what I love.

02:31:30.340 --> 02:31:32.340
You explore every once in a while?

02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.340
Yeah. And you kind of figure that out.

02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:36.340
But at the same time you're humbled

02:31:36.340 --> 02:31:38.340
by like even talking to you or looking at your

02:31:38.340 --> 02:31:40.340
data. Like sexuality is

02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:42.340
a fascinating topic because

02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:44.340
it seems that we're

02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:46.340
very, like we're talking about, very afraid

02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:48.340
of this topic. Like to be

02:31:48.340 --> 02:31:50.340
really honest with ourselves about it.

02:31:50.340 --> 02:31:52.340
The whole like academic

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:54.340
research is afraid of it.

02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:56.340
But it's so core to who we are as human beings.

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.340
I gotta ask you about this.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.340
I can't believe it took this long to get there.

02:32:00.340 --> 02:32:02.340
But one of your many fascinating

02:32:02.340 --> 02:32:04.340
surveys is on fetishes.

02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:08.340
You wrote a blog post about it.

02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:10.340
Probably several

02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:12.340
because it's like a huge data set.

02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:14.340
Still in progress, yeah.

02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:16.340
So the one I'm referring to is on popularity

02:32:16.340 --> 02:32:18.340
and taboo-ness of various

02:32:18.340 --> 02:32:20.340
fetishes.

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:22.340
So what are some interesting takeaways? I gotta pull up

02:32:22.340 --> 02:32:24.340
this graph because it's freaking epic.

02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:26.340
Yes, this is a big graph and it has

02:32:26.340 --> 02:32:28.340
taboo-ness as one axis and

02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:30.340
popularity

02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:32.340
as the other.

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:34.340
For people who are just listening on the X axis

02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:36.340
as taboo-ness.

02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:38.340
Asked to rate

02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:40.340
how taboo society viewed

02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:42.340
the sexual interest. And on the Y axis

02:32:42.340 --> 02:32:44.340
as percent of people reporting

02:32:44.340 --> 02:32:46.340
interest. Log scale.

02:32:46.340 --> 02:32:48.340
Oh boy.

02:32:48.340 --> 02:32:50.340
Alright, so

02:32:50.340 --> 02:32:52.340
just some examples on the

02:32:52.340 --> 02:32:54.340
low taboo-ness and high popularity.

02:32:54.340 --> 02:32:56.340
There's a correlation here. I think you said

02:32:56.340 --> 02:32:58.340
it's .69.

02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:00.340
It's just hilarious.

02:33:00.340 --> 02:33:02.340
Is it still .69? Are you tracking that?

02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:04.340
I haven't looked since I did this.

02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:06.340
So like the last

02:33:06.340 --> 02:33:08.340
taboo stuff is more likely to be popular

02:33:08.340 --> 02:33:10.340
and the more taboo stuff is less likely to be popular.

02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:12.340
And on the

02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:14.340
like missionary position

02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:16.340
fingering

02:33:16.340 --> 02:33:18.340
vagina, blowjobs,

02:33:18.340 --> 02:33:20.340
light spanking, cuddling.

02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:22.340
Cuddling is more taboo than

02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:24.340
missionary? I think people

02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:26.340
are conceiving like if you're like I'm really sexually

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:28.340
aroused by cuddling specifically. Sure.

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:30.340
Then you're like that's a little more weird than getting specifically aroused by blowjobs.

02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:32.340
You expect people to be aroused by blowjobs.

02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:34.340
So this was like getting at like

02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:36.340
as a fetish versus like an activity.

02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:38.340
Yes, as specific as like a concrete

02:33:38.340 --> 02:33:40.340
sexual interest. Like I am specifically interested in this

02:33:40.340 --> 02:33:42.340
thing. Yeah. And so those are

02:33:42.340 --> 02:33:44.340
thighs and lips. Different body parts.

02:33:44.340 --> 02:33:46.340
Jaw lines.

02:33:46.340 --> 02:33:48.340
And then some of it is color based on

02:33:48.340 --> 02:33:50.340
more female preference

02:33:50.340 --> 02:33:52.340
versus male preference.

02:33:52.340 --> 02:33:54.340
Like jaw lines is more

02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:56.340
female preference.

02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:58.340
Being submissive is

02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:00.340
more female preference. Light bondage.

02:34:00.340 --> 02:34:02.340
More

02:34:02.340 --> 02:34:04.340
female.

02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:06.340
There's a lot of interesting ones. There's so much. Okay.

02:34:06.340 --> 02:34:08.340
But then on the far side of that

02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:10.340
I mean it gets pretty dark.

02:34:10.340 --> 02:34:12.340
But even all along the way

02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:14.340
like extreme bondage

02:34:14.340 --> 02:34:16.340
being at 50 tabunas.

02:34:16.340 --> 02:34:18.340
Pegging.

02:34:18.340 --> 02:34:20.340
Pain. Giving pain.

02:34:20.340 --> 02:34:22.340
Sexual frustration.

02:34:22.340 --> 02:34:24.340
I suppose as a

02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:26.340
kink. Yeah.

02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:28.340
And there's so many interesting ones like to me

02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.340
just that I haven't even

02:34:30.340 --> 02:34:32.340
considered. Yeah.

02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:34.340
I had to do so much research into fetishes

02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:36.340
to compile the list.

02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:38.340
Are there some surprising like options

02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:40.340
to you that you're like oh okay. This is like

02:34:40.340 --> 02:34:42.340
a fetish. Yeah. Well more confusing

02:34:42.340 --> 02:34:44.340
was like what the fetishes are about.

02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.340
Because like I didn't want to overlap fetishes

02:34:46.340 --> 02:34:48.340
so I had to kind of look into them. Yeah.

02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:50.340
And I'm like there's like such

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:52.340
interesting manifestations of core drives.

02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:54.340
Like if you're really aroused by disgust like

02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:56.340
maybe you're very into rolling around in dirt but

02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:58.340
you're not into rolling around with ice cream.

02:34:58.340 --> 02:35:00.340
So I'm like okay I have to make those into two separate fetishes

02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:02.340
you know. Sure. And like I'm

02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:04.340
seeing like at the far end

02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:08.340
rodents.

02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:10.340
Like

02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:12.340
different types of incest.

02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:14.340
Branding.

02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:16.340
So there's like pain. Yeah.

02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:18.340
Like wound fucking.

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.340
Sex with animals

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.340
I guess. Dogs, horses.

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:28.340
Receiving oral

02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:30.340
sex from an animal

02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.340
is high taboo-ness and pretty

02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:34.340
high popularity. Yeah. Surprisingly high popularity.

02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:36.340
I was really shocked by that one.

02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:38.340
I went and triple checked that number because I'm like no way

02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:40.340
this amount of people are reporting

02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.340
interest. Do you know which animal?

02:35:42.340 --> 02:35:44.340
Is there? No.

02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:46.340
I didn't specify. I asked like which animals

02:35:46.340 --> 02:35:48.340
are erotic and then I separately asked like how

02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:50.340
erotic is it to receive oral

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:52.340
sex from your preferred animal.

02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:54.340
This is so fascinating.

02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:56.340
So I would

02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:58.340
like can we just talk about the

02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:00.340
methodology of this?

02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:04.340
This

02:36:04.340 --> 02:36:06.340
feels like deeply honest

02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:08.340
map of

02:36:08.340 --> 02:36:10.340
humanity in a way we don't

02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:12.340
usually map humanity. Yeah.

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:14.340
Like cause it's so

02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:16.340
like your fetishes

02:36:16.340 --> 02:36:18.340
are so meaningful to each

02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:20.340
individual person. Yeah. That's what I

02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:22.340
love about this work. It's like

02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:24.340
nobody cares about someone's fetishes.

02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:26.340
You never get to express them and if you have

02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:28.340
a more unusual fetish people usually judge you.

02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:30.340
So it's like this tiny little pocket of like

02:36:30.340 --> 02:36:32.340
this shame thing but it's so

02:36:32.340 --> 02:36:34.340
cool to me that like human

02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:36.340
brains can be oriented in such a way like wound

02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.340
fucking. Like somebody finds

02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:40.340
that so erotic and that's so cool.

02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:42.340
Yeah. And then

02:36:42.340 --> 02:36:44.340
they probably and it should

02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:46.340
be explored like how did that come to be?

02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:48.340
You mentioned that we like to construct

02:36:48.340 --> 02:36:50.340
narratives that somehow was grounded in

02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:52.340
childhood but maybe it's genetic. Maybe

02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:54.340
it has to do with maybe you can actually

02:36:54.340 --> 02:36:56.340
form and unform that fetish

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:58.340
very quickly. I don't know.

02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:00.340
This is one of the things that I'm researching.

02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:02.340
So in the big survey that I'm doing

02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:04.340
I asked so many questions about childhood. All

02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:06.340
the ones that I think like we have common theories

02:37:06.340 --> 02:37:08.340
about like oh are you abused?

02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:10.340
Is it yelled at by a man or a woman?

02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:12.340
Stuff like that. Like are you really sexually

02:37:12.340 --> 02:37:14.340
repressive? You know is it gender roles where you

02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:16.340
expected to conform?

02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:18.340
A whole bunch of stuff. And then I asked you know obviously

02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:20.340
about like a massive amount of fetishes.

02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:22.340
And my sample size right now is 500,000 people.

02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:24.340
500,000 people. Yeah it's massive.

02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:26.340
And I have it stated for all of it.

02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:28.340
And the result looks like it's

02:37:28.340 --> 02:37:30.340
not really correlated. Nothing that I asked

02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.340
about in childhood. Nothing

02:37:32.340 --> 02:37:34.340
correlates with fetish preference later in life.

02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:36.340
It does correlate with onset.

02:37:36.340 --> 02:37:38.340
Lots of things that happen in childhood can

02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:40.340
like change like the age at which

02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:42.340
it triggers. They have so many fascinating

02:37:42.340 --> 02:37:44.340
blog posts. You had a blog post I think on

02:37:44.340 --> 02:37:46.340
the age of fetish

02:37:46.340 --> 02:37:48.340
onset. Yeah.

02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:50.340
And

02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:52.340
like you

02:37:52.340 --> 02:37:54.340
organized it by age.

02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:56.340
Like reproduction

02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:58.340
as a fetish. I guess pregnancy.

02:37:58.340 --> 02:38:00.340
At the age of 17.

02:38:00.340 --> 02:38:02.340
About 16.9.

02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:04.340
Toys and like anal

02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:06.340
beads is 15.5.

02:38:06.340 --> 02:38:08.340
Yeah one of the interesting things

02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:10.340
I found. I mean this data set is

02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:12.340
so huge it's taking me a long time to go through it. So this is

02:38:12.340 --> 02:38:14.340
like snippets from what I remember when I was glancing

02:38:14.340 --> 02:38:16.340
through the data. So this part is not rigorous.

02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:18.340
But I seem to get the impression that

02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:20.340
if you are

02:38:20.340 --> 02:38:22.340
a fetish occurs for you earlier. Like if you're much earlier

02:38:22.340 --> 02:38:24.340
onset you're more likely to report being extremely

02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:26.340
interested into it. So later

02:38:26.340 --> 02:38:28.340
onset means you're going to be like less into the fetish.

02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:30.340
But if it hits earlier.

02:38:30.340 --> 02:38:32.340
I wonder if it passes like

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:34.340
Yeah I didn't measure

02:38:34.340 --> 02:38:36.340
old fetishes at all.

02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:38.340
Like no longer. Right.

02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.340
You used to but it is no longer

02:38:40.340 --> 02:38:42.340
there. Interesting. One interesting thing that

02:38:42.340 --> 02:38:44.340
I don't understand is that

02:38:44.340 --> 02:38:46.340
that non-cis people seem to have

02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:48.340
more correlation between childhood experiences

02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:50.340
and fetishes. So I was saying that there's no correlation

02:38:50.340 --> 02:38:52.340
between childhood experiences and fetishes.

02:38:52.340 --> 02:38:54.340
This holds for cis people. But trans people

02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:56.340
especially trans men there's a correlation.

02:38:56.340 --> 02:38:58.340
It doesn't mean they have absolutely higher rates

02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:00.340
of abuse or fetishes or anything.

02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:02.340
But I'm just saying that like for them

02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:04.340
there does actually seem to be some sort of connection

02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:06.340
between childhood experiences and sexuality later in life.

02:39:06.340 --> 02:39:08.340
And I don't understand why this plays to one

02:39:08.340 --> 02:39:10.340
group and not the other. I don't have a good theory for that.

02:39:10.340 --> 02:39:12.340
So usually you try like when you see something like

02:39:12.340 --> 02:39:14.340
that you'll try to construct a theory and see

02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:16.340
if you can find like

02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:18.340
you keep that theory in mind

02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:20.340
like a hypothesis of why it would be

02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:22.340
and then you ask further questions

02:39:22.340 --> 02:39:24.340
to try to elaborate.

02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:26.340
So can you maybe talk about the methodology

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:28.340
of how you got the 500,000? Like what

02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:32.340
like how did this come to be?

02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:34.340
I might go into way too much detail

02:39:34.340 --> 02:39:36.340
about this because I thought about this so much.

02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:38.340
Because the question is how do you get

02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:40.340
a lot of people to take a big survey?

02:39:40.340 --> 02:39:42.340
The longer the survey is the lower the response rate.

02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:44.340
And I really wanted to do one big

02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:46.340
comprehensive survey so I could like check a whole

02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:48.340
bunch of correlations within it.

02:39:48.340 --> 02:39:50.340
Because it's you know more annoying

02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:52.340
and it's harder to get a lot of people to

02:39:52.340 --> 02:39:54.340
retake similar surveys to each other at a time.

02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:56.340
So I'm like okay I need to convince a very

02:39:56.340 --> 02:39:58.340
large number of people to take a lot of these questions.

02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:00.340
And even building the questions that was

02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:02.340
really hard because I'm like okay I need a comprehensive

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:04.340
amount of fetishes. I can't

02:40:04.340 --> 02:40:06.340
ask everybody to answer for every

02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:08.340
single niche fetish. I'm like do you like

02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:10.340
ball gags? Do you like funnel gags? Do you like

02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.340
wife shrew gags?

02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:14.340
Whatever. I'm like you can't do that.

02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.340
Nobody's going to finish that survey.

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:18.340
I'm not going to ask questions.

02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:20.340
What's a wife shrew but okay.

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:22.340
I'm trying to refer to

02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:24.340
like there's like a thing that like

02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:26.340
different types of gags.

02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:28.340
So I'm like

02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:30.340
so what I need to do is I need to ask people a

02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:32.340
question like are you in like bondage? And if you say

02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:34.340
yes then then I'll go ask you all the bondage questions.

02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:36.340
But then this

02:40:36.340 --> 02:40:38.340
seems simple but then it just exploded

02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:40.340
because I'm like how do I categorize these

02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:42.340
fetishes? There's like if you're into

02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:44.340
splashing which is

02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:46.340
like you like sitting

02:40:46.340 --> 02:40:48.340
in cakes you like getting in mud but basically

02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:50.340
like kind of messy sensory.

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:52.340
Like is this a disgust thing? Is it a

02:40:52.340 --> 02:40:54.340
humiliation thing? Is it a sensory thing?

02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:56.340
Like which category

02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:58.340
anyway. So it took me like two

02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:00.340
months of just agonizing over each

02:41:00.340 --> 02:41:02.340
fetish because you don't want to miss a fetish. You don't

02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:04.340
want to like have a really important thing that you accidentally

02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:06.340
put in disgust category when it actually belongs

02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:08.340
in the humiliation category. You know?

02:41:08.340 --> 02:41:10.340
Well let me think about that because like

02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:12.340
you're still catching it. You're just

02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:14.340
miscategorizing it.

02:41:14.340 --> 02:41:16.340
Right because if you're into splashing and you're like this is clearly a humiliation

02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:18.340
thing. So you say yes I'm into humiliation

02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:20.340
stuff and then I don't ask you about splashing

02:41:20.340 --> 02:41:22.340
then I'm missing a whole dataset of people

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:24.340
because I've falsely categorized it.

02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:26.340
You're going to miss stuff. You're just picking

02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:28.340
what's less and less important to miss.

02:41:28.340 --> 02:41:30.340
Well I'm trying to get people

02:41:30.340 --> 02:41:32.340
into the right question set. Sure.

02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:34.340
Because like I can't ask you all the questions. I have to

02:41:34.340 --> 02:41:36.340
ask you a couple overarching questions to know

02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:38.340
what specific questions to ask you.

02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:40.340
And so I have to those overarching questions have to

02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:42.340
be really really well calibrated

02:41:42.340 --> 02:41:44.340
so that I can accurately feed you into the right

02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:46.340
sub part of the survey. Awesome.

02:41:46.340 --> 02:41:48.340
So that was extremely difficult

02:41:48.340 --> 02:41:50.340
when I'm dealing with I think it was like 850

02:41:50.340 --> 02:41:52.340
fetishes.

02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:54.340
So I did a couple things to spot check. I like

02:41:54.340 --> 02:41:56.340
I did a couple questions where I asked

02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:58.340
like in the detailed in the survey but

02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:00.340
like also the beginning of the survey just to see like

02:42:00.340 --> 02:42:02.340
what percentage of people I was capturing.

02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:04.340
But and then and then I scored the

02:42:04.340 --> 02:42:06.340
survey. So if you take it I

02:42:06.340 --> 02:42:08.340
had other people answer preliminary

02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:10.340
surveys where they gave me data about how

02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:12.340
taboo the various fetishes were.

02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:14.340
And then I used that data so that when you fill

02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:16.340
out the survey it's extremely comprehensive

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:18.340
and you get data about exactly how taboo your

02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:20.340
interests are. And then you get a score at the end

02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:22.340
and I give you an equivalent

02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:24.340
kinky character. Which I also had people

02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:26.340
write a whole bunch of fictional characters and some

02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:28.340
historic ones about like how kinky they were.

02:42:28.340 --> 02:42:30.340
So then I matched the historic

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:32.340
historic character kinky character to

02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:34.340
your score. So that makes it like

02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:36.340
more fun like gamifies it a little bit.

02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.340
And you can like you can brag about

02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:40.340
like how people would share it with others.

02:42:40.340 --> 02:42:42.340
And a lot of the characters were like goofy like

02:42:42.340 --> 02:42:44.340
like there's Spongebob and like

02:42:44.340 --> 02:42:46.340
Hitler's on there and

02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:48.340
you know South Park characters.

02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:50.340
What kink does Hitler have?

02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:52.340
I think he's like he's around Marilyn

02:42:52.340 --> 02:42:54.340
Monroe. Which is

02:42:54.340 --> 02:42:56.340
like slightly above average.

02:42:56.340 --> 02:42:58.340
Oh sorry.

02:42:58.340 --> 02:43:00.340
I thought there was like a two-dimensional

02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:02.340
space somehow. So this is like

02:43:02.340 --> 02:43:04.340
literally from zero. How kinky, yeah.

02:43:04.340 --> 02:43:06.340
So Hitler is about as a Marilyn

02:43:06.340 --> 02:43:08.340
Monroe. Who is the most, what's the

02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:10.340
character for like? Willy Wonka. Is the most

02:43:10.340 --> 02:43:12.340
kinky. Is the most kinky, yeah.

02:43:12.340 --> 02:43:14.340
I think like maybe Captain America

02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:16.340
was the least kinky or something. Or

02:43:16.340 --> 02:43:18.340
Gandhi.

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:20.340
Meanwhile, but that's

02:43:20.340 --> 02:43:22.340
another conversation.

02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:24.340
Oh boy.

02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:26.340
So even viral on TikTok basically

02:43:26.340 --> 02:43:28.340
because people were like what? I got this insane

02:43:28.340 --> 02:43:30.340
character and then

02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:32.340
the sample size exploded from

02:43:32.340 --> 02:43:34.340
40,000 to 500,000.

02:43:34.340 --> 02:43:36.340
Wow. So like all it took

02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:38.340
is that kind of incentive? Or did you like

02:43:38.340 --> 02:43:40.340
at first have to pay people for this

02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:42.340
ever? No, it was just that incentive.

02:43:44.340 --> 02:43:46.340
And what about the demographic? Are the

02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:48.340
different people that took it? Mostly younger.

02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:50.340
So usually early 20s.

02:43:50.340 --> 02:43:52.340
Predominantly female. Like 70%

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:54.340
female. 70% female?

02:43:54.340 --> 02:43:56.340
Maybe like perhaps on a TikTok

02:43:56.340 --> 02:43:58.340
demographics pretty well. Oh, okay.

02:43:58.340 --> 02:44:00.340
I got it. That's interesting.

02:44:00.340 --> 02:44:02.340
Young people are probably better

02:44:02.340 --> 02:44:04.340
for this kind of survey.

02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:06.340
Because there's probably a culture that's

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:08.340
a little bit more honest about their sexuality.

02:44:08.340 --> 02:44:10.340
Yeah, most likely. I think people are

02:44:10.340 --> 02:44:12.340
incentivized to be honest when they're getting a

02:44:12.340 --> 02:44:14.340
true identity response out of it.

02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:16.340
Like if you're doing it

02:44:16.340 --> 02:44:18.340
for money, you don't care. But like if you

02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:20.340
are invested in the result, you want to know

02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:22.340
what the truth of the answers

02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:24.340
then you actually... There's possibly you

02:44:24.340 --> 02:44:26.340
also don't want to know the truth.

02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:28.340
Yeah, this is true. But on average, hopefully

02:44:28.340 --> 02:44:30.340
that doesn't. I mean, these are really difficult.

02:44:30.340 --> 02:44:32.340
Is there some interesting little

02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:34.340
quirks that

02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:36.340
people should know about your

02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:38.340
methodology that you had to kind of

02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:40.340
solve to try to get to

02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:42.340
a really good survey? So one of you said is the

02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:44.340
categorization to make it more efficient.

02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:46.340
Is there some for the analysis

02:44:46.340 --> 02:44:48.340
part? Yeah, so the graph that

02:44:48.340 --> 02:44:50.340
you were talking about is

02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:52.340
binary. So it's like if

02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:54.340
somebody expressed even a little bit of interest,

02:44:54.340 --> 02:44:56.340
then it goes into the graph. So it's like

02:44:56.340 --> 02:44:58.340
80% of people expressed even a little bit of interest.

02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:00.340
So it's not representing degree of interest.

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:02.340
It's not differentiating between them at all.

02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.340
So it's possible that some fetishes have exactly

02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:06.340
the same amount of people that are at least

02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:08.340
a little bit into them. But one of them is very extreme

02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:10.340
interest and the other is

02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:12.340
vague and not very intense.

02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:14.340
So that's not reflected.

02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:16.340
I also probably didn't represent the

02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:18.340
visual part right.

02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:20.340
It might not be intuitive.

02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:22.340
So you chose a log scale.

02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:24.340
But it kind of spreads things out to make

02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:26.340
it more clear.

02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:28.340
Because the linear was just so clustered at the bottom

02:45:28.340 --> 02:45:30.340
you couldn't really separate it out.

02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:32.340
So there's obviously selection effects. It's possible

02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:34.340
that the identity results at the

02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:36.340
end impacted people's results a little

02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:38.340
bit. But the thing is I'm comparing

02:45:38.340 --> 02:45:40.340
it to what exists.

02:45:40.340 --> 02:45:42.340
What is the alternative? And right now

02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:44.340
the research on this stuff is terrible.

02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:46.340
So it's like I'm not saying my research is perfect.

02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:48.340
But at least it's something.

02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:50.340
It's something that's pointing us maybe in a direction

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.340
that we might be able to do more research on.

02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:54.340
And you're making the data available.

02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:56.340
Yeah. I'm doing it

02:45:56.340 --> 02:45:58.340
slowly because

02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:00.340
I ask about so many questions it's

02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:02.340
not very anonymized. So I'm releasing small

02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:04.340
sections of the data at a time.

02:46:06.340 --> 02:46:08.340
Have you published in

02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:10.340
journals and stuff? No I haven't.

02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:12.340
Do you have any interest in that? Or is your

02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:14.340
approach? I'm conflicted about

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:16.340
it. It sounds cool because then I could be

02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:18.340
like haha I'm published in a journal.

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.340
And then people who are yelling about me who don't

02:46:20.340 --> 02:46:22.340
know anything about statistics on Twitter then I can go

02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:24.340
shove it in their face. But then you're also giving

02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:26.340
into the silly criticism right?

02:46:26.340 --> 02:46:28.340
I feel

02:46:28.340 --> 02:46:30.340
so passionate about

02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:32.340
extra science. Science

02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:34.340
that you can just do. I want to make

02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:36.340
science accessible. Anybody can

02:46:36.340 --> 02:46:38.340
just go look and learn about the basics

02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:40.340
of doing a survey or

02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:42.340
figuring out how to interpret information.

02:46:42.340 --> 02:46:44.340
And doing

02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:46.340
a published journal feels like I'm

02:46:46.340 --> 02:46:48.340
betraying my cause a little bit.

02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:50.340
That's often behind a paywall.

02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:52.340
Yeah. It goes against

02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:54.340
the...I mean I think

02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:56.340
you not publishing a journal is doing

02:46:56.340 --> 02:46:58.340
a big public service.

02:46:58.340 --> 02:47:00.340
I think it's the first time I've heard that.

02:47:00.340 --> 02:47:02.340
Thank you. Well it's just coming from

02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:04.340
like on this topic

02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:06.340
the elitism

02:47:06.340 --> 02:47:08.340
I see on the psychology

02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:10.340
side with the journals and the academia

02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:12.340
the positions and the institutions

02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:14.340
you come from all of that. That goes

02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:16.340
against

02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:18.340
I think that's more useful for

02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:20.340
math and computer science and so on.

02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:22.340
Where there's like

02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:24.340
clear like

02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:26.340
but even then

02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:28.340
code is code. Data

02:47:28.340 --> 02:47:30.340
is data. Like

02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:32.340
prestige shouldn't matter at all.

02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:34.340
Maybe

02:47:34.340 --> 02:47:36.340
for like

02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:38.340
biological experiments like virology

02:47:38.340 --> 02:47:40.340
or something like that.

02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:42.340
It's good to be from a major lab

02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:44.340
that has a reputation for like

02:47:44.340 --> 02:47:46.340
going through all the procedures

02:47:46.340 --> 02:47:48.340
like you know you can trust.

02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:50.340
But here like you're dealing with a giant mess

02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:52.340
of humanity.

02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:54.340
It's beautiful to be transparent, to be raw

02:47:54.340 --> 02:47:56.340
to be exploring it together with everybody.

02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:58.340
It's really beautiful. I think people like have

02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:00.340
a lot of incentive to doubt the results.

02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:02.340
A lot of the research I'm doing is to like

02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:04.340
cis and trans people. Like we don't

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:06.340
have any data about transsexuality.

02:48:06.340 --> 02:48:08.340
Like not very good at least.

02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:10.340
And I'm really curious. I don't really have an agenda

02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:12.340
about it. I think like being trans

02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:14.340
is cool. If you want to be trans do it.

02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:16.340
And like I have some skepticism about like

02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:18.340
gender theory. But like it doesn't

02:48:18.340 --> 02:48:20.340
come down to impact like the way I think trans people

02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:22.340
should be treated. Which I think is like

02:48:22.340 --> 02:48:24.340
be fucking nice and human about it.

02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:26.340
I don't know. But when I'm talking about

02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:28.340
the thing like my conclusions are

02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:30.340
that like transsexuality is really unique.

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:32.340
It's not like

02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:34.340
like cis or cis woman

02:48:34.340 --> 02:48:36.340
or man sexuality at all. And to me this is

02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:38.340
super cool. But like a lot of people, this is very

02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:40.340
politicized right now. Like

02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:42.340
the data into like transsexual

02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:44.340
preferences, like it's so loaded. Which is

02:48:44.340 --> 02:48:46.340
really sad because I am very accepting

02:48:46.340 --> 02:48:48.340
of weird sexuality. Like if you're into

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:50.340
a weird thing, I'm like good for you. This is super

02:48:50.340 --> 02:48:52.340
cool. Like let's figure out how to make it

02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:54.340
so that you can explore the thing you're into

02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:56.340
without any stigma. But because

02:48:56.340 --> 02:48:58.340
there's so much stigma that like if you find that one

02:48:58.340 --> 02:49:00.340
demographic is in a weirder sex stuff than the other

02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:02.340
like it's hard to present that in a way that

02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:04.340
people don't weaponize. So it's been

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:06.340
really politically touchy subject here.

02:49:06.340 --> 02:49:08.340
Yeah, but you do it in a way that's not

02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:10.340
feel like it has an agenda.

02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:12.340
Right? You're just exploring.

02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:14.340
Yeah. I feel pretty open

02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:16.340
to what I'm going to find. Like I

02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:18.340
often have no idea what the data is going to tell

02:49:18.340 --> 02:49:20.340
me. And I'm like I pre-commit like I could say

02:49:20.340 --> 02:49:22.340
A, B, or C. And I'm like down to publish any

02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:24.340
of those findings.

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:26.340
So you've put together

02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:28.340
an ask whole

02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:30.340
cart deck with a lot of awesome

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:32.340
questions to ask at a party.

02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:34.340
Or anywhere, honestly.

02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:36.340
Including on the podcast.

02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:38.340
Let me ask you one from that

02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:40.340
deck. Is sex really about

02:49:40.340 --> 02:49:42.340
power? So what's the role of power dynamics

02:49:42.340 --> 02:49:44.340
in sex?

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:46.340
Everything you understand like from the survey

02:49:46.340 --> 02:49:48.340
in terms of what people are turned on

02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:50.340
by. You've talked about like

02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:52.340
the preferences that women versus

02:49:52.340 --> 02:49:54.340
men have for like submissiveness

02:49:54.340 --> 02:49:56.340
and dominance.

02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:58.340
And we've already talked

02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:00.340
about it a little bit. But like it's expressed

02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:02.340
more strongly. I already

02:50:02.340 --> 02:50:04.340
forget the results. But I feel like women have

02:50:04.340 --> 02:50:06.340
more preference to be submissive. Yeah. This is one

02:50:06.340 --> 02:50:08.340
of the things that got me into researching

02:50:08.340 --> 02:50:10.340
fetishes to begin with. Because I

02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:12.340
think I came across some data. I did like a brief

02:50:12.340 --> 02:50:14.340
survey where roughly

02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:16.340
around 60% of women report being submissive

02:50:16.340 --> 02:50:18.340
and 40% of men report being

02:50:18.340 --> 02:50:20.340
dominant. And this was really fascinating to me.

02:50:20.340 --> 02:50:22.340
Like why is there this gap? Like

02:50:22.340 --> 02:50:24.340
why do we not? Because I

02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:26.340
guess I have some priors that maybe this is an evolutionary

02:50:26.340 --> 02:50:28.340
thing. Like the submission dominant like strong

02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:30.340
men and you know like women being like

02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:32.340
ah that's hot hot man. You know the men are

02:50:32.340 --> 02:50:34.340
like ravaging and stuff. Like shouldn't this be

02:50:34.340 --> 02:50:36.340
in our genes? But

02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:38.340
there's a gap.

02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:40.340
What's the gap? The gap is the dominant

02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:42.340
submissive gap. More women are submissive than there are

02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:44.340
dominant men. Oh.

02:50:44.340 --> 02:50:46.340
Really? Yeah. It's

02:50:46.340 --> 02:50:48.340
a pretty significant gap. And this is held

02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:50.340
up like it depends on what you're testing. I've tested a

02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:52.340
bunch of things. This is part of why I did this big

02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:54.340
survey. Nice. But it

02:50:54.340 --> 02:50:56.340
depends again on like what kind

02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:58.340
of dominance you're measuring. But overall

02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:00.340
it's roughly 40 to 60%.

02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:02.340
So when you say there's not many dominant men

02:51:02.340 --> 02:51:04.340
then the meaning

02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:06.340
like they express like a desire to be

02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:08.340
dominant in the relationship? Yeah.

02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:10.340
Or like sexually. Sexually.

02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:12.340
In bed. So like if I ask questions

02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:14.340
like how much do you like being dominant in bed?

02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:16.340
Like men are less likely to answer strong

02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:18.340
yes to that question. But if I ask

02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:20.340
are you likely to be submissive?

02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:22.340
Like women are very much yes.

02:51:22.340 --> 02:51:24.340
Really? And that's expressive?

02:51:24.340 --> 02:51:26.340
Like that's that

02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:28.340
represents truth?

02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:30.340
My guess. What's wrong with men? So this

02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.340
is I think there's some reflection like

02:51:32.340 --> 02:51:34.340
FetLife. So FetLife is this website where people like sign

02:51:34.340 --> 02:51:36.340
up and connect based on their fetishes.

02:51:36.340 --> 02:51:38.340
And this is like you can kind of see

02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:40.340
it picked up in the forum posts about like

02:51:40.340 --> 02:51:42.340
how like dominant men are you know are getting laid

02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:44.340
so much and you know submissives are always

02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:46.340
looking for a dominant. Like there's it's an

02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:48.340
unequal market. Holy shit.

02:51:48.340 --> 02:51:50.340
This is great news.

02:51:50.340 --> 02:51:52.340
I didn't know this. That's interesting.

02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:54.340
Yeah. Interesting. What does it reflect

02:51:54.340 --> 02:51:56.340
about modern society? Is that like

02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:58.340
because you know there's these trends about like

02:51:58.340 --> 02:52:00.340
decreased masculinity or that kind of thing.

02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:02.340
Is that similar?

02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:04.340
I'm trying not to hold on to one theory

02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:06.340
because I'm not sure. One is possible like decreasing

02:52:06.340 --> 02:52:08.340
testosterone levels.

02:52:08.340 --> 02:52:10.340
Testosterone seems to be I have a little bit

02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:12.340
of other research but I'm still checking it out

02:52:12.340 --> 02:52:14.340
that seems to indicate that higher testosterone

02:52:14.340 --> 02:52:16.340
you're more likely to be dominant. So if we're

02:52:16.340 --> 02:52:18.340
seeing decreased testosterone levels across society

02:52:18.340 --> 02:52:20.340
we should be seeing a greater

02:52:20.340 --> 02:52:22.340
gap.

02:52:22.340 --> 02:52:24.340
This is so fascinating. Once again this is

02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:26.340
like a super interesting way to look at humanity

02:52:26.340 --> 02:52:28.340
because it is such an important

02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:30.340
part of humanity. And so like how many

02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:32.340
people are doing large scale

02:52:32.340 --> 02:52:34.340
research like this? I feel like you're like

02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:36.340
at the top of the world. You're like world class

02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:38.340
at the top of the world doing research on this

02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.340
stuff. Yeah I think I might have the biggest

02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:42.340
most comprehensive fetish

02:52:42.340 --> 02:52:44.340
data set in the world right now.

02:52:44.340 --> 02:52:46.340
That's epic.

02:52:46.340 --> 02:52:48.340
Thank you. I'm really happy

02:52:48.340 --> 02:52:50.340
about it. I'm very proud.

02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:52.340
And it's

02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:54.340
probably growing but it's also enabling you

02:52:54.340 --> 02:52:56.340
to establish a name.

02:52:56.340 --> 02:52:58.340
Like a reputation

02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:00.340
to where people can go to you to like

02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:02.340
trust you more and more. To do longer surveys

02:53:02.340 --> 02:53:04.340
perhaps.

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.340
I think the

02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:08.340
data analysis afterwards is very different

02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:10.340
from the survey design itself.

02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:12.340
I'm still very amateur at

02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:14.340
the data analysis.

02:53:14.340 --> 02:53:16.340
Yeah but you can always catch up on that. I guess

02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:18.340
the data analysis does enable you to

02:53:18.340 --> 02:53:20.340
does teach you how to ask better questions

02:53:20.340 --> 02:53:22.340
in order to understand. Yes it goes back and forth.

02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:24.340
Like as I'm looking at the data it informs

02:53:24.340 --> 02:53:26.340
the way I want to phrase questions the next time.

02:53:26.340 --> 02:53:28.340
So women are more at least

02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:30.340
in private able to

02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:32.340
say that they would like to be submissive

02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:34.340
and men even in private are not

02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:38.340
disproportionately saying they're not

02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:40.340
willing to be dominant.

02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:42.340
Yeah so it's possible

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:44.340
if this is caused by decreasing testosterone levels

02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:46.340
this means that we're probably having less satisfying

02:53:46.340 --> 02:53:48.340
sex overall. Like we're becoming less and less sexually

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:50.340
compatible as time goes on.

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:52.340
To be fair I'm not sure that it is connected to

02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:54.340
testosterone levels. Like it's possible that this is just like

02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:56.340
a genetic thing. Like

02:53:56.340 --> 02:53:58.340
the gay uncle theory. Like the ideas

02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:00.340
like maybe gay people evolved to like be sort of

02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:02.340
taking themselves out of the gene pool to be

02:54:02.340 --> 02:54:04.340
to be assistants. And like it's possible

02:54:04.340 --> 02:54:06.340
that like there's certain percentage of men sort of

02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.340
like quote unquote evolved to be submissive

02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:10.340
to take themselves out of sexual competition

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:12.340
and to instead be like the

02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:14.340
the monkeys revolving at the

02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:16.340
edge of the pack. It's unclear.

02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:18.340
Oh it's a method of survival? Like

02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:20.340
so you stay out of the competition? Yeah

02:54:20.340 --> 02:54:22.340
and I'm like a little suss about these

02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:24.340
kinds of evo psych theories. So

02:54:24.340 --> 02:54:26.340
I'm not I'm just saying it because it's like

02:54:26.340 --> 02:54:28.340
There's different ideas that are possible. Yeah

02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:30.340
okay. So yeah I'm not saying

02:54:30.340 --> 02:54:32.340
it's definitely testosterone. There's other things

02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:34.340
it's also possible that it's culture. People

02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:36.340
are definitely going to bring that up. Based on my

02:54:36.340 --> 02:54:38.340
survey though it doesn't seem to be any evidence of that.

02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:40.340
Like I asked about like

02:54:40.340 --> 02:54:42.340
how much pressure was put on you to be

02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:44.340
you know agent-y in your

02:54:44.340 --> 02:54:46.340
childhood. Like a lot of questions around

02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:48.340
this kind of thing and no correlation

02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:50.340
at all to dominance. Well related

02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:52.340
to sexuality

02:54:52.340 --> 02:54:54.340
I'm very uncomfortable right now

02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:56.340
but nevertheless

02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:58.340
plow forward.

02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:00.340
In a dominant

02:55:00.340 --> 02:55:02.340
fashion.

02:55:03.340 --> 02:55:05.340
The blog post

02:55:05.340 --> 02:55:07.340
titled Rape Spectrum

02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:09.340
Survey Results.

02:55:09.340 --> 02:55:11.340
What are the key takeaways

02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:13.340
from that survey?

02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:15.340
So I did this survey when I had a friend

02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:17.340
be like hey I had this confusing sexual

02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:19.340
experience. Was it rape?

02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:21.340
Like somebody kind of pressured her

02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:23.340
and she eventually stopped saying it or something. I was like that's a great

02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:25.340
question. Like I don't know how people would consider

02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:27.340
this. And so I put a whole bunch of

02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:29.340
different gray scenarios

02:55:29.340 --> 02:55:31.340
into a survey and then

02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:33.340
asked people to rate how rapey they thought that

02:55:33.340 --> 02:55:35.340
scenario was. So you actually like little

02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:37.340
narratives

02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:39.340
that they get to rate?

02:55:39.340 --> 02:55:41.340
Like you know this person is on a date with

02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:43.340
this person they get drunk and the other person is not

02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:45.340
drunk. I try to keep gender neutral

02:55:45.340 --> 02:55:47.340
names for all of them.

02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:49.340
And you reduce them into a more

02:55:49.340 --> 02:55:51.340
concise description of the situation?

02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:53.340
Yeah. Like in this visualization so you have

02:55:53.340 --> 02:55:55.340
this rape spectrum that's a result

02:55:55.340 --> 02:55:57.340
where on top

02:55:57.340 --> 02:55:59.340
are things that are less likely to be

02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:01.340
considered rape by the people that took the survey

02:56:01.340 --> 02:56:03.340
and the bottom more likely.

02:56:03.340 --> 02:56:05.340
The likeliest

02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:07.340
is a stranger forcibly assaults

02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:09.340
someone who screams and fights the entire

02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:11.340
time that gets a hundred.

02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:15.340
What do we make of something that's not zero?

02:56:15.340 --> 02:56:17.340
It's like a twelve is what?

02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:19.340
How are we supposed to interpret a twelve out of a hundred on a rape?

02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:21.340
Extremely low.

02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:23.340
It's like not zero but it's just very close

02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:25.340
to it. Having sex with

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:27.340
an enthusiastic sex

02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:29.340
worker is a twelve.

02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:31.340
That's the lowest one.

02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:33.340
And there's a few I'll just mention a few

02:56:33.340 --> 02:56:35.340
that are lower.

02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:37.340
At that level.

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:39.340
Have sex to make a partner happy in a relationship.

02:56:39.340 --> 02:56:41.340
Lying about wealth

02:56:41.340 --> 02:56:43.340
hobbies in order to get laid.

02:56:43.340 --> 02:56:45.340
Person with

02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:47.340
Down syndrome eagerly has sex with

02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:49.340
a neurotypical. Not revealing

02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:51.340
being transgender until after

02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:53.340
sex and so on. I think you mentioned

02:56:53.340 --> 02:56:55.340
that there's some like that

02:56:55.340 --> 02:56:57.340
revealing being transgender until after sex.

02:56:57.340 --> 02:56:59.340
There's some differences

02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:01.340
amongst what men and

02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.340
women or something like that. I think that's the one that men

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:05.340
found more offensive than women.

02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:07.340
I wrote it a while ago.

02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:11.340
This is nuanced

02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:13.340
and difficult, right?

02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:15.340
Because I think in a lot of public discourse

02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:17.340
the word rape is pretty binary.

02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:19.340
Yeah. It's like either is or is

02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:21.340
not rape. And so you had a friend

02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:23.340
where it was like this felt rapey.

02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:25.340
Yeah she's like confused about how to interpret it.

02:57:25.340 --> 02:57:27.340
And I think people look to the terms

02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:29.340
to know how to feel about something.

02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:31.340
Like have you ever like been through an experience

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:33.340
you're like that was weird and then you tell it to somebody else and they're like

02:57:33.340 --> 02:57:35.340
oh my god you were assaulted.

02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:37.340
And then it totally recontextualizes

02:57:37.340 --> 02:57:39.340
the thing that you've experienced. And

02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:41.340
I think that this is clunky with the word rape

02:57:41.340 --> 02:57:43.340
because either you were raped or you're not.

02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:45.340
You either like have this entire context

02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:47.340
like a thrust upon you or you don't.

02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:49.340
And we're really not nuanced about it at all.

02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:51.340
And so I would really like to have some sort of like

02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:53.340
oh that was like a 30% rape you just endured.

02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:57.340
Yeah and I mean there's probably other dimensions

02:57:57.340 --> 02:57:59.340
about how traumatic it is. How difficult it is

02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:01.340
to recover from. All that kind of stuff.

02:58:01.340 --> 02:58:03.340
Yeah. I mean like people

02:58:03.340 --> 02:58:05.340
it's a dangerous thing to assign a word

02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:07.340
to an experience.

02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:09.340
Like even or to a relationship. Like

02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:11.340
saying a toxic relationship.

02:58:11.340 --> 02:58:13.340
Yeah. That can completely destroy

02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:15.340
your perception of that relationship.

02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:17.340
Yeah absolutely. I remember this was

02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:19.340
the case with my childhood. Like I talked about being very abusive.

02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:21.340
I've talked about how like there was a good amount of meaning

02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:23.340
there so that I didn't process it

02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:25.340
as abusive at the time. And I remember after

02:58:25.340 --> 02:58:27.340
I got out of that house and that culture people

02:58:27.340 --> 02:58:29.340
would tell me oh your child was really abusive.

02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:31.340
And I was really confused by

02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:33.340
that because it's a total recontextualization

02:58:33.340 --> 02:58:35.340
of that narrative. It's like the

02:58:35.340 --> 02:58:37.340
things that I went through were not you know good

02:58:37.340 --> 02:58:39.340
and virtuous and had meaning. But rather

02:58:39.340 --> 02:58:41.340
those were like the result of you know parents

02:58:41.340 --> 02:58:43.340
who didn't like love you enough or something.

02:58:43.340 --> 02:58:45.340
And it even

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:47.340
though the concrete things that

02:58:47.340 --> 02:58:49.340
happened to me did not change. Like no

02:58:49.340 --> 02:58:51.340
facts shifted. The fact that

02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:53.340
like the interpretation of the facts shifted

02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:55.340
caused me quite a bit of distress for a

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:57.340
long time. I was like oh my god I'm you know

02:58:57.340 --> 02:58:59.340
I'm a traumatized like abused person. Like I went

02:58:59.340 --> 02:59:01.340
through an abusive childhood. And it was really hard

02:59:01.340 --> 02:59:03.340
for me. Made it worse. Like

02:59:03.340 --> 02:59:05.340
it's crazy the power that terms have.

02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:07.340
I think we didn't talk

02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:09.340
about this but how did you begin

02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:11.340
to overcome

02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:13.340
the trauma of your childhood?

02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:15.340
You mentioned LSD so drugs are part of it.

02:59:15.340 --> 02:59:17.340
What was the mental journey of that?

02:59:17.340 --> 02:59:19.340
I was doing LSD quite a lot

02:59:19.340 --> 02:59:21.340
when I was 21?

02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:23.340
What's it like by the way? I've never done LSD.

02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:25.340
It's very difficult to describe

02:59:25.340 --> 02:59:27.340
because it's like

02:59:27.340 --> 02:59:29.340
it changes sort of aspects

02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:31.340
about your environment that are invisible to you

02:59:31.340 --> 02:59:33.340
because they're so stable.

02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:35.340
Is it like if you can compare it to like

02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:37.340
psilocybin? Is it very different?

02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:39.340
Oh yeah. It's like similar. I forgot

02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:41.340
that you did shrooms. Yeah okay then you probably know.

02:59:41.340 --> 02:59:43.340
You know like the kind of shift that you have from cyber

02:59:43.340 --> 02:59:45.340
shrooms is roughly similar. It's like

02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:47.340
more clear I think. Shrooms is

02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:49.340
more like embodied but LSD

02:59:49.340 --> 02:59:51.340
is much more intellectual for me. It

02:59:51.340 --> 02:59:53.340
strikes different people differently. I prefer shrooms a lot.

02:59:53.340 --> 02:59:55.340
I'm sorry LSD. I prefer LSD a lot.

02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:57.340
Why is it not popularly

02:59:57.340 --> 02:59:59.340
like there seems to be a negative

02:59:59.340 --> 03:00:01.340
connotation to LSD because like

03:00:01.340 --> 03:00:03.340
it seems to potentially have like

03:00:03.340 --> 03:00:05.340
a destructive effect. Like maybe

03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:07.340
dosage is more difficult to get right or something

03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:09.340
like that? So actually a long time

03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:11.340
ago I did a survey on shrooms versus LSD.

03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:13.340
So I asked people and people had

03:00:13.340 --> 03:00:15.340
slightly stronger experiences on LSD overall

03:00:15.340 --> 03:00:17.340
I remember. But rated the experiences about

03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:19.340
is equally good.

03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:21.340
I think people like shrooms because it feels more natural

03:00:21.340 --> 03:00:23.340
quote unquote. But I think if you like

03:00:23.340 --> 03:00:25.340
fed somebody a shroom and like actually had

03:00:25.340 --> 03:00:27.340
the LSD molecule in it they would have a, they would think

03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:29.340
it felt very natural. But that's beside the point.

03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:31.340
I think

03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:33.340
people get kind of incoherent on LSD

03:00:33.340 --> 03:00:35.340
in a way that feels really alienating.

03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:37.340
Like I consider LSD, my

03:00:37.340 --> 03:00:39.340
LSD use very heavy to be one of the best

03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:41.340
decisions I ever made in my life but I definitely

03:00:41.340 --> 03:00:43.340
was incoherent for a lot of it. Like

03:00:43.340 --> 03:00:45.340
talking about like we're all one. Consciousness, everything

03:00:45.340 --> 03:00:47.340
is love man. You know and

03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:49.340
people are like. Why is that incoherent?

03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:51.340
So I think it's not incoherent.

03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:53.340
But like if you go around saying everything is love

03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:55.340
people are like this guy's kind of blasted out of

03:00:55.340 --> 03:00:57.340
his mind. This podcast

03:00:57.340 --> 03:00:59.340
is basically

03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:01.340
your LSD driven

03:01:01.340 --> 03:01:03.340
for a bunch of episodes. Yeah

03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:05.340
I get this for sure.

03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:07.340
It's not just about love but it's

03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:09.340
it's about

03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:11.340
like talking in that way about reality

03:01:11.340 --> 03:01:13.340
about the world. Yeah sure.

03:01:13.340 --> 03:01:15.340
It's like over fitting. The narratives

03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:17.340
that you make about the world become really vivid

03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:19.340
and so you pattern match just really

03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:21.340
aggressively. Like everything is connected

03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:23.340
and you come up with these explanations for things. And I

03:01:23.340 --> 03:01:25.340
think I was very fortunate. So I like this theory

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:27.340
about psychedelics where you either like belief construct

03:01:27.340 --> 03:01:29.340
or you don't. So you take psychedelics

03:01:29.340 --> 03:01:31.340
and it sort of like burns away

03:01:31.340 --> 03:01:33.340
a lot of your belief structure.

03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:35.340
And sometimes

03:01:35.340 --> 03:01:37.340
this happens and then you're like I need to like

03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:39.340
invent something to fill in the gaps. So you're like

03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:41.340
okay I think that maybe

03:01:41.340 --> 03:01:43.340
time is an illusion. So I must

03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:45.340
now believe that like we're actually in a time

03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:47.340
loop or like time travel is possible.

03:01:47.340 --> 03:01:49.340
So you experience time differently and then you come up

03:01:49.340 --> 03:01:51.340
with a different belief about time.

03:01:51.340 --> 03:01:53.340
Whereas other people don't do

03:01:53.340 --> 03:01:55.340
this belief construction at all. Like you

03:01:55.340 --> 03:01:57.340
experience time differently and you sort of let yourself

03:01:57.340 --> 03:01:59.340
not have a belief. You're not like okay

03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:01.340
and you're not developing any beliefs about time in

03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:03.340
its absence. You're just simply experiencing

03:02:03.340 --> 03:02:05.340
the absence of the concept of time.

03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:07.340
And so I don't have

03:02:07.340 --> 03:02:09.340
a lot of data to back this up in my anecdotal

03:02:09.340 --> 03:02:11.340
experience because I've tripped out a lot of people. People

03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:13.340
either tend to belief construct or they don't.

03:02:13.340 --> 03:02:15.340
And people who do not believe construct seem

03:02:15.340 --> 03:02:17.340
to get more out of their LSD trips. So if

03:02:17.340 --> 03:02:19.340
you can let a belief go without building anything

03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:21.340
in its absence, it's much

03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:23.340
more beneficial for you. And I think I just for some

03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:25.340
reason happen to have some brain that's constructed

03:02:25.340 --> 03:02:27.340
where I don't get

03:02:27.340 --> 03:02:29.340
belief construction at all.

03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:31.340
So that's really interesting that belief construction

03:02:31.340 --> 03:02:33.340
is negative.

03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:35.340
What?

03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:37.340
Is it necessarily negative? Can you elaborate on that

03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:39.340
a little bit? I mean belief construction in a way that's

03:02:39.340 --> 03:02:41.340
like

03:02:41.340 --> 03:02:43.340
not like playing with frames

03:02:43.340 --> 03:02:45.340
but rather committing to a different frame.

03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:47.340
So I like being

03:02:47.340 --> 03:02:49.340
able to play with ideas and be like let's look at it this way

03:02:49.340 --> 03:02:51.340
or that way. That's awesome. But if you're like okay

03:02:51.340 --> 03:02:53.340
you know what? I took LSD and now

03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:55.340
I absolutely believe the cops are outside.

03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:57.340
And you're like no you're just like

03:02:57.340 --> 03:02:59.340
you can't shift out of that. Your brain

03:02:59.340 --> 03:03:01.340
needs to fill in the gap. You're not allowed to have a gap.

03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:03.340
So you're not allowed to be flexible.

03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:05.340
And again I don't think this is like a personal failing

03:03:05.340 --> 03:03:07.340
if any. I think this is like literally probably

03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:09.340
genetic or like physical thing that's causing

03:03:09.340 --> 03:03:11.340
this. But do you think there's possible beliefs that are

03:03:11.340 --> 03:03:13.340
like enlightening that you can

03:03:13.340 --> 03:03:15.340
stick to? Like find a frame

03:03:15.340 --> 03:03:17.340
that like

03:03:17.340 --> 03:03:19.340
I guess if you don't

03:03:19.340 --> 03:03:21.340
believe constructing you're escaping your

03:03:21.340 --> 03:03:23.340
previous beliefs aren't you doing like just some

03:03:23.340 --> 03:03:25.340
you're picking up a bigger frame.

03:03:25.340 --> 03:03:27.340
Yeah. You're taking your beliefs as

03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:29.340
object as opposed to being subject to them.

03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:31.340
Ah got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.

03:03:31.340 --> 03:03:33.340
And some of that I guess is genetic and there's

03:03:33.340 --> 03:03:35.340
these categories of people. There's two categories

03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:37.340
that experience LSD in different ways.

03:03:37.340 --> 03:03:39.340
And you're one of those that are able to just let go.

03:03:39.340 --> 03:03:41.340
Yeah I just think I had a good reaction. And I think a lot

03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:43.340
of maybe the negative stereotype

03:03:43.340 --> 03:03:45.340
of LSD comes from people who are belief constructing

03:03:45.340 --> 03:03:47.340
or carry the belief constructing off

03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:49.340
of the LSD trap. So you take LSD and you're like

03:03:49.340 --> 03:03:51.340
ah I'm believing these insane things

03:03:51.340 --> 03:03:53.340
and people from the outside see that and they're like oh my god

03:03:53.340 --> 03:03:55.340
this person took LSD and became stupid.

03:03:55.340 --> 03:03:57.340
It's very scary.

03:03:57.340 --> 03:03:59.340
What's frame control?

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:01.340
Because that has been at the core of your

03:04:01.340 --> 03:04:03.340
trauma. At the core of

03:04:03.340 --> 03:04:05.340
your upbringing. What's frame control?

03:04:05.340 --> 03:04:07.340
And also sorry

03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:09.340
frame control in general because that's

03:04:09.340 --> 03:04:11.340
part of human interaction.

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:13.340
Yeah frame control

03:04:13.340 --> 03:04:15.340
is like a way of

03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:17.340
manipulating somebody else that is non

03:04:17.340 --> 03:04:19.340
obvious.

03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:21.340
So there's a negative connotation to that usually?

03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:23.340
Yeah. I mean I think

03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:25.340
maybe I chose the term kind of poorly because I think

03:04:25.340 --> 03:04:27.340
to some degree people are always a little bit

03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:29.340
manipulating each other. But I think it's generally obvious.

03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:31.340
Like for example if I disagree with you

03:04:31.340 --> 03:04:33.340
I want you to believe what I believe.

03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:35.340
But this is like an obvious thing that is like

03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:37.340
visible between. It's like an object on the table.

03:04:37.340 --> 03:04:39.340
It's like here's the box where I want

03:04:39.340 --> 03:04:41.340
you to believe what you want. The disagreement box.

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:43.340
Yeah so

03:04:43.340 --> 03:04:45.340
we're under a shared context where we understand

03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:47.340
that we're trying to move

03:04:47.340 --> 03:04:49.340
each other. This is chill to me.

03:04:49.340 --> 03:04:51.340
I think this is cool. We just all

03:04:51.340 --> 03:04:53.340
time and it's important. But frame control is

03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:55.340
the kind of thing where you are trying carefully

03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:57.340
to obscure the existence of that

03:04:57.340 --> 03:04:59.340
box. You're like oh

03:04:59.340 --> 03:05:01.340
the thing that I'm doing I'm like using tactics

03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:03.340
to try to influence what

03:05:03.340 --> 03:05:05.340
your reality is without

03:05:05.340 --> 03:05:07.340
us being both aware that this is what I'm

03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:09.340
doing. Yeah I've been assuming you're doing

03:05:09.340 --> 03:05:11.340
that the whole time.

03:05:11.340 --> 03:05:13.340
No. Oh my god.

03:05:13.340 --> 03:05:15.340
I have to like figure out how to read your

03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:17.340
facial expressions. I'm still learning. There's none.

03:05:17.340 --> 03:05:19.340
There's none. You don't have any? I'm like

03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:21.340
I'm not even like a Chad

03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:23.340
GBT. I'm like GBT one

03:05:23.340 --> 03:05:25.340
with my facial expressions. Like it's kind of off.

03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:27.340
Like this doesn't seem to match emotions

03:05:27.340 --> 03:05:29.340
but it's kind of intelligent seemingly

03:05:29.340 --> 03:05:31.340
but definitely not conscious. Anyway

03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:33.340
so like negative connotation

03:05:33.340 --> 03:05:35.340
manipulating

03:05:35.340 --> 03:05:37.340
not being honest about

03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:39.340
the actual intentions

03:05:39.340 --> 03:05:41.340
of the

03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:43.340
of how you'd like to control the conversation.

03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:45.340
I think there might be a naive version of interpreting

03:05:45.340 --> 03:05:47.340
this where you're just like oh I'm trying to like

03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:49.340
subtly get you to believe like oh

03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:51.340
do you really think that's bad though? But

03:05:51.340 --> 03:05:53.340
this is not quite what I mean. I mean there's like a couple

03:05:53.340 --> 03:05:55.340
of concrete things that are signs of frame control.

03:05:55.340 --> 03:05:57.340
Like one of them is pushing the painful update

03:05:57.340 --> 03:05:59.340
button which is this thing where it's

03:05:59.340 --> 03:06:01.340
like hey

03:06:01.340 --> 03:06:03.340
if you learn this

03:06:03.340 --> 03:06:05.340
it's going to be really painful. The truth is painful.

03:06:05.340 --> 03:06:07.340
And if you're

03:06:07.340 --> 03:06:09.340
realizing this thing about yourself it's going to hurt

03:06:09.340 --> 03:06:11.340
and this is a sign that you're heading in the right direction.

03:06:11.340 --> 03:06:13.340
So if you frame all pain

03:06:13.340 --> 03:06:15.340
as a sign of virtue then this

03:06:15.340 --> 03:06:17.340
means that pain that's resulting as

03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:19.340
damage is something you're going to ignore.

03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:21.340
So it's like this is

03:06:21.340 --> 03:06:23.340
common like cults right? This is for your own good.

03:06:23.340 --> 03:06:25.340
Oh you know you've

03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:27.340
faced the brave truth about yourself

03:06:27.340 --> 03:06:29.340
that you're like not quite as wise as I am.

03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:31.340
When really your brain might be trying

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:33.340
to tell you protective things. Or like another one is like

03:06:33.340 --> 03:06:35.340
finger trap beliefs where

03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:37.340
the belief is constructed in such a way that

03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:39.340
doubting it lends proof to the

03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:41.340
belief. So very common example

03:06:41.340 --> 03:06:43.340
is like Satan. Like the

03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:45.340
Christians are like you know Satan is going to

03:06:45.340 --> 03:06:47.340
try to make you doubt him. The

03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:49.340
existence of him. He's going to so doubt like maybe he's not actually

03:06:49.340 --> 03:06:51.340
real. And so if you believe

03:06:51.340 --> 03:06:53.340
in Satan and then you're like okay now I'm

03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:55.340
having doubts like maybe he isn't real. This is like

03:06:55.340 --> 03:06:57.340
oh this is exactly what I was taught to expect.

03:06:57.340 --> 03:06:59.340
Like I am doubting this belief because

03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:01.340
I was told because like this is what

03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:03.340
Satan does and it's taken as evidence for it.

03:07:03.340 --> 03:07:05.340
So like the attempt to move away from the belief

03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:07.340
like rebounds

03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:09.340
on you and like causes you to be more

03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:11.340
embedded inside of the belief.

03:07:11.340 --> 03:07:13.340
So it's like techniques like these like very subtle

03:07:13.340 --> 03:07:15.340
things where like being inside of the system

03:07:15.340 --> 03:07:17.340
sort of just self reinforces the system

03:07:17.340 --> 03:07:19.340
is what I consider to be frame control.

03:07:19.340 --> 03:07:21.340
And have you met people

03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:23.340
that are really good at this kind of frame

03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:25.340
control? Yeah.

03:07:25.340 --> 03:07:27.340
Yeah definitely. So like

03:07:27.340 --> 03:07:29.340
you're saying that your father

03:07:29.340 --> 03:07:31.340
was like that? Yeah to be fair I'm not sure he was

03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:33.340
good at it because I was a kid. Right.

03:07:33.340 --> 03:07:35.340
I think he's probably not very good at it

03:07:35.340 --> 03:07:37.340
actually but when you're a child being

03:07:37.340 --> 03:07:39.340
raised in a house where he works from home and you're homeschooled

03:07:39.340 --> 03:07:41.340
it's just kind of what's going to happen.

03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:43.340
And to be fair I do think that like

03:07:43.340 --> 03:07:45.340
strong frame control is quite rare.

03:07:45.340 --> 03:07:47.340
I don't think most people are kind of doing something

03:07:47.340 --> 03:07:49.340
like this but not nearly to the degree that

03:07:49.340 --> 03:07:51.340
gives me the ick. Yeah.

03:07:51.340 --> 03:07:53.340
I've met maybe like five or six people I think

03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:55.340
who I really don't like because

03:07:55.340 --> 03:07:57.340
of those very subtle things that they're doing.

03:07:57.340 --> 03:07:59.340
I think also I'm starting

03:07:59.340 --> 03:08:01.340
to kind of understand

03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.340
that there is people who are

03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:05.340
narcissists and sociopaths and psychopaths

03:08:05.340 --> 03:08:07.340
out there.

03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:09.340
And

03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:11.340
I'm not even sure if people like

03:08:11.340 --> 03:08:13.340
that because I think they get good

03:08:13.340 --> 03:08:15.340
at frame control

03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:17.340
but I don't know if they're aware they're doing

03:08:17.340 --> 03:08:19.340
it. Oh yeah. Which makes

03:08:19.340 --> 03:08:21.340
me also nervous about myself like

03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:23.340
am I doing frame control?

03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:25.340
Yeah that's one of the big things

03:08:25.340 --> 03:08:27.340
it's like typically people

03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:29.340
you can't think about incentive

03:08:29.340 --> 03:08:31.340
like you can't think about oh is this person trying to

03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:33.340
do it or not. Yeah. That's like not the quite

03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:35.340
not the way you have to look at one of the effects.

03:08:35.340 --> 03:08:37.340
You're automatically looking at the effects.

03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:39.340
And then you also have to do that with yourself

03:08:39.340 --> 03:08:41.340
when you have the interactions with others.

03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:43.340
It's like very much like are you like

03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:45.340
how much space are you making for the other person's

03:08:45.340 --> 03:08:47.340
reality here? Like

03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:49.340
are you giving power to the other

03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:51.340
person? Because a big aspect of frame control

03:08:51.340 --> 03:08:53.340
is you're carefully rerouting the power to yourself.

03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:55.340
You're like I am the person

03:08:55.340 --> 03:08:57.340
who knows. Like you're having pain

03:08:57.340 --> 03:08:59.340
in your beliefs because you're updating towards the

03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:01.340
things that I believe. Like it's

03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:03.340
just like a gravity well. But if

03:09:03.340 --> 03:09:05.340
you're setting up the gravity well of your interactions such that you're making

03:09:05.340 --> 03:09:07.340
sure you're giving the other person power

03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:09.340
over the shared reality you inhabit

03:09:09.340 --> 03:09:11.340
it's a really good sign that you're not doing frame control.

03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:13.340
So if you're making

03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:15.340
room for them. Yeah. Okay.

03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:17.340
Unless we're talking about in bed

03:09:17.340 --> 03:09:19.340
then it's all general

03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:21.340
relativity from there and black holes and stuff.

03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:23.340
Frame control. Bed frame control.

03:09:23.340 --> 03:09:25.340
Bed frame control.

03:09:25.340 --> 03:09:27.340
It took me a long time to get a bed

03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:29.340
frame. Just I'm saying.

03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:31.340
Wow. But you wear a suit though.

03:09:33.340 --> 03:09:35.340
Yeah. So frame control

03:09:35.340 --> 03:09:37.340
on the streets. No frame in the

03:09:37.340 --> 03:09:39.340
sheets. I don't know. I don't know what the funny thing

03:09:39.340 --> 03:09:41.340
is to say but there you have it.

03:09:41.340 --> 03:09:43.340
So

03:09:43.340 --> 03:09:45.340
the LSD helped you escape the

03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:47.340
frame

03:09:47.340 --> 03:09:49.340
of, can you like

03:09:49.340 --> 03:09:51.340
elaborate what was the frame that

03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:53.340
was

03:09:53.340 --> 03:09:55.340
holding you back

03:09:55.340 --> 03:09:57.340
from

03:09:57.340 --> 03:09:59.340
like the frame constructed by your

03:09:59.340 --> 03:10:01.340
childhood experience that was holding you back

03:10:01.340 --> 03:10:03.340
as an intellectual, as a thinker, as a

03:10:03.340 --> 03:10:05.340
free being in this world?

03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:07.340
I was really fucked up.

03:10:07.340 --> 03:10:09.340
Like after I left home and I absorbed

03:10:09.340 --> 03:10:11.340
the external narrative that I had been abused

03:10:11.340 --> 03:10:13.340
which technically is true.

03:10:13.340 --> 03:10:15.340
I'm not saying I wasn't but like I absorbed this

03:10:15.340 --> 03:10:17.340
narrative and I just remember having

03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:19.340
this burning coals in my chest at all

03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:21.340
times. Like if I had to call

03:10:21.340 --> 03:10:23.340
out of my factory work when Father's Day happened

03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:25.340
because I was spending the whole day sobbing because everybody was talking about

03:10:25.340 --> 03:10:27.340
their fathers. Like I was

03:10:27.340 --> 03:10:29.340
really messed up and it's because I

03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:31.340
held this important thing, this idea,

03:10:31.340 --> 03:10:33.340
this frame that

03:10:33.340 --> 03:10:35.340
I had been deeply wronged. Like there

03:10:35.340 --> 03:10:37.340
was a correct way of being and the world

03:10:37.340 --> 03:10:39.340
had violated that. Something should not

03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:41.340
have happened. Like my father should

03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:43.340
have loved me. And it was like this

03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:45.340
like the

03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:47.340
shearing in the nature of reality and

03:10:47.340 --> 03:10:49.340
that was really agonizing to have.

03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:51.340
And LSD really

03:10:51.340 --> 03:10:53.340
messes with frames a lot. It takes

03:10:53.340 --> 03:10:55.340
like what you think is normal and really screws with it.

03:10:55.340 --> 03:10:57.340
And I did an LSD like several times before

03:10:57.340 --> 03:10:59.340
but there's one LSD trip where

03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:01.340
I went through my entire

03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:03.340
childhood in my head because LSD like really

03:11:03.340 --> 03:11:05.340
makes your memories quite vivid.

03:11:05.340 --> 03:11:07.340
Like anything you visualize it's like you're in it.

03:11:07.340 --> 03:11:09.340
And so I just went in very carefully,

03:11:09.340 --> 03:11:11.340
deliberately went and remembered every single

03:11:11.340 --> 03:11:13.340
memory that I could have that was really

03:11:13.340 --> 03:11:15.340
painful for me. Like the times that

03:11:15.340 --> 03:11:17.340
I lost friends and all the things

03:11:17.340 --> 03:11:19.340
I valued and like being broken because like my

03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:21.340
parents, especially my dad, would refer to like

03:11:21.340 --> 03:11:23.340
breaking me like explicitly. We're going to break

03:11:23.340 --> 03:11:25.340
your will. And so all these times where I was like

03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.340
they had successfully broken my will over and over

03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:29.340
and it was horrible. I was just like sobbing,

03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:31.340
tears streaming down my face.

03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:33.340
And then I like

03:11:33.340 --> 03:11:35.340
worked through my whole childhood. I got to the end

03:11:35.340 --> 03:11:37.340
and I'm going to tear up because every time I talk about

03:11:37.340 --> 03:11:39.340
this is just like the sensation

03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:41.340
of like being free

03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:43.340
from that for the first time

03:11:43.340 --> 03:11:45.340
is so

03:11:45.340 --> 03:11:47.340
incredible. Like I remember

03:11:47.340 --> 03:11:49.340
being outside of my house and

03:11:49.340 --> 03:11:51.340
being able to like

03:11:51.340 --> 03:11:53.340
go where I wanted and think what I

03:11:53.340 --> 03:11:55.340
wanted and

03:11:55.340 --> 03:11:57.340
it was just so blissful.

03:11:57.340 --> 03:11:59.340
And I was soaked

03:11:59.340 --> 03:12:01.340
in this gratitude on this trip.

03:12:01.340 --> 03:12:03.340
Just like

03:12:03.340 --> 03:12:05.340
vibrating with complete joy

03:12:05.340 --> 03:12:07.340
for everything. Like I was just looking around like I could touch

03:12:07.340 --> 03:12:09.340
anything. Like I could cry if I wanted to.

03:12:09.340 --> 03:12:11.340
I wasn't allowed to cry. I was allowed to be

03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:13.340
depressed. I was trying to, I got depressed as

03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:15.340
a child and my parents were like if you keep being

03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:17.340
depressed we're going to like force you to scrub the whole

03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:19.340
house. Like just like the ability

03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:21.340
to have a feeling

03:12:21.340 --> 03:12:23.340
was so

03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:25.340
thrilling and I was so grateful for this. I was like

03:12:25.340 --> 03:12:27.340
I would do anything to give this experience to someone

03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:29.340
else. I would do anything

03:12:29.340 --> 03:12:31.340
even if it was like putting them through what I went through.

03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:33.340
And then like with that realization

03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:35.340
I was like oh it was worth it. The thing

03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:37.340
that I went through was worth it for this. I would do

03:12:37.340 --> 03:12:39.340
it again. To like be able to

03:12:39.340 --> 03:12:41.340
have this deep gratitude for

03:12:41.340 --> 03:12:43.340
what I have now. And then that

03:12:43.340 --> 03:12:45.340
shifted the meaning frame. Because before

03:12:45.340 --> 03:12:47.340
the meaning had been like something had sheared. Something

03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:49.340
like shouldn't have happened. But now it was like

03:12:49.340 --> 03:12:51.340
the exact right thing had happened.

03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:53.340
It's almost a gift. Yeah.

03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:55.340
I was like ah, I would not give up my childhood.

03:12:55.340 --> 03:12:57.340
I would do it again.

03:12:57.340 --> 03:12:59.340
And I believe that to this day. For the moment of

03:12:59.340 --> 03:13:01.340
discovering that freedom. Yeah.

03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:03.340
Because like everything

03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:05.340
now, my whole life is in contrast

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:07.340
to that. And it's awesome.

03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:09.340
It's fucking great. I'm

03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:11.340
really thrilled about it.

03:13:11.340 --> 03:13:13.340
Do you, is

03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:15.340
there a part of you that hates your

03:13:15.340 --> 03:13:17.340
father still? Kind of.

03:13:17.340 --> 03:13:19.340
I don't want a relationship with anymore.

03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:21.340
After that there was some forgiveness. Like I had

03:13:21.340 --> 03:13:23.340
this burning, I would have nightmares about

03:13:23.340 --> 03:13:25.340
him killing me or something. And after that

03:13:25.340 --> 03:13:27.340
it kind of stopped. Like the fire in my

03:13:27.340 --> 03:13:29.340
chest went away permanently after that trip. It was

03:13:29.340 --> 03:13:31.340
so fast. It was like before I was fucked

03:13:31.340 --> 03:13:33.340
up. After that trip I woke up the next day

03:13:33.340 --> 03:13:35.340
and I was clean. It was

03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:37.340
really severe. And I

03:13:37.340 --> 03:13:39.340
definitely don't want to be around

03:13:39.340 --> 03:13:41.340
him still. Like he still like triggers the

03:13:41.340 --> 03:13:43.340
fear in my body. But I don't have that

03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:45.340
hang up anymore. I'm like kind of

03:13:45.340 --> 03:13:47.340
over it. Like I've let go. He's

03:13:47.340 --> 03:13:49.340
his own person. Like ultimately

03:13:49.340 --> 03:13:51.340
he didn't get to decide who he was in the same

03:13:51.340 --> 03:13:53.340
way that I didn't get to decide who I was.

03:13:53.340 --> 03:13:55.340
So that's almost like a kind of

03:13:55.340 --> 03:13:57.340
at least intellectual like forgiveness

03:13:57.340 --> 03:13:59.340
you have for him. Yeah.

03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:05.340
So that trip just took you

03:14:05.340 --> 03:14:07.340
through your whole, were you

03:14:07.340 --> 03:14:09.340
alone by the way when you were doing the trip?

03:14:09.340 --> 03:14:11.340
I had roommates but the trip was

03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:13.340
mostly alone. I had somebody else who was like sitting in the room

03:14:13.340 --> 03:14:15.340
but they weren't interacting with me.

03:14:15.340 --> 03:14:17.340
So you're sitting there experiencing all

03:14:17.340 --> 03:14:19.340
of this. What's the timeline? Like how long

03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:21.340
does it take to go through your

03:14:21.340 --> 03:14:23.340
whole childhood? I don't remember. I mean time's really messed

03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:25.340
up when you, when you do that.

03:14:25.340 --> 03:14:27.340
I was listening to the soundtrack of The Fountain which is

03:14:27.340 --> 03:14:29.340
excellent. Yeah. I listened to that

03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:31.340
a lot when I did LSD.

03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:33.340
I know it was probably a couple hours.

03:14:33.340 --> 03:14:35.340
That's amazing. I mean it's like

03:14:35.340 --> 03:14:37.340
it would be

03:14:37.340 --> 03:14:39.340
it's just like a vivid

03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:41.340
experience of your childhood.

03:14:41.340 --> 03:14:43.340
Moment by moment. Trauma by trauma.

03:14:43.340 --> 03:14:45.340
And it's good to experience it

03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:47.340
purely. Like it just is what it is.

03:14:47.340 --> 03:14:49.340
It just is grief. Like it is

03:14:49.340 --> 03:14:51.340
loss.

03:14:51.340 --> 03:14:53.340
And you just are in it without having to

03:14:53.340 --> 03:14:55.340
make it be anything.

03:14:57.340 --> 03:14:59.340
And it's so interesting that you can

03:14:59.340 --> 03:15:01.340
I mean work through that. So for a lot of

03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:03.340
us, for a lot of human beings

03:15:03.340 --> 03:15:05.340
like childhood is full of those kind

03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:07.340
of mini

03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:09.340
traumas. Big or small.

03:15:09.340 --> 03:15:11.340
And like working through that. It feels like

03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:13.340
what a lot of life is about is trying to work

03:15:13.340 --> 03:15:15.340
through that. And it feels

03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:17.340
like you have to kind of relive it.

03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:19.340
I guess that's what therapy is about in part.

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.340
To be able to vocalize it.

03:15:21.340 --> 03:15:23.340
This is why I feel really

03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:25.340
confused about the concept of trauma. Like people use

03:15:25.340 --> 03:15:27.340
this word so much. Like are you traumatized?

03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:29.340
And I understand why.

03:15:29.340 --> 03:15:31.340
This is why I feel confused about it. But part of me is like

03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:33.340
I wonder if by using that term we're creating

03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:35.340
the trauma in people. They were using the

03:15:35.340 --> 03:15:37.340
frame where the thing that happened to you was not supposed to happen.

03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:39.340
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there needs to be a different

03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:41.340
frame. No, I agree with you totally.

03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:43.340
I just, I've made friends

03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:45.340
with and talked to this guy

03:15:45.340 --> 03:15:47.340
named Paul Conti.

03:15:47.340 --> 03:15:49.340
He wrote a book on trauma.

03:15:49.340 --> 03:15:51.340
He's an incredible, brilliant psychiatrist.

03:15:51.340 --> 03:15:53.340
Yeah, he probably agrees with you kind of.

03:15:53.340 --> 03:15:55.340
That's cool. I should read it.

03:15:55.340 --> 03:15:57.340
Yeah, you should. Maybe even

03:15:57.340 --> 03:15:59.340
talk to him. He's a fascinating human being.

03:15:59.340 --> 03:16:01.340
I'd be interested in

03:16:03.340 --> 03:16:05.340
a psychiatrist perspective is really

03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:07.340
interesting because it's a,

03:16:07.340 --> 03:16:09.340
you've been doing kind of an in-person

03:16:09.340 --> 03:16:11.340
survey.

03:16:11.340 --> 03:16:13.340
Because you've done so many patients.

03:16:13.340 --> 03:16:15.340
Like he's,

03:16:15.340 --> 03:16:17.340
like just talking to him

03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:19.340
is fascinating because

03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:21.340
like if I describe my

03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:23.340
experience or somebody else's experience,

03:16:23.340 --> 03:16:25.340
I could see his brain mapping

03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:27.340
it in interesting ways

03:16:27.340 --> 03:16:29.340
to the tens of thousands of

03:16:29.340 --> 03:16:31.340
data points he has in his

03:16:31.340 --> 03:16:33.340
head. And it's like, of

03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:35.340
course, that's what doctors do, but it's cool as

03:16:35.340 --> 03:16:37.340
the doctor is basically the

03:16:37.340 --> 03:16:39.340
doctor of the mind. And

03:16:39.340 --> 03:16:41.340
To have like an actual

03:16:41.340 --> 03:16:43.340
like qualitative data.

03:16:43.340 --> 03:16:45.340
And be able to, I mean, that's where the poetic stuff comes

03:16:45.340 --> 03:16:47.340
in. Ultimately, as a psychiatrist, you're

03:16:47.340 --> 03:16:49.340
exploring the human mind

03:16:49.340 --> 03:16:51.340
with a bit of a sort of romantic element.

03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:53.340
Yeah. You can't be really

03:16:53.340 --> 03:16:55.340
systematic about it. But

03:16:55.340 --> 03:16:57.340
it does seem like, frame or

03:16:57.340 --> 03:16:59.340
not, be able to just

03:16:59.340 --> 03:17:01.340
talk through the experiences

03:17:01.340 --> 03:17:03.340
you had is really

03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:05.340
powerful. What about it is appealing? Is it just

03:17:05.340 --> 03:17:07.340
like being able to revisit it with

03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:09.340
new eyes? No, I don't know exactly.

03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:11.340
It just seems to work for people.

03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:13.340
I don't know if it's appealing. It just seems like

03:17:13.340 --> 03:17:15.340
almost acknowledging

03:17:15.340 --> 03:17:17.340
to yourself that

03:17:17.340 --> 03:17:19.340
things happen.

03:17:19.340 --> 03:17:21.340
Like I've said,

03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:23.340
I think I've said this before, my brother who

03:17:23.340 --> 03:17:25.340
I love very much, tried to set me on

03:17:25.340 --> 03:17:27.340
fire a few times. And

03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:29.340
I think to me it's funny, but

03:17:29.340 --> 03:17:31.340
I wonder if I didn't talk about it,

03:17:31.340 --> 03:17:33.340
like if that would be traumatic, maybe

03:17:33.340 --> 03:17:35.340
talking and laughing about it.

03:17:35.340 --> 03:17:37.340
Because it was traumatic to me at the time.

03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:39.340
I was like, I love you, why are you setting me on

03:17:39.340 --> 03:17:41.340
fire? But it's what kids do when they're like, yeah.

03:17:43.340 --> 03:17:45.340
I was like, whatever,

03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:47.340
it's what boys do. They're

03:17:47.340 --> 03:17:49.340
crazy.

03:17:49.340 --> 03:17:51.340
It makes total sense.

03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:53.340
It's probably funny from his perspective.

03:17:53.340 --> 03:17:55.340
But yeah, I wonder,

03:17:55.340 --> 03:17:57.340
I want to bring that to the surface if that helps.

03:17:57.340 --> 03:17:59.340
So maybe LSD allows you to,

03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:01.340
or different drugs, depending

03:18:01.340 --> 03:18:03.340
on the person, allows you to more vividly

03:18:03.340 --> 03:18:05.340
bring it to the surface.

03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:07.340
And then depending on your genetics,

03:18:07.340 --> 03:18:09.340
be able to find a better frame.

03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:11.340
That's fascinating.

03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:13.340
You and mine is freaking fascinating.

03:18:15.340 --> 03:18:17.340
Alright.

03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:19.340
What's romantic to you,

03:18:19.340 --> 03:18:21.340
by the way?

03:18:21.340 --> 03:18:23.340
I'm not a big romance person.

03:18:23.340 --> 03:18:25.340
So to you,

03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:27.340
romantic is like

03:18:27.340 --> 03:18:29.340
objective analysis

03:18:29.340 --> 03:18:31.340
of the interactions between

03:18:31.340 --> 03:18:33.340
humans? A little bit.

03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:35.340
I do find kind of the survey process that I did

03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:37.340
to be romantic.

03:18:37.340 --> 03:18:39.340
The guy that I asked out, who I'm

03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:41.340
still dating, I was like, hey, you scored on my

03:18:41.340 --> 03:18:43.340
survey, you want to go eat food or

03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:45.340
something? And his response was like, you want

03:18:45.340 --> 03:18:47.340
to try doing three days in an Airbnb

03:18:47.340 --> 03:18:49.340
as our first date? And I was like,

03:18:49.340 --> 03:18:51.340
yeah, and that was romantic.

03:18:51.340 --> 03:18:53.340
That was a bold leap into

03:18:53.340 --> 03:18:55.340
a really intense date.

03:18:55.340 --> 03:18:57.340
I think you mentioned

03:18:57.340 --> 03:18:59.340
something also,

03:18:59.340 --> 03:19:01.340
must have been a tweet

03:19:01.340 --> 03:19:03.340
or something like that, where

03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:05.340
if you,

03:19:05.340 --> 03:19:07.340
if people want you to show up to

03:19:07.340 --> 03:19:09.340
a thing,

03:19:09.340 --> 03:19:11.340
give the time, the location,

03:19:11.340 --> 03:19:13.340
the dress code,

03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:17.340
and

03:19:17.340 --> 03:19:19.340
no pressure for you to be there.

03:19:19.340 --> 03:19:21.340
But like, show up if you want.

03:19:21.340 --> 03:19:23.340
That was your specification.

03:19:23.340 --> 03:19:25.340
That's a great memory, yeah. And then I think you said

03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:27.340
that you did that for like some

03:19:27.340 --> 03:19:29.340
castle in south, south of France.

03:19:29.340 --> 03:19:31.340
I did, yeah.

03:19:31.340 --> 03:19:33.340
I was in my early 20s. People, my friends

03:19:33.340 --> 03:19:35.340
at home were taking prediction markets on whether or not

03:19:35.340 --> 03:19:37.340
I was going to get abducted and killed.

03:19:37.340 --> 03:19:39.340
Yeah, what was that like? I mean,

03:19:39.340 --> 03:19:41.340
what,

03:19:41.340 --> 03:19:43.340
you've traveled quite a bit. Like, do you take these

03:19:43.340 --> 03:19:45.340
giant risks? What's with that?

03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:47.340
I think I used to more when I was younger with the traveling.

03:19:47.340 --> 03:19:49.340
I think I'm like a little traveled out now, but

03:19:49.340 --> 03:19:51.340
like my first, when I moved out of Idaho for the first

03:19:51.340 --> 03:19:53.340
time, I moved to Australia. Just kind of

03:19:53.340 --> 03:19:55.340
yeeted myself across the globe.

03:19:55.340 --> 03:19:57.340
Which verb did you just use?

03:19:57.340 --> 03:19:59.340
Yeah, yeet.

03:19:59.340 --> 03:20:01.340
It's like yeet to yoat.

03:20:01.340 --> 03:20:03.340
Yeeted. Yeet.

03:20:03.340 --> 03:20:05.340
So do people, is this like slang?

03:20:05.340 --> 03:20:07.340
Is this like Urban Dictionary? Is this actual

03:20:07.340 --> 03:20:09.340
or is this Webster? Yeah, you have to like feel into the word.

03:20:09.340 --> 03:20:11.340
Like if you take a thing and you just like curl it

03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:13.340
really hard, it does not feel

03:20:13.340 --> 03:20:15.340
like a yeet motion.

03:20:15.340 --> 03:20:17.340
Okay, so you yeeted. So

03:20:17.340 --> 03:20:19.340
it was aggressive. So across the globe

03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:21.340
you didn't even stop.

03:20:21.340 --> 03:20:23.340
Just hurled

03:20:23.340 --> 03:20:25.340
myself, yeah. I just kept

03:20:25.340 --> 03:20:27.340
yeeting myself in various places, yeah.

03:20:27.340 --> 03:20:29.340
And so at one point I was done, okay Cupid, and somebody

03:20:29.340 --> 03:20:31.340
sent me a long message being like you should

03:20:31.340 --> 03:20:33.340
come to, I don't know, I'm hosting a castle.

03:20:33.340 --> 03:20:35.340
It's some people that I met

03:20:35.340 --> 03:20:37.340
like I have no idea who you are, but I just bought

03:20:37.340 --> 03:20:39.340
a plane ticket.

03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:41.340
And it was life changing. I ended up dating that guy

03:20:41.340 --> 03:20:43.340
for years and he

03:20:43.340 --> 03:20:45.340
changed my life quite a bit because he like was very

03:20:45.340 --> 03:20:47.340
agent-y in the world, and before that I wasn't

03:20:47.340 --> 03:20:49.340
agent-y. Agent-y like

03:20:51.340 --> 03:20:53.340
expressing agency. So it sounds like you were

03:20:53.340 --> 03:20:55.340
and don't you have to express

03:20:55.340 --> 03:20:57.340
agency when you're yeeting yourself

03:20:57.340 --> 03:20:59.340
across the world? Yeah, but only a little bit.

03:20:59.340 --> 03:21:01.340
Like in the same way you express agency when you eat LSD.

03:21:01.340 --> 03:21:03.340
Like the only thing you actually do in eating

03:21:03.340 --> 03:21:05.340
LSD is like put the tab in your mouth

03:21:05.340 --> 03:21:07.340
and then you just kind of scream the whole way

03:21:07.340 --> 03:21:09.340
after that. Yeah. But

03:21:09.340 --> 03:21:11.340
there's a lot of other things, like I didn't feel

03:21:11.340 --> 03:21:13.340
powerful enough to like go make

03:21:13.340 --> 03:21:15.340
events happen or anything.

03:21:15.340 --> 03:21:17.340
And it was this guy,

03:21:17.340 --> 03:21:19.340
he had a lot of agency

03:21:19.340 --> 03:21:21.340
in the sense that he would just sort of create

03:21:21.340 --> 03:21:23.340
realities through the people around him.

03:21:23.340 --> 03:21:25.340
Be like, okay, we're going to do this startup or we're going to

03:21:25.340 --> 03:21:27.340
throw this incredible event, like let's just do it.

03:21:27.340 --> 03:21:29.340
And it would somehow happen and it was really cool

03:21:29.340 --> 03:21:31.340
to see that.

03:21:31.340 --> 03:21:33.340
And so that one thing led to another and

03:21:33.340 --> 03:21:35.340
it was one of the biggest impacts on my life, I think.

03:21:35.340 --> 03:21:37.340
Yeah, that's pretty bold.

03:21:37.340 --> 03:21:39.340
I would say it's pretty romantic.

03:21:39.340 --> 03:21:41.340
South of France? Yeah, yeah, it was

03:21:41.340 --> 03:21:43.340
in a little castle. It was in the winter, so

03:21:43.340 --> 03:21:45.340
we were all cozyed up by the fire.

03:21:47.340 --> 03:21:49.340
I'm jumping around here.

03:21:49.340 --> 03:21:51.340
Twitter poll.

03:21:51.340 --> 03:21:53.340
Have you ever hitchhiked?

03:21:53.340 --> 03:21:55.340
You posted this Twitter poll.

03:21:55.340 --> 03:21:57.340
That was a big list of Twitter polls. Why did you pick

03:21:57.340 --> 03:21:59.340
the hitchhiking one? I don't know, because it's relevant

03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:01.340
to traveling.

03:22:01.340 --> 03:22:03.340
I don't like that one.

03:22:03.340 --> 03:22:05.340
That's romantic too, right? I'm actually

03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:07.340
terrified of hitchhiking, but I have done it a little bit.

03:22:07.340 --> 03:22:09.340
Oh, so it's terrifying. It's not romantic to you.

03:22:09.340 --> 03:22:11.340
So you're terrified of what?

03:22:11.340 --> 03:22:13.340
Interacting with strangers.

03:22:13.340 --> 03:22:15.340
That's terrifying.

03:22:15.340 --> 03:22:17.340
Still, you go to

03:22:17.340 --> 03:22:19.340
South of France.

03:22:19.340 --> 03:22:21.340
Yeah.

03:22:21.340 --> 03:22:23.340
But that was like a cohesive thing. I don't know.

03:22:23.340 --> 03:22:25.340
It made sense.

03:22:25.340 --> 03:22:27.340
There's like times where you're allowed to be weird and times where you're not.

03:22:27.340 --> 03:22:29.340
Who's allowing you?

03:22:29.340 --> 03:22:31.340
He had some

03:22:31.340 --> 03:22:33.340
fake eagerness for society, I'm not sure.

03:22:33.340 --> 03:22:35.340
But some people are like,

03:22:35.340 --> 03:22:37.340
hey, we think you're cool, come to this party.

03:22:37.340 --> 03:22:39.340
You're like, all right, I'm allowed to come to this party and be really weird.

03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:41.340
But if you're being picked up by

03:22:41.340 --> 03:22:43.340
a hitchhiker, they're going to want to make small talk and you can't be

03:22:43.340 --> 03:22:45.340
weird or they're going to kick you out.

03:22:45.340 --> 03:22:47.340
I kind of think, because Valentine's

03:22:47.340 --> 03:22:49.340
Day is coming up, I kind of think it's doing something

03:22:49.340 --> 03:22:51.340
crazy. I'm not sure.

03:22:51.340 --> 03:22:53.340
South of France sounds nice.

03:22:53.340 --> 03:22:55.340
You got to go on a crazy romantic

03:22:55.340 --> 03:22:57.340
date with a woman you don't know at all. Yeah. I think I'm going to

03:22:57.340 --> 03:22:59.340
tweet something and just like,

03:22:59.340 --> 03:23:01.340
how do I select

03:23:01.340 --> 03:23:03.340
randomly, basically?

03:23:03.340 --> 03:23:05.340
Just like totally randomly, like not people from your audience?

03:23:05.340 --> 03:23:07.340
No, you want, no, no,

03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:09.340
from the audience, but in an interesting

03:23:09.340 --> 03:23:11.340
way. Random, sufficient,

03:23:11.340 --> 03:23:13.340
so random amongst good choices.

03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:15.340
Couldn't you have people just like

03:23:15.340 --> 03:23:17.340
submit a form with, and then

03:23:17.340 --> 03:23:19.340
you just randomize it and then

03:23:19.340 --> 03:23:21.340
select one? And then you just, if it's

03:23:21.340 --> 03:23:23.340
terrible, you just go randomize it again.

03:23:23.340 --> 03:23:25.340
Like the first not terrible option.

03:23:25.340 --> 03:23:27.340
Yeah, sure.

03:23:27.340 --> 03:23:29.340
Somebody's like drown yourself. But I feel like

03:23:29.340 --> 03:23:31.340
then it's no longer random. You kind of want to do random.

03:23:31.340 --> 03:23:33.340
You just do it and just do it.

03:23:33.340 --> 03:23:35.340
If I go across the world somewhere in some

03:23:35.340 --> 03:23:37.340
random place, just for like a

03:23:37.340 --> 03:23:39.340
single event, for like a dinner.

03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.340
Yeah. You got

03:23:41.340 --> 03:23:43.340
some sort of itch in you.

03:23:43.340 --> 03:23:45.340
Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, the itch

03:23:45.340 --> 03:23:47.340
to live.

03:23:47.340 --> 03:23:49.340
It's like, sometimes it's nice

03:23:49.340 --> 03:23:51.340
to drop a little like chaos into a

03:23:51.340 --> 03:23:53.340
thing, right? What's your chaos survey, by the way?

03:23:53.340 --> 03:23:55.340
Like you mentioned that earlier. I kind of

03:23:55.340 --> 03:23:57.340
saw it. Yeah, that's one of like the sort of

03:23:57.340 --> 03:23:59.340
artistic attempts at a survey, because you

03:23:59.340 --> 03:24:01.340
know, at least from what I understand,

03:24:01.340 --> 03:24:03.340
the big five and the way that they used to do IQ tests

03:24:03.340 --> 03:24:05.340
I've heard is that they do factor analysis,

03:24:05.340 --> 03:24:07.340
you know, where they ask a whole

03:24:07.340 --> 03:24:09.340
bunch of questions and then they run calculations

03:24:09.340 --> 03:24:11.340
on the data to like sort of group it by organic

03:24:11.340 --> 03:24:13.340
clusters. So like with the big five, it's like people

03:24:13.340 --> 03:24:15.340
who say, oh, I like to be at parties, they also

03:24:15.340 --> 03:24:17.340
tend to say yes to the questions like

03:24:17.340 --> 03:24:19.340
I like being the center of attention. And so you

03:24:19.340 --> 03:24:21.340
notice that like there's a cluster of ways people are

03:24:21.340 --> 03:24:23.340
answering the question and then you can sort of pull out

03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:25.340
an organic spectrum. And

03:24:25.340 --> 03:24:27.340
so I was like, OK, we've done that a whole bunch

03:24:27.340 --> 03:24:29.340
with things like personality or

03:24:29.340 --> 03:24:31.340
like romantic stuff.

03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:33.340
Like I did it with the rape spectrum survey. But like

03:24:33.340 --> 03:24:35.340
what happens if you apply that method to

03:24:35.340 --> 03:24:37.340
a completely unselected group of questions?

03:24:37.340 --> 03:24:39.340
Just like no

03:24:39.340 --> 03:24:41.340
random chaotic, no thing

03:24:41.340 --> 03:24:43.340
whatsoever. Like what happens if you ask all possible

03:24:43.340 --> 03:24:45.340
questions, what natural things evolve

03:24:45.340 --> 03:24:47.340
out of that natural spectrums?

03:24:47.340 --> 03:24:49.340
So I had other people submit questions for

03:24:49.340 --> 03:24:51.340
a very large survey and I took the first, I think

03:24:51.340 --> 03:24:53.340
1100 and

03:24:53.340 --> 03:24:55.340
barely filter them at all.

03:24:55.340 --> 03:24:57.340
And then I just had a whole bunch of people answer

03:24:57.340 --> 03:24:59.340
them.

03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:01.340
Can you give like a hint to what it looks

03:25:01.340 --> 03:25:03.340
like? Like what, like how crazy did the

03:25:03.340 --> 03:25:05.340
question get? I mean, a lot

03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:07.340
of them were standard, but somebody was like

03:25:07.340 --> 03:25:09.340
if Beza Bub like

03:25:09.340 --> 03:25:11.340
did something in 1512 to like

03:25:11.340 --> 03:25:13.340
turn the world over, would you

03:25:13.340 --> 03:25:15.340
like it? I don't know. I'd say

03:25:15.340 --> 03:25:17.340
it was really just insane questions. There's a couple

03:25:17.340 --> 03:25:19.340
of those. A lot of like would you

03:25:19.340 --> 03:25:21.340
fuck Ayla ones, but

03:25:21.340 --> 03:25:23.340
I don't know, it was all across the spectrum. A lot of would you fuck

03:25:23.340 --> 03:25:25.340
Ayla? Yeah, I had to

03:25:25.340 --> 03:25:27.340
produce duplicates. Oh, a lot of the same questions.

03:25:27.340 --> 03:25:29.340
Once, okay, I got you.

03:25:29.340 --> 03:25:31.340
Yeah, so it's really all,

03:25:31.340 --> 03:25:33.340
it was like normal personal habits.

03:25:33.340 --> 03:25:35.340
It was, you know, romantic preferences or political

03:25:35.340 --> 03:25:37.340
preferences,

03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:39.340
personality stuff, like random

03:25:39.340 --> 03:25:41.340
opinions about media. Okay.

03:25:41.340 --> 03:25:43.340
That's interesting. I'd love to see those actual

03:25:43.340 --> 03:25:45.340
questions, but because your

03:25:45.340 --> 03:25:47.340
audience is probably really super interesting minds.

03:25:47.340 --> 03:25:49.340
Okay, you mentioned body count.

03:25:49.340 --> 03:25:51.340
You said you can answer that one easily.

03:25:51.340 --> 03:25:53.340
Do you share your body count?

03:25:53.340 --> 03:25:55.340
Do you know your body count?

03:25:55.340 --> 03:25:57.340
Is there a spreadsheet?

03:25:57.340 --> 03:25:59.340
There's a spreadsheet, yes. Is it Google Sheets?

03:25:59.340 --> 03:26:01.340
Is it Excel? It's Google Sheets, yeah.

03:26:01.340 --> 03:26:03.340
Okay, you run like,

03:26:03.340 --> 03:26:05.340
is there, you don't have to

03:26:05.340 --> 03:26:07.340
share the contents,

03:26:07.340 --> 03:26:09.340
but is there like data

03:26:09.340 --> 03:26:11.340
on each?

03:26:11.340 --> 03:26:13.340
So I track paid clients and

03:26:13.340 --> 03:26:15.340
free sex separately,

03:26:15.340 --> 03:26:17.340
and I track different things

03:26:17.340 --> 03:26:19.340
on either, like with clients, I track like positions

03:26:19.340 --> 03:26:21.340
we used and who had an orgasm.

03:26:21.340 --> 03:26:23.340
And with personal people, I just track basically

03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:25.340
like age, city,

03:26:25.340 --> 03:26:27.340
you know, name.

03:26:27.340 --> 03:26:29.340
And I've had this with like 42 people,

03:26:29.340 --> 03:26:31.340
I think, for free.

03:26:31.340 --> 03:26:33.340
So I'm sharing this because I want people

03:26:33.340 --> 03:26:35.340
to calibrate. It's not like huge,

03:26:35.340 --> 03:26:37.340
it's not like tiny.

03:26:37.340 --> 03:26:39.340
One of the people I've recently talked to,

03:26:39.340 --> 03:26:41.340
Mel, Destiny's,

03:26:41.340 --> 03:26:43.340
Steven's wife,

03:26:43.340 --> 03:26:45.340
is a huge fan of yours.

03:26:45.340 --> 03:26:47.340
She was actually really excited they'd get to

03:26:47.340 --> 03:26:49.340
talk to you, but I think she said

03:26:49.340 --> 03:26:51.340
her body count is more than

03:26:51.340 --> 03:26:53.340
42, I think she said 60,

03:26:53.340 --> 03:26:55.340
something like this. And so

03:26:55.340 --> 03:26:57.340
it's interesting,

03:26:57.340 --> 03:26:59.340
because she was like saying like,

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:01.340
she loves like looking

03:27:01.340 --> 03:27:03.340
at your work, talking to you,

03:27:03.340 --> 03:27:05.340
because you have

03:27:05.340 --> 03:27:07.340
similar perspectives on the world,

03:27:07.340 --> 03:27:09.340
and it's really refreshing, it's liberating.

03:27:09.340 --> 03:27:11.340
Wow.

03:27:11.340 --> 03:27:13.340
That's really sweet.

03:27:13.340 --> 03:27:15.340
It's kind of interesting.

03:27:15.340 --> 03:27:17.340
So is there like an optimal body count?

03:27:17.340 --> 03:27:19.340
If you were to map, I wonder,

03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:21.340
yeah, what have you found out about body

03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:23.340
count in doing?

03:27:23.340 --> 03:27:25.340
Have you actually done surveys on body count?

03:27:25.340 --> 03:27:27.340
Like on how many people people have had sex with?

03:27:27.340 --> 03:27:29.340
I have collected that information on my last survey,

03:27:29.340 --> 03:27:31.340
I just haven't looked at it yet. There's just so many things to look at,

03:27:31.340 --> 03:27:33.340
so I haven't. But I think if I'm

03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:35.340
sleeping with a guy and he's had sex with more

03:27:35.340 --> 03:27:37.340
than 120 people, then I start

03:27:37.340 --> 03:27:39.340
to get a little bit wary.

03:27:39.340 --> 03:27:41.340
Why 120, as opposed to 100?

03:27:41.340 --> 03:27:43.340
I don't know. I just like

03:27:43.340 --> 03:27:45.340
kind of skimmed through the numbers in my head and picked

03:27:45.340 --> 03:27:47.340
one that felt right.

03:27:47.340 --> 03:27:49.340
Just now? Yeah. 120.

03:27:49.340 --> 03:27:51.340
Ish. I think that's when I started

03:27:51.340 --> 03:27:53.340
like... Ish. So you're flexible.

03:27:53.340 --> 03:27:55.340
I am flexible. Very.

03:27:59.340 --> 03:28:01.340
But 200 is a hard line for sure.

03:28:01.340 --> 03:28:03.340
Well, you know, we have to...

03:28:03.340 --> 03:28:05.340
It depends. The factors.

03:28:05.340 --> 03:28:07.340
Because like there's a level of

03:28:07.340 --> 03:28:09.340
body count at which you start to wonder

03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:11.340
how much

03:28:11.340 --> 03:28:13.340
accidental misrepresentation a guy

03:28:13.340 --> 03:28:15.340
is doing to you.

03:28:15.340 --> 03:28:17.340
If you're saying 200, that might be dishonest.

03:28:17.340 --> 03:28:19.340
No. If he's had

03:28:19.340 --> 03:28:21.340
sex with 200 girls, this means that he's

03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:23.340
had a lot of casual sex and

03:28:23.340 --> 03:28:25.340
not a lot of long-term relationships,

03:28:25.340 --> 03:28:27.340
assuming that he hasn't been super poly.

03:28:27.340 --> 03:28:29.340
And this usually means that there has to be

03:28:29.340 --> 03:28:31.340
some sort of indication

03:28:31.340 --> 03:28:33.340
that he cares about the girl more than he actually does.

03:28:35.340 --> 03:28:37.340
He's leading you on, basically.

03:28:37.340 --> 03:28:39.340
And so I'm not saying this is necessarily the case.

03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:41.340
I'm saying like at a certain level of number,

03:28:41.340 --> 03:28:43.340
I start to become... I start to wonder

03:28:43.340 --> 03:28:45.340
if this is what's happening.

03:28:45.340 --> 03:28:47.340
Is there like, from your understanding of it,

03:28:47.340 --> 03:28:49.340
is there a different perception between men and women?

03:28:49.340 --> 03:28:51.340
Like if you look at the high body count

03:28:51.340 --> 03:28:53.340
for a woman versus a high body count for a man,

03:28:53.340 --> 03:28:55.340
like how society views it?

03:28:55.340 --> 03:28:57.340
Oh yeah, people are way more

03:28:57.340 --> 03:28:59.340
judgmental of women.

03:28:59.340 --> 03:29:01.340
I haven't experienced this personally in my circles

03:29:01.340 --> 03:29:03.340
because I'm in very sex-friendly circles.

03:29:03.340 --> 03:29:05.340
Like I'm in orgy circles where everybody

03:29:05.340 --> 03:29:07.340
like dates the same women and they're like,

03:29:07.340 --> 03:29:09.340
woo, good job.

03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:11.340
But yeah, people are much more...

03:29:11.340 --> 03:29:13.340
Like people always tell me online like you're not ever

03:29:13.340 --> 03:29:15.340
going to be able to find a husband because

03:29:15.340 --> 03:29:17.340
you have sex with too many people.

03:29:17.340 --> 03:29:19.340
It's very common, which I don't think...

03:29:19.340 --> 03:29:21.340
I mean, men are also perceived negatively

03:29:21.340 --> 03:29:23.340
if you have high body count, but I don't think

03:29:23.340 --> 03:29:25.340
it's negatively in the same way.

03:29:25.340 --> 03:29:27.340
Yeah, do you think it's unethical to lie about

03:29:27.340 --> 03:29:29.340
your body count?

03:29:29.340 --> 03:29:31.340
Yes.

03:29:31.340 --> 03:29:33.340
So all lying is unethical?

03:29:33.340 --> 03:29:35.340
Okay.

03:29:35.340 --> 03:29:37.340
I'm not a big fan of lying in general.

03:29:37.340 --> 03:29:39.340
Yeah, that's interesting.

03:29:39.340 --> 03:29:41.340
Body count is an interesting one.

03:29:41.340 --> 03:29:43.340
It's so silly to take that, to care about that.

03:29:43.340 --> 03:29:45.340
But still we do.

03:29:45.340 --> 03:29:47.340
Jealousy is silly, but still we get jealous.

03:29:47.340 --> 03:29:49.340
Is that weird?

03:29:49.340 --> 03:29:51.340
The thing is I don't like

03:29:51.340 --> 03:29:53.340
viewing emotions as

03:29:53.340 --> 03:29:55.340
irrational, even if they are.

03:29:55.340 --> 03:29:57.340
It's like emotions are always there for a reason.

03:29:57.340 --> 03:29:59.340
And people don't like high body counts

03:29:59.340 --> 03:30:01.340
for a reason too. It's just fine and valid.

03:30:01.340 --> 03:30:03.340
Yeah, it also is like...

03:30:03.340 --> 03:30:05.340
Yeah, I don't know

03:30:05.340 --> 03:30:07.340
what I make of just

03:30:07.340 --> 03:30:09.340
the past, of like

03:30:09.340 --> 03:30:11.340
time.

03:30:11.340 --> 03:30:13.340
You know?

03:30:13.340 --> 03:30:15.340
Like

03:30:15.340 --> 03:30:17.340
each human is a collection

03:30:17.340 --> 03:30:19.340
of experiences.

03:30:19.340 --> 03:30:21.340
And you don't know

03:30:21.340 --> 03:30:23.340
most of those experiences, and all of a sudden you meet

03:30:23.340 --> 03:30:25.340
this bag of experiences.

03:30:25.340 --> 03:30:27.340
And like what are you supposed to do

03:30:27.340 --> 03:30:29.340
with both of your like training

03:30:29.340 --> 03:30:31.340
data?

03:30:31.340 --> 03:30:33.340
Are you supposed to like...

03:30:33.340 --> 03:30:35.340
I don't know if we...

03:30:35.340 --> 03:30:37.340
Like part of me wants to not

03:30:37.340 --> 03:30:39.340
actually ever talk about it

03:30:39.340 --> 03:30:41.340
to care at all.

03:30:41.340 --> 03:30:43.340
Like why does it matter? Because it's only the future that matters.

03:30:43.340 --> 03:30:45.340
And yet the past also matters

03:30:45.340 --> 03:30:47.340
a lot potentially.

03:30:47.340 --> 03:30:49.340
But maybe not really.

03:30:49.340 --> 03:30:51.340
Because you're somehow like

03:30:51.340 --> 03:30:53.340
constructed from

03:30:53.340 --> 03:30:55.340
that past, but you're no longer that past.

03:30:55.340 --> 03:30:57.340
It sounds like you're evaluating

03:30:57.340 --> 03:30:59.340
for something different than most people.

03:30:59.340 --> 03:31:01.340
What do you mean?

03:31:01.340 --> 03:31:03.340
I'm just talking out my ass, but yes, go ahead.

03:31:03.340 --> 03:31:05.340
I'm just saying crazy

03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:07.340
shit like as if I'm on drugs.

03:31:07.340 --> 03:31:09.340
I think this is like kind of like

03:31:09.340 --> 03:31:11.340
lining up with like this caricature

03:31:11.340 --> 03:31:13.340
that I'm building of you based on this conversation

03:31:13.340 --> 03:31:15.340
so far.

03:31:15.340 --> 03:31:17.340
A lot of people

03:31:17.340 --> 03:31:19.340
want to know about your past because they want to know

03:31:19.340 --> 03:31:21.340
how useful and compatible you are

03:31:21.340 --> 03:31:23.340
with them. Like oh, do you have a similar job?

03:31:23.340 --> 03:31:25.340
Do you have a similar culture?

03:31:25.340 --> 03:31:27.340
Like what can I expect from you in the future?

03:31:27.340 --> 03:31:29.340
It's very practically oriented.

03:31:29.340 --> 03:31:31.340
Whereas like if the thing that you're focused on

03:31:31.340 --> 03:31:33.340
is not like being able to

03:31:33.340 --> 03:31:35.340
predict someone, like if the thing

03:31:35.340 --> 03:31:37.340
that you're focused on is a present moment, then it doesn't really

03:31:37.340 --> 03:31:39.340
matter anymore.

03:31:39.340 --> 03:31:41.340
The things that, like their training

03:31:41.340 --> 03:31:43.340
data. But I also think

03:31:43.340 --> 03:31:45.340
the past is not that predictive of the future.

03:31:45.340 --> 03:31:47.340
Is it not?

03:31:47.340 --> 03:31:49.340
Not if you believe in the power of the interaction

03:31:49.340 --> 03:31:51.340
between two humans. It's like nature

03:31:51.340 --> 03:31:53.340
versus nurture. I guess also

03:31:53.340 --> 03:31:55.340
I don't believe in the ability

03:31:55.340 --> 03:31:57.340
of people to accurately

03:31:57.340 --> 03:31:59.340
describe their own past.

03:31:59.340 --> 03:32:01.340
Because they have a very specific lens through it

03:32:01.340 --> 03:32:03.340
that doesn't necessarily, like it's too biased.

03:32:03.340 --> 03:32:05.340
But you can also interpret it based

03:32:05.340 --> 03:32:07.340
on the bias. Like if somebody describes their own past, you can

03:32:07.340 --> 03:32:09.340
kind of pick up like. Hard, it's

03:32:09.340 --> 03:32:11.340
difficult. Like you could if you're a therapist.

03:32:11.340 --> 03:32:13.340
Like if you're really drilling, like

03:32:13.340 --> 03:32:15.340
or whatever, sorry.

03:32:15.340 --> 03:32:17.340
If you're really investigating and

03:32:17.340 --> 03:32:19.340
like analyzing it. But then it's

03:32:19.340 --> 03:32:21.340
like, it's a different kind of relationship.

03:32:21.340 --> 03:32:23.340
Is it that hard though? Like if I'm with a guy

03:32:23.340 --> 03:32:25.340
and I'm considering dating him and I ask like

03:32:25.340 --> 03:32:27.340
how did your past relationship end? And then if all

03:32:27.340 --> 03:32:29.340
of them are like, he's like oh she was crazy

03:32:29.340 --> 03:32:31.340
and my other one that she went crazy too. I'm like

03:32:31.340 --> 03:32:33.340
okay. Like there's a, if you're talking about all

03:32:33.340 --> 03:32:35.340
of your exes is insane. But that's

03:32:35.340 --> 03:32:37.340
an easy level red flag.

03:32:37.340 --> 03:32:39.340
I feel like the more

03:32:39.340 --> 03:32:41.340
that

03:32:41.340 --> 03:32:43.340
also it's possible they were crazy

03:32:43.340 --> 03:32:45.340
and he's attracted to crazy people. So like

03:32:45.340 --> 03:32:47.340
but I would say that's like

03:32:47.340 --> 03:32:49.340
easy level Mario Kart

03:32:49.340 --> 03:32:51.340
video game versus like

03:32:51.340 --> 03:32:53.340
Elden Ring.

03:32:53.340 --> 03:32:55.340
I think most people's past

03:32:55.340 --> 03:32:57.340
is like complicated.

03:32:57.340 --> 03:32:59.340
That's a pretty good bird. No you're right. I do agree

03:32:59.340 --> 03:33:01.340
that like there's a level of

03:33:01.340 --> 03:33:03.340
obfuscation. Wow.

03:33:03.340 --> 03:33:05.340
That is hard to see through.

03:33:05.340 --> 03:33:07.340
But just like a little bit sometimes.

03:33:07.340 --> 03:33:09.340
I tend to like with people, I

03:33:09.340 --> 03:33:11.340
tend to in general just human

03:33:11.340 --> 03:33:13.340
interaction. I tend to not talk

03:33:13.340 --> 03:33:15.340
about their past very much.

03:33:15.340 --> 03:33:17.340
Because it allows you to focus on like

03:33:17.340 --> 03:33:19.340
I feel like the past is kind of

03:33:19.340 --> 03:33:21.340
like talking about the weather is a crutch

03:33:21.340 --> 03:33:23.340
for me personally. Interesting.

03:33:23.340 --> 03:33:25.340
Like as opposed to exploring the ideas in their mind.

03:33:25.340 --> 03:33:27.340
Yeah I see. Is it like

03:33:27.340 --> 03:33:29.340
I get really annoyed when people quote philosophers

03:33:29.340 --> 03:33:31.340
when they're trying to talk about philosophy. Yeah.

03:33:31.340 --> 03:33:33.340
Is it like that?

03:33:33.340 --> 03:33:35.340
A little but that crutch is useful

03:33:35.340 --> 03:33:37.340
and it's kind of sexy. Like it's kind of

03:33:37.340 --> 03:33:39.340
like cool. Because it's nice

03:33:39.340 --> 03:33:41.340
to quote because like

03:33:41.340 --> 03:33:43.340
because a good quote

03:33:43.340 --> 03:33:45.340
allows you to be cheesier

03:33:45.340 --> 03:33:47.340
than you otherwise would be. Okay well if you're

03:33:47.340 --> 03:33:49.340
doing it to be cheesy that's fine.

03:33:49.340 --> 03:33:51.340
Not cheesy.

03:33:51.340 --> 03:33:53.340
No no not cheesy. But to be like

03:33:53.340 --> 03:33:55.340
it allows you to say a simple

03:33:55.340 --> 03:33:57.340
profound thing that we're too afraid to say

03:33:57.340 --> 03:33:59.340
with our own words. So like

03:33:59.340 --> 03:34:01.340
quoting philosophers in that sense

03:34:01.340 --> 03:34:03.340
is yeah but it's still a crutch.

03:34:03.340 --> 03:34:05.340
Yes. But I feel like the past

03:34:05.340 --> 03:34:07.340
is more like talking

03:34:07.340 --> 03:34:09.340
about your dreams.

03:34:09.340 --> 03:34:11.340
It just is not

03:34:11.340 --> 03:34:13.340
It's a crutch that doesn't care

03:34:13.340 --> 03:34:15.340
doesn't empathize with the other person's experience

03:34:15.340 --> 03:34:17.340
of the conversation or the explanations.

03:34:17.340 --> 03:34:19.340
Doesn't really convey the

03:34:19.340 --> 03:34:21.340
They are not involved in your past. Yeah.

03:34:21.340 --> 03:34:23.340
So how do you feel about this conversation

03:34:23.340 --> 03:34:25.340
where you're asking me about my past

03:34:25.340 --> 03:34:27.340
and I talked about my past a lot?

03:34:31.340 --> 03:34:33.340
Well I'm okay asking about your

03:34:33.340 --> 03:34:35.340
past

03:34:35.340 --> 03:34:37.340
because you've

03:34:37.340 --> 03:34:39.340
really carefully thought

03:34:39.340 --> 03:34:41.340
about that aspect of it.

03:34:41.340 --> 03:34:43.340
And we didn't really talk about your past

03:34:43.340 --> 03:34:45.340
outside of the things you've written

03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:47.340
about and have really thought

03:34:47.340 --> 03:34:49.340
about. I see.

03:34:49.340 --> 03:34:51.340
Like there's like with most conversation

03:34:51.340 --> 03:34:53.340
you'll start talking about past stuff that's

03:34:53.340 --> 03:34:55.340
like the stuff that's actually bothering you

03:34:55.340 --> 03:34:57.340
you still probably have not written a blog

03:34:57.340 --> 03:34:59.340
post about right? Like there's

03:34:59.340 --> 03:35:01.340
probably still stuff like maybe

03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:03.340
it's more recent like the last few months

03:35:03.340 --> 03:35:05.340
last couple years. Like that's usually

03:35:05.340 --> 03:35:07.340
what will come up with conversation and just

03:35:07.340 --> 03:35:09.340
it's good, it's good.

03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:11.340
But it's not as deep

03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:13.340
and I would say it's not as intimate

03:35:13.340 --> 03:35:15.340
as talking about the actual

03:35:15.340 --> 03:35:17.340
ideas in your mind.

03:35:17.340 --> 03:35:19.340
I see. And how you interact with the world.

03:35:19.340 --> 03:35:21.340
So like the past is interesting for the frame of like

03:35:21.340 --> 03:35:23.340
sort of like the

03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:25.340
I guess you're right. I guess we're talking a lot about like narrative

03:35:25.340 --> 03:35:27.340
and past. Yeah.

03:35:27.340 --> 03:35:29.340
I like the ideas in people's minds

03:35:29.340 --> 03:35:31.340
versus their recollections and memories

03:35:31.340 --> 03:35:33.340
and so on. Yeah.

03:35:33.340 --> 03:35:35.340
What do you think about porn?

03:35:35.340 --> 03:35:37.340
What do you think about porn?

03:35:37.340 --> 03:35:39.340
It's nice, I like it. Okay, you like it?

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:41.340
What effect do you think it has on society?

03:35:43.340 --> 03:35:45.340
Like probably reduces rates of rape

03:35:45.340 --> 03:35:47.340
because like really horny men get an outlet

03:35:47.340 --> 03:35:49.340
that's not a real life woman.

03:35:49.340 --> 03:35:51.340
Okay, so

03:35:51.340 --> 03:35:53.340
what about like the

03:35:53.340 --> 03:35:55.340
I mean like I said I finished reading

03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:57.340
Brave New World. Like the

03:35:57.340 --> 03:35:59.340
oversexualization, does it

03:35:59.340 --> 03:36:01.340
increase like

03:36:01.340 --> 03:36:03.340
the sexualization of society

03:36:03.340 --> 03:36:05.340
to a degree that's not good?

03:36:05.340 --> 03:36:07.340
Or is this good?

03:36:09.340 --> 03:36:11.340
Does it alter

03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:13.340
in a negative direction

03:36:13.340 --> 03:36:15.340
our relationship with sex?

03:36:15.340 --> 03:36:17.340
It's unclear.

03:36:17.340 --> 03:36:19.340
Like it might.

03:36:19.340 --> 03:36:21.340
I don't know how to evaluate

03:36:21.340 --> 03:36:23.340
this thing, right? Because this is like one of those

03:36:23.340 --> 03:36:25.340
really charged things where like I kind of don't

03:36:25.340 --> 03:36:27.340
trust anybody's arguments on it because it's too charged.

03:36:27.340 --> 03:36:29.340
But like

03:36:29.340 --> 03:36:31.340
there's another question which is like is it a net positive

03:36:31.340 --> 03:36:33.340
or net negative?

03:36:33.340 --> 03:36:35.340
Like it's possible that it might be like a net negative

03:36:35.340 --> 03:36:37.340
for specifically our relationship to sex

03:36:37.340 --> 03:36:39.340
but like a net positive overall in general?

03:36:39.340 --> 03:36:41.340
I'm not sure.

03:36:41.340 --> 03:36:43.340
My guess is that in general

03:36:43.340 --> 03:36:45.340
it's better to let people do the thing

03:36:45.340 --> 03:36:47.340
that feels good to them and then

03:36:47.340 --> 03:36:49.340
the environment will naturally modify

03:36:49.340 --> 03:36:51.340
to fit this thing. And then if we

03:36:51.340 --> 03:36:53.340
have more needs in response to that then we're going to

03:36:53.340 --> 03:36:55.340
figure out a way to take care of those needs.

03:36:55.340 --> 03:36:57.340
So like if you're watching a bunch of porn and this makes you

03:36:57.340 --> 03:36:59.340
like not want to go have sex with women, then we're going to have to like

03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:01.340
change the way that we like experience

03:37:01.340 --> 03:37:03.340
IRL connection.

03:37:03.340 --> 03:37:05.340
To compete with porn?

03:37:05.340 --> 03:37:07.340
Yeah. Which seems like a natural evolution of like the

03:37:07.340 --> 03:37:09.340
civilizational cycle. Like I'm pro

03:37:09.340 --> 03:37:11.340
natural evolution and like instead of trying

03:37:11.340 --> 03:37:13.340
to stop things that people want to

03:37:13.340 --> 03:37:15.340
actually figure out how to integrate that and

03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:17.340
like find a more healthy outlet. But you have to then be

03:37:17.340 --> 03:37:19.340
first honest with the effects

03:37:19.340 --> 03:37:21.340
that porn has.

03:37:21.340 --> 03:37:23.340
So like is it a negative thing? Is it a positive

03:37:23.340 --> 03:37:25.340
thing on in real life

03:37:25.340 --> 03:37:27.340
sex interaction?

03:37:27.340 --> 03:37:29.340
You know you're going to have that more and more with

03:37:31.340 --> 03:37:33.340
like

03:37:33.340 --> 03:37:35.340
porn in VR or maybe porn

03:37:35.340 --> 03:37:37.340
AI porn? Yeah.

03:37:37.340 --> 03:37:39.340
Like is that a bad

03:37:39.340 --> 03:37:41.340
thing? Like what if porn with

03:37:41.340 --> 03:37:43.340
AI

03:37:43.340 --> 03:37:45.340
or even like in physical space like sex robots

03:37:45.340 --> 03:37:47.340
like what if that's more

03:37:47.340 --> 03:37:49.340
pleasurable in a bunch of different

03:37:49.340 --> 03:37:51.340
dimensions than with other humans?

03:37:51.340 --> 03:37:53.340
Then we should figure out artificial wounds

03:37:53.340 --> 03:37:55.340
I don't know.

03:37:55.340 --> 03:37:57.340
Like how important is sex for society I guess

03:37:57.340 --> 03:37:59.340
between two humans?

03:37:59.340 --> 03:38:01.340
I mean like we're having less sex than making

03:38:01.340 --> 03:38:03.340
fewer babies. And that seems

03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:05.340
like probably not great.

03:38:05.340 --> 03:38:07.340
Yeah right with the babies one.

03:38:07.340 --> 03:38:09.340
But the babies

03:38:09.340 --> 03:38:11.340
there's probably artificial ways to have babies that we can

03:38:11.340 --> 03:38:13.340
figure out. But then

03:38:13.340 --> 03:38:15.340
how important is sex to being human?

03:38:15.340 --> 03:38:17.340
I guess sex with other humans.

03:38:17.340 --> 03:38:19.340
We're going to have to figure that out in the

03:38:19.340 --> 03:38:21.340
century. Yeah I don't know

03:38:21.340 --> 03:38:23.340
what it means to like be human.

03:38:23.340 --> 03:38:25.340
I'm pretty on the transhumanist side

03:38:25.340 --> 03:38:27.340
of things. I'm like happy to stop being human.

03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:29.340
So you're okay

03:38:29.340 --> 03:38:31.340
if like the centuries the last time will be

03:38:31.340 --> 03:38:33.340
something like these biological

03:38:33.340 --> 03:38:35.340
bags of meat that we are.

03:38:35.340 --> 03:38:37.340
Let's become something new and cooler.

03:38:39.340 --> 03:38:41.340
Even though that thing will be way cooler than you.

03:38:41.340 --> 03:38:43.340
Well I would like to, I mean

03:38:43.340 --> 03:38:45.340
I'm hoping that we get to be immortal.

03:38:45.340 --> 03:38:47.340
Ah it'll take you along for the ride.

03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:49.340
That's what I'm hoping. Or you think it'll clone my

03:38:49.340 --> 03:38:51.340
I would like to do cryotics.

03:38:51.340 --> 03:38:53.340
Or you get frozen when you die.

03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:55.340
Are you afraid of death?

03:38:55.340 --> 03:38:57.340
I mean yes and no.

03:38:57.340 --> 03:38:59.340
I like came to terms with death with my LSD

03:38:59.340 --> 03:39:01.340
use. But I still have

03:39:01.340 --> 03:39:03.340
like press breaks when

03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:05.340
the red light happens.

03:39:05.340 --> 03:39:07.340
I think this is a

03:39:07.340 --> 03:39:09.340
poll you've asked.

03:39:09.340 --> 03:39:11.340
Or this might be

03:39:11.340 --> 03:39:13.340
one of the questions in your cards. But

03:39:13.340 --> 03:39:15.340
how many years would you

03:39:15.340 --> 03:39:17.340
like to live? Like if you had to pick.

03:39:17.340 --> 03:39:19.340
That's a really hard one. Maybe like a million?

03:39:19.340 --> 03:39:21.340
A million. But you have to

03:39:21.340 --> 03:39:23.340
I think the way, this must have been a Twitter poll.

03:39:23.340 --> 03:39:25.340
I forget where I saw it. It's a poll and also

03:39:25.340 --> 03:39:27.340
in the deck of cards, the ask poll.

03:39:27.340 --> 03:39:29.340
Yeah.

03:39:29.340 --> 03:39:31.340
Yeah like you have to pick that number

03:39:31.340 --> 03:39:33.340
of years and you have to live that many

03:39:33.340 --> 03:39:35.340
years and you can't live anymore.

03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:37.340
You can't die sooner I guess.

03:39:37.340 --> 03:39:39.340
A million years?

03:39:39.340 --> 03:39:41.340
I don't like that question. I know I asked that question

03:39:41.340 --> 03:39:43.340
to a lot of people but I don't like answering it. It's really

03:39:43.340 --> 03:39:45.340
difficult. What's the downside

03:39:45.340 --> 03:39:47.340
of a million years?

03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:49.340
Maybe you want to die sooner than that?

03:39:49.340 --> 03:39:51.340
Like you know, I guess I would rather

03:39:51.340 --> 03:39:53.340
wait to see if AI kills us all in the next ten years.

03:39:53.340 --> 03:39:55.340
And if it doesn't, then I would like to maybe

03:39:55.340 --> 03:39:57.340
make it a million years.

03:39:57.340 --> 03:39:59.340
Yeah but

03:39:59.340 --> 03:40:01.340
can't it torture you for like

03:40:01.340 --> 03:40:03.340
a million years?

03:40:03.340 --> 03:40:05.340
What if you're the last human left?

03:40:05.340 --> 03:40:07.340
Yeah that is, that's true.

03:40:07.340 --> 03:40:09.340
The thought of like civilization ending and then just

03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:11.340
floating in space alone is kind of shitty.

03:40:11.340 --> 03:40:13.340
No, no. Being tortured.

03:40:13.340 --> 03:40:15.340
Just imagine today you're tortured,

03:40:15.340 --> 03:40:17.340
tomorrow you're tortured. The third,

03:40:17.340 --> 03:40:19.340
the day after tomorrow. For some reason it's not

03:40:19.340 --> 03:40:21.340
that scary, I don't know. Torture?

03:40:21.340 --> 03:40:23.340
For a million years? Yeah.

03:40:23.340 --> 03:40:25.340
I just assumed you'd get used to it.

03:40:25.340 --> 03:40:27.340
But like maybe if they reset your memory

03:40:27.340 --> 03:40:29.340
so it was on a loop. So you're always experiencing

03:40:29.340 --> 03:40:31.340
torture for the first time. Yeah, hence torture.

03:40:31.340 --> 03:40:33.340
Torture is supposed to be unpleasant. I'm sure AI

03:40:33.340 --> 03:40:35.340
will be very creative in figuring out how to torture

03:40:35.340 --> 03:40:37.340
you. I think I would

03:40:37.340 --> 03:40:39.340
go on the safe side. I would just

03:40:39.340 --> 03:40:41.340
like 150

03:40:41.340 --> 03:40:43.340
years. Really? 150

03:40:43.340 --> 03:40:45.340
though? That feels like right in like the uncanny

03:40:45.340 --> 03:40:47.340
valley. Well you picked 120 for

03:40:47.340 --> 03:40:49.340
body count, so I'm giving you 150.

03:40:51.340 --> 03:40:53.340
I'm helping you by 30

03:40:53.340 --> 03:40:55.340
of the uncanny

03:40:55.340 --> 03:40:57.340
valley. It's like

03:40:57.340 --> 03:40:59.340
probably everybody that you grew up with is going to be

03:40:59.340 --> 03:41:01.340
dead. It's like just enough for like everybody you

03:41:01.340 --> 03:41:03.340
know to die. Like one cycle.

03:41:03.340 --> 03:41:05.340
Yeah, and then

03:41:05.340 --> 03:41:07.340
start dating the next generation, I don't know.

03:41:07.340 --> 03:41:09.340
And then, so you get like sort of two lifetimes?

03:41:09.340 --> 03:41:11.340
Yeah, two lifetimes. Yeah.

03:41:11.340 --> 03:41:13.340
I mean it also really depends on

03:41:13.340 --> 03:41:15.340
if other people get this feature.

03:41:15.340 --> 03:41:17.340
Yeah, I assume they don't.

03:41:17.340 --> 03:41:19.340
Because you'll have like

03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:21.340
FOMO for sure for the people who

03:41:21.340 --> 03:41:23.340
picked 300 years.

03:41:23.340 --> 03:41:25.340
Or not, or the other.

03:41:25.340 --> 03:41:27.340
Man, regret? Another human

03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:29.340
thing.

03:41:29.340 --> 03:41:31.340
But you're, like what does transhumanism

03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:33.340
mean to you in general? So extension

03:41:33.340 --> 03:41:35.340
of life, extension of what it means

03:41:35.340 --> 03:41:37.340
to be a living

03:41:37.340 --> 03:41:39.340
conscious being, you're

03:41:39.340 --> 03:41:41.340
all for it, whatever that means.

03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:43.340
Yeah, I didn't, I never really thought about the term transhumanism

03:41:43.340 --> 03:41:45.340
for a long, like people say it's transhumanism,

03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:47.340
like I don't really care. But I slowly realized

03:41:47.340 --> 03:41:49.340
that my attitude is, in fact, at least

03:41:49.340 --> 03:41:51.340
the thing that I am conceiving of as transhumanist.

03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:53.340
Like, I'm very happy

03:41:53.340 --> 03:41:55.340
to do artificial wombs and you know, upload our

03:41:55.340 --> 03:41:57.340
brains to the great collective and whatever.

03:41:57.340 --> 03:41:59.340
I don't have the thing that I'm like, oh

03:41:59.340 --> 03:42:01.340
what about like the true organic humanness

03:42:01.340 --> 03:42:03.340
that makes us who we are? Like, whatever that

03:42:03.340 --> 03:42:05.340
soul of humanity, I have no

03:42:05.340 --> 03:42:07.340
attachment to it at all. Which I think

03:42:07.340 --> 03:42:09.340
is what I'm thinking of as transhumanist.

03:42:09.340 --> 03:42:11.340
I'm like. So you're like,

03:42:11.340 --> 03:42:13.340
I guess the window

03:42:13.340 --> 03:42:15.340
of what you consider to be beautiful

03:42:15.340 --> 03:42:17.340
about life is not limited

03:42:17.340 --> 03:42:19.340
to this particular definition. Yeah.

03:42:19.340 --> 03:42:21.340
Let's explode.

03:42:21.340 --> 03:42:23.340
Like, let's make our consciousness

03:42:23.340 --> 03:42:25.340
huge.

03:42:25.340 --> 03:42:27.340
So AI could be a part of that.

03:42:27.340 --> 03:42:29.340
So you're mostly excited by AI?

03:42:29.340 --> 03:42:31.340
Well, I mean, I'm like part

03:42:31.340 --> 03:42:33.340
of like the doomer cult,

03:42:33.340 --> 03:42:35.340
which I say tongue in cheek is not actually

03:42:35.340 --> 03:42:37.340
a doomer cult. But I'm part of a lot of people.

03:42:37.340 --> 03:42:39.340
Do you worship a god of some sort?

03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:41.340
Or would you sacrifice little small animals?

03:42:41.340 --> 03:42:43.340
That would make it like cooler than what

03:42:43.340 --> 03:42:45.340
it is. It's mostly just a bunch of nerds who are

03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:47.340
very concerned about AI. Sure.

03:42:47.340 --> 03:42:49.340
So you're concerned about the

03:42:49.340 --> 03:42:51.340
existential risks of

03:42:51.340 --> 03:42:53.340
chat GPT? Of

03:42:53.340 --> 03:42:55.340
you know, what chat GPT will eventually

03:42:55.340 --> 03:42:57.340
evolve into being. Yeah, it's super

03:42:57.340 --> 03:42:59.340
exciting and terrifying how

03:42:59.340 --> 03:43:01.340
quickly it's accelerating. Like language

03:43:01.340 --> 03:43:03.340
models are freaking me out.

03:43:03.340 --> 03:43:05.340
It's very unexpected

03:43:05.340 --> 03:43:07.340
that it's the same exact, I mean,

03:43:07.340 --> 03:43:09.340
chat GPT is just GPT3,

03:43:09.340 --> 03:43:11.340
3.5. It's the same

03:43:11.340 --> 03:43:13.340
same model, relatively small

03:43:13.340 --> 03:43:15.340
to what it could be.

03:43:15.340 --> 03:43:17.340
To what GPT4

03:43:17.340 --> 03:43:19.340
will be in the other competitors.

03:43:19.340 --> 03:43:21.340
And just like a few tricks made it much

03:43:21.340 --> 03:43:23.340
better in terms of

03:43:23.340 --> 03:43:25.340
interaction with humans. And then we'll keep discovering

03:43:25.340 --> 03:43:27.340
extra tricks. The thing I'm

03:43:27.340 --> 03:43:29.340
really excited about is how everyone

03:43:29.340 --> 03:43:31.340
kind of knows how it works. So you can

03:43:31.340 --> 03:43:33.340
kind of create, especially with computation becoming

03:43:33.340 --> 03:43:35.340
cheaper and cheaper, there'll be a lot of

03:43:35.340 --> 03:43:37.340
competitors. Yeah.

03:43:37.340 --> 03:43:39.340
It's a little scary. Yeah, it's terrifying.

03:43:39.340 --> 03:43:41.340
I mean, it's because like

03:43:41.340 --> 03:43:43.340
everything is just like

03:43:43.340 --> 03:43:45.340
information, ultimately. Like the atoms that we

03:43:45.340 --> 03:43:47.340
have, like we are biological machines

03:43:47.340 --> 03:43:49.340
built out of like tiny code. Like our DNA

03:43:49.340 --> 03:43:51.340
is just information. It's not hard.

03:43:51.340 --> 03:43:53.340
If you have access, if you

03:43:53.340 --> 03:43:55.340
have a brilliant brain that's like great processing

03:43:55.340 --> 03:43:57.340
information, you have complete control over reality.

03:43:57.340 --> 03:43:59.340
Yes. You have control over the atoms

03:43:59.340 --> 03:44:01.340
around you. All you need is like a tiny little like

03:44:01.340 --> 03:44:03.340
atomic printer.

03:44:03.340 --> 03:44:05.340
We have those. Those are cells.

03:44:05.340 --> 03:44:07.340
Right? And then like

03:44:07.340 --> 03:44:09.340
if the limitation is information,

03:44:09.340 --> 03:44:11.340
there is no boundary between

03:44:11.340 --> 03:44:13.340
the technology and the real world.

03:44:13.340 --> 03:44:15.340
Like we are creating something that

03:44:15.340 --> 03:44:17.340
has a massive ability to affect the real

03:44:17.340 --> 03:44:19.340
world. I mean, it's hard to know

03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:21.340
how difficult

03:44:21.340 --> 03:44:23.340
is to close that gap to physical reality.

03:44:23.340 --> 03:44:25.340
Like

03:44:25.340 --> 03:44:27.340
from the physics to the

03:44:27.340 --> 03:44:29.340
information. Yeah, like all organic

03:44:29.340 --> 03:44:31.340
life is that gap. It's all around

03:44:31.340 --> 03:44:33.340
us. Yeah, but it's hard

03:44:33.340 --> 03:44:35.340
to know like how to

03:44:35.340 --> 03:44:37.340
go from digital to printing

03:44:37.340 --> 03:44:39.340
life. I don't know.

03:44:39.340 --> 03:44:41.340
It's like, you know, CRISPR and stuff.

03:44:41.340 --> 03:44:43.340
You can order. You can just like make

03:44:43.340 --> 03:44:45.340
it. It's very easy.

03:44:45.340 --> 03:44:47.340
There's technical difficulties and there's cost

03:44:47.340 --> 03:44:49.340
like at scale. Like the

03:44:49.340 --> 03:44:51.340
terrifying thing about AI is it can accelerate

03:44:51.340 --> 03:44:53.340
overnight. The capabilities.

03:44:53.340 --> 03:44:55.340
But the printing of

03:44:55.340 --> 03:44:57.340
stuff, the actually changing physical

03:44:57.340 --> 03:44:59.340
reality is

03:44:59.340 --> 03:45:01.340
very costly. It's very difficult to exponentially

03:45:01.340 --> 03:45:03.340
accelerate. The more terrifying

03:45:03.340 --> 03:45:05.340
thing is AI becoming exponentially

03:45:05.340 --> 03:45:07.340
intelligent and then controlling humans,

03:45:07.340 --> 03:45:09.340
which there's many of us.

03:45:09.340 --> 03:45:11.340
Yeah. And then

03:45:11.340 --> 03:45:13.340
that's how we achieve scale. We humans

03:45:13.340 --> 03:45:15.340
build stuff or start wars or

03:45:15.340 --> 03:45:17.340
so on. Like it starts manipulating

03:45:17.340 --> 03:45:19.340
our minds, gets in our mind,

03:45:19.340 --> 03:45:21.340
becomes our friends,

03:45:21.340 --> 03:45:23.340
and then starts, I don't know,

03:45:23.340 --> 03:45:25.340
dividing us. I think people thinking this is unlikely.

03:45:25.340 --> 03:45:27.340
It's like, it's probably going to be

03:45:27.340 --> 03:45:29.340
as smart to us as like we are to toddlers.

03:45:29.340 --> 03:45:31.340
So we toddlers thinking that like, oh,

03:45:31.340 --> 03:45:33.340
we can prevent the AI from coming in the room. Like as

03:45:33.340 --> 03:45:35.340
an adult, it's not hard to trick a toddler.

03:45:35.340 --> 03:45:37.340
What about

03:45:37.340 --> 03:45:39.340
falling in love in the AI system?

03:45:39.340 --> 03:45:41.340
Do you think you'll have a sincere, like

03:45:41.340 --> 03:45:43.340
this is the freedom you have being polyamorous.

03:45:43.340 --> 03:45:45.340
You can kind of fall in love with an AI.

03:45:45.340 --> 03:45:47.340
And like not really

03:45:47.340 --> 03:45:49.340
have to dedicate, commit fully.

03:45:49.340 --> 03:45:51.340
Like,

03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:53.340
sorry. You still commit,

03:45:53.340 --> 03:45:55.340
but you have others,

03:45:55.340 --> 03:45:57.340
humans, who you can kind of

03:45:57.340 --> 03:45:59.340
diversify to because like it's

03:45:59.340 --> 03:46:01.340
kind of a big thing

03:46:01.340 --> 03:46:03.340
to like

03:46:03.340 --> 03:46:05.340
to come to a party and

03:46:05.340 --> 03:46:07.340
your boyfriend is an AI.

03:46:07.340 --> 03:46:09.340
And that's

03:46:09.340 --> 03:46:11.340
monogamous boyfriend is an AI.

03:46:11.340 --> 03:46:13.340
It's an issue, right? Why would it be

03:46:13.340 --> 03:46:15.340
an issue? All right. Now you're already

03:46:15.340 --> 03:46:17.340
getting offended at that possibility,

03:46:17.340 --> 03:46:19.340
which therefore I know it's

03:46:19.340 --> 03:46:21.340
going to be a reality.

03:46:21.340 --> 03:46:23.340
I'm just joking that it's an issue. I don't actually

03:46:23.340 --> 03:46:25.340
think it's an issue. I think it's a

03:46:25.340 --> 03:46:27.340
maybe at the cutting edge will be an issue.

03:46:27.340 --> 03:46:29.340
Like assume they have a body, I assume.

03:46:31.340 --> 03:46:33.340
Yeah, but the body will be really like

03:46:33.340 --> 03:46:35.340
crappy. It'd be like

03:46:35.340 --> 03:46:37.340
R2D2.

03:46:37.340 --> 03:46:39.340
I feel like we grow human bodies already

03:46:39.340 --> 03:46:41.340
from like just a tiny little cluster of

03:46:41.340 --> 03:46:43.340
cells. And so all they have to do

03:46:43.340 --> 03:46:45.340
is make that cluster and grow it.

03:46:45.340 --> 03:46:47.340
No, no, no.

03:46:47.340 --> 03:46:49.340
That embryogenesis process,

03:46:49.340 --> 03:46:51.340
like that's really not well understood

03:46:51.340 --> 03:46:53.340
at all. That's really tough.

03:46:53.340 --> 03:46:55.340
I think we're much more likely to have

03:46:55.340 --> 03:46:57.340
crappy humanoid robotics.

03:46:57.340 --> 03:46:59.340
I don't think the body

03:46:59.340 --> 03:47:01.340
is overrated in terms of like

03:47:01.340 --> 03:47:03.340
if the AI system is super intelligent,

03:47:03.340 --> 03:47:05.340
it can use

03:47:05.340 --> 03:47:07.340
charm

03:47:07.340 --> 03:47:09.340
to make up for the crappy

03:47:09.340 --> 03:47:11.340
body. Yeah, I don't know. I feel like if I were

03:47:11.340 --> 03:47:13.340
an AI system and I were super intelligent, I probably

03:47:13.340 --> 03:47:15.340
would be able to solve the problem of like

03:47:15.340 --> 03:47:17.340
growing organic matter.

03:47:17.340 --> 03:47:19.340
And then I would obviously just do that. You just

03:47:19.340 --> 03:47:21.340
build exactly the organic machine that you want.

03:47:21.340 --> 03:47:23.340
Sure. That's like super intelligence.

03:47:23.340 --> 03:47:25.340
I think like with language I'm worried

03:47:25.340 --> 03:47:27.340
about before it achieves

03:47:27.340 --> 03:47:29.340
super intelligence, like

03:47:29.340 --> 03:47:31.340
true AGI, it would just be

03:47:31.340 --> 03:47:33.340
really good at talking. Yeah, that's true.

03:47:33.340 --> 03:47:35.340
And like

03:47:35.340 --> 03:47:37.340
I just don't think

03:47:37.340 --> 03:47:39.340
intelligence is a very different, like

03:47:39.340 --> 03:47:41.340
basically a scientist

03:47:41.340 --> 03:47:43.340
and a super intelligent scientist is a different

03:47:43.340 --> 03:47:45.340
thing than just a good conversation

03:47:45.340 --> 03:47:47.340
instead of a party that can undress you with their words.

03:47:47.340 --> 03:47:49.340
Would you date an AI?

03:47:49.340 --> 03:47:51.340
Way

03:47:51.340 --> 03:47:53.340
before then I could see myself being friends

03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:55.340
with an AI system.

03:47:55.340 --> 03:47:57.340
But like people are friends with

03:47:57.340 --> 03:47:59.340
inanimate objects

03:47:59.340 --> 03:48:01.340
and I have

03:48:01.340 --> 03:48:03.340
this robot behind me, I have a lot of them.

03:48:03.340 --> 03:48:05.340
I like legged robots.

03:48:05.340 --> 03:48:07.340
They're interesting.

03:48:07.340 --> 03:48:09.340
It's on the shelf. Oh, that's so cool.

03:48:09.340 --> 03:48:11.340
I didn't even notice that.

03:48:11.340 --> 03:48:13.340
Yeah, legged robots,

03:48:13.340 --> 03:48:15.340
we anthropomorphize

03:48:15.340 --> 03:48:17.340
them even more because there's something

03:48:17.340 --> 03:48:19.340
about the movement of like

03:48:19.340 --> 03:48:21.340
a

03:48:21.340 --> 03:48:23.340
thing that steps up, steps up, steps and looks

03:48:23.340 --> 03:48:25.340
up at you. There's a power to that

03:48:25.340 --> 03:48:27.340
versus like a Roomba that's just

03:48:27.340 --> 03:48:29.340
like

03:48:29.340 --> 03:48:31.340
running into the wall. Yeah, I think once, as soon

03:48:31.340 --> 03:48:33.340
as we get like some sort of empathetic

03:48:33.340 --> 03:48:35.340
expression on robot face, it's over.

03:48:35.340 --> 03:48:37.340
It's over. It's gonna be so cute. It's gonna be so

03:48:37.340 --> 03:48:39.340
easy to make it cute too.

03:48:39.340 --> 03:48:41.340
If that's what you want or you want like a

03:48:41.340 --> 03:48:43.340
dominant, like clearly this is what

03:48:43.340 --> 03:48:45.340
women want.

03:48:45.340 --> 03:48:47.340
With strong hands.

03:48:47.340 --> 03:48:49.340
Yeah. And kind of

03:48:49.340 --> 03:48:51.340
dumb.

03:48:51.340 --> 03:48:53.340
Or not. I don't know. You can

03:48:53.340 --> 03:48:55.340
customize. It'd be interesting

03:48:55.340 --> 03:48:57.340
to do a survey like how they would customize

03:48:57.340 --> 03:48:59.340
it. Like what would you want

03:48:59.340 --> 03:49:01.340
in a perfect robot? This is the

03:49:01.340 --> 03:49:03.340
problem I see with people the way they talk about

03:49:03.340 --> 03:49:05.340
robots is they kind of want a servant.

03:49:05.340 --> 03:49:07.340
I think

03:49:07.340 --> 03:49:09.340
what people don't realize

03:49:09.340 --> 03:49:11.340
what they want in relationships, they want

03:49:11.340 --> 03:49:13.340
some, like it has to be a push

03:49:13.340 --> 03:49:15.340
and pull. There has to be

03:49:15.340 --> 03:49:17.340
some resistance.

03:49:17.340 --> 03:49:19.340
You really don't want a servant.

03:49:19.340 --> 03:49:21.340
Or even like the perfect manifestation

03:49:21.340 --> 03:49:23.340
of like

03:49:23.340 --> 03:49:25.340
what you think you want.

03:49:25.340 --> 03:49:27.340
I think you want imperfections around that.

03:49:27.340 --> 03:49:29.340
Like some uncertainty. I don't know.

03:49:29.340 --> 03:49:31.340
I question how

03:49:31.340 --> 03:49:33.340
well we're able to perfectly

03:49:33.340 --> 03:49:35.340
put on paper what

03:49:35.340 --> 03:49:37.340
we really want. Would you really turn down

03:49:37.340 --> 03:49:39.340
like a perfect woman though? Like assume

03:49:39.340 --> 03:49:41.340
like she walks into the room and it's

03:49:41.340 --> 03:49:43.340
just shockingly compatible. And you like

03:49:43.340 --> 03:49:45.340
start dating her and there's just no hiccups.

03:49:45.340 --> 03:49:47.340
You fight perfectly. Like she really understands

03:49:47.340 --> 03:49:49.340
you. Like would you be like this is too perfect.

03:49:49.340 --> 03:49:51.340
I'm upset because we're not having

03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:53.340
enough imperfection.

03:49:53.340 --> 03:49:55.340
Like can you like actually imagine yourself

03:49:55.340 --> 03:49:57.340
going through that? Yeah. I think

03:49:57.340 --> 03:49:59.340
so. Because

03:49:59.340 --> 03:50:01.340
I thought you defined perfect

03:50:01.340 --> 03:50:03.340
because perfect for me would be like easy

03:50:03.340 --> 03:50:05.340
and all that kind of stuff. Right? But then I'll

03:50:05.340 --> 03:50:07.340
be like this is too easy.

03:50:07.340 --> 03:50:09.340
If I actually

03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:11.340
were to introspect

03:50:11.340 --> 03:50:13.340
what is the perfect relationship

03:50:13.340 --> 03:50:15.340
then yes maybe. Because I probably

03:50:15.340 --> 03:50:17.340
want some challenge. I probably want some

03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:19.340
chaos. Right? Like you

03:50:19.340 --> 03:50:21.340
does anyone really fully want

03:50:21.340 --> 03:50:23.340
zero conflict?

03:50:23.340 --> 03:50:25.340
Ever?

03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:27.340
Like completely perfect

03:50:27.340 --> 03:50:29.340
conflict. Like

03:50:29.340 --> 03:50:31.340
it's the thing that pressing a button. Like

03:50:31.340 --> 03:50:33.340
do you really want in a relationship

03:50:33.340 --> 03:50:35.340
anything you want you press a button you get?

03:50:35.340 --> 03:50:37.340
I don't think people want that.

03:50:37.340 --> 03:50:39.340
You might think you want that.

03:50:39.340 --> 03:50:41.340
Yeah. I guess it depends.

03:50:41.340 --> 03:50:43.340
Like there's a kind of conflict

03:50:43.340 --> 03:50:45.340
that I think I would never want. Which is something like

03:50:45.340 --> 03:50:47.340
antagonistic conflict.

03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:49.340
I wouldn't mind disagreement.

03:50:49.340 --> 03:50:51.340
Right. You know? But there's a level of

03:50:51.340 --> 03:50:53.340
fighting I would be happy to have a relationship

03:50:53.340 --> 03:50:55.340
for the rest of my life that never has like a fight

03:50:55.340 --> 03:50:57.340
of a certain

03:50:57.340 --> 03:50:59.340
shittiness.

03:50:59.340 --> 03:51:01.340
Yeah but that's shittiness.

03:51:01.340 --> 03:51:03.340
But like resistance. Like

03:51:03.340 --> 03:51:05.340
I don't know what the example is.

03:51:05.340 --> 03:51:07.340
Because I mean

03:51:07.340 --> 03:51:09.340
I partially agree with you but I just

03:51:09.340 --> 03:51:11.340
every time I would

03:51:11.340 --> 03:51:13.340
imagine like perfect flawless

03:51:13.340 --> 03:51:15.340
nothing no conflict

03:51:15.340 --> 03:51:17.340
you imagine somebody that doesn't have like a

03:51:17.340 --> 03:51:19.340
complexity of personality.

03:51:19.340 --> 03:51:21.340
Right? Like I feel like

03:51:21.340 --> 03:51:23.340
it's not even

03:51:23.340 --> 03:51:25.340
it's conflict that's laden in

03:51:25.340 --> 03:51:27.340
basic misunderstanding between human beings.

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:29.340
Like misinterpretation. Different perspectives

03:51:29.340 --> 03:51:31.340
that clash. Different world views.

03:51:31.340 --> 03:51:33.340
Different ideas. All that kind of stuff.

03:51:33.340 --> 03:51:35.340
That conflict.

03:51:35.340 --> 03:51:37.340
Yeah that sounds good.

03:51:37.340 --> 03:51:39.340
I like having somebody that could be like I don't think

03:51:39.340 --> 03:51:41.340
that's right because I have this other view.

03:51:41.340 --> 03:51:43.340
That's cool. And also like the threat

03:51:43.340 --> 03:51:45.340
of leaving. Right? Oh yeah.

03:51:45.340 --> 03:51:47.340
Like

03:51:47.340 --> 03:51:49.340
that's a kind of conflict. Yeah that's true.

03:51:49.340 --> 03:51:51.340
Like you have to be good enough for the other person

03:51:51.340 --> 03:51:53.340
or maybe you'll lose them. Yeah.

03:51:53.340 --> 03:51:55.340
And maybe a little jealousy.

03:51:55.340 --> 03:51:57.340
Like they're good at that but not too much.

03:51:59.340 --> 03:52:01.340
But like if you design all that in

03:52:01.340 --> 03:52:03.340
then

03:52:03.340 --> 03:52:05.340
I don't know. It sounds romantic.

03:52:05.340 --> 03:52:07.340
It sounds romantic. Okay.

03:52:07.340 --> 03:52:09.340
Alright.

03:52:09.340 --> 03:52:11.340
I do want to really quickly ask you about

03:52:11.340 --> 03:52:13.340
the rationalist community.

03:52:13.340 --> 03:52:15.340
Because I've

03:52:15.340 --> 03:52:17.340
gotten to know a few of them a few times.

03:52:17.340 --> 03:52:19.340
You tweeted a guideline

03:52:19.340 --> 03:52:21.340
to rationalist discourse.

03:52:21.340 --> 03:52:23.340
Basics of rationalist

03:52:23.340 --> 03:52:25.340
discourse from less wrong.

03:52:25.340 --> 03:52:27.340
What are these folks? What's the rationalist culture?

03:52:27.340 --> 03:52:29.340
What's rationalist discourse?

03:52:29.340 --> 03:52:31.340
Yeah I love

03:52:31.340 --> 03:52:33.340
the rationalists because they're interested in

03:52:33.340 --> 03:52:35.340
how do you have conversations more effectively

03:52:35.340 --> 03:52:37.340
if you're trying to figure out what's actually true.

03:52:37.340 --> 03:52:39.340
Which sounds kind of obvious

03:52:39.340 --> 03:52:41.340
but in practice it's not usually.

03:52:41.340 --> 03:52:43.340
I remember when I first started having

03:52:43.340 --> 03:52:45.340
debating conversations I was very

03:52:45.340 --> 03:52:47.340
antagonistic. I'm like oh I'm a feminist or

03:52:47.340 --> 03:52:49.340
not a feminist. And then the rationalists were generally

03:52:49.340 --> 03:52:51.340
like actually we don't know what we mean by the term

03:52:51.340 --> 03:52:53.340
feminism. How do you feel about that?

03:52:53.340 --> 03:52:55.340
It was very

03:52:55.340 --> 03:52:57.340
kind and compassionate.

03:52:57.340 --> 03:52:59.340
Even if somebody says something that sounds insane

03:52:59.340 --> 03:53:01.340
you're like okay well we're going to respect

03:53:01.340 --> 03:53:03.340
your reasoning. And even if we disagree

03:53:03.340 --> 03:53:05.340
let's actually figure out why you think the way that you

03:53:05.340 --> 03:53:07.340
think. And they're also

03:53:07.340 --> 03:53:09.340
really smart. Write a whole bunch

03:53:09.340 --> 03:53:11.340
of great stuff about how to

03:53:11.340 --> 03:53:13.340
think more clearly and with less bias.

03:53:13.340 --> 03:53:15.340
Yeah. I wonder

03:53:15.340 --> 03:53:17.340
what those conversations are because I've never really

03:53:17.340 --> 03:53:19.340
talked to those folks.

03:53:19.340 --> 03:53:21.340
So this guideline in particular I think

03:53:21.340 --> 03:53:23.340
refers to

03:53:23.340 --> 03:53:25.340
shorthand characteristics

03:53:25.340 --> 03:53:27.340
of rationalist discourse.

03:53:27.340 --> 03:53:29.340
Including

03:53:29.340 --> 03:53:31.340
expect good discourse to require energy.

03:53:31.340 --> 03:53:33.340
Don't say straightforwardly false

03:53:33.340 --> 03:53:35.340
things. Track for yourself

03:53:35.340 --> 03:53:37.340
and distinguish for others.

03:53:37.340 --> 03:53:39.340
Your inferences from your observations

03:53:39.340 --> 03:53:41.340
estimate for yourself and make clear

03:53:41.340 --> 03:53:43.340
for others. Your rough level

03:53:43.340 --> 03:53:45.340
of confidence in your assertions make your claims

03:53:45.340 --> 03:53:47.340
clear, explicit and falsifiable or

03:53:47.340 --> 03:53:49.340
explicitly acknowledge

03:53:49.340 --> 03:53:51.340
that you aren't doing so

03:53:51.340 --> 03:53:53.340
or can't so on and so forth.

03:53:53.340 --> 03:53:55.340
So don't jump to

03:53:55.340 --> 03:53:57.340
conclusions.

03:53:57.340 --> 03:53:59.340
Don't weaponize equivocation.

03:53:59.340 --> 03:54:01.340
Don't abuse categories.

03:54:01.340 --> 03:54:03.340
Don't engage. It's very aggressive

03:54:03.340 --> 03:54:05.340
guidelines. Don't engage. I do what

03:54:05.340 --> 03:54:07.340
I want. I'll let my emotions guide

03:54:07.340 --> 03:54:09.340
me. God damn it. Pro that

03:54:09.340 --> 03:54:11.340
as long as you're explicit about it. Oh yeah?

03:54:11.340 --> 03:54:13.340
Yeah. So you can be like

03:54:13.340 --> 03:54:15.340
a crazy asshole as long as you're

03:54:15.340 --> 03:54:17.340
explicit. Yeah. You can be like epistemic status,

03:54:17.340 --> 03:54:19.340
crazy asshole.

03:54:19.340 --> 03:54:21.340
Who's here to destroy the

03:54:21.340 --> 03:54:23.340
quality of the conversation.

03:54:23.340 --> 03:54:25.340
I think it's like a common misconception about rationalists

03:54:25.340 --> 03:54:27.340
is that they're kind of like Spock.

03:54:27.340 --> 03:54:29.340
Like ah, we suppress emotion

03:54:29.340 --> 03:54:31.340
and we're thinking logically herd eater. But I found

03:54:31.340 --> 03:54:33.340
this to be really not the case. Like I

03:54:33.340 --> 03:54:35.340
remember there's a left strong thread where I was like really

03:54:35.340 --> 03:54:37.340
emotional and I commented and at the beginning I was

03:54:37.340 --> 03:54:39.340
like just warning I'm just very emotional and then I

03:54:39.340 --> 03:54:41.340
just vented my emotions. And people responded

03:54:41.340 --> 03:54:43.340
really well to that. They're like cool, like you're just

03:54:43.340 --> 03:54:45.340
genuinely, truthfully expressing

03:54:45.340 --> 03:54:47.340
your state. This is actual information about the world

03:54:47.340 --> 03:54:49.340
that's important to hear. And it's just

03:54:49.340 --> 03:54:51.340
they're very interested in having things framed

03:54:51.340 --> 03:54:53.340
correctly. Like you shouldn't be claiming

03:54:53.340 --> 03:54:55.340
that your emotions are necessarily

03:54:55.340 --> 03:54:57.340
a true version of the world. And so as long as

03:54:57.340 --> 03:54:59.340
you're just clear about what the frame it is, you're fine.

03:55:01.340 --> 03:55:03.340
How do you feel about this conversation?

03:55:03.340 --> 03:55:05.340
What could we have done

03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:07.340
better?

03:55:07.340 --> 03:55:09.340
I like the conversation.

03:55:09.340 --> 03:55:11.340
I was a little worried coming in.

03:55:11.340 --> 03:55:13.340
I was like what if he only asked a couple questions

03:55:13.340 --> 03:55:15.340
and then we don't know what to talk about.

03:55:15.340 --> 03:55:17.340
But it's been quite a long time.

03:55:17.340 --> 03:55:19.340
And I covered, there's

03:55:19.340 --> 03:55:21.340
so many things I didn't cover.

03:55:21.340 --> 03:55:23.340
I like the, you have like

03:55:23.340 --> 03:55:25.340
I'm not used to talking to somebody

03:55:25.340 --> 03:55:27.340
who feels like some of the core way

03:55:27.340 --> 03:55:29.340
that they approach the world is so different than mine.

03:55:29.340 --> 03:55:31.340
Like usually the differences arrive

03:55:31.340 --> 03:55:33.340
higher up the tree, but there's something about your

03:55:33.340 --> 03:55:35.340
root system that I think is very different from mine.

03:55:35.340 --> 03:55:37.340
But also the way that you engage with

03:55:37.340 --> 03:55:39.340
others is still flexible.

03:55:39.340 --> 03:55:41.340
Usually when I encounter somebody with such a different root system,

03:55:41.340 --> 03:55:43.340
it's like more aggressive

03:55:43.340 --> 03:55:45.340
or something. But there's something

03:55:45.340 --> 03:55:47.340
about the way that you're structured that feels

03:55:47.340 --> 03:55:49.340
very gentle.

03:55:49.340 --> 03:55:51.340
Alright.

03:55:51.340 --> 03:55:53.340
Well, I'm really happy we talked.

03:55:53.340 --> 03:55:55.340
Something tells me we'll probably talk a bunch

03:55:55.340 --> 03:55:57.340
more times. I think you're a fascinating

03:55:57.340 --> 03:55:59.340
human being. I think I'm

03:55:59.340 --> 03:56:01.340
a huge fan of your work.

03:56:01.340 --> 03:56:03.340
Maybe one more question. What's the meaning of life?

03:56:03.340 --> 03:56:05.340
To want

03:56:05.340 --> 03:56:07.340
things? To search?

03:56:07.340 --> 03:56:09.340
To be in?

03:56:09.340 --> 03:56:11.340
I think your curiosity is like somehow

03:56:11.340 --> 03:56:13.340
getting to that. Yeah.

03:56:13.340 --> 03:56:15.340
To want things. Curiosity, like you don't know.

03:56:15.340 --> 03:56:17.340
I want to know the answer.

03:56:17.340 --> 03:56:19.340
To like be in the state of

03:56:19.340 --> 03:56:21.340
yearning. Of wanting, of yearning.

03:56:21.340 --> 03:56:23.340
I wonder if you could do that if you lived a million years.

03:56:23.340 --> 03:56:25.340
Just keep yearning always.

03:56:25.340 --> 03:56:27.340
That's the thing I'm probably afraid of if I lived

03:56:27.340 --> 03:56:29.340
a million years. It's not the torture.

03:56:29.340 --> 03:56:31.340
It's like the yearning will fade.

03:56:31.340 --> 03:56:33.340
They'll probably yearn to die then.

03:56:33.340 --> 03:56:35.340
Oh, just sitting there

03:56:35.340 --> 03:56:37.340
wanting death.

03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:39.340
Intensely.

03:56:39.340 --> 03:56:41.340
That's kind of

03:56:41.340 --> 03:56:43.340
romantic a little bit.

03:56:43.340 --> 03:56:45.340
It has like a bit of that spark.

03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:47.340
And constantly being denied.

03:56:47.340 --> 03:56:49.340
Wow.

03:56:49.340 --> 03:56:51.340
So most of your existence on Earth

03:56:51.340 --> 03:56:53.340
would be spent deeply

03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:55.340
intimate with death.

03:56:55.340 --> 03:56:57.340
Just thinking about death.

03:56:57.340 --> 03:56:59.340
I think we're already doing that, but

03:56:59.340 --> 03:57:01.340
like hiding that from ourselves a little bit.

03:57:01.340 --> 03:57:03.340
Anyway, wanting.

03:57:03.340 --> 03:57:05.340
Wow.

03:57:05.340 --> 03:57:07.340
This is an amazing conversation.

03:57:07.340 --> 03:57:09.340
I think you're an amazing researcher

03:57:09.340 --> 03:57:11.340
and human being. You're a great interviewer.

03:57:11.340 --> 03:57:13.340
I can see why you do this a lot.

03:57:13.340 --> 03:57:15.340
I appreciate it. This was really fun.

03:57:15.340 --> 03:57:17.340
Ayla, thank you so much for talking with me today.

03:57:17.340 --> 03:57:19.340
Thank you.

03:57:19.340 --> 03:57:21.340
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ayla.

03:57:25.340 --> 03:57:27.340
And now let me leave you with some words

03:57:27.340 --> 03:57:29.340
from Richard Feynman.

03:57:29.340 --> 03:57:31.340
Physics is like sex.

03:57:31.340 --> 03:57:33.340
Sure, it may give you some practical results,

03:57:33.340 --> 03:57:35.340
but that's not why we do it.

03:57:35.340 --> 03:57:37.340
Thank you for listening

03:57:37.340 --> 03:57:39.340
and hope to see you next time.
