00:00.000 --> 00:03.180
The following is a conversation with Kelsey Sharon,

00:03.180 --> 00:05.980
Canadian Forces veteran, artillery gunner,

00:05.980 --> 00:08.740
who served in Afghanistan at 18 years old

00:08.740 --> 00:11.820
and came home with severe PTSD.

00:11.820 --> 00:14.140
She went on to found Brass in Unity,

00:14.140 --> 00:15.900
which creates unique jewelry,

00:15.900 --> 00:18.780
large part of the proceeds from which go to help

00:18.780 --> 00:22.380
rehabilitate the lives, limbs, and mental health

00:22.380 --> 00:24.920
of veterans and first responders.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.540
She has a big personality, big heart,

00:27.620 --> 00:30.100
and an intense passion for life.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.540
So when our paths happened to cross,

00:32.540 --> 00:35.260
I knew we needed to talk.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.500
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.540
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:39.540 --> 00:40.820
in the description.

00:40.820 --> 00:44.580
And now, here's my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.340
You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you

00:48.340 --> 00:52.100
and that your grandfather was a World War II vet.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.300
So people that have gone through World War II,

00:54.300 --> 00:57.020
in my family too, they don't seem to talk about it much.

00:57.380 --> 01:00.580
The worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.500
I mean, it's understandable, I can respect that,

01:02.500 --> 01:07.500
but I don't think people fully understood the value

01:07.500 --> 01:11.540
in human stories over time and sharing that,

01:11.540 --> 01:15.380
that certain civilizations don't have written language.

01:15.380 --> 01:19.140
The value in that being passed down is extraordinary,

01:19.140 --> 01:21.180
but we didn't really have that

01:21.180 --> 01:23.140
with the World War II vets, it seems like.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.220
Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.300
My grandmother went through Holodomor,

01:30.300 --> 01:33.340
which is the Ukrainian starvation of millions of people,

01:33.340 --> 01:36.460
and then obviously went through World War II

01:36.460 --> 01:39.380
with the Nazi occupation,

01:39.380 --> 01:43.220
and same on the grandfather's side who,

01:44.260 --> 01:47.060
on my dad's side, grandfather fought in World War II.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.540
And they seem to not want to talk about those experiences

01:50.540 --> 01:53.220
to protect you from the suffering,

01:53.220 --> 01:55.660
to protect you from the evil that they've experienced,

01:55.660 --> 02:00.380
which is sad because the lessons from that history

02:00.380 --> 02:02.660
are not then propagated through you.

02:02.660 --> 02:05.540
And also there's something about the strength

02:05.540 --> 02:08.020
you carry with you knowing that that's in your blood,

02:08.020 --> 02:09.900
those great heroes are in your blood,

02:09.900 --> 02:10.740
and that's suffering,

02:10.740 --> 02:12.780
overcoming that suffering is in your blood.

02:12.780 --> 02:15.140
I would argue that's exactly correct.

02:15.140 --> 02:18.540
If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage

02:18.540 --> 02:21.180
that has done something super gnarly,

02:21.180 --> 02:25.180
that's just been a badass in so many different ways,

02:25.180 --> 02:26.620
you want to know about that person,

02:26.620 --> 02:27.980
you have that person's blood in you,

02:27.980 --> 02:29.380
that's important to acknowledge,

02:29.380 --> 02:30.900
and when that isn't shared,

02:30.900 --> 02:33.700
I feel like it's just a detriment to that individual.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.900
What do you make of World War II in terms of history?

02:37.900 --> 02:40.700
Do you think about those kinds of wars

02:40.700 --> 02:43.900
where two times more civilians died

02:43.900 --> 02:47.540
than the number of military personnel?

02:47.540 --> 02:52.540
So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians

02:52.540 --> 02:54.860
and the invasion of homes, the burning of homes,

02:55.540 --> 02:56.820
the bombing of homes, all of that.

02:56.820 --> 03:01.820
World War II for me, I find that was the first experience

03:02.100 --> 03:07.100
where I became just obsessed with history.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.700
World War II really did it for me.

03:10.660 --> 03:14.540
I'm not sure if it's because of the dramatization

03:14.540 --> 03:17.260
of film and in TV and the way

03:17.260 --> 03:19.340
that our generation has looked at it,

03:19.340 --> 03:21.780
but for me it was more than that.

03:21.780 --> 03:23.540
I felt a deep connection to it

03:23.540 --> 03:27.380
and I still can't figure out why, like a pull almost.

03:28.260 --> 03:31.020
People joke around about those past lives

03:31.020 --> 03:32.460
and those things or those connections,

03:32.460 --> 03:34.380
and there's something deeper within me

03:34.380 --> 03:36.420
that feels a pull towards that,

03:36.420 --> 03:41.340
and I'm not quite sure if it's because I had family

03:41.340 --> 03:44.020
that escaped Hungary once the Soviets came in,

03:44.020 --> 03:45.500
so thanks for that,

03:45.500 --> 03:49.500
or if it was because my grandfather served in it,

03:49.500 --> 03:52.660
or for whatever reason, I have this pull to it,

03:52.660 --> 03:57.380
so when you think about the mass casualty

03:57.380 --> 03:59.100
of the civilian population,

03:59.100 --> 04:01.460
that's very difficult for me to wrap my brain around

04:01.460 --> 04:04.220
after being in a war and seeing

04:04.220 --> 04:07.340
when you have a small subset of civilians die

04:07.340 --> 04:09.460
how much of an impact that has on that community

04:09.460 --> 04:12.540
right there in just a tiny area,

04:12.540 --> 04:15.860
so to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe

04:15.860 --> 04:17.500
and all across and all of that,

04:17.500 --> 04:18.860
I really struggle with that

04:18.860 --> 04:20.940
because I don't know that I can comprehend

04:21.940 --> 04:24.220
what that would truly mean to somebody

04:24.220 --> 04:27.940
if I didn't experience it or see it for what it is.

04:27.940 --> 04:28.780
Does that make sense?

04:28.780 --> 04:32.140
Yeah, so first of all, you're right.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.780
A lot of people are drawn to World War II

04:33.780 --> 04:34.700
for different reasons,

04:34.700 --> 04:38.860
so one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand

04:38.860 --> 04:43.140
how it's possible to have that scale of evil

04:43.140 --> 04:45.860
in very different flavors of evil.

04:45.860 --> 04:48.900
It's almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.180
and then also it's fascinating

04:50.340 --> 04:53.660
that so many people can follow leaders like that

04:53.660 --> 04:57.140
with a pride and with a love of country.

04:57.140 --> 04:57.980
Yeah.

04:57.980 --> 05:00.460
And that's like, it's almost like this weird experiment.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.740
It's like, wow, I wonder if I'm the same,

05:03.740 --> 05:08.100
I'm made from the same cloth as those people.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.580
Would I be a good German if I lived in Germany

05:12.540 --> 05:15.340
and was during the time of Hitler?

05:15.340 --> 05:19.180
Would I believe that Germany has been done wrong?

05:19.220 --> 05:20.500
I'm Jewish, by the way,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.540
which makes me a little bit more comfortable

05:22.540 --> 05:23.380
talking about this.

05:23.380 --> 05:28.220
Is would I believe in the dream sold

05:28.220 --> 05:31.060
by a charismatic dictator who says

05:31.060 --> 05:32.940
that wrongs have been done

05:32.940 --> 05:34.900
and we need to correct those wrongs?

05:34.900 --> 05:37.140
That, to me, is the compelling thing

05:37.140 --> 05:40.140
that draws me to World War II,

05:40.140 --> 05:41.500
the human nature question.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.980
I would agree with you on that.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.220
I think there's a way to look at people like that,

05:45.220 --> 05:48.780
and at that time, there was no real,

05:49.020 --> 05:50.980
there wasn't a full understanding of the psyche

05:50.980 --> 05:52.380
the way that we're starting to.

05:52.380 --> 05:56.020
I mean, we still don't understand any of it,

05:56.020 --> 05:59.820
but it seems like the time gap back then,

05:59.820 --> 06:03.140
there was no real understanding of sociopaths

06:03.140 --> 06:05.380
and narcissists and psychopaths

06:05.380 --> 06:07.180
and really what those traits were.

06:07.180 --> 06:10.620
And I feel like people will follow blindly

06:10.620 --> 06:12.740
if they're given a good enough reason.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.140
Well, if you have an individual who is ranting

06:16.140 --> 06:18.340
and screaming at the top of his lungs

06:18.340 --> 06:20.740
in the middle of these town squares

06:20.740 --> 06:22.420
and he's getting this attention,

06:22.420 --> 06:24.340
it's human nature to wanna understand

06:24.340 --> 06:27.260
and be a part of a group mentality.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.300
It's human nature to wanna fit in.

06:29.300 --> 06:33.500
And so I don't know if it's more of people were,

06:33.500 --> 06:36.740
at the beginning, were just, this is the cool thing to do,

06:36.740 --> 06:39.460
or if it was they were genuinely terrified,

06:40.700 --> 06:42.220
or if there was an aspect that was like,

06:42.220 --> 06:45.380
this guy is saying something that resonates with me.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.140
There could be a lot of different things.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.300
I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to,

06:51.180 --> 06:55.260
or no one got to really examine this individual's brain

06:55.260 --> 06:58.580
and this person and why they thought the way they thought.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.740
Cause that's always been the biggest thing for me

07:00.740 --> 07:04.220
is I'm really curious about why people do what they do.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.060
Like deeply, deeply curious about it.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.540
I'm not sure who's more interesting,

07:08.540 --> 07:11.660
the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.

07:11.660 --> 07:15.420
So, I mean, the question that's coupled with that

07:15.980 --> 07:18.060
is would history roll out in similar ways,

07:18.060 --> 07:19.780
even if there wasn't a Hitler?

07:19.780 --> 07:22.620
You know, it's the people that created Hitler

07:22.620 --> 07:26.380
or did Hitler create the events of World War II?

07:26.380 --> 07:29.540
I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.

07:29.540 --> 07:32.260
That seems to be that the charismatic leaders

07:32.260 --> 07:33.260
are all out there.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.500
The failed artists in the case of Hitler,

07:36.500 --> 07:37.660
they're all out there.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.580
And it's just when there's this environment of anger

07:40.580 --> 07:44.460
and fear, charismatic leaders can take over

07:44.500 --> 07:48.460
and it doesn't matter if they're evil or good.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.100
It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.820
What, how evil, how truly insane they are.

07:54.820 --> 07:59.820
Like, I think Stalin was much more cold in calculating.

08:00.060 --> 08:01.940
He wasn't as insane as Hitler.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.840
Hitler was legitimately insane.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.700
Like, especially later on in the war

08:06.700 --> 08:09.860
where he would do irrational actions, I would say.

08:09.860 --> 08:13.620
So, but that's like a weird roll of the dice.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.980
You could have gotten a totally different leader.

08:15.980 --> 08:19.380
The, wanting to take over the entirety of Europe

08:19.380 --> 08:23.300
and then invading Russia, that's like insanity.

08:23.300 --> 08:26.660
Yeah, that just even, just the first part of that,

08:26.660 --> 08:27.780
wanting to take over Europe,

08:27.780 --> 08:30.500
if you really think about the scale,

08:30.500 --> 08:32.380
if you really sit down and go, he want,

08:32.380 --> 08:35.500
this one individual was like, I want all of this.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.580
If you really sat down and you were to sit down

08:37.580 --> 08:40.460
and put him in his traits that we know of

08:40.460 --> 08:44.220
into any sort of document nowadays

08:44.220 --> 08:47.740
that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,

08:47.740 --> 08:50.140
this guy would set it on fire.

08:50.140 --> 08:54.540
There's, he himself was so, I think so damaged

08:54.540 --> 08:58.020
and he reminds me a lot of people now

08:58.020 --> 09:00.140
who struggle to find their way.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.460
He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no,

09:04.460 --> 09:06.380
either by women or by business

09:06.380 --> 09:10.500
or by whatever the sector they're in.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.780
He reminds me very much of that, like,

09:13.780 --> 09:15.140
what's the word I'm looking for?

09:15.140 --> 09:18.300
Just that individual who's just like, the world is shit

09:18.300 --> 09:20.420
and the world owes me everything.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.300
And it's just, it's that mentality.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.540
He really came from that, it seems like.

09:25.540 --> 09:28.300
And when you foster that too long, you get that.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.940
There's a book called, what is it?

09:30.940 --> 09:33.140
Man From Underground by Dostoevsky.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.260
I might be misnaming the book,

09:35.300 --> 09:37.780
but it's about the bitterness of a man.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.740
It's like, it breeds within his mind

09:39.740 --> 09:42.140
and it just grows, that bitterness.

09:42.140 --> 09:46.380
I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world

09:46.380 --> 09:48.340
when you're younger.

09:48.340 --> 09:49.980
You have a choice.

09:49.980 --> 09:53.220
When you fail, do you blame the world

09:53.220 --> 09:56.100
or do you hold, it's the Jaco thing.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.740
Do you carry the responsibility of that

09:58.740 --> 10:02.020
and become a better man or woman because of that?

10:02.020 --> 10:03.620
That's the decision.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.020
And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately,

10:07.660 --> 10:10.980
because he took responsibility in leadership.

10:10.980 --> 10:11.820
He's just insane.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.580
I know you can't say he wasn't a leader.

10:13.580 --> 10:17.220
Yeah, so it's not that he's a failure.

10:17.220 --> 10:21.900
He's not a failure, but you can't say he's powerless,

10:21.900 --> 10:23.140
did not take action.

10:23.140 --> 10:26.420
I think he's just basically an embodiment of the anger

10:26.420 --> 10:28.220
and the fear of people at the time.

10:29.580 --> 10:33.500
But the insanity of, obviously, many of my relatives

10:34.340 --> 10:36.580
not just murdering them, but putting them in camps

10:36.580 --> 10:40.100
and torturing them, but many of those people,

10:40.100 --> 10:42.700
Jewish people, were also some of the best scientists.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.300
The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans

10:46.300 --> 10:50.100
is, it makes no sense.

10:50.100 --> 10:53.020
So that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back

10:53.020 --> 10:56.300
at that time in history and think,

10:56.300 --> 10:58.340
are these the same humans?

10:58.340 --> 11:01.060
And also, are there echoes of that now?

11:01.060 --> 11:01.900
Yes.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.020
Is that going to happen again?

11:04.020 --> 11:06.500
Is there going to be a World War III

11:06.500 --> 11:08.780
in some other kind of way?

11:08.780 --> 11:11.140
Is there going to be some mass scale injustice

11:11.140 --> 11:15.460
in some other kind of way, which we're not yet,

11:15.460 --> 11:18.100
like because of our blindness

11:18.100 --> 11:20.300
and maybe not learning the lessons of history

11:20.300 --> 11:22.060
will allow it to happen again.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.540
And then, obviously, it's a very common thing

11:25.540 --> 11:27.980
to whatever political leader you don't like

11:27.980 --> 11:29.380
to call them Hitler.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.500
Of course, which is, that to me,

11:32.140 --> 11:35.460
I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler,

11:35.460 --> 11:38.500
the weight behind that has been completely lost

11:38.500 --> 11:40.140
in this generation.

11:40.140 --> 11:42.500
This generation does not understand

11:42.500 --> 11:46.500
what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi.

11:47.380 --> 11:52.180
Or Stalin, to be honest, the starvation,

11:52.180 --> 11:54.460
I've just been talking to a lot of folks recently,

11:54.460 --> 11:57.300
especially like North Korea with Wyoming Park.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.700
Starvation, and I remember from my grandmother,

12:00.700 --> 12:04.140
it wasn't, I mean, time and time again,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.780
not having food to eat is the thing

12:06.780 --> 12:09.940
that people say is the worst, everything.

12:09.940 --> 12:13.700
It's way worse than murder, not having food,

12:13.700 --> 12:16.060
and the places that takes your mind

12:16.060 --> 12:18.820
and the actions that forces you to do.

12:18.820 --> 12:19.740
That's terrifying.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.780
And all of that seems very distant in our history.

12:22.780 --> 12:23.940
Yeah, I love her.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.620
I watched that interview with her.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.020
She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad

12:28.020 --> 12:29.860
because when she was on Joe and she sat there

12:29.860 --> 12:32.100
and said, Joe's like, do you,

12:32.100 --> 12:33.220
have you done any therapy?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.500
And she laughed.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.100
I was like, oh, that's my girl.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.460
It's such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you

12:38.460 --> 12:40.940
to kind of talk to her and explore her mind

12:40.940 --> 12:43.540
because we kind of explore her story.

12:43.540 --> 12:44.380
Right.

12:44.380 --> 12:47.380
And that's, there's power and importance to her story,

12:47.380 --> 12:50.340
but it's so difficult to understand,

12:50.340 --> 12:54.900
like how does she become healthier and better

12:56.100 --> 12:57.540
even more so than she's already?

12:57.900 --> 13:00.940
She's recovered quite a bit.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.460
She's found herself quite a bit,

13:02.460 --> 13:05.460
but I wonder, is she haunted?

13:05.460 --> 13:06.980
You're saying questions I want to ask.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.500
Like that's what I mean because after being in a war,

13:11.500 --> 13:13.180
there are certain things,

13:13.180 --> 13:14.860
there are certain atrocities that you see

13:14.860 --> 13:18.380
that it doesn't matter the therapy that you do.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.340
And I don't care what all the special ops guys say.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.060
Like I know plenty of them that have a light switch

13:22.060 --> 13:23.740
and they turn it off and they can function,

13:23.740 --> 13:26.500
but I also know them when they've been out for 10 years.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.500
There's things that haunt people differently,

13:29.500 --> 13:31.780
but there's no way there's not something

13:31.780 --> 13:33.580
going on there deeply.

13:35.620 --> 13:38.660
Yeah, but there's also extra levels of complexity

13:38.660 --> 13:42.340
in her case because I mean,

13:42.340 --> 13:46.060
this is what just looking at history about family

13:46.060 --> 13:51.060
is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator.

13:53.340 --> 13:54.180
Right.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.660
We like the water or something.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.300
We like water or we like this

13:57.300 --> 13:59.260
because there is no like individual,

13:59.260 --> 14:01.900
like when they said there was no love or anything.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.620
But there is a love for the-

14:03.620 --> 14:04.580
Just that individual.

14:04.580 --> 14:05.420
For that individual.

14:05.420 --> 14:09.940
And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship.

14:09.940 --> 14:10.780
Oh yeah.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.260
But it's still love, like you don't know the alternative.

14:15.260 --> 14:19.020
So it's not even, it's complicated because like,

14:20.260 --> 14:23.500
I wonder if she truly explored it what you would find

14:23.500 --> 14:27.180
because the trauma, much of her trauma,

14:27.180 --> 14:30.420
I think comes from when she was escaping North Korea.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.980
Treatment by China.

14:33.900 --> 14:34.740
It's like the-

14:34.740 --> 14:37.420
And her mom and what she had to witness within that

14:37.420 --> 14:39.820
and being helpless with that on her own.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.700
So it's like evil men essentially abusing her,

14:42.700 --> 14:45.700
trading her and doing so nonchalantly.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.740
Like it's part of just the way of life

14:48.740 --> 14:51.500
that I wonder if she sees kind of,

14:51.500 --> 14:54.420
yeah, it's so complicated because childhood-

14:54.420 --> 14:55.540
It would be normal to her

14:55.540 --> 14:57.100
because she didn't know any different.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.180
Exactly, and there's, like I grew up poor,

15:01.180 --> 15:03.980
but I never sensed that.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.620
Because your parents didn't make you.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.540
Well, and everyone else around was too.

15:08.540 --> 15:09.900
And so you don't notice it.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.660
I mean, it's a cultural thing.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.300
So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it

15:14.300 --> 15:16.340
when you compare yourself to others,

15:16.340 --> 15:18.220
when you learn of the alternative.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.460
That's the dark reality when you're abused.

15:20.460 --> 15:25.460
You, I wonder, I mean, you truly begin to suffer

15:26.940 --> 15:29.420
in some kind of way when you understand

15:29.420 --> 15:31.020
that you were being abused.

15:32.300 --> 15:34.980
That's a dark kind of thought

15:34.980 --> 15:36.620
that I wonder if you live your whole life

15:36.620 --> 15:39.820
just in that abuse, if you don't know better,

15:39.820 --> 15:41.460
that that's safer.

15:41.460 --> 15:44.540
That's like, what's a better life?

15:44.540 --> 15:48.060
Going, suffering and then learning that you were suffering

15:48.060 --> 15:50.780
or just suffering until your last days.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.740
There's two ways to look at this.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.380
I'd argue on one side that suffering

15:55.380 --> 15:58.580
and suffering till you die, you know no different.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.980
So you can't have hope.

15:59.980 --> 16:03.420
You can't have this idea that there's better.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.220
And sometimes that's, keep that in its box.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.100
But then if you have kind of what you have with Park

16:09.100 --> 16:12.580
where she knows now that there's difference,

16:12.580 --> 16:15.300
she knows that there's better, then you run into those,

16:15.300 --> 16:17.180
what is the damage that has been done?

16:17.180 --> 16:19.780
What is gonna be passed on as intergenerational trauma?

16:19.780 --> 16:20.900
I know she's a mom.

16:20.900 --> 16:24.020
So it's like, now you gotta look long-term a little bit

16:24.020 --> 16:25.940
because now she's an influence on a child.

16:25.940 --> 16:30.940
And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say.

16:32.620 --> 16:34.220
And I know that sounds horrible

16:34.220 --> 16:36.020
for the living in trauma your whole life

16:36.020 --> 16:37.820
and just not knowing any better.

16:37.820 --> 16:41.780
But there's, I don't know if that saves the brain

16:42.700 --> 16:45.540
and the body and just that overall,

16:45.540 --> 16:48.140
or if it actually would be better.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.980
Because there's no way to really find that out,

16:49.980 --> 16:50.820
I don't think.

16:50.820 --> 16:51.660
Yeah, I think.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.380
But the reality is when you give people hope

16:54.380 --> 16:57.100
and you make them realize that they're suffering,

16:57.100 --> 16:58.500
you're putting a burden on them.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.820
That's the first step on a long journey.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.420
And so, and obviously she, now that she knows

17:03.420 --> 17:05.420
that there's suffering, she wants to make people

17:05.420 --> 17:08.580
in North Korea currently suffer less.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.500
And that's the admirable goal.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.300
It's what we do to each other.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.380
We just try to like, when you see suffering in the world,

17:16.380 --> 17:17.740
you try to make it better.

17:17.740 --> 17:21.020
And unmasked, that's probably in a long arc of history

17:21.020 --> 17:25.140
going to make for a better world.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.500
I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea.

17:28.500 --> 17:32.140
I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave

17:32.140 --> 17:35.220
individuals suffering when you know

17:35.220 --> 17:36.380
that they're actively suffering

17:36.380 --> 17:37.820
while you're just living your day-to-day life

17:37.820 --> 17:40.020
in the Western world, just out grocery shopping.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.660
And you see all this food and you know

17:41.660 --> 17:43.820
in the back of your mind, like that interview

17:43.820 --> 17:45.140
fucked me up a little bit, I won't lie.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.500
Like, and I had some of the girls in my office

17:46.500 --> 17:48.620
listen to it, they're just bawling.

17:48.620 --> 17:51.100
Because there's, we're all parents

17:51.100 --> 17:54.540
and there's this idea that not being able

17:54.540 --> 17:57.300
to feed our children, that just the idea

17:57.300 --> 17:58.900
of that damages the psyche.

17:58.900 --> 18:01.340
It brings up the pain in the chest,

18:01.340 --> 18:03.140
like just the idea of it.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.780
And so going to the grocery store

18:04.780 --> 18:06.380
for about a week after that,

18:06.380 --> 18:07.780
I just remember standing there looking

18:07.780 --> 18:11.020
and just going, fuck, what are we doing?

18:11.020 --> 18:12.500
But then there's that snap reality

18:12.500 --> 18:14.060
that comes into play and goes,

18:15.220 --> 18:16.340
so how do we fix that?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.620
You gotta take on China.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.820
That's never gonna happen.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.420
And the reason that's not gonna happen,

18:23.420 --> 18:24.420
it's happening again.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.580
So Akani comes down through Afghanistan,

18:26.580 --> 18:28.940
Chinese are all through Afghanistan.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.460
Iran makes the deal with China

18:31.460 --> 18:33.660
for the roadway to get the oil.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.020
Well, that's done in the blink of an eye

18:35.020 --> 18:36.420
without anyone knowing.

18:36.420 --> 18:37.820
There's no way.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.900
There's just so much at play with China.

18:39.900 --> 18:43.940
They control such a large aspect of our world,

18:43.940 --> 18:48.300
unfortunately, that to take and free North Korea,

18:48.300 --> 18:50.700
a drastic action would have to happen.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.220
And then your people would come in,

18:53.220 --> 18:54.220
it would be a mess.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.420
What do you mean your people?

18:55.420 --> 18:56.940
What do you mean your people?

18:56.940 --> 18:58.700
Hey, you're Russians.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.540
Did you hear what she said about Russians?

19:00.540 --> 19:01.460
Did you hear what she says?

19:01.460 --> 19:02.820
Russians, I love Russians.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.060
You know what I didn't love?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.260
The Russian recruiting video that came out,

19:06.260 --> 19:07.700
that shit was terrifying.

19:07.700 --> 19:08.540
Did you watch it?

19:08.540 --> 19:09.380
No.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.220
Of course you didn't watch it.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.060
I didn't watch it, I'm sorry.

19:11.060 --> 19:11.900
Oh, shocker.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.980
The USA put out a recruiting video,

19:15.980 --> 19:19.980
and then like a day or two later, Russia put one out.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.900
And the recruiting video in the States

19:21.900 --> 19:26.900
was a animation of a female soldier with two moms,

19:28.540 --> 19:31.740
and she was gonna go change the world, right?

19:31.740 --> 19:33.340
Russia came out with one.

19:33.340 --> 19:38.340
It's like, it's the character from like Rocky,

19:38.580 --> 19:40.580
essentially, and there are guys in the mud

19:40.580 --> 19:42.740
and just in the rain just fucking doing pushups,

19:42.740 --> 19:43.740
just pushing it out.

19:43.740 --> 19:45.260
They're just like, they see their boot,

19:45.260 --> 19:46.700
they're just like crushing things,

19:46.700 --> 19:48.460
and I'm like, and it's all like,

19:48.460 --> 19:51.700
and the deep Russian voice, I'm like, oh my God.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.260
Which one is better, would you say?

19:53.260 --> 19:55.940
Which bothered you more?

19:55.940 --> 19:58.860
What do you mean by bother, specify?

19:58.860 --> 20:00.500
So deception is a funny thing,

20:00.500 --> 20:01.500
because when you're young

20:01.500 --> 20:04.100
and you're choosing to go to the military or not,

20:04.100 --> 20:06.380
it's not like you know, like none of us know

20:06.380 --> 20:08.900
what the best trajectory for life is.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.340
For many people, going to the military

20:10.340 --> 20:13.420
is a really, makes them incredible human beings.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.260
Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.700
So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like

20:18.700 --> 20:20.380
it's somehow bad to go to the military.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.900
I think it's a great choice.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.460
But there is something, the honest truth is

20:25.460 --> 20:27.260
I just don't like marketing people.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.460
Well.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.620
And so this is essentially a marketing effort.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.900
Yeah, it is a marketing effort.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.740
And so which one do you like as a marketing effort better?

20:34.740 --> 20:35.740
Russia.

20:36.700 --> 20:37.540
Oof, yeah, I do.

20:37.540 --> 20:38.380
There you go.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.500
I do, cause Canada doesn't,

20:39.500 --> 20:41.300
you know what our recruiting videos are?

20:41.300 --> 20:44.020
It's like, I love it.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.100
They're the best.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.180
Sorry, A.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.620
Yeah, oh fuck, here we go.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.500
It's starting, it started, awesome.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.140
So Canada does these ones where it's like,

20:53.140 --> 20:56.540
it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing movements

20:56.540 --> 20:58.260
and then they'll like snip it together really quick.

20:58.260 --> 21:01.500
It'll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping of a plane.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.940
And then it'll be like an artillery

21:02.940 --> 21:04.140
and then like an armored.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.540
And it'd be like, join the Canadian forces today.

21:07.540 --> 21:10.180
And like, that's like their videos.

21:10.180 --> 21:14.100
So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians

21:14.100 --> 21:15.660
who don't really want war

21:15.660 --> 21:17.900
and who don't really acknowledge their military

21:17.900 --> 21:20.540
in the first place and do everything they can

21:20.540 --> 21:22.660
to make sure that vets don't get any support

21:22.660 --> 21:24.100
when they come home.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.540
So I can see why that one is acceptable.

21:27.540 --> 21:29.820
What Russia did was meant to be more

21:29.820 --> 21:31.940
of an intimidation tactic in my opinion.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.020
I like that style better though.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.540
I think we need people to be harder.

21:38.540 --> 21:40.900
I think it's acceptable and okay to say

21:40.900 --> 21:43.500
that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,

21:43.500 --> 21:45.860
a stronger mindset, a better mentality

21:45.860 --> 21:48.180
and mental health support going into the service

21:48.180 --> 21:49.900
and a harder body.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.900
Because I know when you go to the US,

21:52.900 --> 21:56.740
I've also encountered plenty of soldiers that are 600 pounds.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.060
What are you gonna do?

21:59.180 --> 22:01.700
So we should say that when you join the military,

22:02.420 --> 22:05.020
you're in incredible shape or not maybe incredible,

22:05.020 --> 22:05.860
but very good shape.

22:05.860 --> 22:06.700
No, I was in incredible shape.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.660
It was the best shape of my life.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.500
Yeah.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.340
Yeah.

22:09.340 --> 22:10.180
So.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.020
I'm okay with that.

22:11.020 --> 22:11.860
It's okay.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.700
You know what?

22:12.700 --> 22:14.100
I used to do sit-ups.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.900
No, I would do sit-ups in the morning when I was little

22:16.900 --> 22:18.180
until I could see my six.

22:18.180 --> 22:21.460
I always had a six pack because all I did was train.

22:21.460 --> 22:23.940
But if I couldn't see it,

22:23.940 --> 22:25.860
I would just sit there in morning cartoons

22:25.860 --> 22:26.780
and just do sit-ups.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.580
And my mom and dad thought that was normal,

22:28.580 --> 22:30.140
acceptable behavior.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.780
So if you had like Instagram back then,

22:31.780 --> 22:32.940
you'd be a David Goggins.

22:32.940 --> 22:33.780
You would be just like screaming.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.780
Without the cursing.

22:34.780 --> 22:36.660
That cursing started once the military started.

22:36.660 --> 22:38.060
Okay, got it.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.060
So, I mean, people should know,

22:40.060 --> 22:41.100
because they probably already know

22:41.100 --> 22:43.060
that you also competed in Taekwondo.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.820
Like you were an athlete of all kinds.

22:45.820 --> 22:47.300
Even saw rugby in there.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.300
Yeah, I was good at rugby.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.020
I played that for seven, six years,

22:54.020 --> 22:55.980
I guess you could say total.

22:55.980 --> 22:58.500
I think the worst injury I ever ended up having

22:58.500 --> 23:00.860
was I tore my right eyelid off.

23:00.860 --> 23:02.740
We were doing an exhibition game.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.260
I don't do exhibition games well.

23:04.260 --> 23:06.180
I don't do like for fun well.

23:06.180 --> 23:07.020
I don't do like-

23:07.020 --> 23:07.860
So you're very competitive.

23:07.860 --> 23:09.820
No, not me.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.500
So you're being funny.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.820
There it is, he gets it.

23:12.820 --> 23:15.460
You see, he's not a robot.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.140
What I was saying though to you was that

23:20.460 --> 23:22.220
we did an exhibition game

23:22.220 --> 23:24.660
and the team ahead was winning.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.620
The team we were playing was winning,

23:26.620 --> 23:28.220
which was annoying.

23:29.220 --> 23:32.020
There was an opportunity to take out a girl

23:32.020 --> 23:34.220
that was going one end of the field to the other

23:34.220 --> 23:36.740
and she just kept hitting tries left, right and center.

23:36.740 --> 23:37.900
She was fast.

23:37.900 --> 23:40.140
So I figured if I just aimed her up,

23:40.140 --> 23:41.300
like she's a target,

23:41.300 --> 23:43.260
and I just run full force at her,

23:43.260 --> 23:45.980
because she was a tall individual.

23:45.980 --> 23:48.460
If I do that, I'll take her out of the knees.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.380
So I did that.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.100
But what that resulted in was

23:52.100 --> 23:53.660
she put her tooth through her mouth guard

23:53.660 --> 23:55.500
and knocked out and she just stayed there.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.940
But when I stood up,

23:56.940 --> 23:58.660
I tore the right eyelid off

23:58.660 --> 24:00.940
and it was hanging from the inner corner.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.900
My mom was there,

24:01.900 --> 24:05.460
because mom's my biggest fan.

24:05.460 --> 24:06.580
She was supportive of this?

24:06.580 --> 24:07.940
She's supportive of everything.

24:07.940 --> 24:08.980
She didn't miss a game.

24:08.980 --> 24:10.620
She didn't miss in anything.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.940
And I stood up and I kind of turned around

24:12.940 --> 24:15.140
and we already had a girl break her nose that day.

24:15.140 --> 24:17.780
So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways

24:17.780 --> 24:19.020
and just bloody.

24:19.020 --> 24:19.840
My mom was like,

24:19.840 --> 24:22.580
I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over.

24:22.580 --> 24:23.980
And so I turned around and looked at her

24:24.660 --> 24:26.660
and she almost vomited on the spot.

24:26.660 --> 24:27.500
And I was like, what's wrong?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.980
She's like, don't move your eyelids off.

24:29.980 --> 24:31.060
I'm like, but I can see.

24:31.060 --> 24:32.620
I was trying to blink,

24:32.620 --> 24:35.900
but it was just down so I could just constantly see.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.380
She's like, we're just gonna go to the emergency.

24:38.380 --> 24:39.540
We're just gonna go there now.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.540
Was there blood?

24:40.540 --> 24:41.660
Yeah, there's lots of it.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.500
But I couldn't really tell.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.620
Okay.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.820
Were you okay with blood at that point?

24:46.820 --> 24:47.660
Yeah, I've always been okay with blood.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.420
I guess you did taekwondo and all that, yeah.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.820
I didn't get knocked out very often.

24:50.820 --> 24:51.700
I didn't really,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.140
when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.340
I only lost a handful of times.

24:56.340 --> 24:58.060
So when I did lose, that was bad.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.820
But I never had like a broken nose

25:01.820 --> 25:03.500
or a lot of blood on my face,

25:03.500 --> 25:05.180
like nothing like that really.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.900
So nothing freaked me out too much.

25:07.900 --> 25:08.860
Was there aggression there

25:08.860 --> 25:11.260
or just purely competition over skill?

25:12.460 --> 25:14.100
A mix of both.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.500
I was, this was right after,

25:16.500 --> 25:19.460
not too long after my coach went to prison

25:19.460 --> 25:20.580
for statutory rape.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.820
And that was like how you talk about Park

25:23.820 --> 25:27.420
talking about how that was like,

25:27.420 --> 25:30.780
she knew love because of that person.

25:30.780 --> 25:33.340
That person was like a God to me.

25:33.340 --> 25:34.380
And so when that happened,

25:34.380 --> 25:36.180
I was just an angry individual from that point on.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.860
So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.

25:38.860 --> 25:39.980
Oh, like it was betrayal?

25:39.980 --> 25:44.980
That there's somebody that was a symbol of love for you

25:44.980 --> 25:46.700
could also be a very bad person?

25:46.700 --> 25:48.380
I used to eat, sleep, and breathe,

25:48.380 --> 25:51.060
whatever that man said from four years old on.

25:52.020 --> 25:54.460
I lived with my coaches at a point

25:54.460 --> 25:55.700
so I could train that much.

25:55.700 --> 25:57.820
I helped look after their daughter.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.100
I was at the club 24 seven.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.940
It's just the idea that somebody

26:01.940 --> 26:03.100
could do something like that.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.740
Yeah, that really messed me up.

26:05.580 --> 26:08.380
Where were you on 9-11?

26:10.180 --> 26:14.140
I was 11 and I was in my parents basement.

26:15.460 --> 26:16.780
In where?

26:16.780 --> 26:17.620
Ontario.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.140
In Ontario, Canada.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.460
Ontario, Canada.

26:20.460 --> 26:24.420
What did you think of 9-11 at that age from Canada?

26:24.420 --> 26:29.420
Did it have an impact on you in terms of changing

26:29.500 --> 26:34.500
the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?

26:35.420 --> 26:36.500
Not initially.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.380
I remember it really vividly.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.140
I have a decent memory for certain things, it seems like.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.820
Stuff like that I stick with really well.

26:44.820 --> 26:46.620
I remember watching, I was sitting on the couch

26:46.660 --> 26:49.900
and my mom called my dad,

26:49.900 --> 26:51.380
because my parents are truck drivers.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.860
My dad was on the road, if I'm not mistaken.

26:53.860 --> 26:56.500
And he would go in and out of cities all the time.

26:56.500 --> 26:57.700
And I think he was on the East Coast.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.980
My mom was like a little panicky.

26:58.980 --> 27:01.500
So she tried to get ahold of him on the,

27:01.500 --> 27:03.980
I think she, at the time it was like beepers.

27:03.980 --> 27:06.900
And yeah, so he would get a beep.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.260
He would go to a payphone and call us and he was fine.

27:09.260 --> 27:13.300
And I remember my mom being like really upset

27:13.300 --> 27:16.420
and I couldn't quite grasp why she was so upset.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.580
I knew something really bad had happened.

27:18.580 --> 27:22.140
It's when I then saw the second plane go into the tower

27:22.140 --> 27:25.100
and I remember her just like the stereotypical

27:25.100 --> 27:27.140
like hand over her mouth and she just felt sick.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.580
And she just was so confused.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.660
And I knew it was bad, but I didn't fully grasp it.

27:33.660 --> 27:35.620
We went to school that day

27:35.620 --> 27:36.820
and they had talked about it briefly.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.300
You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.

27:39.300 --> 27:44.300
There was a point that week that all of a sudden

27:45.100 --> 27:48.460
all of the children who were from a Middle Eastern family

27:48.460 --> 27:49.620
were not at the school.

27:50.740 --> 27:52.300
I just remember them saying like

27:52.300 --> 27:54.060
a lot of people aren't coming to school,

27:54.060 --> 27:56.580
but it was in particular.

27:56.580 --> 27:59.140
I think parents were afraid once it got out

27:59.140 --> 28:02.260
that it was of a certain group,

28:02.260 --> 28:03.740
they were afraid for their own kids.

28:03.740 --> 28:07.460
And fair enough, I mean, you never know, you don't know.

28:07.460 --> 28:11.260
And I knew it impacted me enough that I did write,

28:11.260 --> 28:15.020
I remember the school was doing a memorial for it.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.740
And I remember they asked, I wrote a poem

28:17.740 --> 28:20.660
and a reporter was there and I read it on air.

28:20.660 --> 28:25.660
That's like, I remember, it was a very short one,

28:25.900 --> 28:28.020
but I remember I wanted to do something,

28:28.020 --> 28:30.380
but I didn't know why or for what reason.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.620
I knew I wanted to do something to honor it,

28:32.620 --> 28:34.580
but I couldn't grasp why.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.860
You eventually went to Afghanistan.

28:36.860 --> 28:37.820
Yeah.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.620
Did that begin to plant the seed

28:40.620 --> 28:44.420
of thinking about conflict in the world?

28:44.420 --> 28:45.260
It's a good question.

28:45.260 --> 28:47.260
I've never thought about it that in depth.

28:47.260 --> 28:48.660
I mean, I've done 12 years of therapy.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.540
You think that would have come up Dr. Passy,

28:50.540 --> 28:52.340
but apparently not.

28:52.340 --> 28:53.460
We'll work on it though.

28:53.460 --> 28:58.460
I mean, when did the idea of war start entering your mind?

28:58.780 --> 29:01.260
Late high school, I think it was for me.

29:01.260 --> 29:04.420
I finished high school at 17.

29:04.420 --> 29:07.140
I moved away and went to college

29:08.140 --> 29:10.420
because I wasn't smart enough to get into Ottawa U.

29:10.420 --> 29:13.860
So I was like, well, Algonquin she is.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.180
I just wanted to play sports and frankly,

29:16.180 --> 29:18.300
I wanted away from my small town that I was living in.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.660
I went through like a bad high school breakup as a kid

29:20.660 --> 29:23.460
and that where you think that's like the love of your life

29:23.460 --> 29:26.860
and you just can't bear to be anywhere near anybody.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.100
And so I moved away as fast as I possibly could

29:30.100 --> 29:33.860
and I didn't grasp it still at that point.

29:34.860 --> 29:38.300
Love and heartbreak.

29:39.580 --> 29:42.500
Okay, why did you become a soldier?

29:42.500 --> 29:45.180
Why did you want to become a soldier?

29:45.180 --> 29:46.620
My parents told me from an early age,

29:46.620 --> 29:48.780
they always figured I would either be a cop.

29:48.780 --> 29:51.140
I would do, they didn't think military,

29:51.140 --> 29:53.820
but they thought it would be like a type A personality,

29:53.820 --> 29:56.580
possibly carry a gun situation.

29:56.580 --> 29:59.340
And I had never hunted before.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.540
We'd never had guns in our house.

30:00.540 --> 30:03.900
I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.

30:03.900 --> 30:06.260
If anything, it was the opposite.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.340
We just, all the hunters on the property,

30:08.340 --> 30:10.540
like all the deer would come to our property

30:10.540 --> 30:12.020
and all the hunters would be, no, I'm not,

30:12.020 --> 30:13.620
my mom would put salt looks out

30:13.620 --> 30:14.820
so that they wouldn't get killed.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.700
Your property was the safe space for the deer.

30:16.700 --> 30:20.100
Yeah, it was 17 acres of forest and they just,

30:20.100 --> 30:22.260
we had two turkeys that used to walk up and down

30:22.260 --> 30:23.420
the driveway every day.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.180
We had bears in there and nobody bothered them.

30:26.180 --> 30:30.020
And so there was no aspect of like, I wanna go kill shit.

30:30.060 --> 30:31.340
That was not like a thing.

30:31.340 --> 30:32.740
I had no idea I wanted to take anybody

30:32.740 --> 30:35.860
off the face of the earth or anything.

30:35.860 --> 30:39.380
I went to school and because I'm a history person,

30:39.380 --> 30:43.980
my parents has always made it really important

30:43.980 --> 30:46.340
that Remembrance Day is the thing in our life.

30:46.340 --> 30:47.500
So that's Veterans Day for you.

30:47.500 --> 30:51.820
So it's November 11th and it's, you go, you honor.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.100
I don't care if you don't wanna go.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.820
I don't care if it's raining, you go.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.900
And so I went to the Remembrance Day ceremony

30:58.940 --> 31:01.420
in Ottawa that year, which was, it's our capital,

31:01.420 --> 31:04.740
which is, yeah, it's our capital and it's really small.

31:04.740 --> 31:07.260
And so I went, but I took the bus

31:07.260 --> 31:10.300
and I was on the bus back to Algonquin

31:10.300 --> 31:14.500
and I met a lady who was like a World War II vet,

31:14.500 --> 31:16.220
really old lady.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.420
She had an Air Force uniform on

31:17.420 --> 31:18.860
and just like this row of medals.

31:18.860 --> 31:22.900
And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited

31:22.900 --> 31:25.340
to extreme interactions we've had

31:25.340 --> 31:26.820
over the short period of time,

31:26.820 --> 31:29.060
I'm curious and I'll just ask you.

31:29.060 --> 31:30.900
And so I just got up and talked to her

31:30.900 --> 31:32.420
and just started talking to her.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.980
And she didn't say, like, I don't remember exactly

31:34.980 --> 31:37.380
her words, but she'd served.

31:37.380 --> 31:40.620
She was one of the first females to fly

31:40.620 --> 31:44.260
and all of these kinds of things that stuck in my head.

31:44.260 --> 31:47.140
And we just kinda kept talking and I missed my stop.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.020
And then I finished talking to her

31:49.020 --> 31:52.100
and I got back on the bus and went back to the college

31:52.100 --> 31:55.580
and walked into my small apartment

31:55.580 --> 31:57.660
where I had two roommates,

31:57.660 --> 31:59.340
these two guys I went to high school with,

31:59.340 --> 32:00.260
one of them I went to high school with,

32:00.260 --> 32:01.100
one was from out of town.

32:01.100 --> 32:04.780
And I just didn't like what I was, I wasn't happy.

32:04.780 --> 32:08.220
I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.

32:08.220 --> 32:11.060
And I didn't know what I wanted to do truthfully.

32:11.060 --> 32:14.540
Something just said, why don't you join the army?

32:14.540 --> 32:16.700
Like in myself, my self-talk was like,

32:16.700 --> 32:18.620
let's just join the military, let's do it.

32:19.580 --> 32:22.260
Hey, you in general, somebody that just follows the gut,

32:22.260 --> 32:25.140
like when your heart tells you something, you go with it?

32:25.660 --> 32:28.380
I mean, for the most part, because I figured out,

32:28.380 --> 32:31.700
at least now I figured out what parts I could,

32:31.700 --> 32:33.820
like what feeling I can trust and which one I can't.

32:33.820 --> 32:35.980
Which one's anxiety versus which one's

32:35.980 --> 32:37.660
my actual intuition talking.

32:37.660 --> 32:40.100
So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?

32:40.100 --> 32:42.660
Because they wouldn't let me be infantry.

32:42.660 --> 32:46.060
I mean, why would you want to be infantry?

32:49.260 --> 32:53.900
I mean, you're naming a lot of dangerous activities.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.220
I didn't even have a thought in my mind at the time.

32:56.220 --> 32:58.260
My idea was if I was going to do this

32:58.260 --> 32:59.820
and I was going to put myself through the bullshit

32:59.820 --> 33:02.260
and the training and all of the hell and the pushups

33:02.260 --> 33:04.100
and the getting blah, blah, blah screamed at,

33:04.100 --> 33:05.300
I wanted to do something that I know

33:05.300 --> 33:06.980
was actually going to be affecting something.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.180
And what I knew was making change or affecting

33:09.180 --> 33:12.580
or on the front lines was infantry, artillery, or armored.

33:12.580 --> 33:13.900
So I was like, one of those.

33:13.900 --> 33:15.140
Can you explain the difference

33:15.140 --> 33:17.300
to infantry, artillery, and armored?

33:17.300 --> 33:18.500
Do you want like the layman's term

33:18.500 --> 33:20.660
or do you want me to actually explain, explain?

33:20.660 --> 33:22.660
Well, listening to your conversation with Jaco,

33:22.660 --> 33:24.780
especially I love how you get into details.

33:24.780 --> 33:27.020
Okay, so let's detail this one.

33:27.020 --> 33:30.900
So infantry is your frontline door kicking,

33:32.660 --> 33:34.420
blasting the door open, running

33:34.420 --> 33:36.580
and get the fuck on the ground, just that, that, that, that.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.620
They're the guys that double tap you in the face

33:38.620 --> 33:40.340
and they show up in the middle of the night

33:40.340 --> 33:42.020
and put a barrel in your head.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.860
Those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches

33:44.860 --> 33:47.500
that are eating MREs, who are being shot at,

33:47.500 --> 33:50.220
who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work

33:50.660 --> 33:53.300
and not sleeping and carrying the 100 pound pack

33:53.300 --> 33:56.420
and are side by side with your buddies in the trenches.

33:56.420 --> 33:59.380
I wanted that, that.

33:59.380 --> 34:01.460
They said it was too small for that.

34:01.460 --> 34:02.300
So then it's-

34:02.300 --> 34:03.140
You were, sorry to interrupt,

34:03.140 --> 34:05.660
you were too small under 100 pounds?

34:05.660 --> 34:08.980
At the time I was about 103 and I'm five foot,

34:08.980 --> 34:10.740
like on a, if you roll my back out,

34:10.740 --> 34:14.580
like I really try, I'm five foot.

34:14.580 --> 34:19.580
At the time though, I think my license said 411, so.

34:19.780 --> 34:21.940
So you were too small-

34:21.940 --> 34:22.780
Too small.

34:22.780 --> 34:23.620
For infantry.

34:23.620 --> 34:26.260
Yeah, they just, like, there was no mandate

34:26.260 --> 34:28.620
at which they said you can't be, but they said, you know,

34:28.620 --> 34:30.060
we don't want to put you through training

34:30.060 --> 34:31.020
that you're going to fail out of

34:31.020 --> 34:32.180
and then have to recourse you

34:32.180 --> 34:33.500
and then find a new job for you.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.820
And they want to try to, if this is what you're going in for,

34:36.820 --> 34:39.500
they want to have you follow through that path.

34:39.500 --> 34:42.780
So then there was armored, which are your tanks.

34:42.780 --> 34:46.740
So that's your movie, like Fury, where your tank battles

34:46.740 --> 34:48.460
and which we don't really do anymore,

34:48.460 --> 34:50.180
but you're rolling around in tanks,

34:50.180 --> 34:51.020
you've got guys in the back,

34:51.020 --> 34:53.340
or you're a driver or you're a turret gunner,

34:53.340 --> 34:54.780
which I would have enjoyed,

34:54.780 --> 34:58.940
but the idea of being in a closed metal box,

34:58.940 --> 35:00.420
something about it made me panic.

35:00.420 --> 35:02.740
So I was like, maybe not for me.

35:02.740 --> 35:07.580
Oh, there's of course power to that kind of big gun.

35:07.580 --> 35:08.780
Well, that's why I went for the bigger one.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.700
Okay, by the way,

35:09.700 --> 35:12.580
I think Russia leads the world in number of tanks.

35:12.580 --> 35:15.500
They're still, it's very like, what is it?

35:15.500 --> 35:18.260
Alpha demonstration of like force.

35:19.100 --> 35:20.620
Look, we have largest number of tanks.

35:20.620 --> 35:22.220
You know what takes tanks out though?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.060
What?

35:23.060 --> 35:25.460
Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.

35:25.460 --> 35:27.540
Yeah, but tanks still look bad ass.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.260
They look great, but they don't last.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.660
But so much of the military,

35:30.660 --> 35:32.660
like we said with the recruiting videos,

35:32.660 --> 35:33.980
it's a display of power

35:33.980 --> 35:36.900
versus the actual implementation of power.

35:36.900 --> 35:37.820
Fair.

35:37.820 --> 35:39.100
Okay, artillery.

35:39.100 --> 35:40.420
So I'm doing my best here.

35:40.420 --> 35:42.340
Yeah, I don't even know what double tap means,

35:42.340 --> 35:43.340
which you said earlier.

35:43.340 --> 35:45.860
So it's double tap is like two shots to the face.

35:45.860 --> 35:47.100
Why two?

35:47.100 --> 35:48.100
To be sure.

35:48.940 --> 35:49.780
Okay, all right.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.380
You guys, taxpayers pay for the ammo.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.220
It's fine.

35:52.220 --> 35:53.180
So, but you don't want to do three

35:53.180 --> 35:54.020
because it's wasting the ammo.

35:54.020 --> 35:55.180
Well, that's no, that's a waste.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.060
Okay, double tap to the face.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.940
There's so much awesome terminology here

35:58.940 --> 36:02.140
or gruesome terminology, depending on your perspective.

36:02.140 --> 36:03.900
Okay, so artillery.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.260
Yeah, so that's the hand of God.

36:08.460 --> 36:09.300
Sorry.

36:09.300 --> 36:13.940
No, that's intensely a romanticized version,

36:13.940 --> 36:16.180
but okay, artillery, the hand of God.

36:16.460 --> 36:17.940
Because it will reach out and touch you

36:17.940 --> 36:19.620
from wherever we want.

36:19.620 --> 36:24.300
It's like F-18 pilots or bombers.

36:24.300 --> 36:28.100
They'll, you won't know they're there until they're there.

36:28.100 --> 36:30.140
And so for artillery,

36:30.140 --> 36:32.100
I really honestly didn't think

36:32.100 --> 36:33.820
artillery would be a fit for me.

36:33.820 --> 36:35.140
I didn't know much about it.

36:35.140 --> 36:35.980
They were just like,

36:35.980 --> 36:38.260
these are what you can pick from.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.180
And I was like, I'll go here.

36:40.180 --> 36:43.780
So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.620
We're called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery

36:46.620 --> 36:49.860
because the Queen made us Royal Canadian Artillery.

36:49.860 --> 36:52.340
And we shoot these rounds.

36:52.340 --> 36:55.060
When you're in training, you shoot smaller ammunition.

36:55.060 --> 36:56.500
They're about 40 pounds.

36:56.500 --> 37:00.660
They go, I'm gonna get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers.

37:00.660 --> 37:03.860
So whatever that is in your mile things.

37:03.860 --> 37:08.780
And they have a casing on them and they're much easier.

37:08.780 --> 37:10.300
They're easier to handle.

37:10.300 --> 37:11.260
The guns are smaller.

37:11.260 --> 37:12.540
You need less people for them.

37:12.540 --> 37:14.340
They're basically what you train on nowadays.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.140
It's not what we use overseas.

37:16.140 --> 37:19.340
What we use overseas, now those things are beautiful.

37:19.340 --> 37:22.700
Those are just a sheer work of...

37:22.700 --> 37:25.700
The engineering behind them just makes my heart skip a beat.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.340
Yeah, the engineering on modern guns is amazing.

37:27.340 --> 37:28.940
So are we talking about machine guns here?

37:28.940 --> 37:30.420
So fully automatic?

37:30.420 --> 37:31.700
No, you're talking about artillery guns.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.940
So what it is, it's a 155 millimeter Howitzer

37:34.940 --> 37:38.380
that shoots up to 40 kilometers accurately,

37:38.380 --> 37:41.100
45 unrecorded.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.860
And it shoots a 100 pound round.

37:43.780 --> 37:46.660
Oh, okay.

37:47.740 --> 37:50.180
So that, but there is still precision.

37:50.180 --> 37:51.180
Accurate as hell.

37:51.180 --> 37:52.220
Accurate, okay.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.700
Accurate if the people behind it that are shooting it

37:54.700 --> 37:56.540
and aiming it are accurate.

37:56.540 --> 38:01.540
Okay, so at which stage of the warfare do they come in?

38:01.900 --> 38:03.700
Are they saving you?

38:03.700 --> 38:06.060
Say a bunch of people get raided,

38:06.060 --> 38:07.940
a bunch of the sole infantry get raided

38:07.940 --> 38:09.900
and then the artillery saves them

38:09.900 --> 38:12.820
or are they the first line of attack or what are they,

38:12.820 --> 38:14.660
where does the artillery come?

38:14.660 --> 38:17.820
Like the hand of God presumes they're helping.

38:17.820 --> 38:19.460
Yeah, yeah, well, that's it.

38:19.460 --> 38:23.180
So depending on the operation or whomever is running it

38:23.180 --> 38:24.340
or how they want it done,

38:24.340 --> 38:26.860
sometimes if they just know there's targets,

38:26.860 --> 38:29.180
they'll use us, high value targets.

38:29.180 --> 38:32.660
So we have this round, it's called the Excalibur round.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.660
It costs about half a million dollars per round.

38:34.660 --> 38:39.140
It comes in a special tube that is sealed and locked

38:39.140 --> 38:41.380
and you have to get permission from Ottawa to shoot it

38:41.380 --> 38:43.380
and it's only used for VIP targets.

38:43.380 --> 38:47.300
So like we have VIP for everyone and it will,

38:47.300 --> 38:50.220
it's GPS guided, it's rocket propelled

38:50.220 --> 38:55.220
and when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall

38:55.340 --> 38:56.980
and somebody's standing on this side of it,

38:56.980 --> 38:58.100
we'll hit you right there.

38:58.100 --> 39:01.380
We won't touch that wall, it will hit you pinpoint.

39:01.380 --> 39:04.420
It'll go right through whatever concrete, whatever

39:04.420 --> 39:06.420
and then it will destroy.

39:06.420 --> 39:09.540
So it's basically the same thing as being a sniper

39:09.540 --> 39:12.540
but with a much more damaging weapon.

39:12.540 --> 39:13.900
We don't use that round often.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.180
I think it's only been used a handful of times, Max,

39:16.180 --> 39:18.060
in Afghanistan that I'm aware of.

39:18.060 --> 39:22.580
Again, I haven't, I wasn't there from 2009 until 21

39:22.580 --> 39:25.780
but I know people that still deployed in those units

39:25.780 --> 39:28.020
and I don't know that it was used very often

39:28.020 --> 39:30.740
but the regular round, so there's HE, there's Loom.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.420
So HE is high explosive.

39:32.420 --> 39:35.740
There's Loom, you shoot that, it explodes in the sky,

39:35.780 --> 39:37.820
it lights up the sky for the infantry below

39:39.060 --> 39:41.140
and then there's shrapnel rounds that will explode

39:41.140 --> 39:43.700
in the sky and then shrapnel just rains down hell on you.

39:43.700 --> 39:47.780
HE is what you use normally in my,

39:47.780 --> 39:51.180
I'm trying to say this right because I know people squawked

39:51.180 --> 39:52.380
at me about some of the stuff on Jocko

39:52.380 --> 39:53.660
so I'm trying to be very accurate.

39:53.660 --> 39:56.940
In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people

39:56.940 --> 39:59.980
off the face of the earth when the infantry needed us.

39:59.980 --> 40:03.460
So we would get a call at any time

40:03.460 --> 40:05.740
and there's always two guns together

40:05.740 --> 40:08.420
so you never go solo gun, ever.

40:08.420 --> 40:11.780
If you are, it's sketchy and there's,

40:11.780 --> 40:12.780
bad shit's happening.

40:12.780 --> 40:15.220
Can you explain that, so there's two people, two guns?

40:15.220 --> 40:17.460
No, two guns with each gun troop.

40:17.460 --> 40:19.140
So each gun troop has five to seven people

40:19.140 --> 40:20.460
running a gun at all times.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.300
Oh wow, okay.

40:21.300 --> 40:22.540
It takes a lot of people to run one of those.

40:22.540 --> 40:24.180
How much electronics is there?

40:24.180 --> 40:26.900
The GPS, like the computer system that's on it itself,

40:26.900 --> 40:30.660
I never ran that much but it is completely technologically,

40:30.660 --> 40:32.580
it's GPS guided.

40:32.580 --> 40:35.340
All you have to do is literally type in the coordinates

40:35.340 --> 40:36.980
then you've got the two big,

40:37.980 --> 40:41.300
there's a technical word for it but basically wheels

40:41.300 --> 40:44.020
and one does the trajectory, you do your,

40:44.020 --> 40:45.220
and you're just kind of doing this

40:45.220 --> 40:46.700
and you're watching the watch in it

40:46.700 --> 40:49.740
and once you hit your target, you know it'll tell you.

40:49.740 --> 40:50.780
That's where you need to hit.

40:50.780 --> 40:54.660
Do you know if there's any AI stuff like computer vision,

40:54.660 --> 40:58.540
like where there's cameras and they help you target

40:58.540 --> 41:02.420
using all different kinds of cameras to see through,

41:03.260 --> 41:04.100
like the fog, all those kinds of things.

41:04.100 --> 41:08.500
No, we used the FU, which are Forward Observation Officers,

41:08.500 --> 41:10.580
which are an artillery individual

41:10.580 --> 41:14.140
that is embedded with an infantry unit.

41:14.140 --> 41:14.980
Oh wow, okay.

41:14.980 --> 41:18.060
They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates

41:18.060 --> 41:20.540
and basically say like, don't drop this on us.

41:20.540 --> 41:21.380
Got it.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.940
So you know which parts not to shoot.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.780
Correct.

41:24.780 --> 41:25.620
And then, the rest.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.260
So that means no one moves.

41:27.260 --> 41:29.420
Don't move, stay still.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.740
But you can hear it coming.

41:30.740 --> 41:31.580
Yeah.

41:31.580 --> 41:32.820
You can't hear it until it's too close.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.180
So like when I went, sorry, go ahead.

41:34.180 --> 41:35.020
You were gonna say something.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.860
No, I was gonna say, what's the experience on the other?

41:38.860 --> 41:42.300
Like what does it feel like to be maybe infantry or-

41:42.300 --> 41:43.140
Underneath it?

41:43.140 --> 41:45.020
Underneath the artillery.

41:45.020 --> 41:48.620
Well, I had the rare opportunity to do that

41:48.620 --> 41:50.860
and I have a video I'll show you after.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.620
It's terrifying.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.540
Cause I know the people that are shooting it

41:56.540 --> 41:57.640
and I know them personally

41:57.640 --> 41:59.060
and I know what they're like as humans

41:59.060 --> 42:01.020
and for the most part, they're dialed.

42:01.020 --> 42:02.340
So you get the odd duck where you're like,

42:02.340 --> 42:03.940
I've seen people have an ND,

42:03.940 --> 42:06.660
which is a negligent discharge.

42:06.660 --> 42:07.980
You basically get charged for it.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.060
You're getting a lot of trouble

42:09.060 --> 42:10.580
cause you can blow people up.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.660
And like accidents happen.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.700
And so I know accidents can happen in stressful situations.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.500
And when I was with the Brits,

42:17.500 --> 42:19.880
we had to call danger, close artillery.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.940
And when it goes over top of you,

42:21.940 --> 42:23.580
it sounds like thunder and lightning.

42:23.580 --> 42:27.500
So you fire it and it's not the stereotype

42:27.500 --> 42:28.620
that you hear in World War II

42:28.660 --> 42:29.900
where it kind of like that.

42:29.900 --> 42:33.980
It's more of like a crackle.

42:33.980 --> 42:35.940
And then you just hear like a whiz

42:35.940 --> 42:38.880
and it just goes everywhere.

42:38.880 --> 42:39.940
It's loud.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.340
It shakes the ground.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.600
It shakes you.

42:42.600 --> 42:43.440
You feel it.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.260
Okay.

42:46.260 --> 42:49.620
Is there some more words you can put to like the experience

42:49.620 --> 42:53.700
of what it's like to be in the heat of battle there?

42:53.700 --> 42:57.220
So what is, is there literally, is it hot?

42:57.740 --> 42:59.540
Are you talking about being under it or shooting it?

42:59.540 --> 43:00.380
Under it.

43:00.380 --> 43:01.220
Oh yeah.

43:01.220 --> 43:02.780
It 55 degree heat.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.860
You know that you're waiting for it to be called.

43:04.860 --> 43:08.000
You feel an overwhelming excitement to start

43:08.000 --> 43:10.100
because for me, I'd never been under it.

43:10.100 --> 43:12.660
So I was like, okay, I had my camera ready.

43:12.660 --> 43:14.220
Like I was a kid at a candy store

43:14.220 --> 43:16.340
and I'm like, I want to watch this happen.

43:16.340 --> 43:21.380
And once you hear the crackle, I got really fearful.

43:21.380 --> 43:24.820
My anxiety kicked up significantly.

43:25.340 --> 43:28.860
I got to the point where I got numb.

43:28.860 --> 43:31.660
Like I was, my nerves were on overdrive so much

43:31.660 --> 43:33.500
that like my body would go like numb.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.580
Like I could move, but like my nerves were numb,

43:35.580 --> 43:36.420
if that makes sense.

43:36.420 --> 43:38.180
What were the nerves like?

43:38.180 --> 43:42.060
Are we talking about fear or is it just anxious excitement?

43:42.060 --> 43:43.340
Anxious excitement,

43:43.340 --> 43:45.580
hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on us.

43:45.580 --> 43:50.580
And there was this excitement that's hard to describe

43:51.420 --> 43:53.460
because you don't want to be excited

43:53.460 --> 43:55.820
that you're dropping bombs on people.

43:55.820 --> 43:57.300
But when you just saw their faces

43:57.300 --> 43:58.780
and they're shooting at you,

43:58.780 --> 44:03.060
there's this overwhelming feeling of got you motherfucker.

44:03.060 --> 44:03.900
Yeah.

44:03.900 --> 44:05.020
Yeah.

44:05.020 --> 44:05.980
Well, we'll talk about that

44:05.980 --> 44:10.340
because that's such a difficult thing about wars.

44:10.340 --> 44:12.700
You forget that it's other human beings.

44:12.700 --> 44:13.540
Yeah, you do.

44:13.540 --> 44:14.580
Because those other human beings

44:14.580 --> 44:16.860
are doing really bad things to you.

44:16.860 --> 44:20.240
And so the very basic anger takes over,

44:21.080 --> 44:23.320
hate can take over.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.360
And then also just the excitement

44:25.360 --> 44:30.360
of almost like video game like aspect of war, like sport.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.760
It's like sport that all of those elements are all baked in.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.920
It's hard to be philosophical

44:37.920 --> 44:40.000
in that situation that seems like.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.280
I've never played video games,

44:41.280 --> 44:43.000
so I can't compare it to that.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.160
But like from like a sports perspective,

44:45.160 --> 44:46.520
yeah, I could argue that.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.960
Like I felt like we won there for a second

44:49.000 --> 44:52.360
and it's not just like a heat from outside.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.800
It's like this radiation within you

44:54.800 --> 44:57.120
that is something I've never felt since.

44:59.680 --> 45:03.480
You just to take a small step back to the weapons training.

45:03.480 --> 45:06.120
What kind of guns did you train on?

45:06.120 --> 45:08.640
Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.360
I love Carl Gustavs.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.200
What are those?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.800
What are those Carl G's?

45:12.800 --> 45:14.000
Carl G's.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
What's that?

45:15.000 --> 45:16.480
What's the like?

45:16.480 --> 45:18.280
My only experience with the rocket launch

45:18.320 --> 45:21.040
is from the movie Commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.000
Oh yeah, and we've all discussed.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.600
I haven't seen that yet and I've heard about it

45:23.600 --> 45:24.680
and people have made me tell.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.520
Yeah, I know.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.200
I feel like you haven't seen a single movie

45:27.200 --> 45:30.160
that's relevant to war military

45:30.160 --> 45:31.800
because every time anyone brings it up,

45:31.800 --> 45:33.560
you say you haven't seen it.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.040
I don't have time to watch movies, Lex.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.640
Platoon, you haven't seen Platoon, which is.

45:37.640 --> 45:38.600
You're the scientist.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.320
How do you have the time?

45:40.320 --> 45:41.280
I'm not a scientist.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.600
I just play one on TV.

45:43.600 --> 45:44.480
Okay. Sure.

45:44.480 --> 45:48.240
So what, can you talk about the rocket launcher

45:49.200 --> 45:50.040
and maybe any other.

45:50.040 --> 45:50.880
Yeah.

45:50.880 --> 45:51.720
For both engineering, actually.

45:51.720 --> 45:53.400
To me, those guns are very interesting

45:53.400 --> 45:55.280
from an engineering perspective too.

45:55.280 --> 45:56.120
Well, they should be.

45:56.120 --> 45:57.800
They're fascinating when you take them apart

45:57.800 --> 46:00.200
and you see how small the parts get down to

46:00.200 --> 46:03.000
and how necessary every single little piece is

46:03.000 --> 46:03.880
to make that thing run.

46:03.880 --> 46:06.200
And even without the tiniest little BB,

46:06.200 --> 46:07.760
smaller than a piece on there,

46:07.760 --> 46:10.200
an artillery gun might not run.

46:10.200 --> 46:14.800
So we were trained on Carl G's and called M72's,

46:14.800 --> 46:17.720
which are disposable rocket launchers.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.920
So back up, Carl G's are around,

46:20.920 --> 46:23.640
I don't know the exact millimeter of the round.

46:23.640 --> 46:24.760
It's been a while since I shot them.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.560
We only did those in training,

46:26.560 --> 46:28.920
but essentially it takes most people,

46:28.920 --> 46:30.840
one person can fire it,

46:30.840 --> 46:32.640
effectively hold it and fire it.

46:32.640 --> 46:34.720
It takes another person to load it.

46:34.720 --> 46:36.880
So you put it onto your shoulder and it weighs,

46:36.880 --> 46:39.760
I would, I don't know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.600
Oh wow.

46:40.600 --> 46:41.440
I can't remember.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.280
It's been a minute.

46:42.280 --> 46:43.100
It's been a minute.

46:43.100 --> 46:43.940
But one person can carry it.

46:43.940 --> 46:45.040
Oh yeah.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.520
Okay.

46:46.520 --> 46:47.360
I don't know.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.560
It just seems like a rocket launcher

46:49.560 --> 46:53.880
is a pretty intense kind of device that just.

46:53.880 --> 46:54.720
For sure is.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.640
I mean, it's the diameter.

46:56.640 --> 46:57.960
I can't even tell you the diameter.

46:57.960 --> 46:58.800
They're about that big.

46:58.800 --> 46:59.800
I mean.

46:59.800 --> 47:00.880
And it goes on your shoulder.

47:00.880 --> 47:02.360
It goes on your shoulder.

47:02.360 --> 47:04.440
And then it has a little sight that pops out

47:04.440 --> 47:05.720
that's almost like plastic-like,

47:05.720 --> 47:07.240
which is kind of funny because it reminds me

47:07.240 --> 47:11.200
of like the little green army men.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.240
I just felt so flimsy to me.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.120
I was like, this is hilarious.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.640
And then another person stands behind you

47:16.680 --> 47:17.520
and opens the hatch.

47:17.520 --> 47:21.840
And so there's this, there's these two levers

47:21.840 --> 47:23.000
and you just kind of open it.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.040
And then the backend, which is flared.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.120
So it's just a tube and then it's flared.

47:28.120 --> 47:29.760
That will open it and drop down

47:29.760 --> 47:31.440
and you load a round into that.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.880
And then you load it back up.

47:32.880 --> 47:33.880
Got it.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.640
And you're never supposed to stand behind it

47:35.640 --> 47:37.920
because the blast behind it will kill you.

47:37.920 --> 47:40.040
It's, yeah.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.280
But in my case, when I fired it,

47:43.160 --> 47:45.560
it was me and another individual.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.160
It wasn't Sarah Pellegrin,

47:47.160 --> 47:49.480
but it was another girl that was smaller.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.360
And the person is supposed to wrap around your waist

47:52.360 --> 47:54.080
and tuck low and hold your stability.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.720
And we were just aiming at tanks that day.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.200
And they were just concrete heads.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.440
So they would just either,

47:59.440 --> 48:02.400
they would hit and bounce off or whatever.

48:02.400 --> 48:05.000
And so when my sergeant saw that,

48:05.000 --> 48:07.480
he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,

48:07.480 --> 48:08.880
no, I'm just gonna.

48:08.880 --> 48:13.120
And he got real low and just like wrapped both of us.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.520
And then we'd fire it.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.160
And it feels like you're getting punched

48:17.160 --> 48:20.000
in the side of the head on repeat by Jocko.

48:20.000 --> 48:20.840
Yeah.

48:20.840 --> 48:22.680
It, you lose all your hearing.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.920
Like just, snot comes out of your nose

48:26.920 --> 48:29.640
and you're just kind of discombobulated for a minute.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.360
It's a real mind fuck.

48:32.360 --> 48:37.360
Is there any other kind of guns that at that time,

48:38.320 --> 48:39.480
because you were new to this,

48:39.480 --> 48:41.720
you haven't shot guns when you were younger

48:41.720 --> 48:44.440
that were really impressive to you in the training process?

48:45.360 --> 48:46.680
Yeah, I've never fired a weapon.

48:46.680 --> 48:50.160
So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe,

48:51.520 --> 48:52.520
the long barrel.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.520
The cute thing about those is when I have that slung,

48:54.520 --> 48:56.040
my barrel drags on the ground.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.920
So that's fun.

48:58.920 --> 49:02.680
And they shoot your 7.62 or your 5.56 round.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
I loved that.

49:03.680 --> 49:06.600
I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel,

49:06.600 --> 49:08.760
which is what the SF guys use.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.600
Not because it's cooler looking, which it obviously is,

49:11.600 --> 49:14.640
but because it was functional for my body height

49:14.640 --> 49:16.880
and it didn't drag on the ground when I ran.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.400
I loved those.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.800
Your personal weapon, being an artillery gunner,

49:20.800 --> 49:22.560
if you're not an officer, at least in our unit,

49:22.560 --> 49:25.320
you didn't get a side piece.

49:25.320 --> 49:27.600
I didn't have a side piece, Lex.

49:27.600 --> 49:30.840
So I never had a handgun of any type.

49:30.840 --> 49:31.960
I fired those in training.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.280
You can't get over that side piece comment.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.120
Look at you.

49:35.000 --> 49:36.880
I was gonna say, I know what a side piece is.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.000
You don't have to explain to me.

49:38.000 --> 49:38.840
But you're single.

49:38.840 --> 49:40.040
So how do you even have a side piece

49:40.040 --> 49:41.080
if you don't have a main piece?

49:41.640 --> 49:44.640
The joke would be the fact that we have a total

49:44.640 --> 49:46.120
misunderstanding what a side piece is.

49:46.120 --> 49:46.960
Okay, great.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.000
So you didn't have a side piece as a non-officer.

49:49.000 --> 49:49.840
Right.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.080
So I never fired those much.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.840
We did grenades in training.

49:52.840 --> 49:53.680
Oh, cool.

49:53.680 --> 49:54.500
Yeah, grenades are fun.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.340
I love grenades.

49:55.340 --> 49:56.880
I have a massive one tattooed on me.

49:56.880 --> 49:58.640
I have them all over my office.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.320
How does a grenade work?

50:00.320 --> 50:02.200
There's the spoon and the pin.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.760
So the pin holds the spoon in place.

50:04.760 --> 50:08.520
When you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside,

50:08.560 --> 50:12.120
as long as the spoon is up against it, it won't fire.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.600
As soon as that spoon goes,

50:13.600 --> 50:16.720
I believe it causes a reaction on the inside

50:16.720 --> 50:18.400
and you've got about five seconds to check it.

50:18.400 --> 50:21.000
You'd be better to ask that question too.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.480
I don't want me to get philosophical on this.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.320
No, you're not.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.720
But there's something about a grenade

50:25.720 --> 50:27.920
because you're essentially committing suicide

50:29.880 --> 50:32.280
unless you get rid of the thing.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.320
There's something like-

50:33.320 --> 50:35.080
Or if you're unlucky and it just goes off

50:35.080 --> 50:35.920
when you pull the pin,

50:35.920 --> 50:37.880
which has happened to tons of people.

50:37.880 --> 50:40.440
So it just feels like a very kind of,

50:40.440 --> 50:44.080
it's a dangerous leap into the abyss

50:44.080 --> 50:45.840
every time you use the thing.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.200
Because when you shoot a gun,

50:47.200 --> 50:49.720
the gun is much less likely to malfunction

50:49.720 --> 50:52.440
in terms of all the possible ways it can go wrong.

50:52.440 --> 50:55.040
It just seems like grenade is like-

50:55.040 --> 50:55.920
Primitive almost.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.440
Yeah, it's primitive.

50:57.440 --> 51:00.960
It's also real in a way that a bar fight,

51:00.960 --> 51:02.680
being punched in the face is real.

51:02.680 --> 51:05.820
It's like you're here with a weapon of destruction.

51:05.820 --> 51:07.720
It's just you and the thing.

51:08.560 --> 51:09.400
You have to get rid of it.

51:09.400 --> 51:10.240
I don't know.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.560
Is that terrifying to you?

51:11.560 --> 51:13.880
Do people still use grenades in warfare?

51:13.880 --> 51:15.160
Oh yeah.

51:15.160 --> 51:16.080
Yeah, those are fantastic.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.120
The Taliban were throwing them over the wall

51:18.120 --> 51:19.920
at the airport in Kabul.

51:19.920 --> 51:20.880
People use them all the time.

51:20.880 --> 51:22.120
Because when you're in Afghanistan,

51:22.120 --> 51:23.160
if you're in a rural area,

51:23.160 --> 51:24.400
you're going from village to village

51:24.400 --> 51:27.120
and they're mud hut walls.

51:27.120 --> 51:29.240
They're tall, but you're walking through corridors and stuff.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.240
All you gotta lob one of those,

51:31.240 --> 51:33.760
it's gonna take the whole unit out that just walked by.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.440
They're accurate if you're close enough

51:36.440 --> 51:38.680
and they're effective if you're close enough.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.680
I love them though.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.320
I think they're fascinating to me

51:44.320 --> 51:47.200
because they're such a tiny little thing

51:47.200 --> 51:49.320
with such devastation.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.120
They just can cause such devastation.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.720
But for me, when I had them,

51:53.920 --> 51:55.280
some of the Canadians would make fun of me

51:55.280 --> 51:57.100
because when I did go outside the wire with the British,

51:57.100 --> 51:58.900
I had two right here.

51:58.900 --> 52:02.740
And I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons

52:02.740 --> 52:04.120
because in my mind,

52:04.120 --> 52:06.440
I could picture myself searching someone

52:06.440 --> 52:08.520
and grabbing me and pulling that.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.320
And that would be me.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.800
That would have been like, yep,

52:11.800 --> 52:13.800
if anyone that was gonna happen to,

52:13.800 --> 52:15.520
it was her for sure.

52:15.520 --> 52:20.080
So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009.

52:20.080 --> 52:20.920
Okay.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.760
And like we said, you were in great,

52:23.760 --> 52:26.080
no, perfect physical shape.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.320
Fucking epic shape.

52:27.320 --> 52:31.320
Epic shape, six pack or I mean, okay.

52:31.320 --> 52:36.320
So you could do a lot of pull-ups and push-ups and okay.

52:37.520 --> 52:39.400
And well-trained, would you say?

52:39.400 --> 52:40.880
Were you already what like?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.020
No.

52:42.020 --> 52:42.860
No.

52:42.860 --> 52:43.680
No.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.840
I'll argue that point till I'm blue in the face.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.820
I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my sergeant.

52:47.820 --> 52:50.120
He's not a sergeant anymore, but Sergeant Marc LeBlanc,

52:50.120 --> 52:51.720
he's in Africa right now on a deployment.

52:51.720 --> 52:52.680
He gave me a call the other day

52:52.680 --> 52:54.440
and I remember talking to him about this.

52:54.440 --> 52:58.720
And it's frustrating because we were at an active war.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.680
We were, sorry, we were involved in an active war

53:00.680 --> 53:04.100
where the units that I were in were tagged red,

53:04.100 --> 53:07.280
which meant they needed people.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.860
So when you need people, things go quick.

53:10.860 --> 53:12.560
Whether or not that's right.

53:12.560 --> 53:14.800
I mean, you could argue that's the similar thing

53:14.800 --> 53:16.420
to what's happening in the world right now.

53:16.420 --> 53:18.000
We needed a vaccine.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.780
We got a vaccine.

53:19.780 --> 53:21.480
Is it the best it could be?

53:21.480 --> 53:22.800
Could it be better?

53:22.800 --> 53:24.060
Could it do more things?

53:24.060 --> 53:25.320
Sure, probably.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.120
But with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.960
That's my logic on that.

53:30.960 --> 53:35.480
For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.

53:35.480 --> 53:38.840
I was in basic training in January of 2008.

53:38.840 --> 53:41.440
I was graduated basic SQ,

53:41.440 --> 53:43.000
which is all your weapons training,

53:43.000 --> 53:47.440
your DP-1, which is your trade specific training.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.540
So whatever trade you're gonna go into,

53:49.540 --> 53:52.480
whether it's infantry, armored, artillery, medic, whatever,

53:52.480 --> 53:54.060
that's your DP-1.

53:54.060 --> 53:56.320
It's called different things in different units.

53:56.360 --> 54:00.300
And then I got posted to my unit in September.

54:00.300 --> 54:03.240
So January to September, I had done all my training

54:03.240 --> 54:05.840
and I'm an English speaking individual.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.960
I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French

54:08.960 --> 54:11.860
and had to learn all of the weapon systems,

54:11.860 --> 54:13.800
everything again that I just learned

54:13.800 --> 54:15.600
in that short timeframe in French.

54:15.600 --> 54:19.160
This part of your story that you're telling us to Jaco

54:19.160 --> 54:22.600
is one way to say it is very impressive

54:22.600 --> 54:24.840
that you had to learn all of this in French.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.800
There's also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it,

54:27.800 --> 54:29.000
which is difficult probably.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.160
It didn't have any, yeah, it didn't have any.

54:32.160 --> 54:34.540
But it's also make you a more effective soldier

54:34.540 --> 54:39.160
to be socially, for that cohesion to be there, right?

54:39.160 --> 54:43.620
But also just understanding the basic terminology.

54:43.620 --> 54:46.180
Correct, the right way to say something on the radio,

54:46.180 --> 54:48.920
the right way to run a gun, the right way to,

54:48.920 --> 54:50.160
because you gotta move with those guns,

54:50.160 --> 54:53.760
you got seven people, it's really magical.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.640
I'll send you a video when we did some live fire

54:57.640 --> 54:59.560
in workup training in Texas before we left,

54:59.560 --> 55:01.140
we did a competition between the other gun

55:01.140 --> 55:03.520
to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.

55:05.520 --> 55:10.400
It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun

55:10.400 --> 55:12.560
because it's like a symphony.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.780
Everyone has their parts and everyone knows

55:14.780 --> 55:17.280
and everyone's yelling, but they know why they're yelling

55:17.280 --> 55:19.600
and everyone, this guy's gotta do this

55:19.600 --> 55:21.240
in order for this guy to load the round.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.880
It's just, it's beautiful, it really is.

55:23.880 --> 55:26.560
It is gorgeous to watch, I miss it deeply.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.280
Is there, by the way, for a gun,

55:28.280 --> 55:31.800
is there like one person responsible for the aim

55:31.800 --> 55:34.920
and the, or like the specification of the location

55:34.920 --> 55:37.760
and somebody else that pulls it, presses the button?

55:37.760 --> 55:38.660
The lanyard.

55:38.660 --> 55:39.760
Is that the lanyard?

55:39.760 --> 55:40.600
Is there a button?

55:40.600 --> 55:42.520
It's better than a button, you'll like it,

55:42.520 --> 55:43.400
I'll tell you in a second.

55:43.400 --> 55:45.080
Okay.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.840
There's your sergeant in charge

55:46.840 --> 55:48.880
and then they have their two IC.

55:48.880 --> 55:52.200
And so the comms come in to the sergeant

55:52.200 --> 55:55.760
and the sergeant is the, or your master bombardier,

55:55.760 --> 55:56.680
bombardier chef.

55:58.040 --> 55:58.880
Yeah.

55:58.880 --> 55:59.720
Sorry, what?

55:59.720 --> 56:01.440
Bombardier chef, what?

56:01.440 --> 56:02.880
Bombardier chef.

56:02.880 --> 56:04.760
Bombardier chef, oh, that's the French.

56:04.760 --> 56:06.160
Master bombardier.

56:06.160 --> 56:09.320
So it goes like private in the North,

56:09.320 --> 56:10.920
like in infantry or in a regular unit,

56:10.920 --> 56:15.160
it's like private corporal, master corporal sergeant.

56:15.160 --> 56:18.860
In artillery, it goes gunner, bombardier,

56:18.900 --> 56:22.580
master bombardier, sergeant, and off like that.

56:22.580 --> 56:25.860
So you have two people, but the serge is like,

56:25.860 --> 56:27.420
you don't move till he says move,

56:27.420 --> 56:30.140
you don't fire till he says fire, like he's your guy,

56:30.140 --> 56:30.980
he'll give you the coordinates,

56:30.980 --> 56:34.100
he'll feed them to the guy that's doing the GPS,

56:34.100 --> 56:36.180
that portion, I really never did it much,

56:36.180 --> 56:38.220
I wasn't tall enough to see it.

56:38.220 --> 56:40.560
Like legitimately, how high it is up on the gun,

56:40.560 --> 56:43.180
like it was, I couldn't see clearly enough,

56:43.180 --> 56:45.140
it was not good, so.

56:45.140 --> 56:46.940
Obviously you have a big personality,

56:46.940 --> 56:48.020
you're a strong person.

56:48.020 --> 56:49.500
I don't say.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.900
And you have a big hat currently.

56:51.900 --> 56:53.380
I always wear a hat, Lex.

56:53.380 --> 56:55.820
You always, okay, it seems like your height

56:55.820 --> 56:57.980
and your size was a factor.

56:57.980 --> 56:58.820
Oh, for sure.

56:58.820 --> 57:00.820
How were you able to step up in all those moments,

57:00.820 --> 57:03.740
and how difficult was it?

57:04.620 --> 57:06.340
I don't know that I realized it was difficult

57:06.340 --> 57:08.660
while I was doing it, because that's just the way it's been.

57:08.660 --> 57:11.380
I've always been the short person, that's life,

57:11.380 --> 57:12.540
nothing I can do to fix that.

57:12.540 --> 57:14.420
So there was no point, when am I gonna whine about it?

57:14.420 --> 57:16.780
I'm gonna break my femurs and insert things

57:16.780 --> 57:17.660
to make me grow a little bit.

57:17.660 --> 57:20.340
Maybe, maybe since you're in robotics,

57:20.340 --> 57:21.540
you can figure that out.

57:21.540 --> 57:22.380
Okay.

57:22.380 --> 57:24.260
That's your task now.

57:24.260 --> 57:26.920
Make me be five foot three, that'd be great.

57:28.460 --> 57:31.380
For artillery, really what it came down to

57:31.380 --> 57:33.340
was the unit when I got there,

57:33.340 --> 57:34.500
there was only a couple of people

57:34.500 --> 57:36.620
who spoke any sort of English,

57:36.620 --> 57:38.800
and my sergeant was not one of them.

57:38.800 --> 57:41.840
But once he kind of started to get to know me a little bit,

57:41.840 --> 57:45.280
the best that he could, he started to put effort

57:45.280 --> 57:48.080
into making sure I could lift the rounds,

57:48.080 --> 57:51.700
make sure my capacity to do my job was there.

57:51.700 --> 57:54.240
And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.840
So he would take me to the gym with him,

57:56.840 --> 57:59.840
and he would show me exercises

57:59.840 --> 58:03.720
that would specifically help me load the rounds.

58:03.720 --> 58:05.680
So pick the round up from the ground,

58:05.680 --> 58:08.200
pick it up like a trick to put your knee under it,

58:08.200 --> 58:09.200
use your legs.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.200
Instead of just pick it up, use your back,

58:11.200 --> 58:13.760
pull your back out, he would work on that.

58:13.760 --> 58:15.200
And then depending on the position

58:15.200 --> 58:16.700
I was running the gun in,

58:16.700 --> 58:20.800
if I was running the side that had the charge bags,

58:20.800 --> 58:22.060
I'll explain that in a second.

58:22.060 --> 58:25.060
But if I was running the side that had the charge bags,

58:25.060 --> 58:28.920
I could step up onto the gun,

58:28.920 --> 58:31.480
and if I leaned inward enough

58:31.480 --> 58:33.180
with my right hand with the charge,

58:33.180 --> 58:35.860
and I kind of kicked off,

58:35.860 --> 58:40.200
I could kind of jump and shove it up the tube.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.600
Got it.

58:41.600 --> 58:42.920
Almost enough, yeah.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.160
If I was running the lanyard,

58:44.160 --> 58:46.560
which is the thing that makes it go boom,

58:46.560 --> 58:49.080
it's really easy, it's a long rope.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.520
You hook it on, and you put it,

58:51.520 --> 58:53.240
your right hand on your hip and on your left,

58:53.240 --> 58:54.400
and you hold it there,

58:54.400 --> 58:56.440
and you just stare at your sergeant like this,

58:56.440 --> 58:58.400
and you just wait for him to yell fire.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.880
And he points at you when he does it,

58:59.880 --> 59:03.240
and when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.

59:03.240 --> 59:04.940
And when you do that,

59:04.940 --> 59:08.120
it alleviates the misfire essentially,

59:08.120 --> 59:09.120
because if you just pull it,

59:09.120 --> 59:10.240
sometimes that's not enough,

59:10.240 --> 59:12.640
you gotta really give it your whole body into it.

59:13.400 --> 59:17.480
And so he would train me on how to do things differently

59:17.480 --> 59:19.480
so that I could do them effectively,

59:19.480 --> 59:20.880
and I wasn't a ship pump.

59:20.880 --> 59:22.760
A what?

59:22.760 --> 59:25.480
So ship pump is a term that we use in Canada

59:25.480 --> 59:27.000
to call somebody useless.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.880
A ship pump is a useless soldier who is just,

59:30.880 --> 59:32.680
you're there, and that's the ship pump,

59:32.680 --> 59:34.560
and so we all just deal with it,

59:34.560 --> 59:36.840
but somehow they're still there.

59:36.840 --> 59:39.440
Yeah, what were we talking about, the lanyard, okay.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.960
Yeah, we were talking about the artillery guns.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.920
Those things though, what you would find fascinating

59:44.920 --> 59:48.000
is just how they break down

59:48.000 --> 59:49.560
when you have to take one of those apart.

59:49.560 --> 59:53.200
I think your mind would really find it fascinating

59:53.200 --> 59:54.880
how a breach comes apart

59:54.880 --> 59:57.600
all the way down to like ball bearing size.

59:57.600 --> 59:59.640
And there's a way to just make that gun

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.300
completely ineffective, and all you have to do

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.020
when you're on the charge side,

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.140
there's a magazine that's a long linear magazine,

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.600
and it holds like 15 little rounds.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.320
If you just take that thing out,

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.000
nothing's not firing.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.920
How many people does it take to move that?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.400
How easy is it to move that thing?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.880
To move a 777?

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.080
A 777, I like it.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:21.760
Well, that's what they're called, M777s.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.160
Is a lot of the terminology

01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.880
cross over the same in English and French?

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.600
No. Okay.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.640
I mean, M777 does, because it's an obvious howitzer,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.560
I'm sure it has a separate word,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.440
but if you're running it, you're running it in French.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:37.000
So when I'm doing the charge bags,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.480
and I'm doing, you know, I'm loading everything

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.320
and I'm getting that ready,

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.960
and that's my position that day,

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.640
I'm also controlling the breach.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.240
So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.800
And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.640
So you're yelling like,

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640
Mes lib, coulas, au reveil.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.480
Like you have to yell all these things.

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.040
You have to learn them though.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:04.040
And so for a long time, it was a little frustrating.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.140
I won't lie.

01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:05.980
It was really exciting.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.060
I know a lot of French, but I forgot all of it.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:10.700
But I think it's a beautiful, romantic language.

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:11.740
It's a good language.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.340
If it's from Quebec, is it?

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:14.540
Yeah, that's true.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.100
It's a good language to fall in love with.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.100
Not as good as Russian, but English is, all right.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.220
I mean, Russian, is that like a love language?

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.260
It is to me.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.220
I mean, because you're Russian,

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.540
but like if somebody walked up to me and was like,

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:30.500
hey, Kelsey, I like you.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.940
I'd be like, oh God, he's gonna put me in a camp.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.380
That's because you don't understand love, Kelsey.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:37.260
We'll talk about that, okay.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.100
How many people does it take to move the M777?

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:40.920
It depends.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.020
If you're moving it by ground, you're moving it on a truck.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:44.420
And when you're moving it on a truck,

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.620
you're hooking the back of it onto,

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:47.780
you're hooking the front of the barrel

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.140
onto one of those big transport looking trucks

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:53.940
that has those cargo tents that's got soldiers in it.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.140
You don't wanna ever move an M777 by that way

01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:56.980
if you don't have to.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.480
The barrel's worth a million dollars.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.320
Wow.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.100
Okay, so this is like a serious piece of equipment.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:03.940
You don't wanna move them.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.500
When we got to Kandahar,

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.800
we were there for a couple of days.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.500
We got flown out to the fob we were gonna be at,

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.100
forward observation base.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.700
Kandahar is the safe space

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.780
or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.740
There's things like Tim Horton's there.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.860
There's Canada House.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.180
There's a British side, an American side, a Canadian side.

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.900
And that's where you see all the different countries

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:26.940
in the world kind of come together.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.540
You would see Italians, you would see Germans,

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.040
you would see French,

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.580
you would see all these different uniforms

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.820
and you never know who to salute

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.020
because you don't know what each thing means.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.700
It doesn't feel like a war zone.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:37.540
No.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:38.380
Oh God, no.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.620
There's a boardwalk, there's hockey there,

01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:41.800
like floor hockey because Canada had to have that.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:46.940
There's a Tim Horton's a subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.800
I think there's a restaurant there somewhere,

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.700
but I never, I didn't get to go.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.920
You know, stuff like that.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.840
There's gyms, you can run around it.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.980
You feel fairly safe.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:55.820
You always have a weapon on you,

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:57.220
but you can live your life.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.580
When you get out to the fob, the guns were already there.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.180
So those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180
Normally, if they're going by air, they go by Chinook

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.700
because they're heavy as hell.

01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.100
And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:13.080
and they fly them and then they'll drop them down.

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.180
They have wheels on them,

01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:18.100
but you don't need them if you're going to leave it in place.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.180
Got it.

01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:21.620
And you're getting information about IEDs.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.380
You're getting a lay of the land

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.540
as to what's been going on in the country

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.260
for the past six months.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.460
And this, you know nothing.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.300
You're just like, this is your first time

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.140
you're getting deployed.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.980
What was your deployment like?

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:35.800
Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:37.980
Like the whole deployment?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.020
Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:43.500
What's the difference between the two?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.420
Well, actually getting ready to deploy

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:46.420
is a little different.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.660
So I mean, the emotional buildup to it

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.940
and some of the memorable things

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:55.820
that kind of you remember from that experience,

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:59.140
both on the excitement, I get to see battle,

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:02.260
I get to be part of this and the fear

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:04.780
and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:05.620
and all those kinds of things.

01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:07.140
So like the lead up before everything

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.140
like shit hit the fan?

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:09.140
Okay, cool.

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:09.980
So.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.660
You're such a fascinating person, but yes.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:14.580
Something like that.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:15.900
I've been called.

01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.980
Many things that start with the letter F.

01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:19.820
Yeah.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:20.660
No, I don't know.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.020
I don't know many words with the F.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.300
Okay, so with the buildup to the deployment.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.400
So for the buildup for the deployment,

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.520
I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.880
And at that time, you kind of get your marching orders,

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.760
you know you're deploying.

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.080
I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.880
That's how much they needed people.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:43.120
So once I did all that training on graduation parade day,

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.120
a couple men from Quebec in uniforms came over and said,

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.880
you, you, you and you are all being posted to Bakyatse

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.040
and you're gonna deploy with us in April.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.600
So that's how I found out I was deploying.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.520
Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.600
That was a well known thing

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.120
that there's a scaling up of troops.

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.760
2007 on Canada really started taking a combat role.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.760
Before it was very much more a UN type deal

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.720
where doing what we normally do in most wars

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.600
where we just, we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.840
And so we're there to help.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:15.840
And so they were really, they were scaling up

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.000
and there wasn't a lot of people in those trades initially,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.240
I think when the war kind of started.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.600
So Canada really started to scale.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.260
And so when I got to Quebec,

01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:26.780
we've kind of found, oh yeah, we're deploying.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.140
And it was a weird situation

01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.900
because I've never actually been at a unit

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:31.980
on a non-deployable unit.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.420
So I don't know what they do day to day

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.620
that's different from what I did.

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:36.380
I just know what I did.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.820
So we would do things like in the morning,

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.540
we would get up and we would meet for PT at 5 a.m.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.340
And that would include going for a 10K run

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:48.500
or playing ball hockey for a few hours in the gym

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.860
or lifting weights together

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:53.100
or just going on a rock march, a long rock march.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:54.380
Just stuff like that.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.780
You would have a shower, you would meet

01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:59.740
and then you would just sit around the regiment.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.180
You would just sit around the regiment

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.500
and you would, if there was busy work,

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.060
you'd mop the floors, you would clean weapons.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.780
There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.980
We did a lot for a while.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:15.060
And then we went away on workup training

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.180
to Texas for a week.

01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:20.300
We came down here and we did live fire

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:23.780
with our other troop that was gonna be with us.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:26.380
So Alpha had two guns

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.700
and two guns has two groups of people.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.700
And so we all would go down to Texas

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:33.780
and we did live fire here for a week.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.900
And I ended up getting gastro, which was awesome.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:38.740
So thanks for that.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.820
From?

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.140
Oh, apparently they were having water problems

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:43.060
and sanitary problems.

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:46.140
So everyone was getting it on the base.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:48.940
Okay, so it just makes your life way harder.

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.100
I didn't get it towards the end till towards the end.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.580
So that was fortunate.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.420
So we would fire, live fire.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:56.420
We would go out to the middle of nowhere.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.220
The guns would be there

01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.940
and we would get offload a truck of rounds

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.260
and we would do live fire and we would practice.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.620
Just constant practice.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.700
What's that saying?

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.420
Perfect practice makes perfect.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.820
Yeah, so this is a sensory,

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.660
like a shooting range for?

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.500
Artillery.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.340
For artillery.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.180
For long range.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.260
So what does practice look like?

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.820
So you roll up in your trucks

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:21.580
and you've got each group of people.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.780
You've got two trucks

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.260
and then you've got like a medic vehicle

01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.660
and then you've got like an officer vehicle

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:27.580
and a comms vehicle.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.300
And you go to your perspective guns

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.460
and then you offload your ammo

01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:34.340
and then you basically wait for them to send you

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:36.900
like a fire mission.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.260
Wow, get that together.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.300
They would call, they would say,

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.500
a mission sit, so it'd be a fire mission.

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.500
So we'd wait for that.

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:43.340
And once we got that,

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:46.300
then you all run like a bunch of scattered rats to the gun.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.100
Like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:50.620
And then you just wait,

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.500
you wait for the call for the sergeant to say,

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:53.540
and then you'll hear it,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.820
because it's not headphones.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.100
You can hear it on a speaker

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.020
and it'd be like,

01:07:58.020 --> 01:07:59.820
I'm not gonna do it in French, don't ask.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:00.660
It'd be like,

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.420
so-and-so, 10 rounds,

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.020
fire when ready.

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.260
And then you would get your rounds ready

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.100
and everyone would have them ready.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.340
Everyone would be in their respective positions.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.180
And then you would wait.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.860
And then they would say,

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:16.700
fire when ready.

01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.860
And as soon as they say fire when ready,

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.540
that means just start going.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.460
Just start.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.100
And then that's when the magic starts.

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:23.540
You go like the loop,

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.260
like you shoot one or whatever,

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:26.460
there's a reloading process.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:27.300
Yep, there's a loop.

01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:28.140
So what you would do,

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:28.960
you get the fire mission,

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.420
you would find out the rounds.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:32.060
The two IC would be standing by the rounds.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:34.460
And it was his job to make sure the amount of rounds

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.180
that was told would be the only rounds

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.620
that would go down range.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.980
And so he'd stand there.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.140
And on each round,

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.660
depending on the type of round is a fuse,

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:45.140
which gets screwed on to the top of the round.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.780
So they're about that big.

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:48.980
And it's just a point.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.740
And then you would have to put it on,

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.180
give it a spin.

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:55.380
And depending if it was a time release,

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:56.340
you had a little,

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.500
what do you call it?

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.180
You get those at Ikea when you have to build everything.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.020
Alan Rich?

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:01.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:02.680
Alan Rich.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.520
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.500
Yeah, but like a big one or something?

01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.340
No, just a little one.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.180
Cause there's a tiny little hole

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.020
and you just got to click it

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.740
to where it's supposed to go.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.900
And it depended on what the call was for.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:12.060
And it was a timer.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.260
When you said like wheel,

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.500
you mean like a little thing then?

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.580
Is that what we're talking about?

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:18.100
No, no, I'm talking about the round itself.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.460
So you would put a fuse on top of the round.

01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:21.980
So you would unload the ammo

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.340
and then you would put fuses on them.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:25.820
And the fuses are on the top

01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:28.460
and they're like a little like a ice cream topper

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:29.300
kind of thing.

01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:31.140
And you would spin those on.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:31.980
Oh, okay.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.180
And then once they're on,

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.860
depending if it's a time release or not,

01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860
you would take this little thing

01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:37.820
and you would move it, the top.

01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:39.740
And that would, it's almost like a little timer.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.660
Cool.

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.540
Yeah, it depended.

01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.100
So you're assembling a bullet.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:44.940
Essentially.

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:47.260
A very big one that goes up to my waist.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.100
Cool.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:48.940
Yeah.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:49.780
This is very cool.

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:50.660
And you're a fascinating person.

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:54.140
Okay, so just that you're still even years later

01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:55.780
have all this in your memory in some part.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:57.260
It's not all perfectly accurate.

01:09:57.260 --> 01:09:58.540
And that's what irritates me though,

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:00.420
is because it bothers me

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.140
when I can't remember things accurately.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.140
But I have a lot of,

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.100
I've had a lot of memory issues and problems

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.380
after like having too many hits to the head.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.220
And-

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:11.060
This is from earlier in childhood or later?

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.340
Both.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.180
Okay.

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:14.980
Both, the military did not help it.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.140
Where was the hits in the head in the military?

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.380
Well, when you have a Carl Gustaf

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:21.540
beside your face like this and it shoots around,

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.220
it gives you a concussive blast.

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.740
Also, there's new research being done.

01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:27.020
I'll find out exactly what it is,

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.340
but there's new research that's being done

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.740
that shows that if you're an artillery gunner

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:33.420
and you stand within a certain range of that gun,

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.300
you get the same amount of concussive blasts

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.220
and there's a range.

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.140
I had no idea, but you feel it when it goes off.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.100
Your whole body feels it.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:44.860
Your mind is fascinating

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.820
because it's like literally the opposite of mine.

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.860
One, you're able to speak very quickly,

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:50.300
very clearly, very sharply.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.260
Sorry, sorry.

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.420
No, what?

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.260
I talk too fast

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.100
and I'm pretty loud because of my hearing.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:54.940
No, that's perfect.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.500
I mean, I admire that very much.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.780
I can't do any of that.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.660
And you listen extremely well

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.380
and you're extremely attentive

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.420
and you have a good memory.

01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:04.740
So anyway, it's just fun to watch you

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:08.020
and I can tell you were a great soldier

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.820
in just all different aspects of it.

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:11.300
Thank you.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.140
Okay.

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:13.460
But what the heck were we talking about?

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:14.940
Oh, build up to the deployment.

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.300
How did we get to Texas?

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.300
Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.660
And live fire, you got to, did that feel good?

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:21.500
Oh yeah.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.340
Oh yeah.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:26.300
It's so good.

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.380
What's the favorite, what's the best part

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.260
about like shooting artillery?

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:35.260
Like what's the thing that feels good?

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.100
Which part?

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.940
Power.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.500
Well, the full, the feeling of power.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.020
When is the best moment of,

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.620
the highest moment of the feeling of power?

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:45.300
Is it the whole process that you love

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.460
or is there like when you actually shoot it?

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:49.420
It's symbiotic.

01:11:49.420 --> 01:11:50.820
It's a beautiful thing to watch.

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:53.620
To know that a gun can fire

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.380
and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.660
There's something about that to me

01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.780
that just got my heart racing.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.980
When you actually shoot the round

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.500
and you see it go and you hear it,

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.060
it's unlike, you can't describe.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:09.860
I've never felt another feeling.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.860
I've also never been in like an F-18 or an F-16

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:16.300
or like any, I've never been in anything like that.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:19.340
And I've, you know, I've never,

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.540
trying to think of something else that'd be comparable.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.300
I've never been in like a Formula One car.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.220
Those are the only things I can picture being

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.340
that much for me because to shoot one of those

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.100
and to know that you've done your job right

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.460
means that you've helped.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:37.740
And that to me was really what did it for me.

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.100
When you hear your sergeant say,

01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.820
mission accomplished, target hit, tired, acquired,

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.620
then you're like, that's a good feeling.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:46.900
That's the stuff.

01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.980
Quick pause.

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.060
Take a break, Lex.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:52.940
Okay, so live fire in Texas.

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.100
We're in Texas, by the way.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.780
Fort Worth or Fort Hood, one of them.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:58.140
Well, okay, so like it's,

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:59.980
is that close to a big major city?

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.060
Do you remember visiting a city?

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:04.900
Oh God, no, we fly right into the tarmac

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.220
and they're like, don't touch the snakes.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.700
And then they send you out to the field.

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.540
Got it.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.020
Must be the only instructions.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.620
No, really, we went into a classroom and they're like,

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.700
these are the animals that are in the wildlife in Texas.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.700
If you see any of them, do not approach.

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:19.940
Do not go pee outside.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.980
Do not squat down.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.140
It is snake season, people.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.420
And I was like, I have to pee and squat down.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:27.740
Why Texas and from like Canada,

01:13:27.740 --> 01:13:31.580
is it a simulation of Afghanistan?

01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:35.100
Okay, so you're getting,

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.020
and that's the way live fire was seen in artillery

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.860
is like you're trying to simulate certain aspects

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.980
of what you might actually see in Afghanistan.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:43.940
I would think so.

01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.180
I mean, it looks like it's hot,

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.100
like you're out in the middle of nowhere,

01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:51.620
very similar terrain.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.740
That's the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.420
and our tan, like our combat tan stuff

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.340
before you couldn't wear that.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:01.020
So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.020
how we were gonna be doing this,

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.060
what it was gonna look like,

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:04.300
how the guns were gonna work

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.460
and all of those lovely things.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:09.620
How do you go from there to being deployed?

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:12.140
What was the next part of the journey?

01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:14.860
So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta,

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.260
often called or referenced as Waincock

01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.620
because it sucks so bad.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.660
It is a massive open space in Alberta,

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.860
which most of Alberta is.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.980
And it's outside of a small town called Wainwright.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.340
And it is a field X training area

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:32.700
for all of the Canadian military.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.140
And it's where you do live fire,

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.060
but you also do workup training.

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:40.540
So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:41.900
I don't remember the exact time we were there

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:44.020
because it was just, you sleep in a tent,

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.380
you're in your cot, you're in like full mission mode

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:50.700
and you go outside and we did this operation

01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.740
called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.020
And you put on these little suits,

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.940
they have haptic, you can feel when you're shot.

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.940
And then there's a little camera,

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.020
sorry, screen in the front of it

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.780
and it's got button options.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.140
And so it's to mimic if you get shot,

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.900
it'll say gunshot wound and then you have to choose,

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.380
okay, do I do this or do I do this?

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:15.260
And depending on your response, person dies or lives.

01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:18.020
And they have other people who aren't on a rotation

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.020
for deployment come and act as the Taliban

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.700
and attack you in the middle of the night.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.580
Is there a good understanding of the tactics

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.540
that the Taliban used to attack?

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.180
I mean, this may be fast forwards

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:34.580
to our conversation a little bit,

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:39.060
but is there predictable strategies on the other side

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.300
that are being used in Afghanistan?

01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.140
By the Taliban?

01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:42.980
By the Taliban.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:43.820
Oh, 100%.

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.700
IEDs, suicide bombers, vehicle-borne IEDs.

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:52.380
Their standard way to hit people really was

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.020
IEDs and vehicle-borne IEDs, suicide bombers.

01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:59.580
They'd put like backpacks full of an IED

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:02.980
and then put like toys around it and then just be like.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:04.780
So they would conceal it in certain ways

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:06.060
and probably use civilians.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:07.580
Oh, 100%, yeah.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.700
And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers

01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.100
because women seem non-threatening.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.460
When you see a burka walk up to you,

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:16.740
you're not expecting an AK-47 to roll out of that and then,

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:20.340
or you know, but there are great ways to get close.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.700
Okay, so what is it?

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.540
Wayne something.

01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:23.380
Waynecock?

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.220
No, that's not how, Wayne Wright.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.060
Okay, correct.

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:27.380
So let's go to Alberta.

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.220
Okay.

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.060
Okay, so.

01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:29.900
I mean, we don't have to go to Alberta.

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:30.740
Nobody wants to.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:35.540
No, let's, in our minds, in our imagination.

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.940
So, okay, so that's getting you closer to Afghanistan.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.780
Right.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.620
What was that like?

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.300
I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.780
Is there a buildup?

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.620
What are you thinking?

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.100
Or is this just all part of the training?

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:47.900
For me, it was more part of the training.

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.820
I was excited to go because I did know

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.260
that we were going to do some live fire.

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.820
I did know that we were going to be doing more

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.740
of the military type job I thought we were going to be doing

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:01.420
because up until that point, I had just done training.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.260
So I was learning how to march and salute

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.820
and who to salute and not salute.

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.140
Like that was the focus of,

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.060
that was my experience of the military.

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:11.100
And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment,

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.300
just working out a lot and going for breakfast a lot

01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.140
and drinking.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.980
Like that was, so I was like, this is the army.

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.500
So when I actually got to go to Wainwright,

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.660
I got my first full taste of, okay, well,

01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:21.780
there's fire picket duty.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.300
So one person gets picked every night to do sentry.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:27.260
There's a little less sleep.

01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:29.700
You're eating out of a canteen now.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:30.540
You're drinking in a canteen.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.380
You're in your kit more.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.820
You're in your deployable kit.

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:36.820
Now you're in your, you're wearing your tack vest.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:39.220
You're getting ready to practice having plates on.

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.380
You're having ammunition on you.

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.980
You've got your weapon with you all the time.

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.140
When you're in your kit, you're in your kit.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:45.980
You're in your kit with you all the time.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.980
When you're on base in Veketsi in Quebec,

01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.180
you're just like an everyday job.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.780
Maybe you can paint a clearer picture to me.

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:55.220
When was there an understanding

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.460
that you're actually getting deployed?

01:17:56.460 --> 01:17:59.180
Was it just a sense that you're getting deployed

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.820
or was this officially told to you?

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:02.620
I was officially told on graduation day,

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.380
you're deploying in April with Veketsi.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.620
Oh, okay, there was a date.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:07.980
Like they knew.

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.380
So what had happened is the reason

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.500
that Veketsi unit needed more people.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.580
So they came to that and they picked five people.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.060
There was five English speaking people

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:16.980
that went to Veketsi.

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.940
It wasn't just myself.

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:19.700
There was a couple other people I knew

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.620
that were English speaking,

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.340
that got put on other guns within the regiment.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.780
I wasn't with any of them.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.860
We all kind of got split up.

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:30.340
And so there was an understanding

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:34.140
that we were going to always be deploying next year.

01:18:34.140 --> 01:18:35.900
It was like 2009, you're deploying.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.100
Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:41.220
because that was the rotation time.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.340
So each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:47.020
And then you knew right around that point,

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:50.260
another base of individuals would then deploy.

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.140
So you would go on these rotations.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.540
And so even when I was on my deployment then,

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:57.420
I was slated to go again the following year,

01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:59.140
but towards the end of the year.

01:18:59.140 --> 01:19:00.940
So there was always a rotation.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:02.780
If you were in a combat arms unit

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.460
and you were in one that was a deployable unit.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:08.180
So if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI,

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.260
which were the Princess Patricia's,

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.660
which were their infantry unit.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:15.340
If you were an RCR out of Pedawawa, Ontario,

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.340
you knew you were deploying.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.940
If you were at Vakutse, you knew you were deploying.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.380
There's combat arms bases,

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.100
and then there's like naval bases.

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.580
I didn't know their deployment structure.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.300
I didn't know how they worked.

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:26.140
I'm on the ground.

01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.380
Don't worry about the boats.

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.380
So I didn't know how the Air Force deployed.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:32.180
I knew Vakutse was deploying in April.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.980
You were going, get ready.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:36.900
That was that.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.900
So you show up to Afghanistan.

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.180
What is it a combat arms unit looks like?

01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:45.180
What's the situation look like?

01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.540
How much chaos is there?

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.300
How much clarity about mission is there?

01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:52.220
What are your feelings about the whole thing?

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.820
So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec.

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.540
We got driven to the airport

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:00.420
and then we walked onto the tarmac and we load our own bags.

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.140
Then we got on a plane and it's just empty.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:04.020
It's just, it's our plane, right?

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.140
And you don't go right to Afghanistan.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.900
You go to a stopover point,

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:09.260
which I don't know if I'm allowed to say

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.380
where that is, frankly.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.900
So I just say it's somewhere overseas and you go there

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:15.820
and you go there for a couple of days.

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:16.780
I think it's like a day or two.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.660
And that's where you get like your kit.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.020
That's where you get your bulletproof plates

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:21.300
for the first time and realize how heavy

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.620
those things are.

01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:25.500
It's where you get your weapon and your ammunition,

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:26.540
your first few mags.

01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.940
It's where you get your helmet and your vests

01:20:28.940 --> 01:20:31.180
and you get everything that you need.

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.660
While you're there, it's pretty nonchalant.

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.060
It's hot as hell.

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:37.180
It's your first time being in that kind of heat.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:38.860
So you just never stop sweating.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.380
The place we were in, it just,

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.660
the second you got out of the shower,

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:43.300
you were still wet after you got out.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.500
What the hell is happening?

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.020
It's so humid.

01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.820
And I'm like, is this gonna be like this in Afghanistan?

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:49.100
They're like, no, it's not humid there at all.

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.780
I'm like, why is this so bad here?

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.860
Like, it'll be fine, don't worry about it.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.500
So, and where we were there, it was kind of cute.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.340
We were like in a base within a base

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:05.340
and they had like turf and we had like ice cream and fruit

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.860
and you could go get on a computer,

01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:11.300
you could go make calls, you had showers, you had a real bed.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:14.420
It was very kind of okay for that point.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.820
And then you got all your stuff and then okay,

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:18.020
we're rolling out, which is about a five hour flight.

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:21.340
Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:24.140
from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, The Predator.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:29.660
I'm not, do you want me to say I've never seen it?

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:30.500
I've never seen it, Lex.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.660
You feel better about yourself?

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:36.500
You want to tell the audience all the excellent shows

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.780
that you mentioned me offline that you watch instead,

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.900
instead of Platoon?

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:40.740
Listen.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:44.380
Yeah, is Sex and the City, was that more important

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.220
than Platoon?

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:46.540
Oh no, I've never seen that.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.180
Don't put me in that category.

01:21:48.180 --> 01:21:49.660
Did you just put me in a box?

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:50.480
I did.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:53.540
I watched like Homeland, I watched, no, I watched like,

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.060
I watched a lot of documentaries, I watched,

01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.940
I like to watch real things more than just film.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:05.380
I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:07.940
and I was like, once you've seen how it's made,

01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:09.460
I'm like, I don't want to do that.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:11.740
Yeah, I mean, I'm the same with superhero movies.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:15.740
It doesn't, I want something closer to reality,

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.820
but then movies like Platoon reveal some deep aspect

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:21.260
of reality without it.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.220
I did Superman, Man of Steel.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:26.060
Wait, sorry, what do you mean you did?

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:30.420
I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert,

01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:32.180
even though I didn't actually have to do any stunts,

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.180
it's just because I had previous military experience

01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.540
and they were going to have me as an extra,

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.880
as a military person, but if you have previous experience,

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.460
they have to make it as like a stunt role,

01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.500
like so you get paid more.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.340
Got it.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:42.780
So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that,

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.540
I was in that like, you see me like,

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.620
for like two seconds.

01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.420
So what you're saying is you were the mastermind

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.240
behind that movie.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.740
For the entire thing.

01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:52.860
You're so accurate.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.220
Okay, great.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.460
Your representation of me is just fantastic.

01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:59.740
The Combat Arms Unit in Afghanistan,

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.100
the ice cream machine.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.620
What, like when you actually get closer

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.980
and closer to the mission, what, when does that happen?

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:09.780
When I, you know, got to where we were

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:11.660
before we were leaving to get on the plane,

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.180
I don't really, I don't think I realized

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.980
what the hell I was doing.

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:17.720
Truthfully, like you're asking me all these like,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.560
what did you feel?

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.500
How did you like, when I really think about it,

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:23.780
if I sit there and really think about it,

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:25.400
I was deploying, I was aware,

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.300
I knew what I was going to do, I knew my job,

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.180
but once we actually stepped onto that Herc to leave,

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.540
to get into the Afghan airspace,

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.620
I think that's when it hit me.

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:38.180
I think it smacked me in the face so hard.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:43.180
And that's when the overwhelming just reality was,

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:45.160
oh, fuck.

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:48.580
Oh, oh, oh.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:52.340
When they said, make weapons ready,

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:55.060
put the barrels to the ground, put your helmets on,

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:56.380
that's when they start flying tactically,

01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:58.080
which means they're going between the mountains.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:23:59.560
That means we're going to land soon,

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.280
which means if you're flying like this,

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:04.400
it's because RPGs can hit you.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.880
So that was my first moment of,

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.800
oh, I could like just be shot down right now.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.700
Like I couldn't, I didn't grasp it.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:14.320
I was, how old was I, 19?

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.800
19, yeah.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.440
Wow, okay.

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.560
So that's why I feel bad when I'm trying to explain to you

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.880
because it's hard because I don't know

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.680
that I actually did grasp it until I was in the air,

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.640
getting ready to land in Kandahar.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.240
When was the first time you heard bullets,

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.760
enemy bullets or enemy explosions?

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.120
Well, when you're in Kandahar, when you're at Ka'af,

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:39.600
there's a, you're fairly insulated away from the main walls.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:40.900
You would hear stuff go off

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.760
or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.720
So you would hear the,

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:47.920
and everyone just kind of got down on the ground

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.840
and just waited for the all clear and then got back up.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:55.080
I didn't hear any actual live fire

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.120
until I got to the FOB.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.320
It was more just a lot of noise.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.760
You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes

01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:04.160
going in and out of the base.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:05.120
So there was that sense,

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.240
you could feel the ground shake when they took off,

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:08.320
but there was that sense, you know,

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:10.240
things were going around, things were happening.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.560
You just weren't far enough.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:16.840
You were not close enough to the edges of Ka'af to see it.

01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:19.000
What's the FOB?

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.040
FOB is a forward observation base,

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:25.020
which is a small little base out in the middle of wherever.

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.740
And that's specific to artillery?

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:29.580
No.

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.900
That's in general just an observation base

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:32.740
from which combat-

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:34.580
For infantry to go in and out of,

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.700
for armor to go in and out of,

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.420
special ops go in and out of them.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.580
They fly, they'll stop there,

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.020
they'll pick people up or do whatever, then they'll go out.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:44.260
So it's a forward observation base is used essentially

01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.500
to have eyes in that area

01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.140
without having to be doing patrols every five seconds.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.860
But there's not, is it like, is there like medics there?

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.340
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, so it was-

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.180
Actual base?

01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:55.820
Yeah, I was, it's a, I don't call it an actual base.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.500
See, sleep in tents and cots.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.180
And it is, the walls are this mesh material

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:02.980
that are filled with gravel.

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.020
And that's the walls.

01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.820
And then you have towers.

01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:08.540
You had five, I think we had five towers

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:10.700
because the Americans ran four and we ran one.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:12.300
And so it was an American FOB.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.220
It's called FOB Ramrod.

01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:18.580
And there was a, were they Marines?

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.300
No, I think they were the 101st.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:21.900
They were out of there.

01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:24.500
This is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:25.980
So when people are like, who are you with?

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.140
I'm like, I know what their patches looked like.

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.780
I don't know the full ins and outs.

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.340
So I'm working on getting that back

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.740
so that I can tell it accurately

01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.700
because I believe it deserves that type of respect.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.740
But that being said, I'm still trying to wrap my brain

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.620
around all of this.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:44.780
Yeah, you almost have to go back and do like research

01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:46.380
to understand the full details

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:47.860
of all the things you were experiencing.

01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.740
And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people

01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:50.660
even before I wrote the book

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:51.780
and I didn't get a lot of answers.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.460
Well, once I did Jocko,

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.340
all the people have reached out to me and were like, hey.

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:56.620
And I'm like, called you.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.540
So now I'm working, that's why I'm doing the rewrite

01:26:58.540 --> 01:27:02.620
is I'm working on making sure that things are exact.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:05.700
And so there was infantry units going in and out of that FOB

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.180
and it was a really tiny FOB.

01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:10.780
It was run by the Americans.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.380
And then there was a tiny little corner

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:15.620
that was the Canadian Artillery Unit.

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:17.860
And the Americans normally,

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:19.340
it's Americans shooting for Americans,

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.780
Canadians shooting for Canadians.

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.260
The rest of the regiment that deployed,

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:25.940
so Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian FOBs,

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.340
Massimgard and another one.

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:29.100
And these were huge FOBs.

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:34.100
Ours was this tiny like three kilometer around place

01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:36.420
and we had this tiny little subsection of it

01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:37.820
and the rest was, so it was like this

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.140
and then all American here.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:43.020
And when we got there, we landed,

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:44.300
the guns were already there.

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.060
So you ripped out the unit before you.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.380
So those guys were just leaving

01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.260
and we were just replacing them.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:51.580
So we knew the guns, they were Canadian guns.

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:54.140
We understood how to run those, that was fine.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:59.700
When we got there though, we had come in on Chinook

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.660
and Chinooks are super loud.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:03.100
And they're like, we're hearing protection.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:07.180
They don't, do not, no, this is not reality.

01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:08.460
This is why I'm partially deaf.

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.060
Now this is not reality.

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.140
Sorry to take a tangent,

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.620
but do you usually wear ear protection

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.460
in any aspects of warfare of this whole process?

01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:21.140
You wear comms, like you have a comm on like in a radio

01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:23.020
if you're outside the wire.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:25.220
So comms, is that like a Bluetooth headset?

01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.020
Yes, it's a Bluetooth headset.

01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:27.860
Okay. No.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.380
Like from Nike or like-

01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:30.540
I was gonna say Adidas.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:31.380
Okay.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:33.580
Maybe Apple was involved at some point.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:34.420
I don't know.

01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.900
This equipment looked like it was from World War II.

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:39.900
So it's comms, but is that having ear protection?

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:40.740
No.

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.900
And I didn't wear them.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.540
That's just what some people wore.

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.820
People, when you were as low as me,

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.860
like we weren't privy to conversate.

01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:48.860
We were just told what to do and you do it.

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.020
So when you're doing like on the OP tower,

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.180
you have a radio you pick up and you call in

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.300
and then you put the radio down.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.180
But for ear, a hearing protection, I mean,

01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:57.260
I would put in earplugs,

01:28:57.260 --> 01:29:00.020
but those things are so violently loud

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:02.660
that earplugs, they don't do it justice.

01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:04.660
I feel like when you go shooting,

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:09.060
there's certain kinds of earplugs that you,

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:10.420
it blocks out the gun,

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:13.220
like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns

01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.980
and you can still hear other types of stuff.

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:18.380
So the ones they issued us were these big things

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.940
that had like a head piece like here,

01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.780
but you have to wear your helmet when you're firing.

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.620
Right.

01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.700
So you can't have both on.

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.340
Okay, so how much are you aware

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.060
of the logistics of the whole thing?

01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.780
That's always fascinating with warfare.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:33.620
Like in terms of setting up,

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:36.180
you mentioned gravel and the fobs,

01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:37.660
like setting all those bases up.

01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:39.660
Were you seeing any of this?

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:42.060
Or again, it's a 19 year old kind of just.

01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:43.460
Well, it's not that I was oblivious.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.980
That's the one thing I would say I wasn't.

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:46.940
I'm very aware of my surroundings.

01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:48.700
That's something that's always been taught to me

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:50.020
from a very early age

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:52.020
because I travel a lot with my dad in the truck.

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.140
And so my dad would be like,

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.340
you're gonna go into that bathroom

01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.740
and I'm gonna watch you come out

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:57.220
and you're gonna watch everyone around you

01:29:57.220 --> 01:29:58.820
because people get kidnapped.

01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:00.460
Like this is just the reality.

01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:03.060
I was always very paranoid.

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.940
So you're paying attention to surroundings.

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.740
But the mob was already built up when we got there.

01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.940
Okay, this is already like well established bases already.

01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:12.780
Like there's.

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:13.940
Established enough.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:14.860
All right.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:20.300
And that is one of the first times you've heard actual fire.

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.580
Yeah, that was like the.

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.660
I mean, I'd heard it when we shoot

01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:26.020
and when we zero in weapons and we do all that stuff.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.780
But I had never heard it like that before.

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:31.900
And then you would see the guys,

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.620
the Americans would roll out every day

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:34.940
and go on patrol and come back,

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:35.940
roll up, come back, come back.

01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.380
And so you would see them,

01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:39.660
you would hear them, they would tell the stories,

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:40.980
those types of things.

01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:43.820
But I never experienced it because we never,

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:45.580
we never got attacked.

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:46.860
Like our base never got hit.

01:30:46.860 --> 01:30:48.620
We were really lucky that way.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.340
There were other ones around us that were getting hit,

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.580
but we weren't getting hit.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:54.700
Like we were very fortunate.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.300
At least we didn't get hit when I was there.

01:30:56.300 --> 01:31:00.460
I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.540
There was an attempt at some point in the past,

01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:04.980
but I wasn't privy to that.

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.220
But we were in the OP towers,

01:31:06.220 --> 01:31:07.980
so we had to do our own security.

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:10.340
But because we were such a small subset of Canadians

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.620
and we always had to have people running the guns

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.660
and ready to run the guns at all times,

01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:16.460
we only had to man one tower.

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:19.220
So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.780
in the tower, depending on whatever,

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.140
but you would do it every day.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:25.940
So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:26.900
at that opportunity.

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:28.700
Otherwise it was just like your walls.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.660
What did it look like?

01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:33.700
Is it beautiful, just the full landscape or is it?

01:31:33.700 --> 01:31:37.140
Where I was, there was mountains in the distance.

01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:39.420
It was just very sandy, very flat.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.900
And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.

01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:43.700
It wasn't a lot to look at.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:45.220
There was a long road that you knew

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:47.100
that got hit all the time.

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:48.540
There wasn't a lot to look at.

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:54.460
Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.980
over the decades.

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.100
It really is.

01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:01.380
And the fact that the populace, the civilians,

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.980
are almost completely clueless to the full history of things

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:07.740
in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.860
Yeah, well, if you look at the location of it, right,

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:12.820
on a map, it makes more sense.

01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.300
You can wrap your brain around it.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:17.340
But I met plenty of people who had never even seen

01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:19.060
a picture of themselves when I was in that country.

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:21.340
So I mean, how much more are they gonna understand

01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:23.660
if they don't know what even exists outside?

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:29.420
You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl

01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:32.140
and showing it to her, an Afghani girl.

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.460
Yeah.

01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:35.860
We were, I was with the British at that time

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:36.980
and we were on that operation

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.260
that gets highlighted quite a bit.

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:42.660
And we had stopped and the ICOM radios were pinging

01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:47.500
and ICOM radios are a radio that we have an interpreter on

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.300
that the Taliban, basically we can hear what they're saying.

01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:53.500
It's their comms, it's us tapped in.

01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.100
When it's really clear, they're close.

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:59.580
When it's scatty and they're far enough away,

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.460
normally, you know, they're not planning an attack,

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:04.020
although you never know, really.

01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:07.460
And we were going door to door,

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:09.060
kind of like what they're doing now.

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.860
And we were pulling people out of their houses

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:13.020
and we knew there were, there was people in there

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.700
that were active Taliban and we knew the ICOMs were pinging.

01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:18.180
When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:20.220
and locked them inside the house.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:23.220
Because often nowadays, women, the women,

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:25.500
they would hide things on them that they shouldn't have

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.500
because no one would be ever there to search them

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:30.260
because there isn't a lot of women on the front lines.

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:32.100
But I got borrowed to go specifically

01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:33.460
search women and children.

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.780
So they had me and one of the little girls kind of snuck out

01:33:37.820 --> 01:33:40.940
and was kind of sitting near me and I was eating something

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:43.220
and I had like these little candies,

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.620
they're called little sweeties.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.540
The British have them in the ration packs, I don't know.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:47.780
They're good though.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:50.820
And she saw me eating them and so I gave them to her.

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:52.260
And then her brother came over and slapped her

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.860
upside the head and took them from her.

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.700
So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head

01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.060
and just pointed my gun at her while she ate them all.

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:01.140
Because I was like, no, like you can have these.

01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.660
I'm gonna stand here and make sure you do.

01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.820
And I remember asking, can I take a picture with her?

01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:07.860
I asked the turp, can you ask her,

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.420
can I take a picture with her?

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.220
And she was very confused.

01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:13.980
And when you look at the photo, you see her face,

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.140
she's very stunned, very stunned.

01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:18.700
And it wasn't my camera, it was my officer's camera.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:22.260
It was a hot pink like fluorescent pink camera.

01:34:22.260 --> 01:34:25.140
So I pulled this like huge pink thing and I'm like,

01:34:25.140 --> 01:34:26.420
let's take a picture.

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.620
And so she stood there and took a picture,

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.220
but then she grabbed the camera

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:32.060
because I flipped it and showed it to her.

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:36.060
And her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.700
And they're like, oh, that's gone forever.

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:40.020
Like that's, it's over for you.

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:42.860
And then she came out and she kind of snuck out

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:43.900
and I went in and grabbed it

01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.740
and the mom lifted up her burka

01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.500
and was showing me that she like shaped her legs

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:50.260
to be more Western.

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:53.180
And I was just, at that moment,

01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:59.580
I don't know that I could have realized

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.500
how much that moment affected me,

01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:05.580
how much that moment would affect me later on in my life.

01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:09.020
Until it's been later on in my life.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:13.340
Yeah, there's little like glimmers like that

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:16.780
in parts of the world that are basically,

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.620
you're taking away everything from the populace,

01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.620
like freedoms and so on.

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.940
And when they, when you see that glimmer of humanity,

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.340
like, yeah, shave legs or like using technology

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:33.660
for the first time, it's magic or like food

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.700
and being presented with certain kinds of foods

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:37.180
that you've never tried.

01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:42.180
I mean, you wanna see true like joy of discovery

01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:46.020
is you bring basically the American supermarket,

01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:48.980
anything from it to most parts of the world.

01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:52.140
And they, I just, I mean, I remember even,

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:56.340
I mean, we weren't like in poverty in Russia, just poor,

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.460
but just the supermarket was full of joy.

01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:00.500
I thought I could just die happy

01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:02.900
in an American supermarket when I first saw it.

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.300
And how old were you when you came here?

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:05.500
13.

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.460
Did you speak English?

01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:11.940
Yeah, not well, I thought, I never was good at languages.

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.100
So I, it was very much like,

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.220
why would I need to learn another language?

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.060
Oh, okay.

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:21.900
It was that attitude is very like, doesn't, I don't know.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:26.380
Well, no, I think culturally in, not in America,

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.540
but everywhere else in the world,

01:36:28.540 --> 01:36:30.980
it's constantly kind of seen,

01:36:30.980 --> 01:36:33.660
it's a good thing to do to learn all the languages.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:34.500
Right.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.940
Because it's like, that's the language of the world.

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:37.780
Right.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:39.980
And I just thought like,

01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.020
I don't need English to discover the beauty of the world.

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.140
Like what, it doesn't, like, I enjoy life.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:46.340
I enjoy soccer.

01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.540
I enjoy, I don't remember what else I enjoyed in life,

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.180
but math, like, why do I need English for this?

01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.500
So that kind of attitude got me a lot of trouble

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.820
when I came here because I couldn't.

01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.260
You were reluctant?

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.300
Yeah, but also just couldn't speak well.

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:03.820
And when you move 13 years old, it's middle school.

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.820
You get made fun of a lot.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:08.020
You get bullied and all those kinds of things,

01:37:08.020 --> 01:37:10.260
which in retrospect is a very positive thing

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.380
because it makes you harder.

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.700
I thought being Russian would be like hard enough.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.660
No, well, me, everyone is different.

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.780
I mean, the part of the Russian thing is,

01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.460
it's kind of, you know, I'm joking because if you know me,

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.780
I admire being hard.

01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:31.260
I admire fighting and these kinds of things, right?

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:33.340
These, what would you call them?

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.820
Struggle in all of its forms.

01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:36.980
Martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:40.300
But I'm ultimately, like, I'm so much about love.

01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:42.140
Like, I'm clearly sensitive to the world

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:46.700
in some weird genetic way that it was important for me

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:50.900
to harden up when I came here and I was in love with people

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.260
and it's like, and everybody's being mean to me.

01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:55.620
And it's like, what, that, it's like,

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:59.620
it's a little like slap, like, oh, okay.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:02.980
Like, it's not, like, life is not often fair.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.060
And then that's when, for me personally,

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.020
everybody has different journeys of hardship

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:09.540
that are much, much more difficult.

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.340
Like, your story is much more difficult.

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.060
Is, you know, I started to read a lot.

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:17.380
It's like something happens, some kind of challenge

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.740
where you start to think about the world,

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:21.020
start to think about yourself.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:25.180
That can ultimately create really interesting minds.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:28.260
It can break some people, it can create interesting minds

01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:29.100
and it's ultimately your choice.

01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:29.940
But those people are weak

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:31.580
and then they just need to be weeded out.

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:33.820
I talked about this, you know, the strong will survive,

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:34.860
the weak will die off.

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:38.660
Yeah, now you're talking Russian to me.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:39.900
I'm not speaking Russian.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:43.740
I'm just giving solid life advice.

01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:45.740
Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.

01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:48.860
Yeah, that's your inner David Goggins

01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:49.980
coming out real quick here.

01:38:49.980 --> 01:38:51.820
Okay, the fob.

01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.100
Yeah, and then I was just explaining to you

01:38:54.100 --> 01:38:57.580
that the way it is run, you're gonna love this.

01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:00.740
When we walked up to those tents for the first time,

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.340
the people that were there before us left us a noose.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.940
I have a photo of it.

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.020
Like is that?

01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:09.300
Like hanging from the tent.

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:11.740
Like at the front of the tent, like welcome.

01:39:11.740 --> 01:39:15.100
So you were also mentioning like the dark humor of it.

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:17.580
Is it basically a funny joke?

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.540
Correct, yeah, it was funny at first.

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:20.740
It's pretty funny.

01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.580
It was funny during the time.

01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:26.700
Now when I look back at it, I was like, come on.

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:29.860
I was, I mean, I get it because they had already been there

01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:33.020
so afterwards I can see how it's funny.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.980
Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community,

01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:40.180
now I'm like, oh, I don't post that photo.

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.020
Really?

01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:43.700
So doesn't that dark humor still somehow help

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.380
even when you're considering suicide?

01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.220
Doesn't it?

01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:47.060
Some of it somehow.

01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:48.180
It makes it copable.

01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.340
Somehow, yeah.

01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:51.220
It's like you're not hiding it.

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:55.020
It's like humor is one of the ways to reveal

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:59.900
the reality of abuse, of suffering.

01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.420
If you look at, there's this photo that generates around,

01:40:02.420 --> 01:40:05.740
right around suicide prevention month, which is September.

01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.100
And it's always like a photo of like Robin Williams

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:10.940
and Bourdain and all of these other individuals

01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.660
who were comedians who all took their lives

01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.380
and they're all smiling.

01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:18.900
And they're like, this is the face of depression.

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.620
There's a way our brains work where humor

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.060
is a necessary part of survival,

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:28.060
whether it's used for joyous things

01:40:28.060 --> 01:40:31.700
or it's used for ways to cope through life.

01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.700
For me in the military, humor was one of the things

01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:35.140
that helped get me through.

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:38.940
And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor,

01:40:41.300 --> 01:40:44.100
humor makes some of the horrific things I say

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.460
not seem so horrific.

01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:50.700
And people can digest it rather than being like,

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:52.940
you need to be locked up somewhere.

01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.940
Yeah, that's why, I mean, one of the aspects

01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:58.940
of Russian humor, there's a darkness to it

01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:03.940
because through it reverberates all the millions

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.860
of people who died and it seems like the only way

01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:10.420
to make sense of it is to joke about it.

01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:11.460
I still love it.

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.500
Because if you don't, it'll break you.

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:14.340
Something like that.

01:41:14.340 --> 01:41:18.340
Or also, humor just seems to be the highest form

01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:22.020
of us humans and the human experience.

01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:26.300
It just seems, it seems to somehow accumulate

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.820
the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness of it,

01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:31.980
because ultimately all of the suffering,

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.260
it's all just apes fighting for power and love

01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:39.900
and somehow torturing each other in the process.

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:42.580
Hello, podcast listener, Lex here.

01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:44.980
Click into mission to say that some of the names

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.340
in the following story have been silenced out

01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:49.860
to protect their privacy.

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.860
The story of and witnessing, I think your first,

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.460
somebody you met, somebody you saw,

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:04.460
somebody you began to be close with,

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:09.460
his life, him dying, can you tell the story?

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:14.620
Sure, that's no problem.

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.980
I will tell you that I have, I'm gonna leave

01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:18.340
some of the names out of the people

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:23.340
because they have reached out and asked that I do such.

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:26.380
I've also been informed of other things I forgot

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:28.260
that happened during the thing

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.100
that were way worse than I thought.

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.860
So I'll try to add those in

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.180
because that's new information to me

01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:35.300
because my brain has blocked it out,

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:37.740
but I've been told, which is good

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.660
because it's better detail.

01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:42.460
So we were doing a movement that morning

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:46.220
and we were going from compound to compound

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.780
I was never told what we were doing.

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.220
I knew what my job was.

01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:53.500
I didn't know the operational overview.

01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:56.900
I didn't know who we were looking for.

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:58.020
I wasn't there for that.

01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.020
My job was specifically to look after the women and children

01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.740
and to provide support if need be.

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.980
And when you have certain people,

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:11.300
so IE the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog,

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.460
and then you have the medics

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:14.900
and then you have like a female searcher,

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:17.620
there's only one of those in each unit

01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.060
or if there's even one in each unit,

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:22.300
I got passed between units

01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:25.740
so that they could have access to me for both.

01:43:25.740 --> 01:43:28.300
And we were kind of sitting

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.380
and we were waiting for the all clear to move.

01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:34.620
And at that time, the compound wall

01:43:34.620 --> 01:43:37.780
that I was leaning up against, I had my back up against,

01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:42.260
I wasn't facing the direction where I actually blew up.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:44.180
I had my back to it

01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:46.860
and I had happened to turn and look to the left.

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.900
And on the right-hand side,

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.740
across the road of where we were leaned up against

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:54.340
was another compound two stories high,

01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.300
people inside, a sniper on the roof and a spotter.

01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.620
There was a handful of us on this wall

01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.900
and in front of me, there was a road.

01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:09.500
The road went straight.

01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:10.340
That compound's here.

01:44:10.340 --> 01:44:11.780
There's another road here

01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:13.220
on the right-hand side in front of it.

01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:15.340
And then this road went along here

01:44:15.340 --> 01:44:17.500
and this was a wide open space.

01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.140
Just a huge, we hate those.

01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.660
You hate those because it's too much space.

01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:24.580
It's too easy.

01:44:24.580 --> 01:44:26.420
It's like fish in a barrel.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:28.260
You don't wanna be in that field.

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.900
Cause there's too much line of sight.

01:44:31.900 --> 01:44:36.020
Line of sight, could be IEDs, it could be anything.

01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:41.020
And so when I was leaning up against the wall,

01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:47.700
we'd send a couple of people ahead to go and clear the road

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:49.020
so that we could all go along it

01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.380
and then clear the gray pup off to the left-hand side.

01:44:52.380 --> 01:44:55.780
We were doing that because they use those locations

01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:58.940
to put IEDs so that when you're going to search it,

01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:01.060
it's just, it's a better chance

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:02.740
of you blowing into a million pieces,

01:45:02.740 --> 01:45:04.500
essentially why they love that.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.260
Put bombs in small places, send people into small places,

01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:10.460
small places go boom, they paint the walls.

01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:13.380
So we were just kind of sitting and waiting.

01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:16.260
And then I turned, happened to turn

01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:17.300
and I was looking in that direction

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:19.180
and I heard the ground shake

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:22.380
before I even realized what I was seeing with my own eyes.

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:27.380
The ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body.

01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:32.580
I think it was the torso just kind of fly through the air

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.020
and land into the field.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:38.140
And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.

01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:41.460
It was like the, they were sitting and watching and waiting

01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.300
and they do that.

01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:44.060
And I say they, I mean the Taliban, they do that.

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.100
They love that because then they can record it

01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:48.820
for propaganda and they can use it against us.

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:52.540
And they just love being able to take our people out.

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.940
And we had the interpreter sitting beside me

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:56.660
and he had the ICOM radio on.

01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:58.340
And as soon as the blast went off,

01:45:58.340 --> 01:46:03.340
I heard just the scream of like, I just, I heard it.

01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:06.220
And I knew what that meant, but I couldn't,

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:09.580
I didn't understand what was about to happen.

01:46:10.860 --> 01:46:14.700
I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my brain

01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.020
around what was about to happen

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:18.820
because I had never been outside the wire.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:21.340
And people are like, people say to me now,

01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:24.540
they're like, no, no, there's no way that shit's true.

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:25.940
There's no way that she was involved in that

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.340
and then, then that and then in that and then in that.

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:30.260
Well, let me explain.

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:35.260
I was one person, I was being passed around to units.

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:42.060
I was with a ton of different people, I had no comms

01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:45.660
and I was just being passed around to units.

01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:49.980
I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.

01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.100
And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet.

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.740
It felt like, and then I found out later,

01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:02.180
it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.

01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.620
So that made me feel better.

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:04.900
Cause then I was like, well,

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.180
I have a lot of survivor's guilt.

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.380
That's like a thing that's still stuck with me.

01:47:08.380 --> 01:47:11.380
I've worked through a lot of shit, but survivor's guilt.

01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:12.820
That's a big one for me.

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:14.660
Certain food is a big one for me.

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:16.940
Certain food.

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:19.660
Yeah, skin on food.

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:23.300
So like chicken with skin on it.

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:26.900
Oh, just because of the biology of death?

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:27.740
Just what?

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.180
Well, when you hold people's bodies

01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:31.380
in your hands with no gloves on,

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.460
you know what that feels like.

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:36.980
When you touch raw meat again, it's the same thing.

01:47:36.980 --> 01:47:38.060
That's what that feels like

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:40.420
when it's a dying or dead body.

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.460
Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces.

01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:43.900
So I just had pieces of him.

01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:46.820
So there was no,

01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:52.460
there was no differentiator of like,

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:55.220
this was his thigh, or this was his torso,

01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:58.420
or there was like, there was none of that.

01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:00.660
There was only one instance with the boot, but,

01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:07.460
at that point, we had been in some firefights

01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:08.980
and we had been taking some rounds,

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:11.980
but it was more like take around,

01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:15.780
you know, get hit and then we duck into a compound

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.260
and we would set up and then we'd be firing.

01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:20.580
I wasn't really involved in a lot of the firefights

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.420
until after this.

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.900
After that, the rest of the week, I was like,

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:25.740
I was angry and I wanted them all to go

01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.300
and I wanted to be in every position

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:28.500
to take them out myself.

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:30.580
So I put myself in every position.

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:31.980
So I made sure I was on the roof.

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:33.020
I made sure I was there.

01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:35.100
I made sure, hey, you need something, I'll fucking run it.

01:48:35.100 --> 01:48:36.260
I don't care if I die anymore,

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:39.420
because as soon as that happened, my light switch went off.

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:40.780
It didn't matter anymore to me.

01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:42.580
Can you go through what happened?

01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:47.180
So far, you were hearing these screams.

01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:51.820
Yeah, so the IED went off and what had happened was

01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:54.380
they put an IED inside of a grape hut

01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:58.180
and the grape hut has rectangular holes in the wall

01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:01.900
and there's just like one door and it's this tall mud hut

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:03.820
with just all these like holes in it.

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.660
And they had put an IED underneath a pile of sticks

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:12.180
and had a metal detector, the Brits carry them.

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.780
I've never seen, I think other countries have them,

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:15.660
but I've only ever seen them use it.

01:49:15.660 --> 01:49:19.100
And that's how we were kind of detecting if there was an IED,

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:21.260
we must have hit it, the sticks or something

01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:22.580
and it set it off.

01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:24.500
And it just, it was over.

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:25.660
There's no way he felt anything.

01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:27.700
And then there was another guy at the door,

01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:30.820
bent down on one knee and he was facing

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:35.780
and kind of watching for and then it blasted him on this side.

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.420
And so it took him out and pulled his kid off,

01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:38.740
pulled his helmet off, pulled everything off,

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:41.460
fucked him all up, big time.

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.380
This is one IED.

01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:46.900
Yeah, but it was in a contained area

01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:50.100
and he was in the doorway, up and out.

01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:54.300
Can you explain what an IED is and how does it work?

01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.620
I can do my best.

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.340
They're improvised explosive devices.

01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:59.460
They can be used pretty much out of anything

01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:00.620
to make anything.

01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:04.260
So garbage, when we got to Afghanistan,

01:50:04.260 --> 01:50:05.660
they did the IED meeting with us.

01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:07.300
They're like, these are what we're finding.

01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:09.300
They would show us diffused IEDs.

01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.900
So they would see those big blue drums

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:14.180
filled with gasoline buried in the ground.

01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:15.500
You would see a wire.

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:16.980
It would go to a pressure plate.

01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:19.020
You hit the pressure plate that would hit that

01:50:19.020 --> 01:50:20.580
and it would go.

01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:22.340
You would see IEDs.

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.580
Some of them were ridiculous.

01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:26.700
The engineering that went into some of these

01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:29.660
was hilarious because they were thinking.

01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:31.860
They were thinking to use everything they could.

01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.660
There was a cigarette pack they had used.

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:37.100
They lined the inside with tin foil.

01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:38.780
Then when you stepped on the tin foil,

01:50:38.780 --> 01:50:40.340
it had a piece of wire and it was enough of a spark

01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.780
to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown out

01:50:42.780 --> 01:50:43.700
that were all dead.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:45.020
When you fuse them all together,

01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:47.180
there was enough juice to make it go.

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:49.660
Then they would attach that to like phosphorus

01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:51.980
or gasoline or whatever they could

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:53.940
that would make a big boom.

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:56.380
They would use, yeah,

01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:57.820
that's why you never kick garbage on the ground.

01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.900
You'll never see me kick something on the ground.

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.940
You'll see me walk around it always.

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:04.420
If I ever see a pile of rocks or something

01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:05.620
that looks like it shouldn't be there,

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:06.980
I won't walk near it.

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:10.180
Even now, because they used that pile of rocks

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:12.060
to remind people there's something there.

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:12.980
We don't know what that means,

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:14.620
but we know that something's there.

01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.820
And very often they would use anything,

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.860
garbage, wires.

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:22.300
We had to burn everything for a reason.

01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:29.060
It's so terrifying for the source of death

01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:33.020
to be like little parts of the environment

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.420
and then people that don't look,

01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.860
they're not dressed as soldiers.

01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:41.660
It's like civilians and like regular,

01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:45.540
because then when you have to come back or even there,

01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.500
you're just surrounded by danger

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.420
and then you distrust everything essentially.

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:51.260
That's the problem.

01:51:51.260 --> 01:51:53.940
And that's why you have such PTSD issues

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:55.660
with the soldiers we have now.

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.700
Because you're in the environment

01:51:57.700 --> 01:52:00.260
in which it's very similar.

01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:03.740
So there's this one IED.

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:07.060
So this one IED, I still don't know what it was.

01:52:07.060 --> 01:52:09.980
Went off, body flew.

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:13.380
The guy at the door, he kicked out.

01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:15.860
He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.

01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.220
At that point, the radio started going crazy.

01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:24.700
Like I could hear the guys yelling and screaming,

01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:25.540
trying to figure it out.

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.380
And then you could hear the numbers being called.

01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.700
KIA, number, number, number, number.

01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:31.260
I don't know anybody's service number.

01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:33.580
I don't know what's going on.

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:36.860
Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down.

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:39.540
And like live fire starts happening.

01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:43.140
And I'm like, holy fuck, things are popping off.

01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:45.500
And I remember just looking at KIA

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.260
and being like, we need to go, we need to go now.

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:51.460
And I just got this like, I was like, we're going.

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.700
And they're like, hold on, Burns.

01:52:52.700 --> 01:52:54.460
And I'm like, we're fucking going.

01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:56.700
Like I wasn't dealing with it well.

01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:59.100
And they're like, all right, all right, go, go, go, go, go.

01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:04.660
And we, you know, I helped out with that to other individual,

01:53:05.900 --> 01:53:10.140
kind of held him down, started doing medic work on him.

01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:13.300
And he just kept saying, where's, where's, where's.

01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:14.460
He was in such a state of shock.

01:53:14.460 --> 01:53:16.900
I've never seen somebody's eyeballs so big in my life.

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.340
She's like, where's, where's, where's.

01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.300
We go, hi, he's good buddy, he's good, he's good.

01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.660
Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though,

01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.220
because these guys were just, oh.

01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:29.020
And when they talk fast, it's even worse.

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:32.580
And then, so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch

01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.060
along the side of the road,

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:36.100
because the road hadn't been cleared.

01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:40.220
And we're running through these tall,

01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:42.980
they look like cannabis plants, but they're not.

01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:45.580
But it just, it's just very thick bush.

01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:48.180
And I felt like I was running in slow motion.

01:53:48.180 --> 01:53:49.860
So if you picture one of your video games,

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.660
where like the tunnel vision and then you're just,

01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:54.980
you can hear your breathing is like that.

01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:57.060
And you're running and you can't move fast enough.

01:53:57.100 --> 01:54:02.100
And then you're just trying to get there and we hit the road

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.300
and the rounds are coming down and mortars are coming down

01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:06.700
and they're like, okay, on three run.

01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:09.620
So we run on three and we run into the compound.

01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.580
I mean, into the great putt.

01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:13.500
And I remember looking around

01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.820
and very seriously going, where is he?

01:54:17.260 --> 01:54:18.980
Just genuinely asking.

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:19.820
I think it was,

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.580
been messaging me and he's been incredible.

01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:26.900
He's one of the best soldiers I've ever served with.

01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.700
He was a higher up.

01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.540
So he was running part of this.

01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:32.140
He's messaged me and he was giving me some information.

01:54:32.140 --> 01:54:35.180
And he's like, I was in there with you.

01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.460
And he goes, I remember, cause you handed me the boot.

01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:40.300
And cause I walked over and I, all the rounds were like,

01:54:40.300 --> 01:54:42.500
we were being shot at, mortars were coming down,

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.580
but it was this slow motion.

01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:48.140
And I remember walking over to the hole in the ground

01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:51.660
and seeing his boot in the ground.

01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:55.220
But it was, his leg was still hanging,

01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:58.020
like just below his knee was still in it.

01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:00.100
But the boot was perfectly laced up.

01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:01.460
Like the boot was fine.

01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:06.940
And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:08.980
and I was like, we could reuse the boot.

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:15.740
No, that wasn't even, what is that?

01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:20.300
Was that, was that actually an intelligent attempt

01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:26.260
at humor or was it some kind of deeply lost?

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.700
Like you were completely just lost.

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:28.860
I think my brain broke.

01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:32.940
I think that's the moment I call my life switch went off.

01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:37.420
Did you understand that he was dead at that point?

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:40.860
Like intellectually, you were just, it just broke.

01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:48.380
No emotion, like it just broke.

01:55:48.380 --> 01:55:49.500
It just shattered.

01:55:51.300 --> 01:55:53.820
It shattered.

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.740
I felt it happen, felt.

01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:03.820
I didn't feel, I didn't feel anything.

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:08.340
It just broke.

01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:13.420
And at that moment, because later there's some anger almost

01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.660
at that moment, none of that.

01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:17.220
I couldn't comprehend what happened.

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.060
I knew he wasn't there anymore

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:22.460
because they looked at me and said, what's here is here.

01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:25.300
Start grabbing pieces we need to fucking move.

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:30.860
And so I handed the boot over, they took it.

01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:33.900
And then I started just grabbing anything out of the walls

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:37.140
because those little rectangles had flesh hanging from it.

01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:40.900
And I didn't have my gloves on

01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:42.420
because I only used them to search.

01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:43.460
And-

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.180
So you want to bring-

01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:46.020
Everything-

01:56:46.020 --> 01:56:46.860
Bring back.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.620
You don't want to leave.

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:51.500
This is what, even if they're dead, do you want to save,

01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:55.220
save those you served with?

01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:57.180
Yeah, because they deserve that.

01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:58.820
They don't deserve to have a piece of them drugged

01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:00.340
behind a truck for propaganda.

01:57:00.340 --> 01:57:02.140
It's not, it's not fair.

01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:04.940
What did the others, I mean, was there just a focus

01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:07.220
on mission or was there a panic?

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:08.900
No panic with these guys.

01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.540
These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers

01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:12.500
I've ever seen in my life.

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:16.420
They, we started grabbing and remind me, he said, you know,

01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:20.100
you, that's not, he goes, when people say

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:20.940
that's the worst part of your day,

01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:21.940
that wasn't even the worst part of your day.

01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:24.580
Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?

01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.540
No.

01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.620
No, I do though.

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:36.260
Thank you for that.

01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:39.020
So there's parts you don't even, they're just not-

01:57:39.020 --> 01:57:40.020
They don't register.

01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:44.140
Because I had some people contact me and be like,

01:57:44.140 --> 01:57:45.660
you didn't tell it, right?

01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:49.020
And war is subjective and war is from your perspective

01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:51.860
and war is messy and horrific.

01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:56.860
And war is graphic and violence and painful.

01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.020
Your brain remembers what it wants to remember

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:06.820
and your brain allows you to remember

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.340
what it allows you to remember.

01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:10.900
And there's reasons that you don't remember everything.

01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:16.340
And so we were getting, we were really getting hit.

01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:19.820
We were getting, it was bad.

01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:21.460
And some of the guys, machine gunners had come up

01:58:21.460 --> 01:58:23.220
to do cover fire.

01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:27.860
And I know we were calling in for air support

01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:31.820
to come pick up the guys because they had to go.

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.820
And we just collected everything we could,

01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.780
but I did remember screaming, like,

01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:40.100
we didn't get them all, we didn't get them all.

01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:40.940
There's no way we got them all.

01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:42.500
We did not fucking get them all.

01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:43.940
And I remember one of the guys looking at me

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:44.900
being like, we got them, we got them.

01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.980
I'm like, we didn't fucking get them.

01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:46.820
We didn't get them.

01:58:46.820 --> 01:58:47.660
They're like, no, we got them.

01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:50.420
And I couldn't say it enough.

01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:54.220
And so I grabbed as much as I could.

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:59.020
I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap

01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:03.380
and I had his helmet and someone else's helmet in my arm.

01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:07.740
And then I had my weapon in front of me

01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:09.860
and I was carrying it.

01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:13.620
And then we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.

01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:16.500
Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.500
And there was a couple of guys in front of us

01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:19.780
and there were a couple behind me

01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:22.020
and I was kind of in the middle.

01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.540
And we said, okay, we're just gonna have to run.

01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:25.540
We're gonna have to fucking run the road.

01:59:25.540 --> 01:59:26.380
We're gonna just have to run it.

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.220
We're just gonna chance it.

01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:30.180
So we ran it and that was the closest.

01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:31.980
Well, that was, I guess, not the closest,

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:33.340
but it felt like it was the closest.

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:37.660
I could hear the whiz of the rounds going by me.

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:40.860
It's a weird noise when they're coming at you

01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:42.460
than when they're leaving you.

01:59:43.460 --> 01:59:47.700
And so that slowed everything down for me.

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.940
And then one of the guys accidentally

01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:50.660
dropped the edge of the stretcher

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.820
and everything fell off into the ditch.

01:59:52.820 --> 01:59:56.140
And then we had to go back down and get it back up.

01:59:56.140 --> 01:59:57.860
And so we kept running.

01:59:57.860 --> 01:59:59.980
And we finally got back into the compound

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:02.700
that that sniper was sitting off on the right-hand side

02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:04.060
and we got all in there.

02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:09.020
And I know the, I think said there was two flights.

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:10.060
I only thought there was one,

02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:12.500
but apparently there was two flights.

02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:15.180
So went on one, his body went on one.

02:00:15.180 --> 02:00:17.740
And then I think he said went on the other.

02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:21.340
And then they took off.

02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:24.420
And then when they leave though, they rain hell down

02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:25.980
on anything they can see on the ground.

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:28.300
And that is a beautiful sight

02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.780
because they had mortar rounds coming down

02:00:29.780 --> 02:00:32.860
and it just, it was getting really, really bad.

02:00:32.940 --> 02:00:35.740
And then as soon as the Blackhawks took off,

02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:39.700
all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet.

02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:43.300
Like deafening quiet.

02:00:44.540 --> 02:00:46.380
And we were sitting inside the compound

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:49.180
and I, one of the medics looked at me and you could see,

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:51.820
and I still do it now and I'm working on not doing it,

02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.660
but I do it when I get really overwhelmed.

02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.740
Because I didn't have any gloves on,

02:00:56.740 --> 02:01:00.700
I had blood all over my hands and just like body and stuff.

02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:03.020
So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.180
and I started rubbing.

02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:08.860
And so I rub, I do this when I'm stressed, I'll rub my hands.

02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:15.580
And I still can't, I still can't do,

02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.820
I still can't eat food with skin on it.

02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:20.340
And I can't like, like salmon and stuff.

02:01:20.340 --> 02:01:22.700
Like I can't, anything with skin, I can't touch it.

02:01:22.700 --> 02:01:24.420
And like, if I'm making meat at home,

02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:26.220
like for my husband and my son,

02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:28.460
like I have like meat gloves

02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:29.780
and then I have like a fork and a knife.

02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.860
And I'm like cutting it, like I never touch it.

02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:34.620
I can't touch it.

02:01:34.620 --> 02:01:39.620
So there's something almost like the texture of the biology

02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:45.140
of a human flesh that just, that's at the level of,

02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.660
that's the level of your trauma.

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:51.340
Yeah, and it's been, I mean, it's 2021, this was in 2009.

02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:52.940
And I've worked on this, like, and I mean,

02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:56.980
I've been in like treatment religiously

02:01:56.980 --> 02:02:00.300
just to be able to keep me alive for this decade.

02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:02.540
And so it's not like, it's like, oh, I've never,

02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:03.980
you never even tried to get better.

02:02:03.980 --> 02:02:06.500
It's like, I never used to leave my house.

02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:07.980
I used to call people that look like that

02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.340
horrific names in public.

02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:13.700
I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.

02:02:13.700 --> 02:02:16.300
I'm a fairly happy individual now.

02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:21.300
What about, you're talking about sort of skin and parts

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:26.900
and, but there's also just the fact that we're mortal

02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.740
and there's somebody close to you who dies.

02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:34.460
So you watch walk up and then never come back out again?

02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:38.740
Yeah, it's like, you're facing mortality in a very real way.

02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:43.340
And in a way that's not the same as somebody dying

02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:47.020
from cancer in a hospital, although it has echoes of that

02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:48.660
because that's also absurd.

02:02:48.660 --> 02:02:52.380
And like, it doesn't feel like there's justice to it

02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:54.900
in any kind of way, but it's so sudden.

02:02:55.740 --> 02:03:00.740
Like, have you been able to make sense of that,

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.020
of your feelings about it?

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:04.780
Like, how do you feel about it?

02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:08.780
Or is everything just shrouded in this like trauma

02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:14.700
that you're not able to just feel for the loss

02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:17.500
of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?

02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:24.740
I think I had, when he, when I realized he wasn't there,

02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:30.260
when I realized that he, that was the,

02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:32.060
that was what was left of him.

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:34.540
I found out afterwards there was other parts

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:37.780
that were outside and went back.

02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:41.060
I think he said, went back and they got,

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:43.060
they ended up getting the rest of him.

02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:44.500
So that made me happy

02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:46.500
because I just found this out this week.

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:49.180
So.

02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:52.780
That means, so that means you have a feeling like,

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:55.740
you still feel like parts of him were left behind.

02:03:55.740 --> 02:03:56.580
Yeah.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:02.300
On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind,

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:07.300
literally I lost my mind and I was screaming

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:10.300
that he wasn't all in there.

02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:13.300
I'm happy now knowing that he was,

02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:15.300
but I held onto that for 10 years.

02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:21.620
Yeah, this, yeah, the sandbags, like it's,

02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:27.940
the bulk of the weight is not from human flesh.

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.500
Yeah.

02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.780
He was a young kid too.

02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:35.340
It was, I think it was his first deployment as well.

02:04:35.340 --> 02:04:40.340
Like he was, he was a young kid and he was just,

02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:44.060
just going to clear the road for the rest of us, right?

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.460
Like not, like, you know you're in war

02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:48.460
and you know that you're outside the wire

02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:50.460
and you know things could happen.

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:55.020
You understand that to the extent you can understand that.

02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:59.380
When it's happening, it's something very different.

02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:01.620
Also, maybe you can correct me,

02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.620
but there's something much more like brutal about an IED.

02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:08.140
It's ferocious.

02:05:08.140 --> 02:05:10.020
Versus like a bullet.

02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:12.620
Cause a bullet you still,

02:05:13.700 --> 02:05:16.700
watching somebody close to you die from a bullet,

02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.860
you still get the basic humanity.

02:05:20.860 --> 02:05:23.780
Like, so IED basically converted a human being

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:27.020
into sort of parts by biological parts.

02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:27.980
A cheese core.

02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:29.020
Yeah.

02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:30.820
Versus, yeah, I mean, I don't,

02:05:33.020 --> 02:05:34.340
that's tough.

02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:36.980
That's tough because that's like,

02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:42.540
because it's hard for you to remember them as a human.

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:45.860
You remember them as parts.

02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:48.500
For me, that's how I remember him.

02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:50.900
I would like to, I have a picture

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:52.860
that I post every year about him.

02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:54.380
I see that,

02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:00.820
but I don't put two and two to get,

02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:01.820
does that make sense?

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:03.180
Yeah, no, it does.

02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:06.140
So I, even I listening to your story and you know,

02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:08.900
thank you for sharing it first of all, but.

02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:09.980
It's fine.

02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:11.940
It's not my, it's,

02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:13.020
I'm just the one to tell it.

02:06:13.020 --> 02:06:14.180
I was just involved.

02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:18.380
One set of eyes on this particular human being,

02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:21.220
but even I get angry.

02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:24.180
I can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger.

02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.020
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.460
I look always exhausted.

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.300
Oh, that's okay.

02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.740
You're into robotics.

02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:30.660
Isn't that like your guys' thing?

02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:32.060
You guys are just always working on tech.

02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:35.660
I think because I feel so much for the world,

02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:36.780
I just don't do,

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:39.580
we were talking about resting bitch face earlier.

02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:42.620
I just don't feel the need to maintain

02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:44.500
all the effort of the musculature

02:06:44.500 --> 02:06:46.500
for presenting myself to you visually.

02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:47.340
It's exhausting.

02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.180
It's exhausting.

02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:49.340
So I just focus on the feeling.

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:50.180
No, hey, I can.

02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:52.340
And then let the face show whatever the hell it shows.

02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:53.300
Fair enough.

02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:54.140
Okay.

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.140
Was there anger?

02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.860
Was there hate?

02:06:57.860 --> 02:06:58.700
Yeah.

02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:01.700
Can you just talk through your feelings

02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:03.140
of what you remember?

02:07:03.140 --> 02:07:03.980
Yeah.

02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:07.660
So after that operation with the British,

02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.700
I went back to the Canadians

02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:13.300
and I didn't go back as even remotely close

02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:14.740
to who I was when I left.

02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:18.460
And that was really troublesome

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:19.940
for a lot of people around me

02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:23.980
because the level of anger and hate that came out of me

02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:25.900
was palpable when I just walked by.

02:07:28.420 --> 02:07:29.980
I got shockingly quiet.

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:33.460
And you understand how you're learning.

02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:35.340
That'd be terrified if you were quiet.

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:41.340
And I don't know if hate and anger do that justice.

02:07:41.580 --> 02:07:43.180
I don't know another word,

02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:46.780
but I don't think those two words do it justice

02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:48.500
to the extent that I was feeling.

02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:52.460
Like I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:54.460
with some scissors,

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:56.220
like the idea crossed my mind,

02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.180
like I could boot stomp her to death

02:07:58.180 --> 02:07:59.740
and not feel anything about it in front of her,

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:01.540
all of her family and her kids.

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:05.100
Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity

02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:06.780
or was it legit hatred?

02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:08.780
No, it was legit hatred,

02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:12.380
but also I no longer saw those people as humans.

02:08:13.260 --> 02:08:14.620
It took one event.

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:17.380
And when that happened, the rest of the operation

02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:22.380
that was echoed in the way I was to those people.

02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:26.900
But to what level can you see those people as human?

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:30.900
So this is where Jaco shut down.

02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:35.900
I still think I'm right.

02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:40.540
There's a dire straight song called Brothers in Arms.

02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:46.500
And actually, anyway, we're fools to make war

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.340
on our brothers in arms.

02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:51.220
And I brought that up to Jaco

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.620
because it's humans on both sides. Correct.

02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:59.020
But he said not in Iraq.

02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:04.380
Like to him, he's like, no, that's the enemy.

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:07.140
These are people who use the civilians.

02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:11.540
They rape, they torture, they'll do anything

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:13.860
and they put evil into the world.

02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:18.020
And then it's like, so they're stood on at that moment.

02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:23.180
Like these two were humans and it's politicians waging war

02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:26.140
and it's it's kids on both sides.

02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:30.020
But then Jaco was like, no.

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:31.180
He's not wrong.

02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:36.180
So can you carry both things with you as a soldier?

02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:37.860
I think when I was a soldier,

02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:40.340
I could only carry one thing with me.

02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:44.100
I think my perspective has changed drastically,

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:47.900
but not because I've lost the reality

02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:49.700
that they are the enemy,

02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:52.940
but I've gained my humanity back again.

02:09:53.900 --> 02:09:55.980
And that's what I lost when I was there.

02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:57.660
I lost all humanity.

02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:59.420
I lost all hope for humanity.

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:01.140
He's not wrong.

02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:04.980
When he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq,

02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:08.460
but for me, the Taliban are evil.

02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:12.620
I still hold a spot of hatred for them

02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:14.820
that could set this building on fire.

02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:17.420
You don't, I don't know that anybody

02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.500
can fully understand that.

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:23.500
When you watch what they do to women and to kids,

02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:26.780
and they do it in the name of God,

02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:27.940
they are the enemy.

02:10:27.940 --> 02:10:32.100
They are less than, they don't exist.

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:34.700
They're barely worth the bullets we put into them.

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:39.460
But then because they use civilians.

02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:40.660
It gets dicey.

02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:45.100
So like then everybody becomes the enemy.

02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:47.020
And how are you supposed to make sense of that?

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:48.340
Like what?

02:10:48.340 --> 02:10:50.020
You can't, but here, Lex, you can't make sense of it.

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:51.140
This is why.

02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:52.700
They've done a really good job

02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.260
of blending into the civilian population.

02:10:54.260 --> 02:10:55.300
They've done it intentionally.

02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:57.580
They've done it on purpose.

02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.340
So they're brilliant.

02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:00.980
This is why you guys couldn't beat them.

02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:03.340
This is why we couldn't fucking beat them.

02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:07.300
They use their people so effectively.

02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:08.740
They have no shame in that.

02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:10.180
They have no issue with that.

02:11:10.180 --> 02:11:13.220
They take no qualms with wiping a kid

02:11:13.220 --> 02:11:14.580
off the face of the earth.

02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:16.740
If it means they can get close enough to a soldier

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:19.140
to throw a fucking bomb into their tank.

02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.940
This is why they're effective.

02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.740
How do you beat them then?

02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.420
Is this, there's no winning

02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.860
that you just basically do policemen type work

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:31.300
or you do your best.

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:33.220
I mean, that's one way.

02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:38.220
So the other is you come from an artillery background.

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:39.940
A fucking hellfire missile

02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:42.460
and take the whole place off the face of the earth.

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.220
You can't beat radicalism like that right now.

02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:48.780
The problem is we've let it go unchecked.

02:11:48.780 --> 02:11:52.220
We had it kind of in check for 20 years.

02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:55.820
We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest and the face.

02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:00.700
So the problem with force

02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:03.820
is it creates long-term hate

02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:08.820
because young kids in propaganda and like propaganda works.

02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:13.100
So you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.

02:12:14.140 --> 02:12:16.500
It's very easy to convince that person

02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:19.220
that they died because of evil Americans

02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:20.580
and tell whatever story you want

02:12:20.580 --> 02:12:22.180
about America or Canada, Russia.

02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:23.340
That's the biggest problem.

02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:25.940
So it seems like there gotta be better solutions

02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:28.820
because I mean, I talk about love,

02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:33.820
but it's honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways

02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:38.340
of empowering women, of educating people, of like.

02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.180
Yes.

02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.900
And not in a.

02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:43.180
Not in a cheesy way, but in a realistic.

02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:48.180
Like in the same level of like mass warfare, but with love.

02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:53.380
So you're talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets,

02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:55.940
but like do that where you educate

02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:59.580
and empower women by force, you know.

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:00.820
They wanna learn.

02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:01.660
Right.

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:03.620
I mean, you're not like forcing anybody.

02:13:03.620 --> 02:13:04.980
No, but. You're setting them free.

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:05.820
That's exactly it.

02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.380
Like Combat Flip-Lops does this.

02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:08.220
They do this.

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:09.980
They give literacy.

02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:12.620
They teach girls to read, nothing else.

02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:15.700
To read, because as soon as you can read,

02:13:15.700 --> 02:13:16.900
you know what that happens.

02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.100
You know what happens then.

02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:19.380
What's Combat Flip-Lops?

02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:22.180
That's the scarf right there that's made in Afghanistan.

02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:24.940
So when you buy something from them,

02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:28.180
the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.

02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:31.420
They've given literacy to 800 girls over there.

02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:32.540
Yeah, they're really cool.

02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:33.700
Griff owns the one.

02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:35.020
He was an army ranger and his buddy,

02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:37.060
but Lee, I think is his name.

02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:39.940
They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they do shoes.

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:43.420
And I think they're called shmongs, shmongs.

02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:44.540
I don't know how to say it properly.

02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:45.740
Built in Afghanistan.

02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:46.580
Yes.

02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:48.260
And then the proceeds go back there.

02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:51.100
They do great work for literacy.

02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:53.100
And you know, as well as anyone,

02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:54.940
if you can teach someone to read.

02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:55.780
Good color.

02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.340
Dark like your soul, Alex.

02:13:59.740 --> 02:14:00.980
On the inside.

02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:02.260
Just on the inside.

02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:03.100
All right.

02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:06.500
The outside is just the, it's just the suit.

02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:08.220
I feel like you think that's your suit of armor,

02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:10.980
but I feel like it's there.

02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:11.820
See?

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:12.660
What were you saying?

02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:13.740
Sorry, what were you saying?

02:14:13.740 --> 02:14:14.580
I was saying.

02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:15.820
Go on, I will allow this.

02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:16.660
All right.

02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:20.940
I think there is room if you teach education.

02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:24.860
The problem is we've taken a massive step backwards.

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:29.300
I know that the Taliban have just instituted this week.

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:30.740
Honor killings will be back.

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:32.340
Stonings are back.

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:35.140
And dismemberments as well.

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:36.540
Holly McKay is the reporter

02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:37.900
that's been reporting that from the ground.

02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:39.420
She's still there.

02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:42.340
The way to pull people, in my opinion,

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:45.100
out of something like that is through education.

02:14:45.100 --> 02:14:47.540
Well, we just took all of that away.

02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:50.300
Which is pretty horrific in my opinion,

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:53.860
because you've taught over 20 years.

02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:55.500
You're perfectly right, Lex.

02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:59.700
When you say that hate and violence won't work, it won't.

02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:02.500
Because you see dad get killed on the battlefields.

02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:03.740
Well, that 14 year old little boy

02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:06.180
is gonna pick up an AK-47 and go avenge dad's death.

02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:07.660
That's just the way it's gonna be.

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.340
Well, you think about it.

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:10.180
You were there for 20 years.

02:15:10.180 --> 02:15:11.700
There's a couple of generations in there.

02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:14.340
There's another generation that's either grown up in this

02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:16.220
or has seen enough of this.

02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:18.540
So they're always going to be a subset

02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:20.420
that think that we're the enemy.

02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:21.940
And fair.

02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:24.340
We haven't done always the greatest things.

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:25.700
But the one thing that we have done

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:28.580
that I did participate in was giving literacy,

02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:30.740
giving girls an opportunity,

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:33.700
letting them know that you aren't second-class citizens.

02:15:33.700 --> 02:15:35.620
You can do things too.

02:15:35.620 --> 02:15:40.500
And that's why we have to look at war differently.

02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:41.820
There's times for violence.

02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:44.700
Oh, there is time for violence.

02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:48.060
And there is time for missiles

02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:50.900
and there is time for detainees

02:15:50.900 --> 02:15:52.540
and there's times for bagging tags

02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:54.100
and double tops of the fucking face.

02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:55.860
There's times for all of that.

02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:59.460
But there needs to be more time to educate.

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:03.220
The problem is you can't educate if you're in a country

02:16:03.220 --> 02:16:04.900
where the culture doesn't believe in that.

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:07.460
You're fighting so many different things

02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:10.900
that it's almost an impossible situation.

02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:15.180
When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan

02:16:15.180 --> 02:16:16.700
and we just pulled out,

02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:19.220
there's a sudden pull out of troops.

02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:21.580
What do you think about those 20 years?

02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:24.580
Well, let me ask a hard question,

02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:28.980
which is was it worth it going into Afghanistan?

02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:33.500
And you're sort of, you're one person.

02:16:33.540 --> 02:16:35.060
Am I limited capacity?

02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:38.420
You have experienced specific set

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:41.380
of extremely difficult things.

02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:44.020
You've met a lot of humans.

02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:45.860
You understand certain aspects

02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:47.460
of the way this war is carried out.

02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.300
But if you zoomed out at the big story,

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:52.380
like you like history too.

02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:54.380
When you think of the history,

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:55.460
a hundred years from now,

02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:59.500
we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.

02:16:59.500 --> 02:17:01.180
I don't even think you need to go far that back

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:06.180
to know that it was, we went in on false pretenses.

02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:07.500
We did.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:09.260
That's not a good start.

02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:11.420
What's that saying?

02:17:11.420 --> 02:17:14.700
Future behavior is a good,

02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:16.460
was it past behavior is a good indicator

02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:17.300
of future behavior?

02:17:17.300 --> 02:17:18.260
Right.

02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:23.140
So I struggle with that because when I first found out

02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:24.780
that the pull-up was gonna happen,

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:30.940
I got really angry because my government

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:34.340
skated the whole situation because he's having a snap.

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:35.660
Canada's having a snap election.

02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:37.020
It's happening on the 20th.

02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:41.540
So that was beautifully planned by my government

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:46.540
to hold no accountability, zero accountability.

02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:49.020
And the media won't talk about it.

02:17:49.020 --> 02:17:51.220
They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan.

02:17:51.220 --> 02:17:52.620
And then I told them what was going on

02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:54.820
after I talked to my people that were on the ground.

02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.660
And then they canceled the interview.

02:17:56.660 --> 02:18:00.620
When you say my government, is America any better at this?

02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:03.220
It feels like there's no accountability.

02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:06.340
No, no, the government, no, the American government

02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:08.900
is a dumpster fire.

02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:11.500
I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is

02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:18.100
at least they sent people to pull people

02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:20.260
or pull some people.

02:18:20.260 --> 02:18:23.380
We sent no one to pull anyone.

02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:27.060
And I know for a fact, because I helped move a family,

02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:29.180
I was fortunate enough to be given an opportunity

02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:31.660
to help move a high value nine person family

02:18:31.660 --> 02:18:34.660
out of that country that worked in the government,

02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:37.020
that worked in prosecuting the Taliban

02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:38.940
that were on the top of the list.

02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:41.620
I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things.

02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:42.980
And I'm really disgusted by it.

02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:46.060
I learned that Canada had the one email address

02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:49.900
that all Canadian Afghani visa holders were supposed to email.

02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:52.580
Ottawa put two people on that email address.

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:54.860
That's confirmed.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:58.580
Canada put no more than 70 people on the ground

02:18:58.580 --> 02:18:59.940
for that pullout and they were not allowed

02:18:59.940 --> 02:19:01.380
to leave the airport and they left well

02:19:01.380 --> 02:19:02.340
before the pullout date.

02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:04.220
They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday

02:19:04.220 --> 02:19:05.660
that was the 31st.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:09.900
There were high value Canadian visa holders

02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:11.060
that are still in that country

02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:12.540
that are on the top of the kill list.

02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:14.500
Canada is not doing anything about it.

02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:19.140
I'm disgusted in the way my government has acted

02:19:19.140 --> 02:19:22.700
because number one, there's an active lawsuit

02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:25.700
with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.

02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:30.300
We are leaving our vets and our Canadians

02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:33.780
stranded over there and we are leaving the vets

02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:35.940
that have been maimed by this war in Canada.

02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:38.940
They're turned down for everything.

02:19:38.940 --> 02:19:40.260
I've been turned down for hearing loss.

02:19:40.260 --> 02:19:42.740
They're saying it's not military related.

02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:45.060
They have PIs follow me.

02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.340
This is normal behavior.

02:19:47.340 --> 02:19:50.780
There's a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau

02:19:50.780 --> 02:19:53.260
in a meeting that after he lost his leg,

02:19:53.260 --> 02:19:55.580
he was just trying to get a new prosthetic

02:19:55.580 --> 02:19:57.100
because it was just killing him.

02:19:57.100 --> 02:19:58.100
Trudeau stood up in a meeting

02:19:58.100 --> 02:20:00.500
and said, you're just asking for too much.

02:20:00.500 --> 02:20:01.580
Less than six months later,

02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:05.100
he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:07.460
that was in the Canadian prison system.

02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:11.780
He won and got 10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.

02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:13.820
So I don't know that American government's any better,

02:20:13.820 --> 02:20:18.380
but what I do know is that the absolute fucking machines

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:21.220
of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command

02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:25.220
to pull my family out for me, I know they were there.

02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:26.900
The British that stayed on the ground

02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:31.060
that I could contact to literally confirm my biometric data

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:33.700
and passports to get that family moved, they weren't there.

02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:35.660
That family would still be there.

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:37.500
That three-year-old that got the shit kicked out of him

02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:40.700
by the Taliban that I was trying to exfil, Canada left him.

02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:47.180
What is it about politicians and governments

02:20:47.180 --> 02:20:49.020
not willing to-

02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:51.940
Do their job?

02:20:51.940 --> 02:20:56.940
Well, not willing to do that big part of the job,

02:20:57.540 --> 02:21:02.540
which is like you send people to war, these are heroes,

02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:08.340
and then you should spend most of the time

02:21:08.340 --> 02:21:12.300
repaying the debts to those, right?

02:21:12.300 --> 02:21:13.500
Well, what is it about?

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:14.660
Why can't we-

02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:17.900
Because we're disposable numbers,

02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.620
and we hire them out of high school

02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:21.060
when they're stupid enough to not understand

02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:23.140
what they're going to get themselves into,

02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:26.140
and then we blame it on themselves

02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:28.860
for making that decision by volunteering.

02:21:28.860 --> 02:21:31.900
Yeah, but I mean, that still doesn't make sense to me.

02:21:31.900 --> 02:21:32.740
So it's a cop-out.

02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:36.700
I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:41.100
that wants to do good for, I mean, I want to believe

02:21:41.100 --> 02:21:45.060
that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world.

02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:50.060
And it doesn't, like, I don't understand

02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:53.500
the system of delusion you have to live in

02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:55.300
to not understand who the heroes are.

02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:58.580
Like, I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.

02:21:58.580 --> 02:21:59.500
You haven't met him, though, have you?

02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:00.660
I don't, actually.

02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:03.620
I'm speaking about Trudeau without knowing.

02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:06.660
But I mean, in general, think that way about leaders.

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:08.780
I just think they surround themselves

02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:11.060
by people who delude them, who like-

02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:12.180
They're yes people.

02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.220
Yes, people that lead them into a kind of reality

02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:18.740
that becomes detached from actual reality.

02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:21.900
And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.

02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:25.500
They think maybe some kind of special interest.

02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:28.820
They focus on that versus, like, the humans.

02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:30.460
If you look back, was there a way

02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:34.140
we could have done something better in Afghanistan,

02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.380
assuming we do the invasion?

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:40.020
So is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans?

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:45.780
Like, investing more money in the education of women

02:22:48.620 --> 02:22:53.380
and liberating people who are suffering injustice

02:22:53.380 --> 02:22:54.500
in those parts of the world?

02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:55.940
Like, what's a better way to do it?

02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:59.580
And one other aspect is, on the U.S. side,

02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:02.580
paid over $6 trillion for the wars

02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:04.380
in the Middle East since 9-11.

02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.180
So the financial side as well.

02:23:06.180 --> 02:23:07.460
Is there something you can comment

02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:10.660
on things we could have done better?

02:23:11.740 --> 02:23:14.020
That's a loaded question because you're talking

02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:16.740
to someone who had no hand in what happened

02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:18.420
other than do this and do that.

02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:20.180
So I can go from my perspective,

02:23:20.180 --> 02:23:22.580
which is there was probably plenty of things

02:23:22.580 --> 02:23:24.940
that we could have been doing better.

02:23:24.940 --> 02:23:27.660
I think there was a lack of leadership from the get-go.

02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:31.500
I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me

02:23:31.500 --> 02:23:36.500
was nowhere sufficient for a deployment of that level.

02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:38.780
Mind you, things happen.

02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:40.820
They didn't realize things would happen,

02:23:40.820 --> 02:23:42.060
but yet they happen.

02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:47.340
With little to absolutely no cultural idea

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:48.740
was that I was walking into.

02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:52.900
Like when the one male in the family

02:23:52.900 --> 02:23:55.140
grabbed the back of my vest because my hair was tucked

02:23:55.140 --> 02:23:56.620
and he thought it was a man going into a room

02:23:56.620 --> 02:23:57.440
with a bunch of women,

02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:00.140
I couldn't understand why he was attacking me.

02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:02.740
There was no real breakdown of,

02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:04.300
this is what you're going into.

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:05.260
This is the culture.

02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:06.700
This is why they do what they do.

02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:08.940
This is how they do it.

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:11.100
This is how you should handle a situation like that.

02:24:11.100 --> 02:24:13.100
There was none of that.

02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:14.660
And something I speak about frequently

02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:16.180
and I think it's important to acknowledge

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:18.380
is when you're doing any of that training,

02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:20.140
we are giving none of our soldiers

02:24:20.140 --> 02:24:22.340
proper mental health training,

02:24:22.340 --> 02:24:24.980
tools in that fucking toolbox

02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:28.500
or ways or things to look for on their buddy.

02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:31.060
Because we've created a system and a problem

02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.780
where if you say that you're ill

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.820
or that you're struggling with PTSD, you're done.

02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:38.100
No one's gonna say that.

02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.620
They're gonna keep struggling with it.

02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:41.060
And that's when you get loose cannons.

02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:43.020
It's when you get problems happen.

02:24:43.020 --> 02:24:46.780
So you get fractures start to happen in leadership.

02:24:46.780 --> 02:24:50.420
And that's being seen and has been seen now for a while.

02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:53.460
So in terms of what we could have done,

02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:58.460
say for a better way to go into the country,

02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:01.980
a better way to help the country,

02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:06.540
I can't speak to that as much as I wish I could

02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:09.940
because I don't know that I would have all the answers.

02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:11.580
What about withdrawal?

02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:12.660
Oh my God.

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:15.500
That's a cover.

02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:17.300
Do you think more gradual,

02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:21.580
you think it's better to maintain presence there

02:25:21.580 --> 02:25:24.140
for indefinitely?

02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:25.820
I don't know about that.

02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:29.140
But I do know we have bases,

02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:30.540
I say weeks, I serve with them.

02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:32.460
Americans have bases in Japan.

02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:34.260
Americans have bases in Korea.

02:25:34.260 --> 02:25:36.260
Americans have bases in Germany.

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:38.340
There's reasons there's bases everywhere.

02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:42.300
There's an intellectual way to look at this.

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:45.220
You wanna be able to have eyes and ears.

02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:46.820
Can't have eyes and ears

02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:49.140
when you do things like you just did.

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:51.540
The way that we pulled out of that country,

02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:53.820
that's right, I hate saying American British

02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:55.020
because it puts like a blame on them.

02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:58.940
I say we because I'm a soldier, I'm a NATO soldier.

02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:01.660
The way we pulled out of that country,

02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:03.860
my five-year-old could have done it better.

02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:04.940
He could have said, mommy,

02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:08.060
why are we not keeping that Bagram base?

02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:10.260
Mommy, why are we not keeping that base

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:12.540
just until we get everyone else that we need?

02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.340
Why are we going to a civilian airport

02:26:14.340 --> 02:26:16.460
that we don't control, that we don't understand?

02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:17.540
Mommy, why are we doing this

02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:19.140
when there's only one road to it?

02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:23.340
My five-year-old would have that conversation with me.

02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:27.220
It was so poorly done.

02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:29.260
It was so poorly executed

02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.660
and no fault of the soldiers on the ground on their own.

02:26:31.660 --> 02:26:35.060
My God, I can tell you there's operators,

02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:36.100
I just call them A.

02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:38.340
I don't say who he is because he's told me not to.

02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:41.460
There's a guy named A and there's another guy named R

02:26:41.460 --> 02:26:43.540
and there's a few other named D

02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:44.980
and these guys,

02:26:47.500 --> 02:26:51.420
they gave everything to try to pull my family

02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:53.700
when no one else would pull my family for me.

02:26:54.580 --> 02:26:55.620
They just got me on the phone and said,

02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:56.820
I don't know who the fuck you're talking to.

02:26:56.820 --> 02:26:57.860
I don't know how many people you're trying

02:26:57.860 --> 02:26:58.700
to get a hold of here,

02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:00.860
but you've got everyone looking for your family.

02:27:00.860 --> 02:27:02.740
Six, I've gone to everyone I know.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:04.140
I've done stuff on Instagram.

02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:04.980
I've got a contact.

02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:06.220
The contact called me.

02:27:06.220 --> 02:27:07.700
I called them.

02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:10.020
I was handling this family

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:11.740
and when they call you and say,

02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:12.820
we can't go back to the gate,

02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:15.740
my three-year-old just got beat up by the Taliban

02:27:15.740 --> 02:27:17.780
and they say, what do we do now?

02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:20.340
I'm in Vancouver.

02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:23.180
Why am I being left to deal with this?

02:27:23.180 --> 02:27:26.300
Why is the civilian and ex-military population

02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.620
being left to deal with this?

02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:29.460
Why was this not thought out?

02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:31.900
We knew this was coming.

02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:33.420
We knew the timeframe.

02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:35.980
Yeah, I ultimately blame,

02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:38.580
it almost starts at the top always at the leadership.

02:27:38.580 --> 02:27:40.740
Sorry, is this the civilian leadership?

02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:41.580
Always.

02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:43.900
I mean, I think probably the generals

02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:46.260
know the right thing to do here,

02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:48.060
even if they're sometimes overzealous

02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:51.100
in terms of wanting to increase.

02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:53.500
I think the great generals understand what's needed

02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:56.140
and then it takes great leadership on the civilian side

02:27:56.980 --> 02:27:58.940
to listen to the generals and understand

02:27:58.940 --> 02:28:01.300
that war is not just about like-

02:28:01.300 --> 02:28:02.620
It's not binary.

02:28:02.620 --> 02:28:04.420
Yeah, and it's not about the invasion

02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:06.220
and saying mission accomplished.

02:28:07.180 --> 02:28:08.740
It's not about the PR.

02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.980
It's about the full complexity of geopolitics.

02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:14.260
Can I ask you this?

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.380
Can ask me whatever you want.

02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:17.740
I'm looking at a book that you gave me,

02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:18.620
Do the Fucking Work.

02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:19.580
It's very motivating.

02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:21.780
Good Fucking Design Advice.

02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:24.700
That's their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.

02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.540
That's great.

02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:26.380
I know, they're great.

02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:27.380
What's their website because-

02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:28.660
Good GFDA.

02:28:28.660 --> 02:28:32.100
Okay, so the F is for friendship.

02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:33.140
Something like that.

02:28:33.140 --> 02:28:35.300
They are a design company.

02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:36.700
They've worked with Apple and Nike

02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:37.540
and this is their book.

02:28:37.540 --> 02:28:39.300
It's been published by HarperCollins

02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:42.260
and it is really just, it's an incredible,

02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:44.220
they're an incredible company.

02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:47.340
They're artistically, like they're a design company.

02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:48.620
So you can see that.

02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.780
You can see it's a design company.

02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:52.140
Oh yeah, they signed it for you.

02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:53.940
And the pages are beautiful,

02:28:53.940 --> 02:28:56.060
but it's, they have a saying

02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:58.500
and then a paragraph about each saying.

02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:00.140
Get fucking started.

02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:02.300
Obstacles are fucking opportunities.

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.980
Fail, fail and fucking fail again.

02:29:04.980 --> 02:29:07.060
Ask for fucking help.

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.460
Show some fucking passion.

02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:11.620
Finish the fucking job.

02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:12.460
That's right.

02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:13.580
So we should send that to Biden.

02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:15.180
So I-

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:16.540
She said that, I didn't say it.

02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:17.860
Lex said it.

02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:18.940
I didn't say it.

02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:19.780
Lex said it.

02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:20.620
It's fine, I'll say it.

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:21.980
I should also send it to Trudeau as well.

02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:23.860
So, but I mean, he probably wouldn't know how to read it.

02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:25.700
He just taught drama instead.

02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:26.540
So-

02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:29.260
I'll send it to the previous four presidents.

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.100
How about that?

02:29:30.100 --> 02:29:30.940
That's fine.

02:29:30.940 --> 02:29:31.780
We can also send it to them too.

02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:33.220
Cause they're all just as much at fault.

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:34.060
So-

02:29:34.060 --> 02:29:35.980
And they, most of them have all the same last names,

02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:36.820
but okay.

02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:39.620
Let me tell you about them quickly.

02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:41.180
Cause we did a mug with them

02:29:41.180 --> 02:29:42.340
and I was really excited about it.

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:43.300
Not because it was a mug.

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:45.460
I'm a mug person, but-

02:29:45.460 --> 02:29:46.300
You are, that's your-

02:29:46.300 --> 02:29:47.140
Oh, I'm a mug obsess.

02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:48.300
I'm obsessive about my mugs.

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:49.900
What's your favorite mug?

02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:51.060
Currently it's mine right now.

02:29:51.060 --> 02:29:52.500
The one that I have with them.

02:29:52.500 --> 02:29:53.340
Okay.

02:29:53.860 --> 02:29:55.420
What does it say on it?

02:29:55.420 --> 02:29:57.460
Can I, do you want me to read what it says on it?

02:29:57.460 --> 02:29:58.300
Yeah, please.

02:29:58.300 --> 02:29:59.140
Okay.

02:29:59.140 --> 02:29:59.980
Cause I'm really happy about it

02:29:59.980 --> 02:30:04.700
because we created this with them, with GFDA.

02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:07.700
I found out about them because my husband's office,

02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:10.420
Atlas Neck Brace, he had his very first office,

02:30:10.420 --> 02:30:12.060
he had one of their prints done.

02:30:12.060 --> 02:30:15.540
And it was their original like do the fucking work.

02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:18.660
And I was really excited about them once I found out

02:30:18.660 --> 02:30:22.100
because I'm like, well, fuck is my middle name.

02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:26.820
And I want to make sure that I am going to,

02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:27.940
whoever I work with,

02:30:27.940 --> 02:30:29.740
I want to make sure that I'm working with people

02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:34.060
that I believe in, that I believe what they stand for.

02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:36.340
And I just think they're brilliant.

02:30:36.340 --> 02:30:39.620
So I got on the phone with them and I said, hi,

02:30:39.620 --> 02:30:41.940
I would like you to sponsor my podcast.

02:30:41.940 --> 02:30:44.300
And they said, cool, what's your podcast?

02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:47.260
And I was like, it's called Brass in Unity podcast.

02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:49.500
And I want to work with you guys somewhere.

02:30:49.500 --> 02:30:52.300
And they're like, okay, so like, what are you thinking?

02:30:52.300 --> 02:30:55.300
And I said, you know, I'm looking to do,

02:30:55.300 --> 02:30:57.020
I would love one day to do something with you.

02:30:57.020 --> 02:30:57.900
I don't know what it would be,

02:30:57.900 --> 02:31:00.340
but I would like it to be something.

02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:02.700
And they said, you know, we do like, we have this book,

02:31:02.700 --> 02:31:04.100
but we also have like shirts and mugs

02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:06.260
with our sayings on them and prints.

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:07.820
And so I was thinking to myself, I was like,

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:11.100
well, if I just did like a mug with them,

02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:12.140
well, then I could, you know,

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:14.660
that could work for what my company does,

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:16.940
which is it's a jewelry company and sunglass company,

02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:19.180
but it could be like an add-on kind of deal.

02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:22.180
These guys are really good designers, I can already tell.

02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:24.420
Yeah, I knew you would like it, that's why I brought it.

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:27.100
So I'm like, certain people would appreciate this.

02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:32.100
And so my whole thing, my like hashtag is work hard,

02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:33.620
help harder.

02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:35.780
And that's the whole concept of what I do now.

02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:38.740
And so we did a mug and it's called fucking help somebody.

02:31:38.740 --> 02:31:40.220
That's their like first tag.

02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:44.660
And then the rest is kindness is a wealth that increases

02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.300
as it is given away.

02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:49.500
What you get in return isn't passed between hands,

02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:51.020
but felt between hearts.

02:31:51.020 --> 02:31:53.980
It's precisely because you've been at the bottom

02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:55.340
that you can raise others up.

02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:58.860
It's because you've, sorry, I'm reading a photo here.

02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:00.140
You've been lost in the dark.

02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:02.300
You can lead others to the light.

02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:04.660
It's because you've fought with yourself

02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:06.700
that you can bring peace to someone else.

02:32:07.780 --> 02:32:10.340
You now have the strength because you've once struggled.

02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:14.460
The best you have to come from

02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:16.780
is the fucking worst you've had to take.

02:32:16.780 --> 02:32:20.020
So this is the mug there and we're sold out of them.

02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:20.860
We just got a bunch.

02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:22.020
What does it say, fucking help?

02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:23.420
Fucking help somebody.

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:24.860
Fucking help somebody.

02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:28.340
And so we did, they were so gracious enough

02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:29.500
to sit with me and be like,

02:32:29.500 --> 02:32:30.860
what do you want the copy to be like?

02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:33.100
And I said, what do you think I want it to be?

02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:34.660
Like, what would you, if you could write one for me,

02:32:34.660 --> 02:32:35.500
what would it be?

02:32:35.500 --> 02:32:37.300
And they're like, it's gonna be around lifting people up.

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:38.940
And I was like, okay, cool.

02:32:38.980 --> 02:32:40.380
And they're like, do you want fuck in the title?

02:32:40.380 --> 02:32:43.340
And I was like, every other word, if we can have it.

02:32:43.340 --> 02:32:44.620
And they said, we'll just do once.

02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:46.420
And I was like, okay, I compromise.

02:32:46.420 --> 02:32:49.460
And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug

02:32:49.460 --> 02:32:50.660
and we're gonna be doing a shirt with them.

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:55.140
But the whole thing to me was that that embodied

02:32:56.180 --> 02:32:59.420
what I stand for now and the healing I've gotten to now

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:01.820
and the point I've gotten to now in my life

02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:05.900
because that fucking sand pit almost broke me.

02:33:06.700 --> 02:33:10.820
Like off the face of the earth broke me.

02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:13.860
First of all, can we go through the full journey of that

02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:17.140
in terms of your psychological development?

02:33:17.140 --> 02:33:20.860
Who were you before, who were you after?

02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:22.460
Can you think about that?

02:33:22.460 --> 02:33:27.220
Like, what was your, if you had to put a brain on the table

02:33:27.220 --> 02:33:29.700
before and after and try to analyze it.

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:31.020
Well, they both have CTE.

02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:33.620
So we know that they're both bruised

02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:36.140
and gray matter's a little dicey on them.

02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:40.780
And it may sound the same and it's not.

02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:42.380
So I'll try to explain it to you.

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:46.420
Before that, don't you laugh because I know it's coming.

02:33:47.940 --> 02:33:52.500
I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.

02:33:52.500 --> 02:33:53.940
I know, it's hard to believe.

02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:57.020
This is you humble and quiet right now.

02:33:59.740 --> 02:34:01.060
This is normal me now.

02:34:01.060 --> 02:34:02.860
This is who I am now and I love that.

02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:04.540
Who I was before was,

02:34:08.700 --> 02:34:12.540
motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.

02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:14.940
I didn't know how to dress.

02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:16.940
I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans

02:34:16.940 --> 02:34:17.780
and t-shirt all the time,

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:20.420
that was like acceptable behavior as a woman.

02:34:20.420 --> 02:34:22.020
I wore skate shoes.

02:34:22.020 --> 02:34:25.620
I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear skirt at.

02:34:25.620 --> 02:34:26.460
I wore pants.

02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:27.900
I played hacky sack.

02:34:27.900 --> 02:34:30.380
I was so into sports.

02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:32.540
I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.

02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:34.700
We heated our house that way.

02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:35.940
I would go on the transport.

02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:39.500
I stayed at a trouble for the most part.

02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:43.300
I think I was a fairly good kid.

02:34:43.300 --> 02:34:44.420
I was pretty angry though

02:34:44.420 --> 02:34:46.780
for most of my teenage life after my coach.

02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:48.660
I lost my way a little bit there.

02:34:49.740 --> 02:34:52.460
I was just crazier.

02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:53.500
But happy?

02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:55.540
I don't know if I was happy.

02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:56.980
I'm realizing that now.

02:34:56.980 --> 02:35:00.620
I think anger overtook who I was

02:35:00.620 --> 02:35:02.820
and I think that's why I was such an angry individual

02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:04.500
towards my parents when I was in high school.

02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:08.900
So parents, was it a little rough relationship with parents?

02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:09.740
I mean, yeah.

02:35:09.740 --> 02:35:12.500
I mean, my dad was gone a couple of weeks at a time.

02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:14.260
So my mom stayed home.

02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:16.020
Mom had to handle me and my brother.

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:19.260
We were both competitive athletes at the time by herself.

02:35:19.260 --> 02:35:21.500
And when you come home and you have a daughter

02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:23.380
that just calls you like a bitch to your face

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:25.780
because she's being bullied so bad

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.940
that she can't understand why,

02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:31.060
but also doesn't know how to fix it,

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:32.660
but it has no other outlet anymore

02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:35.060
to kind of get rid of it.

02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:36.100
I was not nice.

02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.340
I was a really mean person.

02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:38.460
I broke my mom.

02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:40.140
I remember the day she stopped yelling.

02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:41.300
That's the day I know I broke her.

02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:42.420
I broke her.

02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:44.780
Did you have a source of discipline in your life?

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:47.860
Like maybe like your dad,

02:35:47.860 --> 02:35:50.020
somebody who says you're being a bitch.

02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:52.740
Oh, like who would call me like that?

02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:53.660
Oh no, no, no, no.

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:54.500
My parents were incredible.

02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:57.380
Like my dad came from like a family of like a bajillion kids

02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:01.060
who lived in a farm with no running water, with like super.

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:03.580
My dad was brash and abrupt.

02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:05.500
So like I've caught myself doing that once in a while.

02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:07.580
So like if I did one thing wrong,

02:36:07.580 --> 02:36:10.420
if he was just in a mood, I would know it.

02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:13.460
So you weren't, okay.

02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:15.780
So that anger just took different forms.

02:36:15.780 --> 02:36:16.700
It took different forms,

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.820
but it mostly would be directed at my mom.

02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:19.660
Got it.

02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:20.580
Because I know she would take it.

02:36:20.580 --> 02:36:21.420
Right.

02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:22.580
And that was who I had.

02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:24.420
And I feel bad about it to the day.

02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:27.300
Like I still, she listened to the Jocko podcast.

02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:29.100
And so did my dad.

02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:29.940
And my mom promised me she would never read my book

02:36:29.940 --> 02:36:30.780
because there's certain parts.

02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:32.860
I just, my dad on my deployment,

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.980
when I called him and told him some of the stuff,

02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:35.820
he started crying.

02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:37.060
My dad doesn't cry.

02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:40.380
And he just said, please never tell your mother this.

02:36:40.380 --> 02:36:41.580
Don't do that to your mom.

02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:44.500
My mom, like my grandfather came from Hungary.

02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.940
He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.

02:36:49.340 --> 02:36:53.260
He wasn't great as a dad.

02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:55.260
My mom went through a lot as a kid.

02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:59.740
And that was because her dad was in the war.

02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:02.660
That was because her dad didn't know any better.

02:37:02.660 --> 02:37:06.380
And she knew she couldn't be like that.

02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:08.180
So her way would be yelling.

02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:13.140
And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down.

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:14.620
I broke her.

02:37:14.620 --> 02:37:17.020
Shattered her ability to think that she could

02:37:18.180 --> 02:37:20.020
have any sort of relationship with me.

02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:22.780
You wouldn't want to have had a relationship with me.

02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:26.420
But the funny thing is you've rediscovered that now.

02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:29.020
So is she, are you guys close now?

02:37:29.020 --> 02:37:31.660
Yeah, she's so funny.

02:37:31.660 --> 02:37:33.300
She's coming out to help out again.

02:37:33.300 --> 02:37:35.900
She comes out to help out with Jack all the time.

02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:39.900
And my dad, they're still truck drivers.

02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:40.740
They're still on the road.

02:37:40.740 --> 02:37:41.580
They team drive.

02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:42.980
They have their little dogs and they go

02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:43.980
and they do their thing.

02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:46.020
And I've had that relationship.

02:37:46.020 --> 02:37:48.500
Now it's still strenuous.

02:37:48.500 --> 02:37:50.540
Like I still, when I'm having a hard time,

02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:52.460
she'll be the person I'll take it out on.

02:37:52.460 --> 02:37:53.820
Because I know she can take it,

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.100
even though I know I shouldn't.

02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:57.420
It's like, she's my safe space to be like,

02:37:58.660 --> 02:38:00.420
blah, about everything.

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:01.900
And she'll just be like, well, that's not nice.

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:03.020
I'm like, well, you're not, fuck it.

02:38:03.020 --> 02:38:04.740
Like I, and I'll take it out on her.

02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:06.900
She knows I don't mean it and I try.

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:12.300
But for whatever reason, she just, she takes it and-

02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:13.540
And it brings it out of you.

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:14.380
Yeah.

02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:16.980
Can you describe sort of the various characteristics,

02:38:16.980 --> 02:38:20.740
the shape of your PTSD, the trauma,

02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:23.660
how the anger and hate took shape in you

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:28.660
in the seconds, minutes, hours, months, years after,

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:32.100
and after the full trauma of all the things

02:38:32.100 --> 02:38:33.860
you've experienced in Afghanistan?

02:38:33.860 --> 02:38:36.260
So it's funny because Jaco asked me something

02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.220
and it made me, it's made me,

02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.180
I've really been thinking a lot about it.

02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.660
And he's like, do you think if somebody of a leadership

02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:45.820
would have just sat you down and said,

02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:50.380
hey, Burns, what you're feeling is okay.

02:38:50.380 --> 02:38:52.020
What you're feeling is normal.

02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.740
What you're feeling is what happens

02:38:54.740 --> 02:38:56.660
when you're in something like this.

02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.780
Do you think you would be where you are?

02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.700
And I said, well, I thought about it.

02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:02.980
And I'm like, you know, I don't think I would be

02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:05.700
because I wouldn't have been medicated out of my mind.

02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:07.900
I wasn't able to process anything

02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:11.060
because I was just given medication right from the get.

02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:14.060
So for me, what happened was once that light switch was off,

02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:17.980
I was sent back to Kandahar to,

02:39:17.980 --> 02:39:20.340
once the operation was over, we flew back to Kandahar.

02:39:21.300 --> 02:39:22.300
Like with the Brits.

02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:24.300
And then because there was deaths

02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:26.340
and we lost people on that operation,

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:28.460
I had to go to the British side for the next,

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:31.820
I think three or four days and recant word for word

02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:34.540
why, what happened to a British MP

02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:36.220
who hand wrote statements.

02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:37.500
But we had to do that on repeat

02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:39.580
to make sure we all had the same story.

02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:42.300
Nobody shot anybody in the back, it's blah.

02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:46.020
And so that I don't think is a great way to do that

02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:47.340
after an after action.

02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:48.580
After action reports happen,

02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:50.860
but I don't think beating a dead horse

02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:53.340
and having somebody repeat, repeat, repeat,

02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:55.460
and then just imprint more and more and more.

02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.060
I don't know that that is a great way of doing that.

02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:03.380
Especially from a perspective of what are the liability,

02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:05.740
almost like legal, that perspective

02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:08.860
as opposed to the full perspective.

02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:11.660
I mean, so for people who don't know,

02:40:11.660 --> 02:40:16.660
one is the over medication that you had to undergo.

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:20.940
And then the other is the social isolation in terms of,

02:40:20.940 --> 02:40:24.940
I mean, more than what Jaco, what you just mentioned,

02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:30.860
you also kind of mentioned that just being with other soldiers

02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:33.540
you're close with, just sitting there in silence

02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:38.220
and just sitting in that shared understanding,

02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:42.060
even that in itself communicates like,

02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:44.300
these feelings are normal.

02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:45.140
Like you don't have to talk.

02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:48.340
And you were robbed of that as well, essentially.

02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:50.420
Yeah, because I was borrowed.

02:40:50.420 --> 02:40:52.980
I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.

02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:55.780
It was like, there was like a, I don't know what they call us,

02:40:55.780 --> 02:40:56.860
but it's like when you take a person

02:40:56.860 --> 02:40:58.540
and you put them in another unit, there's a name for it.

02:40:58.540 --> 02:40:59.980
I don't remember what it was.

02:40:59.980 --> 02:41:02.220
You never see those people again.

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:03.980
But because I was in Kandahar,

02:41:03.980 --> 02:41:05.300
the doctors gave me the medication

02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:08.060
because I think I was the one who said,

02:41:08.060 --> 02:41:10.420
this isn't right, I don't feel right, this is wrong.

02:41:10.420 --> 02:41:12.220
Because when I got back that night,

02:41:12.220 --> 02:41:13.860
I was like, I don't know what to do.

02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:15.180
When I got back that night,

02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:17.460
there was supposed to be somebody there to pick me up

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:18.740
to take me to the other side of the base

02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:20.220
and no one showed.

02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:23.740
So I hummed on my kit back to the Canada house

02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:25.540
and I remember getting in the shower.

02:41:26.500 --> 02:41:31.460
And the rule was quick fucking showers, no water.

02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:34.580
I must've sat on that floor of that shower

02:41:34.580 --> 02:41:36.220
for half an hour, 45 minutes.

02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:40.340
I just held myself and cried.

02:41:40.340 --> 02:41:41.500
I didn't even know why I was crying.

02:41:41.500 --> 02:41:43.660
I just knew I needed to cry.

02:41:44.220 --> 02:41:45.540
I still this day, I...

02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:51.180
And when they sent me back to the FOB,

02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.460
they sent me back with all this medication

02:41:53.460 --> 02:41:56.100
after spending that time with the Brits.

02:41:57.580 --> 02:41:59.500
And they put me back on the guns

02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:01.340
medicated out of my fucking tree.

02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:03.500
I almost shot someone.

02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:05.940
But they didn't tell my staff that I was on meds.

02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:08.980
So when the artillery gun was going off

02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:09.980
and I didn't run to the gun

02:42:09.980 --> 02:42:12.340
and I was still asleep inside the tent

02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:13.940
with the gun beside my head,

02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:16.900
they didn't know I was just drugged.

02:42:16.900 --> 02:42:18.780
They just thought I was fucking off somewhere

02:42:18.780 --> 02:42:20.140
hanging out with some Americans.

02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:21.700
They just thought I wasn't doing

02:42:21.700 --> 02:42:23.900
any of what I should be doing.

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:26.580
And then I remember the moment, my sergeant,

02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:28.860
we did a night shoot and he's so funny

02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:29.700
because he called me and goes,

02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.900
I fucked Burns, I remember this, yes.

02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:35.540
You were standing there with me and I look at you

02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:37.860
and go, hey Burns, are you okay?

02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:39.700
Because your eyes are all fucked.

02:42:42.820 --> 02:42:44.940
I looked at Sergeant LeBlanc and I just remember going,

02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:46.620
yeah, I'm good.

02:42:46.620 --> 02:42:48.220
Like just, huh, good.

02:42:49.940 --> 02:42:51.100
He's like, I still remember that.

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:52.140
And I'm like, I know.

02:42:52.140 --> 02:42:54.140
And he goes, they never tell me anything.

02:42:54.140 --> 02:42:57.780
Fuck Burns, I did not know the drugs you were on.

02:42:57.780 --> 02:42:58.860
And as I was on all of them, he goes,

02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:01.420
I know I walk in, you show me the bottles.

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:03.980
Fuck Burns, you shouldn't have been there.

02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.700
I guarantee he sounds just like that.

02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:07.540
You'll find out.

02:43:07.540 --> 02:43:08.700
It's great.

02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:09.700
He's brilliant.

02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:10.700
He's brilliant.

02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:15.740
Yeah, so what, I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:18.620
of dealing with trauma.

02:43:18.620 --> 02:43:21.500
And for the military, in some sense,

02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:23.180
if you don't have a good program in place,

02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:24.820
this makes sense.

02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:26.380
But you should have a good program in place,

02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:29.940
just like you said, on the prep, on the mental prep side.

02:43:30.820 --> 02:43:31.900
Just any prep.

02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:34.900
Like training people, training people on the,

02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:38.100
I suppose to, I guess, train the fact

02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:41.940
that you're going to have somebody close to you blow up.

02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:44.980
Like you have to probably visualize that.

02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:46.340
You have to think through that.

02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:48.500
You have to have a process of how to deal

02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:51.540
with something like that, with that kind of trauma.

02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:52.380
And then that's it.

02:43:52.380 --> 02:43:54.100
Tools in the toolbox is what the doctors call it.

02:43:54.100 --> 02:43:54.940
Exactly.

02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:56.980
I mean, and it's not like weakness.

02:43:56.980 --> 02:43:57.980
It's actually strength.

02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:02.260
It's like you have to be mentally strong enough

02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:03.780
to process that.

02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:07.060
That probably takes a lot of training,

02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:09.260
but it's a great training, right?

02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:13.100
Well worth it to protect your investment training.

02:44:13.100 --> 02:44:13.940
Right.

02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:16.660
That's a very cold, but correct way to put it.

02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:18.340
I mean, it's cold.

02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:20.180
I thought you would appreciate the coldness

02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:22.580
of the way I articulated that.

02:44:22.580 --> 02:44:23.420
Well, yeah.

02:44:23.420 --> 02:44:25.620
I mean, I'm of two minds in this.

02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:26.460
I don't,

02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:32.140
I sometimes wonder what I would be like as a soldier,

02:44:32.140 --> 02:44:33.460
actually, I don't know.

02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.500
Because I love country

02:44:34.500 --> 02:44:36.860
and I love all the things you're mentioning.

02:44:37.660 --> 02:44:40.340
Like I could see myself probably dying for my country

02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:42.620
and also enjoying the skill of it.

02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:46.660
The very like OCD.

02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:47.860
It'd be very proficient.

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:48.700
Yeah.

02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:50.860
But then also the human side,

02:44:52.060 --> 02:44:53.340
I fall in love with people.

02:44:53.340 --> 02:44:54.460
I fall in love with everything.

02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:56.220
So I don't know.

02:44:56.220 --> 02:44:59.660
I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain

02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:01.540
when you're executing a mission

02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.180
that cares about other humans

02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:08.380
outside your close knit group.

02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:11.900
Like there's no time for philosophical thinking.

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:12.740
I don't know.

02:45:12.740 --> 02:45:16.140
I suppose that's why it's better to be young.

02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:17.460
Young and dumb.

02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:19.140
You're not necessarily dumb.

02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:24.140
It's just like you were over that energy of excitement

02:45:24.140 --> 02:45:27.100
of proficiency and excellence

02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:30.220
is just higher than it is later in life.

02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:31.460
Sure.

02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.740
You're not dumb.

02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:34.860
I was not dumb,

02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:39.060
but I was naive, uneducated,

02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:40.620
not well-trained,

02:45:41.780 --> 02:45:46.420
and had an arrogance

02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:49.380
because we were told we were the fucking shit.

02:45:49.380 --> 02:45:50.220
Yeah.

02:45:50.220 --> 02:45:51.380
You're amazing.

02:45:51.380 --> 02:45:52.700
Okay, I'm amazing.

02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:56.300
So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training?

02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:57.460
That makes you weak.

02:45:57.460 --> 02:46:00.180
Do you think the military thinks that makes you weak?

02:46:00.180 --> 02:46:01.540
Well, yes.

02:46:01.540 --> 02:46:03.940
And the reason I can say that is because it's obvious

02:46:03.940 --> 02:46:05.700
in the way that they handle it now.

02:46:05.700 --> 02:46:06.980
So like if a soldier says,

02:46:06.980 --> 02:46:09.500
hey, I'm really struggling with that last op we were on, man.

02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:10.900
It's just really, it's getting to me.

02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:13.580
I'm having a hard time sleeping.

02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:14.420
They're gonna go,

02:46:15.380 --> 02:46:19.620
okay, well, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?

02:46:19.620 --> 02:46:21.020
And then you get that read and you go,

02:46:21.020 --> 02:46:22.820
oh no, it's not that bad.

02:46:22.820 --> 02:46:24.540
I don't need anything for it.

02:46:24.540 --> 02:46:26.100
Like I'm just like once in a while I'm losing some sleep.

02:46:26.100 --> 02:46:27.340
They're like, okay.

02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:29.540
Because you know that pen moves,

02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:30.700
it's all getting written down

02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:32.300
and then you're dead red,

02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:34.020
which means you're not deploying again.

02:46:34.020 --> 02:46:35.900
And then you're not able to do the thing you love the most

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:37.420
with the people you love the most.

02:46:37.420 --> 02:46:40.780
Right, I mean, but also this is really difficult

02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:44.500
and I'd love to talk to you about PTSD, but like-

02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:45.740
Sorry, yes, I keep going off.

02:46:45.740 --> 02:46:46.820
No, please.

02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:52.900
So I'm hoping to

02:46:57.260 --> 02:47:00.580
launch a company in the engineering space

02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:05.060
and I currently lead a few people.

02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:06.860
And it's always this kind of,

02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:11.500
like how much are you supposed to push people?

02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:15.340
Because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.

02:47:15.340 --> 02:47:17.060
Are you quoting our text messages from earlier?

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:18.580
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

02:47:18.580 --> 02:47:21.140
I'm quoting, all I have is just quotes from you.

02:47:21.140 --> 02:47:21.980
That's okay.

02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:24.780
Tells me how much we've spoken in the past week,

02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:26.620
you poor soul.

02:47:26.620 --> 02:47:28.500
I just, I don't know what to do

02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:31.180
because sometimes people are really struggling.

02:47:31.180 --> 02:47:33.500
Like really struggling in a way they're being,

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:37.740
they're like, it's the Goggins thing is like,

02:47:37.740 --> 02:47:40.220
where's the line to where you're actually breaking

02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:44.140
the human being versus where you're breaking them

02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:47.700
at the places where they will grow back stronger.

02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:52.340
Like, so in that line is tricky to truly understand.

02:47:52.340 --> 02:47:55.060
I think the military arrows on the side of like,

02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:59.660
they, you know, like push them beyond all limits.

02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:00.580
Physical limits.

02:48:00.580 --> 02:48:02.220
Physical, but mental they don't,

02:48:02.220 --> 02:48:04.260
they need to respect the mental more.

02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:06.100
They fuck with the brain a little bit.

02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:08.420
I mean, in basic training, they like scream in your face

02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:09.540
and to see who's gonna crack.

02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:12.780
And they put you on sleep deprivation to see who's weak

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:14.860
enough that they can't handle sleep deprivation.

02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:16.180
They do stuff to you.

02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:17.980
Like, I know if you're a downed pilot,

02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:20.580
you have to go and you have to do this training

02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:22.180
and like it's, you'll get captured.

02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:23.420
It's like this whole thing.

02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:27.780
I mean, they fuck with your brain, but there's a line.

02:48:27.780 --> 02:48:29.380
There's a line.

02:48:29.380 --> 02:48:34.380
My issue is go to the line, cross the line,

02:48:34.740 --> 02:48:38.500
give them the tools to come back from the line.

02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:39.340
Yeah.

02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:40.260
We don't do that.

02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:43.260
We don't, we know there's PTSD.

02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:44.860
We know there's a such a thing.

02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:46.500
We understand there's anxiety and depression.

02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:48.100
We understand there's major depressive disorder.

02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:51.020
We understand that there are precursors.

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:52.300
There are signs and symptoms.

02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:54.180
We understand that.

02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:58.740
So why are we not building enough of a toolkit?

02:48:58.740 --> 02:49:00.900
Whether that be, I'm not talking medication.

02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:03.900
I'm talking, it sounds woo woo,

02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:06.300
but fucking trust me, it works.

02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:08.300
I'm talking meditation.

02:49:08.300 --> 02:49:09.860
I'm talking yoga.

02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:11.980
I'm talking about peer group support.

02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:15.020
I'm talking about if you go to your doctor and report this,

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:16.860
there's, you're not automatically

02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:18.820
gonna be losing your job.

02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:20.700
Why aren't we giving the proper tools

02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:22.180
and the education needed?

02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:25.340
These things are not difficult to teach.

02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:26.660
They don't take a lot of time.

02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:28.100
They don't take a lot of money.

02:49:28.100 --> 02:49:29.500
The only time it takes a lot of money

02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:30.940
is when you want to medicate.

02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:33.060
We don't need to medicate you yet.

02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:34.780
You only need to be medicated if you're a danger

02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:36.340
to someone else or yourself.

02:49:36.340 --> 02:49:38.900
And most of the time, because of the way the system is set,

02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:41.340
you'll lie about it through your fucking teeth,

02:49:41.340 --> 02:49:43.100
just so that no one touches you.

02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:45.220
So from the perspective of the military,

02:49:45.220 --> 02:49:48.340
do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker

02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:50.420
and do all the mental work?

02:49:50.660 --> 02:49:53.940
Some of the baddest dudes I've ever known

02:49:53.940 --> 02:49:56.340
are like, I gotta go to yoga.

02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:57.780
I gotta go meditate.

02:49:57.780 --> 02:49:59.420
I go do Aya with those guys.

02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:00.260
Why?

02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:01.980
Because they know that that's not okay

02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:03.420
to be like that in your life.

02:50:04.820 --> 02:50:07.540
Can you answer the ridiculously big question

02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:09.740
of what is PTSD?

02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.700
Like, do you understand the basic characteristics of it?

02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:16.140
Is there universal characteristics

02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:18.860
from your own unique experience?

02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:21.460
Like from what you've understood about it?

02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:22.300
Yeah, of course there are.

02:50:22.300 --> 02:50:25.500
So there's the basic things that a doctor looks for

02:50:25.500 --> 02:50:27.460
when they're diagnosing PTSD.

02:50:27.460 --> 02:50:28.300
I'm not a doctor.

02:50:28.300 --> 02:50:29.900
Let me make that fucking clear.

02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:32.220
But there are things that you look for.

02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:33.940
You look for insomnia.

02:50:33.940 --> 02:50:36.020
You look for anger and aggression.

02:50:36.020 --> 02:50:38.140
You look for people to fly off the handle.

02:50:38.140 --> 02:50:40.620
You look for avoidance.

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:42.580
You can tell in somebody's body.

02:50:42.580 --> 02:50:44.660
People who can't sleep, if you can't sleep,

02:50:44.660 --> 02:50:47.060
you know that after a certain amount of time,

02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:49.460
they're just gonna deteriorate.

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:51.820
You know, sleeplessness, triggers.

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:53.860
When you say avoidance, do you mean?

02:50:53.860 --> 02:50:54.700
Avoidance.

02:50:54.700 --> 02:50:56.820
So like when I first got back to Canada,

02:50:56.820 --> 02:50:59.020
I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern.

02:50:59.020 --> 02:51:00.580
At all costs.

02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:03.220
No matter how much of a difference it made in my day,

02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:04.380
if I had to not go somewhere

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:06.020
for one of the greatest events of my life,

02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:07.540
I wouldn't have went.

02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:09.020
But isn't there some aspect

02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:10.740
that are combined with the triggers?

02:51:10.740 --> 02:51:13.300
Like maybe it's wise to avoid triggers

02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:16.020
even like for your own personal health, wellbeing.

02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:16.860
Well, that's it.

02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:18.980
For me, that was one of my triggers.

02:51:18.980 --> 02:51:20.580
So that you have triggers.

02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:24.420
And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.

02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:25.340
You can tell.

02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:26.700
You can tell when someone's triggered.

02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:28.580
A lot of vets don't like fireworks.

02:51:28.580 --> 02:51:29.420
It's like, well, Kate,

02:51:29.420 --> 02:51:31.500
we'll remove yourself from the situation.

02:51:31.500 --> 02:51:35.140
So there's other things within PTSD

02:51:35.140 --> 02:51:36.860
that kind of rear its head

02:51:36.860 --> 02:51:40.260
that with PTSD kind of attach other things.

02:51:40.260 --> 02:51:42.380
So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD,

02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:43.380
it was like four years later,

02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:46.020
I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:48.780
And that was kind of a compilation of things

02:51:48.780 --> 02:51:50.660
that was just like a shit show there.

02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:52.060
What is major depressive disorder?

02:51:52.060 --> 02:51:52.980
Good question.

02:51:54.660 --> 02:51:56.100
Is there an answer?

02:51:56.100 --> 02:51:56.940
I don't have one.

02:51:56.940 --> 02:51:58.220
I was told I had it.

02:51:59.300 --> 02:52:04.300
Okay, so I mean, what does your mind go through?

02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:06.660
Where are the places?

02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:07.740
That my mind goes?

02:52:07.740 --> 02:52:09.740
Your mind goes.

02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:11.340
Like the dark places when I get triggered

02:52:11.340 --> 02:52:13.060
and when it was like really bad?

02:52:13.060 --> 02:52:13.900
Yeah. Okay.

02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:14.740
Yeah.

02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:17.580
So you thought about suicide.

02:52:17.580 --> 02:52:18.940
Every minute of every day.

02:52:19.860 --> 02:52:23.460
What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?

02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:26.380
At that time, the pros were

02:52:26.380 --> 02:52:28.900
no one has to deal with this anymore.

02:52:28.900 --> 02:52:31.180
I don't have to feel this way anymore.

02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:33.140
I'm a burden to my family.

02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:35.900
I'm a burden to the military system.

02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:37.580
I'm weak.

02:52:37.580 --> 02:52:39.180
I'm a bad soldier.

02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:40.980
I didn't do my job.

02:52:40.980 --> 02:52:42.380
I don't deserve to be alive.

02:52:42.380 --> 02:52:45.220
I don't deserve Veterans Affairs support.

02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:47.740
I don't deserve, my parents don't deserve

02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:49.300
to watch me go through this.

02:52:49.300 --> 02:52:51.340
The guy I was dating didn't deserve to put up

02:52:51.340 --> 02:52:54.060
with the bullshit I put him through.

02:52:54.060 --> 02:52:57.300
The people who drive with me in cars didn't deserve

02:52:57.300 --> 02:52:59.740
to almost hit medians because I swerved

02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:01.300
because of a piece of garbage.

02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:05.020
People didn't deserve my racist outburst.

02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:07.820
People didn't deserve, people didn't,

02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:10.340
I did not deserve to be breathing anymore.

02:53:10.340 --> 02:53:12.900
I should have died there and I wished I died there.

02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:17.180
So, self-hate there too.

02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:21.420
Oh, just a monochrome, not even a big deal though, right?

02:53:23.180 --> 02:53:24.580
That's at the core of it.

02:53:24.580 --> 02:53:29.580
That's like this, so how do you escape from that place?

02:53:30.340 --> 02:53:34.500
How do you overcome that depression essentially

02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:37.100
at the core of the desire to kill yourself?

02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:42.140
What basic principles, I mean, we could talk about Ayahuasca

02:53:42.780 --> 02:53:46.580
but basic principles of like literally like,

02:53:46.580 --> 02:53:48.620
how do you escape that moment?

02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:52.220
Yeah, previous to any of that, I did from 2009.

02:53:52.220 --> 02:53:54.940
I got out, so I was medically, I was 3B medical,

02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:58.300
honorable discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011.

02:53:58.300 --> 02:53:59.900
So I left the military then.

02:53:59.900 --> 02:54:02.740
And so it's been 10 years, just over 10 years.

02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:04.540
Oh my God, it's 10 and a half years.

02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:06.260
I just realized that right now, oh my God.

02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:07.260
Happy anniversary.

02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:09.420
Thanks, man, awesome.

02:54:09.420 --> 02:54:12.460
So I've been out for 10 years and I would say

02:54:12.460 --> 02:54:15.860
the reason I didn't kill myself for the longest time

02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:18.020
was the individual I was dating.

02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:20.780
That was straight across the board, that was it.

02:54:22.140 --> 02:54:27.140
For me, there was no relief for about six years

02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:31.700
of the thought of just kill yourself, kill yourself,

02:54:31.700 --> 02:54:32.900
kill yourself, it's easier if you just do it.

02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:35.180
Like that voice was so strong for that long.

02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:36.660
There was really no relief.

02:54:36.660 --> 02:54:40.380
What there was though was implementation

02:54:40.380 --> 02:54:44.900
of different medications, realizing they weren't working,

02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:48.700
trying different things, getting myself to a point

02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:51.980
where I could leave my house comfortably-ish again

02:54:51.980 --> 02:54:54.660
and I wasn't triggered, which then allowed me to travel,

02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:58.340
which then allowed me to slowly try to go back to school,

02:54:58.340 --> 02:54:59.820
which by the way, it was a very bad idea.

02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:02.740
That was a bad idea, that was bad.

02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:06.020
I went too early, they started practicing

02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:08.140
active shooter drills in our school.

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:11.420
It was bad, my professors understood.

02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:14.060
School is full of triggers, it turns out.

02:55:14.060 --> 02:55:16.740
It is when you live in Vancouver.

02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:18.460
There's a theme to this conversation

02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:20.780
about your love for Canada.

02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:24.220
Look at me, I love my fucking country.

02:55:24.220 --> 02:55:26.820
I am one of the most patriotic people you will meet in it.

02:55:26.820 --> 02:55:29.140
I think Canada is one of the greatest

02:55:29.140 --> 02:55:30.540
fucking places on the earth.

02:55:31.540 --> 02:55:34.660
I think in the past two years or three years,

02:55:34.660 --> 02:55:37.660
I have seen what I loved so deeply,

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:40.260
so proudly preached about, so...

02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:52.740
I'm so proud of what I did there.

02:55:54.740 --> 02:55:57.820
And I'm so proud of the country I got to represent.

02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:02.380
Because I was good at my job.

02:56:03.460 --> 02:56:06.780
Being great at your job for a country you love,

02:56:06.780 --> 02:56:08.980
you just don't like some of the politicians

02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:09.820
some of the time.

02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:12.020
It's not even the politicians anymore.

02:56:12.020 --> 02:56:13.500
It's the state of the country.

02:56:14.620 --> 02:56:17.780
I'm a second class citizen in my own country right now.

02:56:17.780 --> 02:56:21.220
I can't travel to see my parents within my own country.

02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:23.660
I'm not allowed to step foot in my son's school.

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:28.220
I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.

02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:32.860
I'm not allowed to leave Canada without...

02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:35.700
I told you all the stuff I have to do to get here.

02:56:35.700 --> 02:56:38.300
To even get home, I have to do the same.

02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:40.700
I'm watched by the RCMP.

02:56:40.700 --> 02:56:41.540
I'm...

02:56:42.580 --> 02:56:44.540
Neighbors rat you out.

02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:47.300
So for somebody who fought for their country...

02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:49.100
I hate it. It makes me so sad.

02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:54.100
To go through this process of what many consider to be

02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:57.020
power overreach by government in the face of

02:56:57.020 --> 02:56:59.100
this particular pandemic.

02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:00.660
Yeah, yeah.

02:57:00.660 --> 02:57:03.500
I always knew I had a hard time with like, I loved Canada.

02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:06.740
The day I got spit on when I got home was not ideal, but...

02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:07.700
You got spit on.

02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:08.540
Yeah.

02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:15.740
But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I

02:57:15.740 --> 02:57:17.340
just put one foot in front of the other

02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:19.100
and kept going to treatment

02:57:19.100 --> 02:57:23.180
and kept doing what my doctor told me to do,

02:57:23.220 --> 02:57:27.020
that I could pull out of this if I tried.

02:57:27.020 --> 02:57:29.740
I was told that I could do anything in my life.

02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:31.380
It didn't matter.

02:57:31.380 --> 02:57:32.700
As long as I tried.

02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:34.260
Was trying really hard?

02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:36.860
Trying was...

02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:41.260
Trying was harder than breathing.

02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:42.900
It was exhausting.

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:43.820
It was...

02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:48.820
I would be awake for like half a day

02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:51.380
and every minute of that day, I'd just stare at the wall

02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:53.500
and just want to kill myself.

02:57:53.500 --> 02:57:55.220
Yeah, that's what I've...

02:57:55.220 --> 02:57:57.860
I had people close to me who suffered from depression

02:57:57.860 --> 02:58:01.700
and it was like, it's unclear how to escape,

02:58:01.700 --> 02:58:04.900
but it's clear that you need to try something

02:58:05.860 --> 02:58:08.060
and they didn't want to even try.

02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:09.660
Because you have no try in you.

02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:10.940
Yeah, you have no...

02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:14.060
I'm watching a person who has no energy essentially

02:58:14.060 --> 02:58:18.020
to like do any of it and it's like so hopeless,

02:58:18.020 --> 02:58:19.460
but you have to try.

02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:21.740
And I think some of that has to do

02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:24.140
with all the different physical feats you have to do.

02:58:24.140 --> 02:58:27.180
Like when you have nothing left, you still keep going.

02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:31.340
That same like weird drive when you're empty,

02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:32.500
you still keep going.

02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:34.540
I wanted to give up.

02:58:34.540 --> 02:58:37.660
I tried, I did.

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:40.420
I'm really lucky because it really was the one person

02:58:40.420 --> 02:58:43.900
that I'd wake up to next every day

02:58:43.900 --> 02:58:47.540
and he'd be like, hey, so that new drug you're on,

02:58:47.540 --> 02:58:49.140
fun fact, if you don't go to sleep right away,

02:58:49.140 --> 02:58:52.620
you talk and when you talk, you just don't fucking stop.

02:58:52.620 --> 02:58:55.940
And you go off about everything that's horrible.

02:58:55.940 --> 02:58:57.540
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

02:58:57.540 --> 02:58:59.460
No, last night, yeah, you took that pill, guess what?

02:58:59.460 --> 02:59:01.220
You just, you didn't stop.

02:59:01.220 --> 02:59:02.740
I have no recollection.

02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:04.500
I'd get up in the middle of the night,

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:08.220
I would cook food like on a stove

02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:10.940
and it would be, hopefully we don't die

02:59:10.940 --> 02:59:14.660
because I would have no recollection because of the drugs.

02:59:14.660 --> 02:59:17.260
The idea that when people say,

02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:19.340
well, just put yourself out of depression.

02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:22.420
I'm a highly motivated individual.

02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:30.740
The idea of lifting my head up to turn over was daunting.

02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:33.500
It's terrifying.

02:59:33.500 --> 02:59:36.140
So like for somebody as driven as you

02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:40.140
to completely lose all of that for moments of time,

02:59:40.140 --> 02:59:44.900
for stretches of time, fuck, the mind is a motherfucker.

02:59:44.980 --> 02:59:45.820
This is a-

02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:46.660
It is.

02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:51.380
I can't, for somebody like, I can't,

02:59:51.380 --> 02:59:54.340
I can't, I'm so grateful for people like you

02:59:54.340 --> 02:59:55.660
to be able to pull out of that.

02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:58.260
I've been always the opposite.

03:00:00.340 --> 03:00:05.180
I've been very fortunate to just always find joy

03:00:05.180 --> 03:00:07.700
in meaning in everything, even the stupidest shit.

03:00:07.700 --> 03:00:08.540
Can I ask you something?

03:00:08.540 --> 03:00:09.460
Yeah.

03:00:09.460 --> 03:00:12.660
Do you think that's because of how you were raised,

03:00:12.660 --> 03:00:13.860
where you came from?

03:00:15.780 --> 03:00:16.980
I had nothing to do with that.

03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:19.340
No, it was my own person.

03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:24.340
I honestly think it's the biology, the this,

03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:27.460
because I had, my parents, I'm very cognizant,

03:00:27.460 --> 03:00:30.380
I've had nothing to do with that.

03:00:30.380 --> 03:00:33.900
They never understood this little engine I had.

03:00:33.900 --> 03:00:36.420
I always liked just sitting, looking at people

03:00:36.420 --> 03:00:37.940
and just enjoying how amazing they are

03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:42.260
and just looking at, I think it's straight up just biology,

03:00:42.260 --> 03:00:44.500
whatever the neurochemistry is.

03:00:45.140 --> 03:00:47.100
I'm just getting a good drug.

03:00:47.100 --> 03:00:47.940
You're just getting hits.

03:00:47.940 --> 03:00:51.060
Yeah, I'm getting hits all the time from stupid shit.

03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:51.900
I love that.

03:00:51.900 --> 03:00:56.300
And it doesn't, and yeah, so that's why I can be,

03:00:56.300 --> 03:00:59.740
sometimes I'll talk very self-critically about myself,

03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:02.900
because that's almost makes me, it makes life more fun,

03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:05.060
it challenges stuff, it makes you more productive,

03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:08.980
but ultimately it's because I'm getting that good stuff

03:01:08.980 --> 03:01:09.820
all the time.

03:01:09.820 --> 03:01:12.140
I wondered about that, I was thinking about that

03:01:12.140 --> 03:01:14.020
when I listened to you for the first time on,

03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:15.780
I think when you're on Rogan for the first time,

03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:17.100
water shouldn't do that.

03:01:18.180 --> 03:01:20.020
Oh, it's not water, you shouldn't trust.

03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:20.860
See, this is a thing with the Russians.

03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:22.940
It's dissonant, it's done by Coca-Cola.

03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:26.180
Well, no, I had it resealed.

03:01:26.180 --> 03:01:28.300
I mean, I didn't go that far,

03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:30.900
but now I'm really starting to question what's in this,

03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:31.820
but that's okay.

03:01:31.820 --> 03:01:34.860
If I offered you tea, you should really be worried, but yeah.

03:01:34.860 --> 03:01:36.380
Why?

03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:40.300
I mean, that's the, no, that's the more famous way

03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:42.100
that Russians usually assassinate,

03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:44.140
they put poison in the tea,

03:01:44.140 --> 03:01:47.060
because a lot of Russians drink tea and, you know.

03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:50.860
All right, well, I mean, there is a blade right there, so.

03:01:50.860 --> 03:01:54.460
Like that was somebody, Andrew Huberman gave that to me.

03:01:54.460 --> 03:01:56.420
He's also a good, I don't know if you know him,

03:01:56.420 --> 03:01:57.260
but he's a cool.

03:01:57.260 --> 03:01:59.100
I don't know all the people you know, I'm new.

03:01:59.100 --> 03:01:59.940
Okay.

03:01:59.940 --> 03:02:00.780
I'm new here, Lex.

03:02:00.780 --> 03:02:01.600
You're gonna have to.

03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:02.440
I'll send instructions.

03:02:02.440 --> 03:02:03.280
Yeah, you're gonna have to send,

03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:04.420
what does my friend say?

03:02:04.420 --> 03:02:06.060
He says that he's an ex-operator

03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:07.380
and he'll message me once in a while

03:02:07.380 --> 03:02:08.780
and ask me something and I'll answer back.

03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:11.620
If I answer in the correct way,

03:02:11.620 --> 03:02:15.060
he'll go, candidate meets expectations.

03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:16.780
Fuck you, I'm not a candidate of anything.

03:02:16.780 --> 03:02:17.620
Yeah. Yeah.

03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:19.100
But yeah, it's essentially it.

03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:21.840
Well, Andrew Huberman is kind of a celebrity.

03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:23.900
Andrew, you should check her out.

03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:25.140
You're an interesting person.

03:02:25.140 --> 03:02:25.980
You guys should connect.

03:02:25.980 --> 03:02:28.020
He's a Stanford neuroscientist,

03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:32.660
was I think the number one podcast in the world in health.

03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:33.660
He's a.

03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:34.500
Is he on the beard?

03:02:34.500 --> 03:02:36.980
Does he have like a beard thing going?

03:02:37.980 --> 03:02:40.780
Yeah, I'm knocking him down too.

03:02:40.780 --> 03:02:42.500
Like, does he have a beard?

03:02:42.500 --> 03:02:45.220
I don't look at people's visual appearance, man.

03:02:45.220 --> 03:02:46.060
You're bullshit.

03:02:46.060 --> 03:02:46.980
No, I don't.

03:02:46.980 --> 03:02:47.800
Does he have a beard?

03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:48.640
I think he has a beard, yeah.

03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:50.140
I think I know who you're talking about.

03:02:50.140 --> 03:02:53.100
He's a very handsome gentleman.

03:02:54.020 --> 03:02:55.020
I think I know who you're talking about

03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:56.580
because I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.

03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:57.420
Yeah, exactly.

03:02:57.420 --> 03:02:58.580
No, seriously, on Instagram.

03:02:58.580 --> 03:02:59.420
No, no, no, okay.

03:02:59.420 --> 03:03:00.240
You probably know him.

03:03:00.240 --> 03:03:02.380
Yeah, that's, I mean, I don't know him.

03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:04.220
But he's very humble, very intelligent.

03:03:04.220 --> 03:03:05.060
Yeah.

03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:08.980
Would understand, like, I'm very kind of poetic and so on.

03:03:08.980 --> 03:03:12.900
He's probably the most rigorous

03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:16.620
reference machine of science.

03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:18.060
Like, he's a legit scientist.

03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:19.700
Like, he knows every paper

03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:21.260
and everything has to do with the mind.

03:03:21.260 --> 03:03:22.100
In neuroscience, like.

03:03:22.100 --> 03:03:23.260
Oh, he would be fascinating.

03:03:23.260 --> 03:03:24.300
Performance, yeah, yeah.

03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:28.500
He's much more, he's much more actually,

03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:32.220
and the focus is always on how to help,

03:03:32.220 --> 03:03:34.340
how that helps people.

03:03:34.380 --> 03:03:35.260
So, like, protocols.

03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:38.620
Like, here's what you need to do to get better sleep.

03:03:38.620 --> 03:03:39.460
Yes, yes, I know who it is.

03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:41.580
And he's like, here's like 1,000 papers.

03:03:41.580 --> 03:03:42.420
Yeah.

03:03:42.420 --> 03:03:44.300
And he just goes, like, hammers nonstop.

03:03:44.300 --> 03:03:48.780
I mean, jeez, he spent a week in Austin.

03:03:48.780 --> 03:03:52.420
He's going back and spending a couple weeks in Austin.

03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:54.460
We just hang out, and it's like,

03:03:54.460 --> 03:03:56.860
you think that was like a teleprompter or something.

03:03:56.860 --> 03:03:58.740
Like, the way he does his podcast.

03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:00.740
Yeah, but like, in person, he's the same.

03:04:00.740 --> 03:04:04.260
I'm like, all right, this is intense,

03:04:05.140 --> 03:04:05.980
but I like it.

03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:06.820
I like that.

03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:08.860
Anyway, why did we bring him up?

03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:09.700
I don't know.

03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:11.180
Brought up knives, we were talking about.

03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:12.380
He gave it to me, that's right.

03:04:12.380 --> 03:04:13.220
PTSD.

03:04:13.220 --> 03:04:14.860
Yeah, and then you talk about poison

03:04:14.860 --> 03:04:17.100
and how you were poisoning me, and I said knives.

03:04:17.100 --> 03:04:18.420
We were talking about Russians,

03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:21.260
and then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.

03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:22.300
Yeah.

03:04:22.300 --> 03:04:24.740
I think for most people, though,

03:04:24.740 --> 03:04:27.420
the biggest thing when they see somebody

03:04:27.420 --> 03:04:28.660
who's struggling with PTSD,

03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:32.460
their first reaction is, how do I help them?

03:04:32.460 --> 03:04:35.140
Well, often just saying, hey,

03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:36.380
I'm here when you're ready to talk

03:04:36.380 --> 03:04:37.300
and you're going through something,

03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:39.620
whether you wanna talk about it right now or not, I'm here.

03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:42.540
And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.

03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:45.140
When you start to see somebody having, you know,

03:04:45.140 --> 03:04:47.780
four, five, six beers at night.

03:04:49.180 --> 03:04:50.260
Let's ask why.

03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:52.500
When you see somebody, you can tell they're not sleeping.

03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:53.340
Hey buddy, you sleeping?

03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:54.700
Nah, I just am not sleeping.

03:04:55.660 --> 03:04:57.660
Instead of just going, oh, that sucks.

03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:00.340
Hey, why aren't you sleeping?

03:05:00.340 --> 03:05:01.340
You having nightmares?

03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:03.860
Are you, you just have an insomnia?

03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:05.220
Are you just eating sugar before bed?

03:05:05.220 --> 03:05:07.940
Like care enough about your people

03:05:07.940 --> 03:05:10.660
to just ask one follow-up question.

03:05:10.660 --> 03:05:12.740
Cause often that's really all it takes.

03:05:12.740 --> 03:05:15.100
Cause then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask.

03:05:15.100 --> 03:05:16.100
And then they'll just.

03:05:17.260 --> 03:05:19.820
Yeah, just showing that you care.

03:05:19.820 --> 03:05:22.620
Honestly, grocery store lineup.

03:05:22.620 --> 03:05:24.860
I'll say, oh, I like your dress.

03:05:24.860 --> 03:05:25.700
Oh, thank you.

03:05:25.700 --> 03:05:26.900
And then I'll go, how's your day going?

03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:30.300
They'll be like, actually, it's going all right.

03:05:30.300 --> 03:05:32.100
It's not as great as I thought it would be today,

03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:33.020
but I'm doing okay.

03:05:33.020 --> 03:05:35.140
But like they'll give you, instead of good you,

03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:37.260
instead of just giving you this fake false reaction,

03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:41.380
if you just show any effort in somebody

03:05:41.380 --> 03:05:43.980
that you care at all about someone's wellbeing,

03:05:43.980 --> 03:05:47.780
you'd be amazed, amazed.

03:05:47.780 --> 03:05:49.060
Yeah, some of that is just energy.

03:05:49.060 --> 03:05:51.100
The reason, honestly, I moved to Austin

03:05:51.100 --> 03:05:53.740
is some lady at a Walmart said,

03:05:53.740 --> 03:05:56.460
honey, you look handsome in that suit.

03:05:56.460 --> 03:05:58.820
But like, but the care that she put in that,

03:05:58.820 --> 03:06:00.100
she just looked at me.

03:06:00.940 --> 03:06:02.380
It wasn't like hitting at me or something.

03:06:02.380 --> 03:06:03.660
She was like, the love's like.

03:06:03.660 --> 03:06:04.500
Just love.

03:06:04.500 --> 03:06:07.380
Yeah, it was like, oh, okay, I'm moving here, I guess.

03:06:07.380 --> 03:06:09.300
There was a, that's so funny you said that

03:06:09.300 --> 03:06:11.260
because I told my husband this happened

03:06:11.260 --> 03:06:13.660
and it threw me off.

03:06:13.660 --> 03:06:15.980
There was an older lady at a store

03:06:15.980 --> 03:06:18.780
and this was right after we got a brief period

03:06:18.780 --> 03:06:21.740
of no masks in Canada, just like a brief.

03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:22.580
It's like five minutes.

03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:23.860
Oh yeah, it was not even that.

03:06:23.860 --> 03:06:26.700
And I had come from like an interview or something.

03:06:26.700 --> 03:06:28.580
So I had actually had makeup on that day

03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:31.020
and I had my hat and I was just at the grocery store.

03:06:31.020 --> 03:06:32.900
She walked up to me and she got real close

03:06:32.900 --> 03:06:34.140
and I didn't know what was happening.

03:06:34.140 --> 03:06:36.660
And she got closer and then she just grabbed my arm

03:06:36.660 --> 03:06:37.780
like this.

03:06:37.780 --> 03:06:40.460
She goes, I love that hat on you.

03:06:40.460 --> 03:06:42.220
And I looked at her and I was like,

03:06:42.220 --> 03:06:44.020
she touched me during a pandemic and she's all,

03:06:44.020 --> 03:06:45.700
oh my God, I love you too, thank you so much.

03:06:45.700 --> 03:06:47.100
I said, you're so amazing.

03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:49.060
I just, and I just sparked a conversation.

03:06:49.060 --> 03:06:50.780
Yeah, yeah, that's amazing.

03:06:50.780 --> 03:06:51.740
Doesn't take much.

03:06:51.740 --> 03:06:54.940
Yeah, at that little moment of genuine care.

03:06:55.140 --> 03:06:58.420
Maybe you can tell me actually the journey

03:06:58.420 --> 03:06:59.700
you took with Ayahuasca.

03:06:59.700 --> 03:07:00.540
Sure.

03:07:01.500 --> 03:07:02.940
That's such a fascinating journey.

03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:06.460
So like letting your mind go to different places

03:07:06.460 --> 03:07:07.940
in order to rediscover itself.

03:07:07.940 --> 03:07:09.980
Like, what is it?

03:07:09.980 --> 03:07:11.660
Like a rocket ship to somewhere else

03:07:11.660 --> 03:07:13.940
so you can land in a better place.

03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:15.700
Here, how about I show you something?

03:07:15.700 --> 03:07:16.780
That'll help your brain, okay?

03:07:16.780 --> 03:07:18.100
Yes.

03:07:18.100 --> 03:07:20.500
This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera

03:07:20.500 --> 03:07:21.580
because there's leaves in it.

03:07:21.580 --> 03:07:23.260
Like there's leaves in some pages.

03:07:23.260 --> 03:07:24.660
So just don't dump it out

03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:25.780
because it'll go all fucking everywhere.

03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:26.940
Got it, got it.

03:07:26.940 --> 03:07:28.300
Instructions, I like this.

03:07:28.300 --> 03:07:30.340
Yeah, well, you feel like you need them.

03:07:32.740 --> 03:07:36.780
Ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic

03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:39.540
that we have been so blessed to have on this earth

03:07:39.540 --> 03:07:43.540
that we have so underutilized and could be,

03:07:43.540 --> 03:07:45.740
I don't wanna say saving humanity, but just,

03:07:45.740 --> 03:07:46.580
you ever hear that saying,

03:07:46.580 --> 03:07:48.460
if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time,

03:07:48.460 --> 03:07:50.100
the world would be a better place?

03:07:50.100 --> 03:07:50.940
Okay.

03:07:50.940 --> 03:07:55.940
So psilocybin is, I use for microdosing for depression.

03:07:57.620 --> 03:08:00.180
I did ayahuasca in January of this year.

03:08:01.460 --> 03:08:03.380
And I've, at that point,

03:08:03.380 --> 03:08:06.420
that was the last time I was on a pharmaceutical drug.

03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:09.860
I've been off everything ever since, 10 different ones.

03:08:09.860 --> 03:08:12.180
So if you backtrack a little bit, just to,

03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:15.220
so you'll understand, my doctor gave me the opportunity,

03:08:15.220 --> 03:08:19.140
Dr. Greg Passy, he is a veteran himself,

03:08:19.140 --> 03:08:21.460
served in Bosnia and Rwanda, he's a medic.

03:08:21.460 --> 03:08:23.340
He's a Colonel, I think Colonel Lieutenant,

03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:24.900
he's gonna fucking punch me right in the face for that.

03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:26.420
He's high up officer.

03:08:28.020 --> 03:08:29.220
He is one of my saviors.

03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:31.140
He's like my old, I call him my old man.

03:08:31.140 --> 03:08:32.060
He's my favorite.

03:08:32.060 --> 03:08:34.900
And rides a Harley, like that kind of guy.

03:08:34.900 --> 03:08:35.740
Nice.

03:08:35.740 --> 03:08:38.860
Yeah, and he said, you know, Kelce, this is,

03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:41.340
I just don't, I was hitting a wall.

03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:42.940
I wasn't getting any better.

03:08:42.940 --> 03:08:45.660
And he goes, how do you feel about cannabis?

03:08:45.660 --> 03:08:48.140
And I was like, I don't feel good about it

03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:51.780
because family histories or my parents always told me

03:08:51.780 --> 03:08:55.140
if I smoked weed, you know, it's just this perception.

03:08:55.140 --> 03:08:56.540
Because I just wanted to try it.

03:08:56.540 --> 03:08:58.860
Just would you be willing to try it?

03:08:58.860 --> 03:09:01.500
So I was like, okay, so I was willing to try it.

03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:03.580
Then I started going to these groups called Women Grow

03:09:03.580 --> 03:09:06.300
and learning about it.

03:09:06.300 --> 03:09:11.300
And then I realized, oh, I'm starting to sleep a little bit.

03:09:12.660 --> 03:09:14.820
I don't feel groggy in the morning.

03:09:14.820 --> 03:09:16.580
I don't feel like a bag of shit.

03:09:16.580 --> 03:09:18.020
And I also wanna have a baby one day.

03:09:18.860 --> 03:09:20.980
And I can't have all this stuff in my system.

03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:22.940
So I started using cannabis

03:09:22.940 --> 03:09:26.820
and then I started using it as a main medication.

03:09:26.820 --> 03:09:31.820
And I'd been using it now since 2014, got married,

03:09:31.820 --> 03:09:36.820
15, 16, Jack was born in 16, 15, 2015, I started using it.

03:09:38.940 --> 03:09:40.660
And then I've been using it ever since.

03:09:40.660 --> 03:09:43.460
And that was the way I got off

03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:45.500
of all the pharmaceutical drugs,

03:09:45.500 --> 03:09:47.820
was keeping cannabis the constant,

03:09:48.620 --> 03:09:49.460
finding the right strains for me.

03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:51.860
And then slowly with the doctor's advice

03:09:51.860 --> 03:09:56.260
and under supervision, going off of those medications.

03:09:56.260 --> 03:09:59.580
Cut to January of 2021,

03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:02.380
I had hit a really bad spell last year.

03:10:02.380 --> 03:10:05.180
And the year before was a really big struggle.

03:10:05.180 --> 03:10:07.820
I almost lost my company last year due to COVID,

03:10:07.820 --> 03:10:10.220
just like many, many millions of people did.

03:10:11.740 --> 03:10:15.060
And instead of me just laying down and taking it,

03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:18.380
I pivoted really quickly and called the factory

03:10:18.380 --> 03:10:19.940
and said, do you guys make masks?

03:10:19.940 --> 03:10:21.180
They're like, yeah, we're making masks.

03:10:21.180 --> 03:10:24.060
I was like, I'm gonna call the Canadian government.

03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:25.740
I'm gonna get my medical license

03:10:25.740 --> 03:10:27.420
and I'm gonna try to sell the masks

03:10:27.420 --> 03:10:28.260
and see if we can do that.

03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:29.100
And so we did that.

03:10:29.100 --> 03:10:33.660
And so we did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals,

03:10:34.500 --> 03:10:37.980
which ironically went to my entire community

03:10:37.980 --> 03:10:39.820
I was born and raised in.

03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:41.700
So it was really weird.

03:10:41.700 --> 03:10:43.500
And that kept us afloat long enough.

03:10:44.500 --> 03:10:46.580
We lost 200 retail locations

03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:48.900
that I all single-handedly spent five years

03:10:48.900 --> 03:10:50.820
going like door-to-door getting myself.

03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:54.860
And we should say this is Brass and Unity, jewelry.

03:10:54.860 --> 03:10:56.780
The jewelry and sunglass company.

03:10:56.780 --> 03:10:58.140
And I started-

03:10:58.140 --> 03:10:59.620
Speaking of which,

03:10:59.620 --> 03:11:04.020
they put on the Brass and Unity sunglasses.

03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:04.980
You do look good in them.

03:11:04.980 --> 03:11:06.100
I won't lie to you. Thank you.

03:11:06.100 --> 03:11:07.700
Well, okay, we'll call them the Lex.

03:11:07.700 --> 03:11:08.700
Those are now called the Lex.

03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:10.300
Fuck the gunner, they're the Lex.

03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:11.540
I like it, the Lex.

03:11:11.540 --> 03:11:13.180
I'm jumping around here, but just bear with me.

03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:16.140
I started, my doctor suggested art therapy.

03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:17.100
Dr. Passy did.

03:11:17.100 --> 03:11:19.140
And that's really how the company started.

03:11:19.140 --> 03:11:21.500
I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill.

03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:23.140
And I fucked up our kitchen table.

03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:25.260
And I taught myself how to put jewelry.

03:11:25.260 --> 03:11:26.780
Because my husband was like, you can do it.

03:11:26.780 --> 03:11:27.620
Go for it.

03:11:27.620 --> 03:11:29.540
So I was like, okay, he says he believes in me.

03:11:29.540 --> 03:11:30.860
So I guess I can do it.

03:11:30.860 --> 03:11:32.820
No idea what I'm doing.

03:11:32.820 --> 03:11:35.780
And then got to this point,

03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:38.140
you know, when COVID hit and people lost companies

03:11:38.140 --> 03:11:40.620
and we pivoted and we did what we could.

03:11:40.620 --> 03:11:45.420
And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.

03:11:45.420 --> 03:11:49.020
I found purpose again with this company.

03:11:49.020 --> 03:11:51.260
I found a way to help again.

03:11:51.260 --> 03:11:53.700
I found myself again.

03:11:54.540 --> 03:11:56.900
And then that was in danger of being gone again.

03:11:58.460 --> 03:12:01.060
So the company is 2015?

03:12:01.060 --> 03:12:04.580
We started, I started building jewelry in 2015

03:12:04.580 --> 03:12:06.940
under like a, just it was called Her Wearables.

03:12:06.940 --> 03:12:07.900
And it was really small.

03:12:07.900 --> 03:12:11.420
And it was just, I was just trying to make stuff.

03:12:11.420 --> 03:12:13.100
It wasn't supposed to be a company.

03:12:13.100 --> 03:12:15.020
And you were on a ton of medication throughout

03:12:15.020 --> 03:12:15.860
this whole process.

03:12:15.860 --> 03:12:17.540
Just looped out of my tree.

03:12:17.540 --> 03:12:21.380
And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is,

03:12:21.380 --> 03:12:25.020
she was driving her Kevin Hart's What Now Tour.

03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:28.060
And so she got, she just harassed them.

03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:29.660
Was like, you need to meet my daughter.

03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:30.500
Yeah.

03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:32.460
I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart, that's cool.

03:12:32.460 --> 03:12:34.100
But he just gave me a good piece of advice.

03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:35.380
Hey, if you're going to make this something,

03:12:35.380 --> 03:12:37.220
you can't really, if you want it to be for everyone,

03:12:37.220 --> 03:12:38.460
you can't call it Her Wearables.

03:12:38.460 --> 03:12:39.780
I was like, cool.

03:12:39.780 --> 03:12:41.020
And then we drove home that night

03:12:41.020 --> 03:12:42.660
and then he tweeted it out to people.

03:12:42.660 --> 03:12:43.500
Wow.

03:12:43.500 --> 03:12:44.540
To 24 million people.

03:12:44.540 --> 03:12:47.700
This was before he was like, who is now?

03:12:47.700 --> 03:12:49.540
And that was a giant deal.

03:12:49.540 --> 03:12:51.100
And then my husband kind of looked at me and being,

03:12:51.100 --> 03:12:52.380
he's so fucking brilliant.

03:12:52.380 --> 03:12:53.620
He looked at me and goes, all right,

03:12:53.620 --> 03:12:54.940
yeah, we got to come up with a rename.

03:12:54.940 --> 03:12:56.860
Let me start thinking, let me start brainstorming.

03:12:56.860 --> 03:12:58.220
Like, let's make, you want to make this real?

03:12:58.220 --> 03:12:59.540
Let's make this real.

03:12:59.540 --> 03:13:00.900
And so we did.

03:13:00.900 --> 03:13:02.300
And he was like, what do you think about,

03:13:02.300 --> 03:13:04.300
like we were doing like Brass Collective Co,

03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:07.100
Brass this, but I just knew I wanted Brass in the name.

03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:08.940
And then he's like, what about Brass in Unity?

03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:09.780
You're trying to like unify people.

03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:10.620
Like, why wouldn't you do that?

03:13:10.620 --> 03:13:13.340
I'm like, fuck me, of course I came up with it

03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:14.180
like everything else.

03:13:14.180 --> 03:13:15.020
That's a great name.

03:13:15.020 --> 03:13:16.260
Well, he's a brilliant person.

03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:17.100
It's annoying.

03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:17.940
Yeah.

03:13:17.940 --> 03:13:20.620
So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built

03:13:20.620 --> 03:13:23.780
and just got me kind of functioning with was devastating.

03:13:24.660 --> 03:13:27.900
So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff,

03:13:27.900 --> 03:13:29.140
Combat Flip Flops.

03:13:30.540 --> 03:13:32.100
Again, Brady, my husband was like,

03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:34.580
hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.

03:13:34.580 --> 03:13:36.700
Hey, have you heard of this company, Combat Flip Flops?

03:13:36.700 --> 03:13:38.740
Remember we watched them on Shark Tank.

03:13:38.740 --> 03:13:40.940
And then I reached out, he emailed me back.

03:13:40.940 --> 03:13:42.420
He's like, yeah, we go together,

03:13:42.420 --> 03:13:43.780
like Peanut Butter and Jelly are companies.

03:13:43.780 --> 03:13:45.380
That sounds great.

03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:48.140
And then I was like, hey, also like,

03:13:48.140 --> 03:13:49.300
do you think one of your owners

03:13:49.300 --> 03:13:50.660
would want to come on the podcast?

03:13:50.660 --> 03:13:52.260
Just like tossing it out there,

03:13:52.260 --> 03:13:53.820
kind of like I did with you.

03:13:53.820 --> 03:13:56.380
And he was like, yeah, I'd love to come on.

03:13:56.380 --> 03:13:58.700
And I was like, oh my God, Brady.

03:13:58.700 --> 03:14:00.980
And he came on the podcast and it went great.

03:14:00.980 --> 03:14:02.980
And then at the end of it, we stopped recording

03:14:02.980 --> 03:14:04.140
and he just kind of did this thing.

03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:05.740
He does this.

03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:08.300
He just like leans in real close,

03:14:08.300 --> 03:14:10.980
just looks into your soul and goes, how you doing?

03:14:10.980 --> 03:14:12.020
And they're like, great.

03:14:12.020 --> 03:14:13.860
And he's like, how you really doing?

03:14:13.860 --> 03:14:17.100
And I'm like, I'm horrible, I hate everything.

03:14:17.100 --> 03:14:20.820
Ah, just this whole, just like waterworks happen.

03:14:20.820 --> 03:14:24.140
And he goes, listen, have you ever heard of Ayahuasca?

03:14:24.140 --> 03:14:25.860
And I was like, yeah, like in movies

03:14:25.860 --> 03:14:29.140
and like psychedelics in the seventies, you know?

03:14:29.140 --> 03:14:31.700
And he's like, no, no, no, no, let's like have a talk.

03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:34.060
And he goes, I've got an opportunity for a spot.

03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:37.100
I'm going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.

03:14:37.100 --> 03:14:41.620
They have spaces in UK, Canada and the United States.

03:14:41.620 --> 03:14:44.180
They're owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.

03:14:45.420 --> 03:14:47.740
You know, they're really trying to help vets

03:14:47.740 --> 03:14:50.020
and this has worked, would you wanna come?

03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:51.580
And before he even said like,

03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:54.300
before I even got like an invite, I was like, can I come?

03:14:54.300 --> 03:14:56.900
When can I, when do we, when do we go?

03:14:57.820 --> 03:14:59.900
And he's like, oh, it's in like three weeks.

03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:02.380
You can't be on any SSRIs.

03:15:02.380 --> 03:15:04.140
If you're on any, you're gonna have to wean off.

03:15:04.140 --> 03:15:06.580
And at the time I was on my last one.

03:15:06.580 --> 03:15:08.580
And so I was like, I called my doctor

03:15:08.580 --> 03:15:10.260
and I was like, listen.

03:15:10.260 --> 03:15:11.660
And he was like, what?

03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:13.620
And I was like, guess what I'm about to do?

03:15:13.620 --> 03:15:16.340
And he's like, I'm gonna go do Ayahuasca.

03:15:16.340 --> 03:15:18.860
And he goes, you're gonna, he does this thing

03:15:18.860 --> 03:15:23.340
where he just goes, all right.

03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:25.060
Cause he knows he's not gonna win.

03:15:25.060 --> 03:15:26.220
He knows I'll just fight him on it.

03:15:26.220 --> 03:15:29.020
Let's just call that like the, the Jaco reset.

03:15:29.020 --> 03:15:29.860
Yeah.

03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:30.780
Because he does a.

03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:31.620
Pretty much.

03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:33.020
Yeah, exactly.

03:15:33.020 --> 03:15:35.300
And he goes, I said, but here's the kicker.

03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:37.420
I have to go off of this medication.

03:15:37.420 --> 03:15:39.180
And he goes, well, you know, we're supposed to do that

03:15:39.180 --> 03:15:41.140
in the summer months when the depression's not green,

03:15:41.140 --> 03:15:41.980
you know, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:45.860
And I said, listen, I hear you, but I'm doing it.

03:15:45.860 --> 03:15:47.060
Whether you want me to or not.

03:15:47.060 --> 03:15:49.980
So I'm letting you know, hey, this is gonna happen.

03:15:49.980 --> 03:15:52.060
And he's like, okay, just try to do it properly.

03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:52.900
I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:15:52.900 --> 03:15:53.720
I know the drill.

03:15:53.720 --> 03:15:54.560
I know the drill, whatever, whatever.

03:15:54.560 --> 03:15:55.380
I went to school to be a paramedic.

03:15:55.380 --> 03:15:56.220
I know the drill.

03:15:56.220 --> 03:15:57.620
I'll go off of it properly.

03:15:57.620 --> 03:15:59.740
But again, like drop that within a week

03:16:00.620 --> 03:16:02.060
I was done taking it.

03:16:02.060 --> 03:16:04.980
And I was going through like the world's worst

03:16:04.980 --> 03:16:06.260
just withdrawals.

03:16:06.260 --> 03:16:09.180
It was like, you were at a rock concert

03:16:09.180 --> 03:16:10.720
and your head was banging up and down,

03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:13.100
but you were sitting perfectly still.

03:16:13.100 --> 03:16:15.020
It was horrible.

03:16:15.020 --> 03:16:17.260
But you had like a thing to look forward to

03:16:17.260 --> 03:16:18.100
with the sidewalk.

03:16:18.100 --> 03:16:19.860
I had a light at the end of the tunnel.

03:16:19.860 --> 03:16:22.440
And I knew if I got to the light

03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:23.660
was the worst that's gonna happen.

03:16:23.660 --> 03:16:25.020
Just get to the light.

03:16:25.020 --> 03:16:28.300
But at that point, like, again, I had a son.

03:16:28.300 --> 03:16:29.140
I had a husband.

03:16:29.140 --> 03:16:29.980
I have a great company.

03:16:29.980 --> 03:16:30.800
I have a great house.

03:16:30.800 --> 03:16:31.640
I have a nice car.

03:16:31.640 --> 03:16:32.480
I have everything.

03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:35.540
Why did I wanna die every minute of the day?

03:16:36.820 --> 03:16:38.740
I was at that point again.

03:16:38.740 --> 03:16:39.800
And I'm like, this has got it.

03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:41.260
Something's gotta give.

03:16:41.260 --> 03:16:44.500
And so I went and I got there.

03:16:44.500 --> 03:16:48.900
And she is

03:16:48.900 --> 03:16:53.900
the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity

03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:07.580
or visualization, whatever you wanna deem Ayahuasca as.

03:17:08.940 --> 03:17:10.400
Mama Ayahuasca is real.

03:17:11.460 --> 03:17:13.660
And she takes no prisoners.

03:17:14.880 --> 03:17:18.180
She shows you exactly what you need to see

03:17:18.220 --> 03:17:19.700
to help yourself.

03:17:19.700 --> 03:17:23.580
But she does not discriminate

03:17:23.580 --> 03:17:26.260
against whether you're ready or not.

03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:29.180
If you've ingested it, she's coming for you.

03:17:30.380 --> 03:17:32.580
She's gonna be either gentle

03:17:32.580 --> 03:17:34.360
or she's gonna beat your ass.

03:17:34.360 --> 03:17:35.900
And sometimes that's what you need.

03:17:35.900 --> 03:17:40.900
But she does it in a way that is profound.

03:17:43.100 --> 03:17:46.740
So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?

03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:49.900
What are the places it took you?

03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:52.100
These people that had you meet?

03:17:52.100 --> 03:17:56.580
For the first time, I got to be in a group of people

03:17:56.580 --> 03:17:59.320
who didn't judge me or question my service.

03:17:59.320 --> 03:18:01.300
They just respect me.

03:18:01.300 --> 03:18:02.940
That was number one.

03:18:02.940 --> 03:18:06.020
So that group I lost, I just found again.

03:18:09.060 --> 03:18:11.220
Big shocker, I was the only woman there again.

03:18:12.220 --> 03:18:14.920
Seems to be the thing for me.

03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:18.560
And so I was surrounded by all these special operators.

03:18:18.560 --> 03:18:19.880
These aren't normal soldiers.

03:18:19.880 --> 03:18:23.960
These guys that I'm with are like bronze star,

03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:28.960
fucking purple heart, just the coolest people.

03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:32.120
People I've always wanted to be like, that's my buddy.

03:18:32.120 --> 03:18:34.700
Now I can be like, those are my buddies.

03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:36.600
Those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.

03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:38.160
They will bend over backwards.

03:18:38.160 --> 03:18:40.020
They will exfil me out of anywhere.

03:18:40.020 --> 03:18:41.600
They will take a bullet for me.

03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:45.840
And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn't expect.

03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:48.200
So that hit me weird right off the get.

03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:50.560
I was nervous and now I was just felt that home

03:18:50.560 --> 03:18:52.060
for a minute.

03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:54.060
And then when I stepped into ceremony,

03:18:57.120 --> 03:18:59.720
the first night, cause you do three nights

03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:02.200
over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:06.640
The first night, I was so nervous and so anxious

03:19:06.640 --> 03:19:10.560
cause you go up in ceremony and the shamans come in

03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:12.120
and they cleanse themselves.

03:19:12.120 --> 03:19:16.360
And then you get served the ayah individually.

03:19:16.360 --> 03:19:17.920
You go up, they give it to you.

03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:19.160
You can take your time and pray.

03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:20.000
You can do whatever you want.

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:21.480
Then you drink it.

03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:26.480
I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there

03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:30.000
and I was like trying to keep it in,

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:33.100
but I could feel that like heat come from my toes

03:19:33.100 --> 03:19:33.940
all the way up.

03:19:33.940 --> 03:19:35.040
And you're like, your mouth starts to water.

03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:37.120
I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up.

03:19:37.120 --> 03:19:39.080
And I looked over to Griff and I looked at Bishop

03:19:39.080 --> 03:19:42.840
and I swallow it.

03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:45.200
And I was like, okay.

03:19:45.200 --> 03:19:47.560
And you can't talk or anything.

03:19:47.560 --> 03:19:51.280
So I like, my buddy, we call him the Viking,

03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:52.200
a soul Viking.

03:19:52.200 --> 03:19:53.640
He looks like a Viking.

03:19:53.640 --> 03:19:54.720
His head's tattooed.

03:19:54.720 --> 03:19:57.280
He's been on the show.

03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:58.720
He's so cool.

03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:00.640
He's sitting directly across like you and I

03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:01.780
and he can see him and he's looking at me

03:20:01.780 --> 03:20:06.780
and I'm throwing up and I do it about three times.

03:20:07.160 --> 03:20:08.760
And then the last time he just saw me

03:20:09.240 --> 03:20:11.960
and I couldn't do it, I threw it up.

03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:16.280
And so I like to think that was her way of easing me in.

03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:18.820
So I didn't get like a full punch to the face,

03:20:18.820 --> 03:20:20.840
but I gotta, let me take your hand

03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:22.440
and show you what I'm gonna show you.

03:20:22.440 --> 03:20:23.440
We're gonna make you better.

03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:25.000
We're gonna take the pain away.

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:26.960
Aren't you supposed to eventually throw up

03:20:26.960 --> 03:20:27.800
no matter what?

03:20:27.800 --> 03:20:28.680
It's not supposed to.

03:20:28.680 --> 03:20:29.560
Some people don't.

03:20:29.560 --> 03:20:30.640
You purge, yeah.

03:20:30.640 --> 03:20:32.680
If something's happening, you're going through something.

03:20:32.680 --> 03:20:34.840
Yeah, you purge, but it doesn't have to happen.

03:20:34.840 --> 03:20:37.920
But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no.

03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:40.920
This takes like, you gotta sit and meditate for,

03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:43.600
or sit still basically and meditate in the pitch black

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:46.280
for about 45 minutes before the effects even,

03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:48.160
before you even feel her.

03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:50.040
So it's very.

03:20:50.040 --> 03:20:52.960
So here she figured out the right dose you need, maybe.

03:20:52.960 --> 03:20:55.640
Well, because I did the same dose as everyone else.

03:20:55.640 --> 03:20:58.200
I think it was 20 mils, which doesn't seem like a lot.

03:20:59.360 --> 03:21:03.760
But when you've never done hiatus, oh my God.

03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:07.360
So I felt like such a bitch.

03:21:07.360 --> 03:21:09.280
Oh my God, I felt like such a bitch.

03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:11.560
Okay, that was the thought going through your mind.

03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:13.160
Oh, you just fucked it all up.

03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:14.000
You ruined it.

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:14.960
You ruined this again.

03:21:14.960 --> 03:21:16.320
You couldn't do this, right?

03:21:16.320 --> 03:21:17.160
Yeah.

03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:22.160
And so at that point, we went through the meditation part

03:21:22.840 --> 03:21:25.200
and the shamans were, they literally sing

03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:26.720
for like six hours straight.

03:21:26.720 --> 03:21:28.680
So you said that you take it and then there's just.

03:21:28.680 --> 03:21:29.520
You just wait.

03:21:29.520 --> 03:21:30.920
What, you're quietly listening to them.

03:21:30.920 --> 03:21:33.920
Meditate and you wait and you wait.

03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:34.960
And you're in pitch black,

03:21:34.960 --> 03:21:37.120
like can't see this far in front of your face.

03:21:37.960 --> 03:21:39.360
And you have a little puke bucket

03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:42.120
and then you have a little light that has a red filter on it.

03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:43.400
If you have to get up to go to the bathroom

03:21:43.400 --> 03:21:44.800
to get out of the yurt, you use that

03:21:44.800 --> 03:21:47.040
so you don't turn lights on.

03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:50.120
And me, I brought like what?

03:21:50.120 --> 03:21:53.200
No, it's just a cool visual of just a puke bucket

03:21:53.200 --> 03:21:54.680
and a little light for the.

03:21:54.680 --> 03:21:56.720
Like I can imagine these like little lights

03:21:56.720 --> 03:21:57.720
going on every once in a while.

03:21:57.720 --> 03:21:59.440
And then the rest is just in darkness,

03:21:59.440 --> 03:22:03.040
meditating with this singing.

03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:04.840
It's so beautiful.

03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:06.360
I'll take you some time.

03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:09.880
Cause trust me, I wouldn't offer

03:22:09.880 --> 03:22:12.040
if it wasn't the group I would trust.

03:22:12.040 --> 03:22:14.440
Yeah, you had a very interesting group.

03:22:14.440 --> 03:22:16.600
So it's the Heroic Hearts people.

03:22:16.600 --> 03:22:17.440
Yeah, Heroic Hearts.

03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:18.920
So yeah, this is my.

03:22:18.920 --> 03:22:20.480
Jesse gave us all these journals.

03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:22.320
They're like, you're gonna want these.

03:22:22.320 --> 03:22:23.640
So he gave us all these journals.

03:22:23.640 --> 03:22:25.160
And now this is like my Bible.

03:22:25.160 --> 03:22:28.720
Like my work, my everything goes in this with me everywhere.

03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:31.280
It's just this like silent reminder for me.

03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:35.000
And so Heroic Hearts does fantastic work.

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.080
I'll get into them after.

03:22:37.080 --> 03:22:42.080
The thing with this group is there's such care.

03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:46.560
It's not like go do AYA and like you're done.

03:22:46.560 --> 03:22:49.200
There's like integration coaches and there's like doctors.

03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:50.640
And there's like people to make sure

03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:52.680
that you're doing the work.

03:22:52.680 --> 03:22:55.280
Because AYA is just the gate.

03:22:55.280 --> 03:22:56.800
Now you have to take it

03:22:56.800 --> 03:22:59.640
and you have to implement it into your life.

03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:00.800
People don't do that though.

03:23:00.800 --> 03:23:02.720
Did you do like integration?

03:23:02.720 --> 03:23:04.400
Did you do conversations with somebody?

03:23:04.400 --> 03:23:07.480
Did you talk to like, is there a process to?

03:23:07.480 --> 03:23:10.360
Because I've, similar with psilocybin you mentioned,

03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:14.160
as I understand it's exceptionally beneficial

03:23:14.160 --> 03:23:16.640
for when you also do like talk therapy.

03:23:16.640 --> 03:23:19.880
Like you couple that with the integration in some form

03:23:19.880 --> 03:23:21.800
where you talk through your experience

03:23:21.800 --> 03:23:23.240
and you talk through different things.

03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:25.120
Like that seems to be a really.

03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:26.480
You know, I need to do that more

03:23:26.480 --> 03:23:28.760
with basically every substance I take.

03:23:28.760 --> 03:23:31.720
Like if I get what you have been every once in a while

03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:35.240
known to do a bit of vodka or whiskey or whatever,

03:23:35.240 --> 03:23:37.640
like do integration the next day.

03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:38.520
Well, what did you learn?

03:23:38.520 --> 03:23:39.360
What did you get from that?

03:23:39.360 --> 03:23:40.200
What did you get?

03:23:40.200 --> 03:23:41.040
Because you learn a lot,

03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:42.680
but you sometimes kind of just move on

03:23:42.680 --> 03:23:44.160
and you celebrate that that happened.

03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:46.160
But like really kind of think through it.

03:23:46.160 --> 03:23:47.520
Write it down.

03:23:47.520 --> 03:23:50.000
It's important because that's what this was.

03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:52.880
So the first night, I'll give like a very,

03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:55.320
because trust me, we could spend a whole podcast

03:23:55.320 --> 03:23:57.040
on both of the, all three of those nights.

03:23:57.040 --> 03:23:59.600
But the first night, the biggest thing that happened for me

03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:01.640
is I got to see my daughter.

03:24:02.600 --> 03:24:04.720
Which was my first baby.

03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:07.960
And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.

03:24:07.960 --> 03:24:09.240
Fuck you.

03:24:09.240 --> 03:24:10.080
That was my daughter.

03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:11.280
And I'm very aware it was.

03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:12.520
I'm very conscious that it was.

03:24:13.480 --> 03:24:17.320
And at that point, she just eased me in enough

03:24:17.320 --> 03:24:21.480
to let me know and showed me enough that this wasn't it.

03:24:21.480 --> 03:24:24.520
This wasn't the end all be all.

03:24:24.520 --> 03:24:26.760
Where you are right now on this plane,

03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:30.520
on this dimension in this life, this is a blip.

03:24:31.280 --> 03:24:34.600
It is so minuscule to the big picture.

03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:36.240
And so she really did that by,

03:24:36.240 --> 03:24:40.200
she showed me just a black and then like a crack.

03:24:40.200 --> 03:24:42.680
And then these vibrant colors that I can't describe

03:24:42.680 --> 03:24:44.120
because there aren't words.

03:24:44.120 --> 03:24:47.880
Alex Gray does really great art.

03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:49.400
And that is like been the closest thing

03:24:49.400 --> 03:24:51.400
I've been able to find colors.

03:24:51.400 --> 03:24:54.680
He's a famous guy who does ayahuasca.

03:24:54.680 --> 03:24:56.760
And he's an artist.

03:24:56.760 --> 03:24:59.000
I think he's got stuff in New York as well.

03:24:59.040 --> 03:25:04.040
But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief

03:25:05.960 --> 03:25:08.720
and showed me enough that I could go,

03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:10.000
I could wake up the next day

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:11.600
and not wanna die the next day.

03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:14.440
And so what Herro Kartz said,

03:25:14.440 --> 03:25:15.800
because it gave us all these journals,

03:25:15.800 --> 03:25:19.480
they're like, the next day you kind of wake up

03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:24.240
and you do a meeting, you do like a circle.

03:25:24.240 --> 03:25:25.520
All of us sit in the room

03:25:25.520 --> 03:25:27.840
and talk about what just happened the night before.

03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:29.640
People are crying and people are quiet

03:25:29.640 --> 03:25:32.320
and you just listen and that's what you do.

03:25:32.320 --> 03:25:35.040
And then you write on your free time.

03:25:35.040 --> 03:25:37.560
So after that, it's like up to you what you wanna do.

03:25:37.560 --> 03:25:39.040
Do you wanna just go walk in the woods?

03:25:39.040 --> 03:25:41.320
Well, I chose to go find a fence post

03:25:41.320 --> 03:25:43.480
and lie on it for an hour.

03:25:43.480 --> 03:25:44.320
I'm not kidding.

03:25:44.320 --> 03:25:45.800
I lied there and stared up at these two eagles

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.880
that were just in like the,

03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:49.640
I'll tell you where we were after and you'll be like,

03:25:49.640 --> 03:25:50.880
oh, okay, I get it.

03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:53.160
And then I found a forest

03:25:53.160 --> 03:25:55.000
and I just walked up with my book

03:25:55.000 --> 03:26:00.000
and I just lied there for hours.

03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:03.880
And then she all of a sudden started giving me

03:26:03.880 --> 03:26:05.800
what you call your downloads.

03:26:05.800 --> 03:26:07.560
So the stuff you learn,

03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:09.240
the stuff that you were all of a sudden you're remembering

03:26:09.240 --> 03:26:10.960
and these messages that come through

03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:13.160
and that's what this is.

03:26:13.160 --> 03:26:15.560
What kind of things are we talking about?

03:26:17.520 --> 03:26:19.960
So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me

03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:22.080
at the beginning of that first night

03:26:22.080 --> 03:26:23.320
was that I don't breathe.

03:26:24.320 --> 03:26:29.320
I just, I don't, I don't breathe.

03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:32.880
I don't fucking breathe at all.

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:34.520
I just, one thing to the next thing,

03:26:34.520 --> 03:26:36.240
the next thing, the next thing, just to survive.

03:26:36.240 --> 03:26:39.040
I don't take a minute and breathe.

03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:41.680
And so she made, when I say she and I say it

03:26:41.680 --> 03:26:43.160
because it's hard for people to understand,

03:26:43.160 --> 03:26:44.440
but I showed this to my husband.

03:26:44.440 --> 03:26:46.720
I showed it to my doctors and they're like,

03:26:46.720 --> 03:26:48.560
bitch, that's not you, you don't write like that.

03:26:48.560 --> 03:26:50.000
You don't talk like that.

03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:51.800
So like you can flip through it,

03:26:51.800 --> 03:26:56.760
but it was like, I'll just give,

03:26:56.760 --> 03:26:58.560
I'll just let Lex read for a second and just,

03:26:58.560 --> 03:26:59.680
I'll just do, here, let me do,

03:26:59.680 --> 03:27:02.200
I'll do an ad for Heroic Hearts, Heroic Hearts.

03:27:02.200 --> 03:27:04.480
Here, I'll get my papers while you read.

03:27:04.480 --> 03:27:07.200
Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.

03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:08.400
Do you mind if I read some of these things?

03:27:08.400 --> 03:27:11.040
You can read some of it, yeah, go right ahead.

03:27:11.040 --> 03:27:13.280
The dark has lifted.

03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:15.520
Judge my spelling and I'll punch you with it.

03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:18.320
Well, there's like.

03:27:18.320 --> 03:27:22.440
It's very sporadic-y, sporadically written.

03:27:22.440 --> 03:27:24.040
It's okay to be still.

03:27:24.040 --> 03:27:25.720
It's okay to be quiet.

03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:32.080
This is a good, like, and these are over a stretch of.

03:27:32.080 --> 03:27:34.360
That was the first, the first couple of pages

03:27:34.360 --> 03:27:36.320
were from the first night.

03:27:36.320 --> 03:27:37.160
This was just that weekend.

03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:40.640
And you're just there laying looking at the eagles.

03:27:40.640 --> 03:27:44.160
Yeah, with the pen just frantic as well, Lex.

03:27:44.160 --> 03:27:46.160
Not like writing where you're like, oh, I'm just writing.

03:27:46.160 --> 03:27:49.920
It's like, I had to get it down or I was gonna lose it.

03:27:51.880 --> 03:27:54.240
You are warrior.

03:27:54.240 --> 03:27:56.200
You are power.

03:27:56.200 --> 03:27:57.280
You can.

03:27:58.160 --> 03:27:59.480
Choose now.

03:27:59.480 --> 03:28:01.080
Breathe now.

03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:02.440
Be now.

03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:09.280
Be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe.

03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:13.600
Be the strength, you are the strength.

03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:16.680
There's some soul searching going on here.

03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:18.360
This is incredible.

03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:20.480
Yeah, we wait till you get in there.

03:28:20.480 --> 03:28:23.400
I see she gets deep real aggressive, like.

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:28.360
Crack the door, for I am the light.

03:28:29.600 --> 03:28:31.240
The giver, the taker.

03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:35.600
I am warrior, I am life.

03:28:35.600 --> 03:28:39.240
I am air, I am water, I am fire.

03:28:39.240 --> 03:28:40.560
I am light.

03:28:44.040 --> 03:28:46.160
This will, this can.

03:28:46.160 --> 03:28:48.160
This will, this can.

03:28:49.480 --> 03:28:51.040
For I am warrior.

03:28:53.600 --> 03:28:55.200
For I am light.

03:28:55.200 --> 03:28:56.240
And there's a leaf here.

03:28:56.240 --> 03:28:57.920
What's the story with the leaf?

03:28:57.920 --> 03:28:58.760
I don't know.

03:28:58.760 --> 03:29:01.320
I was walking and every single time over those three days,

03:29:01.320 --> 03:29:05.400
anytime I like went for a walk by myself,

03:29:05.400 --> 03:29:08.320
I would just hear like, take this.

03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:10.320
Like just almost like as if a voice was standing there

03:29:10.320 --> 03:29:11.440
and be like, you need this, take it.

03:29:11.440 --> 03:29:12.760
Take it with you and keep it in your book.

03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:15.200
Keep it, ground you.

03:29:16.520 --> 03:29:17.360
And it just goes on.

03:29:17.360 --> 03:29:18.560
So this is from there.

03:29:18.560 --> 03:29:19.400
Yeah.

03:29:19.400 --> 03:29:23.240
It's cool to have sort of, it's almost like time travel.

03:29:23.240 --> 03:29:25.560
I have poppies from France too when I did a,

03:29:25.560 --> 03:29:28.560
I did a 75th anniversary D-Day ride in France

03:29:28.560 --> 03:29:32.080
where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity.

03:29:32.080 --> 03:29:34.920
And we landed on the beaches of Juneau on the 75th

03:29:34.920 --> 03:29:38.040
and we got to go by the poppy fields

03:29:38.040 --> 03:29:40.640
and I'm like covered in poppies.

03:29:40.640 --> 03:29:42.640
And I have some in a book.

03:29:43.520 --> 03:29:44.360
I don't know why I do that.

03:29:44.360 --> 03:29:46.880
I just, I do that.

03:29:46.880 --> 03:29:49.360
That's cool because like these are your thoughts

03:29:49.360 --> 03:29:50.920
and those are the physical items

03:29:50.920 --> 03:29:54.120
as it really helps transport to that place somehow.

03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.040
Let the light in, let her in.

03:30:01.080 --> 03:30:02.760
And she would show me these visuals

03:30:02.760 --> 03:30:04.360
so my drawings are just like, ah.

03:30:08.040 --> 03:30:12.120
Yeah, there's drawings here and you're seeing this stuff.

03:30:12.160 --> 03:30:13.000
Oh yeah.

03:30:14.760 --> 03:30:15.760
I can't draw either.

03:30:15.760 --> 03:30:17.680
So that's why there's so, I wish I could draw

03:30:17.680 --> 03:30:19.840
because if only I could translate

03:30:19.840 --> 03:30:22.880
what I could see visually onto paper.

03:30:24.480 --> 03:30:25.960
And you're talking to her.

03:30:25.960 --> 03:30:27.080
Yeah.

03:30:27.080 --> 03:30:28.280
It's time.

03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:29.440
I'm here to listen.

03:30:31.840 --> 03:30:34.560
Is this Mama Aya?

03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:35.840
Yeah, we call her Mama Aya.

03:30:35.840 --> 03:30:38.160
Mama Aya, Mama Aya.

03:30:38.160 --> 03:30:41.000
So what, who are you seeing?

03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:41.960
Is this a woman?

03:30:42.960 --> 03:30:46.600
So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky.

03:30:46.600 --> 03:30:49.200
These unbelievably gorgeous, beautiful eyes

03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:51.680
that I, and I was like literally looking up

03:30:51.680 --> 03:30:53.560
at the top of the yurt and I kept going to myself,

03:30:53.560 --> 03:30:55.520
is anyone else seeing this?

03:30:55.520 --> 03:30:57.040
There's eyes in the sky.

03:30:57.040 --> 03:30:57.880
Yay.

03:30:57.880 --> 03:30:58.720
Yeah, yeah.

03:30:59.760 --> 03:31:02.720
And so there's these eyes floating

03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:04.560
and they just kept looking at me.

03:31:04.560 --> 03:31:06.800
And I remember when I kept telling myself like,

03:31:06.800 --> 03:31:08.080
don't worry about it, it's nothing there.

03:31:08.080 --> 03:31:09.080
Should we get angry?

03:31:09.560 --> 03:31:12.600
I'm right here, pay attention to me.

03:31:12.600 --> 03:31:14.400
And I'd be like, okay.

03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:17.560
Like forceful, like very forceful.

03:31:17.560 --> 03:31:19.200
So at first it was just the eyes.

03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:25.400
The second night, I sound crazy when I say this.

03:31:30.840 --> 03:31:33.760
Great, that's gonna be my clip, I sound crazy.

03:31:33.760 --> 03:31:35.800
That's what I do when I get uncomfortable.

03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:38.080
I do weird hand gestures and movements.

03:31:39.360 --> 03:31:40.200
I like it.

03:31:40.200 --> 03:31:41.160
Yeah, I do, yeah.

03:31:42.160 --> 03:31:43.360
You would hate to be in my office

03:31:43.360 --> 03:31:46.840
because most of the day it's just this.

03:31:46.840 --> 03:31:47.680
I love it.

03:31:47.680 --> 03:31:50.360
Weird lunges and uncomfortable moments.

03:31:50.360 --> 03:31:53.320
She turned me into a wolf.

03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:58.520
I know I said it out loud, I hear it, I said it.

03:31:58.520 --> 03:31:59.360
Head to toe.

03:32:00.920 --> 03:32:04.760
And her takeaway for me was,

03:32:04.760 --> 03:32:06.800
I'm trying to be this pack leader.

03:32:06.800 --> 03:32:08.400
I'm trying to be this leader in my life.

03:32:08.400 --> 03:32:10.200
I'm trying to do these things,

03:32:10.200 --> 03:32:12.520
but I'm going about them the whole wrong way.

03:32:13.760 --> 03:32:15.200
So like when the shamans call you up

03:32:15.200 --> 03:32:17.480
to do their special prayer over you,

03:32:17.480 --> 03:32:18.880
you go up, you don't touch them.

03:32:18.880 --> 03:32:20.000
They flash their little light.

03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:22.240
You see the little light spot, you walk to the light,

03:32:22.240 --> 03:32:23.960
you sit down on the light.

03:32:23.960 --> 03:32:25.800
And then my shaman, he's so funny

03:32:25.800 --> 03:32:27.520
because he's got this great tone in his voice.

03:32:27.520 --> 03:32:30.440
He goes, how you doing Kelsey?

03:32:31.400 --> 03:32:36.400
And I'm like, so hi, yeah, I have a problem.

03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:39.480
I'm a wolf and I need it to stop.

03:32:39.480 --> 03:32:42.080
And he'd be like, don't you worry, girl, I got you.

03:32:42.080 --> 03:32:42.920
You ready?

03:32:42.920 --> 03:32:45.280
And I was like, uh-huh, uh-huh.

03:32:45.280 --> 03:32:46.360
So I'm sitting there cross-legged.

03:32:46.360 --> 03:32:48.320
I've got my palms out like this.

03:32:48.320 --> 03:32:50.200
And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury.

03:32:50.200 --> 03:32:51.840
So I don't just sit slanted like this.

03:32:51.840 --> 03:32:53.680
My shoulder is actually permanently detached

03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:56.000
and no one in the world will touch it or fix it.

03:32:56.000 --> 03:32:58.400
My collarbone comes out my back here

03:32:58.400 --> 03:33:00.800
and I don't have any collarbone here.

03:33:00.800 --> 03:33:02.400
So nobody will fix it.

03:33:02.400 --> 03:33:03.640
No one will touch it.

03:33:03.640 --> 03:33:05.720
Even I've had specialists, I've had surgeries,

03:33:05.720 --> 03:33:06.880
no one will do anything with it.

03:33:06.880 --> 03:33:09.640
So I'm permanently down and forward.

03:33:09.640 --> 03:33:11.280
So I slouch.

03:33:13.520 --> 03:33:14.880
It's horrible.

03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:15.720
So before I-

03:33:15.720 --> 03:33:16.880
Horrible functionally too?

03:33:16.880 --> 03:33:17.720
Oh, there's nothing.

03:33:17.720 --> 03:33:19.360
I can't do a pull-up anymore.

03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:22.440
Oh, so weak.

03:33:22.440 --> 03:33:23.280
Oh wow.

03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:24.400
Oh, you should, I'll show you how to do a push-up

03:33:24.400 --> 03:33:26.920
after you'll fucking throw up in embarrassment.

03:33:26.920 --> 03:33:27.760
Yeah, it's bad.

03:33:27.760 --> 03:33:29.640
So before I though, chronic pain,

03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:31.920
like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day

03:33:31.920 --> 03:33:33.240
just to the pain is so bad

03:33:33.240 --> 03:33:35.320
because the trauma in it was so bad.

03:33:35.320 --> 03:33:36.960
The surgery went wrong.

03:33:37.960 --> 03:33:40.640
The collarbone dissipated and no longer exists.

03:33:40.640 --> 03:33:42.320
Like there's just, and they're not sure

03:33:42.320 --> 03:33:44.880
how I lift things with it and do stuff with it.

03:33:44.880 --> 03:33:46.880
It's like overcompensation everywhere.

03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:51.880
Like my back, like my scapula like flares outward.

03:33:53.240 --> 03:33:54.800
I'm all messed up from it.

03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:56.400
And so I was in chronic pain.

03:33:56.400 --> 03:33:58.320
So he's praying over me.

03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:00.480
And all of a sudden, all I feel

03:34:00.480 --> 03:34:04.360
is this arm just start just fucking vibrating.

03:34:04.360 --> 03:34:05.800
And my hair is really long.

03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:08.440
And I feel somebody grab the back of my ponytail

03:34:08.440 --> 03:34:11.040
and snap my head back like this.

03:34:11.920 --> 03:34:15.440
And it felt like something was coming out of my throat,

03:34:15.440 --> 03:34:17.920
like being pulled out of me.

03:34:18.840 --> 03:34:21.040
And the takeaway that I end up in the whole,

03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:22.560
the rest of the night, there was a million other things,

03:34:22.560 --> 03:34:24.120
but the takeaway was,

03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:30.080
you no longer need to bite.

03:34:30.080 --> 03:34:32.520
You may only show your teeth.

03:34:32.520 --> 03:34:35.240
You can be the leader that you want to be.

03:34:35.240 --> 03:34:39.400
You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.

03:34:39.400 --> 03:34:41.040
You can be in the back of the pack.

03:34:41.040 --> 03:34:44.120
You have to watch the rest around you.

03:34:44.120 --> 03:34:46.520
Be mindful of those around you.

03:34:46.520 --> 03:34:50.520
Instead of just being upfront, be behind as well.

03:34:50.520 --> 03:34:52.440
Make sure that everything that you're doing

03:34:52.440 --> 03:34:54.480
is all being looked after.

03:34:54.480 --> 03:34:57.080
Because my thing was I will rip your fucking head off

03:34:57.080 --> 03:34:59.720
if you just say the wrong thing to me before.

03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:01.920
The whole thing was you can just show your teeth

03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:03.480
and that is more than enough.

03:35:03.480 --> 03:35:07.120
Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.

03:35:07.120 --> 03:35:09.280
You don't need to do that any longer.

03:35:09.280 --> 03:35:12.640
And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen,

03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:16.000
like where I was in my house

03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:19.880
and there were these flyers all over my husband and my son.

03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:22.560
And like, I went ham on them.

03:35:22.560 --> 03:35:24.560
I like shredded them to pieces.

03:35:24.560 --> 03:35:27.680
Like I was this protector.

03:35:27.680 --> 03:35:30.960
And it's crazy because the guys told me after,

03:35:31.040 --> 03:35:32.280
someone would be like,

03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:35.040
there were flyers all over you the whole night.

03:35:35.040 --> 03:35:36.120
They were just all over you.

03:35:36.120 --> 03:35:39.080
And I'm like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.

03:35:39.080 --> 03:35:40.840
The shaman had to be like,

03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:43.120
I need you to try to calm your breathing.

03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:44.560
After I could, but before,

03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:49.560
I was attacking things beside me that people could see

03:35:49.640 --> 03:35:52.640
and I could see, but couldn't wrap my brain around

03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:53.480
that they were real.

03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:55.920
It was fucking weird.

03:35:56.960 --> 03:35:58.200
It was crazy, man.

03:35:58.200 --> 03:35:59.160
That's day two.

03:35:59.160 --> 03:36:00.600
That's day two.

03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:03.680
So what's the big takeaway there?

03:36:03.680 --> 03:36:05.720
My takeaway was I needed to be,

03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:11.600
I needed to stop trying to push everything too hard.

03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:14.440
Stop trying to force everything.

03:36:14.440 --> 03:36:15.600
It's all going to come.

03:36:15.600 --> 03:36:20.120
It's all going to happen, but you are too aggressive.

03:36:20.120 --> 03:36:23.160
You are too, you're trying so hard

03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:26.040
that you're missing everything else.

03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:26.960
Got it.

03:36:26.960 --> 03:36:30.280
That's just how to be a better human kind of thing.

03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:31.120
Right.

03:36:32.600 --> 03:36:34.760
This is getting intense.

03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:36.960
Yeah, it gets aggressive.

03:36:36.960 --> 03:36:38.360
Yeah, it gets aggressive.

03:36:39.760 --> 03:36:42.440
I mean, there's love and light still.

03:36:42.440 --> 03:36:44.480
It gets better. Love and light.

03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:46.880
Love and light, the warrior within is calm.

03:36:48.520 --> 03:36:50.360
She will test you daily.

03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:52.040
Show her respect.

03:36:52.040 --> 03:36:52.880
So that's what I mean.

03:36:52.880 --> 03:36:55.240
You've read my book, you know I don't write like that.

03:36:55.240 --> 03:36:57.000
Yeah, this is strange.

03:36:57.000 --> 03:36:57.840
See?

03:36:57.840 --> 03:36:59.440
Good, you get it.

03:36:59.480 --> 03:37:02.560
Cause people don't understand when I say I didn't,

03:37:02.560 --> 03:37:04.720
I don't feel like I wrote that.

03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:06.120
I feel like she gave me,

03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:09.080
like I reread this all of the time.

03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:12.720
So I wonder, I mean, well, not obviously,

03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:16.240
but this is somehow part of you.

03:37:16.240 --> 03:37:18.320
I think it's a part of me, obviously.

03:37:18.320 --> 03:37:20.440
Reconnecting you somehow to that part.

03:37:20.440 --> 03:37:22.760
It kind of is incredible to think of

03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:24.520
what are the things that are part of us

03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:26.840
that we haven't really explored, you know?

03:37:26.840 --> 03:37:28.000
And there's so many.

03:37:28.840 --> 03:37:29.680
We just get-

03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:31.440
Nature, to connect to her.

03:37:31.440 --> 03:37:34.240
Feel her flow through them.

03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:37.120
Use them for the strength for each day

03:37:37.120 --> 03:37:39.000
a new challenge will present itself.

03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:42.040
Love, light, breathe.

03:37:43.320 --> 03:37:44.880
Sorry, I have too much hair.

03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.840
Never enough. I used to have long hair.

03:37:46.840 --> 03:37:48.360
What about day three?

03:37:48.360 --> 03:37:52.520
So day three is the stuff I talked about on Jocko

03:37:52.520 --> 03:37:55.160
when I got taken over to the other side.

03:37:55.160 --> 03:37:57.280
I almost missed that night too.

03:37:57.280 --> 03:37:59.200
I almost missed that ceremony.

03:37:59.200 --> 03:38:02.480
I got a false positive on my COVID test

03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:05.920
and I got a call from the medical clinic that night

03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:07.840
being like, you need to come in.

03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:09.840
You got a false positive on your COVID test

03:38:09.840 --> 03:38:12.960
and if you're gonna travel, you have to,

03:38:12.960 --> 03:38:14.080
we gotta figure this out.

03:38:14.080 --> 03:38:15.040
You gotta come do blood work.

03:38:15.040 --> 03:38:16.960
You gotta come do, you know,

03:38:16.960 --> 03:38:19.280
whatever it is you need to do if you wanna get home,

03:38:19.280 --> 03:38:21.120
but you gotta come do something.

03:38:21.120 --> 03:38:24.920
And so I didn't think I was gonna be in ceremony.

03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:25.800
I had to leave.

03:38:25.800 --> 03:38:30.800
So I left and, you know, they waited.

03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:34.200
They waited for me.

03:38:35.480 --> 03:38:39.320
And so I think the biggest takeaway from all of this

03:38:39.320 --> 03:38:43.400
for me was this isn't it.

03:38:43.400 --> 03:38:45.160
This isn't everything.

03:38:45.160 --> 03:38:49.360
This isn't the end all be all.

03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:50.880
You can fight through this.

03:38:50.880 --> 03:38:52.360
This is possible.

03:38:52.360 --> 03:38:53.400
It's gonna take work.

03:38:53.400 --> 03:38:55.400
It's gonna be fucking hard.

03:38:55.400 --> 03:38:57.280
It's worth it though.

03:38:57.280 --> 03:38:58.760
And if you just keep going in the right direction,

03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:00.520
everything that I wrote down,

03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:03.360
everything, every goal, it'll happen.

03:39:04.840 --> 03:39:06.920
What about love?

03:39:06.920 --> 03:39:07.840
What about love?

03:39:09.400 --> 03:39:10.800
Tell me about your husband.

03:39:10.800 --> 03:39:12.520
Okay, he's the best.

03:39:12.520 --> 03:39:15.880
What role did he play in your life?

03:39:15.880 --> 03:39:17.360
The most pivotal role.

03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:20.520
He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough

03:39:20.520 --> 03:39:23.560
to until I knew that I was worthy enough to be alive.

03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:26.320
Can you dissect that a little bit?

03:39:26.320 --> 03:39:29.400
Like what, I mean, what role does love play

03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:31.080
in the human condition?

03:39:31.080 --> 03:39:33.680
I think love is the only reason

03:39:33.680 --> 03:39:35.440
that we haven't destroyed ourselves.

03:39:37.440 --> 03:39:39.000
I mean, we humans in general.

03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:41.960
Yes, I think there is a subset of people

03:39:41.960 --> 03:39:45.680
where love will always be, you know,

03:39:45.680 --> 03:39:47.280
love conquers all, you know,

03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:49.680
but that's not always the reality.

03:39:49.680 --> 03:39:54.240
The reality is life is messy and humans are messy.

03:39:54.240 --> 03:39:56.560
And the way we choose to deal with things are messy

03:39:56.560 --> 03:39:58.040
and complicated and difficult,

03:39:58.040 --> 03:40:02.480
but at the root of all good is love, I think.

03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:07.080
And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband

03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:12.080
through a friend, which you listened to that podcast,

03:40:12.080 --> 03:40:14.480
so I don't know that we need to,

03:40:14.480 --> 03:40:16.480
unless you really wanna go into that story again,

03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:18.360
how I met my husband.

03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:20.560
Well, the only part of that story I like,

03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:22.520
people should just go listen to the Jocko podcast,

03:40:22.520 --> 03:40:24.920
it's how you made him uncomfortable, I love it.

03:40:24.920 --> 03:40:26.680
Well, okay, so how it works, let me explain.

03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:28.600
In the supercross and motocross industry,

03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:29.440
it's really small.

03:40:29.440 --> 03:40:30.960
The people who are professional,

03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:32.120
it's a small subset of people.

03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:33.560
It's kind of like Formula One,

03:40:33.560 --> 03:40:35.720
21 cars, that's what there is.

03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:36.560
That's the amount of riders.

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:40.160
And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.

03:40:40.160 --> 03:40:41.760
My husband was a professional supercross

03:40:41.760 --> 03:40:44.120
and motocross racer for his whole life.

03:40:44.120 --> 03:40:48.520
And he raced for Kawasaki and Suzuki,

03:40:48.520 --> 03:40:51.200
he lived in California and raced all down there.

03:40:51.200 --> 03:40:54.120
And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.

03:40:54.120 --> 03:40:58.240
And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine

03:40:58.240 --> 03:41:02.200
to see somebody that I was currently sleeping with,

03:41:02.200 --> 03:41:03.840
who was a friend of mine,

03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:08.840
and end up meeting Brady instead.

03:41:08.880 --> 03:41:11.000
Yeah, and the funny moment in Jocko's podcast.

03:41:11.000 --> 03:41:13.160
Was saying that I was fucking him

03:41:13.160 --> 03:41:14.840
instead of just sleeping with him.

03:41:14.840 --> 03:41:16.880
And then Jocko's face exploded.

03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:18.600
Jocko was like, oh, sleeping.

03:41:18.600 --> 03:41:22.240
So he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters

03:41:22.240 --> 03:41:24.520
that you're, he was trying to get you to define

03:41:24.520 --> 03:41:26.720
as a good interviewer would, oh, sleeping, okay.

03:41:26.720 --> 03:41:29.560
And then you were like, it's fucking Jocko.

03:41:31.240 --> 03:41:33.080
Something like that, it was great.

03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:34.040
It was great.

03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:35.840
But that's true, because in that industry,

03:41:35.840 --> 03:41:38.680
it's like we, it's small, we all share.

03:41:38.680 --> 03:41:41.440
Trust me, this is what it is.

03:41:41.440 --> 03:41:42.600
And it was, so I met him there

03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:44.880
and he had broken his wrist really, really bad.

03:41:44.880 --> 03:41:48.560
And I was, this was before I deployed.

03:41:48.560 --> 03:41:51.760
So I met him and I, we stayed in touch

03:41:51.760 --> 03:41:54.120
and just became friends and just texted.

03:41:54.120 --> 03:41:55.480
That was it, nothing weird.

03:41:55.480 --> 03:41:57.520
And I was deploying though.

03:41:57.520 --> 03:42:00.120
So we disagreed, you know, we'd be friends.

03:42:00.120 --> 03:42:02.320
We weren't actually talking about anything

03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:03.840
romantically at all.

03:42:03.840 --> 03:42:07.560
And then I deployed and we got talking

03:42:07.560 --> 03:42:10.560
and to know each other a little more, a little more.

03:42:10.560 --> 03:42:12.560
And then we decided that we liked each other

03:42:12.560 --> 03:42:15.400
and we wanted to try to give it at least a semi-shot.

03:42:15.400 --> 03:42:17.720
And so when I got home from Afghanistan,

03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:21.560
I went and watched him race his last,

03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:25.080
one of his last two races that he did professionally

03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:26.960
before he retired, excuse me.

03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:29.600
And it was in Montreal and one was in Vegas.

03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:34.600
And I hadn't seen him and he didn't really know me.

03:42:35.000 --> 03:42:36.440
We didn't really know each other.

03:42:36.440 --> 03:42:39.160
We, you know, we met, I slept in the bed beside him

03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:41.160
because my girlfriend didn't want to get in trouble

03:42:41.160 --> 03:42:43.920
from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude.

03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:49.160
And then, yeah, we just, we started dating

03:42:49.160 --> 03:42:53.240
and he really slowly became my rock

03:42:53.240 --> 03:42:55.440
and he understands trauma.

03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:58.000
He had some stuff happen in his life, in his family

03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:00.640
that he went through a lot of therapy.

03:43:00.640 --> 03:43:01.600
He went through a lot of shit.

03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:05.440
He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do

03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:07.920
to a family and to people and those that are suffering

03:43:07.920 --> 03:43:09.360
with it.

03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:14.360
And so he was well equipped to handle me, thankfully.

03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:17.720
And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance

03:43:17.720 --> 03:43:19.120
back and forth, back and forth and back and forth.

03:43:19.120 --> 03:43:21.040
And I finally got the call that I was gonna be released

03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:24.600
from the military and I wanted to live near him

03:43:24.600 --> 03:43:26.320
but I couldn't afford to live in British Columbia

03:43:26.320 --> 03:43:28.680
because I was from Ontario and BC is like,

03:43:28.680 --> 03:43:31.240
it means bring cash for a reason.

03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:32.360
I'm like, there's no way I can live there.

03:43:32.360 --> 03:43:36.200
And then his family was like, come live with us.

03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:40.440
They had a big enough house, trust me, it was fine.

03:43:40.440 --> 03:43:42.320
So I was like, okay.

03:43:42.320 --> 03:43:45.200
And so I went from like dating this guy long distance

03:43:45.200 --> 03:43:48.880
to over, from 2009 to 2011, just back and forth,

03:43:48.880 --> 03:43:50.680
back and forth, back and forth.

03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:51.840
And then finally his parents were like,

03:43:51.840 --> 03:43:53.280
should her get off the pot here with her?

03:43:53.280 --> 03:43:56.560
Like, come on, it's obvious she loves you

03:43:56.560 --> 03:43:58.160
and I would never say it.

03:43:58.160 --> 03:44:01.200
That word just as a love, like it was just, I couldn't.

03:44:01.200 --> 03:44:05.240
For a long time, for a long time.

03:44:05.240 --> 03:44:06.440
Cause I was dead inside.

03:44:07.800 --> 03:44:10.840
I didn't know what that meant because I couldn't feel.

03:44:10.840 --> 03:44:11.680
I didn't feel anything.

03:44:11.680 --> 03:44:15.040
He loved it because he like, we go do something,

03:44:15.040 --> 03:44:17.440
you would never complain about anything.

03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:19.720
You wouldn't say a fucking word.

03:44:19.720 --> 03:44:23.240
You would just sit there and now you got all your feelings

03:44:23.240 --> 03:44:26.080
back and your emotions back and now you're too hot

03:44:26.080 --> 03:44:27.680
and you're too cold.

03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:29.600
Anyways, so yeah, he loved it.

03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:30.840
I was numb and dead inside.

03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:32.280
Seriously, when I call him back.

03:44:32.560 --> 03:44:34.040
Were you still able to have fun together,

03:44:34.040 --> 03:44:34.880
that kind of thing?

03:44:34.880 --> 03:44:37.280
Like when you say there's no emotion,

03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:40.320
there's more emotion around the basics of everyday life,

03:44:41.400 --> 03:44:43.920
but you were still able to just enjoy shit together?

03:44:43.920 --> 03:44:48.440
I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't feeling.

03:44:48.440 --> 03:44:49.280
Yeah.

03:44:49.280 --> 03:44:50.320
I was like, this is fun.

03:44:50.320 --> 03:44:52.440
Yeah, right.

03:44:52.440 --> 03:44:53.280
That was it.

03:44:53.280 --> 03:44:57.000
That was surface level, like, Lex, this is fun.

03:44:57.000 --> 03:44:57.840
It wasn't.

03:44:57.840 --> 03:44:59.360
There's nothing there, yeah.

03:44:59.360 --> 03:45:00.200
No, there's nothing there.

03:45:00.200 --> 03:45:02.240
Hey, yeah, nothing.

03:45:03.240 --> 03:45:04.080
And so we went through that for a long time.

03:45:04.080 --> 03:45:07.200
And then I lived with his parents and we lived there

03:45:07.200 --> 03:45:09.120
and that was, you know, goddamn it,

03:45:09.120 --> 03:45:13.000
his family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.

03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:13.840
I was a nightmare.

03:45:13.840 --> 03:45:15.600
Couldn't cook certain food around me anymore.

03:45:15.600 --> 03:45:17.760
Couldn't go certain places with me anymore.

03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:20.880
Couldn't, you know, crowds were in hard no.

03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:22.080
We didn't do Canada today.

03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:23.240
And I'm like, I just changed.

03:45:23.240 --> 03:45:26.840
I moved in and was like, shit's gotta changed

03:45:26.840 --> 03:45:28.680
if you guys don't want me to kill everyone.

03:45:28.680 --> 03:45:30.680
Like, and they were willing

03:45:30.720 --> 03:45:33.960
and they were accepting and they were amazing about it.

03:45:33.960 --> 03:45:36.240
And then we finally said, okay, well, like,

03:45:36.240 --> 03:45:37.720
is this, we're good?

03:45:37.720 --> 03:45:42.720
We're like, I used to say like, I L you.

03:45:42.720 --> 03:45:44.320
Like, I couldn't say love.

03:45:44.320 --> 03:45:46.600
It freaked me out for a long time.

03:45:46.600 --> 03:45:48.040
And then I finally said it.

03:45:48.040 --> 03:45:50.280
And then that shit had said it like a month later.

03:45:50.280 --> 03:45:51.240
And I was like, that's not fair.

03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:52.520
You should have said it at the same exact time.

03:45:52.520 --> 03:45:54.360
I wanted the response.

03:45:54.360 --> 03:45:56.680
And he goes to treatment with me.

03:45:56.680 --> 03:45:58.880
He, whatever I need.

03:45:58.880 --> 03:46:01.280
He knows that like, hey, it's more for like him.

03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:02.840
I'm like, how do I handle her?

03:46:03.800 --> 03:46:06.480
And then we moved out and we bought a house.

03:46:06.480 --> 03:46:07.920
And then he took a sweet ass time.

03:46:07.920 --> 03:46:10.600
We were dating for four years before we were engaged.

03:46:10.600 --> 03:46:14.240
Cause just to be sure the crazy wasn't too crazy.

03:46:14.240 --> 03:46:15.480
He waited four years on that.

03:46:15.480 --> 03:46:16.320
A smart man.

03:46:16.320 --> 03:46:17.160
Right? Yeah.

03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:19.600
Or you can, you could say he's just a terrified

03:46:19.600 --> 03:46:20.920
of commitment, but both.

03:46:20.920 --> 03:46:21.880
A little bit of both.

03:46:21.880 --> 03:46:23.840
Hey, when you were the guy on the posters

03:46:23.840 --> 03:46:25.760
that all the girls sign up to,

03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:27.160
that sent all the dirty pictures,

03:46:27.160 --> 03:46:28.320
fucking why are you giving that up?

03:46:28.320 --> 03:46:29.160
It's easy.

03:46:29.160 --> 03:46:31.520
Yeah. Commitment is a real commitment then.

03:46:31.520 --> 03:46:32.360
Yeah.

03:46:33.480 --> 03:46:34.320
Okay.

03:46:34.320 --> 03:46:35.920
This is the Jaco reset.

03:46:37.680 --> 03:46:39.920
We talked about brass and unity a little bit.

03:46:39.920 --> 03:46:43.080
What's the long-term mission goal and dream

03:46:43.080 --> 03:46:47.600
of your company and the podcast of the same name?

03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:50.000
So for me, what I've been trying to do

03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:53.040
with this company is create a community

03:46:53.080 --> 03:46:56.120
that can really work together

03:46:56.120 --> 03:46:58.440
to not only help vets first responders,

03:46:58.440 --> 03:47:01.440
but to really bridge the gap with the civilian population

03:47:01.440 --> 03:47:03.520
and letting them know what we kind of go through

03:47:03.520 --> 03:47:05.760
and why it is such a epidemic

03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:08.320
and why there is over 22 suicides a day.

03:47:08.320 --> 03:47:11.320
And we are losing people like it's going out of style.

03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:13.280
Like the amount of vets that are questioning

03:47:13.280 --> 03:47:18.200
the last 20 years of their life right now is terrifying.

03:47:18.200 --> 03:47:20.240
The, you know, I work with organizations

03:47:20.240 --> 03:47:21.480
that are doing this outreach

03:47:21.480 --> 03:47:22.480
and they're overloaded right now.

03:47:22.480 --> 03:47:24.160
Like they have never seen before

03:47:24.160 --> 03:47:27.880
because this whole thing is just, it's hit a head here.

03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:31.240
And so what brass and unity tries to do is

03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:33.200
it is really just a vehicle to get the money

03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:35.600
in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it.

03:47:35.600 --> 03:47:37.000
I couldn't start a nonprofit

03:47:37.000 --> 03:47:38.760
because I'm not good at fundraising.

03:47:38.760 --> 03:47:40.800
I'm not good at being like, give me your money.

03:47:40.800 --> 03:47:42.920
I'm going to do this with it.

03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:45.280
The least I could do was come up with a product

03:47:45.280 --> 03:47:48.600
that I know I could give to people or people could purchase.

03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:51.720
And if I gave pretty much all of the prof,

03:47:52.320 --> 03:47:56.560
the actual profit from it to those organizations

03:47:56.560 --> 03:48:00.440
and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece

03:48:00.440 --> 03:48:03.040
or if they're out and somebody sees a bullet on the wrist

03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:04.760
and go, hey, what is that?

03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:07.000
It's a conversation starter.

03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:09.000
And that's exactly what it's been.

03:48:09.000 --> 03:48:10.760
And it's done its job as that.

03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:13.640
And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle.

03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:14.480
We're the vehicle.

03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:15.680
We're the money in the hands of the people.

03:48:15.680 --> 03:48:18.400
People don't always want to just get a tax receipt.

03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:20.320
It's great to donate to something.

03:48:20.320 --> 03:48:21.640
Great on you to do that.

03:48:22.520 --> 03:48:24.960
But most people have a selfish aspect, right?

03:48:24.960 --> 03:48:25.800
And that's okay.

03:48:25.800 --> 03:48:27.680
But if you can tap into that,

03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:30.160
you can then fund these charities properly

03:48:30.160 --> 03:48:32.920
and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively.

03:48:32.920 --> 03:48:33.760
Up until this point,

03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:36.680
they just count on people's goodness of their hearts.

03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:37.920
Hate to break it to you.

03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:39.520
Humanity is rough right now.

03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:41.640
We need to look at something a little differently.

03:48:41.640 --> 03:48:45.600
So these things spark, like Julie sparks conversations

03:48:45.600 --> 03:48:47.760
and then do you work with charities?

03:48:47.760 --> 03:48:48.600
Yes. Oh God, yeah.

03:48:48.600 --> 03:48:49.600
That's what I do.

03:48:49.680 --> 03:48:51.960
My whole mission every day is I get up,

03:48:51.960 --> 03:48:55.520
I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and say,

03:48:55.520 --> 03:48:57.240
but now that you're gonna wear that,

03:48:57.240 --> 03:48:59.040
now you're a part of the Be In You Army.

03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:00.880
Now you're a part of this community.

03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:05.360
Speaking of which, let me put it right back on.

03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:08.160
Branded, this is organic product placement.

03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:10.280
Yeah, this isn't like marketing at all

03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:11.960
or nothing weird about this at all.

03:49:11.960 --> 03:49:14.520
And so we work with a lot of organizations

03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:17.000
and I'm very particular about where we send our money

03:49:17.000 --> 03:49:19.600
because it feels like thousands

03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:21.440
of vet organizations right now.

03:49:21.440 --> 03:49:25.080
And if we were able to consolidate, it would be more ideal.

03:49:25.080 --> 03:49:26.480
I spoke about that on another show,

03:49:26.480 --> 03:49:28.000
but that's not currently happening.

03:49:28.000 --> 03:49:29.920
So I try to work with the nonprofits.

03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:32.720
I know number one are not paying six figure salaries,

03:49:32.720 --> 03:49:35.960
which trust me, there's lots, a lot.

03:49:35.960 --> 03:49:38.440
Number two, I look at the actual resources

03:49:38.440 --> 03:49:39.280
that they're providing

03:49:39.280 --> 03:49:40.400
and if they're going to be something

03:49:40.400 --> 03:49:42.400
that are gonna be useful in my opinion,

03:49:42.400 --> 03:49:43.880
whether or not they're actually useful

03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:46.400
and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate.

03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:47.560
I know what's worked for me,

03:49:47.560 --> 03:49:49.400
so I try to fund the things that I know

03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:52.600
have been helpful for me and the people I associate with.

03:49:52.600 --> 03:49:54.960
So that's why I brought all the paper

03:49:54.960 --> 03:49:57.240
because I didn't wanna be an idiot

03:49:57.240 --> 03:49:58.840
and forget anybody that's really important

03:49:58.840 --> 03:50:00.440
because I get caught up in things

03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:01.640
and I think it's important to acknowledge.

03:50:01.640 --> 03:50:04.080
So number one, Heroic Hearts.

03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:08.760
We just started working to talk about them

03:50:08.760 --> 03:50:10.200
and really make them known,

03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:12.280
but we're gonna be donating to them as well.

03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:14.920
Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?

03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:16.680
Yeah, so their points are,

03:50:16.680 --> 03:50:17.960
I got Jesse to actually,

03:50:17.960 --> 03:50:19.280
I'm like, what are your talking points

03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:21.800
because I need people to know exactly what you do.

03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:23.640
So veterans have had to take their mental

03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:25.160
and general health into their own hands

03:50:25.160 --> 03:50:27.120
due to the failure of the government system,

03:50:27.120 --> 03:50:29.040
so that is why they were created.

03:50:29.040 --> 03:50:31.640
But Heroic Hearts is a peer-supported mental health network

03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:34.480
involving full preparation, integration coaching

03:50:34.480 --> 03:50:36.560
and connection to vetted psychedelic treatments.

03:50:36.560 --> 03:50:38.560
So they don't just do AYA,

03:50:38.560 --> 03:50:42.120
they deal with psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine,

03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:43.920
but they've got protocols in place,

03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:46.720
they've got locations you go to that are safely vetted

03:50:46.720 --> 03:50:48.080
and they work.

03:50:48.080 --> 03:50:49.920
They've got over right now,

03:50:49.920 --> 03:50:51.960
Jesse said they have over 800 veterans

03:50:51.960 --> 03:50:53.560
on a waiting list for treatment.

03:50:53.560 --> 03:50:56.560
That's just before the spike of the end of this war.

03:50:57.880 --> 03:50:59.320
They have over a hundred,

03:50:59.320 --> 03:51:00.960
they've helped over a hundred veterans

03:51:00.960 --> 03:51:03.360
including dozens of special operation vets

03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:04.880
find effective care.

03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:07.720
They've now got branches in the US, UK and Canada.

03:51:07.720 --> 03:51:09.360
And the biggest thing about them

03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:11.600
and why we talk about them is because

03:51:11.600 --> 03:51:14.720
the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it

03:51:14.720 --> 03:51:15.880
is so significant,

03:51:15.880 --> 03:51:18.400
but because of great universities that are now stepping up

03:51:18.400 --> 03:51:20.040
and doing the research behind it,

03:51:20.040 --> 03:51:21.360
it is being legitimized.

03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:23.080
So like they're doing that.

03:51:23.080 --> 03:51:25.680
In Canada, there's a group called Therasil.

03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:27.480
They are currently fighting the government

03:51:27.480 --> 03:51:30.560
to get the rights for Canadians under section 56

03:51:30.560 --> 03:51:35.000
of our laws to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.

03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:37.960
I've done a panel with them on that really great base

03:51:37.960 --> 03:51:40.360
out of Victoria, really smart people.

03:51:40.360 --> 03:51:42.560
One of the other bigger charities that we work with

03:51:42.560 --> 03:51:44.000
and they're honestly,

03:51:44.000 --> 03:51:45.520
they were my first and foremost charity

03:51:45.520 --> 03:51:46.400
that I ever worked with.

03:51:46.400 --> 03:51:48.360
And they're a big component

03:51:48.360 --> 03:51:50.960
in the veteran community in Canada.

03:51:50.960 --> 03:51:52.280
They're called Honor House.

03:51:52.280 --> 03:51:57.280
And Honor House was started by honorary Colonel Al DeGenova.

03:51:57.600 --> 03:52:00.040
It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.

03:52:00.040 --> 03:52:02.720
He was a Canadian soldier who deployed

03:52:02.720 --> 03:52:04.920
and he was a captain Trevor Green.

03:52:04.920 --> 03:52:05.920
Sorry, Trevor.

03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:08.120
Captain Trevor Green.

03:52:08.160 --> 03:52:10.480
He got an ax in the middle of his head.

03:52:10.480 --> 03:52:12.800
A Taliban member came up and put an ax directly

03:52:12.800 --> 03:52:15.920
into his head when his helmet was off and he survived.

03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:19.360
He's done work with Invictus Games and Prince Harry.

03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:21.960
He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.

03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:23.280
He's so cool.

03:52:23.280 --> 03:52:26.640
He hasn't changed one bit from like the infantry captain

03:52:26.640 --> 03:52:28.960
you expect him to be.

03:52:28.960 --> 03:52:32.080
And it was, Al saw there was a need for vets

03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:34.560
and first responders to get treatment

03:52:34.560 --> 03:52:37.520
because there's no real home away from home for people.

03:52:37.520 --> 03:52:40.440
Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families.

03:52:40.440 --> 03:52:42.280
This is vets and first responders.

03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:44.680
And so their whole thing, and I'll read it

03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:45.760
so I say it exactly right.

03:52:45.760 --> 03:52:47.240
Cause I used to be on the board of their charity

03:52:47.240 --> 03:52:50.000
but I ran out of time so now I just consult.

03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:52.400
But they are a home away from home

03:52:52.400 --> 03:52:54.960
for members of the Canadian Armed Forces,

03:52:54.960 --> 03:52:56.280
veterans and first responders

03:52:56.280 --> 03:52:59.720
and their families to stay completely free of charge

03:52:59.720 --> 03:53:01.160
while they're receiving medical care

03:53:01.160 --> 03:53:03.560
and treatment in the Vancouver area.

03:53:03.560 --> 03:53:06.400
But since then they've expanded, since I've come on board

03:53:06.440 --> 03:53:10.040
and they've opened Honor Ranch, which is up in Ashcroft, BC.

03:53:10.040 --> 03:53:14.000
And it's 140 acres, 10 cabins and a main cabin.

03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:16.480
They do EC1 therapy and they're more focused

03:53:16.480 --> 03:53:18.080
on operational stress injury clinic.

03:53:18.080 --> 03:53:20.600
So sorry, operational stress injury

03:53:20.600 --> 03:53:22.240
within the veteran community.

03:53:22.240 --> 03:53:24.200
And they have specialists that do that.

03:53:24.200 --> 03:53:27.040
They have their own bracelet with us.

03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:28.680
So every time you buy an Honor House bracelet

03:53:28.680 --> 03:53:30.240
all the proceeds go to them.

03:53:30.240 --> 03:53:33.680
They, yeah, and it's actually the green one.

03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:35.280
So that one, so when you buy one

03:53:35.280 --> 03:53:37.960
of those Honor House bracelets, they have those,

03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:41.120
they go directly to them, which is really amazing.

03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:44.440
They've been near and dear to my heart for a long time.

03:53:44.440 --> 03:53:46.480
You've got the All Secure Foundation,

03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:49.160
which is these guys are super dope.

03:53:49.160 --> 03:53:50.880
I'm gonna read exactly, cause Jen texts me.

03:53:50.880 --> 03:53:54.560
So Jen and Tom Satterly, I've had them both on the podcast.

03:53:54.560 --> 03:53:56.400
Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

03:53:57.840 --> 03:54:00.160
Tom is a Delta, have you heard of them?

03:54:00.160 --> 03:54:03.320
But no, no, no.

03:54:03.320 --> 03:54:05.160
So, okay, so Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:06.920
It was one of his first operations.

03:54:06.920 --> 03:54:08.240
He's a Delta operator.

03:54:08.240 --> 03:54:09.480
And I asked her, I said, listen,

03:54:09.480 --> 03:54:10.480
I'm gonna be doing these shows.

03:54:10.480 --> 03:54:12.080
And I think it's great that we talk about you more.

03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:15.400
So I said, give me your three points of importance.

03:54:15.400 --> 03:54:17.320
So the All Secure Foundation

03:54:17.320 --> 03:54:19.560
serves special operations combat families

03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:21.480
in healing from post-traumatic stress injury

03:54:21.480 --> 03:54:23.280
and secondary post-traumatic stress.

03:54:23.280 --> 03:54:25.520
So that's often what the wife or the other husband

03:54:25.520 --> 03:54:27.920
or the other spouse suffers from.

03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:28.760
And we're starting to see that

03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:31.120
be more and more of an issue now.

03:54:31.120 --> 03:54:33.080
So they also are devoted to rebuilding

03:54:33.080 --> 03:54:35.040
the couple's relationships on the home front

03:54:35.040 --> 03:54:36.560
after the separations of war.

03:54:36.560 --> 03:54:39.360
And 80% of their warriors went on,

03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:42.960
went, yeah, 80% of their warriors

03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:45.160
want their families to be more involved with the healing.

03:54:45.160 --> 03:54:48.880
The problem is, is very often vets don't realize

03:54:48.880 --> 03:54:49.760
that they can have,

03:54:49.760 --> 03:54:52.360
or just because the system doesn't pay for it,

03:54:52.360 --> 03:54:54.520
actually have their spouse as a part of things.

03:54:54.520 --> 03:54:55.800
And the biggest thing that we find

03:54:55.800 --> 03:54:57.160
with special operations families,

03:54:57.160 --> 03:54:59.000
I think the divorce rate's like 95%.

03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:03.360
And so they work so hard with these families.

03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:04.440
They take them on retreats.

03:55:04.440 --> 03:55:05.280
These husband and wives,

03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:06.520
and they get them to connect again

03:55:06.520 --> 03:55:09.560
after being separated over such a long period of time.

03:55:09.560 --> 03:55:10.400
There's other places

03:55:10.400 --> 03:55:12.760
like Children's of Fallen Patriots at a DC

03:55:12.760 --> 03:55:14.800
where they fund education,

03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:18.120
university for people who have lost their parents

03:55:18.120 --> 03:55:19.400
in deployments.

03:55:19.400 --> 03:55:21.280
Whether the kid's even born yet.

03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:23.000
If they're still in utero, they still pay.

03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:24.480
They do not care.

03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:26.800
Then you've got people like in Canada,

03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:28.520
you've got Vets Canada.

03:55:28.520 --> 03:55:31.960
You've got in the States, you've got True Patriot Love.

03:55:31.960 --> 03:55:35.880
You've got who else in the States is really great

03:55:35.880 --> 03:55:36.880
that we've worked with.

03:55:36.880 --> 03:55:39.040
I know there's a Green Beret Foundation that's great.

03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:41.200
One More Wave gives amputees,

03:55:41.200 --> 03:55:44.000
teaches them to surf with amputees.

03:55:44.000 --> 03:55:45.080
They're really great.

03:55:45.080 --> 03:55:46.840
There's so many organizations,

03:55:46.840 --> 03:55:48.720
but at the end of the day,

03:55:48.720 --> 03:55:50.560
I focus on a small subset

03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:54.160
because you cannot fix everyone's problems.

03:55:54.160 --> 03:55:57.920
The least you can do for people is focus.

03:55:57.920 --> 03:55:59.360
If you can provide focus,

03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:01.160
you can provide the proper amount of funding,

03:56:01.200 --> 03:56:03.560
proper amount of funding can give the proper amount of tools.

03:56:03.560 --> 03:56:06.680
Those tools can actually be implemented properly.

03:56:06.680 --> 03:56:08.240
And then those people can go on

03:56:08.240 --> 03:56:11.600
to hopefully have successful marriages and families.

03:56:11.600 --> 03:56:13.440
And we don't have to watch our parents

03:56:13.440 --> 03:56:14.440
drink themselves to death

03:56:14.440 --> 03:56:16.720
and wonder why daddy's yelling at mommy all the time.

03:56:16.720 --> 03:56:18.480
And daddy storms out leaves.

03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:20.200
Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life

03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:21.680
and mommy had some shit happen,

03:56:21.680 --> 03:56:24.160
but that does not mean that's who they are.

03:56:24.160 --> 03:56:28.280
And yes, so trauma has completely destructive effects

03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:30.680
on family and relationships

03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:34.560
and correcting that has ripple effects.

03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:38.000
Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.

03:56:38.000 --> 03:56:41.960
Because the problem is we are so quick to tell people

03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:43.920
they're suffering from PTSD.

03:56:43.920 --> 03:56:45.640
We're so quick to give them drugs.

03:56:45.640 --> 03:56:48.200
We're so quick to kick them out of the military.

03:56:48.200 --> 03:56:50.160
We're so quick to let them be homeless on the street.

03:56:50.160 --> 03:56:52.160
We're so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.

03:56:52.160 --> 03:56:53.080
We're so quick.

03:56:53.080 --> 03:56:54.120
And then all of a sudden,

03:56:54.120 --> 03:56:55.720
when a politician goes,

03:56:55.720 --> 03:56:57.080
veteran suicide is an issue,

03:56:57.080 --> 03:56:58.640
that's when it's a problem.

03:56:58.640 --> 03:57:00.480
Well, if you prevent the problem from happening

03:57:00.480 --> 03:57:01.320
in the first place,

03:57:01.320 --> 03:57:02.600
or you give people the right funding

03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:04.040
and tools to do the job,

03:57:04.040 --> 03:57:05.480
you won't have this problem.

03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:10.160
Do you have advice for young people?

03:57:10.160 --> 03:57:12.160
Think high school students,

03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:15.720
maybe undergrads, college students,

03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:17.920
about career, life,

03:57:17.920 --> 03:57:20.920
how to live a life that you can be proud of.

03:57:20.920 --> 03:57:22.600
You've had one heck of a life.

03:57:25.440 --> 03:57:27.800
Some of them are really cheesy, but they're true.

03:57:28.800 --> 03:57:32.160
Live a life you can be proud of, number one.

03:57:32.160 --> 03:57:34.080
If you wake up every morning and you hate what you do,

03:57:34.080 --> 03:57:37.080
change the fucking station.

03:57:37.080 --> 03:57:40.920
Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.

03:57:40.920 --> 03:57:41.880
It's not worth it.

03:57:41.880 --> 03:57:45.360
It's not what you're on this planet for.

03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:46.800
You're worth more than that,

03:57:46.800 --> 03:57:49.720
than the monotony of waking up, going to work,

03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:52.040
hating your life, drinking yourself to sleep,

03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:53.680
and functioning.

03:57:53.680 --> 03:57:54.720
Do yourself a favor.

03:57:54.720 --> 03:57:57.360
The thing I scream about on the show so much is,

03:57:57.800 --> 03:58:00.280
move your fucking body.

03:58:00.280 --> 03:58:02.480
Move your body.

03:58:02.480 --> 03:58:04.160
Get your blood moving.

03:58:04.160 --> 03:58:07.360
Allow your body to do what it's here for.

03:58:07.360 --> 03:58:09.160
Go for a run, go for a walk.

03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:11.280
If you can't run, walk to the fridge

03:58:11.280 --> 03:58:13.560
three times more than maybe you did before,

03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:15.360
but you're moving.

03:58:15.360 --> 03:58:18.400
Pay attention to the shit you look at.

03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:23.120
More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation

03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:27.120
just be force-fed information from one side or the other,

03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:28.520
and none of it makes sense.

03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:29.760
None of it's understandable.

03:58:29.760 --> 03:58:32.440
It just causes chaos in the brain.

03:58:32.440 --> 03:58:36.480
Really pay attention to what you listen to.

03:58:36.480 --> 03:58:38.760
Something I've had to learn to do is,

03:58:39.680 --> 03:58:41.200
make time for myself.

03:58:42.120 --> 03:58:46.240
All of this working 18 hours a day, not sleeping,

03:58:46.240 --> 03:58:47.200
just work, work, work, work.

03:58:47.200 --> 03:58:48.040
That doesn't work.

03:58:48.040 --> 03:58:48.880
That's not sustainable.

03:58:48.880 --> 03:58:50.920
It's not healthy, and it's not anything

03:58:50.920 --> 03:58:52.160
anyone should be doing.

03:58:52.160 --> 03:58:53.760
Balance is important,

03:58:54.720 --> 03:58:57.760
but if you're going to take the time

03:58:57.760 --> 03:58:59.760
to do something for yourself,

03:58:59.760 --> 03:59:02.120
don't make it sitting in front of the TV for six hours,

03:59:02.120 --> 03:59:04.920
eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.

03:59:04.920 --> 03:59:06.840
Make it, I'm gonna go for a walk,

03:59:06.840 --> 03:59:09.640
maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.

03:59:09.640 --> 03:59:12.440
Make it, I'm gonna go volunteer somewhere.

03:59:12.440 --> 03:59:13.520
Nobody does that anymore,

03:59:13.520 --> 03:59:15.160
but make it I can go volunteer somewhere.

03:59:15.160 --> 03:59:18.080
Honor House, they have no paid employees.

03:59:18.080 --> 03:59:18.920
They have one.

03:59:18.920 --> 03:59:20.400
Everybody is a volunteer.

03:59:20.400 --> 03:59:22.920
They're fucking phenomenal.

03:59:23.000 --> 03:59:25.960
Just do whatever you're gonna do.

03:59:25.960 --> 03:59:27.840
Do it with some fucking drive.

03:59:27.840 --> 03:59:30.480
Put some goddamn effort into your life

03:59:30.480 --> 03:59:34.280
and pick something in a career that's gonna make you happy.

03:59:34.280 --> 03:59:36.240
Not something that's just gonna give you six figures

03:59:36.240 --> 03:59:37.440
because that's not gonna make you happy.

03:59:37.440 --> 03:59:40.400
I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world,

03:59:40.400 --> 03:59:42.360
and the last thing I want is more things.

03:59:42.360 --> 03:59:43.200
I want less.

03:59:43.200 --> 03:59:45.720
I want the woods, and I want quiet

03:59:45.720 --> 03:59:48.200
because that's what's important to me.

03:59:48.200 --> 03:59:50.440
I want my family to matter,

03:59:50.440 --> 03:59:52.120
the people around me to matter,

03:59:52.120 --> 03:59:55.840
and the small group I keep that tight knit I have.

03:59:55.840 --> 03:59:57.600
I want them to wake up every minute

03:59:57.600 --> 03:59:58.720
knowing that they have a friend

03:59:58.720 --> 03:59:59.920
that they can call on the other line

03:59:59.920 --> 04:00:01.840
that isn't just like, how's it going?

04:00:01.840 --> 04:00:04.280
That can actually have a conversation,

04:00:04.280 --> 04:00:08.600
a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.

04:00:09.480 --> 04:00:11.720
We are just breeding these kids

04:00:11.720 --> 04:00:14.880
to be followers who digest bullshit,

04:00:14.880 --> 04:00:18.160
who reverberate things they don't fully understand

04:00:18.160 --> 04:00:19.920
and have opinions on stuff

04:00:19.920 --> 04:00:21.720
they have no business talking about.

04:00:23.080 --> 04:00:25.920
Yeah, with an open mind, humbly,

04:00:25.920 --> 04:00:28.200
think deeply about the world.

04:00:28.200 --> 04:00:29.040
Correct.

04:00:29.040 --> 04:00:32.720
How has your relationship with death changed?

04:00:32.720 --> 04:00:36.040
This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.

04:00:36.040 --> 04:00:38.600
So you've considered suicide throughout your life.

04:00:38.600 --> 04:00:41.080
You have been in the line of fire.

04:00:41.080 --> 04:00:43.000
You have witnessed death.

04:00:43.000 --> 04:00:45.440
You as a human being, a mortal one,

04:00:46.680 --> 04:00:49.800
do you think about your death these days?

04:00:50.680 --> 04:00:52.440
Now that you have begun the journey

04:00:52.440 --> 04:00:55.320
with dealing with your trauma,

04:00:55.320 --> 04:00:57.880
do you think about your death?

04:00:57.880 --> 04:00:59.400
Are you afraid of your death?

04:01:01.320 --> 04:01:03.120
Well, you don't die, so that's why.

04:01:04.120 --> 04:01:05.320
What do you mean you don't die?

04:01:05.320 --> 04:01:06.880
You move on.

04:01:06.880 --> 04:01:08.640
Where do you go?

04:01:08.640 --> 04:01:10.920
To another plane and another vibration

04:01:10.920 --> 04:01:13.360
and another whatever you wanna call it.

04:01:13.360 --> 04:01:14.240
This isn't it.

04:01:14.240 --> 04:01:15.920
This isn't all of it.

04:01:15.920 --> 04:01:17.320
This is a blip.

04:01:17.320 --> 04:01:18.520
This is a moment.

04:01:18.520 --> 04:01:22.800
This is, I used to be afraid of death before the military.

04:01:22.800 --> 04:01:24.600
I was always afraid of dying.

04:01:24.600 --> 04:01:25.440
I don't know why.

04:01:25.440 --> 04:01:26.920
I had this irrational fear

04:01:26.920 --> 04:01:28.720
that I was gonna be kidnapped in my room.

04:01:28.720 --> 04:01:31.400
Like seriously, like irrational fear, like afraid.

04:01:32.680 --> 04:01:35.760
And it's funny, cause I talked to Michaela yesterday

04:01:35.760 --> 04:01:37.720
and she said the same thing and I was like,

04:01:37.720 --> 04:01:39.680
oh my God, I know what you're talking about.

04:01:39.680 --> 04:01:41.120
Being afraid of being kidnapped?

04:01:41.120 --> 04:01:43.440
Yeah, she had this like fear that someone was gonna come in

04:01:43.440 --> 04:01:44.840
and take her out of her room.

04:01:45.800 --> 04:01:46.920
I had the same fear.

04:01:46.920 --> 04:01:49.120
By a human being or a monster or some kind?

04:01:49.120 --> 04:01:50.440
No, I think like by a human being.

04:01:50.440 --> 04:01:52.120
And I had this irrational fear

04:01:52.120 --> 04:01:54.920
that something was gonna happen to me.

04:01:54.920 --> 04:01:56.240
And like I said, I don't know if it was because

04:01:56.240 --> 04:01:58.440
my parents were always made me aware of my surroundings.

04:01:58.440 --> 04:01:59.360
People take people.

04:01:59.360 --> 04:02:01.400
This is a real thing that happens.

04:02:01.400 --> 04:02:02.640
And I was really small.

04:02:02.640 --> 04:02:03.760
And I looked like a little boy.

04:02:03.760 --> 04:02:06.160
My hair was like that when I was training.

04:02:06.160 --> 04:02:07.280
I had short, no hair.

04:02:07.280 --> 04:02:08.680
I didn't have flat as a board.

04:02:08.680 --> 04:02:10.880
You would have thought I was a 12 year old boy.

04:02:10.880 --> 04:02:12.880
And so my mom's like, people take people, sweetie.

04:02:12.880 --> 04:02:14.800
That's just the reality of life.

04:02:14.800 --> 04:02:15.640
You need to be aware.

04:02:15.640 --> 04:02:18.120
I don't know if I had this ingrained in my mind.

04:02:18.120 --> 04:02:20.480
I was always like training to protect myself

04:02:20.480 --> 04:02:21.600
or fight someone off.

04:02:21.600 --> 04:02:25.240
So I was like afraid of like this irrational thing.

04:02:25.240 --> 04:02:27.360
And then I went overseas and then I realized

04:02:27.360 --> 04:02:28.520
that I could just be literally there

04:02:28.520 --> 04:02:29.720
talking to you, having a conversation

04:02:29.720 --> 04:02:32.120
and I could just be taken off the face of the earth.

04:02:32.120 --> 04:02:34.680
And there's nothing I can do about it.

04:02:34.680 --> 04:02:36.840
And then I adopted this idea that when it's my time

04:02:36.840 --> 04:02:40.080
it'll be my time, but the difference is now

04:02:41.080 --> 04:02:46.080
at least I know that if I do go and I do cross

04:02:49.120 --> 04:02:54.120
and I do move on, I know that I live my life

04:02:55.920 --> 04:02:59.920
the way that I always hoped I would be proud to live.

04:03:02.800 --> 04:03:04.560
Can I ask you a dark question?

04:03:04.560 --> 04:03:07.520
Because you mentioned Robin Williams.

04:03:07.520 --> 04:03:09.480
You mentioned Anthony Bourdain

04:03:09.480 --> 04:03:12.160
and your own struggle with suicide.

04:03:12.160 --> 04:03:17.160
Why do you think they ultimately lost that battle?

04:03:18.040 --> 04:03:19.360
Why do you think they lost their lives?

04:03:19.360 --> 04:03:21.640
Man, that's a loaded question

04:03:21.640 --> 04:03:25.920
because you can look at everything from biomarkers

04:03:25.920 --> 04:03:28.280
in the brain to know if their serotonin

04:03:28.280 --> 04:03:30.000
and dopamine levels were crashed in the ground.

04:03:30.000 --> 04:03:34.360
Like there's biological reasonings for some people

04:03:34.360 --> 04:03:36.400
where they're born bipolar and they have,

04:03:36.400 --> 04:03:37.400
or they're schizophrenic.

04:03:37.400 --> 04:03:42.400
There's so many things we don't fully grasp about the brain

04:03:43.680 --> 04:03:47.160
but what we do know from my perspective, for me at least

04:03:51.200 --> 04:03:54.160
there really is no rhyme or reason why I survived

04:03:54.160 --> 04:03:55.160
and others didn't.

04:03:56.520 --> 04:03:59.160
Stuff and things don't make you happy.

04:03:59.160 --> 04:04:03.240
People don't always know why they're feeling

04:04:03.240 --> 04:04:04.080
the way they're feeling

04:04:04.080 --> 04:04:09.080
but they also are not always willing to talk about it

04:04:10.800 --> 04:04:15.080
or be, they put on a good front

04:04:15.080 --> 04:04:18.320
and if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?

04:04:18.320 --> 04:04:21.240
And it's especially clear with the two of them

04:04:21.240 --> 04:04:25.040
that on the surface they're exceptionally successful

04:04:25.040 --> 04:04:28.760
in so many dimensions and still that means nothing.

04:04:28.760 --> 04:04:33.760
Material possessions, anything really is not,

04:04:33.840 --> 04:04:36.560
doesn't guarantee you happiness.

04:04:36.560 --> 04:04:37.640
No, it doesn't.

04:04:38.600 --> 04:04:40.040
Well. That's scary.

04:04:40.040 --> 04:04:44.840
That's terrifying but when it's good,

04:04:44.840 --> 04:04:49.000
that's what makes it joyful.

04:04:49.000 --> 04:04:50.960
Like that's what happiness is.

04:04:50.960 --> 04:04:54.560
It's like holy shit, somehow amidst all the absurdity,

04:04:54.560 --> 04:04:56.800
all the things that you can't predict,

04:04:56.800 --> 04:04:58.880
you nevertheless feel really good.

04:04:58.880 --> 04:05:01.840
That's why I feel really fortunate to be getting

04:05:01.840 --> 04:05:03.840
to this feed of happiness all the time.

04:05:04.880 --> 04:05:09.880
Well, to be or not to be, that's a good place to end it.

04:05:10.160 --> 04:05:13.280
Kelsey, you're an amazing human being.

04:05:13.280 --> 04:05:15.200
I'm really fortunate that you would spend

04:05:15.200 --> 04:05:16.560
your valuable time with me.

04:05:18.000 --> 04:05:23.000
As I said, you're so good at not just talking but listening

04:05:23.280 --> 04:05:25.880
so I definitely will listen to your podcast

04:05:25.880 --> 04:05:27.960
because I can tell you're an incredible person

04:05:27.960 --> 04:05:30.880
as an interviewer and as a storyteller.

04:05:30.880 --> 04:05:33.600
So again, thank you for talking today.

04:05:33.600 --> 04:05:34.520
Thank you so much.

04:05:36.520 --> 04:05:37.960
Thanks for listening to this conversation

04:05:37.960 --> 04:05:39.280
with Kelsey Sharon.

04:05:45.320 --> 04:05:46.560
from Herbert Hoover.

04:05:47.440 --> 04:05:51.360
Older men declare war but it is the youth

04:05:51.360 --> 04:05:53.200
that must fight and die.

04:05:54.480 --> 04:05:57.320
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

04:06:00.880 --> 04:06:01.720
Thank you.
