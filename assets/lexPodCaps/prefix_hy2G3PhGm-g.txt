00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
If one site is hacked, you can just unleash all hell.

00:03.520 --> 00:06.800
We have stumbled into this new era

00:06.800 --> 00:08.960
of mutually assured digital destruction.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.200
How far are people willing to go?

00:11.200 --> 00:13.040
You can capture their location,

00:13.040 --> 00:16.160
you can capture their contacts

00:16.160 --> 00:18.000
that record their telephone calls,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.760
record their camera without them knowing about it.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.400
Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet

00:24.400 --> 00:25.960
on someone without them knowing.

00:26.040 --> 00:31.040
You could sell that to a zero-day broker for $2 million.

00:34.280 --> 00:37.360
The following is a conversation with Nicole Perlroth,

00:37.360 --> 00:40.120
cybersecurity journalist and author

00:40.120 --> 00:42.560
of This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,

00:42.560 --> 00:44.920
The Cyber Weapons Arm Race.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.960
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.100
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:49.100 --> 00:50.360
in the description.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.320
And now, dear friends, here's Nicole Perlroth.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.600
You've interviewed hundreds of cybersecurity hackers,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.040
activists, dissidents, computer scientists,

01:01.040 --> 01:03.760
government officials, forensic investigators,

01:03.760 --> 01:05.720
and mercenaries.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.440
So let's talk about cybersecurity and cyber war.

01:09.440 --> 01:10.520
Start with the basics.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.560
What is a zero-day vulnerability

01:13.560 --> 01:16.840
and then a zero-day exploit or attack?

01:18.080 --> 01:20.880
So at the most basic level,

01:20.880 --> 01:24.680
let's say I'm a hacker and I find a bug

01:24.680 --> 01:29.680
in your iPhone iOS software that no one else knows about,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.680
especially Apple, that's called a zero-day

01:32.680 --> 01:34.320
because the minute it's discovered,

01:34.320 --> 01:36.520
engineers have had zero days to fix it.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.880
If I can study that zero-day,

01:40.880 --> 01:44.880
I could potentially write a program to exploit it.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.800
And that program would be called a zero-day exploit.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.840
And for iOS, the dream is that you craft a zero-day exploit

01:54.280 --> 01:57.360
that can remotely exploit someone else's iPhone

01:57.360 --> 01:59.920
without them ever knowing about it.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.860
And you can capture their location,

02:01.860 --> 02:04.960
you can capture their contacts

02:04.960 --> 02:06.840
that record their telephone calls,

02:06.840 --> 02:09.580
record their camera without them knowing about it.

02:09.580 --> 02:13.200
Basically, you can put an invisible ankle bracelet

02:13.200 --> 02:15.000
on someone without them knowing.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.160
And you can see why that capability,

02:17.160 --> 02:20.480
that zero-day exploit would have immense value

02:20.480 --> 02:23.720
for a spy agency or a government

02:23.720 --> 02:27.640
that wants to monitor its critics or dissidents.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.560
And so there's a very lucrative market now

02:30.560 --> 02:32.080
for zero-day exploits.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.400
So you said a few things there.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.320
One is iOS, why iOS?

02:36.320 --> 02:37.640
Which operating system?

02:37.640 --> 02:40.160
Which one is the sexier thing to try to get to

02:40.160 --> 02:42.680
or the most impactful thing?

02:42.680 --> 02:45.440
And the other thing you mentioned is remote

02:45.440 --> 02:49.240
versus having to actually come in physical contact with it.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.840
Is that the distinction?

02:50.840 --> 02:54.480
So iPhone exploits have just been

02:54.480 --> 02:58.200
a government's number one priority.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.040
Recently, actually, the price of an Android

03:02.040 --> 03:03.480
remote zero-day exploit,

03:03.480 --> 03:06.520
something that can get you into Android phones,

03:06.520 --> 03:08.080
is actually higher.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.920
The value of that is now higher on this underground market

03:10.920 --> 03:15.320
for zero-day exploits than an iPhone iOS exploit.

03:15.360 --> 03:16.680
So things are changing.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.040
So there's probably more Android devices,

03:20.040 --> 03:21.720
so that's why it's better.

03:21.720 --> 03:26.160
But then the iPhone side, so I'm an Android person

03:26.160 --> 03:28.400
because I'm a man of the people.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.120
But it seems like all the elites use iPhone,

03:31.120 --> 03:33.000
all the people at nice dinner parties.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.120
So is that the reason that the more powerful people use iPhones?

03:38.120 --> 03:38.960
Is that why?

03:38.960 --> 03:39.800
I don't think so.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.440
I actually, so it was about two years ago

03:42.440 --> 03:43.640
that the price has flipped.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.720
It used to be that if you could craft

03:46.720 --> 03:51.720
a remote zero-click exploit for iOS,

03:53.280 --> 03:55.400
then that was about as good as it gets.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.400
You could sell that to a zero-day broker for $2 million.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.680
The caveat is you can never tell anyone about it

04:04.680 --> 04:07.160
because the minute you tell someone about it,

04:07.160 --> 04:09.680
Apple learns about it, they patch it,

04:09.680 --> 04:12.520
and that $2.5 million investment

04:12.520 --> 04:16.080
that that zero-day broker just made goes to dust.

04:16.080 --> 04:20.760
So a couple years ago, and don't quote me on the prices,

04:20.760 --> 04:25.760
but an Android zero-click remote exploit

04:25.880 --> 04:29.000
for the first time topped the iOS.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.160
And actually a lot of people's read on that

04:32.160 --> 04:37.160
was that it might be a sign that Apple's security

04:38.160 --> 04:42.920
was falling and that it might actually be easier

04:42.920 --> 04:46.560
to find an iOS zero-day exploit

04:46.560 --> 04:48.760
than find an Android zero-day exploit.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.000
The other thing is market share.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.720
There are just more people around the world

04:52.720 --> 04:54.560
that use Android.

04:54.560 --> 04:58.400
And a lot of governments that are paying top dollar

04:58.400 --> 05:01.200
for zero-day exploits these days

05:01.200 --> 05:05.120
are deep-pocketed governments in the Gulf

05:05.240 --> 05:06.880
that want to use these exploits

05:06.880 --> 05:10.760
to monitor their own citizens, monitor their critics.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.360
And so it's not necessarily

05:12.360 --> 05:14.600
that they're trying to find elites.

05:14.600 --> 05:17.240
It's that they want to find out who these people are

05:17.240 --> 05:18.480
that are criticizing them

05:18.480 --> 05:21.160
or perhaps planning the next Arab Spring.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.920
So in your experience, are most of these attacks targeted

05:24.920 --> 05:28.480
to cover a large population or is there attacks

05:28.480 --> 05:31.320
that are targeted towards specific individuals?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.720
So I think it's both.

05:32.760 --> 05:37.000
Some of the zero-day exploits that have fetched top dollar

05:37.000 --> 05:39.360
that I've heard of in my reporting in the United States

05:39.360 --> 05:41.280
were highly targeted.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.640
There was a potential terrorist attack.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.480
They wanted to get into this person's phone.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.080
It had to be done in the next 24 hours.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.400
They approached hackers and say,

05:49.400 --> 05:53.760
we'll pay you X millions of dollars if you can do this.

05:53.760 --> 05:57.440
But then you look at when we've discovered

05:57.440 --> 06:00.760
iOS zero-day exploits in the wild,

06:00.760 --> 06:02.400
some of them have been targeting

06:02.400 --> 06:05.280
large populations like Uighurs.

06:05.280 --> 06:10.280
So a couple of years ago, there was a watering hole attack.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.200
Okay, what's a watering hole attack?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.280
There's a website.

06:13.280 --> 06:17.920
It was actually had information aimed at Uighurs

06:17.920 --> 06:21.000
and you could access it all over the world.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.300
And if you visited this website,

06:24.200 --> 06:29.200
it would drop an iOS zero-day exploit onto your phone.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.240
And so anyone that visited this website

06:32.240 --> 06:34.480
that was about Uighurs anywhere,

06:34.480 --> 06:37.400
I mean, Uighurs, Uighurs living abroad,

06:37.400 --> 06:42.040
basically the Uighur diaspora would have gotten infected

06:42.040 --> 06:43.960
with this zero-day exploit.

06:43.960 --> 06:48.960
So in that case, they were targeting huge swaths

06:49.200 --> 06:51.720
of this one population or people interested

06:51.720 --> 06:54.760
in this one population basically in real time.

06:55.660 --> 06:59.360
Who are these attackers?

06:59.360 --> 07:02.680
From the individual level to the group level,

07:02.680 --> 07:05.200
psychologically speaking, what's their motivation?

07:05.200 --> 07:07.440
Is it purely money?

07:07.440 --> 07:09.240
Is it the challenge?

07:09.240 --> 07:10.600
Are they malevolent?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.240
Is it power?

07:12.240 --> 07:15.440
These are big philosophical human questions, I guess.

07:15.440 --> 07:20.360
So these are the questions I set out to answer for my book.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.080
I wanted to know,

07:23.240 --> 07:25.640
are these people that are just after money?

07:26.920 --> 07:29.680
If they're just after money, how do they sleep at night?

07:29.680 --> 07:31.900
Not knowing whether that zero-day exploit

07:31.900 --> 07:34.720
they just sold to a broker is being used

07:34.720 --> 07:37.280
to basically make someone's life a living hell.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.840
And what I found was there's kind of this long sorted history

07:41.840 --> 07:43.640
to this question.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.920
It started out in the 80s and 90s

07:46.920 --> 07:51.200
when hackers were just finding holes and bugs in software

07:51.200 --> 07:54.360
for curiosity's sake, really as a hobby.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.840
And some of them would go to the tech companies

07:56.840 --> 08:01.760
like Microsoft or Sun Microsystems at the time or Oracle.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.520
And they'd say, hey, I just found this zero-day

08:04.520 --> 08:08.160
in your software and I can use it to break into NASA.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.200
And the general response at the time wasn't,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.960
thank you so much for pointing out this flaw

08:14.000 --> 08:17.280
and our software, we'll get it fixed as soon as possible.

08:17.280 --> 08:21.240
It was, don't ever poke around our software ever again

08:21.240 --> 08:24.200
or we'll stick our general counsel on you.

08:24.200 --> 08:29.200
And that was really sort of the common thread for years.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.460
And so hackers who set out to do the right thing

08:34.460 --> 08:37.680
were basically told to shut up

08:37.680 --> 08:40.160
and stop doing what you're doing.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.280
And what happened next was

08:43.480 --> 08:46.280
they basically started trading this information online.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.200
Now, when you go back and interview people

08:48.200 --> 08:53.080
from those early days, they all tell a very similar story,

08:53.080 --> 08:57.560
which is they're curious, they're tinkers.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.800
They remind me of like the kid down the block

08:59.800 --> 09:03.840
that was constantly poking around the hood of his dad's car.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.180
They just couldn't help themselves.

09:06.180 --> 09:09.520
They wanted to figure out how a system is designed

09:09.600 --> 09:11.880
and how they could potentially exploit it

09:11.880 --> 09:13.080
for some other purpose.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.920
It doesn't have to be good or bad.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.640
But they were basically kind of beat down for so long

09:20.640 --> 09:22.940
by these big tech companies

09:22.940 --> 09:26.600
that they started just silently trading them

09:26.600 --> 09:28.080
with other hackers.

09:28.080 --> 09:32.640
And that's how you got these really heated debates

09:32.640 --> 09:34.780
in the 90s about disclosure.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.160
Should you just dump these things online

09:38.160 --> 09:40.320
because any script kitty can pick them up

09:40.320 --> 09:42.560
and use it for all kinds of mischief.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.100
But don't you wanna just stick a middle finger

09:46.100 --> 09:47.280
to all these companies

09:47.280 --> 09:50.020
that are basically threatening you all the time.

09:50.020 --> 09:53.600
So there was this really interesting dynamic at play.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.060
And what I learned in the course of doing my book

09:57.060 --> 10:01.680
was that government agencies and their contractors

10:01.680 --> 10:06.160
sort of tapped into that frustration and that resentment.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.120
And they started quietly reaching out to hackers

10:09.120 --> 10:11.080
on these forums.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.800
And they said, hey, you know that zero day

10:13.800 --> 10:14.880
you just dropped online.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.920
Could you come up with something custom for me

10:17.920 --> 10:20.040
and I'll pay you six figures for it

10:20.040 --> 10:22.680
so long as you shut up and never tell anyone

10:22.680 --> 10:24.720
that I paid you for this.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.000
And that's what happened.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.400
So throughout the 90s,

10:28.400 --> 10:31.400
there was a bunch of boutique contractors

10:31.400 --> 10:34.640
that started reaching out to hackers on these forums

10:34.640 --> 10:37.960
and saying, hey, I'll pay you six figures for that bug

10:37.960 --> 10:41.400
you were trying to get Microsoft to fix for free.

10:41.400 --> 10:45.520
And sort of so began or so catalyzed this market

10:45.520 --> 10:48.000
where governments and their intermediaries

10:48.000 --> 10:50.400
started reaching out to these hackers

10:50.400 --> 10:52.600
and buying their bugs for free.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.160
And in those early days,

10:54.160 --> 10:57.600
I think a lot of it was just for quiet counterintelligence,

10:57.600 --> 11:00.000
traditional espionage.

11:00.040 --> 11:04.240
But as we started baking the software,

11:04.240 --> 11:07.040
Windows software, Schneider Electric,

11:07.040 --> 11:11.280
Siemens Industrial Software into our nuclear plants

11:11.280 --> 11:14.920
and our factories and our power grid

11:14.920 --> 11:18.720
and our petrochemical facilities and our pipelines,

11:18.720 --> 11:22.080
those same zero days came to be just as valuable

11:22.080 --> 11:25.120
for sabotage and war planning.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.200
Does the fact that the market sprung up

11:27.200 --> 11:28.480
and you cannot make a lot of money

11:28.480 --> 11:30.000
change the nature of the attackers

11:30.000 --> 11:34.520
that came to the table or grow the number of attackers?

11:34.520 --> 11:36.920
I mean, what is, I guess you told the psychology

11:36.920 --> 11:40.560
of the hackers in the 90s,

11:40.560 --> 11:44.000
what is the culture today and where is it heading?

11:44.000 --> 11:47.120
So I think there are people who will tell you

11:47.120 --> 11:49.080
they would never sell a zero day

11:49.080 --> 11:52.080
to a zero day broker or a government.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.560
One, because they don't know how it's gonna get used

11:54.560 --> 11:56.360
when they throw it over the fence.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.800
Most of these get rolled into classified programs

11:58.800 --> 12:01.280
and you don't know how they get used.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.680
If you sell it to a zero day broker,

12:02.680 --> 12:05.480
you don't even know which nation state might use it

12:06.880 --> 12:09.280
or potentially which criminal group might use it

12:09.280 --> 12:11.360
if you sell it on the dark web.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.960
The other thing that they say

12:12.960 --> 12:16.920
is that they wanna be able to sleep at night.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.880
And they lose a lot of sleep

12:19.880 --> 12:22.120
if they found out their zero day was being used

12:22.120 --> 12:24.800
to make a dissident's life living hell.

12:25.640 --> 12:28.480
But there are a lot of people, good people,

12:28.480 --> 12:32.560
who also say, no, this is not my problem.

12:32.560 --> 12:35.360
This is the technology company's problem.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.000
If they weren't writing new bugs

12:37.000 --> 12:39.120
into their software every day,

12:39.120 --> 12:41.000
then there wouldn't be a market.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.800
Then there wouldn't be a problem.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.760
But they continue to write bugs

12:44.760 --> 12:46.160
into their software all the time

12:46.160 --> 12:48.240
and they continue to profit off that software.

12:48.240 --> 12:53.240
So why shouldn't I profit off my labor too?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.680
And one of the things that has happened,

12:55.680 --> 12:57.920
which is I think a positive development

12:57.920 --> 13:02.200
over the last 10 years, are bug bounty programs.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.000
Companies like Google and Facebook

13:05.000 --> 13:07.400
and then Microsoft and finally Apple,

13:07.400 --> 13:10.120
which resisted it for a really long time,

13:10.120 --> 13:14.760
have said, okay, we are gonna shift our perspective

13:14.760 --> 13:15.680
about hackers.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.920
We're no longer going to treat them as the enemy here.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.320
We're going to start paying them

13:20.320 --> 13:23.760
for what it's essentially free quality assurance.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.760
And we're gonna pay them good money in some cases,

13:26.760 --> 13:28.880
six figures in some cases.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.360
We're never gonna be able to bid against a zero day broker

13:32.360 --> 13:34.720
who sells to government agencies,

13:34.720 --> 13:38.880
but we can reward them and hopefully get to that bug earlier

13:38.880 --> 13:40.960
where we can neutralize it

13:40.960 --> 13:43.020
so that they don't have to spend another year

13:43.020 --> 13:44.720
developing the zero day exploit.

13:44.720 --> 13:48.160
And in that way, we can keep our software more secure.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.680
But every week I get messages from some hacker

13:51.680 --> 13:55.920
that says, I tried to see this zero day exploit

13:55.920 --> 13:58.000
that was just found in the wild,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.320
being used by this nation state.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.520
I tried to tell Microsoft about this two years ago

14:04.520 --> 14:08.840
and they were gonna pay me peanuts, so it never got fixed.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.640
There are all sorts of those stories that can continue on.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.680
And I think just generally,

14:16.720 --> 14:19.840
hackers are not very good at diplomacy.

14:19.840 --> 14:24.520
They tend to be pretty snipey, technical crowd

14:25.560 --> 14:28.240
and very philosophical in my experience,

14:28.240 --> 14:31.880
but diplomacy is not their strong suit.

14:31.880 --> 14:33.720
Oh, there almost has to be a broker

14:33.720 --> 14:35.960
between companies and hackers

14:35.960 --> 14:38.000
where you can translate effectively,

14:38.000 --> 14:39.560
just like you have a zero day broker

14:39.560 --> 14:41.200
between governments and hackers.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.040
Yeah.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.160
Because you have to speak their language.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.920
Yeah, and there have been some of those companies

14:45.920 --> 14:47.800
who've risen up to meet that demand

14:47.800 --> 14:50.360
and Hacker One is one of them.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.480
Bug Crowd is another.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.320
Synac has an interesting model.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.920
So that's a company that you pay

14:56.920 --> 14:59.920
for a private bug bounty program, essentially.

14:59.920 --> 15:00.960
So you pay this company,

15:00.960 --> 15:04.480
they tap hackers all over the world

15:04.480 --> 15:07.640
to come hack your software, hack your system.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.880
And then they'll quietly tell you what they found.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.800
And I think that's a really positive development.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.320
And actually the Department of Defense

15:16.320 --> 15:20.480
hired all three of those companies I just mentioned

15:20.480 --> 15:22.000
to help secure their systems.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.160
Now I think they're still a little timid

15:24.160 --> 15:25.800
in terms of letting those hackers

15:25.800 --> 15:30.320
into the really sensitive high side classified stuff,

15:30.320 --> 15:32.080
but you know, baby steps.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.720
Just to understand what you were saying,

15:34.720 --> 15:37.760
you think it's impossible for companies

15:37.760 --> 15:40.520
to financially compete with the zero day brokers

15:40.520 --> 15:42.000
with governments.

15:42.040 --> 15:47.040
So like the defense can't outpay the hackers?

15:47.760 --> 15:51.880
It's interesting, you know, they shouldn't outpay them

15:51.880 --> 15:56.160
because what would happen if they started offering

15:56.160 --> 16:01.160
$2.5 million at Apple for any zero day exploit

16:02.320 --> 16:04.720
that governments would pay that much for

16:04.720 --> 16:06.280
is their own engineers would say,

16:06.280 --> 16:10.280
why the hell am I working for less than that

16:10.280 --> 16:12.400
and doing my nine to five every day?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.680
So you would create a perverse incentive.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.480
And I didn't think about that until I started this research

16:18.480 --> 16:20.480
and I realized, okay, yeah, that makes sense.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.280
You don't want to incentivize offense so much

16:25.280 --> 16:27.240
that it's to your own detriment.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.520
And so I think what they have though,

16:29.520 --> 16:32.640
what the companies have on government agencies

16:32.640 --> 16:36.120
is if they pay you, you get to talk about it.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.120
You know, you get the street cred,

16:38.120 --> 16:41.240
you get to brag about the fact you just found

16:41.240 --> 16:45.280
that $2.5 million, you know, iOS zero day

16:45.280 --> 16:47.040
that no one else did.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.760
And if you sell it to a broker,

16:48.760 --> 16:50.080
you never get to talk about it.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.280
And I think that really does eat at people.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.080
Can I ask you a big philosophical question

16:55.080 --> 16:56.440
about human nature here?

16:57.280 --> 17:00.760
So if you have, I mean, what you've seen,

17:00.760 --> 17:03.400
if a human being has a zero day,

17:03.400 --> 17:06.400
they found a zero day vulnerability

17:06.440 --> 17:09.880
that can hack into, I don't know,

17:09.880 --> 17:12.000
what's the worst thing you can hack into?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.920
Something that could launch nuclear weapons.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.040
Which percentage of the people in the world

17:17.040 --> 17:20.680
that have the skill would not share that with anyone,

17:20.680 --> 17:23.480
with any bad party?

17:23.480 --> 17:27.800
I guess how many people are completely devoid

17:27.800 --> 17:31.800
of ethical concerns in your sense.

17:31.800 --> 17:36.400
So my belief is all the ultra competent people

17:36.400 --> 17:39.600
or very, very high percentage of ultra competent people

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
are also ethical people.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.000
That's been my experience.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.880
But then again, my experience is narrow.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.560
What's your experience been like?

17:48.560 --> 17:52.720
So this was another question I wanted to answer.

17:52.720 --> 17:56.560
You know, who are these people who would sell

17:56.560 --> 17:59.560
a zero day exploit that would neutralize

17:59.560 --> 18:03.120
a Schneider electric safety lock at a petrochemical plant?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.400
Basically the last thing you would need to neutralize

18:05.400 --> 18:08.000
before you trigger some kind of explosion.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.160
Who would sell that?

18:11.360 --> 18:14.160
And I got my answer.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.840
Well, the answer was different.

18:16.840 --> 18:19.880
A lot of people said, I would never even look there

18:19.880 --> 18:21.080
because I don't even want to know.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.040
I don't even want to have that capability.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.600
I don't like, I don't even want to have to make that decision

18:26.600 --> 18:29.960
about whether I'm going to profit off of that knowledge.

18:29.960 --> 18:34.960
I went down to Argentina and this whole kind of moral calculus

18:36.000 --> 18:39.280
I had in my head was completely flipped around.

18:39.280 --> 18:41.640
So just to back up for a moment.

18:41.640 --> 18:46.480
So Argentina actually is a real hacker's paradise.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.840
People grew up in Argentina and you know, I went down there.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.280
I guess I was there around 2015, 2016

18:54.280 --> 18:57.080
but you still couldn't get an iPhone.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.960
You know, they didn't have Amazon Prime.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.880
You couldn't get access to any of the apps

19:00.880 --> 19:02.640
we all take for granted.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.320
To get those things in Argentina as a kid,

19:05.320 --> 19:07.240
you have to find a way to hack them.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.640
You know, and it's the whole culture

19:09.640 --> 19:12.080
is really like a hacker culture.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.000
They say like, it's really like a MacGyver culture.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.960
You know, you have to figure out how to break

19:16.960 --> 19:19.520
into something with wire and tape.

19:19.520 --> 19:24.440
And that means that there are a lot of really good hackers

19:24.440 --> 19:29.440
in Argentina who specialize in developing zero-day exploits.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.040
And I went down to this Argentina conference

19:34.040 --> 19:38.240
called Echo Party and I asked the organizer,

19:38.240 --> 19:40.080
okay, can you introduce me to someone

19:40.080 --> 19:43.120
who's selling zero-day exploits to governments?

19:43.120 --> 19:45.040
And he was like, just throw a stone.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.960
Throw a stone anywhere and you're gonna hit someone.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.680
And all over this conference,

19:50.680 --> 19:53.080
you saw these guys who were clearly

19:53.080 --> 19:55.520
from these Gulf States who only spoke Arabic.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.360
You know, what are they doing

19:57.360 --> 20:01.160
at a young hacking conference in Buenos Aires?

20:01.160 --> 20:05.200
And so I went out to lunch with kind of this godfather

20:05.200 --> 20:07.360
of the hacking scene there.

20:07.360 --> 20:10.240
And I asked this really dumb question

20:10.240 --> 20:13.160
and I'm still embarrassed about how I phrased it.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.600
But I said, so, you know, will these guys only sell

20:16.640 --> 20:20.400
these zero-day exploits to good Western governments?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.400
And he said, Nicole, last time I checked,

20:22.400 --> 20:25.680
the United States wasn't a good Western government.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.280
You know, the last country that bombed another country

20:28.280 --> 20:31.920
into oblivion wasn't China or Iran.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.640
It was the United States.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.440
So if we're gonna go by your whole moral calculus,

20:36.440 --> 20:37.560
you know, just know that we have

20:37.560 --> 20:39.640
a very different calculus down here.

20:39.640 --> 20:44.280
And we'd actually rather sell to Iran or Russia

20:44.280 --> 20:46.680
or China maybe than the United States.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.880
And that just blew me away.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.160
Like, wow, you know, he's like,

20:51.160 --> 20:52.840
we'll just sell to whoever brings us

20:52.840 --> 20:53.920
the biggest bag of cash.

20:53.920 --> 20:57.960
Have you checked into our inflation situation recently?

20:57.960 --> 21:00.000
So, you know, I had some of those

21:00.000 --> 21:02.280
like reality checks along the way.

21:02.280 --> 21:04.520
You know, we tend to think of things as,

21:04.520 --> 21:07.000
is this moral, you know, is this ethical,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
especially as journalists?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.000
You know, we kind of sit on our high horse sometimes

21:11.000 --> 21:13.640
and write about a lot of things

21:13.640 --> 21:16.320
that seem to push the moral bounds.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.800
But in this market,

21:17.800 --> 21:20.160
which is essentially an underground market,

21:20.160 --> 21:22.400
that, you know, the one rule is like fight club.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.360
You know, no one talks about fight club.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.880
First rule of the zero day market,

21:25.880 --> 21:29.160
nobody talks about the zero day market on both sides

21:29.160 --> 21:30.840
because the hacker doesn't wanna lose

21:30.840 --> 21:33.920
their $2.5 million bounty.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.840
And governments roll these into classified programs

21:36.840 --> 21:39.160
and they don't want anyone to know what they have.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.200
So no one talks about this thing.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.840
And when you're operating in the dark like that,

21:43.840 --> 21:47.000
it's really easy to put aside your morals sometimes.

21:48.520 --> 21:52.080
Can I, as a small tangent, ask you by way of advice,

21:52.080 --> 21:55.560
you must have done some incredible interviews.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.360
And you've also spoken about

21:57.360 --> 22:00.080
how serious you take protecting your sources.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.440
If you were to give me advice for interviewing

22:04.440 --> 22:08.000
when you're recording on mic with a video camera,

22:08.600 --> 22:11.600
how is it possible to get into this world?

22:11.600 --> 22:14.640
Like, is it basically impossible?

22:14.640 --> 22:17.600
So you've spoken with a few people.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.800
What is it, like the godfather of cyber war, cyber security?

22:21.800 --> 22:23.840
So people that are already out.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.960
And they still have to be pretty brave to speak publicly.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.280
But is it virtually impossible to really talk to anybody

22:31.280 --> 22:33.280
who is a current hacker?

22:33.280 --> 22:36.200
You're always like 10, 20 years behind?

22:37.120 --> 22:38.240
It's a good question.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.280
And this is why I'm a print journalist.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.360
But when I've seen people do it,

22:45.360 --> 22:48.720
it's always the guy who's behind the shadows,

22:48.720 --> 22:51.000
whose voice has been altered.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.880
When they've gotten someone on camera,

22:52.880 --> 22:54.560
that's usually how they do it.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.400
Very, very few people talk in this space.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.520
And there's actually a pretty well-known case study

23:01.520 --> 23:03.880
in why you don't talk publicly in this space

23:03.880 --> 23:05.440
and you don't get photographed.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.920
And that's the GRUC.

23:06.920 --> 23:11.560
So the GRUC is or was this zero-day broker,

23:11.560 --> 23:14.760
South African guy, lives in Thailand.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.400
And right when I was starting on this subject

23:18.400 --> 23:22.200
at the New York Times, he'd given an interview to Forbes.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.080
And he talked about being a zero-day broker.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.680
And he even posed next to this giant devil bag

23:28.680 --> 23:31.280
filled with cash, ostensibly.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.000
And later he would say he was speaking off the record,

23:35.440 --> 23:38.000
he didn't understand the rules of the game.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
But what I heard from people who did business with him

23:41.000 --> 23:43.080
was that the minute that that story came out,

23:43.080 --> 23:45.280
he became PNG'd.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.560
No one did business with him.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.080
His business plummeted by at least half.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.120
No one wants to do business with anyone

23:52.120 --> 23:53.800
who's gonna get on camera

23:53.800 --> 23:56.800
and talk about how they're selling zero days to governments.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.720
It puts you at danger.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.640
And I did hear that he got some visits

24:01.640 --> 24:04.000
from some security folks.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.920
And that's another thing for these people to consider.

24:06.920 --> 24:11.920
If they have those zero-day exploits at their disposal,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.880
they become a huge target

24:14.880 --> 24:18.480
for nation states all over the world.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.800
Talk about having perfect OPSEC.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.520
You better have some perfect OPSEC

24:23.520 --> 24:25.520
if people know that you have access

24:25.520 --> 24:27.840
to those zero-day exploits.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.840
Which sucks because, I mean, transparency here

24:33.440 --> 24:36.360
would be really powerful for educating the world

24:36.360 --> 24:40.080
and also inspiring other engineers to do good.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.480
It just feels like when you operate in the shadows,

24:43.760 --> 24:46.320
it doesn't help us move in the positive direction

24:46.320 --> 24:48.880
in terms of getting more people on the defense side

24:48.880 --> 24:50.640
versus on the attack side.

24:50.640 --> 24:52.000
But of course, what can you do?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.600
I mean, the best you can possibly do

24:53.600 --> 24:55.120
is have great journalists,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.880
just like you did, interview and write books about it,

24:58.880 --> 25:01.000
and integrate the information you get

25:01.160 --> 25:02.920
while hiding the sources.

25:02.920 --> 25:07.600
Yeah, and I think what HackerOne has told me was,

25:07.600 --> 25:10.760
okay, let's just put away the people that are finding

25:10.760 --> 25:14.000
and developing zero-day exploits all day long.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.520
Let's put that aside.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.600
What about the however many millions of programmers

25:19.600 --> 25:21.720
all over the world who've never even heard

25:21.720 --> 25:23.280
of a zero-day exploit?

25:23.280 --> 25:26.040
Why not tap into them and say,

25:26.040 --> 25:29.240
hey, we'll start paying you if you can find a bug

25:29.240 --> 25:34.120
in United Airlines software or in Schneider Electric

25:34.120 --> 25:36.840
or in Ford or Tesla?

25:36.840 --> 25:39.920
And I think that is a really smart approach.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.920
Let's go find this untapped army of programmers

25:43.920 --> 25:46.880
to neutralize these bugs before the people

25:46.880 --> 25:49.120
who will continue to sell these to governments

25:49.120 --> 25:50.800
can find them and exploit them.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.000
Okay, I have to ask you about this from a personal side.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.600
It's funny enough, after we agreed to talk,

25:58.640 --> 26:01.160
I've gotten, for the first time in my life

26:01.160 --> 26:03.920
was a victim of a cyber attack.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.600
So this is ransomware, it's called Deadbolt.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.080
People can look it up.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.080
I have a QNAP device for basically kind of coldish storage.

26:15.600 --> 26:20.280
So it's about 60 terabytes with 50 terabytes of data on it

26:20.280 --> 26:25.280
in RAID 5 and apparently about four to 5,000 QNAP devices

26:26.280 --> 26:30.640
were hacked and taken over with this ransomware.

26:30.640 --> 26:35.520
And what ransomware does there is it goes file by file,

26:35.520 --> 26:38.840
almost all the files on the QNAP storage device

26:38.840 --> 26:40.360
and encrypts them.

26:40.360 --> 26:43.000
And then there's this very eloquently

26:43.000 --> 26:45.240
and politely written page that pops up.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.280
You know, it describes what happened.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.040
All your files have been encrypted.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.120
This includes, but is not limited to photos,

26:52.120 --> 26:53.800
documents, and spreadsheets.

26:53.800 --> 26:54.680
Why me?

26:56.160 --> 26:59.320
This is, a lot of people commented about how friendly

26:59.320 --> 27:01.800
and eloquent this is, and I have to commend them.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.040
It is, and it's pretty user-friendly.

27:06.000 --> 27:06.840
Why me?

27:06.840 --> 27:08.080
This is not a personal attack.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.040
You have been targeted because of the inadequate security

27:11.040 --> 27:13.560
provided by your vendor, QNAP.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.320
What now?

27:16.320 --> 27:19.800
You can make a payment of exactly .03 Bitcoin,

27:19.800 --> 27:23.360
which is about $1,000, to the following address.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.880
Once the payment has been made,

27:24.880 --> 27:27.560
we'll follow up with transaction to the same address,

27:27.560 --> 27:28.600
blah, blah, blah.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.520
They give you instructions of what happens next,

27:31.520 --> 27:34.600
and they'll give you a decryption key that you can then use.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.600
And then there's another message for QNAP that says,

27:38.800 --> 27:40.920
all your affected customers have been targeted

27:40.920 --> 27:43.840
using a zero-day vulnerability in your product.

27:43.840 --> 27:48.400
We offer you two options to mitigate this and future damage.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.760
One, make a Bitcoin payment of five Bitcoin

27:51.760 --> 27:56.320
to the following address, and that will reveal to QNAP the,

27:56.320 --> 28:00.160
I'm summarizing things here, what the actual vulnerability is,

28:00.160 --> 28:03.880
or you can make a Bitcoin payment of 50 Bitcoin

28:03.880 --> 28:07.040
to get a master decryption key for all your customers.

28:07.040 --> 28:10.360
50 Bitcoin is about $1.8 million.

28:10.360 --> 28:14.520
Okay, so first of all, on a personal level,

28:14.520 --> 28:16.320
this one hurt for me.

28:18.160 --> 28:21.120
There's, I mean, I learned a lot,

28:21.160 --> 28:23.840
because I wasn't, for the most part,

28:23.840 --> 28:27.080
backing up much of that data,

28:27.080 --> 28:30.960
because I thought I can afford to lose that data.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.480
It's not like horrible.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.960
I mean, I think you've spoken about the crown jewels,

28:35.960 --> 28:38.400
like making sure there's things you really protect,

28:38.400 --> 28:42.360
and I have, you know, I'm very conscious,

28:42.360 --> 28:45.120
security-wise, on the crown jewels.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.120
But there's a bunch of stuff, like, you know,

28:48.120 --> 28:49.920
personal videos, they're not like,

28:49.920 --> 28:51.920
I don't have anything creepy, but just like,

28:51.920 --> 28:54.800
fun things I did that, because they're very large,

28:54.800 --> 28:57.320
or 4K or something like that, I kept them on there,

28:57.320 --> 28:59.720
thinking RAID 5 will protect it.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.240
You know, just, I lost a bunch of stuff,

29:01.240 --> 29:06.080
including raw footage from interviews

29:06.080 --> 29:07.400
and all that kind of stuff.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.520
So it's painful.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.080
And I'm sure there's a lot of painful stuff like that

29:12.080 --> 29:15.560
for the 4,000 to 5,000 people that use QNAP.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.440
And there's a lot of interesting ethical questions here.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.440
Do you pay them?

29:20.600 --> 29:21.960
Does QNAP pay them?

29:23.280 --> 29:25.600
Do the individuals pay them?

29:25.600 --> 29:29.000
Especially when you don't know if it's going to work or not.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.240
Do you wait?

29:30.240 --> 29:33.800
So QNAP said that, please don't pay them.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.040
We're working very hard day and night to solve this.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.080
It's so philosophically interesting to me,

29:44.080 --> 29:46.520
because I also project onto them thinking,

29:46.520 --> 29:48.240
what is their motivation?

29:49.080 --> 29:52.600
Because the way they phrased it on purpose, perhaps,

29:52.600 --> 29:53.920
but I'm not sure if that actually reflects

29:53.920 --> 29:58.120
their real motivation, is maybe they're trying

29:58.120 --> 29:59.840
to help themselves sleep at night,

29:59.840 --> 30:01.920
basically saying, this is not about you.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.000
This is about the company with the vulnerabilities.

30:05.000 --> 30:05.840
Just like you mentioned,

30:05.840 --> 30:07.920
this is the justification they have.

30:07.920 --> 30:10.120
But they're hurting real people.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.680
They hurt me, but I'm sure there's a few others

30:12.680 --> 30:13.960
that are really hurt.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.200
And the zero day factor is a big one.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.320
Their QNAP right now is trying to figure out

30:22.320 --> 30:23.840
what the hell is wrong with their system

30:23.840 --> 30:25.480
that would let this in.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.480
And even if they pay, if they still don't know

30:29.480 --> 30:31.440
where the zero day is, what's to say

30:31.440 --> 30:34.200
that they won't just hit them again and hit you again?

30:34.200 --> 30:36.520
So that really complicates things.

30:36.520 --> 30:40.800
And that is a huge advancement for ransomware.

30:40.840 --> 30:44.720
It's really only been, I think, in the last 18 months

30:44.720 --> 30:48.400
that we've ever really seen ransomware exploit zero days

30:48.400 --> 30:49.240
to pull these off.

30:49.240 --> 30:54.240
Usually 80% of them, I think the data shows 80% of them

30:54.720 --> 30:58.440
come down to a lack of two-factor authentication.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.400
So when someone gets hit by a ransomware attack,

31:01.400 --> 31:04.360
they don't have two-factor authentication on,

31:04.360 --> 31:07.600
their employees were using stupid passwords.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.680
You can mitigate that in the future.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.600
This one, they don't know.

31:11.440 --> 31:12.280
They probably don't know.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.360
Yeah, and it was, I guess it's zero-click

31:14.360 --> 31:16.200
because I didn't have to do anything.

31:16.200 --> 31:20.000
The only thing, well, here's the thing.

31:21.800 --> 31:26.200
I did basics of, I put it behind a firewall,

31:26.200 --> 31:30.360
I followed instructions, but I didn't really pay attention.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.440
So maybe there's a misconfiguration

31:33.440 --> 31:36.280
of some sort that's easy to make.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.080
It's difficult when you have a personal NAS.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.440
So I'm not willing to sort of say

31:43.440 --> 31:45.480
that I did everything I possibly could.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.760
But I did a lot of reasonable stuff

31:49.760 --> 31:51.480
and they still hit it with zero clicks.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.480
I didn't have to do anything.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.040
Yeah, well, it's like a zero day

31:54.040 --> 31:55.840
and it's a supply chain attack.

31:56.960 --> 31:59.200
You're getting hit from your supplier.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.480
You're getting hit because of your vendor.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.280
And it's also a new thing for ransomware groups

32:04.280 --> 32:07.600
to go to the individuals to pressure them to pay.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.840
There was this really interesting case,

32:09.840 --> 32:11.960
I think it was in Norway,

32:11.960 --> 32:16.080
where there was a mental health clinic that got hit

32:16.080 --> 32:17.880
and the cyber criminals were going

32:17.880 --> 32:21.560
to the patients themselves to say pay this

32:21.560 --> 32:25.400
or we're going to release your psychiatric records.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.920
I mean, talk about hell.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.560
In terms of whether to pay,

32:30.560 --> 32:33.680
that is on the cheaper end of the spectrum.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.560
From the individual or from the company?

32:35.560 --> 32:36.680
Both.

32:36.680 --> 32:39.400
We've seen, for instance,

32:39.400 --> 32:42.960
there was an Apple supplier in Taiwan.

32:42.960 --> 32:47.320
They got hit and the ransom demand was 50 million.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.440
I'm surprised it's only 1.8 million.

32:49.440 --> 32:50.840
I'm sure it's going to go up.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.320
And it's hard.

32:53.320 --> 32:57.080
There's obviously governments and maybe in this case,

32:57.080 --> 32:58.880
the company are going to tell you,

32:58.880 --> 33:02.120
we recommend you don't pay or please don't pay.

33:02.120 --> 33:06.320
But the reality on the ground is that some businesses

33:06.320 --> 33:09.640
can't operate, some countries can't function.

33:09.640 --> 33:14.640
I mean, the under-reported storyline of colonial pipeline

33:15.920 --> 33:19.280
was after the company got hit

33:19.280 --> 33:22.160
and took the preemptive step of shutting down the pipeline

33:22.160 --> 33:24.200
because their billing systems were frozen,

33:24.200 --> 33:26.360
they couldn't charge customers downstream.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.160
My colleague David Zanger and I got our hands

33:30.160 --> 33:35.160
on a classified assessment that said that as a country,

33:35.800 --> 33:38.520
we could have only afforded two to three more days

33:38.520 --> 33:40.680
of colonial pipeline being down.

33:40.680 --> 33:42.080
And it was really interesting.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.520
I thought it was the gas and the jet fuel, but it wasn't.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.480
You know, we were sort of prepared for that.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.040
It was the diesel.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.280
Without the diesel, the refineries couldn't function

33:52.280 --> 33:54.760
and it would have totally screwed up the economy.

33:54.760 --> 33:59.520
And so there was almost this like national security,

33:59.520 --> 34:04.520
economic impetus for them to pay this ransom.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.960
And the other one I always think about is Baltimore.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.080
You know, when the city of Baltimore got hit,

34:09.080 --> 34:11.400
I think the initial ransom demand

34:11.400 --> 34:13.840
was something around 76,000.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.760
It may have even started smaller than that.

34:16.760 --> 34:20.040
And Baltimore stood its ground and didn't pay,

34:20.040 --> 34:25.040
but ultimately the cost to remediate was $18 million.

34:25.120 --> 34:26.760
It's a lot for the city of Baltimore.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.040
That's money that could have gone

34:28.040 --> 34:32.440
to public school education and roads and public health.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.160
And instead, it just went to rebuilding

34:35.160 --> 34:36.320
these systems from scratch.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.120
And so a lot of residents in Baltimore were like,

34:39.120 --> 34:43.520
why the hell didn't you pay the $76,000?

34:43.520 --> 34:45.640
So it's not obvious.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.120
You know, it's easy to say don't pay

34:48.120 --> 34:51.800
because why you're funding their R&D for the next go round.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.920
But it's too often, it's too complicated.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.760
So on the individual level, just like, you know,

34:59.760 --> 35:03.280
the way I feel personally from this attack,

35:03.280 --> 35:05.320
have you talked to people that were kind of victims

35:05.320 --> 35:07.880
in the same way I was, but maybe more dramatic ways

35:07.880 --> 35:10.160
or so on, you know, in the same way

35:10.160 --> 35:13.120
that violence hurts people?

35:13.120 --> 35:14.960
How much has this hurt people in your sense

35:14.960 --> 35:16.680
and the way you researched it?

35:16.680 --> 35:21.000
The worst ransomware attack I've covered

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
on a personal level was an attack on a hospital in Vermont.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.120
And, you know, you think of this as like,

35:30.120 --> 35:31.760
okay, it's hitting their IT networks.

35:31.760 --> 35:34.640
They should still be able to treat patients.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.360
But it turns out that cancer patients

35:37.360 --> 35:39.240
couldn't get their chemo anymore

35:39.240 --> 35:42.960
because the protocol of who gets what is very complicated.

35:42.960 --> 35:47.000
And without it, nurses and doctors couldn't access it.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.480
So they were turning chemo patients away,

35:50.480 --> 35:52.120
cancer patients away.

35:52.120 --> 35:55.640
One nurse told us, I don't know why people

35:55.640 --> 35:57.280
aren't screaming about this,

35:57.280 --> 35:59.680
that the only thing I've seen that even compares

35:59.680 --> 36:02.040
to what we're seeing at this hospital right now

36:02.040 --> 36:04.440
was when I worked in the burn unit

36:04.440 --> 36:06.840
after the Boston Marathon bombing.

36:06.840 --> 36:10.520
You know, they really put it in these super dramatic terms.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.840
And last year, there was a report

36:13.840 --> 36:16.880
in the Wall Street Journal where they attributed

36:16.880 --> 36:20.720
an infant death to a ransomware attack

36:20.720 --> 36:25.240
because a mom came in and whatever device

36:25.240 --> 36:29.200
they were using to monitor the fetus wasn't working

36:29.200 --> 36:30.680
because of the ransomware attack.

36:30.680 --> 36:33.600
And so they attributed this infant death

36:33.600 --> 36:34.680
to the ransomware attack.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.920
Now, on a bigger scale, but less personal,

36:39.120 --> 36:41.320
when there was the NotPetya attack.

36:41.320 --> 36:45.520
So this was an attack by Russia on Ukraine

36:46.520 --> 36:49.560
that came at them through a supplier,

36:49.560 --> 36:53.080
a tax software company in that case,

36:53.080 --> 36:56.800
that didn't just hit any government agency

36:56.800 --> 36:59.680
or business in Ukraine that used this tax software.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.680
It actually hit any business all over the world

37:02.680 --> 37:07.360
that had even a single employee working remotely in Ukraine.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.520
So it hit Marist, the shipping company,

37:09.520 --> 37:11.680
but hit Pfizer, hit FedEx,

37:11.680 --> 37:14.560
but the one I will never forget is Merck.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.760
It paralyzed Merck's factories.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.320
I mean, it really created an existential crisis

37:20.320 --> 37:21.600
for the company.

37:21.600 --> 37:25.400
Merck had to tap into the CDC's emergency supplies

37:25.400 --> 37:27.800
of the Gardasil vaccine that year

37:27.800 --> 37:29.920
because their whole vaccine production line

37:29.920 --> 37:32.160
had been paralyzed in that attack.

37:32.160 --> 37:36.040
Imagine if that was gonna happen right now

37:36.040 --> 37:39.840
to Pfizer or Moderna or Johnson & Johnson.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.200
Imagine.

37:41.200 --> 37:43.400
I mean, that would really create

37:43.400 --> 37:47.240
a global cyber terrorist attack, essentially.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.320
And that's almost unintentional.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.240
I thought for a long time,

37:51.240 --> 37:53.800
I always labeled it as collateral damage.

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
Collateral damage, yeah.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.280
But actually just today,

37:57.280 --> 38:02.280
there was a really impressive threat researcher at Cisco,

38:02.760 --> 38:05.360
which has this threat intelligence division called Talos,

38:05.360 --> 38:08.960
who said, stop calling it collateral damage.

38:08.960 --> 38:12.240
They could see who was gonna get hit

38:12.240 --> 38:15.640
before they deployed that malware.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.960
It wasn't collateral damage.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.040
It was intentional.

38:19.040 --> 38:21.640
They meant to hit any business

38:21.640 --> 38:23.200
that did business with Ukraine.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.320
It was to send a message to them, too.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.720
So I don't know if that's accurate.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.920
I always thought of it

38:29.920 --> 38:32.000
as sort of the sloppy collateral damage,

38:32.000 --> 38:33.960
but it definitely made me think.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.000
So how much of this between states

38:37.000 --> 38:40.680
is going to be a part of war?

38:40.680 --> 38:43.960
This kind of, these kinds of attacks on Ukraine,

38:45.080 --> 38:48.720
between Russia and US, Russia and China,

38:48.720 --> 38:50.000
China and US.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.240
Let's look at China and US.

38:53.240 --> 38:58.240
Do you think China and US are going to escalate

38:59.000 --> 39:01.360
something that would be called a war,

39:01.360 --> 39:03.000
purely in the space of cyber?

39:03.920 --> 39:08.920
I believe any geopolitical conflict from now on

39:12.240 --> 39:16.400
is guaranteed to have some cyber element to it.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.480
The Department of Justice recently declassified a report

39:20.480 --> 39:22.720
that said China's been hacking into our pipelines,

39:22.720 --> 39:25.240
and it's not for intellectual property theft.

39:25.240 --> 39:28.480
It's to get a foothold so that if things escalate

39:28.480 --> 39:31.920
in Taiwan, for example, they are where they need to be

39:31.920 --> 39:33.280
to shut our pipelines down.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.960
And we just got a little glimpse

39:34.960 --> 39:37.840
of what that looked like with Colonial Pipeline

39:37.840 --> 39:40.920
and the panic buying and the jet fuel shortages

39:40.920 --> 39:44.560
and that assessment I just mentioned about the diesel.

39:44.560 --> 39:48.200
So they're there, they've got in there.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.440
Anytime I read a report about new aggression

39:53.440 --> 39:57.120
from fighter jets, Chinese fighter jets in Taiwan,

39:57.120 --> 40:00.680
or what's happening right now with Russia's buildup

40:00.680 --> 40:04.640
on the Ukraine border or India, Pakistan,

40:04.640 --> 40:07.440
I'm always looking at it through a cyber lens.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.360
And it really bothers me that other people aren't

40:11.480 --> 40:15.520
because there is no way that these governments

40:15.520 --> 40:19.240
and these nation states are not going to use their access

40:19.240 --> 40:23.760
to gain some advantage in those conflicts.

40:23.760 --> 40:28.640
And I'm now in a position where I'm an advisor

40:28.640 --> 40:32.680
to the cyber security infrastructure security agency

40:32.680 --> 40:37.560
at DHS, so I'm not saying anything classified here,

40:37.560 --> 40:41.200
but I just think that it's really important

40:41.200 --> 40:46.000
to understand just generally what the collateral damage

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
could be for American businesses and critical infrastructure

40:50.000 --> 40:54.040
in any of these escalated conflicts around the world.

40:54.040 --> 40:59.040
Because just generally our adversaries have learned

40:59.280 --> 41:02.640
that they might never be able to match us

41:02.640 --> 41:05.040
in terms of our traditional military spending

41:05.040 --> 41:08.040
on traditional weapons and fighter jets,

41:08.040 --> 41:12.920
but we have a very soft underbelly when it comes to cyber.

41:12.920 --> 41:17.360
80% or more of America's critical infrastructure,

41:17.360 --> 41:22.360
so pipelines, power grid, nuclear plants, water systems

41:23.200 --> 41:26.520
is owned and operated by the private sector.

41:26.520 --> 41:31.520
And for the most part, there is nothing out there legislating

41:31.640 --> 41:35.760
that those companies share the fact they've been breached,

41:35.760 --> 41:37.320
they don't even have to tell the government

41:37.320 --> 41:39.960
they've been hit, there's nothing mandating

41:39.960 --> 41:42.360
that they even meet a bare minimum standard

41:42.360 --> 41:46.720
of cyber security, and that's it.

41:46.720 --> 41:49.440
So even when there are these attacks most of the time,

41:49.440 --> 41:51.360
we don't even know about it.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.360
So that is, if you were gonna design a system

41:54.360 --> 41:58.000
to be as blind and vulnerable as possible,

41:58.000 --> 42:01.840
that's pretty good, that's what it looks like,

42:01.840 --> 42:04.480
is what we have here in the United States.

42:04.480 --> 42:08.440
And everyone here is just operating like,

42:08.440 --> 42:12.200
let's just keep hooking up everything for convenience,

42:12.200 --> 42:13.880
software eats the world.

42:14.840 --> 42:18.640
Let's just keep going for cost, for convenience sake,

42:18.640 --> 42:20.760
just because we can.

42:20.760 --> 42:24.400
And when you study these issues and you study these attacks

42:24.400 --> 42:29.400
and you study the advancement and the uptick in frequency

42:29.400 --> 42:32.960
and the lower barrier to entry that we see

42:32.960 --> 42:37.520
every single year, you realize just how dumb

42:37.520 --> 42:39.880
software eats world is.

42:39.880 --> 42:43.160
And no one has ever stopped to pause and think,

42:43.160 --> 42:46.240
should we be hooking up these systems to the internet?

42:46.800 --> 42:50.280
They've just been saying, can we, let's do it.

42:50.280 --> 42:51.520
And that's a real problem.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.560
And just in the last year,

42:53.560 --> 42:55.840
we've seen a record number of zero day attacks.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.880
I think there were 80 last year,

42:57.880 --> 43:01.880
which is probably more than double what it was in 2019.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.080
A lot of those were nation states.

43:05.640 --> 43:09.240
We live in a world with a lot of geopolitical hot points

43:09.240 --> 43:14.240
right now, and where those geopolitical hot points are,

43:15.080 --> 43:19.080
are places where countries have been investing heavily

43:19.080 --> 43:21.720
in offensive cyber tools.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.440
If you're a nation state,

43:24.720 --> 43:29.480
the goal would be to maximize the footprint of zero day,

43:29.480 --> 43:33.320
like super secret zero day that nobody's aware of.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.960
And whenever war is initiated,

43:35.960 --> 43:38.840
the huge negative effects of shutting down infrastructure

43:38.840 --> 43:41.960
or any kind of zero day is the chaos it creates.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.560
So if you just, there's a certain threshold

43:43.560 --> 43:45.200
when you create the chaos,

43:45.200 --> 43:48.880
the markets plummet, just everything goes to hell.

43:51.000 --> 43:51.840
So there's-

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
It's not just zero days.

43:52.840 --> 43:56.600
We make it so easy for threat actors.

43:56.600 --> 44:00.440
I mean, we're not using two factor authentication.

44:00.440 --> 44:01.760
We're not patching.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.840
There was the shell shock vulnerability

44:04.840 --> 44:08.160
that was discovered a couple years ago.

44:08.160 --> 44:09.880
It's still being exploited

44:09.880 --> 44:12.240
because so many people haven't fixed it.

44:13.880 --> 44:17.040
So the zero days are really the sexy stuff.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.720
And what really drew me to the zero day market

44:19.720 --> 44:21.880
was the moral calculus we talked about,

44:23.280 --> 44:26.720
particularly from the US government's point of view.

44:26.720 --> 44:31.720
How do they justify leaving these systems so vulnerable

44:31.960 --> 44:34.040
when we use them here

44:34.040 --> 44:36.600
and we're baking more of our critical infrastructure

44:36.600 --> 44:38.640
with this vulnerable software?

44:38.640 --> 44:41.600
It's not like we're using one set of technology

44:41.600 --> 44:42.880
and Russia is using another

44:42.880 --> 44:43.760
and China's using this.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.920
We're all using the same technology.

44:45.920 --> 44:48.880
So when you find a zero day in Windows,

44:48.880 --> 44:50.600
you're not just leaving it open

44:50.600 --> 44:52.360
so you can spy on Russia

44:52.360 --> 44:54.560
or implant yourself in the Russian grid.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.480
You're leaving Americans vulnerable too.

44:57.480 --> 45:02.200
But zero days are like, that is the secret sauce.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.000
That's the superpower.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.880
And I always say like every country now,

45:07.880 --> 45:09.400
with the exception of Antarctica,

45:09.400 --> 45:11.960
someone added the Vatican to my list,

45:12.000 --> 45:15.480
is trying to find offensive hacking tools

45:15.480 --> 45:17.560
and zero days to make them work.

45:17.560 --> 45:20.640
And those that don't have the skills

45:20.640 --> 45:23.480
now have this market that they can tap into

45:23.480 --> 45:26.440
where $2.5 million, that's chump change

45:26.440 --> 45:28.160
for a lot of these nation states.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.360
It's a hell of a lot less

45:29.360 --> 45:31.920
than trying to build the next fighter jet.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.480
But yeah, the goal is chaos.

45:34.480 --> 45:38.440
I mean, why did Russia turn off the lights twice in Ukraine?

45:39.040 --> 45:42.720
You know, I think part of it is chaos.

45:42.720 --> 45:46.200
I think part of it is to sow the seeds of doubt

45:46.200 --> 45:47.920
in their current government.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.360
Your government can't even keep your lights on.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.760
Why are you sticking with them?

45:52.760 --> 45:56.360
Come over here and we'll keep your lights on at least.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.320
There's like a little bit of that.

45:58.320 --> 46:03.320
Nuclear weapons seems to have helped prevent nuclear war.

46:04.600 --> 46:08.280
Is it possible that we have so many vulnerabilities

46:09.120 --> 46:11.240
and so many attack vectors on each other

46:11.240 --> 46:15.240
that it will kind of achieve the same kind of equilibrium

46:15.240 --> 46:17.760
like mutually shared destruction?

46:17.760 --> 46:18.720
Yeah.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.720
That's one hopeful solution to this.

46:20.720 --> 46:23.760
Do you have any hope for this particular solution?

46:23.760 --> 46:26.480
You know, nuclear analogies always tend to fall apart

46:26.480 --> 46:27.520
when it comes to cyber,

46:27.520 --> 46:30.960
mainly because you don't need fissile material.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.280
You know, you just need a laptop and the skills

46:33.280 --> 46:34.560
and you're in the game.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.820
So it's a really low barrier to entry.

46:37.820 --> 46:40.900
The other thing is attributions harder.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.260
And we've seen countries muck around with attribution.

46:44.260 --> 46:47.100
We've seen nation states piggyback

46:47.100 --> 46:49.260
on other countries' spy operations

46:49.260 --> 46:53.340
and just sit there and siphon out whatever they're getting.

46:53.340 --> 46:56.100
We learned some of that from the Snowden documents.

46:56.100 --> 46:58.860
We've seen Russia hack into Iran's command

46:58.860 --> 47:01.340
and control attack servers.

47:01.340 --> 47:05.380
We've seen them hit a Saudi petrochemical plant

47:05.380 --> 47:08.140
where they did neutralize the safety locks at the plant

47:08.140 --> 47:10.120
and everyone assumed that it was Iran,

47:10.120 --> 47:13.620
given Iran had been targeting Saudi oil companies forever.

47:13.620 --> 47:14.780
But nope, it turned out

47:14.780 --> 47:17.740
that it was a graduate research institute outside Moscow.

47:17.740 --> 47:20.220
So you see countries kind of playing around

47:20.220 --> 47:21.060
with attribution.

47:21.060 --> 47:22.240
Why?

47:22.240 --> 47:25.340
I think because they think, okay, if I do this,

47:25.340 --> 47:27.760
like how am I gonna cover up that it came from me

47:27.760 --> 47:30.840
because I don't wanna risk the response.

47:30.840 --> 47:33.140
So people are sort of dancing around this.

47:33.140 --> 47:34.940
It's just in a very different way.

47:35.500 --> 47:39.580
And at the times I'd covered the Chinese hacks

47:39.580 --> 47:42.820
of infrastructure companies like pipelines.

47:42.820 --> 47:46.100
I'd covered the Russian probes of nuclear plants.

47:46.100 --> 47:50.060
I'd covered the Russian attacks on the Ukraine grid.

47:50.060 --> 47:53.820
And then in 2018, my colleague David Sanger and I

47:53.820 --> 47:57.120
covered the fact that US cyber command

47:57.120 --> 47:59.580
had been hacking into the Russian grid

47:59.580 --> 48:02.180
and making a pretty loud show of it.

48:02.220 --> 48:05.260
And when we went to the National Security Council,

48:05.260 --> 48:06.820
because that's what journalists do

48:06.820 --> 48:08.100
before they publish a story,

48:08.100 --> 48:11.420
they give the other side a chance to respond.

48:11.420 --> 48:13.100
I assumed we would be in

48:13.100 --> 48:16.420
for that really awkward painful conversation

48:16.420 --> 48:18.540
where they would say, you will have blood on your hands

48:18.540 --> 48:19.980
if you publish this story.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.980
And instead they gave us the opposite answer.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.140
They said, we have no problem

48:25.140 --> 48:27.220
with you publishing this story.

48:27.220 --> 48:28.060
Why?

48:28.060 --> 48:29.360
Well, they didn't say it out loud,

48:29.360 --> 48:33.160
but it was pretty obvious they wanted Russia to know

48:33.160 --> 48:35.360
that we're hacking into their power grid too.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.480
And they better think twice before they do to us

48:38.480 --> 48:40.200
what they had done to Ukraine.

48:40.200 --> 48:44.640
So yeah, we have stumbled into this new era

48:44.640 --> 48:47.760
of mutually assured digital destruction.

48:47.760 --> 48:52.760
I think another sort of quasi norm we've stumbled into

48:54.520 --> 48:57.680
is proportional responses.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.560
There's this idea that if you get hit,

49:00.560 --> 49:03.480
you're allowed to respond proportionally

49:03.480 --> 49:05.760
at a time and place of your choosing.

49:05.760 --> 49:08.440
That is how the language always goes.

49:08.440 --> 49:12.880
That's what Obama said after North Korea hit Sony.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.640
We will respond at a time and place of our choosing.

49:16.920 --> 49:21.120
But no one really knows what that response looks like.

49:21.120 --> 49:22.760
And so what you see a lot of the time

49:22.760 --> 49:27.440
are just these like, just short of war attacks.

49:27.440 --> 49:29.320
Russia turned off the power in Ukraine,

49:29.320 --> 49:32.080
but it wasn't like it stayed off for a week.

49:32.080 --> 49:34.000
It stayed off for a number of hours.

49:35.200 --> 49:39.680
Not Petya hit those companies pretty hard,

49:39.680 --> 49:41.360
but no one died.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.560
And the question is, what's gonna happen when someone dies?

49:44.560 --> 49:48.320
And can a nation state masquerade

49:48.320 --> 49:51.640
as a cyber criminal group, as a ransomware group?

49:51.640 --> 49:53.880
And that's what really complicates coming

49:53.880 --> 49:57.160
to some sort of digital Geneva convention.

49:57.960 --> 50:01.120
There's been a push from Brad Smith at Microsoft.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.680
We need a digital Geneva convention.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.080
And on its face, it sounds like a no-brainer.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.880
Yeah, why wouldn't we all agree to stop hacking

50:08.880 --> 50:11.120
into each other's civilian hospital systems,

50:11.120 --> 50:15.560
elections, power grid, pipelines?

50:15.560 --> 50:19.800
But when you talk to people in the West,

50:19.800 --> 50:22.480
officials in the West, they'll say we would never,

50:22.480 --> 50:25.560
we'd love to agree to it, but we'd never do it

50:25.600 --> 50:30.600
when you're dealing with Xi or Putin or Kim Jong-un

50:30.600 --> 50:35.320
because a lot of times they outsource these operations

50:35.320 --> 50:37.120
to cyber criminals.

50:37.120 --> 50:39.400
In China, we see a lot of these attacks come

50:39.400 --> 50:43.120
from this loose satellite network of private citizens

50:43.120 --> 50:46.760
that work at the behest of the Ministry of State Security.

50:46.760 --> 50:51.440
So how do you come to some sort of state-to-state agreement

50:51.440 --> 50:55.800
when you're dealing with transnational actors

50:55.800 --> 50:59.240
and cyber criminals where it's really hard to pin down

50:59.240 --> 51:01.720
whether that person was acting alone

51:01.720 --> 51:03.840
or whether they were acting at the behest

51:03.840 --> 51:06.640
of the MSS or the FSB?

51:06.640 --> 51:09.520
And a couple of years ago, I remember,

51:09.520 --> 51:11.840
can't remember if it was before or after NotPetya,

51:11.840 --> 51:14.800
but Putin said, hackers are like artists

51:14.800 --> 51:18.040
who wake up in the morning in a good mood and start painting.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.320
In other words, I have no say over what they do

51:20.400 --> 51:21.440
or don't do.

51:21.440 --> 51:24.320
So how do you come to some kind of norm

51:24.320 --> 51:26.920
when that's how he's talking about these issues

51:26.920 --> 51:30.160
and he's just decimated Merck and Pfizer

51:30.160 --> 51:34.200
and another however many thousand companies?

51:34.200 --> 51:35.680
That is the fundamental difference

51:35.680 --> 51:38.880
between nuclear weapons and cyber attacks

51:38.880 --> 51:40.400
is the attribution.

51:40.400 --> 51:42.520
Or one of the fundamental differences,

51:42.520 --> 51:45.200
if you can fix one thing in the world

51:45.200 --> 51:47.200
in terms of cybersecurity

51:47.200 --> 51:48.960
that would make the world a better place,

51:49.000 --> 51:51.160
what would you fix?

51:51.160 --> 51:54.120
So you're not allowed to fix like authoritarian regimes

51:54.120 --> 51:57.960
and you have to keep that,

51:57.960 --> 52:00.640
you have to keep human nature as it is.

52:00.640 --> 52:05.120
In terms of on the security side, technologically speaking,

52:05.120 --> 52:06.560
you mentioned there's no regulation

52:06.560 --> 52:09.040
on companies in the United States.

52:10.040 --> 52:14.920
What if you could just fix with the snap of a finger,

52:14.920 --> 52:15.760
what would you fix?

52:15.760 --> 52:19.880
Two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication.

52:19.880 --> 52:24.880
It's ridiculous how many of these attacks come in

52:24.880 --> 52:27.680
because someone didn't turn on multi-factor authentication.

52:27.680 --> 52:30.760
I mean, colonial pipeline, okay?

52:30.760 --> 52:35.480
They took down the biggest conduit for gas, jet fuel

52:35.480 --> 52:36.760
and diesel to the East Coast

52:36.760 --> 52:39.240
of the United States of America, how?

52:39.240 --> 52:42.200
Because they forgot to deactivate an old employee account

52:42.200 --> 52:44.720
whose password had been traded on the dark web

52:44.720 --> 52:48.040
and they'd never turned on two-factor authentication.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.160
This water treatment facility outside Florida

52:50.160 --> 52:51.720
was hacked last year.

52:51.720 --> 52:53.240
How did it happen?

52:53.240 --> 52:56.520
They were using Windows XP from like a decade ago

52:56.520 --> 52:59.320
that can't even get patches if you want it to

52:59.320 --> 53:01.720
and they didn't have two-factor authentication.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.720
Time and time again,

53:02.720 --> 53:06.800
if they just switched on two-factor authentication,

53:06.800 --> 53:08.360
some of these attacks wouldn't have been possible.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.120
Now, if I could snap my fingers,

53:10.120 --> 53:11.840
that's the thing I would do right now.

53:11.840 --> 53:15.120
But of course, this is a cat and mouse game

53:15.120 --> 53:17.600
and then the attackers onto the next thing.

53:17.600 --> 53:21.760
But I think right now that is like bar none.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.700
That is just, that is the easiest, simplest way

53:24.700 --> 53:25.920
to deflect the most attacks.

53:25.920 --> 53:29.800
And the name of the game right now isn't perfect security.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.260
Perfect security is impossible.

53:32.260 --> 53:34.360
They will always find a way in.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.680
The name of the game right now is make yourself

53:36.680 --> 53:40.280
a little bit harder to attack than your competitor

53:40.280 --> 53:41.520
than anyone else out there

53:42.200 --> 53:44.360
so that they just give up and move along.

53:44.360 --> 53:48.760
And maybe if you are a target for an advanced nation state

53:48.760 --> 53:53.760
or the SVR, you're gonna get hacked no matter what.

53:53.900 --> 53:56.560
But you can make cyber criminal groups,

53:56.560 --> 53:59.840
deadbolt is it, you can make their jobs a lot harder

54:00.800 --> 54:03.200
simply by doing the bare basics.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.280
And the other thing is stop reusing your passwords.

54:05.280 --> 54:08.080
But if I only get one, then two-factor authentication.

54:08.080 --> 54:10.500
So what is two-factor authentication?

54:10.500 --> 54:13.300
Factor one is what, logging in with a password.

54:13.300 --> 54:15.940
Factor two is like have another device

54:15.940 --> 54:18.460
or another channel through which you can confirm,

54:18.460 --> 54:19.500
yeah, that's me.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.580
Yes, you know, usually this happens

54:21.580 --> 54:23.540
through some kind of text.

54:23.540 --> 54:25.340
You know, you get your one-time code

54:25.340 --> 54:28.700
from Bank of America or from Google.

54:28.700 --> 54:31.460
The better way to do it is spend $20

54:31.460 --> 54:34.280
buying yourself a Fido key on Amazon.

54:34.280 --> 54:36.100
That's a hardware device.

54:36.100 --> 54:39.500
And if you don't have that hardware device with you,

54:39.500 --> 54:41.340
then you're not gonna get in.

54:41.340 --> 54:43.580
And the whole goal is, I mean, basically,

54:43.580 --> 54:46.060
you know, my first half of my decade at the Times

54:46.060 --> 54:49.100
was spent covering like the copy.

54:49.100 --> 54:51.380
It was like Home Depot got breached,

54:51.380 --> 54:54.420
News at 11, you know, Target, Neiman Marcus,

54:54.420 --> 54:58.420
like who wasn't hacked over the course of those five years.

54:58.420 --> 55:01.100
And a lot of those companies that got hacked,

55:01.100 --> 55:02.220
what did hackers take?

55:02.220 --> 55:05.500
They took the credentials, they took the passwords.

55:05.500 --> 55:08.860
They can make a pretty penny selling them on the dark web.

55:09.020 --> 55:11.540
And people reuse their passwords.

55:11.540 --> 55:14.780
So you get one from, you know, God knows who,

55:14.780 --> 55:17.100
I don't know, LastPass,

55:17.100 --> 55:19.340
the worst case example, actually, LastPass.

55:19.340 --> 55:21.860
But you get one, and then you go test it

55:21.860 --> 55:23.420
on their email account,

55:23.420 --> 55:25.580
and you go test it on their brokerage account,

55:25.580 --> 55:28.460
and you test it on their cold storage account.

55:28.460 --> 55:29.580
You know, that's how it works.

55:29.580 --> 55:32.900
But if you have multi-factor authentication,

55:32.900 --> 55:34.500
then they can't get in,

55:34.500 --> 55:36.740
because they might have your password,

55:36.740 --> 55:38.060
but they don't have your phone,

55:38.060 --> 55:40.300
they don't have your Fido key, you know,

55:40.300 --> 55:42.700
and so you keep them out.

55:42.700 --> 55:46.060
And, you know, I get a lot of alerts

55:46.060 --> 55:48.420
that tell me someone is trying to get into

55:48.420 --> 55:50.980
your Instagram account, or your Twitter account,

55:50.980 --> 55:53.340
or your email account, and I don't worry,

55:53.340 --> 55:55.860
because I use multi-factor authentication.

55:55.860 --> 55:57.180
They can trial day.

55:58.380 --> 55:59.500
Okay, I worry a little bit,

55:59.500 --> 56:03.820
but you know, it's the simplest thing to do,

56:03.820 --> 56:05.100
and we don't even do it.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.860
Well, there's an interface aspect to it,

56:06.860 --> 56:09.940
because it's pretty annoying if it's implemented poorly.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.460
Yeah, that's true.

56:11.460 --> 56:13.100
So actually, bad implementation

56:13.100 --> 56:14.780
of two-factor authentication,

56:15.660 --> 56:19.060
not just bad, but just something that adds friction

56:19.060 --> 56:21.380
is a security vulnerability, I guess,

56:21.380 --> 56:23.500
because it's really annoying.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.460
Like, I think MIT, for a while,

56:25.460 --> 56:28.580
had two-factor authentication, it was really annoying.

56:28.580 --> 56:33.020
I just, like, the number of times it pings you,

56:33.020 --> 56:37.460
like, it asked to re-authenticate

56:37.460 --> 56:39.980
across multiple subdomains, like,

56:39.980 --> 56:41.740
it just feels like a pain.

56:42.740 --> 56:44.140
I don't know what the right balance there.

56:44.140 --> 56:46.380
Yeah, it feels like friction

56:46.380 --> 56:48.700
in our frictionless society.

56:48.700 --> 56:51.060
It feels like friction, it's annoying.

56:51.060 --> 56:54.260
That's security's biggest problem, it's annoying.

56:54.260 --> 56:57.900
You know, we need the Steve Jobs of security to come along,

56:57.900 --> 56:59.660
and we need to make it painless.

56:59.860 --> 57:02.060
And actually, you know, on that point,

57:02.060 --> 57:07.060
Apple has probably done more for security than anyone else

57:07.300 --> 57:10.900
simply by introducing biometric authentication,

57:10.900 --> 57:13.620
first with the fingerprint and then with Face ID.

57:13.620 --> 57:15.980
And it's not perfect, but, you know,

57:15.980 --> 57:17.420
if you think just eight years ago,

57:17.420 --> 57:20.380
everyone was running around with either no passcode,

57:20.380 --> 57:23.540
an optional passcode, or four-digit passcode on their phone

57:23.540 --> 57:26.100
that anyone, you know, think of what you can get

57:26.100 --> 57:29.060
when you get someone's iPhone, if you steal someone's iPhone.

57:29.100 --> 57:30.980
And, you know, props to them

57:30.980 --> 57:33.660
for introducing the fingerprint and Face ID.

57:33.660 --> 57:36.980
And again, it wasn't perfect, but it was a huge step forward.

57:36.980 --> 57:40.220
Now it's time to make another huge step forward.

57:41.140 --> 57:42.900
I wanna see the password die.

57:42.900 --> 57:46.900
I mean, it's gotten us as far as it was ever gonna get us,

57:46.900 --> 57:49.620
and I hope whatever we come up with next

57:49.620 --> 57:52.420
is not gonna be annoying, is gonna be seamless.

57:52.420 --> 57:55.100
When I was at Google, that's what we worked on is,

57:55.100 --> 57:58.580
and there's a lot of ways to call this active authentication,

57:58.580 --> 57:59.900
passive authentication.

57:59.900 --> 58:02.500
So basically you use biometric data,

58:02.500 --> 58:05.980
not just like a fingerprint, but everything from your body

58:05.980 --> 58:09.140
to identify who you are, like movement patterns.

58:09.140 --> 58:12.700
So basically create a lot of layers of protection

58:12.700 --> 58:15.420
where it's very difficult to fake,

58:15.420 --> 58:18.780
including like face unlock,

58:18.780 --> 58:21.260
checking that it's your actual face,

58:21.260 --> 58:24.220
like the liveness tests, so like from video.

58:24.220 --> 58:27.220
So unlocking it with video, voice,

58:27.260 --> 58:30.020
the way you move the phone,

58:31.060 --> 58:33.260
the way you take it out of the pocket, that kind of thing.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.060
All of those factors.

58:35.060 --> 58:37.340
It's a really hard problem though.

58:37.340 --> 58:42.060
And ultimately it's very difficult to beat the password

58:42.060 --> 58:43.580
to have a security.

58:43.580 --> 58:46.180
Well, there's a company that I actually will call out

58:46.180 --> 58:48.220
and that's Abnormal Security.

58:48.220 --> 58:51.420
So they work on email attacks.

58:51.420 --> 58:56.420
And it was started by a couple guys who were doing,

58:56.580 --> 58:59.340
I think, ad tech at Twitter.

58:59.340 --> 59:01.780
So ad technology now,

59:01.780 --> 59:03.980
it's a joke how much they know about us.

59:03.980 --> 59:05.820
You always hear the conspiracy theories

59:05.820 --> 59:08.180
that you saw someone's shoes

59:08.180 --> 59:10.380
and next thing you know, it's on your phone.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.340
It's amazing what they know about you.

59:13.620 --> 59:15.740
And they're basically taking that

59:16.620 --> 59:19.660
and they're applying it to attacks.

59:19.660 --> 59:21.860
So they're saying, okay,

59:21.860 --> 59:24.900
if you're, this is what your email patterns are.

59:24.900 --> 59:26.340
It might be different for you and me

59:27.260 --> 59:29.660
because we're emailing strangers all the time.

59:29.660 --> 59:30.980
But for most people,

59:30.980 --> 59:33.900
their email patterns are pretty predictable.

59:33.900 --> 59:37.020
And if something strays from that pattern,

59:37.020 --> 59:39.740
that's abnormal and they'll block it.

59:39.740 --> 59:41.740
They'll investigate it.

59:41.740 --> 59:43.900
And that's great.

59:43.900 --> 59:48.620
Let's start using that kind of targeted ad technology

59:48.620 --> 59:50.540
to protect people.

59:50.540 --> 59:52.980
And yeah, I mean, it's not gonna get us away

59:52.980 --> 59:56.300
from the password and using multifactor authentication

59:57.300 --> 59:59.940
but the technology is out there

59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.060
and we just have to figure out how to use it

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:03.380
in a really seamless way

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.660
because it doesn't matter

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.540
if you have the perfect security solution,

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.380
if no one uses it.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.340
I mean, when I started at the times

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.180
when I was trying to be really good

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.860
about protecting sources,

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.700
I was trying to use PGP encryption.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.780
And it's like, it didn't work.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.380
The number of mistakes I would probably make

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:25.420
just trying to email someone with PGP

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.060
just wasn't worth it.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.020
And then Signal came along

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:32.460
and Signal made it wicker.

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:34.660
They made it a lot easier

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.980
to send someone an encrypted text message.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.980
So we have to start investing in creative minds

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.380
in good security design.

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.900
I really think that's the hack

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:50.060
that's gonna get us out of where we are today.

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:52.420
What about social engineering?

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.740
Do you worry about this sort of hacking people?

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.620
Yes.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.900
I mean, this is the worst nightmare

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.140
of every chief information security officer out there.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.020
Social engineering, we work from home now.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:15.060
I saw this woman posted online about how her husband,

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.740
it went viral today,

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.980
but it was her husband had this problem at work.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.420
They hired a guy named John,

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.020
and now the guy that shows up for work every day

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:27.500
doesn't act like John.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.220
I mean, think about that.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.980
Think about the potential for social engineering

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.740
in that context.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.940
You apply for a job and you put on a pretty face,

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.380
you hire an actor or something,

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.660
and then you just get inside the organization

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:45.700
and get access to all that organization's data.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.420
A couple of years ago,

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:51.420
Saudi Arabia planted spies inside Twitter.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.260
Why?

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.460
Probably because they were trying to figure out

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.380
who these people were

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.220
who were criticizing the regime on Twitter.

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:00.020
They couldn't do it with a hack from the outside,

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.220
so why not plant people on the inside?

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.500
And that's the worst nightmare.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.780
And it also, unfortunately,

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.780
creates all kinds of xenophobia

01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.300
at a lot of these organizations.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.740
I mean, if you're gonna have to take that into consideration,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.660
then organizations are gonna start looking

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:19.380
really skeptically and suspiciously

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.140
at someone who applies for that job from China.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.740
And we've seen that go really badly

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:28.500
at places like the Department of Commerce,

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.420
where they basically accuse people

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:31.980
of being spies that aren't spies.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.380
So it is the hardest problem to solve.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.340
And it's never been harder to solve

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:39.140
than right at this very moment

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.300
when there's so much pressure for companies

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.940
to let people work remotely.

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:45.500
That's actually why I'm single.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.420
I'm suspicious that China and Russia,

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.660
every time I meet somebody,

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:52.940
are trying to plant and get insider information.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.740
So I'm very, very suspicious.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.260
I keep putting the Turing test in front.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:58.460
No.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.740
No, I have a friend who worked inside NSA

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.860
and was one of their top hackers.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.580
And he's like, every time I go to Russia,

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:10.860
I get hit on by these 10s.

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:12.260
And I come home, my friends are like,

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:13.820
I'm sorry, you're not a 10.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.020
It's a common story.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.940
I mean, it's difficult to trust humans

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.820
in this day and age online.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:27.460
So we're working remotely, that's one thing,

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.380
but just interacting with people on the internet.

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:32.500
It sounds ridiculous.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.300
But because of this podcast in part,

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.900
I've gotten to meet some incredible people.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:42.380
But it makes you nervous to trust folks.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.260
And I don't know how to solve that problem.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.500
So I'm talking with Mark Zuckerberg,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.500
who dreams about creating the metaverse.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:56.860
What do you do about that world

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.500
where more and more our lives is in the digital sphere?

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.340
Like one way to phrase it is,

01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.980
most of our meaningful experiences

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.180
at some point will be online.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.820
Like falling in love, getting a job,

01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:19.900
or experiencing a moment of happiness with a friend,

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.100
with a new friend made online, all of those things.

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:25.540
Like more and more, the fun we do,

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.940
the things that make us love life will happen online.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.940
And if those things have an avatar that's digital,

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.820
that's like a way to hack into people's minds,

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:39.500
whether it's with AI or kind of troll farms

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.980
or something like that.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.340
I don't know if there's a way to protect against that.

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.340
That might fundamentally rely on our faith

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.980
in how good human nature is.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.940
So if most people are good, we're going to be okay.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:59.260
But if people will tend towards manipulation

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:03.340
and unleveled behavior in search of power,

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.580
then we're screwed.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.900
So I don't know if you can comment

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.420
on how to keep the metaverse secure.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:15.060
Yeah, I mean, all I thought about when you were talking

01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.780
just now is my three-year-old son.

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.740
You know, he asked me the other day,

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:22.540
what's the internet, mom?

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.900
And I just almost wanted to cry.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:30.420
You know, I don't want that for him.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:33.220
I don't want all of his most meaningful experiences

01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:34.060
to be online.

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.140
You know, by the time that happens,

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:40.140
how do you know that person's human?

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.260
That avatar's human.

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.580
You know, I believe in free speech.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.500
I don't believe in free speech for robots and bots.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:52.340
And like, look what just happened over the last six years.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.900
You know, we had bots pretending

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.900
to be Black Lives Matter activists just to sow some division

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.740
or, you know, Texas secessionists

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:06.620
or, you know, organizing anti-Hillary protests

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.060
or just to sow more division,

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.460
to tie us up in our own politics

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.100
so that we're so paralyzed.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.700
We can't get anything done.

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.260
We can't make any progress

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.980
and we definitely can't handle our adversaries

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.580
and their long-term thinking.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.300
It really scares me.

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.340
And here's where I just come back to,

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:32.260
just because we can create the metaverse,

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:36.420
you know, just because it sounds like the next logical step

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.900
in our digital revolution.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:44.020
Do I really want my child's most significant moments

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.620
to be online?

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.980
They weren't for me, you know?

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:51.980
So maybe I'm just stuck in that old school thinking

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.620
or maybe I've seen too much.

01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:59.420
And I'm really sick of being the guinea pig

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:01.780
parent generation for these things.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:04.420
I mean, it's hard enough with screen time.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:08.620
Like thinking about how to manage the metaverse

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.460
as a parent to a young boy,

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.660
like I can't even let my head go there.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:16.340
That's so terrifying for me.

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:21.300
But we've never stopped any new technology

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.980
just because it introduces risks.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.860
We've always said, okay, the promise of this technology

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:31.700
means we should keep going, keep pressing ahead.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.100
We just need to figure out new ways to manage that risk.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.900
And you know, that's the blockchain right now.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:44.820
Like when I was covering all of these ransomware attacks,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.660
I thought, okay, this is gonna be it for cryptocurrency.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:51.340
You know, governments are gonna put the kibosh down.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.780
They're gonna put the hammer down and say,

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.340
enough is enough.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.860
Like we have to put this genie back in the bottle

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.500
because it's enabled ransomware.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:02.660
I mean, five years ago, they would hijack your PC

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:05.460
and they'd say, go to the local pharmacy,

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:08.300
get a e-gift card and tell us what the pin is

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.420
and then we'll get your $200.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:13.380
Now it's pay us, you know, five Bitcoin.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.100
And so there's no doubt cryptocurrencies

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.820
enabled ransomware attacks,

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:22.540
but after the colonial pipeline ransom was seized,

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.700
because if you remember, the FBI was actually able to go in

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.100
and claw some of it back from dark side,

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:31.180
which was the ransomware group that hid it.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:34.100
And I spoke to these guys at TRM Labs.

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:37.340
So they're one of these blockchain intelligence companies.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:38.660
And a lot of people that work there

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.900
used to work at the treasury.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:42.180
And what they said to me was,

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:46.420
yeah, cryptocurrency has enabled ransomware,

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:51.100
but to track down that ransom payment

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.260
would have taken, you know,

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.780
if we were dealing with fiat currency,

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.340
would have taken us years

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.300
to get to that one bank account

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.500
or belonging to that one front company in the Seychelles.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.020
And now thanks to the blockchain,

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.300
we can track the movement of those funds in real time.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.460
And you know what?

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.940
You know, these payments are not as anonymous

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.260
as people think.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.620
Like we still can use our old hacking ways and zero days

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.540
and, you know, old school intelligence methods

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.740
to find out who owns that private wallet

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.420
and how to get to it.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:27.620
So it's a curse in some ways in that it's an enabler,

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.420
but it's also a blessing.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.220
And they said that same thing to me

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.060
that I just said to you.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.060
They said, we've never shut down a promising new technology

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.140
because it introduced risk.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:42.700
We just figured out how to manage that risk.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.380
And I think that's where the conversation

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.860
unfortunately has to go,

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:50.860
is how do we in the metaverse use technology

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.580
to fix things?

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.020
So maybe we'll finally be able to, not finally,

01:09:57.020 --> 01:10:00.980
but figure out a way to solve the identity problem

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.420
on the internet, meaning like a blue check mark

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.980
for actual human and connect it to identity

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:11.420
like a fingerprint so you can prove your you

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:15.820
and yet do it in a way that doesn't involve the company

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:17.620
having all your data.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:21.780
So allowing you to maintain control over your data

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.980
or if you don't, then there's complete transparency

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:28.740
of how that data is being used, all those kinds of things.

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:32.020
And maybe as you educate more and more people,

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:36.100
they would demand in a capitalist society

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.460
that the companies that they give their data to

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.060
will respect that data.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:43.620
Yeah, I mean, there is this company

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.900
and I hope they succeed.

01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:48.580
Their name's P-I-I-A-N-O, Piano.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.540
And they wanna create a vault

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.460
for your personal information inside every organization.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.000
And ultimately, if I'm gonna call Delta Airlines

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.700
to book a flight, they don't need to know

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.500
my social security number,

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:05.540
they don't need to know my birth date.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:08.900
They're just gonna send me a one-time token to my phone.

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:11.740
My phone's gonna say, or my Fido key is gonna say,

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:13.500
yep, it's her.

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.620
And then we're gonna talk about my identity,

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.620
like a token, some random token.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.080
They don't need to know exactly who I am,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.820
they just need to know the system trust that I am,

01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:27.900
who I say I am, but they don't get access to my P-I-I data.

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.380
They don't get access to my social security number,

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:34.820
my location, or the fact I'm a Times journalist.

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:37.140
I think that's the way the world's gonna go.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.300
Enough is enough on losing

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.100
our personal information everywhere,

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.900
letting data marketing companies track our every move.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:51.020
They don't need to know who I am.

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.500
Okay, I get it.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.420
We're stuck in this world where the internet runs on ads.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:59.940
So ads are not gonna go away,

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.020
but they don't need to know I'm Nicole Perlera.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.020
They can know that I am token number X567.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.700
X567.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.060
And they can let you know what they know

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.060
and give you control about removing the things they know.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.880
Yeah, right, to be forgotten.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.980
To me, you should be able to walk away

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.300
with a single press of a button.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.100
And I also believe that most people,

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.260
given the choice to walk away, won't walk away.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.580
They'll just feel better about having the option

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:30.740
to walk away when they understand the trade-offs.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.580
If you walk away, you're not gonna get

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:34.180
some of the personalized experiences

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.980
that you would otherwise get,

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.580
like a personalized feed and all those kinds of things.

01:12:38.580 --> 01:12:40.860
But the freedom to walk away is,

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:44.220
I think, really powerful.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.740
And obviously, what you're saying is,

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.620
there's all of these HTML forms

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.220
where you have to enter your phone number and email

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.740
and private information from Delta, every single airline.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.780
New York Times.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.580
I have so many opinions on this.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.420
Just the friction and the sign-up

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:04.820
and all of those kinds of things.

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.180
I should be able to, this has to do with everything.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.860
This has to do with payment, too.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.780
Payment should be trivial.

01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.700
It should be one click and one click

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.980
to unsubscribe and subscribe,

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.540
and one click to provide all of your information

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.700
that's necessary for the subscription service,

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.500
for the transaction service,

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:25.340
whatever that is, getting a ticket,

01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:27.580
as opposed to, I have all of these fake phone numbers

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.380
and emails that I use in the AltaSign.

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:34.340
Because you never know if one site is hacked,

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.580
then it's just going to propagate to everything else.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.780
Yeah.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.100
And there's low-hanging fruit,

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.420
and I hope Congress does something.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.620
And frankly, I think it's negligent they haven't

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:51.620
on the fact that elderly people are getting spammed to death

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:56.460
on their phones these days with fake car warranty scams.

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:59.500
And I mean, my dad was in the hospital last year,

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.100
and I was in the hospital room, and his phone kept buzzing,

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:07.100
and I look at it, and it's just spam attack after spam attack,

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.180
people nonstop calling about his freaking car warranty,

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.980
why they're trying to get his social security number,

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:17.660
they're trying to get his PII,

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:19.860
they're trying to get this information.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:24.020
We need to figure out how to put those people

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:28.740
in jail for life, and we need to figure out

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:32.540
why in the hell we are being required

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:37.020
or asked to hand over our social security number

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.940
and our home address and our passport,

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.340
all of that information to every retailer who asks.

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.220
I mean, that's insanity.

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.780
And there's no question they're not protecting it

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:54.780
because it keeps showing up in spam or identity theft

01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.100
or credit card theft afterwards.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.300
Well, the spam is getting better,

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.180
and maybe I need to, as a side note,

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.300
make a public announcement, please clip this out,

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:08.220
which is if you get an email or a message

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:13.220
from Lex Fridman saying how much I, Lex, appreciate you

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:18.260
and love you and so on, and please connect with me

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:21.540
on my WhatsApp number and I will give you Bitcoin

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.060
or something like that, please do not click.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:29.060
And I'm aware that there's a lot of this going on,

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.220
a very large amount, I can't do anything about it.

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:33.820
This is on every single platform,

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:36.060
it's happening more and more and more,

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.900
which I've been recently informed

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:42.960
that they're now emailing, so it's cross-platform.

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:46.100
They're taking people's, they're somehow,

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.540
this is fascinating to me because they are taking people

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.860
who comment on various social platforms

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.060
and they somehow reverse engineer,

01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:57.780
they figure out what their email is,

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:00.780
and they send an email to that person saying,

01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:04.060
from Lex Fridman, and it's like a heartfelt email

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.500
with links, it's fascinating because it's cross-platform now.

01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:11.060
It's not just a spam bot that's messaging

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.500
and a comment that's in a reply.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.420
They are saying, okay, this person cares

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.520
about this other person on social media,

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.480
so I'm going to find another channel,

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.660
which in their mind probably increases,

01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:26.500
and it does, the likelihood that they'll get

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.000
the people to click, and they do.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.180
I don't know what to do about that.

01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:32.180
It makes me really, really sad,

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.580
especially with podcasting, there's an intimacy

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.820
that people feel connected and they get really excited,

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.500
oh, okay, cool, I wanna talk to Lex.

01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:46.260
And they click, and I get angry at the people that do this.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:54.940
I mean, it's like the John that gets hired,

01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.500
the fake employee, I don't know what to do about that.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:02.180
I mean, I suppose the solution is education.

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.300
It's telling people to be skeptical on the stuff they click.

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.500
That balance with the technology solution

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:14.100
of creating a maybe like two-factor authentication

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:17.860
and maybe helping identify things

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:20.340
that are likely to be spam, I don't know.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.940
But then the machine learning there is tricky

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:25.260
because you don't wanna add a lot of extra friction

01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:28.140
that just annoys people because they'll turn it off

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.700
because you have the accept cookies thing, right,

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.380
that everybody has to click on now,

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:34.580
so now they completely ignore the accept cookies.

01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:39.940
This is very difficult to find that frictionless security.

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.300
You mentioned Snowden, you've talked about

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.300
looking through the NSA documents he leaked

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:51.980
and doing the hard work of that.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.500
What do you make of Edward Snowden?

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.700
What have you learned from those documents?

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.900
What do you think of him?

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.420
In the long arc of history,

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:05.460
is Edward Snowden a hero or a villain?

01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.460
I think he's neither.

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:11.420
I have really complicated feelings about Edward Snowden.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:15.740
On the one hand, I'm a journalist at heart

01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.580
and more transparency is good.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.020
And I'm grateful for the conversations that we had

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:29.020
in the post Snowden era about the limits to surveillance

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:33.060
and how critical privacy is.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.620
And when you have no transparency

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.020
and you don't really know in that case

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.020
what our secret courts were doing,

01:18:41.740 --> 01:18:45.660
how can you truly believe that our country

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.820
is taking our civil liberties seriously?

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.260
So on the one hand, I'm grateful

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:54.860
that he cracked open these debates.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:19:00.860
On the other hand, when I walked into the storage closet

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:07.980
of classified NSA secrets, I had just spent two years

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:14.220
covering Chinese cyber espionage almost every day

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:19.220
and this sort of advancement of Russian attacks

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:23.180
that were just getting worse and worse and more destructive.

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:27.420
And there were no limits to Chinese cyber espionage

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.740
and Chinese surveillance of its own citizens.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.620
And there seemed to be no limit to what Russia

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:37.260
was willing to do in terms of cyber attacks

01:19:37.260 --> 01:19:41.300
and also in some cases, assassinating journalists.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.020
So when I walked into that room,

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:46.740
there was a part of me quite honestly,

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:51.260
that was relieved to know that the NSA was as good

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:52.660
as I hoped they were.

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:58.460
And we weren't using that knowledge to,

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.260
as far as I know, assassinate journalists.

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:08.300
We weren't using our access to take out

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.020
pharmaceutical companies.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:12.780
For the most part, we were using it

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:15.620
for traditional espionage.

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.900
Now, that set of documents also set me

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.060
on the journey of my book, because to me,

01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:26.100
the American people's reaction to the Snowden documents

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.860
was a little bit misplaced.

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.420
They were upset about the phone call

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:34.020
metadata collection program.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:36.380
Angela Merkel, I think rightfully was upset

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.360
that we were hacking her cell phone.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.580
But in sort of the spy, eat spy world,

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:45.260
hacking world leader cell phones is pretty much

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.340
what most spy agencies do.

01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:51.580
And there wasn't a lot that I saw in those documents

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:56.580
that was beyond what I thought a spy agency does.

01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:01.000
And I think if there was another 9-11 tomorrow,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.740
God forbid, we would all say, how did the NSA miss this?

01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.900
Why weren't they spying on those terrorists?

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.780
Why weren't they spying on those world leaders?

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:13.160
You know, there's some of that too.

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.760
But I think that there was great damage done

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.680
to the US's reputation.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.480
I think we really lost our halo

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.460
in terms of a protector of civil liberties.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:33.680
And I think a lot of what was reported

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.000
was unfortunately reported in a vacuum.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.080
That was my biggest gripe,

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:42.320
that we were always reporting,

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:45.200
the NSA has this program and here's what it does.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:48.680
And the NSA is in Angela Merkel's cell phone

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.760
and the NSA can do this.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.640
And no one was saying, and by the way,

01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:00.240
China has been hacking into our pipelines

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.480
and they've been making off

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:04.120
with all of our intellectual property.

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.600
And Russia has been hacking into our energy infrastructure.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:11.340
And they've been using the same methods to spy on track

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:13.980
and in many cases, kill their own journalists.

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.780
And the Saudis have been doing this

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:17.340
to their own critics and dissidents.

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:21.240
And so you can't talk about any of these countries

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:22.740
in isolation.

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:25.860
It is really like spy eats spy out there.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.060
And so I just have complicated feelings.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:30.380
You know, and the other thing is,

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.040
and I'm sorry, this is a little bit of a tangent,

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.040
but the amount of documents that we had,

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.820
like thousands of documents,

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.900
most of which were just crap,

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.980
but had people's names on them.

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.940
You know, part of me wishes that those documents

01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:53.020
had been released in a much more targeted, limited way.

01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:56.380
It's just a lot of it just felt like a PowerPoint

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:58.620
that was taken out of context.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:03.060
And you just sort of wish

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.920
that there had been a little bit more thought

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.740
into what was released.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.100
Because I think a lot of the impact from someone

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:13.420
was just the volume of the reporting.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:17.100
But I think, you know, based on what I saw personally,

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.420
there was a lot of stuff that I just,

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:24.140
I don't know why that particular thing got released.

01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:26.820
As a whistleblower, what's the better way to do it?

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.780
Because I mean, there's fear, there's,

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:33.600
it takes a lot of effort to do a more targeted release.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.000
You know, if there's proper channels,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.240
you're afraid that those channels will be manipulated.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.480
Like, who do you trust?

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.560
What's a better way to do this, do you think?

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.600
As a journalist, this is almost like a journalistic question.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.620
Reveal some fundamental flaw in the system

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.200
without destroying the system.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.880
I bring up, you know, again, Mark Zuckerberg and Metta,

01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:59.080
there was a whistleblower that came out

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:02.080
about Instagram, internal studies.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:06.980
And I also torn about how to feel about that whistleblower

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:10.800
because from a company perspective that's an open culture,

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:14.880
how can you operate successfully if you have an open culture

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.900
where any one whistleblower can come out,

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.360
out of context, take a study,

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.800
whether it represents a larger context or not,

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:25.400
and the press eats it up.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.960
And then that creates a narrative that is,

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.940
just like with the NSA, you said it's out of context,

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:36.180
it's very targeted to where, well, Facebook is evil,

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.900
clearly because of this one leak.

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.540
It's really hard to know what to do there

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.100
because we're now in a society

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.540
that's deeply distrust institutions.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:47.980
And so narratives by whistleblowers

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:49.140
make that whistleblower

01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.300
and their forthcoming book very popular.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.460
And so there's a huge incentive to take stuff out of context

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:59.420
and to tell stories that don't represent the full context,

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:00.400
the full truth.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.120
It's hard to know what to do with that

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:06.940
because then that forces Facebook and Metta and governments

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:09.800
to be much more conservative, much more secretive.

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:13.200
It's like a race to the bottom.

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:14.600
I don't know.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.280
I don't know if you can comment on any of that,

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:19.320
how to be a whistleblower ethically and properly.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:21.600
I don't know.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.440
I mean, these are hard questions.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:27.240
And even for myself, like in some ways,

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.760
I think of my book as sort of blowing the whistle

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.000
on the underground zero-day market.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.880
But it's not like I was in the market myself.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.480
It's not like I had access to classified data

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.360
when I was reporting out that book.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.840
As I say in the book, like, listen,

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:49.540
I'm just trying to scrape the surface here

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:53.040
so we can have these conversations before it's too late.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.100
And I'm sure there's plenty in there

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:01.820
that someone who's US intelligence agency's

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:04.100
preeminent zero-day broker probably

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.960
has some voodoo doll of me out there.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.960
And you're never gonna get it 100%.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.900
But I really applaud whistleblowers like the whistleblower

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:22.340
who blew the whistle on the Trump call with Zelensky.

01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:25.340
I mean, people needed to know about that,

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:30.500
but we were basically in some ways blackmailing an ally

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.780
to try to influence an election.

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:37.300
I mean, they went through the proper channels.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.480
They weren't trying to profit off of it, right?

01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:42.100
There was no book that came out afterwards

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.100
from that whistleblower.

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:45.780
That whistleblower's not like,

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:47.900
they went through the channels.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.700
They're not living in Moscow.

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.180
Let's put it that way.

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.020
Can I ask you a question?

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:54.340
You mentioned NSA, one of the things it showed

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.220
is they're pretty good at what they do.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:03.500
Again, this is a touchy subject, I suppose,

01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:06.300
but there's a lot of conspiracy theories

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.060
about intelligence agencies.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.220
From your understanding of intelligence agencies,

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:16.000
the CIA, NSA, and the equivalent in other countries,

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:20.020
are they one question, this could be a dangerous question,

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.620
are they competent, are they good at what they do,

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.920
and two, are they malevolent in any way?

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.660
Sort of, I recently had a conversation

01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.180
about tobacco companies

01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:39.540
that kind of see their customers as dupes,

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:43.320
like they can just play games with people.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.460
Conspiracy theories tell that similar story

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.540
about intelligence agencies

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:51.660
that they're interested in manipulating the populace

01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:54.940
for whatever ends the powerful,

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:59.940
in dark rooms, cigarette smoke, cigar smoke-filled rooms.

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:04.620
What's your sense?

01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:09.620
Do these conspiracy theories have any truth to them,

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.420
or are intelligence agencies, for the most part,

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:15.700
good for society?

01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.380
Okay, well, that's an easy one.

01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:19.220
Is it?

01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.780
No, I think it depends which intelligence agency.

01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:25.840
Think about the Mossad.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.840
They're killing every Iranian nuclear scientist they can

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:37.740
over the years, but have they delayed the time horizon

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.540
before Iran gets the bomb?

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:45.540
Yeah, have they probably staved off terror attacks

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:46.780
on their own citizens?

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.620
Yeah.

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:53.660
Intelligence is intelligence.

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:58.660
You can't just say they're malevolent or they're heroes.

01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:02.620
Everyone I have met in this space

01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:07.400
is not the pound your chest patriot

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.540
that you see on the beach on the 4th of July.

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.140
A lot of them have complicated feelings

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:17.700
about their former employers.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:20.540
Well, at least at the NSA reminded me

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.540
to do what we were accused of doing after Snowden,

01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.820
to spy on Americans.

01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:33.340
You have no idea the amount of red tape

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:37.820
and paperwork and bureaucracy it would have taken

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.180
to do what everyone thinks that we were supposedly doing.

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:46.860
But then we find out in the course of this Snowden reporting

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:49.500
about a program called Lovin,

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:53.040
where a couple of the NSA analysts were using their access

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:55.380
to spy on their ex-girlfriends.

01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:59.280
So there's an exception to every case.

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:05.220
Generally, I will probably get accused

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.620
of my Western bias here again,

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:12.620
but I think you can almost barely compare

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:17.280
some of these Western intelligence agencies

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.020
to China, for instance.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:25.020
And the surveillance that they're deploying on the Uyghurs

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.020
to the level they're deploying it

01:30:28.980 --> 01:30:32.140
and the surveillance they're starting to export abroad

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.620
with some of the programs like the watering hole attack

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.540
I mentioned earlier,

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.020
where it's not just hitting the Uyghurs inside China,

01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:40.380
it's hitting anyone interested

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:42.100
in the Uyghur plight outside China.

01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:44.620
I mean, it could be an American high school student

01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:46.580
writing a paper on the Uyghurs.

01:30:46.580 --> 01:30:49.140
They want to spy on that person too.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.780
You know, there's no rules in China

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.820
really limiting the extent of that surveillance.

01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:58.620
And we all better pay attention

01:30:58.620 --> 01:30:59.980
to what's happening with the Uyghurs

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:04.060
because just as Ukraine has been to Russia

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:08.260
in terms of a test kitchen for its cyber attacks,

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:12.900
the Uyghurs are China's test kitchen for surveillance.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.300
And there's no doubt in my mind

01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:17.660
that they're testing them on the Uyghurs.

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.140
Uyghurs are their petri dish,

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.220
and eventually they will export

01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.880
that level of surveillance overseas.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.880
I mean, in 2015, Obama and Xi Jinping reached a deal

01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.640
where basically the White House said,

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:35.640
you better cut it out on intellectual property theft.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:37.240
And so they made this agreement

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:40.680
that they would not hack each other for commercial benefit.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.840
And for a period of about 18 months,

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.520
we saw this huge drop-off

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.920
in Chinese cyber attacks on American companies.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.240
But some of them continued.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:51.480
Where did they continue?

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.480
They continued on aviation companies,

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.480
on hospitality companies like Marriott.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:31:59.800
Why?

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:02.600
Because that was still considered fair game to China.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.240
It wasn't IP theft they were after.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.680
They wanted to know who was staying in this city

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.880
at this time when Chinese citizens were staying there

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.280
so they could cross match for counterintelligence

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.080
who might be a likely Chinese spy.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.640
I'm sure we're doing some of that too.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.640
Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.640
It's considered fair game to China.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:24.760
Counterintelligence is counterintelligence.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.280
It's considered fair game.

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:30.400
But where I think it gets evil

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.200
is when you use it for censorship,

01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.060
to suppress any dissent,

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.740
to do what I've seen the UAE do to its citizens

01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.160
where people who've gone on Twitter

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.560
just to advocate for better voting rights,

01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:49.320
more enfranchisement,

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:52.440
suddenly find their passports confiscated,

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.320
I talked to one critic, Ahmed Mansour,

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.760
and he told me,

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:01.040
you might find yourself a terrorist,

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.400
labeled a terrorist one day

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.680
and you don't even know how to operate a gun.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.520
I mean, he'd been beaten up

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:08.000
every time he tried to go somewhere.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.640
His passport had been confiscated.

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.600
By that point it turned out

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.080
they'd already hacked into his phone

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:14.160
so they were listening to us talking.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.320
They'd hacked into his baby monitor

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:18.480
so they're spying on his child

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.320
and they stole his car.

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:24.640
And then they created a new law

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:27.740
that you couldn't criticize the ruling family

01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.320
or the ruling party on Twitter.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.280
And he's been in solitary confinement every day

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.120
since on hunger strike.

01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.240
So that's evil.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.720
That's evil.

01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:40.760
And we still, we don't do that here.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.020
We have rules here.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:44.440
We don't cross that line.

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.320
So yeah, in some cases,

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.840
I won't go to Dubai.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.960
I won't go to Abu Dhabi.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:51.600
If I ever wanna go to the Maldives,

01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:54.920
like too bad, like most of the flights go through Dubai.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:57.180
So there's some lines we're not willing to cross.

01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:58.960
But then again, just like you said,

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:02.720
there's individuals within NSA, within CIA

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.800
and they may have power.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.880
And to me, there's levels of evil.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:11.360
To me personally, this is the stuff of conspiracy theories

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:13.920
is the things you've mentioned as evil

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.180
are more direct attacks.

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:19.180
But there's also psychological warfare.

01:34:19.180 --> 01:34:20.840
So blackmail.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:25.620
So what does spying allow you to do?

01:34:25.620 --> 01:34:27.860
Allow you to collect information

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.180
if you have something that's embarrassing

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:33.620
or if you have like Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theories,

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.800
active, what is it?

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:38.500
Manufacture of embarrassing things

01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.120
and then use blackmail to manipulate the population

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:42.900
or all the powerful people involved.

01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:45.860
It troubles me deeply that MIT allowed somebody

01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:48.620
like Jeffrey Epstein in their midst,

01:34:48.620 --> 01:34:51.660
especially some of the scientists I admire

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:54.280
that they would hang out with that person at all.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:57.880
And so, I'll talk about it sometimes.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:00.280
And then a lot of people tell me,

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.380
well, obviously, Jeffrey Epstein is a front for intelligence.

01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:09.380
And I just, I struggled to see that level of competence

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.740
and malevolence.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.340
But, who the hell am I?

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:21.180
And I guess I was trying to get to that point.

01:35:21.180 --> 01:35:22.980
You said that there is bureaucracy and so on,

01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.740
which makes some of these things very difficult.

01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:27.420
I wonder how much malevolence,

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:31.660
how much competence there is in these institutions.

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:34.860
Like how far, this takes us back to the hacking question.

01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:39.860
How far are people willing to go if they have the power?

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.700
This has to do with social engineering.

01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:42.780
This has to do with hacking.

01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:45.400
This has to do with manipulating people,

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.360
attacking people, doing evil onto people,

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.280
psychological warfare and stuff like that.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:51.480
I don't know.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.960
I believe that most people are good.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:59.400
And I don't think that's possible in a free society.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.440
There's something that happens

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:02.560
when you have a centralized government

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:05.600
where power corrupts over time

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.460
and you start surveillance programs kind of,

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:12.960
it's like a slippery slope that over time

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:17.960
starts to both use fear and direct manipulation

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.040
to control the populace.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:25.040
But in a free society, it's difficult for me to imagine

01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:27.720
that you can have like something like a Jeffrey Epstein

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.400
in front for intelligence.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.800
I don't know what I'm asking you, but I'm just,

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.960
I have a hope that for the most part,

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:39.880
intelligence agencies are trying to do good

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.040
and are actually doing good for the world.

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.700
When you view it in the full context

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:47.680
of the complexities of the world.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:55.160
But then again, if they're not, would we know?

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.360
That's why Edwin Snowden might be a good thing.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.480
Let me ask you on a personal question.

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.240
You have investigated some of the most powerful organizations

01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:07.620
and people in the world of cyber warfare, cybersecurity.

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.600
Are you ever afraid for your own life,

01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.280
your own well-being digital or physical?

01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.920
I mean, I've had my moments, you know,

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:20.840
I've had our security team at the times called me

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.280
at one point and said, someone's on the dark web

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.880
offering good money to anyone who can hack

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880
your phone or your laptop.

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.040
I describe in my book how when I was at that

01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:35.240
hacking conference in Argentina, I came back

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.680
and I brought a burner laptop with me,

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:40.760
but I'd kept it in the safe anyway

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.480
and it didn't have anything on it,

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.320
but someone had broken in and it was moved.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.640
You know, I've had all sorts of sort of scary moments.

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:55.520
And then I've had moments where I think I went

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.920
just way too far into the paranoid side.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:03.920
I mean, I remember writing about the times hack by China

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:07.460
and I just covered a number of Chinese cyber attacks

01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:10.060
where they'd gotten into the thermostat

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.620
at someone's corporate apartment

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:15.820
and you know, they'd gotten into all sorts of stuff.

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:19.980
And I was living by myself, I was single in San Francisco

01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.700
and my cable box on my television started making

01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.960
some weird noises in the middle of the night.

01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:29.700
And I got up and I ripped it out of the wall

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.100
and I think I said something like, embarrassing,

01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.700
like, fuck you China, you know.

01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:38.700
And then I went back to bed and I woke up

01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.700
and like, it's like beautiful morning light.

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:42.620
I mean, I'll never forget it.

01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.260
Like, this is like glimmering morning light shining

01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:48.140
on my cable box, which has now been ripped out

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.700
and is sitting on my floor and like the morning light.

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:53.900
And I was just like, no, no, no,

01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.940
like I'm not going down that road.

01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.940
Like you basically, I came to a fork in the road

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:06.140
where I could either go full tinfoil hat,

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:10.060
go live off the grid, never have a car with navigation,

01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:12.540
never use Google maps, never own an iPhone,

01:39:12.540 --> 01:39:16.380
never order diapers off Amazon, you know,

01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:21.380
create an alias or I could just do the best I can

01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.100
and live in this new digital world we're living in.

01:39:26.100 --> 01:39:28.140
And what does that look like for me?

01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.780
I mean, what are my crown jewels?

01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.660
This is what I tell people.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.780
What are your crown jewels?

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.180
Cause just focus on that.

01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.620
You can't protect everything,

01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:37.500
but you can protect your crown jewels.

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:39.020
For me, for the longest time,

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.340
my crown jewels were my sources.

01:39:42.340 --> 01:39:44.540
I was nothing without my sources.

01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:49.420
So I had some sources I would meet the same dim someplace

01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:51.660
or maybe it was a different restaurant

01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:55.340
on the same date, you know, every quarter

01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.060
and we would never drive there.

01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.380
We would never Uber there.

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:02.100
We wouldn't bring any devices.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:05.060
I could bring a pencil and a notepad.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:07.220
And if someone wasn't in town,

01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:09.140
like there were a couple of times where I'd show up

01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.180
and the source never came,

01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.780
but we never communicated digitally.

01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:16.500
And those were the lengths I was willing to go

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.540
to protect that source, but you can't do it for everyone.

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.100
So for everyone else, you know,

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.780
it was signal using two factor authentication, you know,

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:26.980
keeping my devices up to date,

01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:30.700
not clicking on phishing emails, using a password manager,

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:34.500
all the things that we know we're supposed to do.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.340
And that's what I tell everyone, like, don't go crazy

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.300
because then that's like the ultimate hack.

01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:43.660
Then they've hacked your mind, whoever they is for you,

01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:45.220
but just do the best you can.

01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:50.220
Now, my whole risk model changed when I had a kid,

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:54.700
you know, now it's, oh God, you know,

01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:59.700
if anyone threatened my family, God help them.

01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:04.780
But it changes you and, you know,

01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:12.340
unfortunately there are some things

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:15.020
like I was really scared to go deep on,

01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:19.540
like Russian cyber crime, you know, like Putin himself,

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.260
you know, and it's interesting,

01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:24.580
like I have a mentor who's an incredible person

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.540
who was the Times Moscow bureau chief during the Cold War.

01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:32.020
And after I wrote a series of stories

01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:35.020
about Chinese cyber espionage, he took me out to lunch

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:37.940
and he told me that when he was living in Moscow,

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:40.100
he would drop his kids off at preschool

01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:42.660
when they were my son's age now

01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.780
and the KGB would follow him

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.260
and they would make a really like loud show of it.

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:51.380
You know, they'd tail him, they'd, you know, honk,

01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.260
they'd just be, make a ruckus.

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:57.620
And he said, you know what, they never actually did anything

01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:00.780
but they wanted me to know that they were following me

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.020
and I operated accordingly.

01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:05.820
And he says, that's how you should operate

01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.220
in the digital world.

01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.660
Know that there are probably people following you.

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:14.380
Sometimes they'll make a little bit of noise

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:17.540
but one thing you need to know is that

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:18.620
while you're at the New York Times,

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:21.380
you have a little bit of an invisible shield on you.

01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:23.660
You know, if something were to happen to you,

01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.100
that would be a really big deal.

01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:26.980
That would be an international incident.

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:29.380
So I kind of carried that invisible shield

01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:31.540
with me for years.

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.260
And then Jamal Khashoggi happened

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:39.340
and that destroyed my vision of my invisible shield.

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:42.820
You know, sure, you know, he was a Saudi

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:45.620
but he was a Washington Post columnist.

01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:46.940
You know, for the most part,

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:48.140
he was living in the United States.

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:50.020
He was a journalist.

01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:53.620
And for them to do what they did to him

01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:58.180
pretty much in the open and get away with it.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:43:01.860
And for the United States to let them get away with it

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:04.700
because we wanted to preserve diplomatic relations

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:09.700
with the Saudis, that really threw my worldview upside down.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.780
And, you know, I think that sent a message

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:15.620
to a lot of countries

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:19.540
that it was sort of open season on journalists.

01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:23.020
And to me, that was one of the most destructive things

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:27.420
that happened under the previous administration.

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.300
And, you know, I don't really know

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:32.340
what to think of my invisible shield anymore.

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.180
Thank you, Seth.

01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.940
That really worries me on the journalism side

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.420
that people will be afraid to dig deep

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.100
on fascinating topics.

01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:45.100
And, you know, I have my own, that's part of the reason.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.180
I would love to have kids.

01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:51.700
I would love to have a family.

01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:56.740
Part of the reason I'm a little bit afraid,

01:43:56.740 --> 01:43:57.980
there's many ways to phrase this,

01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:02.500
but the loss of freedom in the way of doing

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.020
all the crazy shit that I naturally do,

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:08.900
which I would say the ethic of journalism is kind of not,

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.180
is doing crazy shit without really thinking about it.

01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:16.020
This is letting your curiosity really allow you

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.500
to be free and explore.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:22.060
It's, I mean, whether it's stupidity or fearlessness,

01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:25.260
whatever it is, that's what great journalism is.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.220
And all the concerns about security risks

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.780
have made me like become a better person.

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:35.660
The way I approach it is just make sure

01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:37.300
you don't have anything to hide.

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.940
I know this is not a thing,

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.860
this is not an approach to security.

01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:44.900
I'm just, this is like a motivational speech or something.

01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:47.300
It's just like, if you can lose,

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.220
you can be hacked at any moment.

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:52.140
Just don't be a douchebag secretly.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:54.380
Just be like a good person.

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:56.660
Because then, I see this actually

01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.660
with social media in general.

01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.820
Just present yourself in the most authentic way possible,

01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:06.860
meaning be the same person online as you are privately.

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.220
Have nothing to hide.

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:11.740
That's one, not the only, but one of the ways

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:14.420
to achieve security.

01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:15.780
Maybe I'm totally wrong on this,

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:19.500
but don't be secretly weird.

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.820
If you're weird, be publicly weird

01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:24.260
so it's impossible to blackmail you.

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.380
That's my approach to security.

01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:26.540
Yeah, well, they call it

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:29.860
the New York Times front page phenomenon.

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:31.620
Don't put anything in email

01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:33.260
or I guess social media these days

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.740
that you wouldn't want to read

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:37.900
on the front page of the New York Times.

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:41.620
And that works, but sometimes I even get carried,

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:45.540
I mean, I have not as many followers as you,

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.060
but a lot of followers,

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.140
and sometimes even I get carried away.

01:45:49.140 --> 01:45:51.300
Just be emotional and say something, yeah.

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:56.300
Yeah, I mean, just the cortisol response on Twitter.

01:45:57.340 --> 01:46:01.580
Twitter is basically designed to elicit those responses.

01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.940
I mean, every day I turn on my computer,

01:46:04.980 --> 01:46:07.740
look at my phone, I look at what's trending on Twitter,

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:10.060
and it's like, what are the topics

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:13.780
that are gonna make people the most angry today?

01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:14.620
You know?

01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:16.100
Yeah.

01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:19.140
And you know, it's easy to get carried away,

01:46:19.140 --> 01:46:22.300
but it's also just, that sucks too,

01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:25.260
that you have to be constantly censoring yourself.

01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:26.580
And maybe it's for the better.

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:29.420
Maybe you can't be a secret asshole,

01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:31.300
and we can put that in the good bucket.

01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:33.660
But at the same time, you know,

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:38.660
there is a danger to that other voice,

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:43.020
to creativity, you know, to being weird.

01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.540
There's a danger to that little whispered voice

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:48.820
that's like, well, how would people read that?

01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:51.140
You know, how could that be manipulated?

01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:53.500
How could that be used against you?

01:46:53.500 --> 01:46:58.500
And that stifles creativity and innovation and free thought.

01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:04.500
And you know, that is on a very micro level.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:08.100
And that's something I think about a lot.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.460
And that's actually something

01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:12.380
that Tim Cook has talked about a lot.

01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:17.380
And why he has said he goes full force on privacy is,

01:47:17.740 --> 01:47:19.980
it's just that little voice

01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:23.940
that is at some level censoring you.

01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:27.460
And what is sort of the long-term impact

01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:30.980
of that little voice over time?

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.300
I think there's a ways,

01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:36.420
I think that self-censorship is an attack factor

01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:37.700
that there are solutions to.

01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:40.180
The way I'm really inspired by Elon Musk,

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:43.740
the solution to that is just be privately

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:46.780
and publicly the same person and be ridiculous.

01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:49.780
Embrace the full weirdness and show it more and more.

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:54.060
So, you know, that's memes that has like ridiculous humor.

01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:57.860
And I think, and if there is something

01:47:57.860 --> 01:48:00.940
you really wanna hide, deeply consider

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.540
if that you wanna be that.

01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:05.300
Like, why are you hiding it?

01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:07.420
What exactly are you afraid of?

01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.660
Because I think my hopeful vision for the internet

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.300
is the internet loves authenticity.

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.140
They wanna see you weird.

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:18.260
So be that and like live that fully.

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:20.220
Because I think that gray area

01:48:20.220 --> 01:48:22.380
where you're kind of censoring yourself,

01:48:23.180 --> 01:48:25.180
that's where the destruction is.

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.740
You have to go all the way, step over, be weird.

01:48:28.740 --> 01:48:31.020
And then it feels, it can be painful

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:32.540
because people can attack you and so on,

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.700
but just ride it.

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.940
I mean, that's just like a skill

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:38.060
on the social psychological level

01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:42.100
that ends up being an approach to security,

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.060
which is like remove the attack vector

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.980
of having private information

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:50.060
by being your full weird self publicly.

01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:55.900
What advice would you give to young folks today,

01:48:56.460 --> 01:49:00.700
operating in this complicated space

01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:02.540
about how to have a successful life,

01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:03.980
a life they can be proud of,

01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:05.620
a career they can be proud of,

01:49:07.660 --> 01:49:09.500
maybe somebody in high school and college

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.620
thinking about what they're going to do.

01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.660
Be a hacker.

01:49:13.540 --> 01:49:16.780
If you have any interest, become a hacker

01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:19.060
and apply yourself to defense.

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:23.940
Every time, we do have these amazing scholarship programs,

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:26.620
for instance, where they find you early,

01:49:26.620 --> 01:49:30.020
they'll pay your college as long as you commit

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.940
to some kind of federal commitment

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:35.300
to sort of help federal agencies with cybersecurity.

01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:37.860
And where does everyone want to go every year

01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.060
from the scholarship program?

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:42.220
They want to go work at the NSA or cyber command.

01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.180
They want to go work on offense.

01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.180
They want to go do the sexy stuff.

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:49.940
It's really hard to get people to work on defense.

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:52.620
It's just, it's always been more fun to be a pirate

01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:54.620
than being the Coast Guard.

01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:59.140
And so we have a huge deficit

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:01.340
when it comes to filling those roles.

01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:06.340
There's 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity positions

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.980
around the world.

01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:09.700
I mean, talk about job security,

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:12.740
like be a hacker and work on cybersecurity.

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.300
You will always have a job.

01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:18.580
And we're actually at a huge deficit

01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.260
and disadvantage as a free market economy

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:26.780
because we can't match cybersecurity salaries

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:30.020
at Palantir or Facebook or Google or Microsoft.

01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:32.420
And so it's really hard for the United States

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:33.780
to fill those roles.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.380
And other countries have had this workaround

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:41.780
where they basically have forced conscription on some level.

01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:44.340
China tells people like,

01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:46.820
you do whatever you're gonna do during the day,

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:51.300
work at Alibaba, if you need to do some ransomware, okay.

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:53.940
But the minute we tap you on the shoulder

01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:57.140
and ask you to come do this sensitive operation for us,

01:50:57.140 --> 01:50:58.420
the answer is yes.

01:50:59.340 --> 01:51:01.020
Same with Russia.

01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:03.620
A couple of years ago when Yahoo was hacked

01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:05.620
and they laid it all out in an indictment,

01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:07.620
it came down to two cyber criminals

01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.540
and two guys from the FSB.

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.140
Cyber criminals were allowed to have their fun,

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.820
but the minute they came across the username and password

01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:16.700
for someone's personal Yahoo account

01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:19.420
that worked at the White House or the State Department

01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:23.620
or military, they were expected to pass that over to the FSB.

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:24.940
So we don't do that here.

01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:27.380
And it's even worse on defense.

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.860
We really can't fill these positions.

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:34.780
So if you are a hacker, if you're interested in code,

01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:38.460
if you're a tinker, learn how to hack.

01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:42.660
There are all sorts of amazing hacking competitions

01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:47.500
you can do through the SANS org, for example, S-A-N-S.

01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:51.220
And then use those skills for good.

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:53.460
Neuter the bugs in that code

01:51:53.460 --> 01:51:56.260
that get used by autocratic regimes

01:51:56.260 --> 01:51:59.260
to make people's life a living prison.

01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:03.660
Plug those holes, defend industrial systems,

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:05.980
defend our water treatment facilities

01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:07.780
from hacks where people are trying to come in

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.780
and poison the water.

01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:12.620
That I think is just an amazing,

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:16.220
it's an amazing job on so many levels.

01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:19.660
It's intellectually stimulating.

01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.860
You can tell yourself you're serving your country.

01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:24.660
You can tell yourself you're saving lives

01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.140
and keeping people safe.

01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:28.420
And you'll always have amazing job security.

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.220
And if you need to go get that job that pays you,

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.540
two million bucks a year, you can do that too.

01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.820
And you can have a public profile,

01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:36.820
more so of a public profile.

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:38.780
You can be a public rock star.

01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:42.740
I mean, it's the same thing as sort of the military.

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:44.020
There's a lot of,

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.420
there's a lot of well-known sort of people commenting

01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:52.620
on the fact that veterans are not treated as well

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:54.060
as they should be.

01:52:54.060 --> 01:52:57.140
But it's still the fact that soldiers are deeply respected

01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:00.980
for defending the country, the freedoms,

01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.820
the ideals that we stand for.

01:53:02.820 --> 01:53:05.820
And in the same way, I mean, in some ways,

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:08.940
the cyber security defense are the soldiers of the future.

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.780
Yeah.

01:53:09.780 --> 01:53:10.660
And you know what's interesting?

01:53:10.660 --> 01:53:14.060
I mean, in cybersecurity, the difference is,

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:17.140
oftentimes you see the more interesting threats

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:20.660
in the private sector because that's where the attacks come.

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:24.260
When cyber criminals and nation state adversaries

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:25.500
come for the United States,

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:28.980
they don't go directly for cyber command or the NSA.

01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:30.900
No, they go for banks.

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:32.860
They go for Google.

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:34.100
They go for Microsoft.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.620
They go for critical infrastructure.

01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:39.540
And so those companies, those private sector companies

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:44.540
get to see some of the most advanced sophisticated attacks

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:45.700
out there.

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:48.380
And if you're working at FireEye

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.540
and you're calling out the solar winds attack, for instance,

01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:56.060
I mean, you just saved God knows how many systems

01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:59.940
from that compromise turning into something

01:53:59.940 --> 01:54:02.500
that more closely resembles sabotage.

01:54:03.500 --> 01:54:08.500
So, you know, go be a hacker and or go be a journalist.

01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:12.860
So you wrote the book,

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:15.620
This Is How They Tell Me The World Ends,

01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:17.820
as we've been talking about, of course,

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:20.020
referring to cyber war, cybersecurity.

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:25.140
What gives you hope about the future of our world?

01:54:25.140 --> 01:54:27.820
If it doesn't end, how will it not end?

01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:30.420
That's a good question.

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.260
I mean, I have to have hope, right?

01:54:32.260 --> 01:54:34.940
Because I have a kid and I have another on the way.

01:54:34.940 --> 01:54:38.580
And if I didn't have hope, I wouldn't be having kids.

01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:43.020
But it's a scary time to be having kids.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:48.220
And now it's like pandemic, climate change,

01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:52.220
disinformation, increasingly advanced,

01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:54.540
perhaps deadly cyber attacks.

01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:58.700
What gives me hope is that I share your worldview

01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:01.300
that I think people are fundamentally good.

01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:04.900
And sometimes, and this is why the metaverse

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.060
scares me to death, but when I'm reminded of that

01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:09.500
is not online.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:12.460
Like online, I get the opposite.

01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:14.580
You know, you start to lose hope in humanity

01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:16.580
when you're on Twitter half your day.

01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:21.180
It's like when I go to the grocery store or I go on a hike

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:26.180
or someone smiles at me or someone just says something nice.

01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:29.940
People are fundamentally good.

01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.700
We just don't hear from those people enough.

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:38.700
And my hope is, I just think our current political climate,

01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:41.340
like we've hit rock bottom.

01:55:41.340 --> 01:55:43.220
This is as bad as it gets.

01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:44.380
We can't do anything.

01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:45.220
Don't jinx it.

01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:48.300
Well, but I think it's a generational thing.

01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:51.460
I think baby boomers, like it's time to move along.

01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:56.860
I think it's time for a new generation to come in.

01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:01.860
And I actually have a lot of hope when I look at,

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.540
I'm sort of like this, I guess they call me

01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:07.740
a geriatric millennial or a young gen X,

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:10.100
but like we have this unique responsibility

01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:13.140
because I grew up without the internet

01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.940
and without social media.

01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:19.300
I grew up without the internet and without social media,

01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.980
but I'm native to it.

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:25.300
So I know the good and I know the bad.

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.660
And that's true on so many different things.

01:56:28.660 --> 01:56:32.060
I grew up without climate change anxiety

01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:34.860
and now I'm feeling it and I know it's not a given.

01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:38.940
We don't have to just resign ourselves to climate change.

01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.220
Same with disinformation.

01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:44.100
And I think a lot of the problems we face today

01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.660
have just exposed the sort of inertia

01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:49.980
that there has been on so many of these issues.

01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:52.940
And I really think it's a generational shift

01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:54.540
that has to happen.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:57.660
And I think this next generation is gonna come in

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.540
and say like, we're not doing business

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:01.380
like you guys did it anymore.

01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.860
We're not just gonna like rape and pillage the earth

01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:06.340
and try and turn everyone against each other

01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:10.260
and play dirty tricks and let lobbyists dictate

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:14.060
what we do or don't do as a country anymore.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.500
And that's really where I see the hope.

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.180
It feels like there's a lot of low hanging fruit

01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:23.780
for young minds to step up and create solutions and lead.

01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:28.780
So whenever politicians or leaders that are older,

01:57:30.580 --> 01:57:32.940
like you said, are acting shitty,

01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:34.140
I see that as a positive.

01:57:34.140 --> 01:57:38.100
They're inspiring a large number of young people

01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.660
to replace them.

01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.900
And so I think you're right.

01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:44.300
There's going to be, it's almost like you need people

01:57:44.300 --> 01:57:47.900
to act shitty to remind them, oh, wow, we need good leaders.

01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:51.380
We need great creators and builders and entrepreneurs

01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:54.380
and scientists and engineers and journalists.

01:57:54.380 --> 01:57:56.580
All the discussions about how the journalism

01:57:56.580 --> 01:57:58.700
is quote unquote broken and so on.

01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:02.140
That's just an inspiration for new institutions to rise up

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:03.780
that do journalism better.

01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.340
New journalists to step up and do journalism better.

01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:08.660
So I, and I've been constantly,

01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:11.780
when I talk to young people, I'm constantly impressed

01:58:11.780 --> 01:58:16.460
by the ones that dream to build solutions.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:21.340
And so that's ultimately why I put the hope,

01:58:21.340 --> 01:58:23.180
but the world is a messy place

01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:25.020
like we've been talking about.

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.260
It's a scary place.

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.740
Yeah, and I think you hit something,

01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:33.140
hit on something earlier, which is authenticity.

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:38.140
Like no one is going to rise above that is plastic.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.300
Anymore.

01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.700
People are craving authenticity.

01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:46.500
The benefit of the internet is it's really hard

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:50.220
to hide who you are on every single platform.

01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:53.460
On some level, it's going to come out who you really are.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:58.460
And so you hope that by the time my kids are grown,

01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:04.060
like no one's going to care if they made one mistake online

01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:06.020
so long as they're authentic.

01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:09.580
You know, and I used to worry about this.

01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:13.220
My nephew was born the day I graduated from college.

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:17.700
And I just always, you know, he's like born into Facebook.

01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:20.940
And I just think like, how is a kid like that

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:23.980
ever going to be president of the United States of America?

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:27.700
Because if Facebook had been around when I was in college,

01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:31.420
you know, like Jesus, you know, what,

01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:34.180
how are those kids are going to ever be president?

01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.620
There's going to be some photo of them

01:59:36.620 --> 01:59:39.340
at some point making some mistake

01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.780
and that's going to be all over for them.

01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:43.100
And now I take that back.

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:46.700
Now it's like, no, everyone's going to make mistakes.

01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:49.380
There's going to be a picture for everyone.

01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:53.020
And we're all going to have to come and grow up

01:59:53.020 --> 01:59:56.500
to the view that as humans, we're going to make huge mistakes.

01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:58.140
And hopefully they're not so big

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:00.660
that they're going to ruin the rest of your life.

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.980
But we're going to have to come around to this view

02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:04.500
that we're all human

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.300
and we're going to have to be a little bit more forgiving

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.300
and a little bit more tolerant when people mess up.

02:00:10.300 --> 02:00:12.100
And we're going to have to be a little bit more humble

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:15.620
when we do and like keep moving forward.

02:00:15.620 --> 02:00:17.660
Otherwise you can't like cancel everyone.

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:21.700
Nicole, this was an incredible, hopeful conversation.

02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:26.700
Also one that reveals that in the shadows

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.220
there's a lot of challenges to be solved.

02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:32.340
So I really appreciate that you took on

02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:34.260
this really difficult subject with your book.

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:35.820
That's journalism at its best.

02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:37.860
So I'm really grateful that you did it,

02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:40.180
that you took the risk, that you took that on

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.580
and that you plugged the cable box back in.

02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:43.820
That means you have hope.

02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:46.220
And thank you so much

02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.900
for spending your valuable time with me today.

02:00:47.900 --> 02:00:48.740
Thank you.

02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:49.860
Thanks for having me.

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.180
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:53.660
with Nicole Perlroth.

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.900

02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:01.740
from Nicole herself.

02:01:01.900 --> 02:01:05.620
Here we are entrusting our entire digital lives,

02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:09.060
passwords, texts, love letters, banking records,

02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:10.860
health records, credit card sources

02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:14.020
and deepest thoughts to this mystery box

02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:17.780
whose inner circuitry most of us would never vet,

02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:20.740
run by code written in a language most of us

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.380
will never fully understand.

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:26.460
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:32.580
Thank you.
