WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
We should never and I never sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to destroy us.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.080
They won't do it. If somebody threatens to eliminate you as Iran is doing today

00:10.720 --> 00:16.960
and as Hitler did then and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us,

00:16.960 --> 00:22.800
take them seriously and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so

00:22.800 --> 00:24.080
because that may be too late.

00:24.080 --> 00:31.840
The following is a conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, currently

00:31.840 --> 00:38.400
serving his sixth term in office. He's one of the most influential, powerful, and controversial men

00:38.400 --> 00:43.280
in the world, leading a right-wing coalition government at the center of one of the most

00:43.280 --> 00:50.000
intense and long-lasting conflicts and crises in human history. As we spoke and as I speak now,

00:50.080 --> 00:54.720
large-scale protests are breaking out all over Israel over this government's proposed judicial

00:54.720 --> 00:59.920
reform that seeks to weaken the Supreme Court in a bold accumulation of power.

01:00.800 --> 01:05.360
Given the current intense political battles in Israel, our previous intention to speak for

01:05.360 --> 01:11.280
three hours was adjusted to one hour for the time being, but we agreed to speak again for

01:11.280 --> 01:16.880
much longer in the future. I will also interview people who harshly disagree with the words spoken

01:16.880 --> 01:22.240
in this conversation. I will speak with other world leaders, with religious leaders, with

01:22.240 --> 01:29.360
historians and activists, and with people who have lived and have suffered through the pain of war,

01:29.360 --> 01:35.920
destruction, and loss that stoke the fires of anger and hate in their heart. For this,

01:35.920 --> 01:42.400
I will travel anywhere, no matter how dangerous. If there's any chance, it may help add to

01:42.480 --> 01:48.320
understanding and love in the world. I believe in the power of conversation,

01:48.320 --> 01:55.440
to do just this, to remind us of our common humanity. I know I'm under-qualified and

01:55.440 --> 02:01.520
under-skilled for these conversations, so I will often fall short and I will certainly get attacked,

02:01.520 --> 02:07.840
derided, and slandered. But I will always turn the other cheek and use these attacks to learn,

02:07.840 --> 02:15.040
to improve, and no matter what, never give in to cynicism. This life, this world of ours,

02:15.760 --> 02:22.880
is too beautiful not to keep trying, trying to do some good in whatever way each of us know how.

02:23.920 --> 02:28.160
I love you all. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it,

02:28.160 --> 02:34.240
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Benjamin Netanyahu.

02:35.200 --> 02:41.360
You're loved by many people here in Israel and in the world, but you're also hated by many.

02:42.000 --> 02:48.560
In fact, I think you may be one of the most hated men in the world. So if there's a young man or a

02:48.560 --> 02:54.480
young woman listening to this right now who have such hate in their heart, what can you say to them

02:54.960 --> 02:58.560
to one day turn that hate into love?

02:58.720 --> 03:05.520
I disagree with the premise of your question. I think I have enjoyed a very broad support

03:05.520 --> 03:13.200
around the world. There are certain corners in which we have this animosity that you describe,

03:13.200 --> 03:19.200
and it sort of permeates in some of the newspapers and news organs and so on in

03:20.080 --> 03:25.040
the United States. But it certainly doesn't reflect the broad support that I have.

03:25.040 --> 03:34.480
I just gave an interview on an Iranian channel, 16 million viewers. I gave another one,

03:34.480 --> 03:42.480
I just did a little video a few years ago, 25 million viewers from Iran. Certainly no hate

03:42.480 --> 03:47.760
there, I have to tell you. Not from the regime, okay? And when I go around the world, and I've

03:47.760 --> 03:55.360
been around the world, people want to hear what we have to say, what I have to say as a leader

03:55.360 --> 04:01.600
of Israel whom they respect increasingly as a rising power in the world. So I disagree with that.

04:01.600 --> 04:08.400
And the most important thing that goes against what you said is the respect that we receive from

04:08.400 --> 04:13.520
the Arab world and the fact that we've made four historic peace agreements with Arab countries.

04:13.520 --> 04:19.280
They made it with me, they didn't make it with anyone else. And I respect them and they respect

04:19.280 --> 04:24.560
me, and probably more to come. So I think the premise is wrong, that's all.

04:24.560 --> 04:30.640
Well, there's a lot of love, yes. A lot of leaders are collaborating.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.920
Respect, I said, not love.

04:33.920 --> 04:42.240
Okay, all right. Well, it's a spectrum. But there is people who don't have good things to say about

04:42.240 --> 04:48.160
Israel, who do have hate in their heart for Israel. And what can you say to those people?

04:49.120 --> 04:52.160
Well, I think they don't know very much. I think they're guided by a lot of

04:53.120 --> 04:57.040
ignorance. They don't know about Israel, they don't know that Israel is a stellar democracy,

04:57.040 --> 05:02.560
that it happens to be one of the most advanced societies on the planet, that what Israel develops

05:02.560 --> 05:10.960
helps humanity in every field, in medicine, in agriculture, in the environment, in telecoms,

05:10.960 --> 05:18.960
and talk about AI in a minute, but changing the world for the better and spreading this among

05:20.000 --> 05:23.760
six continents. We've sent rescue teams more than any other country in the world,

05:23.760 --> 05:28.080
and we're one-tenth of one percent of the world's population. But when there's an

05:28.640 --> 05:33.760
earthquake or a devastation in Haiti or in the Philippines, Israel is there.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.880
When there's an earthquake, a devastating earthquake in Turkey,

05:37.600 --> 05:43.920
Israel was there. When there's something in Nepal, Israel is there, and it's the second country.

05:43.920 --> 05:50.560
It's the second country. In one case, India, or after another case, the United States,

05:50.560 --> 05:55.760
Israel is there. Tiny Israel is a benefactor to all of humanity.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.440
So you're a student of history. If I could just linger on that philosophical notion of hate,

06:02.400 --> 06:12.240
that part of human nature. If you look at World War II, what do you learn from human nature,

06:12.240 --> 06:18.720
from the rise of the Third Reich and the rise of somebody like Hitler and the hate that permeates

06:18.720 --> 06:26.880
that? Well, what I've learned is that you have to nip bad things in the bud. There's a Latin term

06:26.880 --> 06:38.720
that says, stop bad things when they're small. And the deliberate hatred, the incitement of

06:38.720 --> 06:47.200
hatred against one community, its demonization, delegitimization that goes with it is a very

06:47.200 --> 06:52.320
dangerous thing. And that happened in the case of the Jews. What started with the Jews

06:52.400 --> 06:58.480
soon spread to all of humanity. So what we've learned is that's what we should never, and I

06:58.480 --> 07:03.520
never sit aside and say, oh, they're just threatening to destroy us. They won't do it.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.960
If somebody threatens to eliminate you, as Iran is doing today, and as Hitler did then,

07:08.960 --> 07:14.960
and people discounted it, well, if somebody threatens to annihilate us, take them seriously

07:14.960 --> 07:20.480
and act to prevent it early on. Don't let them have the means to do so because that may be too

07:20.480 --> 07:29.520
late. So in those threats, underlying that hatred, how much of it is anti-Zionism and how

07:29.520 --> 07:33.520
much of it is anti-Semitism? I don't distinguish between the two.

07:33.520 --> 07:38.080
You can't say, well, I'm okay with Jews, but I just don't think there should be a Jewish state.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.760
It's like saying, I'm not anti-American, I just don't think there should be an America.

07:41.760 --> 07:48.400
That's basically what people are saying vis-a-vis anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.200
When you say anti-Zionism, you're saying the Jewish people don't have a right to have a

07:53.200 --> 08:05.200
state of their own. And that is a denial of a basic principle that I think completely

08:06.480 --> 08:13.120
unmasks what is involved here. Today, anti-Semitism is anti-Zionism. Those who oppose the Jewish

08:13.120 --> 08:18.160
people oppose the Jewish state. If we jump from human history to the

08:18.240 --> 08:25.760
current particular moment, there's protests in Israel now about the proposed judicial reform

08:26.480 --> 08:29.840
that gives power to your government to override the Supreme Court.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.960
So the critics say that this gives too much power to you, virtually making you a dictator.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.560
Well, that's ridiculous. The mere fact that you have so many demonstrations and protests,

08:41.200 --> 08:50.560
some dictatorship. There's a lot of democracy here, more ambunctious and more robust than

08:50.560 --> 08:54.720
just anywhere on the planet. Can you still man the case that this

08:54.720 --> 09:02.960
may give too much power to the coalition government, to the prime minister, not just to you,

09:02.960 --> 09:06.480
but to those who follow? No. I think that's complete hogwash

09:06.480 --> 09:12.560
because I think there's very few people who are demonstrating against this. Quite a few,

09:13.200 --> 09:18.080
quite many don't have an idea what is being discussed. They're basically being sloganized.

09:18.080 --> 09:25.280
You can sloganize something about not mass media right now, but the social network. You can

09:25.280 --> 09:32.960
basically feed deliberately with big data and big money. You can just feed slogans and get into

09:32.960 --> 09:37.520
people's minds. I'm sure you don't think I exaggerate because you can tell me more about

09:37.520 --> 09:44.080
that. And you can create mass mobilization based on these absurd slogans. So here's where I come

09:44.080 --> 09:48.160
from and what we're doing, what we're trying to do and what we've changed in what we're trying to

09:48.160 --> 09:59.760
do. I'm a 19th century Democrat in my views. I asked the question, what is democracy?

10:00.080 --> 10:06.960
Okay. So democracy is the will of the majority and the protection of the rights. They call it

10:06.960 --> 10:12.960
the rights of the minority, but I say the rights of the individual. Okay. So how do you balance the

10:12.960 --> 10:21.600
two? How do you avoid mobocracy? Okay. And how do you avoid dictatorship? The opposite side.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.200
The way you avoid it is something that was built essentially by British philosophers and

10:27.200 --> 10:33.200
French philosophers, but was encapsulated by the founding fathers of the United States.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.160
You create a balance between the three branches of government,

10:37.520 --> 10:43.840
the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary. And this balance is what assures the balance

10:43.840 --> 10:50.560
between majority rights and individual rights. And you have to balance all of them. Okay.

10:50.560 --> 10:59.360
That balance was maintained in Israel in its first 50 years and was gradually overtaken

10:59.360 --> 11:04.720
and basically broken by the most activist judicial court on the planet. That's what

11:04.720 --> 11:11.280
happened here. And gradually over the last two, three decades, the court

11:11.920 --> 11:17.280
arrogated for itself the powers of the parliament and the executive. So we're trying to bring it

11:17.280 --> 11:23.120
back into line. Bringing it back into line into what is common in all parliamentary democracies

11:23.120 --> 11:28.320
and in the United States doesn't mean taking the pendulum from one side and bringing it to the

11:28.320 --> 11:34.640
other side. We want checks and balances, not unrivaled power. Just as we said, we want an

11:34.640 --> 11:39.920
independent judiciary, but not an all-powerful judiciary. That balance does not mean bringing

11:39.920 --> 11:45.360
it back into line. It doesn't mean that you can have the parliament, our Knesset, override any

11:45.360 --> 11:51.040
decision that the Supreme Court does. So I pretty much early on said after the judicial

11:51.040 --> 11:58.560
reform was introduced, get rid of the idea of a sweeping override clause that would have with

11:58.560 --> 12:04.320
61 votes, that's majority of one, you can just nullify any Supreme Court decision. So let's move

12:04.320 --> 12:10.720
it back into the center. So that's gone. And most of the criticism on the judicial reform was based

12:10.880 --> 12:16.720
on an unlimited override clause, which I've said is simply not going to happen. People are

12:16.720 --> 12:21.280
discussing something that already for six months does not exist. The second point that

12:22.160 --> 12:28.320
we received criticism on was the structure of how do you choose Supreme Court judges,

12:28.320 --> 12:35.760
okay? How do you choose them? And the critics of the reform are saying that the idea

12:36.400 --> 12:41.360
that elected officials should choose Supreme Court judges is the end of democracy.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.440
If that's the case, the United States is not a democracy. Neither is France, and neither are

12:45.440 --> 12:51.600
just, I don't know, just about every democracy on the planet. So there is a view here that

12:52.240 --> 12:59.200
you can't have the sordid hands of elected officials involved in the choosing of judges.

12:59.200 --> 13:04.960
And in the Israeli system, the judicial activism went so far that effectively,

13:04.960 --> 13:14.080
the sitting judges have an effective veto on choosing judges, which means that this is a

13:14.080 --> 13:18.560
self-selecting court that just perpetrates itself. And we want to correct that. Again,

13:18.560 --> 13:23.120
want to correct it in a balanced way. And that's basically what we're trying to do. So I think

13:23.120 --> 13:28.880
there's a lot of misinformation about that. We're trying to bring Israeli democracy to where it was

13:28.880 --> 13:34.720
in its first 50 years. And it was a stellar democracy. It still is. Israel is a democracy,

13:34.720 --> 13:41.200
will remain a democracy, a vibrant democracy. And believe me, the fact that people are arguing and

13:41.200 --> 13:48.400
demonstrating in the streets and protesting is just the best proof of that. And that's how it'll

13:48.400 --> 13:55.760
remain. We spoke about tech companies offline. There's a lot of tech companies nervous about

13:55.760 --> 14:02.400
this judicial reform. Can you speak to why large and small companies have a future in Israel?

14:03.200 --> 14:08.480
Because Israel is a free market economy. I had something to do with that. I introduced dozens

14:08.480 --> 14:13.760
and dozens of free market reforms that made Israel move from $17,000 per capita income

14:15.200 --> 14:23.520
within a very short time to $54,000. That's nominal GDP per capita, according to the IMF.

14:23.520 --> 14:30.880
And we've overtaken in that Japan, France, Britain, Germany. How did that happen? Because

14:30.880 --> 14:36.560
we unleashed the genius that we have and the initiative and the entrepreneurship that is

14:37.120 --> 14:42.400
latent in our population. And to do that, we had to create free markets. So we created that.

14:42.400 --> 14:48.080
So Israel has one of the most vibrant free market economies in the world. And the second thing we

14:48.080 --> 14:54.640
have is a permanent investment in conceptual products because we have a permanent investment

14:57.280 --> 15:03.840
in the military and our security services, creating basically knowledge workers who then become

15:04.640 --> 15:09.440
knowledge entrepreneurs. And so we create this structure. And that's not going to go away.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.880
There's been a decline in investments in high tech globally. I think that's driven by many factors,

15:14.880 --> 15:20.880
but the most important one is the interest rate, which I think will fluctuate up and down.

15:20.880 --> 15:26.240
But Israel will remain a very attractive country because it produces so many,

15:26.960 --> 15:33.120
so many knowledge workers in a knowledge-based economy. And it's changing so rapidly. The world

15:33.120 --> 15:40.880
is changing. You're looking for the places that have innovation. The future belongs to those who

15:40.880 --> 15:48.720
innovate. Israel is the preeminent innovation nation. It has few competitors. And I would say,

15:48.720 --> 15:57.440
all right, where do you have this close cross-disciplinary fermentation of various

15:57.440 --> 16:01.600
skills and areas? I would say it's in Israel. And I'll tell you why. We used to be just telecoms

16:02.160 --> 16:07.760
because people went out of the military intelligence, RNSA. But that's been now

16:07.760 --> 16:14.960
broad-based. You find it in medicine. You find it in biology. You find it in agri-tech. You find

16:14.960 --> 16:20.640
it everywhere. Everything is becoming technologized. And in Israel, everybody is dealing in everything.

16:21.280 --> 16:28.960
And that's a potent reservoir of talent that the world is not going to pass up. And in fact,

16:28.960 --> 16:35.760
it's coming to us. We just had Nvidia coming here, and they decided to build a supercomputer in Israel.

16:35.760 --> 16:41.040
Wonder why. We've had Intel coming here and deciding now to invest $25 billion just now

16:42.480 --> 16:48.400
in a new plant in Israel. I wonder why. I don't wonder why. They know why. Because the talent

16:48.400 --> 16:54.160
is here, and the freedom is here. And it will remain so. So you had a conversation about AI

16:54.160 --> 17:00.640
with Sam Altman of OpenAI and with Elon Musk. Yeah. What was the content of that conversation?

17:00.640 --> 17:07.920
What's your vision for this very highest of tech, which is artificial intelligence?

17:08.800 --> 17:11.360
Well, first of all, I have a high regard for the people I talk to.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.960
And I understand that they understand things I don't understand. And I don't pretend to

17:16.960 --> 17:24.080
understand everything. But I do understand one thing. I understand that AI is developing at a

17:24.080 --> 17:31.840
geometric rate. And in political life and in life in general, people don't have an intuitive grasp

17:31.840 --> 17:39.120
of geometric growth. You understand things basically in linear increments. And the idea

17:39.120 --> 17:44.560
that you're coming up a ski slope is very foreign to people. So they don't understand it. And they're

17:44.640 --> 17:51.120
naturally also taken aback about it. Because what do you do?

17:52.640 --> 17:59.840
So I think there are several conclusions from my conversations with them and from my other

17:59.840 --> 18:04.320
observations that I've been talking about for many years. I'm talking about the need to do this.

18:04.960 --> 18:11.040
Well, the first thing is this. There is no possibility of not entering AI with full force.

18:11.120 --> 18:15.920
Secondly, there is a need for regulation. Third, it's not clear there will be global

18:15.920 --> 18:22.800
regulation. Fourth, it's not clear where it ends up. I certainly cannot say that. Now, you might

18:22.800 --> 18:29.200
say, does it come to control us? Okay, that's a question. Does it come to control us? I don't

18:30.160 --> 18:43.360
know the answer to that. I think that as one observation that I have from these conversations

18:44.400 --> 18:50.080
is if it does come to control us, that's probably the only chance of having universal regulation

18:50.080 --> 19:02.880
because I don't see anyone deciding to avoid the race and cooperate unless you have that threat.

19:03.440 --> 19:08.640
Doesn't mean you can't regulate AI within countries even without that understanding.

19:08.640 --> 19:12.080
But it does mean that there is a limit to regulation because every country will want

19:12.080 --> 19:17.680
to make sure that it doesn't give up competitive advantage if there is no universal regulation.

19:18.400 --> 19:26.960
I think that right now, just as 10 years ago, I read a novel. I don't read novels, but I was

19:26.960 --> 19:33.440
forced to read one by a scientific advisor. I read history. I read about economics. I read

19:33.440 --> 19:40.400
about technology. I just don't read novels. Okay. On this, I follow Churchill. He said,

19:40.400 --> 19:46.160
fact is better than fiction. Well, this fiction would become fact. And it was a book. It was a

19:46.160 --> 19:53.760
novel about a Chinese-American future cyber war. And I read the book in one sitting,

19:54.960 --> 20:01.440
called in a team of experts, and I said, all right, let's turn Israel into one of the world's five

20:01.440 --> 20:05.520
cyber powers and let's do it very quickly. And we did, actually. We did exactly that.

20:06.960 --> 20:13.760
I think AI is bigger than that and related to that because it'll affect, well, cyber affects

20:13.760 --> 20:18.160
everything, but AI will affect it even more fundamentally. And the joining of the two could

20:18.160 --> 20:25.120
be very powerful. So I think in Israel, we have to do it anyway for security reasons and we're

20:25.120 --> 20:35.920
doing it. But I think what about our databases that are already very robust on the medical records of

20:35.920 --> 20:41.440
98% of our population? Why don't we stick a genetic database on that? Why don't we do other

20:41.440 --> 20:50.400
things that could bring magical, what are seemingly magical cures and drugs and medical

20:50.400 --> 20:56.640
instruments for that? That's one possibility. We have it in, as I said, in every single field.

20:56.640 --> 21:02.480
The conclusion is this. We have to move on AI. We are moving on AI just as we moved on cyber.

21:02.480 --> 21:09.920
And I think Israel will be one of the leading AI powers in the world.

21:10.480 --> 21:16.560
The questions I don't have an answer to is, where does it go? How much does it eat, chew up on

21:17.200 --> 21:25.040
jobs? There's an assumption that I'm not sure is true, that all previous, the two big

21:26.880 --> 21:32.560
previous revolutions in the human condition, namely the agricultural revolution and the

21:32.560 --> 21:42.560
industrial revolution, definitely produce more jobs than they consumed. That is not obvious to

21:42.560 --> 21:48.880
me at all. I could see new jobs creating and yes, I have that comforting statement.

21:49.840 --> 21:55.360
But it's not quite true because I think on balance, they'll probably consume more jobs,

21:55.360 --> 21:58.800
many more jobs than they'll create. At least in the short term.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.520
And we don't know about the long term.

22:01.520 --> 22:05.440
I don't know about the long term, but I used to have the comfort, being a free market guy,

22:05.440 --> 22:11.360
I always said, we're going to produce more jobs and by limiting certain government jobs,

22:11.360 --> 22:14.960
we're actually putting out in the market, we'll create more jobs, which obviously happened.

22:15.760 --> 22:22.880
We had one telecom company, a government company, when I said we're going to create competition,

22:22.880 --> 22:26.800
they said, you're going to run us out. We're not going to have more workers. Yeah, they had

22:26.800 --> 22:32.560
13,000 workers, they went down to seven, but we created another 40,000 in the other companies.

22:32.560 --> 22:37.600
So that was a comforting thought. I always knew that was true. Not only that, I also knew that

22:37.600 --> 22:43.200
wealth would spread by opening up the markets completely opposite to the socialist and

22:43.200 --> 22:48.000
semi-socialist creed that they had here. They said, you're going to make the rich richer and

22:48.000 --> 22:53.600
the poor, poor, no, and made everyone richer. And actually, the people who entered the job market

22:53.600 --> 23:03.760
because of the reforms we did actually became a lot richer on the lower ladders of the socio-economic

23:04.480 --> 23:11.120
measure. But here's the point. I don't know, I don't know that we will not have

23:12.320 --> 23:17.760
what Elon Musk calls the end of scarcity. So you'll have the end of scarcity, you'll have

23:17.760 --> 23:24.240
enormous productivity. Very few people are producing enormous added value.

23:25.520 --> 23:30.880
You're going to have to tax that to pass it to the others. You're going to have to do that.

23:30.880 --> 23:35.520
That's a political question. I'm not sure how we answer that. What if you tax and somebody

23:35.520 --> 23:40.160
else doesn't tax, you're going to get everybody to go there. That's an issue, an international

23:40.160 --> 23:46.720
issue that we constantly have to deal with. And the second question you have is, suppose you

23:46.720 --> 23:58.560
solve that problem and you deliver money to those who are not involved in the AI economy.

23:59.440 --> 24:05.120
What do they do? The first question you ask somebody whom you just met after the polite

24:06.880 --> 24:12.240
exchanges is, what do you do? Well, people define themselves by their profession.

24:13.200 --> 24:18.960
And it's going to be difficult if you don't have a profession. And people will spend more time

24:18.960 --> 24:26.080
self-searching, more time in the arts, more time in leisure. I understand that. If I have to bet

24:26.880 --> 24:33.760
it will annihilate many more jobs than it will create and will force a structural change in our

24:33.760 --> 24:40.240
economics, in our economic models, and in our politics. And I'm not sure where it's going to

24:40.240 --> 24:46.240
go. And that's something we have to respond to at the nation level and just as a human civilization,

24:46.240 --> 24:52.400
both the threat of AI to just us as a human species and then the effect on the jobs

24:53.040 --> 24:58.880
and, like you said, cybersecurity. And what do you think? You think we're going to lose control?

25:00.000 --> 25:05.040
No. First of all, I do believe maybe naively that it will create more jobs than it takes.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.840
Write that down and we'll check it. It's on record. And you know, we don't say we'll check

25:09.840 --> 25:14.080
it after our lifetime. No, we'll see it in a few years. We'll see it in a few years. I'm really

25:14.080 --> 25:20.720
concerned about cybersecurity and the nature of how that changes with the power of AI. And in

25:20.720 --> 25:26.960
terms of existential threats, I think there will be so much threats that aren't existential along

25:26.960 --> 25:33.840
the way that that's the thing I'm mostly concerned about versus AI taking complete control and

25:33.840 --> 25:38.400
becoming sort of superseding the human species. Although that is something you should consider

25:38.400 --> 25:44.640
seriously because of the exponential growth of its capabilities. It's exactly the exponential

25:44.640 --> 25:51.360
growth which we understand is before us, but we don't really, it's very hard to project forward.

25:51.360 --> 25:58.880
To really understand. That's right. Exactly right. So I deal with what I can and where I can

25:58.880 --> 26:04.480
affect something. I tend not to worry about things I don't control because at a certain point,

26:05.200 --> 26:10.080
there's no point. I mean, you have to decide what you're spending your time on. So I think

26:10.640 --> 26:18.320
in practical terms, I think we'll make Israel a formidable AI power. We understand the limitation

26:18.320 --> 26:24.560
of scale, computing power and other things. But I think within those limits, I think we can

26:26.480 --> 26:33.520
make here this miracle that we did in many other things. We do more with less. I don't

26:33.520 --> 26:37.280
care if it's water, the production of water or the production of energy or the production of

26:37.280 --> 26:45.120
knowledge or the production of cyber capabilities, defense and other. We just do more with less.

26:45.120 --> 26:52.080
And I think in AI, we're going to do a lot more with relatively small but highly gifted population.

26:52.080 --> 26:59.520
Very gifted. So taking a small tangent, as we talked about offline, you have a background in

26:59.520 --> 27:06.960
taekwondo. We mentioned Elon Musk. I've trained with both. This is a quick question. Who are you

27:06.960 --> 27:13.360
betting on in a fight? Well, I refuse to answer that. I will say this.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.400
Such a politician you are. Yeah, of course. Here I'm a politician.

27:16.400 --> 27:25.280
I'm openly telling you that I'm dodging the question. But I'll say this. I spent five years

27:25.280 --> 27:32.320
in our special forces in the military and we barely spent a minute on martial arts.

27:33.120 --> 27:41.040
I actually learned taekwondo later when I came to – it wasn't even at MIT. At MIT, I think I did

27:41.040 --> 27:45.520
karate. But when I came to the UN, I had a martial arts expert and he taught me taekwondo,

27:45.520 --> 27:50.320
which was kind of interesting. Now, the question you really have to ask is why did we learn

27:50.960 --> 27:59.280
martial arts in this special elite unit? And the answer is there's no point. If you saw Indiana

27:59.280 --> 28:08.160
Jones, there's no point. Just pull the trigger. That's simple. Now, I don't expect anyone to pull

28:08.160 --> 28:12.960
the trigger on this combat and I'm sure you'll make sure that doesn't happen.

28:15.040 --> 28:19.440
Yeah. I mean, martial arts is kind of – it's bigger than just combat. It's this kind of

28:19.440 --> 28:26.320
journey of humility and it has – it's an art form. It truly is an art. But it's fascinating

28:26.320 --> 28:32.400
these two figures in tech are facing each other. And I won't ask a question of who you would face

28:32.400 --> 28:37.120
and how you would do, but – Well, I'm facing opponents all the time.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.240
All the time? Yeah. That's part of life. But not of each.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.600
Part of life is – Not yet.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.400
I'm not sure about that. Are you announcing invites?

28:44.960 --> 28:54.480
Part of life is competition. The only time competition ends is death. But political life,

28:54.480 --> 29:01.040
economic life, cultural life is engaged continuously in creativity and competition.

29:03.040 --> 29:08.880
The problem I have with that, as I mentioned earlier just before we began the podcast,

29:08.880 --> 29:18.160
is that at a certain point, you want to put barriers to monopoly. And if you're a really

29:18.160 --> 29:22.320
able competitor, you're going to create a monopoly. That's what Peter Thiel says

29:22.880 --> 29:28.160
is a natural course of things. It's what I learned basically in the Boston Consulting Group.

29:28.160 --> 29:33.280
If you're a very able competitor, you'll create scale advantages that give you the ability to

29:33.280 --> 29:37.600
lock out your competition. And as a prime minister, I want to assure that there is

29:37.600 --> 29:43.440
competition in the markets. You have to limit this competitive power at a certain point.

29:43.440 --> 29:49.360
And that becomes increasingly hard in a world where everything is intermixed. Where do you

29:49.360 --> 29:57.120
define market segments? Where do you define monopoly? How do you do that? That is very –

29:57.120 --> 30:02.400
that actually, conceptually, I find very challenging. Because of all the dozens of

30:02.400 --> 30:08.720
political – of economic reforms that I've made, the most difficult part is the conceptual part.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.160
Once you have – you've ironed it out. You say, here's what I want to do. Here's the

30:12.160 --> 30:16.960
right thing to do. Then you have a practical problem of overcoming union resistance,

30:16.960 --> 30:26.560
political resistance, press calumny, opponents from this or that corner. That's a practical

30:26.560 --> 30:33.920
matter. But if you have it conceptually defined, you can move ahead to reform economies or reform

30:34.560 --> 30:44.240
education or reform transportation. Fine. In the question of the growing power of large companies,

30:45.120 --> 30:49.040
big tech companies, to monopolize the markets because they're better at it,

30:49.040 --> 30:56.160
they provide a service, they provide a lower cost, a rapidly declining cost. Where do you stop? Where

30:57.120 --> 31:03.520
do you stop monopoly power is a crucial question because it also becomes now a political question.

31:03.520 --> 31:07.760
If you amass enormous amount of economic power, which is information power,

31:09.360 --> 31:14.480
that also monopolizes the political process, which creates – these are real questions

31:14.480 --> 31:19.360
that are not obvious. I don't have an obvious answer. Because as I said, as a 19th century

31:19.360 --> 31:25.200
Democrat, these are questions of the 21st century which people should begin to think,

31:25.200 --> 31:30.400
do you have a solution to that? The solution of monopolies growing arbitrarily,

31:30.960 --> 31:36.080
unstoppably in power. In economic power and therefore in political power.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.520
Some of that is regulation. Some of that is competition.

31:40.560 --> 31:47.600
You know where to draw the line? It's not breaking up AT&T. It's not that simple.

31:49.120 --> 31:54.240
Well, I believe in the power of competition that there will always be somebody that challenges the

31:54.240 --> 32:00.400
big guys. Especially in the space of AI, the more open source movements are taking hold,

32:00.400 --> 32:04.480
the more the little guy can become the big guy. So you're saying basically the regulatory

32:06.320 --> 32:13.280
instrument is the market? In large part, in most part. That's the hope. Maybe I'm a dreamer.

32:13.280 --> 32:20.800
That's been in many ways my policy up to now. The best regulator is the market,

32:20.800 --> 32:29.440
the best regulator in economic activity is the market, and the best regulator in political

32:29.440 --> 32:35.600
matters is the political market. That's called elections. That's what regulates. You have a

32:35.600 --> 32:44.320
lousy government and people make lousy decisions. Well, you don't need the wise men raised above

32:44.320 --> 32:51.840
the masses to decide what is good and what is bad. Let the masses decide. Let them vote every

32:51.840 --> 32:56.320
four years or whatever and they throw you up. By the way, it happened to me. There's life after

32:56.320 --> 33:01.520
political death. There's actually political life. I was reelected five or six times and this is my

33:01.520 --> 33:11.120
sixth term. I believe in that. I'm not sure. I'm not sure that in economic matters, in the geometric

33:11.120 --> 33:18.720
growth of tech companies, that you'll always have the little guy, the nimble mammal that will come

33:18.720 --> 33:24.960
out and slay the dinosaurs or overcome the dinosaurs, which is essentially what you said.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.360
Yeah. I wouldn't count out the little guy.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.840
You wouldn't count out the little guy. Well, I hope you're right.

33:32.000 --> 33:38.400
Let me ask you about this market of politics. You have served six terms as prime minister

33:38.400 --> 33:45.040
over 15 years in power. Let me ask you again, human nature. Do you worry about the corrupting

33:45.040 --> 33:48.000
nature of power on you as a leader, on you as a man?

33:48.000 --> 33:58.000
Not at all, because I think that, again, the thing that drives me is nothing but the mission

33:58.000 --> 34:06.160
that I took to assure the survival and thriving of the state, the Jewish state. That is, it's

34:06.160 --> 34:12.160
economic prosperity, but it's security and its ability to achieve peace with our neighbors,

34:12.160 --> 34:17.360
and I'm committed to it. I think there are many things that have been done. There are

34:18.640 --> 34:23.440
a few big things that I can still do, but it doesn't only depend on my sense of mission. It

34:23.440 --> 34:29.040
depends on the market, as we say. It depends really on the will of the Israeli voters,

34:29.040 --> 34:33.600
and the Israeli voters have decided to vote for me again and again, even though I wield

34:33.600 --> 34:44.560
no power in the press, no power in many quarters here, and so on. Nothing. I'm going to be very

34:44.560 --> 34:49.600
soon the longest-serving prime minister in the last half century in the Western democracies,

34:50.240 --> 34:56.560
but that's not because I amass great political power in any of the institutions.

34:57.520 --> 35:04.560
I had a conversation with Silvio Berlusconi, who recently died, and he said to me about,

35:05.520 --> 35:15.680
I don't know, 15 years ago, something like that. He said, so, Bibi, how many of Israel's

35:17.680 --> 35:23.200
television stations do you have? And I said, none. He said, do you have none?

35:23.200 --> 35:24.240
Do you have?

35:24.800 --> 35:32.400
I said, none. I have two. He said, no, no, but you don't have any that you control. I said,

35:32.400 --> 35:36.720
not only do I have none that I control, they're all against me. So he said, so how do you win

35:36.720 --> 35:43.680
elections with both hands tied behind your back? And I said, the hard way. That's why I have

35:44.240 --> 35:49.840
the largest party, but I don't have many more seats that I would have if I had a sympathetic

35:50.560 --> 35:55.120
voice in the media. And Israel is, until recently, was dominated completely by

35:56.000 --> 36:04.640
one side of the political spectrum that often vilified me. Not me, because they viewed me as

36:04.640 --> 36:08.480
representing basically the conservative voices in Israel that are a majority.

36:09.600 --> 36:19.680
So the idea that I'm an omnipotent authoritarian dictator is ridiculous. I would say I'm not merely

36:20.160 --> 36:29.440
a champion of democracy and democratization. I believe ultimately the decision is with the

36:29.440 --> 36:38.640
voters. And the voters, even though they have constant press attacks, they have chosen to put

36:38.640 --> 36:43.920
me back in. So I don't believe in this thing of amassing the corrupting power. If you don't have

36:43.920 --> 36:53.200
elections, if you control the means of influencing the voters, I understand what you're saying. But

36:53.200 --> 36:59.360
in my case, it's the exact opposite. I have to constantly go in elections, constantly with a

36:59.360 --> 37:08.400
disadvantage that the major media outlets are very violently sometimes against me. But it's fine,

37:08.400 --> 37:12.320
and I keep on winning. So I don't know what you're talking about. I would say the concentration of

37:12.320 --> 37:18.560
power lies elsewhere, not here. Well, you have been involved in several corruption cases. How

37:18.560 --> 37:23.120
much corruption is there in Israel? And how do you fight it in your own party and in Israel?

37:24.000 --> 37:27.200
Well, you should ask a different question. What's happened to these cases? These cases

37:28.720 --> 37:38.480
basically are collapsing. And before our eyes, there was recently an event in which the judges,

37:38.480 --> 37:42.080
the three judges in my case, called in the prosecution and said,

37:42.880 --> 37:49.360
your flagship, the bribery charge, so-called bribery charge is gone, doesn't exist.

37:49.360 --> 38:02.240
Before a single defense witness was called. And it sort of tells you that this thing is evaporating.

38:02.240 --> 38:07.360
It's quite astounding. Even that, I have to say, was covered even by the mainstream press

38:08.080 --> 38:13.440
in Israel because it's such an earthquake. So a lot of these charges are, not a lot,

38:13.440 --> 38:18.400
these charges will prove to be nothing. I always said, listen, I stand before the legal process.

38:18.400 --> 38:24.800
I don't claim that I'm exempt from it in any way. On the contrary, I think the truth will come out,

38:24.800 --> 38:28.720
and it's coming out. And we see that not only with that, but with other things.

38:28.720 --> 38:35.280
So I think it's kind of instructive that no politician has been more vilified,

38:35.600 --> 38:44.240
none has been put to such a, what is it, about a quarter of a billion shekels were used to

38:44.240 --> 38:51.120
scrutinize me, scour my bank accounts, sending people to the Philippines, into Mexico, into

38:51.120 --> 38:56.400
Europe, into America, and looking at everybody using spyware, the most advanced spyware on the

38:56.400 --> 39:04.720
planet against my associates, blackmailing witnesses, telling them, think about your family,

39:04.720 --> 39:09.040
think about your wife, you better tell us what you want. All that is coming out of the trial.

39:10.000 --> 39:17.600
So I would say that most people now are not asking, are no longer asking, including my

39:17.600 --> 39:22.960
opponents, sort of trickling in as the stuff comes out. People are not saying,

39:23.600 --> 39:30.080
what did Netanyahu do because he apparently did nothing? What was done to him is something

39:30.080 --> 39:37.520
the people ask. What was done to our democracy? What was done in the attempt to put down somebody

39:37.520 --> 39:45.600
who keeps winning elections despite the handicaps that I described? Maybe we can nail him by framing

39:45.600 --> 39:52.400
him. And the one thing I can say about this court trial is that things are coming out,

39:52.400 --> 39:58.240
and that's very good. Just objective things are coming out, changing the picture. So I would say

39:59.040 --> 40:06.080
the attempt to brand me as corrupt is falling on its face, but the thing that is being uncovered

40:06.080 --> 40:17.600
in the trial, such as the use of spyware on a politician, a politician's surroundings,

40:17.600 --> 40:26.480
to try to shake them down in investigations, put them in flea-ridden cells for 21 days,

40:27.200 --> 40:35.200
invite their 84-year-old mother to investigations without cause, bringing in their mistresses in

40:35.200 --> 40:42.400
the corridor, shaking them down. That's what people are asking. That corruption is what they want

40:42.400 --> 40:51.520
corrected. What is the top obstacle to peaceful coexistence of Israelis and Palestinians?

40:51.520 --> 40:54.640
Let's talk about the big question of peace in this part of the world.

40:54.640 --> 41:03.920
Mm hmm. Well, I think the reason you have the persistence of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,

41:03.920 --> 41:10.400
which goes back about a century, is the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize

41:11.120 --> 41:16.320
a Jewish state, a nation state for the Jewish people in any boundary. That's why they opposed

41:16.960 --> 41:21.200
the establishment of the state of Israel before we had a state, and that's why they've opposed it

41:21.200 --> 41:27.280
after we had a state. They opposed it when we didn't have Judea and Samaria, the West Bank in

41:27.280 --> 41:31.440
our heads and Gaza, and they opposed it after we had it. It doesn't make a difference. It's basically

41:31.440 --> 41:37.840
the persistent refusal to recognize a Jewish state in any boundaries. And I think their tragedy is

41:37.840 --> 41:43.200
that they've been commandeered for a century by leadership that refused to compromise with the

41:43.200 --> 41:50.240
idea of Zionism, namely that the Jews deserve a state in this part of the world. The territorial

41:50.240 --> 41:55.280
dispute is something else. You have a territorial dispute if you say, okay, you're living on this

41:55.280 --> 41:59.520
side, we're living on that side, let's decide where the border is, and so on. That's not what

41:59.520 --> 42:10.000
the argument is. The Palestinian society, which is itself fragmented, but all the factions agree

42:10.000 --> 42:15.440
there shouldn't be a Jewish state anyway, okay? They just disagree between Hamas that says,

42:15.440 --> 42:22.320
oh, well, you should have it. We should get rid of it with terror. And the others are saying,

42:22.320 --> 42:28.480
no, we should also use political means to dissolve it. So that is the problem.

42:28.480 --> 42:32.160
So even as part of a two-state solution, they're still against the idea.

42:32.960 --> 42:38.080
Well, they don't want a state next to Israel. They want a state instead of Israel. And they say,

42:38.080 --> 42:43.840
if we get a state, we'll use it as a springboard to destroy the smaller Israeli state, which is

42:43.840 --> 42:48.640
what happened when Israel unilaterally walked out of Gaza and effectively established a Hamas

42:48.640 --> 42:54.160
state there. They didn't say, oh, good, now we have our own territory, our own state. Israel is

42:54.160 --> 43:02.480
no longer there. Let's build peace. Let's build economic projects. Let's enfranchise our people.

43:02.480 --> 43:09.520
No, they turned it basically into a terror bastion from which they fired 10,000 rockets into Israel.

43:09.520 --> 43:19.200
When Israel left Lebanon because we had terrorist attacks from there, then we had Lebanon taken

43:19.200 --> 43:24.320
over by Hezbollah, a terrorist organization that seeks to destroy Israel. And therefore,

43:24.320 --> 43:31.760
every time we just walked out, what we got was not peace. We didn't give territory for peace.

43:31.760 --> 43:37.920
We got territory for terror. That's what we had. And that's what would happen as long as the reigning

43:37.920 --> 43:45.360
ideology says we don't want Israel in any border. So the idea of two states assumes that you'd have

43:45.360 --> 43:50.240
on the other side a state that wants to live in peace and not one that will be overtaken by Iran

43:50.240 --> 43:55.440
and its proxies in two seconds and become a base to destroy Israel. And therefore, I think that

43:55.440 --> 44:03.280
most Israelis today, if you ask them, they'd say it's not going to work in that concept.

44:03.280 --> 44:08.960
So what do you do with the Palestinians? They're still there. And unlike them,

44:08.960 --> 44:13.680
I don't want to throw them out. They're going to be living here and we're going to be living

44:13.680 --> 44:20.000
here in an area which is, by the way, just so you understand, the area, the entire area of

44:21.120 --> 44:26.880
so-called West Bank and Israel is the width of the Washington Beltway more or less, just a little

44:26.880 --> 44:31.920
more, not much more. You can't really divide it up. You can't say, well, you're going to fly in.

44:31.920 --> 44:37.600
Who controls the airspace? Well, it takes you about two and a half minutes to cross it with a

44:38.800 --> 44:46.880
regular, you know, 747, okay? With a fighter plane, it takes you a minute and a half, okay?

44:46.880 --> 44:50.960
So how are you going to divide the airspace? Well, you're not going to divide it. Israel's

44:50.960 --> 44:57.280
going to control that airspace and the electromagnetic space and so on. So security has

44:57.280 --> 45:06.400
to be in the hands of Israel. My view of how you solve this problem is a simple principle.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.960
The Palestinians should have all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers

45:10.960 --> 45:16.400
to threaten Israel, which basically means that the responsibility for overall security remains

45:16.400 --> 45:21.040
with Israel. And from a practical point of view, we've seen that every time that Israel

45:21.520 --> 45:28.880
leaves a territory and takes its security forces out of an area, it immediately is overtaken

45:28.880 --> 45:36.000
by Hamas or Hezbollah or jihadists who basically are committed to the destruction of Israel and

45:36.000 --> 45:42.720
also bring misery to the Palestinians or Arab subjects. So I think that that principle

45:43.440 --> 45:48.720
is less than perfect sovereignty because you're taking a certain amount of power,

45:48.800 --> 45:53.920
sovereign powers, especially security away, but I think it's the only practical solution.

45:53.920 --> 45:58.400
So people say, ah, but it's not a perfect state. I said, okay, call it what you will, call it,

45:58.400 --> 46:04.160
you know, I don't know, limited sovereignty, call it autonomy plus, call it whatever you

46:04.160 --> 46:09.120
want to call it. But that's the reality. And right now, if you ask Israelis across the political

46:09.120 --> 46:14.640
spectrum, except the very hard left, most Israelis agree with that. They don't really debate it.

46:14.640 --> 46:18.240
So a two-state solution where Israel controls the security of the entire region?

46:18.720 --> 46:22.240
We don't call it quite that. I mean, there are different names, but the idea is yes,

46:22.240 --> 46:28.400
Israel controls security in the entire area. It's this tiny area between the Jordan River and the

46:28.400 --> 46:34.000
sea. I mean, it's like, you know, you can walk it in not one afternoon. If you're really fit,

46:34.000 --> 46:38.400
you can do it in a day, less than a day. I did.

46:39.440 --> 46:45.040
So the expansion of settlements in the West Bank has been a top priority for this new government.

46:45.760 --> 46:52.320
So people may harshly criticize this as contributing to escalating the Israel-Palestine

46:52.320 --> 46:58.240
tensions. Can you understand that perspective that this expansion of settlements is not good

46:58.240 --> 47:01.760
for this two-state solution? Yeah, I can understand what they're

47:01.760 --> 47:07.760
saying and they don't understand why they're wrong. First, most Israelis who live in Judea

47:07.760 --> 47:14.800
Samaria live in urban blocks, and that accounts for about 90% of the population.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.960
Everybody recognizes that those urban blocks are going to be part of Israel in any future

47:20.960 --> 47:25.920
arrangement. So they're really arguing about something that has already been decided and

47:25.920 --> 47:32.880
agreed upon really by Americans, even by Arabs, many Arabs. They don't think that Israel is going

47:32.880 --> 47:38.000
to dismantle these blocks. You know, you look outside the window here, and within about a

47:38.000 --> 47:45.920
kilometer, a mile from here, is you have Jerusalem. Half of Jerusalem grew naturally beyond the old

47:45.920 --> 47:51.280
1967 border. So you're not going to dismantle half of Jerusalem. That's not going to happen.

47:52.800 --> 47:59.200
And most people don't expect that. Then you have the other 10% scattered in tiny, you know,

47:59.200 --> 48:06.000
small communities, and people say, well, you're going to have to take them out. Why? Why? Remember

48:06.000 --> 48:12.800
that in pre-1967 Israel, we have over a million and a half Arabs here. We don't say, oh, Israel

48:12.800 --> 48:20.560
has to be ethnically cleansed from its Arab citizens in order to have peace. Of course not.

48:20.560 --> 48:26.400
Jews can live among Arabs and Arabs can live among Jews. And what is being advanced by those

48:26.400 --> 48:32.480
people who say that we can't live in our ancestral homeland in these disputed areas. Nobody says that

48:32.480 --> 48:37.360
this is Palestinian areas, and nobody says that these are Israeli areas. We claim them. They claim

48:37.360 --> 48:44.560
them. We've only been attached to this land for, oh, 3,500 years. But, you know, but it's a dispute.

48:44.560 --> 48:50.480
I agree. But I don't agree that we should throw out the Arabs, and I don't think that they should

48:50.480 --> 48:54.720
throw out the Jews. And if somebody said to you, the only way we're going to have peace with Israel

48:54.720 --> 49:01.120
is to have an ethnically cleansed Palestinian entity, you know, that's outrageous if you said

49:01.120 --> 49:07.280
the only way you shouldn't have Jews living in, I don't know, in suburbs of London or New York

49:07.280 --> 49:12.720
and so on. I don't think that will play too well. The world is actually advancing a solution that

49:12.720 --> 49:19.040
says that Jews cannot live among Arabs and Arabs cannot live among Jews. I don't think that's the

49:19.040 --> 49:25.040
right way to do it. And I think there's a solution out there, but I don't think we're going to get

49:25.040 --> 49:31.520
to it, which is less than perfect sovereignty, which involves Israeli security maintained for

49:32.160 --> 49:37.440
the entire territory by Israel, which involves not rooting out anybody, not kicking out,

49:37.440 --> 49:42.960
uprooting Arabs or Palestinians. They're going to live in enclaves in sovereign Israel, and we're

49:42.960 --> 49:48.800
going to live in probably in enclaves there, probably through transportational continuity

49:48.800 --> 49:53.920
as opposed to territorial continuity. That is, you know, for example, you can have tunnels and

49:53.920 --> 49:58.000
overpasses and so on that connect the various communities. And we're doing that right now.

49:58.720 --> 50:03.920
We're doing that right now. And it actually works. I think there is a solution to this.

50:04.720 --> 50:10.240
It's not the perfect world that people think of, because that model, I think, doesn't apply here.

50:10.960 --> 50:17.600
If it applies elsewhere, it's a question. I don't think so. But I think there's one other thing,

50:18.320 --> 50:22.720
and that's the main thing that I've been involved in. You know, people said,

50:22.720 --> 50:27.200
if you don't solve the Palestinian problem, you're not going to get to the Arab world. You're not

50:27.200 --> 50:32.000
going to have peace with the Arab world. Remember, the Palestinians are about 2% of the Arab world,

50:33.040 --> 50:38.480
and the other 98%, you're not going to make peace with them, and that's our goal.

50:39.440 --> 50:44.240
And for a long time, people accepted that after the initial peace treaties with Egypt,

50:44.240 --> 50:50.400
with Prime Minister Begin of the Likud and President Sadat of Egypt, and then with Jordan

50:51.280 --> 50:56.960
between Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein. For a quarter of a century, we didn't have any

50:56.960 --> 51:00.560
more peace treaties because people said, you've got to go through the Palestinians. And the

51:00.560 --> 51:05.760
Palestinians, they don't want a solution of the kind that I described or any kind except the one

51:05.760 --> 51:10.000
that involved the dissolution of the state of Israel, so we could wait another half century.

51:10.640 --> 51:16.080
And I said, no. I mean, I don't think that we should accept the premise that we have to

51:16.080 --> 51:21.280
wait for the Palestinians because we'll have to wait forever. So I decided to do it differently.

51:21.280 --> 51:28.000
I decided to go directly to the Arab capitals and to make the historic Abraham Accords,

51:28.880 --> 51:35.040
and essentially reversing the equation, not a peace process that goes inside out

51:36.320 --> 51:44.000
but outside in. And we went directly to these countries and forged these breakthrough

51:44.000 --> 51:49.040
peace accords with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain, with Morocco, and with Sudan,

51:49.760 --> 51:55.920
and we're now trying to expand that in a quantum leap with Saudi Arabia.

51:55.920 --> 52:00.800
What does it take to do that with Saudi Arabia, with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman?

52:01.440 --> 52:07.600
You know, I'm a student of history, and I read a lot of history, and I read that in the Versailles

52:08.320 --> 52:15.600
discussions after World War I, President Woodrow Wilson said, I believe in open covenants

52:15.600 --> 52:21.680
openly arrived at. I have my correction. I believed in open covenants secretly arrived at.

52:21.680 --> 52:27.600
So we're not going to advance a Saudi-Israeli peace by having it publicly discussed. And in

52:27.600 --> 52:34.960
any case, it's a decision of the Saudis if they want to do it, but there's obviously a mutual

52:34.960 --> 52:42.320
interest. So here's my view. If we try to wait for the 2% in order to get to the 98%, we're

52:42.320 --> 52:48.000
going to fail, and we have failed. If we go to the 98%, we have a much greater chance of persuading

52:48.000 --> 52:55.840
the 2%. You know why? Because the 2%, the Palestinian hope to vanquish the State of Israel

52:55.840 --> 53:01.200
and not make peace with it is based, among other things, on the assumption that eventually the

53:01.200 --> 53:06.880
98% of the rest of the Arab world will kick in and destroy the Jewish state, help them dissolve

53:06.880 --> 53:16.480
or destroy the Jewish state. When that hope is taken away, then you begin to have a turn to the

53:16.480 --> 53:21.280
realistic solutions of coexistence. By the way, they'll require compromise on the Israeli side,

53:21.760 --> 53:28.240
and I'm perfectly cognizant of that and willing to do that. But I think a realistic compromise

53:28.800 --> 53:35.680
will be struck much more readily when the conflict between Israel and the Arab states,

53:35.680 --> 53:40.480
the Arab world is effectively solved. And I think we're on that path. It was a conceptual change,

53:40.480 --> 53:46.000
just like I've been involved in a few. I told you, the conceptual battle is always

53:46.000 --> 53:52.400
the most difficult one. And I had to fight this battle to convert a semi-socialist state into

53:53.920 --> 53:58.400
a free market capitalist state. And I have to say that most people today recognize the power

53:58.400 --> 54:04.240
of competition and the benefits of free markets. So we also had to fight this battle that said,

54:04.240 --> 54:15.120
you have to go through the Palestinian straight, S-T-R-A-I-T, to get to the other places. There's

54:15.120 --> 54:23.120
no way to avoid this. You have to go through this impassable pass. And I think that now people are

54:23.120 --> 54:30.240
recognizing that we'll go around it and probably circle back. And that I think actually gives hope

54:30.240 --> 54:36.560
not only to have an Arab-Israeli peace, but circling back an Israeli-Palestinian peace.

54:36.560 --> 54:40.880
And obviously, this is not something that you find in the soundbites and so on,

54:41.360 --> 54:47.360
but in the popular discussion of the press. But that idea is permeating. And I think it's

54:47.360 --> 54:49.600
the right idea because I think it's the only one that will work.

54:49.600 --> 54:58.160
R. So expanding the circle piece, just to linger on that, requires what? Secretly talking man to man,

54:58.160 --> 55:01.680
human to human, to leaders of other nations.

55:01.680 --> 55:04.000
B. Theoretically, you're right.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.440
R. Theoretically. Okay. Well, let me ask you another theoretical question.

55:10.960 --> 55:18.720
On the circle of peace, as a student of history, looking at the ideas of war and peace,

55:18.720 --> 55:25.040
what do you think can achieve peace in the war in Ukraine? Looking at another part of the world,

55:26.880 --> 55:32.480
if you consider the fight for peace in this part of the world, how can you apply that

55:33.120 --> 55:36.000
to that other part of the world between Russia and Ukraine now?

55:36.880 --> 55:45.440
B. I think it's one of the savage horrors of history and one of the great tragedies that is

55:45.440 --> 55:58.720
occurring. And let me say in advance that if I have any opportunity to use my contacts to help

55:58.720 --> 56:07.440
bring about an end to this tragedy, I'll do so. I know both leaders, but I don't just jump in

56:07.440 --> 56:13.520
and assume. If there will be a desire at a certain point, because the conditions have

56:14.720 --> 56:22.080
created the possibility of helping stop this carnage, then I'll do it. And that's why I choose

56:22.080 --> 56:29.120
my words carefully, because I think that may be the best thing that I could do.

56:30.560 --> 56:35.680
Look, I think what you see in Ukraine is what happens if you have

56:37.360 --> 56:41.520
territorial designs on a territory by a country that has nuclear weapons.

56:42.880 --> 56:50.880
And that, to me, you see the change in the equation. Now, I think that people are loathe

56:50.880 --> 56:56.320
to use nuclear weapons, and I'm not sure that I would think that the Russian side would use them

56:58.080 --> 57:02.400
with happy abandon. I don't think that's the question. But you see how the whole

57:03.040 --> 57:10.480
configuration changes when that happens. So you have to be very careful on how you resolve this

57:10.480 --> 57:20.000
conflict so it doesn't go off the rails, so to speak. By the way, the corollary is here.

57:20.000 --> 57:26.880
We don't want Iran, which is an aggressive force with an aggressive ideology of dominating

57:27.520 --> 57:32.160
first the Muslim world and then eliminating Israel and then becoming a global force.

57:33.280 --> 57:37.440
Having nuclear weapons, it's totally different when they don't have it than when they do have it.

57:38.160 --> 57:45.600
And that's why one of my main goals has been to prevent Iran from having the means of mass

57:45.600 --> 57:49.920
destruction, which will be used atomic bombs, which they openly say will be used against us,

57:49.920 --> 57:53.760
and you can understand that. How to bring about an end to Ukraine?

57:55.760 --> 58:05.840
I have my ideas. I don't think it's worthwhile discussing them now because they might be required

58:05.840 --> 58:10.320
later on. Do you believe in the power of conversation since you have contacts with

58:10.320 --> 58:14.320
Vladimir Zelensky and Vladimir Putin, just leaders sitting in a room

58:15.360 --> 58:17.840
and discussing how the end of war can be brought about?

58:19.040 --> 58:22.640
I think it's a combination of that, but I think it's the question of

58:22.640 --> 58:29.760
interests and whether you have to get both sides to a point where they

58:31.520 --> 58:36.320
think that that conversation would lead to something useful. I don't think they're there

58:36.320 --> 58:43.680
right now. What part of this is just basic human ego, stubbornness, all of this between leaders,

58:44.320 --> 58:47.920
which is why I bring up the power of conversation, of sitting in a room,

58:47.920 --> 58:52.400
realizing we're human beings and then there's a history that connects Ukraine and Russia.

58:52.400 --> 58:56.000
Yeah, I don't think they're in a position to enter a room right now, realistically. I mean,

58:56.880 --> 59:02.160
you can posit that it would be good if that could happen, but entering the room is sometimes more

59:02.160 --> 59:06.880
complicated than what happens in the room, and there's a lot of pre-negotiation on the

59:06.880 --> 59:10.800
negotiation. Then you negotiate endlessly on the negotiation. They're not even there.

59:10.800 --> 59:14.400
It took a lot of work for you to get to a handshake in the past.

59:15.280 --> 59:19.280
It's an interesting question. How did the piece, the Abraham Accords, how did that begin?

59:21.280 --> 59:29.040
We had decades, 70 years or 65 years, where these people would not

59:29.760 --> 59:37.440
meet openly or even secretly with an Israeli leader. Yeah, we had the Mossad making contacts

59:37.440 --> 59:42.880
with them all the time and so on, but how do we break the ice to the top level of leadership?

59:43.520 --> 59:48.560
Well, we broke the ice because I took a very strong stance against Iran,

59:49.440 --> 59:55.840
and the Gulf states understood that Iran is a formidable danger to them, so we had a common

59:55.840 --> 01:00:01.440
interest. The second thing is that because of the economic reforms that we had produced in Israel,

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:08.160
Israel became a technological powerhouse, and that could help their nations, not only in terms

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:17.440
of anything, just bettering the life of their peoples. The combination of the desire to have

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.760
some kind of protection against Iran or some kind of cooperation against Iran and

01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:30.640
civilian economic cooperation came to a head when I gave a speech in the American Congress,

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:37.040
which I didn't do lightheartedly. I had to decide to challenge a sitting American president

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.720
and on the so-called Iranian deal, which I thought would pave Iran's path with gold

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.840
to be an effective nuclear power. That's what would happen.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:56.480
So, I went there, and in the course of giving that speech before the joint session of Congress,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:03.760
our delegation received calls from Gulf states who said,

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:07.760
we can't believe what your prime minister is doing. He's challenging, you know,

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.760
the president of the United States. Well, I had no choice, I mean, because I thought my country's

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.600
own existence was imperiled. And remember, we always understand through changing administrations

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.400
that America, no matter what leadership, is always the irreplaceable and indispensable ally

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.840
of Israel, and we'll always remain that. We can have arguments as we have, but in the family,

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.960
as we say in the mishpoche, you know, it's the family. But nevertheless, I was forced to take

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:46.000
a stand. That produced calls from Gulf states that ultimately led to clandestine meetings,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000
that ultimately flowered into the Abraham Accords. And I think we're at a point where

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:59.040
the idea of ending the Arab-Israeli conflict, not the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.760
the Arab-Israeli conflict can happen. I'm not sure it will. It depends on quite a few things,

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.400
but it could happen. And if it happens, it might open up the ending of

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:18.800
the Israeli-Islamic conflict. Remember, the Arab world is a small part. It's an important part,

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:28.560
but there are large Islamic populations. And it could bring about an end to an historic enmity

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.600
between Islam and Judaism. It could be a great thing. So, I'm looking at this larger thing.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:46.320
You can be hobbled by saying, well, you've had this hiccup in Gaza or this or that thing happening

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.320
in the Palestinians. It's important for us because we want security. But I think the larger

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:58.160
question is, can we break out into a much wider peace and ultimately come back and make

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:05.600
the peace between Israel and the Palestinians, rather than waiting to solve that and never

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:13.040
getting to paint on the larger canvas? I want to paint on the larger canvas and come back

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.880
to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.680
As you write about in your book, what have you learned about life from your father?

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:32.400
My father was a great historian, and well, he taught me several things. He said that the

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:42.160
first condition for a living organism is to identify danger in time. Because if you don't,

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.160
you could be devoured, you could be destroyed very quickly. And that's the nature of

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:53.680
human conflict. In fact, for the Jewish people, we didn't. We lost the capacity to identify

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:01.200
danger in time, and we were almost devoured and destroyed by the Nazi threat. So, when I see

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:11.360
somebody parroting the Nazi goal of destroying the Jewish state, I try to mobilize the country

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:15.520
and the world in time because I think Iran is a global threat, not only a threat to Israel.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.120
That's the first thing. The second thing is I once asked him before I got elected, I said,

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:26.400
well, what do you think is the most important quality for a prime minister of Israel?

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:31.760
And he came back with the question, what do you think? And I said, well, you have to have a vision

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:37.280
and you have to have the flexibility of navigating and working towards that vision,

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.720
be flexible, but understand where you're heading. And he said, well, you need that for anything.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:47.600
You need it for, you know, if you're a university president or if you're a leader of a corporation

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:53.920
or anything, anybody would have to have that. I said, all right, so what do you need

01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:01.600
for it to be the leader of Israel? He said, he came back to me with a word that

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:11.120
stunned me. He said, education. You need a broad and deep education or you'll be at the mercy of

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:23.440
your clerks or the press or whatever. You have to be able to do that. As I spend time in government

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:37.520
being reelected by the people of Israel, I recognize more and more how right it was.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:45.040
You need to constantly ask yourself, where's the direction we want to take the country? How do we

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.400
achieve that goal? But also understand that new disciplines are being added. You have to learn all

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:57.760
the time. You have to learn all the time. You have to add to your intellectual capital all the time.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.200
Kissinger said that, he wrote that once you enter public life, you begin to draw on your

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.560
intellectual capital and it'll be depleted very quickly if you stay a long time.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:16.240
I disagree with that. I think you have to constantly, constantly increase your understanding of

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.880
things as they change because my father was right. You need to broaden and deepen your education

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.080
as you go along. You can't just sit back and say, well, I studied some things in

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:31.120
university or in college or in Boston or at MIT and that's enough. I've done it.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.800
No. Learn, learn, learn, learn, learn. Never stop.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:40.000
And if I may suggest, as part of the education, I would add in a little literature, maybe Dostoevsky

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.160
in the plentiful of time you have as a prime minister to read.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.360
Well, I read him, but I'll tell you what I think is bigger than Dostoevsky.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.360
Oh, no. Who's that?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:55.840
Not who's that, but what's that? Dan Rather came to see me with his grandson

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.200
a few years ago and he asked me, the grandson asked me, he was a student in

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:10.000
an Ivy League college and he said he's 18 years old and he wants to study to enter politics.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:18.160
And he said, what's the most important thing that I have to study to enter a political life?

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.440
And I said, you have three things you have to study.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:32.480
Okay. History, history, and history. That's the fundamental discipline for political life,

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:38.160
but then you have to study other things. Study economics, study politics and so on,

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:46.000
and study the military. I had an advantage because I spent some years there, so I learned a lot of

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:53.520
that, but I had to acquire the other disciplines and you never acquire enough. So read, read,

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:58.000
read. And by the way, if I have to choose, I read history, history, and history.

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.880
Good works of history, not lousy books.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:08.960
Last question. You've talked about a survival of a nation. You yourself are a mortal being.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:13.680
Do you contemplate your mortality? Do you contemplate your death? Are you afraid of death?

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.800
Yes.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.280
Aren't you?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:16.560
Yes.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:24.480
Who is not? I mean, if you're a being with conscience, I mean, one of the unhappy things

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:34.240
about the human brain is that it can contemplate its own demise. And so we all make our compromises

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:41.120
with this, but I think the question is what lives on? What lives on beyond this? And I think that

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:50.000
you have to define how much of posterity do you want to influence. I cannot influence the course

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:58.800
of humanity. We are specks, you know, little specks. So that's not the issue. But in my case,

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:05.920
I've devoted my life to a very defined purpose, and that is to assure the future and security and

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:12.320
I would say permanence, but that is obviously a limited thing of the Jewish state and the Jewish

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.200
people. And I don't think one can exist without the other. So I've devoted my life to that,

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:25.840
and I hope that in my time on this earth and in my years in office, I'd have contributed to that.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:39.840
You had one heck of a life, starting from MIT to six terms as Prime Minister. Thank you for this

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.160
stroll through human history and for this conversation. It was an honor.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:49.520
Thank you, and I hope you come back to Israel many times. Remember, it's the innovation nation.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:54.800
It's a robust democracy. Don't believe all the stuff that you're being told. It'll remain that.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:02.720
It can't be any other way. And I'll tell you the other thing. It's the best ally of the United

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:10.000
States, and its importance is growing by the day because our capacities in the information world

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.480
are growing by the day. We need a coalition of the like-minded smarts. This is a smart nation,

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.720
and we share the basic values of freedom and liberty with the United States. So

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:31.840
the coalition of the smarts means Israel is the sixth eye, and America has no better ally.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.560
All right. Now, off mic, I'm going to force you to finally tell me who is going to win,

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:41.680
Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, but that's a good time to end. We ran out of time here.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.480
I'll tell you outside.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.480
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. To support this podcast,

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.400
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:58.240
some words from Mahatma Gandhi. An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.240
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
