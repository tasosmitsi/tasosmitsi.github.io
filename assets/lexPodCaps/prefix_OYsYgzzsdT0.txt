00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
This is not a nice Islamic fatherly regime.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.440
Clear signs of fascism, clear signs of the state control

00:13.920 --> 00:16.680
and pay any price to stay in power.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.080
So even violence.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.400
Extreme violence.

00:22.880 --> 00:26.000
The following is a conversation with Abbas Aminah,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.080
a historian at Yale University

00:28.120 --> 00:31.840
specializing in the modern history of Iran.

00:32.740 --> 00:37.040
My love and my heart goes out to the Iranian people

00:37.040 --> 00:39.600
in their current struggle for freedom.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.700
I hope that this conversation helps folks who listen

00:43.700 --> 00:48.700
understand the nature and the importance of this struggle.

00:48.920 --> 00:50.900
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:52.840 --> 00:54.120
in the description.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.920
And now, dear friends, here's Abbas Aminah.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.960
Let's start with the current situation in Iran.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.400
On September 16th, protests broke out in Tehran

01:05.400 --> 01:07.880
and quickly spread over the death

01:07.880 --> 01:11.860
of a 22-year-old Mahsa Aminah.

01:11.860 --> 01:15.560
Eyewitnesses saw her beaten to death by the morality police.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.800
This is a heavy topic, but it's a really important topic.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.540
Can you explain what happened?

01:21.540 --> 01:25.080
The protests are now in their sixth week.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.040
The death of that young woman, a Kurd,

01:30.040 --> 01:33.040
who was visiting Tehran as a tourist,

01:33.040 --> 01:36.600
sparked something very deep

01:37.800 --> 01:41.560
that particularly concerned the younger generations.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.440
That is what you would call the equivalent

01:44.440 --> 01:48.560
of the Z generation in this country.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.560
They call themselves Daheyi Hashtadi in Persian,

01:52.560 --> 01:57.520
because Iran follows the solar calendar of its own.

01:57.520 --> 01:59.640
It's an ancient solar calendar.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.360
And the time that they were born,

02:02.360 --> 02:04.840
they were in the 1380s.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.280
That's what they call themselves, Hashtadi.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.120
80s, Hashtad for the 80s.

02:10.120 --> 02:14.520
And well, the circumstances that surrounds

02:14.520 --> 02:19.120
the unfortunate death of this young,

02:19.160 --> 02:24.160
beautiful Kurdish woman is really tragic.

02:24.880 --> 02:29.880
She was arrested by what is referred to as the morality police,

02:29.920 --> 02:34.560
morality patrol called the Gashdeh Ershad,

02:34.560 --> 02:38.640
a guidance police, that is.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.200
Presumably there were two women,

02:41.200 --> 02:45.800
fully clad, that is officers serving on that force,

02:45.800 --> 02:47.240
and two men.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.840
And nobody exactly knows what had happened.

02:50.840 --> 02:53.800
She had been beaten up,

02:53.800 --> 02:58.520
and apparently there was no sign

02:58.520 --> 03:01.440
of any wrongdoing on her side.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.640
She was fully covered.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
It seems that there was some altercation in the process.

03:11.400 --> 03:16.160
And the outcome was that she was unconscious,

03:17.040 --> 03:20.880
not necessarily when she was arrested,

03:20.880 --> 03:22.880
but in the course of the detention,

03:22.880 --> 03:24.960
when they take them to a center,

03:24.960 --> 03:28.120
presumably to re-educate them.

03:28.120 --> 03:32.200
And she apparently collapsed,

03:32.200 --> 03:35.080
and maybe my sense is that she must have had

03:35.080 --> 03:39.800
some kind of a problem because of the skull being broken

03:39.800 --> 03:41.320
or something had happened.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.000
And she died in the hospital the next day.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.600
And that, through the social media,

03:48.600 --> 03:52.520
was widely spread throughout Iran.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.320
And almost the next day,

03:54.320 --> 03:58.560
surprisingly you could see this outburst

03:58.560 --> 04:01.600
of sympathy for her.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.120
People are in the streets weeping

04:05.000 --> 04:08.280
because she was seen as such an innocent young woman,

04:08.280 --> 04:09.600
22 years old.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.160
And the family, the mother and the father,

04:13.160 --> 04:14.760
also mourning for her.

04:15.560 --> 04:19.280
And being a court visiting Tehran,

04:20.320 --> 04:23.760
this all added up to really turn her

04:23.760 --> 04:27.360
into some kind of a martyr of this cause.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.640
And that's what it is.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.520
And her picture,

04:34.080 --> 04:37.120
graphics that were artistically produced

04:37.120 --> 04:40.920
based on her portrait has now dominates basically

04:40.920 --> 04:44.440
as the symbol of this protest movement.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.640
And the protest movement goes on.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.040
Everybody was thinking,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.480
or at least the authorities were thinking,

04:50.480 --> 04:54.240
that is going to die out in a matter of a few days.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.560
But it became more intense,

04:57.560 --> 05:01.480
first in the streets of Tehran by young women,

05:01.480 --> 05:05.760
mostly probably between, I would say, 17, 18 teenagers

05:05.760 --> 05:09.000
to 22, 23 or thereabouts.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.320
And then to university campuses all around the country.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.920
And then even to high schools.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.760
And that also made it a very remarkable protest movement

05:19.760 --> 05:22.760
because first of all, it involves the youth

05:23.640 --> 05:26.800
and not necessarily the older generations.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.040
You see them around, but not as many.

05:29.960 --> 05:33.240
Also, you see men and women together,

05:33.240 --> 05:37.480
young girls and boys.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.160
And they are adamant.

05:42.160 --> 05:47.160
They are desperate in the sense of the tone of their protest.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.280
And they are extremely courageous

05:50.280 --> 05:54.120
because they stand against the security forces

05:54.120 --> 05:59.120
that were immediately sent off to the streets.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.040
And in full gear, that is.

06:02.040 --> 06:05.200
So what are the currents of pain, emotion?

06:05.880 --> 06:10.280
What is this turmoil that rose to the surface

06:10.280 --> 06:12.640
that resulted in these big protests?

06:12.640 --> 06:16.640
What are the different feelings, ideas

06:16.640 --> 06:18.280
that came to the surface here

06:18.280 --> 06:21.760
that resulted in such quick scaling of this protest?

06:21.760 --> 06:26.760
Well, if you listen to the main slogan,

06:27.120 --> 06:29.720
which is the message of this movement,

06:29.720 --> 06:34.240
it's called women, life, freedom.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.800
Zan, zendeghi, azadi,

06:37.800 --> 06:42.800
which is a translation of actually the Kurdish equivalent,

06:43.280 --> 06:47.320
which is close to Persian being in the European language.

06:47.320 --> 06:51.800
And it's apparently initiated first

06:51.800 --> 06:54.960
in the Syrian Kurdistan,

06:54.960 --> 06:59.960
where they were fighting against the Islamic Daesh forces

07:00.240 --> 07:05.240
because they were attacking the Yazidis there

07:08.440 --> 07:11.160
and the women being enslaved.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.920
But the message as it moved,

07:12.920 --> 07:16.280
or historians are interested in this kind of trends.

07:16.280 --> 07:19.040
So it has moved to Kurdistan and from Kurdistan,

07:19.040 --> 07:21.520
now being the message of this movement,

07:21.520 --> 07:25.600
reflects pretty much sums up

07:25.600 --> 07:27.800
what this movement is all about.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.560
Women in the forefront,

07:30.560 --> 07:34.160
because of all the, one might say discriminations,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.640
the treatment, the humiliation

07:36.640 --> 07:38.480
that this younger generation feels,

07:38.480 --> 07:40.360
well, not only the younger generations,

07:40.360 --> 07:43.720
but most of the Iranian secular middle classes

07:43.720 --> 07:48.720
since 1979, basically, for the past 43 years.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.480
And they would think that these all basically symbolize

07:58.200 --> 08:03.200
or represented by the wearing,

08:04.320 --> 08:08.080
the mandatory wearing of the hijab,

08:08.080 --> 08:11.560
which is at the core of this protest.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.960
You see the young women,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.640
if you look at many of these clips

08:14.640 --> 08:17.200
that comes through in the past six weeks,

08:17.200 --> 08:21.840
women in streets take off their mandatory scarves,

08:21.840 --> 08:23.600
which is a young shawl,

08:23.600 --> 08:26.920
or some kind of a head covering, that's all.

08:26.920 --> 08:31.600
And they throw it into the bonfire

08:31.600 --> 08:33.480
in the middle of the street

08:33.480 --> 08:37.560
and they dance around it and slogans.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.680
So there is a sense of complete rejection

08:41.680 --> 08:46.680
of what this regime for 43 years have been imposing on women.

08:47.920 --> 08:51.080
It's not, as it's sometimes been portrayed,

08:51.080 --> 08:56.080
a movement against hijab through and through,

08:56.400 --> 09:01.080
but it basically says there has to be a choice

09:01.080 --> 09:03.040
for those who want to wear hijab

09:03.040 --> 09:05.880
and those who want to remain without hijab.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.520
Yeah, the hijab is a symbol of something much deeper.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.080
Much deeper.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.000
And actually, before we get into that,

09:12.000 --> 09:13.640
it's interesting to note

09:13.640 --> 09:15.520
that in many of these demonstrations

09:15.520 --> 09:19.240
we see in the university campuses or in the streets,

09:19.240 --> 09:24.040
you see women with hijab, young women with hijab,

09:24.720 --> 09:27.840
next to those who have to remove their hijab

09:27.840 --> 09:30.600
and they're together basically protesting.

09:30.600 --> 09:35.280
That's the most interesting feature of these demonstrations.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.360
And then men and women together

09:37.360 --> 09:40.080
against the segregation that the regime

09:40.080 --> 09:43.000
has imposed upon them in all these years.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.120
Now, in terms of what it represents,

09:47.120 --> 09:50.880
as I pointed out, one is the question of the whole series

09:50.880 --> 09:53.080
of one might say civil and legal

09:54.040 --> 09:56.600
discriminations against women.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.560
You are considered as a kind of a second-class citizen.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.800
You depend on your men.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.280
There's a kind of a patriarchy

10:06.280 --> 10:09.720
that has been institutionalized in the Islamic Republic

10:09.720 --> 10:12.320
in a very profound fashion.

10:12.320 --> 10:17.320
And that means that probably in matters of divorce,

10:18.160 --> 10:20.040
marriage and divorce,

10:20.040 --> 10:22.440
in matters of custody of your children,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.120
in matter of inheritance,

10:24.120 --> 10:27.600
in matter of freedom of movement,

10:27.600 --> 10:32.600
you depend on your husband, your father, your brother,

10:32.600 --> 10:35.560
a male member of your family,

10:35.560 --> 10:40.560
your child even, your son could be the case.

10:40.560 --> 10:44.400
And because of that, obviously a younger generation

10:45.400 --> 10:49.400
who is so well-informed through social media

10:49.400 --> 10:53.000
knows about the world as much as an American does,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.600
American kid does, probably sometimes more.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.000
They're very, very curious.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.320
It's from what I hear or sometimes that I've met

11:01.320 --> 11:03.240
a few of them outside Iran.

11:03.240 --> 11:06.640
You'll see that how this new generation

11:06.640 --> 11:10.480
is completely different from what the Islamic Republic

11:10.480 --> 11:13.480
wanted to create in its social engineering.

11:14.480 --> 11:18.440
It's basically the failure of 43 years

11:18.440 --> 11:22.040
of the Islamic Republic's act of imposition

11:22.040 --> 11:27.040
of a certain so-called Islamic values on women.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.600
Then it's a matter of education.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.440
You would see that there is segregation in the schools.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.320
One of the issues that now, right now

11:36.320 --> 11:38.520
is at the heart of these demonstrations

11:38.520 --> 11:42.760
is that self-services in many of the campuses

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
of Iranian universities are segregated,

11:46.000 --> 11:50.120
male and female to different rooms, to different halls.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.440
Now they're breaking through the walls

11:53.440 --> 11:56.400
virtually everywhere and sit together

11:56.400 --> 12:01.400
in order to basically resist the authorities

12:02.840 --> 12:06.320
who wants to impose segregation.

12:06.320 --> 12:10.280
In matters of appearance in the public,

12:10.320 --> 12:15.320
of course it may seem to us as kind of trivial and secondary,

12:16.280 --> 12:18.280
but appearance is important.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.640
Clothing is important.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.160
How you would imagine yourself is important.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.920
They don't want to be seen in the way

12:24.920 --> 12:27.600
that the authorities would like to impose upon them

12:27.600 --> 12:31.080
as this kind of an idea of a chaste Islamic woman

12:31.080 --> 12:35.920
who is fully covered and is fully protected.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.560
The idea of a male member of the family

12:38.560 --> 12:41.720
protects the female.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.680
That is what you would see at the heart of this rebellion.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.720
And of course that goes with everything else.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.240
The second part of this message, the idea of life

12:55.320 --> 13:00.320
basically means if you like to use the American equivalent

13:00.400 --> 13:02.280
of this is the pursuit of the happiness.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.400
That's what they want.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.520
They want fun.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.080
They want music.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.360
They want dancing.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.960
They want to be free in the street.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.880
They want to have girlfriends and live freely

13:13.880 --> 13:17.680
and don't be constantly looked by the big brother

13:17.680 --> 13:22.680
to tell them what to do and not to do or not to do.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.440
So that they share virtually with the entire Iranian society

13:30.920 --> 13:32.240
as a whole.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.320
Although the older generations, that's a big puzzle.

13:35.320 --> 13:37.600
But you would see that the older generation don't,

13:37.600 --> 13:42.360
so far at least, don't take part as extensively

13:42.360 --> 13:44.080
as one might imagine.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.200
And this is a variety of reasons.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.120
Perhaps we can get to that later on if you like.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.400
But as far as this younger generation, they don't care.

13:53.400 --> 13:57.440
They don't listen even as much to their parents

13:57.440 --> 13:59.560
as the older generations did.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.840
So one might say even the nature of the relationship

14:02.840 --> 14:07.840
between the parents and the youth has changed.

14:08.120 --> 14:12.480
It's not the concept of, again, a patriarchy

14:12.480 --> 14:15.680
that a father or even a mother

14:15.680 --> 14:19.960
would tell the daughter or son what to do.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.800
That's basically they have to negotiate.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.520
It's fundamentally a rejection of the power of authority.

14:26.520 --> 14:31.520
Parents, government, it's that every person

14:31.680 --> 14:33.760
can decide their own fate.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.440
And there's no lessening of value of the wisdom

14:37.440 --> 14:39.960
of old age and old institutions.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.880
Precisely, that's what it is.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.800
And they are surprisingly aware

14:46.800 --> 14:49.040
that where they are as a generation,

14:49.040 --> 14:52.720
so it's a sense of pride as we are different

14:52.720 --> 14:54.560
from the older generation.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.080
From your parents who compromised

14:57.080 --> 14:59.280
and lived with the restrictions

14:59.280 --> 15:01.680
that the Islamic regime put on you.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.080
Your grandfather, the grandparents

15:04.080 --> 15:06.120
was the generation that actually involved

15:06.120 --> 15:08.480
in the revolution of 79.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.720
The parents, which were the middle generation.

15:11.720 --> 15:13.400
And these are the third generation

15:13.400 --> 15:16.000
of the revolution of 1979.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.360
And therefore they differentiate themselves

15:19.360 --> 15:22.760
in terms of their identity from the older generation.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.960
So that's the life part of it.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.040
I think one can go more and more.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.280
They want to access.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.240
And they see on social media

15:30.240 --> 15:31.880
what happens in the rest of the world.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.360
They're well aware.

15:33.360 --> 15:37.360
They're much better digitally skilled

15:37.360 --> 15:40.040
than my generation, for instance.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.600
And they know about all the personalities.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
They know about all the celebrities.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.800
They know about all the trends that goes outside Iran.

15:49.800 --> 15:54.400
So that's a second part of this message.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.400
And then of course the third part is the word Azadi,

15:57.400 --> 15:59.640
meaning freedom or liberty,

15:59.640 --> 16:04.640
which is this long standing demand of the Iranians,

16:06.040 --> 16:08.600
I would say for the whole century,

16:08.600 --> 16:12.840
ever since the constitutional revolution of 1906.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.840
Iran has witnessed this problem of authorities

16:18.400 --> 16:21.160
that usually emerged at the end of a revolution

16:22.320 --> 16:25.680
to basically impose its own image

16:25.680 --> 16:28.880
on the population, on the youth,

16:28.880 --> 16:32.360
and create authoritarian regimes

16:32.360 --> 16:35.120
of which over the course of time,

16:35.120 --> 16:38.080
I would say that the Islamic Republic is the worst

16:38.080 --> 16:42.200
in the sense that its intrusion

16:42.200 --> 16:45.720
is not only in the political sense,

16:45.720 --> 16:48.960
in the, for instance, banning the freedom of speech,

16:49.960 --> 16:54.760
meddling with the elections, banning political parties,

16:54.760 --> 16:55.920
all kinds of that things,

16:55.920 --> 16:58.640
which are the political or civil freedoms,

16:58.640 --> 17:02.320
but its intrusion into the personal life of the individual,

17:02.320 --> 17:04.600
which is the worst kind in a sense,

17:04.600 --> 17:07.880
as you would see that there is always an authority

17:07.880 --> 17:12.880
that basically dominates your life or monitors your life.

17:13.120 --> 17:18.120
So, and they do it in a kind of a very consistent fashion,

17:19.760 --> 17:24.360
which makes this idea of freedom so important

17:24.360 --> 17:27.040
as part of the message of this new movement.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.560
You would see that in today's Iran,

17:31.560 --> 17:34.320
there are no independent political parties.

17:34.320 --> 17:39.320
There is very little probably freedom of the press.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.320
I wouldn't say that it's entirely gone,

17:43.320 --> 17:46.840
but it's fairly limited.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.360
There's enormous amount of propaganda machine

17:50.360 --> 17:55.360
which dominates the entire radio and TV system in Iran.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.600
It's completely in the hands of the government.

18:00.600 --> 18:05.520
And of course you would see this variety of other tools

18:05.520 --> 18:09.520
for trying to indoctrinate Iranian population

18:12.080 --> 18:13.400
across the board.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.560
So that's another sign of this kind of a sense of,

18:17.400 --> 18:22.400
a sense of being totally left out.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.160
You're not belonging to what's going on

18:27.160 --> 18:31.640
in terms of empowerment and disempowerment.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.200
So that's the situation as far as the idea

18:35.200 --> 18:37.160
of a freedomist concept.

18:37.160 --> 18:40.680
And these three somewhat miraculously,

18:40.680 --> 18:44.160
and perhaps unintentionally,

18:44.320 --> 18:49.320
the three parts of this message complements each other

18:50.080 --> 18:54.000
because perhaps for the first time we see that women

18:54.000 --> 18:57.840
are in the forefront of a movement.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.360
I hesitate to say revolution

18:59.360 --> 19:02.840
because I'm not particularly happy with revolutions.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.480
Revolutions worldwide in Iran have always been so miserable

19:07.480 --> 19:10.160
in terms of their outcome that we have to be careful

19:10.160 --> 19:12.960
not to use the word revolution again.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.560
So that's where it stands now.

19:15.560 --> 19:19.680
And the regime was thinking that, well, these are kids.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.040
They're going to go away.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.560
And then of course they're completely conspiratorial

19:25.560 --> 19:26.760
in their thinking.

19:28.160 --> 19:33.160
They constantly think that these are all the instigations

19:33.840 --> 19:36.680
and provocations of foreign powers.

19:36.680 --> 19:40.200
These are the great Satan in the United States.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.800
This is Israel.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.560
Or these are actually the supreme leaders

19:44.560 --> 19:48.440
that in so many words, his only response so far

19:48.440 --> 19:51.240
that he had in the past six weeks

19:51.240 --> 19:53.720
with regard to these demonstrations is that

19:53.720 --> 19:56.160
these are the children of the SAVAK,

19:56.160 --> 19:59.520
SAVAK being the security forces of the Shah Stein.

19:59.520 --> 20:04.520
That's 43 years later, he claims that the children,

20:06.240 --> 20:11.120
16, 17 years, 20 years old, kids in the street

20:11.120 --> 20:16.120
are the grandchildren or children of some imaginary survival

20:17.840 --> 20:19.640
of the Shah security force.

20:19.640 --> 20:24.640
So the idea is that these protests are internal

20:25.680 --> 20:29.760
and external saboteurs,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.920
so people trying to sabotage the government.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.280
Yes, and they are misled as far as they can go.

20:36.280 --> 20:39.280
And then there's the great Satan in the United States

20:39.280 --> 20:43.760
and other places are controlling,

20:43.760 --> 20:46.800
sort of either controlling the narrative,

20:46.800 --> 20:51.800
feeding propaganda, or literally sending people

20:51.800 --> 20:53.240
to instigate.

20:53.240 --> 20:57.320
I don't think even they have that kind of imagination,

20:57.320 --> 20:59.480
precise to say what you have said,

20:59.480 --> 21:03.160
that they would say that they're controlling the narrative.

21:03.160 --> 21:06.240
They basically say, no, these are agents

21:06.600 --> 21:08.240
of the foreign powers.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.640
And their families are all sold out

21:10.640 --> 21:13.320
and they are basically lost their loyalties

21:13.320 --> 21:16.560
to the great Islamic Republic.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.120
And therefore they can be treated so brutally,

21:21.120 --> 21:22.960
they can be suppressed so brutally,

21:22.960 --> 21:25.200
which I haven't actually said what they are doing

21:25.200 --> 21:27.840
because I thought perhaps first we should talk about

21:27.840 --> 21:29.920
who these kids are in the street

21:29.920 --> 21:33.920
before we move on about the response of the government.

21:33.920 --> 21:38.920
But one major factor which seems to add to the anxiety

21:40.800 --> 21:44.880
of, well, the regime is extremely anxious now

21:44.880 --> 21:47.160
because they're in a position,

21:47.160 --> 21:49.800
this shows that they don't have the lack of confidence

21:49.800 --> 21:52.960
in a sense, that they would see them reacting

21:52.960 --> 21:56.360
in a very forceful way because basically

21:56.360 --> 21:59.360
they don't seem to have that kind of a confidence

21:59.360 --> 22:03.840
to allow this message or the movement

22:04.840 --> 22:06.160
to be aired.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.840
But the one element which corresponds to that

22:09.840 --> 22:13.760
is that there is an expatriate population

22:13.760 --> 22:16.120
of Iranians worldwide.

22:16.120 --> 22:19.120
There are probably now, according to some estimates,

22:19.120 --> 22:22.760
close to 4 million, even more, Iranians abroad.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.920
And they're all over the world from Australia

22:24.920 --> 22:29.200
and New Zealand, Japan, Western Europe,

22:29.560 --> 22:34.560
Turkey and United States and Canada.

22:35.320 --> 22:40.320
So just to give you one example, last Saturday,

22:42.040 --> 22:45.560
there was a mass demonstrations in Berlin

22:45.560 --> 22:48.920
by the Iranians from Germany and all over Europe,

22:48.920 --> 22:50.360
Western Europe.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.880
And it was at least, I think probably

22:52.880 --> 22:56.560
the conservative estimate was about 100,000.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.640
So 100,000 Iranians showed up in Berlin

23:00.640 --> 23:03.520
demonstrating against the treatment

23:03.520 --> 23:08.520
of the women in Iran or the movement in Iran.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.720
The government thinks, obviously,

23:11.720 --> 23:16.720
this must have been some instigation by foreign powers

23:17.000 --> 23:20.360
and they want to destroy the Islamic Republic.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.400
And not only that, but the propaganda is kind of ridiculous

23:24.400 --> 23:28.320
because I listened actually to how they portrayed it

23:28.320 --> 23:29.400
in the newspapers.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.200
I listened to the Iranian news

23:32.200 --> 23:35.760
that is officially controlled, government-controlled news.

23:35.760 --> 23:39.280
And in the papers, there's much of the papers

23:39.280 --> 23:41.800
that are in the control of the government.

23:41.800 --> 23:46.800
One of them or actually the major news program

23:47.320 --> 23:52.280
portrayed the demonstrations that 10,000 people

23:52.280 --> 23:57.280
showed up in Berlin and protested against the rising prices

23:58.760 --> 24:03.760
or rising rates for gas and oil in Germany.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.920
So that's how they mislead in a very rather stupid fashion

24:07.920 --> 24:12.920
because probably 95%, if not 100% of the Iranians

24:13.640 --> 24:18.640
are listening to Persian-speaking media outside Iran.

24:19.600 --> 24:24.600
So it's a BBC Persian, there is Iran International,

24:24.960 --> 24:27.160
there are at least five or six of them.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.280
That's probably really important to highlight

24:29.280 --> 24:34.280
that Iran is a very modern and tech-savvy nation,

24:36.280 --> 24:37.600
not just the young people.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.080
Probably more than I feel sometimes

24:41.080 --> 24:44.240
when I compare myself to what they are doing.

24:44.240 --> 24:49.240
Since 1979, the earlier years, for a decade or two,

24:50.240 --> 24:52.440
they tried in a very crude fashion

24:52.440 --> 24:57.440
to restrict access to media outside Iran

24:59.040 --> 25:01.920
because it's all through dishes, okay?

25:01.920 --> 25:04.200
And satellite dishes are everywhere.

25:04.200 --> 25:09.200
If you look at the buildings of small towns

25:10.200 --> 25:15.080
and villages in Iran, there's always a dish.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.640
And they watch all kinds of things through this.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.400
And particularly because of what's happening now,

25:22.400 --> 25:26.200
they listen to all the news broadcasts

25:28.040 --> 25:30.920
from all this media and they're extremely active.

25:31.800 --> 25:36.800
There are probably some of them even 24 hours or close,

25:37.600 --> 25:42.400
very extensive coverage of every clip that comes through.

25:42.400 --> 25:46.640
So what the government is doing now, the Islamic Republic,

25:46.640 --> 25:50.920
is that they restrict the entire internet.

25:50.920 --> 25:51.840
They shut down the internet.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.520
They shut down the internet,

25:53.520 --> 25:56.440
but they cannot afford shutting down the internet

25:56.440 --> 25:59.760
because much of the business, much of the everyday life,

25:59.760 --> 26:04.480
much of the government affairs depends on the internet,

26:04.480 --> 26:06.040
like everywhere else.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.440
And Iran is extremely,

26:08.440 --> 26:13.440
if I hear from many of the colleagues and friends,

26:15.200 --> 26:18.440
it's like in certain respects, it's like Sweden.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.240
Where you go there, there's no more currency.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.440
And for a very good reason

26:22.440 --> 26:24.360
because there's so much inflation

26:24.360 --> 26:28.200
that the banknotes are worthless in a sense.

26:28.200 --> 26:32.640
So everything is through sweeping your card.

26:33.480 --> 26:37.200
And that, the entire system is in a standstill

26:37.200 --> 26:40.200
because people cannot buy food.

26:40.200 --> 26:43.520
You go to the supermarket, that's how you would do it.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.440
You order food to come to your house,

26:47.440 --> 26:50.040
which Iranians, at least the middle classes,

26:50.040 --> 26:53.560
the more prosperous middle classes doing all the time.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.680
So they deliver everything.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.600
And because of the COVID, it became even more.

26:58.600 --> 27:02.920
And they have to pay all through this system.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.440
So what happens is that now they're estimating

27:05.440 --> 27:09.240
that every day, $50 million, the Iranian government

27:09.240 --> 27:11.480
or the Iranian economy is losing

27:11.480 --> 27:13.280
because of slowing the internet.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.840
Plus the frustration is growing

27:15.840 --> 27:17.880
because you can't order food.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.840
Among other things.

27:20.840 --> 27:25.840
I mean, they are in touch with, I mean, WhatsApp,

27:26.760 --> 27:30.760
every Iranian, virtually every Iranian

27:31.800 --> 27:35.360
that has education and education in the sense

27:35.360 --> 27:40.360
that has gone through the high schools and universities

27:40.600 --> 27:42.240
knows how to use the WhatsApp.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.080
So there's a big middle class,

27:44.080 --> 27:46.520
like you said, secular middle class in Iran.

27:46.520 --> 27:50.960
And there, there's a lot of at least capacity for,

27:51.000 --> 27:56.000
if not revolution, then political, ideological turmoil.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.280
And a huge amount of hatred.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.400
So the hatred has grown.

28:03.400 --> 28:08.400
Yes, hatred of the policies, of the regime, of isolation.

28:10.400 --> 28:15.040
That's a huge point that you hear a great deal about.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.760
That we don't want to be isolated.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.320
We don't want to be humiliated.

28:18.320 --> 28:23.320
Iran is not about this miserable regime

28:23.600 --> 28:27.120
that is ruling over us.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.520
We have a great culture.

28:28.520 --> 28:32.880
So there's a sense of a pride in their own culture.

28:32.880 --> 28:37.520
Some of it, Islamic, some of it pre-Islamic.

28:37.520 --> 28:42.520
So there's a huge sense of a pride in that.

28:42.600 --> 28:46.080
And they see that they cannot communicate

28:46.080 --> 28:47.800
with the outside world.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.800
They want to travel abroad, which they do.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.040
I mean, for one thing, the Iranian regime

28:55.040 --> 28:59.160
never actually, for majority of the population,

28:59.160 --> 29:01.800
never put restrictions.

29:01.800 --> 29:06.480
It's not like Soviet Union where you have to have a,

29:06.480 --> 29:08.600
you used to have a permission

29:08.600 --> 29:10.440
to move from one place to another.

29:11.400 --> 29:16.400
And then of course, the Islamic regime since 1979,

29:16.600 --> 29:20.920
basically chased away or destroyed the old middle class.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.880
It was my generation, basically.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.160
My parents' generation.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.960
These are the secular middle class of the Pahlavi era

29:27.960 --> 29:30.560
in the hope that they can do this social engineering

29:30.560 --> 29:35.560
and create this Islamic society of their own.

29:36.640 --> 29:41.360
The bad news for them was that that didn't happen

29:41.360 --> 29:44.640
and that memory persisted.

29:44.640 --> 29:49.240
And the middle class that was created since past 40 years

29:49.240 --> 29:53.000
is much larger in size than what it was

29:53.000 --> 29:56.080
because there was, of course, the demographic revolution.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.680
That's a very foundation of it,

29:59.680 --> 30:01.840
is the demographic revolution.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.680
Population in Iran, I've written an article about it,

30:04.680 --> 30:06.080
actually.

30:06.080 --> 30:11.080
Population in Iran since the turn of the century,

30:11.320 --> 30:13.800
last century, that's 20th century.

30:13.840 --> 30:17.120
Population of Iran was about nine million or so.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.760
It's now 83 million.

30:21.560 --> 30:26.560
And that is since 1979, the population was 35 million.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.680
Between the past 40 years, it's basically doubled.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.600
So it's 83 million.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.000
Although one of the great successes,

30:37.000 --> 30:39.680
I don't want to bore you with the details

30:39.680 --> 30:42.480
about the demography, but it's important.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.960
Demographics is not boring.

30:45.960 --> 30:50.880
Well, you can see that the birth rate was very high.

30:50.880 --> 30:53.040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have doubled your population

30:53.040 --> 30:55.120
in a matter of four decades.

30:55.120 --> 31:00.280
But Iranians, because of the urban shift

31:00.280 --> 31:02.200
to an urban population,

31:02.200 --> 31:04.800
because of the growth of the middle class,

31:04.800 --> 31:06.520
because of the education,

31:07.400 --> 31:12.400
they basically, the pattern of growth,

31:13.120 --> 31:14.960
population growth changed.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.960
Iran used to be 2.8 or 3% birth rate in around 1980s.

31:24.240 --> 31:27.160
I would say 1970s, 1980s.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.960
Now, it is 1.1.

31:31.120 --> 31:34.640
And it's probably the most successful country

31:34.640 --> 31:38.360
in the Middle East in terms of the population control.

31:38.360 --> 31:43.360
Despite the government consistent attempt

31:44.360 --> 31:49.080
to try to encourage people to have more kids,

31:49.080 --> 31:51.800
middle class refuses to do that.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.720
And this is middle class not only anymore in the capital,

31:55.720 --> 31:58.640
but this is very smaller towns and cities,

31:58.640 --> 32:01.240
places that used to be villages.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.280
Now you look at them, they have a decent population,

32:04.920 --> 32:09.120
50,000, 100,000, and they live an urban life.

32:09.120 --> 32:13.600
And they don't want to be subjected to that old pattern

32:13.600 --> 32:18.040
of agrarian society when you had 10 children or eight children.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.440
And of course, it's a much more advanced

32:21.440 --> 32:26.440
in terms of health and medicine.

32:27.440 --> 32:30.120
So you don't lose children as they used to.

32:30.120 --> 32:34.880
The antibiotics, there's always kids to survive.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.440
And therefore, if you have 10 kids,

32:36.440 --> 32:38.080
you stick with 10 kids.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.200
You don't end up with four as it used to be in the past.

32:43.040 --> 32:48.040
Six of them would have died up to the age of five actually.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.320
But now because of that,

32:50.320 --> 32:54.840
you see that this urban population in the cities

32:54.840 --> 32:57.680
have completely different demands.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.880
And of course, the education is important.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.600
That's another area of how the social engineering

33:03.600 --> 33:06.440
of the Islamic Republic went away

33:06.440 --> 33:10.280
because they were thinking that the growth

33:10.280 --> 33:13.440
of the population, the growth of the educated,

33:13.440 --> 33:17.800
higher educated middle classes in their benefit,

33:17.800 --> 33:21.600
or they could not even control it in a sense.

33:21.600 --> 33:26.600
Now Iran in my time probably had in the 1970s,

33:26.800 --> 33:31.360
in the 1970s, probably by the time of the revolution

33:31.360 --> 33:34.360
had 10, 12 universities.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.120
Now it has 56 universities all across the country.

33:39.120 --> 33:41.200
And there is something referred to

33:41.200 --> 33:44.080
as the free university, Azad,

33:44.080 --> 33:46.360
which has campuses all over the country.

33:46.360 --> 33:49.960
It has 321 campuses all around Iran.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.840
What does that mean?

33:52.840 --> 33:57.280
In many respects, this youth that are brought up

33:57.280 --> 34:00.560
in these families, even in a small towns

34:00.560 --> 34:02.720
in very traditional families,

34:02.720 --> 34:07.600
in families that belong to that kind of a more religious,

34:07.600 --> 34:12.600
loyal to the clergy or to the clerical classes,

34:13.040 --> 34:18.040
their children can now move on, particularly women.

34:18.920 --> 34:22.760
Because in my times it would have been unheard of

34:23.680 --> 34:28.680
that you would have a young woman of 18 or 17, 18, 19

34:29.360 --> 34:34.360
from a traditional city such as, for instance, Yazd

34:34.560 --> 34:39.560
or in Southeastern Iran to move on elsewhere for education

34:42.720 --> 34:44.080
as you do in this country.

34:45.200 --> 34:50.200
Now it's completely accepted that a woman

34:50.960 --> 34:54.440
wears a job because he's forced to wear a job

34:54.440 --> 34:57.280
to go to a university completely

34:57.280 --> 34:59.760
on the other side of the country.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.960
And this movement of the population,

35:02.960 --> 35:06.840
not only because of the universities, but in general,

35:06.840 --> 35:11.840
if you now visit Iran, you hear accents, local accents,

35:13.800 --> 35:16.680
provincial accents all over the country.

35:17.640 --> 35:21.720
That is a Azerbaijani Turkish accent

35:21.720 --> 35:24.520
from the Northwest of the country.

35:24.520 --> 35:27.320
You can hear it in the first province in the South

35:27.320 --> 35:29.080
and vice versa.

35:29.080 --> 35:34.080
So, and Kurdish for instance, or even more marginal regions

35:34.400 --> 35:39.240
such as Sistan province in the Southeast of Iran,

35:39.240 --> 35:41.920
which has been the subject of this recent massacre

35:41.920 --> 35:44.360
when they actually attacked the population

35:44.600 --> 35:48.640
demonstrating and killed a fair number of at least 60 people.

35:50.280 --> 35:54.040
So this movement of the population,

35:55.280 --> 35:57.800
this creation of a larger middle class,

35:57.800 --> 36:01.200
the better educated middle class, much better educated.

36:01.200 --> 36:06.200
Iran has 86% literacy, which I think probably,

36:10.360 --> 36:11.200
I haven't checked that,

36:11.200 --> 36:13.640
but probably is better than Turkey even,

36:13.680 --> 36:16.960
is probably better than anywhere else in the Middle East.

36:16.960 --> 36:20.440
And it sounds like that's quickly increasing.

36:20.440 --> 36:21.960
So because of the movement,

36:21.960 --> 36:24.040
because of the growth of the education system,

36:24.040 --> 36:24.880
that's-

36:24.880 --> 36:25.800
Precisely.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.080
Iran has 1 million school teachers,

36:30.040 --> 36:33.960
which may not seem as much if you're in the United States,

36:33.960 --> 36:36.600
but it's a fairly big number, actually.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.320
Can you linger on the massacre?

36:38.320 --> 36:39.160
What happened there?

36:39.160 --> 36:44.160
Well, the Sistan province is a Baluch ethnicity

36:44.240 --> 36:45.800
of Baluch ethnicity.

36:45.800 --> 36:50.680
Baluch is a particular ethnic group in southern Iran,

36:50.680 --> 36:54.400
which is Sunni rather than Shi, majority.

36:54.400 --> 36:58.480
And we should say that most of Iran is Shi

36:58.480 --> 37:01.760
and that's a branch of Islam.

37:01.760 --> 37:03.080
Shiism, yes.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.040
Let's maybe just briefly linger Shiism and Sunni.

37:07.520 --> 37:08.360
What?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.560
Just, let's not get into it.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
Yeah, I don't want to.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.160
Let's do a one sentence summary

37:14.160 --> 37:18.720
and that maybe which is what most of Iran is.

37:18.720 --> 37:23.160
Majority of the population of the Muslim world are Sunnis.

37:24.040 --> 37:27.640
That are, these are mainstream if you like to call it.

37:27.640 --> 37:31.200
Actually, Sunna means that kind of a mainstream.

37:31.200 --> 37:36.200
Can you actually linger on the Sunni, Sunna, Shi, Shia?

37:36.880 --> 37:41.120
Shia means a party, means those that belongs

37:41.120 --> 37:43.840
to a party of Ali, which was,

37:43.840 --> 37:47.440
goes back to the early Islamic history of seventh century.

37:47.440 --> 37:49.800
I mean, I'm almost lingering to the silly notion

37:49.800 --> 37:51.480
of pronunciation and stuff like that.

37:51.480 --> 37:55.400
So ah, ah means part, like what,

37:55.400 --> 37:57.960
what does the extra ah at the end do?

37:57.960 --> 38:02.960
Shia means belonging to the Shi community.

38:03.040 --> 38:06.160
Shia means a person of a Shia.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.480
If you say, are you a Shia?

38:08.480 --> 38:09.640
Yes, I'm a Shia.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.560
Yeah, and Shi is the community.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.480
Community.

38:12.480 --> 38:16.120
And in English, when it was Anglicized, it becomes Shiite.

38:16.120 --> 38:20.720
So if you say Shiite in today, it's perfectly acceptable.

38:20.720 --> 38:23.200
And of course, I myself in my writings,

38:23.200 --> 38:26.840
I always switch between one and the other.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.960
One of my books is always Shiite,

38:28.960 --> 38:31.000
the other book's always Shi.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.880
And that hasn't been settled.

38:33.880 --> 38:37.520
But the Shi population is the smaller compared

38:37.520 --> 38:39.600
to the Sunni population in the world.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.440
In the world.

38:40.440 --> 38:41.280
In the world.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.800
But in Iran, it's the opposite.

38:42.800 --> 38:47.480
The Iran and Iraq, and possibly in our Lebanon,

38:47.480 --> 38:51.040
are the three countries who barely,

38:51.040 --> 38:56.040
Iraq and Lebanon have barely majority Shi population.

38:56.760 --> 39:01.520
Whereas Iran is a large Shi population

39:01.520 --> 39:04.760
due to its history of conversion to Shiism

39:04.760 --> 39:07.120
that by itself is another story.

39:07.120 --> 39:12.120
But in the sense that the way that historically it evolved,

39:14.520 --> 39:18.080
the center became more Shi,

39:18.080 --> 39:22.480
and the peripheries remained Sunni.

39:22.480 --> 39:26.880
So you have communities of the Baluch in the Southeast,

39:26.880 --> 39:31.000
you have the Kurds, a large portion of the Kurds

39:31.040 --> 39:34.080
are Sunnis, they have Shias as well.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.080
Then they have the indigenous religion

39:36.080 --> 39:39.240
of their own, it was called Ahle Haq,

39:39.240 --> 39:42.920
which is the religion of indigenous to Kurdistan.

39:42.920 --> 39:46.440
There are Turkomans in the northeast of Iran

39:46.440 --> 39:48.160
who are also Sunnis.

39:48.160 --> 39:50.520
There are other communities in Khorasan region

39:50.520 --> 39:53.040
in the peripheries of Afghanistan.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.680
They are also Sunnis.

39:54.680 --> 39:57.640
And you have some Arab population,

39:57.640 --> 40:00.760
Arab speaking population in the Khuzestan province

40:01.400 --> 40:02.640
in the southwest of Iran,

40:02.640 --> 40:04.960
which is also all across the Persian Gulf.

40:04.960 --> 40:07.080
Is there a lot of conflict between these regions?

40:07.080 --> 40:11.160
And also, like if I blindfolded you

40:11.160 --> 40:13.000
and dropped you off in one of the regions,

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
would you quickly recognize the region?

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Like by the food, by the music, by the accents, by so on?

40:20.280 --> 40:23.240
Yeah, the answer to your lovely question,

40:23.240 --> 40:26.120
which I think, I hope it would have happened to me,

40:26.120 --> 40:29.320
is that yes, you would see different cultures.

40:30.160 --> 40:35.160
But different food, most important, different accents.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.600
Or different languages, since they have dialects,

40:38.600 --> 40:42.560
there's Baluch is a different language altogether.

40:42.560 --> 40:46.560
But, or so for that matter, Kurdish,

40:46.560 --> 40:48.160
which is closer to Persian

40:48.160 --> 40:50.360
because they are all Indo-European languages.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.520
But Turkish, Azeri Turkish,

40:53.520 --> 40:56.880
which is probably closer to the Turkish of Turkey,

40:56.880 --> 40:58.240
Republic of Turkey,

40:58.240 --> 41:00.680
or to the Republic of Azerbaijan in the north.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.320
They are the same, basically.

41:04.320 --> 41:06.560
Actually, if you would have looked,

41:06.560 --> 41:08.720
that's a fascinating picture.

41:08.720 --> 41:12.000
If you have looked at the, let's say even 19th century,

41:12.000 --> 41:15.200
early 20th century, linguistic map of Iran,

41:15.200 --> 41:19.360
you would have been amazed in the number of dialects,

41:19.360 --> 41:22.080
in the number of languages that have survived.

41:22.080 --> 41:25.280
This is an ancient country, it's an ancient land.

41:25.280 --> 41:29.520
And it's a lot of mountains all around it, or big deserts.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.080
So there's a sense of isolation.

41:31.080 --> 41:32.800
So you would say here and there,

41:32.800 --> 41:37.000
you see a different community that speaks differently.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
All ancient traditions and languages.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.680
Yeah, and because of the great number of invasions

41:42.680 --> 41:47.680
that Iran witnessed over more than two and a half millennia.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.640
Of course, there are all kinds of cultures

41:51.640 --> 41:53.160
that were introduced into Iran.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.080
There are all, ethnicities were introduced to Iran.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.640
Mostly coming from the northeast of Iran,

42:00.640 --> 42:05.640
from the lowlands of Central Asia and beyond,

42:07.120 --> 42:10.280
and continued into Iran proper.

42:10.280 --> 42:12.600
So, but now what has happened,

42:12.600 --> 42:14.720
that's my point that I wanted to make.

42:15.880 --> 42:20.200
Century of modernity or modernization

42:20.200 --> 42:25.040
has produced a national culture

42:25.040 --> 42:28.680
of great strength in a sense, I would say.

42:28.680 --> 42:33.680
I ended my book, the book on Iran, Iran and Modern History.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.600
Basically saying that despite everything else

42:37.600 --> 42:40.680
that has created so much trouble for today's Iran,

42:40.680 --> 42:43.680
there is a sense of a cultural identity

42:46.200 --> 42:48.120
that is very strong.

42:48.120 --> 42:53.120
And I think I can say with some confidence

42:54.600 --> 42:59.600
that despite this regional identities

43:00.520 --> 43:02.280
that are still there and they're great

43:02.280 --> 43:03.840
and they should be celebrated,

43:06.360 --> 43:11.360
today if you go to Kurdistan or if you go to Sistan,

43:13.400 --> 43:15.480
they all can speak Persian.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.200
They all have an education in Persian.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.640
So they all basically are becoming part

43:21.640 --> 43:25.960
of whether they like the regime in power or not.

43:25.960 --> 43:29.360
They have a sense of belonging to a culture

43:29.360 --> 43:32.160
and an identity with the center.

43:32.160 --> 43:35.920
And of course the idea of a center versus periphery

43:35.920 --> 43:38.040
in Iran is very old.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.040
It goes back to ancient times

43:40.040 --> 43:43.080
because even the name of the country

43:43.080 --> 43:44.840
was the guarded domains of Iran.

43:45.800 --> 43:50.200
This is the official name of Maamalik Mahmoud, say Iran.

43:50.200 --> 43:53.560
Namely that it was recognized

43:53.560 --> 43:57.560
that this is not just one entity,

43:57.560 --> 44:00.680
but it's a collection of entities.

44:00.680 --> 44:02.680
Like the United States of America.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.800
Exactly, exactly.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.800
But the United States of America,

44:07.800 --> 44:11.040
in a sense you can say that it was a very successful,

44:11.040 --> 44:13.560
well, it remains to be seen how successful.

44:13.560 --> 44:14.960
To be continued.

44:14.960 --> 44:19.240
To be, that was basically invented, created

44:19.240 --> 44:22.320
that you would have this sense of it.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
In the case of an old nation,

44:24.320 --> 44:27.680
which has been on the map of the world for 3,000 years,

44:27.680 --> 44:31.400
2,500 years, this is not an exaggeration.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.760
I'm not a nationalist per se,

44:34.760 --> 44:37.240
but I mean, if you look Persian,

44:37.240 --> 44:39.440
the map of the world in ancient times

44:39.440 --> 44:41.760
is still there as it is today.

44:41.760 --> 44:44.720
Very few countries in the world are like that.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.200
That they would have that kind of a continuity

44:47.200 --> 44:48.520
over a course of time.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.040
And that's not without a reason,

44:50.040 --> 44:55.040
because there was this sense of a center versus periphery

44:56.120 --> 44:59.720
that had found some, there's a huge amount of tension,

44:59.720 --> 45:03.080
but there is also a sense of belonging to something.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.800
And state is very much at the center of it.

45:05.800 --> 45:10.800
I mean, that's why the concept of a state matters

45:11.520 --> 45:15.680
for the creation, for the shaping of this culture.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.360
What happened is, therefore, you can see that today

45:18.360 --> 45:22.320
in answer to your point about traveling blindfolded.

45:22.320 --> 45:27.320
Is that you would be surprised to see

45:27.320 --> 45:31.440
how much people share.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.680
And in terms of, I just give you one anecdote.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.640
In 1968, I believe, must have been,

45:43.480 --> 45:45.000
I traveled to Azerbaijan.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.560
I used to travel and actually photographed.

45:47.560 --> 45:48.800
Not blindfolded.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.800
No.

45:49.800 --> 45:50.640
Mostly.

45:50.640 --> 45:54.360
Well, yeah, not blindfolded, no, not blindfolded.

45:54.360 --> 45:58.040
So I went to a bazaar in the city of Khoi,

45:58.040 --> 46:03.040
which is in the northwestern Iran on the border

46:03.280 --> 46:07.080
with what is today the Republic of Turkey.

46:08.520 --> 46:11.320
And I went to the bazaar and I was interested

46:11.320 --> 46:13.800
in the kind of a letter work that they produce.

46:14.840 --> 46:16.680
So I tried to buy some stuff

46:16.680 --> 46:18.560
and they were surprised to see that

46:18.560 --> 46:20.720
how few people knew Persian.

46:21.960 --> 46:26.120
So they could not communicate in Persian with you.

46:26.120 --> 46:30.160
Either they have to ask somebody from some other store

46:30.160 --> 46:32.560
to come and translate for you.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.000
This is 1968.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.640
1968, so even though it's the official language.

46:38.640 --> 46:39.960
Was Persian.

46:39.960 --> 46:42.160
Of the country, they're still.

46:42.160 --> 46:43.000
Yeah.

46:43.000 --> 46:44.120
So what are they teaching in school?

46:44.120 --> 46:44.960
So it doesn't matter.

46:44.960 --> 46:45.880
It was Persian.

46:45.880 --> 46:46.920
But this guy.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.120
He doesn't go to school.

46:48.120 --> 46:49.560
He hasn't been to the school

46:49.560 --> 46:51.920
or he was not fully exposed to it.

46:51.920 --> 46:55.360
And bazaars usually are very conservative places.

46:55.360 --> 46:57.080
So it stuck in my mind.

46:57.080 --> 47:02.080
Now, recently in 2004, I was traveling

47:02.080 --> 47:04.560
to the same area, not to the same city,

47:04.560 --> 47:06.640
but to the same area.

47:06.640 --> 47:10.760
And I was amazed to see how the youth,

47:11.760 --> 47:12.760
as soon as they would know

47:12.760 --> 47:15.440
that you're coming from somewhere else.

47:15.440 --> 47:17.000
Opening conversation with you,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.760
talking about the latest movies

47:19.760 --> 47:21.160
that was produced in the West.

47:21.160 --> 47:22.360
And it's not only Hollywood.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.960
Of course, there's a huge amount of fascination

47:24.960 --> 47:27.320
with Hollywood and Western cinema.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.240
Cinema is a major thing.

47:29.240 --> 47:31.560
Filmmaking is a major thing.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.760
So these kids in the city of Ahar

47:34.760 --> 47:36.800
were asking me, we're having lunch.

47:36.800 --> 47:39.480
They're asking me, okay, then what do you think

47:39.480 --> 47:42.440
about this producer, not producer,

47:42.440 --> 47:45.120
this director or that actor?

47:45.120 --> 47:45.960
American.

47:45.960 --> 47:49.320
American, European as well, but mostly American.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.520
Were they speaking Persian?

47:50.520 --> 47:52.200
It was a complete Persian

47:52.200 --> 47:55.080
that I would converse with them.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.200
Do they speak English too?

47:56.200 --> 47:57.040
Interesting.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.860
Yes.

47:57.860 --> 47:58.700
Actually, you would be surprised

47:58.700 --> 48:01.780
to see what percentage of the Iranian youth,

48:01.780 --> 48:03.820
at least in big cities,

48:03.820 --> 48:06.500
are fascinated with learning language.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.900
And for a reason,

48:07.900 --> 48:10.700
because they think that's the way to get access

48:10.700 --> 48:14.260
either on social media or eventually leave Iran,

48:14.260 --> 48:15.660
unfortunately.

48:15.660 --> 48:18.220
And because they don't see a future

48:18.220 --> 48:19.740
for themselves in the country,

48:19.740 --> 48:24.740
either you have to be part of this regime,

48:25.140 --> 48:26.300
or if you hate them

48:26.300 --> 48:29.100
and you don't like the way of their life,

48:29.100 --> 48:31.740
you look up outside.

48:31.740 --> 48:35.700
I was having drivers to drive me around the country

48:35.700 --> 48:37.660
in the cities around Iran.

48:37.660 --> 48:41.620
And the guy was young, extremely well-educated,

48:41.620 --> 48:44.260
well-dressed, and we would have looked at him,

48:44.260 --> 48:46.300
we could have found him in any street

48:46.300 --> 48:48.860
in any country in the Western world.

48:48.860 --> 48:53.100
And his major concern, knowing that I'm from outside,

48:53.180 --> 48:55.300
major concern is, well, tell me

48:55.300 --> 48:58.220
which would be a better place for me to go.

48:58.220 --> 49:01.060
So what's wrong with the place that you're in right now?

49:01.060 --> 49:02.380
You are in your own country,

49:02.380 --> 49:03.460
you speak your own language,

49:03.460 --> 49:05.700
oh, this is no good.

49:05.700 --> 49:07.580
I have to have a better future.

49:07.580 --> 49:09.700
This has no future for me.

49:09.700 --> 49:11.020
Well, it's really interesting

49:11.020 --> 49:14.540
because the thing I feel about the protests right now

49:15.460 --> 49:18.700
is there's a large number of people

49:18.700 --> 49:21.860
that instead of giving into cynicism

49:22.020 --> 49:26.100
about, you know, this government is no good,

49:26.100 --> 49:30.220
they're actually getting this like energy,

49:30.220 --> 49:32.900
this desire for revolution

49:34.820 --> 49:38.020
in the sort of non-violence

49:38.020 --> 49:39.940
in the democratic sense of that.

49:39.940 --> 49:41.980
Let's actually find the ideas,

49:41.980 --> 49:44.060
let's build a great nation here.

49:44.060 --> 49:45.980
This is a great nation, this is my nation,

49:45.980 --> 49:47.340
let's build something great here.

49:47.340 --> 49:48.580
Well.

49:48.580 --> 49:50.420
That's my hope, that's the outside.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.540
Yeah, yeah.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.220
That's what I'm hoping for.

49:53.220 --> 49:56.980
I share your aspiration,

49:56.980 --> 50:00.820
but I'm fearing that I hope it's not a wishful thinking.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.980
Certainly that's what they want.

50:03.980 --> 50:06.860
Certainly that's what they want to create.

50:06.860 --> 50:09.420
But the historian always tells you

50:09.420 --> 50:14.060
from where they start to where they finish,

50:14.060 --> 50:18.940
there is going to be a huge kind of a change.

50:18.940 --> 50:22.100
And in this particular case,

50:22.100 --> 50:25.220
I wouldn't be, I would very much hope

50:25.220 --> 50:28.140
that it's not going to be a revolution like 1979,

50:28.140 --> 50:29.260
Islamic revolution.

50:30.260 --> 50:33.100
And I have my hopes in that.

50:33.100 --> 50:35.340
For one thing, this is a revolution

50:35.340 --> 50:38.420
that doesn't have a leader, okay?

50:38.420 --> 50:41.420
And it seems that they're comfortable with that.

50:41.420 --> 50:43.340
At least so far, because we are,

50:43.340 --> 50:45.860
well, the sixth week of this movement

50:45.860 --> 50:48.100
and they hope it's not going to be actually a revolution

50:48.100 --> 50:49.900
as I pointed out before.

50:49.900 --> 50:53.540
I hope it's going to be more of a sense

50:53.540 --> 50:58.460
of trying to come to some compromise

50:58.460 --> 51:01.500
and gradually move toward change

51:01.500 --> 51:05.460
rather than a collapse of this regime

51:05.460 --> 51:07.700
and replacement with what?

51:07.700 --> 51:09.500
So the anxiety of the regime,

51:09.500 --> 51:14.300
you hope will turn into a kind of a realization

51:14.300 --> 51:18.020
that you have to modernize, you have to make progress,

51:18.940 --> 51:20.740
you actually have to make certain compromises

51:20.740 --> 51:23.420
or constitutional changes, all this kind of stuff.

51:23.420 --> 51:28.380
So the basic process of government and lawmaking.

51:28.380 --> 51:33.380
The problem is that they say we have it all, you know?

51:33.620 --> 51:36.420
We have our parliament, we have our constitution,

51:36.420 --> 51:41.420
we have our elections, which has all been, of course, fake.

51:41.460 --> 51:44.100
But they claim they have all of that.

51:44.100 --> 51:49.100
But the problem for them is that they try to superimpose

51:53.860 --> 51:58.860
a certain ideology, like all other ideological autocracies

52:01.420 --> 52:04.900
or autarchies, as in this case,

52:04.900 --> 52:09.900
that tend to dominate all these institution buildings

52:10.860 --> 52:14.460
that they have, and they constantly claim

52:14.460 --> 52:16.260
we have this, we have that.

52:16.260 --> 52:18.900
And of course, it's a generational thing.

52:19.860 --> 52:23.860
The upper echelons of this regime

52:24.900 --> 52:29.900
are mostly older people, turban, they are the clergy,

52:31.740 --> 52:36.100
that are afraid of the fact that they may lose their control

52:36.100 --> 52:39.140
over their whole system, that it was sophisticated,

52:39.140 --> 52:41.700
huge system of government.

52:41.700 --> 52:46.420
And they rely on certain tools of control,

52:46.420 --> 52:51.420
which is the Revolutionary Guards and other institutions

52:54.460 --> 52:57.940
that are loyal to the state.

52:57.940 --> 53:01.140
And they spend enormous amount of funds

53:01.140 --> 53:04.900
that is available to them at least before the sanctions.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.340
But even during the sanctions,

53:06.340 --> 53:10.260
they still have enough funds to do so.

53:10.260 --> 53:13.020
And in order to remain in power,

53:13.020 --> 53:16.700
and they're extremely ruthless in that regard.

53:16.700 --> 53:21.700
This is not a nice Islamic fatherly regime.

53:23.660 --> 53:27.820
This is a regime that I would see easily in it.

53:29.260 --> 53:34.260
Clear signs of fascism, clear signs of the state control

53:35.260 --> 53:38.460
and pay any price to stay in power.

53:38.460 --> 53:39.860
So even violence.

53:39.860 --> 53:41.540
Extreme violence.

53:41.540 --> 53:43.020
To return to the massacre,

53:43.020 --> 53:47.700
what were the uses of violence to suppress protests?

53:47.700 --> 53:50.660
Well, yes, it was actually quite remarkable

53:50.660 --> 53:54.660
to see that from the first or the second day of the protest,

53:54.660 --> 53:58.300
you see out in the streets this riot police, okay?

53:59.820 --> 54:02.340
Which comes out in large numbers.

54:03.020 --> 54:08.020
Fully geared up, their appearance are rather terrifying

54:09.300 --> 54:10.940
like any other riot police,

54:10.940 --> 54:13.900
probably more than any other riot police.

54:13.900 --> 54:15.380
They're violent.

54:16.660 --> 54:19.340
They stand in the streets

54:19.340 --> 54:21.980
when the students are demonstrating,

54:21.980 --> 54:23.740
even in smaller number.

54:23.740 --> 54:24.900
Because before I go to that,

54:24.900 --> 54:29.180
I should point this out to you as well,

54:29.180 --> 54:34.180
that these demonstrations are not large ones in one place.

54:36.340 --> 54:39.860
You don't see 100,000 people in one place.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.780
But you see in every neighborhood,

54:41.780 --> 54:46.380
couple of thousand of kids are demonstrating.

54:46.380 --> 54:47.900
All over Iran. All over Iran.

54:47.900 --> 54:50.060
Now all over the world in different parts.

54:50.060 --> 54:51.420
Yes, yes, yes.

54:51.420 --> 54:56.260
Actually, during the demonstrations three weeks ago,

54:56.780 --> 55:01.580
as I said, they had people in Sydney, Australia,

55:01.580 --> 55:04.660
New Zealand, Tokyo, all over the world.

55:04.660 --> 55:06.900
All protesting high gas prices.

55:06.900 --> 55:07.740
It's funny.

55:08.580 --> 55:09.780
Everywhere.

55:09.780 --> 55:10.620
Everywhere.

55:11.820 --> 55:14.700
To the extent that they could be ignored,

55:14.700 --> 55:17.220
nothing but if they could not be ignored.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.500
And it's actually quite remarkable

55:19.500 --> 55:21.780
that this is very embarrassing to them.

55:21.780 --> 55:24.940
But somehow they think that this propaganda machine

55:24.940 --> 55:26.340
of them is working.

55:26.340 --> 55:28.860
I'll say you think they don't have a good even sense.

55:28.860 --> 55:30.900
I mean, so there's an incompetence

55:30.900 --> 55:32.100
within the propaganda machine.

55:32.100 --> 55:32.940
Yes, it is.

55:32.940 --> 55:35.580
There's an incompetence across the board.

55:35.580 --> 55:40.580
I mean, despite all of this massive government

55:40.580 --> 55:42.820
administration or whatever you would call it,

55:42.820 --> 55:45.860
all these various components of it,

55:45.860 --> 55:50.860
there is a sense of inefficiency and incompetence

55:50.940 --> 55:54.100
that is associated within every action that you see.

55:54.100 --> 55:58.540
Even in their suppression of this street movement.

55:58.540 --> 56:00.980
But in answer to that question,

56:00.980 --> 56:05.620
you would see that this riot police,

56:08.180 --> 56:11.180
it's quite obvious that they were trained for the purpose.

56:11.180 --> 56:13.140
So their appearance, everything,

56:13.140 --> 56:17.060
these are not just regular army forces

56:17.060 --> 56:19.340
or soldiers, conscripts.

56:19.340 --> 56:22.300
They are professional forces.

56:22.300 --> 56:27.300
And they come not only on foot number,

56:27.660 --> 56:29.380
but they come on motorbikes.

56:29.380 --> 56:32.020
So there are, you would see any of these demonstrations

56:32.020 --> 56:37.020
are 10, 12, 15, 20 motorbikes with two passengers.

56:38.140 --> 56:42.060
One in front riding, the one in the back,

56:42.060 --> 56:46.580
fully equipped with a baton, with paint guns,

56:46.580 --> 56:50.700
with pellet guns and with bullets.

56:50.700 --> 56:54.900
So they are very fully equipped and they're terrifying.

56:54.900 --> 56:56.900
They go through the demonstrations

56:56.900 --> 56:59.220
and hit and beat people.

57:00.500 --> 57:03.020
And then the arrests.

57:03.020 --> 57:06.220
And then you see behind the first line

57:06.220 --> 57:08.020
of these riot police,

57:08.020 --> 57:12.260
you would see all this latest models

57:12.260 --> 57:17.260
of these special armored trucks

57:18.260 --> 57:21.940
for moving to the demonstrations

57:21.940 --> 57:26.180
and arresting people, throwing them into this.

57:26.180 --> 57:31.180
And then behind that, water cannons, you see.

57:31.420 --> 57:33.220
And I was looking at that and say,

57:33.220 --> 57:35.540
okay, this is Tehran probably.

57:35.540 --> 57:36.380
They have this.

57:36.380 --> 57:38.260
But then you look at the smallest cities,

57:38.260 --> 57:40.420
they still have the same thing.

57:40.420 --> 57:42.180
So all over the country,

57:42.180 --> 57:46.300
one thing that they had managed to produce extensively,

57:46.420 --> 57:49.820
irrespective of the fact that whether they are effective

57:49.820 --> 57:51.900
or not, but you see them everywhere.

57:51.900 --> 57:56.260
So it shows that how afraid this regime is.

57:56.260 --> 57:59.180
But that also shows that there's an infrastructure

58:00.300 --> 58:02.860
that can implement violence at scale.

58:02.860 --> 58:04.940
Yes, very much so.

58:04.940 --> 58:08.340
And it's probably part and parcel of this regime

58:08.340 --> 58:13.340
from day one, the number of prisons that they have

58:13.620 --> 58:18.620
according to perhaps an exaggerated version.

58:18.980 --> 58:23.980
They said that about 12,000 or so arrested

58:24.900 --> 58:29.700
that are in jails today since past six weeks.

58:29.700 --> 58:33.100
They were 230 or 40 people were killed,

58:33.100 --> 58:34.620
including children.

58:34.620 --> 58:37.660
I under 18.

58:37.660 --> 58:42.660
They are, they beat up,

58:43.260 --> 58:44.500
women in the street,

58:44.500 --> 58:49.060
which is extremely actually disturbing

58:49.060 --> 58:51.860
when you see these scenes of-

58:51.860 --> 58:54.260
So there's a lot of this is on video too, right?

58:54.260 --> 58:55.460
Everything is on video.

58:55.460 --> 58:57.260
Everybody has a camera

58:59.260 --> 59:04.260
and everybody sends to major news outlets outside Iran.

59:06.180 --> 59:08.700
And they immediately showed every night.

59:08.900 --> 59:12.860
If you look at BBC Persian or Iran International,

59:12.860 --> 59:16.540
or if you are, I think it is six of them actually.

59:16.540 --> 59:18.460
All over the earth in England,

59:18.460 --> 59:20.900
they are in Deutsche Welle in Germany,

59:22.140 --> 59:25.300
which has a particular interest in the Iranian.

59:25.300 --> 59:28.340
BBC World Service and so forth in London

59:28.340 --> 59:31.820
and Voice of America Persian here in this country.

59:31.820 --> 59:34.020
There is another one Radio Fado,

59:34.020 --> 59:37.820
which is also funded by the American government.

59:38.740 --> 59:42.180
Also fully covers all of these events.

59:42.180 --> 59:46.660
So there is no way that these people can,

59:46.660 --> 59:50.140
that the Iraq can miss what's going on in the streets

59:50.140 --> 59:54.660
of these demonstrations and the scenes of beating up women,

59:55.660 --> 59:57.860
which in Iranian culture,

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.660
as I presume in most cultures in the world,

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.220
there is a certain sanctity that you don't attack women,

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:06.300
but they do.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.500
And this is an Islamic regime

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:14.140
that supposedly have to have a certain sense of concern.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.100
And well, like a protection,

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.780
like a deep respect for women grounded

01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:25.020
in a tradition of protecting them,

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.220
but instead this kind of idea that was instilled in law

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.100
has turned into a deep disrespect of women.

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:33.140
Exactly.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:38.140
Or fear that these women are not any longer

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:43.620
the girls that we thought we are bringing up in this society.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.540
The source of you losing your power will be these women.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.420
That's the fear.

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.260
Yeah.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.060
And you see, of course,

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.340
this government do have a support base.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.500
I mean, it would be totally wrong to think

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.060
that the Islamic Republic has not created

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.540
its own power base.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.860
It does, but it's probably,

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:08.260
if there's no way there are no statistics

01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.140
that I'm not aware of,

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.820
any statistics that can give you numbers,

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.460
what's the percentage of support for the regime in Iran?

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.940
But quite frankly,

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.900
I don't think it's more than probably 10% of the population.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.380
Be very generous.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.300
I would be surprised if it's that low.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:28.780
I would say, so if my understanding,

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.340
because I've been very deeply paying attention

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:35.740
to the war in Ukraine, to Ukraine, to Russia,

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:41.580
and to support in Russia for Putin,

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.100
I think without knowing the details,

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.020
without even considering the effects of propaganda

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.380
and stuff like that,

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.900
is there's probably a large number of people in Iran

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:56.420
that don't see this as a battle of human rights,

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.980
but see it as a battle of conservatism,

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.060
like tradition versus modernization,

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:05.220
and they value tradition.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:09.180
What they fear from the throwing away of the hijab

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:11.460
is not the loss of power

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:14.020
and the women getting human rights.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.740
What they fear is the same stuff you fear

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:17.740
when you're sitting on a porch

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:21.420
and saying kids these days have no respect.

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:24.540
Basically, there's a large number of Iranians

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.860
that probably value tradition

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:31.020
and the beauty of the culture,

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.900
and they fear that kids with their internet

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.780
and their videos and their revolution

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.900
will throw away everything that made this country

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:44.140
hold together for millennia, right?

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.660
Yes, I agree with you in the sense

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.300
that probably like everywhere else in the world,

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.540
this is a generational thing.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.940
Every generation thinks differently

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.580
about the younger generation, no doubt,

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:58.540
and in Iran it's the same,

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.660
but there is another factor here is involved.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.660
Those that we would consider them as traditional

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.620
no longer seem to have their loyalties to this regime.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.980
That's powerful.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:16.980
Meaning that they consider it as a brutal regime

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.780
that is prepared to kill children in the streets

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.100
and does a lot of things wrong.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:32.100
Of course, it tries to take care of its own power base.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:36.260
There's a very strong sense, if we start here,

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:38.940
there's a very strong sense in this regime

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.660
that there are people that is theirs

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.420
and there are others which are not theirs.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.060
There's a word for it even in Persian.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.460
They call it Khodi, one of us, okay?

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.900
Oh, so that's very fascistic.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:56.940
Yes, yes, all for that matter,

01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.740
and I suppose Soviet Union,

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.340
if you were a member of the party,

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.740
and your children would have received

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.580
a special kind of treatment yourself as well.

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:14.820
This sense of us versus them for a while worked

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:20.980
because the younger people coming from the countryside

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:25.980
to the cities, certain sector of them would have found

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:32.340
protection and support from the government.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.020
They wanted to belong to something,

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.020
and the mosques and the morning associations

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:44.820
in the neighborhoods and so forth would have given them.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.140
There's actually a term for it.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.140
It's called Basiji.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:53.700
Those have been recruited by the state,

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.700
and this is the youth kind of vigilante, if you like,

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:02.780
that you can see them also in these demonstrations.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.540
Sometimes thugs, they're called the civil cloth.

01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:11.340
So the people that comes to these demonstrations

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:15.020
that start beating up these young people,

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:20.020
and they are not in security police uniforms,

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:24.860
but they are just regular cloth.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:29.860
And these people, yes, they still support,

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.700
and they still benefit because they get jobs,

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.980
they get privileges, and these are very important

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:42.980
for a state that basically monopolizes

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.900
most of the resources, you see?

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:52.900
Even during the sanction, let alone before the sanction,

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.500
the oil revenue of Iran, which is the major source

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.780
of the state government, was the monopoly of the state.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.380
It was monopoly of the state during the Pahlavi era

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:04.700
from the start, basically.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.260
So what does that mean?

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:09.140
That means that the regime in power

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:12.100
is no longer particularly accountable

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.100
to the majority population

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.020
because it extracts wealth from underground,

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.220
and it uses it for its own purposes

01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.460
in order to make it more powerful,

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:25.740
in order to make it more repressive

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.260
than what it is the regime today.

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.300
So it feeds a small, or I wouldn't say,

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.900
but a fair number of its own supporters.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.220
I mean, the revolutionary guard in Iran

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.820
is probably about 350,000 or something like that.

01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:44.980
It's a very big force.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.220
And this is not a regular army.

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:51.420
The revolutionary guards are independent from the army.

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.900
Revolutionary guard is armed forces controlled by the state.

01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:58.060
Yes, the same as the army,

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:03.060
but these are more ideologically tied up with the state.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.180
And they're also in-facing, internal-facing?

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.020
What's their purpose?

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.020
What's the stated purpose of the revolutionary guard?

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.300
Well, from day one, when the revolution succeeded,

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.140
the Islamic regime in power was vulnerable

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:24.140
to all kinds of forces of opposition within Iran itself.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.820
Prevent further revolution.

01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:28.260
Yeah, that's the revolutionary guards,

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.660
and their job was to try to make sure

01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:33.900
that the regime stays in power.

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:37.220
And of course, over the course of 40 years,

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.180
they became more powerful, more organized,

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.180
better funded, better trained.

01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.500
Well, at least we think they're better trained,

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.940
but we don't know because the level of incompetence

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.860
perhaps can be seen through the rank and file as well.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.860
But they developed their own military industry.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.500
I mean, those drones that you see now,

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.180
Putin's regime are throwing on Ukrainians,

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:12.020
poor Ukrainians, those are all built

01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.460
by the revolutionary guards, by the military industry

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:18.380
under the control of the revolutionary guards.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:23.180
And like similar regimes in the Middle East, at least,

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.180
these are military industrial complexes.

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.220
You can find them in Egypt, of course,

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.820
which is very powerful, very traditionally,

01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.620
has been in power and still is in power.

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:38.460
You find them in Pakistan, which is extremely powerful,

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.860
and they can change the prime ministers

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.180
as they did in the case of the last one.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:52.060
You can find them probably in Myanmar,

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:53.980
is the same phenomenon.

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.980
And if you look around, you can find quite a number of them.

01:08:58.980 --> 01:09:02.620
And the revolutionary guards is equivalent of that.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:07.620
This is a powerful establishment force

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:12.820
which militarily is powerful, industrially is powerful.

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:17.140
And since the start of the revolution,

01:09:17.140 --> 01:09:19.500
they have been given projects.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:23.820
So you want to build dams, which they did a major disaster,

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.060
environmental disaster.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.380
They built 100 and something dams all across the country.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:33.580
This is the revolutionary guard who does it.

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:38.020
So they have all kinds of tentacles

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:41.220
all around the country, controlling various things.

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:43.700
And because it's their job and they have power,

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:47.500
they have prestige, there's a huge incentive to-

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.500
Join them.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.260
To join them and to stay, so like they,

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.300
when they're having dinner at home with their families,

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:59.300
there's not an incentive to join the protests, sort of.

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.340
Well, that is the point.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:07.020
I think, the revolutionary guards may be an extreme,

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:11.100
but many of the people who depend on the state

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:14.900
for their support, now the younger generation

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.420
are telling their parents, you are wrong.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:21.980
You don't provide for us, this society,

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:25.580
this state does not provide what we want.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:30.340
So there is a dissent within the family, it seems to me.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.460
I hope it's not a wishful thinking.

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.820
You know, there is a kind of a joke going around.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:39.100
You see this, a terrible guy is the clergy,

01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:44.140
bearded and traditional clerical appearance.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.260
When you see them talking about women,

01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.420
they are very, of course, politically incorrect.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:56.460
They are very looking down towards women.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:00.380
As I said, you know, they have to be inside,

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:03.740
they have to be protected, they have not to be seen

01:11:03.740 --> 01:11:04.700
and so forth.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:07.780
But if they have a young person,

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.620
a young daughter in their family,

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.540
you see that their discourse changes.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.460
They no longer seem to be referring to women

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:21.260
as second class citizens.

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.100
Yeah.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.300
So that's very important.

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.500
That's precisely that point,

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.420
that when you have this younger generation,

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.180
no matter how privileged they are,

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:33.180
and many of them are privileged, you know.

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:37.660
And there is also, the regime has created

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.660
its own privileged class

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.740
that are not necessarily directly paid by the regime,

01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:53.420
but they benefit from contractors, certain professions

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:59.300
that benefit from what the state provides for them.

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:02.700
And Iran is, I mean, the past 40 years,

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.540
you can see Iran has developed

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.220
in terms of material culture remarkably.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:14.260
Iran has good communication, has roads all over the place.

01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:19.020
It's not like, it's more like,

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.300
I don't know whether you have ever visited Turkey,

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.420
for instance.

01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.700
In certain respects, even more advanced than Turkey,

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.460
but it's closer to that, rather than if you travel,

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.660
I don't want to bring particular names,

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.540
in North Africa, or parts of the Middle East,

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.220
or other parts of the Islamic world.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.820
It's much, much different.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:44.980
So in this respect, you would see certain contrasts

01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:48.220
or paradoxes here.

01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:51.220
On the certain respect, there's the growth,

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.540
and there is urbanization, there is modern economy.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.140
On the other hand, you see this superimposed

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:05.140
ideological, doctrinal aspect that has driven the regime

01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.100
over all these years.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.380
And they cannot get rid of it.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.140
They cannot, in this respect,

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:13.740
they cannot modernize themselves.

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:18.220
They think that they are already perfect

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.500
in ideological sense.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.020
This is the best solution for the world,

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.580
not only for Iran, but for the Muslim world,

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.300
and for the world as a whole.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:28.700
We are anti-imperialist.

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:32.780
We have managed to survive either under sanctions.

01:13:32.780 --> 01:13:34.460
This is all part of the rhetoric.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:38.780
But of course, at a huge expense,

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:41.580
the huge expense for their own population.

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.860
And the point that you have raised is the fact that

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:50.900
we now witness there is not only a generation gap

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.180
between the youth and their parents,

01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:59.860
but there is a break, in a sense,

01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.660
from the older generations.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.780
And they are very distinctly the youth

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.740
that has a different view of the world

01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.540
and does not want to compromise.

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:16.980
Whether they would be able to succeed or not

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:18.700
remains to be seen.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.220
Whether this regime is going to suppress it, maybe.

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.100
But it actually brought to surface

01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:32.940
many of aspects of the weaknesses of this regime in power.

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.780
Well, I hear from a lot of people

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.260
that are in these protests now,

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:40.780
and so my love goes to them and stay strong

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.340
because it's inspiring to see people

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.620
fighting for those things.

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:50.620
The women, life, and freedom, especially freedom.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.340
Because that can only lead to a good thing

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.660
in the long term, at least.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.060
And if possible, to avoid a violent revolution.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.180
Of course, that is something that we all want to see.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:08.020
Before we return to the present, let's jump around.

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.740
Let's go to the past.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:12.460
We mentioned 1979.

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:15.380
What happened in 1979 in Iran?

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:20.380
Well, in 1979, there was a revolution

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.500
that eventually came to be known as the Islamic Revolution.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.260
Even up to this day, many of the observers

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.180
or those who have strong views

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.100
that would not like to refer to it

01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:34.820
as an Islamic Revolution or even a revolution.

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:39.940
Because the nature of it in the earlier stages of it

01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:43.820
started really probably around 1977, it took two years.

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:47.620
Was much more all-embracing.

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.380
It was not Islamic in a particular fashion

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.460
or at all, in a sense.

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.700
It started with a kind of a very liberal,

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.500
Democrat agenda,

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:07.460
which required, which demanded mostly by people

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:11.980
who were the veterans of the older generations

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.300
of Iranian liberal nationalists

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:17.820
that were left out in the Pahlavi period.

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:22.820
It's a period of the Shah became increasingly authoritarian,

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.820
increasingly suppressive and therefore basically

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:39.580
leaving no space or no political space open

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.620
for any kind of a give and take,

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:45.940
any kind of a conversation or participation.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:46.780
That was in the 70s.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.500
70s, 70s, particularly in the 70s.

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:54.500
Can we actually even just do a world wind review

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.340
from 1906 to 1979?

01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.660
Okay, sure.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:04.100
In 1906, there was a period, actually as you might know,

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.940
the first decade or so of the 20th century

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:12.780
witnessed numerous what referred to as

01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:16.740
constitutional revolutions, including Russia in 1905,

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:20.380
the first revolution, including the Chinese revolution

01:17:20.380 --> 01:17:23.380
in 19, constitutional revolution in 1910,

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:26.060
the Young Tax Revolution in 1908

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.060
and the Iranian revolution in 1906.

01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:31.740
Do you understand why the synchronicity of all of it,

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.140
why in so many different places, very different cultures,

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:34.980
very different government?

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:37.900
Very different cultures, but all of them in a sense

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:42.900
were coming out of the regimes that became

01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:48.020
progressively powerful without having any kind

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.260
of a legal system that would protect the individual

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:55.620
vis-a-vis the state.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:59.620
So the idea of law and the constitution according

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:03.700
to which there should be a certain protection,

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:07.180
a certain civil society became very common.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.940
Yeah, but I wonder where that,

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.820
because that's been that way for a very, very long time.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:18.740
And so I wonder, it's funny, certain ideas,

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.060
just their time comes.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:24.100
Exactly, it's like 1848, when you would see

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.900
that there's a whole range of revolutions across Europe.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:33.100
Or you would see, for instance, the Arab Spring,

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:35.100
you see all these revolutions in the Arab world,

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.740
which unfortunately nearly all of them failed.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.940
So yes, these are very contagious ideas

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:46.780
that moves across frontiers from one culture to another.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.900
And I presume we can add to that,

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:51.540
there are two elements with which one can say

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:54.180
there was a greater communication,

01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:57.620
there is a greater sense of a world economy.

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:59.780
And the 10th of the century witnessed,

01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.260
the first decade of the century witnessed

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:07.260
a period of volatility, particularly in currency.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.020
So many of the countries of the world,

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:14.220
particularly non-West, suffered,

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:19.220
and particularly the businesses suffered.

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.060
And not surprisingly, the business class

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.540
were in the forefront of many of these

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.660
constitutional movements, requiring the state

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:34.660
to give the kind of a,

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:38.540
kind of a, create the right kind of institutions

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:42.020
to listen to their voices, to their concerns,

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:45.220
and the creation of a democratic system,

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.580
parliamentary and system in which

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.580
there would be representation, popular representation,

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.220
proper elections and so forth, and constitutions.

01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.700
And this very much is a kind of a French idea

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.900
of the constitution going back all the way perhaps

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:06.140
to 1789 revolution, Montesquieu,

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:11.140
all this kind of philosophy were greatly appreciated,

01:20:11.180 --> 01:20:12.780
particularly the French system.

01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.780
So what were the ideas in the 1906 Iranian constitution?

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.700
They precisely the same.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:23.260
They were demanding a creation of a legal system

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.700
with division of power between the three,

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:31.700
executive, legislative, and the judiciary.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:34.340
Not unlike the American system.

01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:39.340
And they requested basically a certain public space

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.580
to be created between the two sources of power.

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:50.580
The state, which had this kind of a control over the,

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:55.540
if you like, the secular aspect of life in the society,

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:59.660
and the religious establishment that had a full control

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:02.340
over the religious aspects.

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.380
And both of them from the perspective

01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:09.300
of the constitution is considered as repressive.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.740
And therefore there has to be a new space open

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.660
between these two.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.620
And that was the idea of a constitutional revolution.

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:20.780
By its very nature, it was an idea of modernity.

01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:22.940
They wanted a modern society.

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:26.420
They wanted a better material life.

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:30.580
They wanted more representation and so forth.

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:33.940
The constitutional revolution, as I always would say,

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:37.860
is much more of a innocent revolution.

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:40.260
It's a revolution that did not particularly

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:42.260
have much violence in it,

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.220
contrary to many other revolutions.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.060
It did not have a centralized leadership per se.

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:51.140
That's why actually I'm getting,

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:53.700
I mean, besides the practices,

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.420
I'm getting a lot of requests for interviews

01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:58.820
to compare what's happening now

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:02.500
with the revolution of 1906, 1909.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.940
Are there any echoes?

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:05.940
Yes, yes, there are, there are.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.060
Because that was a movement that started

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:13.060
without a centralized leadership.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:19.020
But actually various voices that emerged in various,

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.740
among the merchants or the businessmen

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:24.500
in the economic community,

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.100
among the representatives

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:30.900
who came to the first parliament, the press,

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.420
the new generation of the privileged aristocracy

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:40.420
who were educated and believed in the constitutional values.

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:44.020
All of these voices emerged at the same time.

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:48.020
And somehow they managed to co-exist

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:53.700
in the first and the second parliaments

01:22:56.260 --> 01:23:01.260
that were created between 1906 and 1910 or 1911.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.340
But they all faced huge problems

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:11.540
in the sense that Iran was in a dire economic situation.

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.020
This is before the days of the discovery of oil,

01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:17.060
which actually coincides with the discovery.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.980
There are two important coincidences.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:24.420
One is that the oil was discovered in the South in 1909

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.820
during the course of the constitutional revolution.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.020
The second is that in 1907,

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.140
the two great powers of the time,

01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:37.740
the Russian Empire and the British Empire

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:42.380
who always honored Iran as being a buffer state between them

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.900
because they didn't want to get too close to one another,

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:50.180
basically came to an agreement facing the fear

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.820
of the rise of the German Empire.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:55.260
So this is the period of Entente,

01:23:55.260 --> 01:23:57.540
as you might know, in European history,

01:23:57.540 --> 01:24:02.100
whereby the French, the British, and the Russians

01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.820
all create an alliance

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:10.220
that ultimately leads to the First World War against Germany.

01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:12.940
And at the same time, the discovery of oil,

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:17.980
the oil industry being a very powerful defining factor

01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.380
of the 20th century for Iran.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:20.340
Exactly.

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:22.140
Source of a lot of money.

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.100
A lot of money, but not all of it

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.420
in the hands of the Iranians.

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.860
Only one-fifth of it by way of royalties came to Iran.

01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:34.860
Much of it went to the Anglo-Persian oil company,

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.500
which they actually discovered the oil in the province,

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:41.780
who is a sub-province in the southwest of Iran,

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.740
where the major oil industry is today right now.

01:24:45.740 --> 01:24:50.740
And this is an extremely profitable enterprise

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.740
for that company and for the British government.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.300
It's actually purchased by the British government.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:59.900
Churchill purchased Anglo-Iranian oil company

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.620
for the British government.

01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.220
So it was not anymore a private company.

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:07.380
It was a British interest, as a matter of fact.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.100
And in the course of the 20th century,

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.180
although it helped the modernization in Iran,

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.540
but it also helped the creation

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:18.980
of a more authoritarian, more strong state,

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.900
if you like to call it.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:24.860
That 19th century Iran never had that kind of a power,

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.980
never had that kind of resources.

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.460
Is it 20th century?

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:32.180
Even that one-fifth of the income

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:36.140
that reached the Iranian state gave it a greater power.

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:38.900
That's another coincidence.

01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:43.540
So yes, yes, you could say the oil was one of the catalysts

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.740
for absolute power.

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.340
But the 20th century saw quite a few countries

01:25:51.340 --> 01:25:53.140
have dictators with power

01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:55.140
unlike anything else in human history.

01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.060
Yes.

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.740
That's weird too.

01:25:57.740 --> 01:25:59.220
Precisely.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.060
And you know, you can name them

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.780
from the beginning of the century with people like,

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:09.500
I don't know, Lenin or Stalin, of course, Hitler.

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.660
Mao.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.500
Mao, of course, you can name them.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.180
And probably, as I would say,

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:18.060
it's the last of them is Khomeini in that century,

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.660
that you would see these strong men

01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:25.660
with a sense of either artificial or real,

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:29.700
a sense of so-called charisma

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:34.700
and with this total power over the regime that they create.

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:38.700
Some of them do, Nasser,

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:42.100
he didn't have much of an oil resources in Egypt,

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:45.180
but he was also one of these strong men, okay,

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:49.140
in the 20th century, loved by some, hated by others.

01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:54.220
So it necessarily does not tie up

01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:59.220
to economic resources underground.

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.540
But in the Iranian case, unfortunately it did.

01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:07.620
And it was more than,

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:10.460
it created more than one issue for Iran.

01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:12.780
It's created a strong state,

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:17.100
which is the Pahlavi state from 1921 onward.

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:21.220
Because in 1921, at the end of the First World War,

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:24.900
Iran was in almost a state of total bankruptcy.

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:30.740
And the British had a desire to try to bring Iran

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:34.300
to the system that they created in the Middle East

01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:37.380
in the post-war era, the mandate system,

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:40.380
Palestine, Iraq, and then of course,

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:43.740
French mandate of Lebanon and Syria, all of this.

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.700
And Iran was separate because Iran was an independent country.

01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:50.260
It wasn't part of the Ottoman Empire that collapsed.

01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:52.540
So they had to somehow handle it.

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.260
And what they tried to do didn't work.

01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.340
As a result, partly domestic, partly international issues

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:07.740
wrote about a regime which is headed by

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:10.940
the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, Reza Shah.

01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:14.860
Okay, first a military officer called Reza Khan,

01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:18.060
actually a military officer of the Cossack forces.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:21.420
And the Cossack forces was the force that was created

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.020
in the 19th century model of the Russian Cossacks.

01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:30.020
When the ruler in the 19th century visited Russia

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:33.780
as in a royal tour, and the desire showed

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:38.460
the great Cossack forces that I like this.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.660
And he created one for himself

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:43.140
with Russian officers, actually.

01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.980
So the Russian officers served in Iran

01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:49.860
from around 1880s up to the revolution of 1917.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.980
The collapse of the Rezaist regime.

01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:53.260
So many revolutions.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.620
So many revolutions.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.780
And Reza Shah was an officer in that, Reza Khan,

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:00.300
was an officer in that force.

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.540
And he created a new monarchy for reasons

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.220
that we need not to go through.

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:05.900
And it's called the Pahlavi regime.

01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.900
Pahlavi regime was a modernizing regime, okay?

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.900
That brought, in effect, fulfilled many of the ambitions

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.700
of the constitution, many of the aspirations

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.340
of the constitutional revolution.

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:27.340
Better communication, secular education,

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.100
centralized states, centralized army,

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:38.420
better contact with the outside world, greater urbanization.

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.900
That's what a modern state is all about.

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.460
And in that regard, in a sense,

01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:48.260
for the first 20 years up to the Second World War

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.580
was successful.

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:54.180
Despite, and more significant of all,

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:57.740
it managed to keep the European powers,

01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:02.540
which was always interfering in the local affairs of Iran,

01:30:02.540 --> 01:30:03.740
in an arm length.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:06.660
So they were there in an arm length,

01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:12.620
but they were also respecting the power of the state.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.140
Power of the Pahlavi state.

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.420
During the Second World War,

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:23.420
the same phenomenon as earlier interference

01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:28.340
led to the occupation of Iran by the Allied forces.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.660
The British from the south, the Russians from the north.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.140
The Red Army, they took over Iran.

01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:36.300
And of course, they said-

01:30:36.300 --> 01:30:37.140
The New World War.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.380
Yes, from 1941 up to 1945.

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:45.300
And of course, when the Red Army

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:50.300
refused to withdraw from Iranian Azerbaijan

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:56.940
and with some thought of possible annexation

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:00.060
of that province,

01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:03.500
there was a big issue in the post-war Iran.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.180
So after 1945-

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:09.980
Yes, 1945 to 1946, there was a big-

01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.420
Soviet Union getting greedy.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.620
Yes, but eventually they agreed.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:18.020
Eventually Stalin agreed to leave the Azerbaijan province

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.420
in the hope that it would get some concessions from Iran,

01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:25.740
which in the oil of the Caspian era, area,

01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:26.980
which didn't work.

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.460
And it's a different story altogether.

01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:34.460
But what happened is that in the post-war era,

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:39.700
between 1944, 45 and 1950,

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:45.220
the C-3 is a period of greater democratization.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.460
Was that Reza Shah's dictatorship basically disappeared.

01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:57.180
And this is where you would see political parties,

01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.540
free press, a lot of chaotic really,

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.100
as democracies often are.

01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:07.380
So something like, was it officially a democracy?

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:08.860
Yes, it was a democracy.

01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.220
Was there elections?

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:11.180
There were elections.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:13.300
Yes, of course, yes, of course.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:18.100
And there were very diverse political tendencies

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:20.020
came to the picture,

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.820
including the to the party of Iran,

01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.900
which is communist party of Iran.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:25.100
This communist party of Iran

01:32:25.100 --> 01:32:28.540
is probably the biggest communist party

01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.300
of the whole of the Middle East.

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:34.020
And one of the biggest in the world actually, at that time.

01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:37.180
Did the Soviet Union have a significant influence on the-

01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:40.620
Of course, they were basically following orders

01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.180
from the Soviets, although they deny it.

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.780
But in reality, that's the case.

01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:49.140
But what happened, they were seen by the Americans

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:53.900
during the Cold War as a threat.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.940
And Iran was going through a period

01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:00.420
of demanding nationalization of its oil resources.

01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:03.140
That's a very important episode with Mosaddegh,

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.460
whom you might have heard about his name.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:08.700
Dr. Mohammad Mosaddegh was the prime minister

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:13.700
and the national charismatic leader from 1951 to 1953.

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.780
Prior to that, he was a famous parliamentarian.

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:20.500
But this period, he was the prime minister of Iran.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.500
And he nationalized the Iranian oil industry

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.420
and the British didn't like it at all.

01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:29.580
And eventually resulted in a famous coup,

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:34.820
which at least partly was supported

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:39.860
by the funding and by the moral support

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.540
of the British and the Americans,

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:44.580
particularly by the Americans.

01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:48.740
It was always seen as one of the earliest

01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:53.740
and the most successful CIA operations during the Cold War.

01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.420
So CIA had something to do with it?

01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.260
Yes, of course.

01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.620
That's one of the earliest operations of the CIA.

01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:01.500
Wait a minute, what was, yes, of course.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:03.980
What was the CIA doing?

01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:06.940
CIA, this is the time at the postwar era.

01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:07.900
In the 50s.

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.020
In the 50s, 40s and the 50s.

01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:16.020
The British Empire, which was really the major

01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.460
superpower of the region

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:20.700
after the collapse of the Tzarist Empire,

01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:25.700
gradually took the second seat to the Americans

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:29.500
who were the newcomers and the great powers

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.860
and the victors of the Second World War.

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.580
And the Americans viewed Iran as an important,

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:40.180
as an important country,

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:44.500
since it has the largest common borders

01:34:44.500 --> 01:34:45.780
with the Soviet Union.

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:51.260
And it was, I think the South was the Persian Gulf,

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:53.940
which at the time was the greatest

01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:00.820
supplier of oil to the outside world.

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:04.620
And therefore the Americans had a particular interest

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:05.740
in Iran.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.180
And in the earlier stages,

01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:10.180
their interest was in the interest of the Iranian government

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:15.180
because they wanted to get rid of both the Soviet Union,

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.260
which made the return in the postwar era.

01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:23.980
And of course the British that were gradually withdrawing

01:35:23.980 --> 01:35:25.020
from Iran.

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:29.700
But they had a full control over the Anglo-Iranian oil

01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:30.540
company.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:33.740
They changed the name to Anglo-Iranian oil company.

01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:35.740
When the name of the country officially changed

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:39.220
from Persia to Iran in the West,

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:42.860
the name of the company changed.

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.260
And they got into a huge dispute with the,

01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:49.180
was at the government that eventually led

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:52.060
to the coup of 1953,

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:57.060
which eventually created a very, very distressful memory

01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:03.180
in the minds of many of the Iranian nationalists

01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:06.100
that this was the betrayal of the great powers,

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.180
the British and Americans.

01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:12.660
Yes, CIA played a part because CIA feared,

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:14.740
contrary to the British that they were afraid

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:17.460
of their own oil in Iran,

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:22.220
the CIA was afraid of the Soviet penetration

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.260
in the South.

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.020
And particularly because there was a very powerful,

01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:29.740
a very powerful communist party in Iran,

01:36:29.740 --> 01:36:31.620
the two-day party of Iran.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:36.620
So they gradually shifted between the Truman administration

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.180
and Eisenhower administration.

01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.540
These are early days of the CIA.

01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:45.220
And then they actually did participate

01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:48.220
to send their agents.

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.740
There's a long story to that.

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:54.820
And it eventually resulted in a successful coup

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.140
that removed Mosaddegh from power.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:36:59.500
What's the United States interest here?

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:00.940
Why are they using CIA?

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.380
Are they trying to make sure

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:06.380
there's not too much centralization of power in this region?

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.380
They were afraid of the fact that the,

01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:12.860
that of the Soviet Union and during the Cold War,

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:15.180
that was their concern, only concern.

01:37:15.180 --> 01:37:17.980
They actually almost want to protect Iran

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.460
and its own sovereign processes

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:22.700
from the influence of the Soviets.

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:26.540
Because they were afraid of the fact if Iran,

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.020
or at least this is part of the,

01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:31.460
I'm simplifying a very complex picture.

01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.340
But the Americans basically were thinking

01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.140
that if Iran is going to be lost to Soviet influence,

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.460
then eventually basically all the resources

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.860
in the Persian Gulf are going to be threatened.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:52.580
And this would basically is the national security

01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:56.820
of the United States and all of the Western allies,

01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:58.380
European allies.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:02.660
So in a sense, this was the long arm of the CIA

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.660
to try to make sure that that's not going to happen.

01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:11.460
And then of course they were persuaded by the British.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.020
British were the old hand, which were in Iran

01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.580
since the beginning of the 19th century.

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:19.540
They always had relations with Iran and so forth.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:22.300
So they gradually replaced.

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:25.700
And of course I don't want to give them

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:30.460
this kind of a satanic view that American was a bad influence

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:33.860
because they had also some very good influences in Iraq.

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:38.860
But this particular episode somehow shed a dark light

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:43.220
on the American presence and was used

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:45.700
that abused time and again,

01:38:45.700 --> 01:38:48.780
particularly the revolution in 1979,

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.020
which was this great satan idea that Khomeini created

01:38:53.020 --> 01:38:57.140
basically was based on the fact is 1953,

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:59.500
you were responsible for the downfall

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.100
of a national government in Iran,

01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.820
which as a matter of fact, he had no respect for it.

01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:09.820
Khomeini had no respect for the secular national liberals,

01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:12.660
including Muhammad Musaddegh,

01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.060
but he was using it as a rhetorical tool

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:18.620
for his own purposes.

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:22.340
But what happened is that after 1953,

01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:28.500
we see again the rise of authoritarian

01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.940
Muhammad Reza Shah's power.

01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:33.540
And that he is, that's the Shah?

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.140
That's the Shah that we know as Shah.

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.820
This is son of Reza Shah.

01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:41.060
And technically what is Shah?

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:43.900
Shah is an old term in Persian

01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:49.380
that comes from a pre-Islamic Persian of ancient times.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:51.100
So in the context of democracy,

01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:54.740
should it be seen as like a supreme leader, king?

01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:58.300
Is the head of the executive power

01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.860
according to the constitution of 1906.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.300
Oh, that's in the constitution,

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.140
the actual term Shah.

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.620
Of course, he has a place in the constitution.

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:06.660
But the actual term Shah, okay, interesting.

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:08.820
But the Shah is a very old term.

01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.980
Yeah, it's almost like a monarchic term, like a king.

01:40:12.980 --> 01:40:16.940
Yeah, it is actually is a term peculiar to Iran.

01:40:16.940 --> 01:40:18.740
I've written about it somewhere.

01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:21.620
But because the term that the Western world

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:26.620
in the ancient times has been Rex for royalty and the king.

01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:30.300
In the Eastern world in India is Raj,

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:33.220
is the same origin, the same root.

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:34.540
Iran never shared that.

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:37.820
They had the idea of, because Rex and Raj,

01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:40.700
I don't want to get into too much of etymology,

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.940
but this is an interesting one.

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.820
Rex and Raj both means the one that opens the road

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:51.540
for basically enforcer of religion, okay?

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:56.620
Enforcer of the right religion.

01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:01.620
Because Rex and Raj both have the etymological origin

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.180
of right, you see?

01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:07.940
And right means the right religion, basically.

01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:10.660
By the way, there's so much beautiful language here.

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:14.300
You're just looking at the Persian constitution in 1906,

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.980
and it says it's the constitution

01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:20.940
of the sublime state of Persia, Qajar, Iran.

01:41:20.940 --> 01:41:24.580
I mean, just the extra adjectives on top of this stuff

01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:25.420
is beautiful.

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.340
Yeah, because that was actually the change that came about.

01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:31.660
I don't want to go too much into it.

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:34.700
But it was called, as I pointed out before,

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.460
the guarded domains of Iran.

01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.300
Yes.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:40.020
They changed that to the sublime state of Iran

01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.860
during the constitutional revolution.

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:44.580
Because they wanted to give a greater sense

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.420
of centrality of this state.

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.260
Yeah.

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.900
And sublime was the term we used.

01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:53.420
But also, what permeates all of this is a poetic,

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.580
I mean, there is a history of poetry.

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:56.420
Of course, very strong.

01:41:56.420 --> 01:41:58.740
To the culture, which is fascinating.

01:41:58.740 --> 01:42:01.500
So I mean, of course, I don't speak the language,

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:06.500
but even in Russian, there's also a music

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:10.620
to the soul of the people that represents itself,

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.620
that presents itself in the form of poetry and literature

01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:17.180
in the way that it doesn't in the English-speaking world.

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:18.140
I don't know what that is.

01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:19.100
There's a-

01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.500
Yes, there's a romantic side.

01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:22.780
Romantic side. Romantic side, that's right.

01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.020
Yeah, I agree with you.

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.220
In Iran, of course, there's a time

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.460
of the constitutional revolution is a time of great poetry.

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:35.380
This kind of patriotic sentiments

01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:39.460
that comes through poetry plays a very important part.

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:45.460
Of course, these days, poetry has kind of declined

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:50.100
and instead you see the visual image that is at the center.

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:52.020
That's why cinema is so important.

01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.700
Kids these days with their TikTok.

01:42:54.700 --> 01:42:57.540
Yeah, let me finish this about this period

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.020
of Bahamad Reza Shah.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:04.020
He built up because he received a greater income

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:09.820
from the oil revenue and he built up a very strong state

01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:14.820
with a strong security force, a strong security apparatus,

01:43:15.020 --> 01:43:19.420
which is the SAVAK, which is an acronym

01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:23.940
for the security force in security organization.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:28.940
And he, of course, unfortunately, in the 1960s and 70s,

01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:34.340
particularly 1970s, basically suppressed the voices

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:39.340
of or possibility of any kind of a mass participation

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:42.380
in the political process.

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.860
It became very much an authoritarian regime

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:49.860
with its own technocrats, very much a modernist vision

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:55.460
of Iran's future and almost kind of messianic

01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.100
that he was hoping that Iran in a decade

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.180
would become the fifth most powerful state in the world

01:44:03.180 --> 01:44:05.900
and the riches, as he would have said,

01:44:05.900 --> 01:44:08.780
the gates of the great civilization,

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:13.460
very much in the mind had this image of ancient Iran

01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.460
of the Achaemenid Empire.

01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:17.740
And we want to go back to that greatness

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:22.420
of the Achaemenid Empire, somewhat rather naive

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:25.740
and very nationalistic in a crude fashion.

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:28.340
And what happened is that as a result,

01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:31.300
there was built up some kind of a resistance

01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:34.300
from the intellectuals, from the left,

01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:38.980
eventually resulting in a kind of a protest movement,

01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:42.540
as I said, by 1977, 1978.

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.940
Then, of course, the question that comes to mind

01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:49.580
and that probably you would like to know about

01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.860
is the fact that white becomes religious,

01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:55.500
white become Islamic, if it's the popular,

01:44:57.020 --> 01:45:00.940
nationalist liberal tendency of opening up

01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:05.940
the political space and allowing greater participation

01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:12.620
going back to the constitution of 1906, 1907,

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.460
why it's all of a sudden it becomes Khomeini,

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.380
where does he come from?

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:22.420
The reason for that, at least in a concise fashion,

01:45:22.420 --> 01:45:27.420
is the fact that on one area that after the greater

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:35.260
suppression of all the other voices remained open

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:40.300
was religion, mosques, the mullahs on the pulpit

01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:47.180
and the message that gradually shifted

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:53.180
from the old traditional message of the Sharia of Islam,

01:45:54.220 --> 01:45:56.100
I mean, all the rules and regulations

01:45:56.100 --> 01:46:00.940
of how one has to live into something very political

01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:05.540
and not only political, but also radical political.

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:11.740
So in the whole period from the constitutional revolution

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:15.100
to the revolution of 1979,

01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:17.500
basically the religious establishment

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.900
gradually was pushed to the opposition.

01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.700
They were not originally very conservative,

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.700
supportive of the state as the Catholic Church,

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.660
for instance, was supportive of majority

01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:32.460
of the authoritarian governments around the world.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:39.020
But the politicization was the result of isolation

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:42.500
because they were left out of the system.

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:46.540
And while in isolation, they did not,

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:51.540
they were not successful in trying to reform themselves,

01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:56.100
to try to become, to try to find answers

01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:58.780
to many of the questions of modern times.

01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:00.180
What happens to women?

01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.940
What happens to civil rights?

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:05.020
What happens to a civil society?

01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:10.020
How modern law and individual freedoms

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:13.420
have to be defined in Islamic terms?

01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:16.260
How to separate religion and state?

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.980
Or how to separate religion and state?

01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:20.940
These issues were never addressed.

01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:25.220
What happened is that there was this bypass

01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:30.220
through political Islam and revolutionary Islam

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:34.260
as it gradually they learned, you know,

01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:37.460
that this is the bypass, bypass to power basically,

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:40.900
to become again a voice in the society

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:42.900
and eventually a prominent voice

01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.700
and eventually a monolithic voice in the society.

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.700
That's the process that led into the revolution of 1979.

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:56.180
Basically this period, greater attention was paid

01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:59.900
to religion even among the secular middle classes

01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:04.580
who were alienated for a very long time

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:08.060
because of this extensive modernization

01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:09.540
of the Pahlavi period.

01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:11.180
They had, they didn't have a sense

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:15.300
of that all the mullahs with their turbans

01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:19.460
but they became, they had a kind of aura in this period.

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:23.100
Yes, they are those who remained not corrupted.

01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:27.780
They are the people who basically went

01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:31.380
against the suppression of the Pahlavi regime

01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:35.020
and Khomeini became a leader, a symbol of that.

01:48:35.020 --> 01:48:38.140
Nobody ever thought in the earlier stages.

01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.500
And among these very excited multitudes

01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:46.500
that came to the streets of the Iranian cities in 1979

01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:52.140
or 1978 actually, thought that this old mullah in the 70s

01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:57.340
that all of a sudden has appeared

01:48:57.340 --> 01:49:02.340
from the Najaf through Paris to Tehran

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:06.940
is going to take over and create a autocracy,

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.860
a religious autocracy.

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:10.340
We have to back up for just a second.

01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.700
Who is Khomeini?

01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:17.500
You just mentioned a few disparate facts about the man.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.340
Yes.

01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.980
He was the person that took power in 1979,

01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:22.460
the supreme leader of Iran.

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:23.300
Yes.

01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:24.660
You mentioned something about Paris,

01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:26.300
something about being in the 70s.

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.300
Yes.

01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.100
What should we know about the guy?

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.700
Ayatollah Khomeini, who eventually was known as

01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:35.340
Imam Khomeini, he was kind of promoted

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:37.660
to an even more sublime position.

01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:40.580
Okay, can we, just a million tangents.

01:49:41.740 --> 01:49:45.220
Ayatollah, Imam, what do these terms mean?

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:49.540
Well, Ayatollah means the sign of God

01:49:51.180 --> 01:49:55.820
in the course of the 19th century or early 20th century

01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:58.940
as the religious establishment gradually lost

01:49:58.940 --> 01:50:02.860
its greater presence in the society

01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.420
and its prominent places in society,

01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:08.500
they had some kind of an inflation in titles.

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:12.060
So they gave themselves more grand titles.

01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:13.500
Yeah, more adjectives.

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.380
More adjectives, more grand titles such as Ayatollah

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:21.340
that became a kind of a highest rank

01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:23.620
of the religious hierarchy.

01:50:23.620 --> 01:50:24.460
But it's not.

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:27.580
The society was in unofficial hierarchy.

01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:31.660
It was not, it's not like the, like Catholic church

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:34.660
that you have, you know, bishops and, you know,

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:38.100
federal, it was very unofficial model.

01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:40.220
And he was an Ayatollah,

01:50:40.220 --> 01:50:43.660
was eventually recognized as an Ayatollah.

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:45.740
He wasn't the first Ayatollah?

01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.020
No, no, no, not at all.

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.900
The Ayatollahs were before him

01:50:48.900 --> 01:50:51.220
ever since the beginning of the century.

01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:56.140
But he was eventually recognized as an Ayatollah.

01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:59.580
And if I want to start it this way,

01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:04.580
Ayatollah Khomeini was born in 1900 and in a sense,

01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:09.820
all this tremendous change that Iran witnessed

01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:14.340
in the course of the 20th century

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:18.860
was in a sense materialized in this person.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.620
He become a mullah of a lower rank,

01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:26.340
went to the traditional madrasas,

01:51:26.340 --> 01:51:31.220
to the traditional centers for the education

01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:33.820
of the seminarians,

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:35.900
never had a secular education,

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:40.900
had a very complex Islamic education

01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.620
on this one hand jurisprudence,

01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:44.700
on the other hand, probably a little bit

01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:47.260
of Islamic philosophy and mysticism,

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:51.020
which is unusual for the jurists,

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:55.660
for the faqih, as they call them,

01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:00.660
these religious scholars or legal scholars of Islam.

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:05.220
And then he, in the 1960s,

01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:10.100
when he was residing in Tehran

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:13.660
and gradually becoming more important,

01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:18.140
he became a voice of opposition against the Shah.

01:52:18.140 --> 01:52:23.140
And the reason for opposition in the early 1960s

01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:29.180
was the fact that the Shah carried through a series

01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:34.180
of extensive modernization policies

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.660
of which the most important was the land reform.

01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.820
So in effect, the land distribution

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:45.300
that took place in the early 60s

01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:50.100
removed or weakened greatly that class of landowners

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:53.660
from the 19th century.

01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:58.660
And he, Khomeini, saw himself as a voice

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.220
of that old class that felt that actually declared

01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:10.420
that this land redistribution is un-Islamic

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:15.420
according to the Islamic law, property is honored,

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:22.940
and you cannot just, no matter how much

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.820
and how large are these estates

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:27.540
that the landowning class has,

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.980
the government has no right to redistribute it,

01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.940
even among the peasants,

01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:36.940
among the people who are tilling the land.

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:38.780
So that was a major issue.

01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:43.780
Shah also gave the right of vote to women,

01:53:49.020 --> 01:53:51.900
and that also he objected,

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:54.540
he said women should not have a right.

01:53:54.540 --> 01:53:58.100
Can we just linger on the Islamic law?

01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.020
How firm and clear is the Islamic law

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.940
that he was representing and embodying?

01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:06.740
Is this...

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.580
Codified?

01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:10.100
Codified, yes, that's a good term.

01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.860
That's another issue.

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:16.860
Not only the hierarchy was unofficial and informal

01:54:16.900 --> 01:54:21.900
but also Islamic law, particularly Shi'i law,

01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:28.580
did not have any codified system

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:33.780
because these religious authorities always resisted

01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:38.660
becoming under an umbrella

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:42.820
of a more codified system of Islamic law

01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:45.540
because they were outside the state, in a sense.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:49.500
Civil law was in the hand of the religious establishment.

01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:52.900
They had their own courts independent of the state.

01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:55.340
But other matters of legal matters

01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:56.700
was in the hand of the government.

01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:59.820
There was a kind of a de facto division

01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.740
between these two institutions,

01:55:01.740 --> 01:55:04.700
state versus the religious establishment.

01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:06.900
Therefore, it was not codified.

01:55:06.900 --> 01:55:10.220
So he could declare that this is unofficial,

01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.700
or I'm sorry, illegal according to the Islamic law,

01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:17.180
that you would distribute the land to the peasants.

01:55:17.180 --> 01:55:20.580
And another mujtahid or another religious authority

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:22.620
would say no, no, it's perfectly fine

01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:26.260
because he would have a different reading of the law.

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.940
So that being in mind,

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.700
that adds to the complexity of the picture.

01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:35.580
He, in the 1963, there was a period of uprising

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.820
of the supporters of Ayatollah Khomeini.

01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:41.420
That was a turning point, in a sense,

01:55:41.420 --> 01:55:46.420
to try to politicize the religious supporters

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.900
of Ayatollah who were loyal to Ayatollah Khomeini.

01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:53.500
And in a sense, all the community

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.060
of more religiously orientated

01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:59.860
against the secular policies of the Shah

01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:03.940
and against, of course, the dictatorship of the Shah.

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.460
So that's where the religious movement

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.300
became a political party.

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:09.140
Became, in 1963 is the first moment,

01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.940
it's a huge uprising.

01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:12.660
And the government suppressed it.

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:17.940
But then suppression would start to build.

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:19.180
Of course.

01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:21.660
And he was sent to exile.

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.900
He went to Najaf, which is this great center in southern.

01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:26.820
So he became a martyr on top of this.

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:31.820
That martyr, he was probably even forgotten to some extent.

01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:37.100
But not, it was forgotten for the secular middle class,

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.740
but not to those supporters of his

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.220
who were paying him their dues.

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.220
Because in Islam, you would pay dues to religious leaders.

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:53.060
There's religious dues and alms

01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:56.540
that you could pay to the clerical authorities.

01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:59.660
And they redistribute them among their own students

01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:00.500
and so forth.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:02.980
So they built actually a network of loyalty

01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:06.060
based on these donations.

01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:10.020
And these donations that's received by Atollah Khomeini

01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:13.300
was very effectively through his network,

01:57:13.300 --> 01:57:17.740
was distributed, even if he was in exile at Sadi Ra.

01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:23.660
So in 1977, 1978, when the situation changed

01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:28.540
and there was a little bit of opening

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:30.100
in the political climate,

01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:34.660
then you saw that Atollah Khomeini

01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:39.340
start sending cassette messages.

01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:41.700
That was his mean of communication.

01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.780
Was sending cassettes and cassettes were sent

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:48.180
through the country by his network.

01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:52.100
So all declarations and saying first

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:57.020
that we would like to see a greater democratization.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:58:02.020
And the Shah has to abide by the constitution of 1907.

01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:05.740
This is a constitution.

01:58:05.740 --> 01:58:07.620
This is a democratic system and so forth.

01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:09.020
Was he charismatic?

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:11.020
Well, it depends who would call,

01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:12.380
what do you call charismatic?

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:13.500
He had the long beard.

01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:18.500
He was kind of a man in turban and the gown,

01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:23.060
which was a very unusual leadership

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.620
for people who were much more accustomed

01:58:26.620 --> 01:58:29.900
to the civilian clothing or to the equipments

01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:33.460
of the Shah's military uniforms that he used to wear.

01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:37.060
But I also mean he is a man that was able to take power

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:39.460
to become popular, sufficiently popular.

01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:43.180
So I would like, is it the ideas?

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:44.420
Is it an accident?

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:47.060
Or is it the man himself, the charisma?

01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:49.020
Or something about the man that led

01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.020
to this particular person basically changing

01:58:54.140 --> 01:58:56.740
the tide of history in this part of the world

01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:58.820
in a way that was unexpected?

01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.500
All the above that you mentioned.

01:59:01.500 --> 01:59:02.820
Or was it just the beard?

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.700
No, I think no, it's beyond the appearance.

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:10.060
Because the appearance greatly helps, as you know.

01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:13.220
In the 20th century, appearance is helpful.

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.340
Pictures for propaganda, for messaging.

01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:17.300
That's an important factor.

01:59:17.300 --> 01:59:21.660
And he was a kind of adamant

01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:27.860
and very severe in his own positions.

01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:34.380
He could appear very uncompromising.

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.780
And he had a sense of confidence, self-confidence

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:43.420
that virtually everybody else lacked.

01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:49.340
And he was a man of opportunity.

01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:54.180
As soon as he would see that a chance

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:58.700
and opportunity would open up, he would jump on it.

02:00:00.020 --> 02:00:02.060
And that's what he did basically.

02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:05.740
As more the political space opened,

02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:07.980
the weaknesses of the Shah's government

02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:09.780
became more evident.

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:13.340
His indecision became more evident.

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:17.500
His lack of confidence became more evident.

02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:19.900
Khomeini managed to move further

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.500
into the center of the movement

02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:26.980
because he was the only authority

02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:31.700
that had this network of support through the mosques,

02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:36.660
through the people who paid homage to him,

02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:40.180
who followed him, because there's a sense of following

02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:43.260
of the religious leader in Shiza.

02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.500
You are a follower of this authority,

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:47.580
you're a follower of that authority.

02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:52.580
And he's basically created an environment

02:00:53.420 --> 02:00:56.940
in which people looked upon him

02:00:56.940 --> 02:00:59.260
as a kind of a messianic figure

02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:05.220
that came to save Iran from what they considered

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:10.220
at the time the problems of dictatorship under the Shah.

02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:12.420
So there's not a suspicion about Islamic law

02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:13.820
being the primary law of the land?

02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:14.660
Not at all.

02:01:14.660 --> 02:01:17.140
People had very little sense

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.740
that what Islamic law is all about,

02:01:19.740 --> 02:01:23.220
because the secular education has left that

02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:26.340
into the old religious schools.

02:01:26.340 --> 02:01:30.140
This is not something that ordinary educated Iranian

02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:33.500
who goes to the universities is going to learn.

02:01:33.500 --> 02:01:35.780
Therefore, there is a sense of idealization

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:37.780
that there is something great there.

02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:42.460
And there were quite a number of intellectuals

02:01:42.460 --> 02:01:46.460
who also viewed this kind of an idea

02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:49.820
of they would refer to as West toxication,

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:53.780
that is this civilization of the West

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:57.980
that has brought with it all the modernity

02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:00.140
that we see around ourselves

02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:05.140
has enormous sinister features into it.

02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:10.140
And it has taken away from us our authenticity.

02:02:10.140 --> 02:02:13.140
That was the thing, that there is something authentic

02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.140
that should be protected.

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:20.140
And therefore, a man in that kind of a garb and appearance

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:25.700
seemed as a source for return to this originality

02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:30.780
of their own culture, authenticity of their own culture.

02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:34.780
And he perfectly, he was a man of his own culture.

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:39.780
He took advantage of that, that is Khomeini,

02:02:41.100 --> 02:02:44.460
took advantage of it and the circle around him

02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.100
at the expense of everybody else,

02:02:47.100 --> 02:02:52.060
which he managed in the course of 1979 to 1989,

02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:55.380
which he passed away, died in the 10 years

02:02:55.380 --> 02:02:59.180
during this period, managed to basically transform

02:03:00.020 --> 02:03:05.020
the Iranian society to create institutions

02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:11.100
of the Islamic Republic and to acquire himself

02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:15.780
the position of the guardian jurist.

02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.660
That was something completely new,

02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:20.700
it didn't ever exist before.

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:23.860
As a matter of fact, as you might know,

02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:28.460
the model of government that a religious establishment

02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:33.100
takes over the state is unprecedented

02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:35.580
throughout the course of Iranian history,

02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:38.780
throughout the course of the Islamic history, I would say.

02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:43.780
This is the first example and probably the only example

02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:49.100
of a regime that the religious establishment

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:52.820
that has always in the course of Iranian history,

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:55.940
ever since I would say probably at this 16th century,

02:03:55.940 --> 02:04:00.940
if not earlier, has been always separate from the state

02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:07.420
and always kind of collaborating with the state

02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:10.060
with the certain tensions in between the two of them.

02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:13.300
There were two, basically as they would call themselves,

02:04:13.300 --> 02:04:16.700
the two pillars of stability in the society.

02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:20.540
That situation changed for the first time

02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:23.340
the religious establishment took over

02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:25.300
the power of the state.

02:04:25.300 --> 02:04:28.860
And that's at the core of what we see today

02:04:28.860 --> 02:04:33.220
as a major issue for Iranian society.

02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:37.140
Because these are basically that old balance

02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:40.180
between the religion and the state,

02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:44.140
which was kind of a de facto separation

02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:48.820
of the authorities of the two has been violated.

02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:53.820
And now you have in power a theocracy in effect,

02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:59.300
which of course only in its appearance is theocracy.

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:02.620
Deep down, it's in my opinion,

02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:06.020
it's a brutal fascist regime that stays in power,

02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:10.460
but it has the appearance of religion into it.

02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:13.940
So this is really the story of the revolution.

02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:16.100
And as a result of that,

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:18.780
the Iranian middle classes greatly suffered.

02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:19.980
It's not without a reason

02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:23.020
that you see 4 million Iranians abroad

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:26.980
because basically the emergence of this new power

02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:31.980
gradually isolated or marginalized

02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:35.260
the secular middle class

02:05:35.260 --> 02:05:38.380
who could not survive under that regime

02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:43.380
and gradually moved out in the course of perhaps 30, 40 years.

02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:48.460
Up to now, Iran has the largest,

02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:51.100
I think I'm right to say so,

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.540
has the largest brain drain

02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:57.340
in any country in the world according to its population.

02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:59.740
So fascinating that,

02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:02.820
how much of a weird quirk of history is it

02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:07.820
that religion would take hold in a country?

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:12.620
Like, does it have to do with the individual?

02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:17.620
It seems like if we re-ran the 20th century a thousand times

02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:20.860
a thousand times,

02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.700
we would get the 79 revolution

02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:26.940
resulting in Islamic law

02:06:26.940 --> 02:06:31.940
like less than 1% of the time, it feels like, or no.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:33.620
Which percentage would you put up?

02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:36.980
Well, I think it has something to do

02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:40.500
with the very complex nature

02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:46.420
of how Iran evolved over a long period of time

02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:47.700
since the 16th century.

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:51.540
That's why if I would for a moment

02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:53.460
talk about what I have written,

02:06:53.460 --> 02:06:57.860
I've written a book that's called Iran and Modern History

02:06:57.860 --> 02:07:00.580
and it does not start in the 20th century,

02:07:00.580 --> 02:07:02.780
it starts in the 16th century

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:07.700
because that's what I've argued that this complex process

02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:09.580
that at the end of the day resulted

02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:12.380
in what we see around us today

02:07:12.380 --> 02:07:15.620
is something that was in making for a very long time.

02:07:15.700 --> 02:07:17.580
Religion was a big part of it.

02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:21.780
She and the Messiah complex.

02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:22.740
Exactly.

02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:27.060
The longing for this great vision of a great nation

02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:32.060
that somehow is the sublime nation

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:37.060
that can only be fully sublime through religion.

02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:41.540
Or at the time it was thought that it's true religion.

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:46.540
Ever since then, it's disillusionment with that image

02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:49.340
or at least a process of disillusionment.

02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:52.060
The outcome of it is what we see today.

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:55.020
Basically, that process of 40 years

02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:59.740
is a process of readjusting to the realities of the world.

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:04.740
That great moment of romantic success of a revolution,

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:08.500
like most revolutions of course,

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.540
that is going to change Iran

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:13.820
and bring this kind of a moment of greatness

02:08:13.820 --> 02:08:15.940
led into this great disappointment.

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:19.460
So it's a movement of the great disappointment in a sense.

02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:21.780
Like most messianic movements, by the way,

02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:23.260
messianic movements in general

02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:26.540
are always leading into great disappointments.

02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:31.540
But what I have here that perhaps should be added to it

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:37.140
that yes, it was a peculiarity of Iran

02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:41.180
as a society that had to experience

02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:47.180
this eventual encounter between religion and state.

02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:51.140
That's something to do with the nature of Shiaism.

02:08:51.140 --> 02:08:54.220
That's just one point that should be pointed out.

02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:57.420
Most of Sunni Islam don't have that kind of,

02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:00.060
I say most because there is something there.

02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:03.140
But Sunni Islam in general does not have

02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.420
that kind of an aspiration

02:09:05.420 --> 02:09:10.420
for the coming of a messianic leader.

02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:13.900
Shiaism does.

02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:18.060
Shiaism in its very shaping,

02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.740
particularly the way that it was set up in Iran,

02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:27.620
was a religion that has always this element of expectation

02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:32.620
to it for the coming of this messianic leader.

02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.180
Of course, I mean, between parenthesis,

02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.060
all societies look for messianic leaders

02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:42.540
and just look around us.

02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:45.140
But some societies more than others.

02:09:45.140 --> 02:09:46.220
There's certain culture,

02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:49.420
it might have to do with the romantic poetry

02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.500
that we mentioned earlier.

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:55.500
I mean, surely, I mean, not to draw to me in parallels,

02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:58.020
but with the Soviet Union, there is romanticism too.

02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:03.540
I mean, I don't know, it does maybe idealism.

02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:09.420
A sense of a savior who would bring you

02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:12.620
out of the misery that you're in.

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:19.540
And always looking for a third party

02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:23.380
to solve your issues.

02:10:23.380 --> 02:10:26.580
That's why probably this movement

02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:29.460
has a particular significance

02:10:29.460 --> 02:10:33.060
because it probably doesn't look for a messiah.

02:10:33.060 --> 02:10:34.900
Although I was talking to my brother

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:36.620
who is a historian also,

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.260
and he was saying perhaps the messiah of this movement

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:44.260
is that Masa Amini, the 22 year old girl that was killed.

02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:48.220
The seven martyred messiah,

02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:50.860
who is now leading a movement

02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:55.860
which no longer has that charismatic leadership with it.

02:10:57.380 --> 02:11:02.380
But yes, I would say that Iran has been the birthplace

02:11:03.380 --> 02:11:08.380
if I might say that of messianic aspirations.

02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:12.500
Going back to the ancient Zoroastrianism,

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:15.220
which is really the whole system

02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:18.060
that you see in major religions,

02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:21.060
at least so-called Western religions,

02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.060
it's Abrahamic religions,

02:11:23.980 --> 02:11:28.980
is parallel or perhaps influenced by Zoroastrianism

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:33.140
in which there is an idea of this world

02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:35.420
and the other world, there's a hereafter.

02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:38.780
There is an idea of a judgment at the end of the time.

02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:44.180
And there is a concept that there is a moment of justice

02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:48.940
that is going to come with the rise of a religious

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.340
or a charismatic figure.

02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:54.980
So it's a very old phenomenon in Iran, very old.

02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:57.700
And it's time and again repeated itself

02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:59.100
in the course of its history,

02:11:59.100 --> 02:12:04.060
but never as powerfully as it happened in 1979

02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:08.180
and never in the form of authority

02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:10.580
from within the religious establishment.

02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:13.700
It was always the dissent movements

02:12:13.740 --> 02:12:17.460
that were kind of antinomian.

02:12:17.460 --> 02:12:22.060
They were against the authority of the religious establishment.

02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:24.860
That changed in the 20th century.

02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:26.940
But the revolution in 1979,

02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:29.100
that change is still with us today.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:31.940
Can we just linger on,

02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:34.900
are there some practical

02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:40.140
games of power that occurred

02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:43.140
in the way that Stalin took power

02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:45.900
and held power in the early days?

02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.860
Is there something like this

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:50.660
in terms of the establishment of the Revolutionary Guard

02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:51.700
and all those kinds of stuff?

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:52.540
Yes.

02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:56.660
So the messianic figure has some support from the people,

02:12:56.660 --> 02:13:00.260
but does he have to crush his enemies in competition?

02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.940
It certainly did.

02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:07.700
Probably not, certainly not as brutal

02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:10.060
in terms of the victims.

02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.700
As you would see in Soviet Union under Stalin,

02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:18.700
who the bloodshed or the destruction of the population

02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:23.580
was far greater than what you would find

02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.940
in Iran of the Islamic Republic.

02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:27.980
It's uncomfortable.

02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:32.700
Perhaps I would find a greater parallel with Mao Zedong,

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:38.580
and particularly because China has a very strong

02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:41.900
messianic tradition since the ancient times.

02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:43.220
So they have something,

02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:46.460
and Mao appeared as a kind of a messianic figure.

02:13:47.740 --> 02:13:51.460
There I can see there is a parallel,

02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:55.620
but also you can see with any other authoritarian regime

02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:58.780
with a messianic figure at the head of it

02:13:58.780 --> 02:14:01.700
that it destroys all the other forces.

02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:04.060
So during the course of the first 10 years

02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:06.860
of the Islamic Revolution,

02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:11.740
it destroyed the liberal nationalist secular.

02:14:11.740 --> 02:14:16.660
It destroyed the guerrilla movements,

02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:19.780
some of them Islamic, some of them Marxist,

02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:23.780
who turned into political parties or tendencies

02:14:23.780 --> 02:14:26.860
in the course of the post-revolution in 1979.

02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:29.300
They were completely destroyed,

02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.980
and in a very brutal fashion.

02:14:31.980 --> 02:14:35.300
And their opposition,

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.580
even within the religious establishment,

02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:39.860
because it wasn't a uniform,

02:14:39.860 --> 02:14:42.980
there were many different tendencies.

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:47.540
Those that were opposed to the authority of Ayatollah Khomeini

02:14:47.540 --> 02:14:49.300
or now Imam Khomeini,

02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:53.500
meaning almost a sacred religious figure

02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.300
above the level of a religious authority.

02:14:58.300 --> 02:15:01.220
He's a saint kind of a figure.

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.900
Shiism has this idea of imams.

02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.820
There were 11 of them.

02:15:05.820 --> 02:15:10.340
The 12 is hidden and would come back at the end of the time.

02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:11.780
This is a messianic figure.

02:15:12.740 --> 02:15:17.740
So the title that was always used for them only in Shiism,

02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:21.420
never used for any other person.

02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:25.700
He is the first person in the revolution of 1979,

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:30.700
first referred to as deputy of imam,

02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:33.420
but the term deputy gradually disappeared

02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:35.740
and he became Imam Khomeini.

02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:37.220
That's his official title.

02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:39.980
I love human beings so much.

02:15:39.980 --> 02:15:41.700
It's so beautiful.

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:44.100
These titles that we give each other,

02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.620
it's marvelous to observe.

02:15:46.620 --> 02:15:49.380
You love it because you haven't been under that system.

02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:54.380
No, I love it in a very dark human kind of way.

02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:58.820
It caricatures itself.

02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:03.140
It's almost funny in its absurdity,

02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:07.260
if not for the evil that it has led to in human history.

02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:13.140
But also the fact that it's in fact fulfillment

02:16:13.140 --> 02:16:18.140
in a kind of completely unintended fashion.

02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:21.580
It's a fulfillment of that idea of a messiah

02:16:21.580 --> 02:16:23.100
that they've been fighting for.

02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:26.820
This imam which is in a hidden for a thousand years

02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.260
is here and not here.

02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:33.620
And therefore Khomeini would have in effect

02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:36.300
fulfilled those anticipations.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:38.620
But beyond that, I just give you one example

02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.100
I know that you may have other concerns,

02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:46.100
but when I say elimination at the end of the Iran-Iraq war

02:16:47.300 --> 02:16:50.540
by the direct order of Ayatollah Khomeini,

02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:54.980
a fatwa that he wrote, a group of prisoners.

02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:02.020
Who belonged to a variety of political parties,

02:17:03.180 --> 02:17:07.780
the left, religious left, majority of them,

02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:11.980
the left and the Marxist left and the religious left.

02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:16.180
In a matter of a few weeks or perhaps a few months,

02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.180
I'm not actually quite sure about the times back,

02:17:20.220 --> 02:17:24.780
in a series of these were people who have already been tried

02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:28.420
and they were given sentences.

02:17:28.420 --> 02:17:33.420
They were brought back before the summary trials

02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:38.540
of three judges or more, three, four of them.

02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:43.540
One of them is now the new president

02:17:44.420 --> 02:17:46.340
of the Islamic Republic, Raisi.

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:52.020
And they were given a quick summary sentences

02:17:52.020 --> 02:17:54.940
which meant execution.

02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:59.260
So something between probably six to 8,000

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:02.860
were executed in a matter of a month or two months,

02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:04.780
something like that.

02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.420
Mostly in Tehran, but also in provinces.

02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:13.860
And that remained an extraordinary trauma for the families,

02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:18.940
for those who had these kids, they're all young, all young.

02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:24.940
So this remains very much a kind of original sin

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:31.020
of the Islamic Republic that cannot get rid of.

02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:33.180
And it's in people's memories,

02:18:33.180 --> 02:18:37.260
they didn't allow them even the families

02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:42.260
to go and mourn their dead in an official cemetery

02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:44.740
which they created for them.

02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:49.740
Now the latest thing is that they put a huge concrete wall

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:53.180
around it so nobody would be able to get into it.

02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:58.180
So these all part of this extraordinary level of atrocity,

02:19:02.700 --> 02:19:06.660
brutality, that you see that the regime claimed

02:19:06.660 --> 02:19:11.060
that it comes with the morality of religion and Islam

02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:16.060
to bring back the justice and be more, in a sense,

02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:24.740
kind to people ended up with what it is in the memory

02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:26.700
of many of the people in Iran.

02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:29.060
So developing these fascistic tendencies.

02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:29.940
Very much so.

02:19:29.940 --> 02:19:33.020
Destroying minorities, Baha'i is one of them.

02:19:34.180 --> 02:19:36.940
Hundreds of Baha'is were without any reason,

02:19:36.940 --> 02:19:39.540
without any involvement, were picked up

02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:44.540
and executed, their properties were taken over,

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:47.940
their rights were taken away from them,

02:19:47.940 --> 02:19:49.660
even up to this day.

02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:51.260
This is the largest, by the way,

02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:53.380
religious minority in Iran.

02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:57.860
So you would see that in many areas,

02:19:57.860 --> 02:20:02.220
this acts very much as an, beyond authoritarian,

02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:04.420
it's a kind of really a fascistic regime.

02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:10.100
So Hamenei held power for 10 years

02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:14.900
and then took power the next supreme leader

02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:20.620
who is still the leader today for over 30 years.

02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:22.140
Who is he?

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:26.620
Well, he was one of the, this is Ali Hamenei.

02:20:26.620 --> 02:20:27.460
Ayatollah.

02:20:27.460 --> 02:20:29.020
Ayatollah Ali Hamenei.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:30.180
Imam one day, perhaps?

02:20:30.180 --> 02:20:35.180
No, well, they hesitated to use the term Imam for him.

02:20:36.380 --> 02:20:38.140
But in any other respect,

02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:42.580
he was given all of that adulation that they did to Hamenei.

02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:44.540
He is the guardian jurist.

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.420
That's what's important.

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:47.940
Because the guardian jurist

02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:50.460
in the constitution of the Islamic Republic

02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:54.140
is an authority that is above the state.

02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:58.300
He is not elected, quote unquote,

02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:02.540
because this is a divine authority.

02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:04.540
Although he has been designated

02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:08.700
by the group of deterrent, more or less like himself.

02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:12.980
And he has the full power

02:21:12.980 --> 02:21:17.980
over all institutions of the state.

02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:24.700
The army, the media, the economy,

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:29.700
every aspect of it, he acts like a shah.

02:21:30.940 --> 02:21:33.300
He acts like this authoritarian authority.

02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:36.380
Did that gradually develop or was that very early on?

02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:38.660
Well, that's part of the constitution

02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.700
of the Islamic Republic.

02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:42.620
The first constitution,

02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:47.060
the first draft of the constitution

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:50.860
did not have the authority of the guardian jurist.

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:55.860
But then it was added by Khomeini and his supporters.

02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.740
Are there actual in the constitution

02:21:57.740 --> 02:21:59.340
any limits to his power?

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:06.300
Yes, there is a council of the experts, so to say,

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:11.500
that would remove him from power.

02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:13.660
I think theoretically.

02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:17.660
But there's so much restrictions to that

02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:20.580
that I don't think it would have ever happened in reality.

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:22.140
In his case, at least.

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:24.740
But in terms of executive, to make decisions

02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:25.900
and all that kind of stuff,

02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:27.900
does he need to check with anybody?

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:28.740
No.

02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:34.540
He does check with his own advisors,

02:22:34.540 --> 02:22:39.540
but he doesn't have any constitutional obligation

02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.460
to check on the decisions that he's making.

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.660
So that's the supreme leader,

02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:50.380
but there's been presidents.

02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.900
And what's the role of the president?

02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:56.540
The president, in a sense, is the executive power

02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:01.260
under the Islamic Republic.

02:23:01.260 --> 02:23:05.900
There are three heads of powers.

02:23:05.900 --> 02:23:08.660
There is the president

02:23:08.660 --> 02:23:12.260
that presumably has the executive power.

02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:16.140
There is the head of the judiciary.

02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:21.140
And there is the head of the speaker of the parliament,

02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:25.860
Majlis, Islamic Majlis,

02:23:25.860 --> 02:23:29.220
which is the legislative.

02:23:29.220 --> 02:23:34.220
So there's the legislative, judiciary, and executive.

02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:38.380
Raisi, who is now the president,

02:23:38.380 --> 02:23:41.540
is the head of the executive.

02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:45.100
Above them is the supreme leader,

02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:47.340
or the guardian jurist.

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:49.100
Can you give me some insight?

02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:51.340
Because I, especially,

02:23:52.940 --> 02:23:54.980
I'm not exactly sure why,

02:23:54.980 --> 02:23:58.100
but the president Ahmadinejad

02:23:59.140 --> 02:24:03.660
is somebody I'm, as an American, really familiar with.

02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:05.060
Why is that exactly?

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:10.060
But why was a president the public-facing person

02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:13.980
to the world versus the supreme leader?

02:24:13.980 --> 02:24:17.620
Is that just an accident of a particular human's involved,

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:19.140
or is this by design?

02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:22.100
No, because the supreme leader tries to keep himself

02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:27.100
out of issues of everyday politics, supposedly.

02:24:27.580 --> 02:24:31.340
But therefore, he is not coming to the United Nations

02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:35.820
to give a speech during the session.

02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:40.340
But Mr. Ahmadinejad, who at the time was the president,

02:24:41.180 --> 02:24:46.180
would come and make outrageous statements.

02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:48.580
That's why you probably know something about him.

02:24:48.580 --> 02:24:50.500
So all of them make public statements,

02:24:50.500 --> 02:24:53.620
but he had a proclivity for outrageous statements.

02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:57.660
He does all kinds of things,

02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:00.100
he makes all kinds of statements,

02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:05.100
but he is somewhat above the everyday politics, in theory.

02:25:06.260 --> 02:25:09.420
But of course, he's pulling all the strings,

02:25:09.420 --> 02:25:12.340
without doubt, in every respect.

02:25:12.340 --> 02:25:15.020
And it seems that you were asked,

02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:17.860
I thought you were going to ask me this question,

02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:21.660
almost without an exception,

02:25:22.540 --> 02:25:27.540
since the inception of the Islamic Republic in 1979,

02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:31.140
up to the last of the presidents of the Islamic Republic,

02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:35.300
Rouhani, before the guy that is last year,

02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:39.900
or a year and a half ago, was in a four-year lecture,

02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:44.100
got into the position of the president.

02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:48.180
All of them, as a long list,

02:25:48.180 --> 02:25:53.100
all of them eventually fell out with the regime.

02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:57.340
So there is no president,

02:25:57.340 --> 02:25:59.420
except perhaps to some extent Rouhani,

02:25:59.420 --> 02:26:02.660
but we'll wait and see what's going to happen to him.

02:26:02.660 --> 02:26:06.460
But prior to him, all of them, including Ahmadinejad,

02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:09.420
fell out with the regime, with the current regime in Iran.

02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:10.500
Who's Rouhani?

02:26:10.500 --> 02:26:12.700
He was officially president for eight years.

02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:15.100
Yeah, prior to Raisi.

02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:17.940
Ibrahim Raisi, the 221,

02:26:17.940 --> 02:26:19.860
what you're saying is a phony election.

02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:21.060
Yes, it's a phony election.

02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:21.900
What happened?

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:23.860
What's interesting about what happened?

02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:28.860
Because the process of actually candidacy for presidency

02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:34.860
is completely controlled by a council

02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:40.180
that is under the control of the supreme leader.

02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:45.180
So they have to approve who is going to be the candidate.

02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:49.500
So not everybody can enter

02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:52.060
and say, I would like to be a candidate.

02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:54.420
So did Rouhani fall out of favor?

02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:55.460
You're saying there's some...

02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:59.340
Well, he is kind of out of favor now

02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:04.020
because he was more moderate than this most recent regime.

02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:07.740
But the point is that if you look,

02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:11.700
this is something almost institutional,

02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:14.860
constitutional to the regime.

02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:18.820
This is a regime that rejects all of the executive powers

02:27:21.100 --> 02:27:25.100
because the division between the supreme authority,

02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:27.500
as a place of a supreme authority,

02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:32.220
versus the presidency has problematic.

02:27:33.860 --> 02:27:38.860
It is as if there would be a supreme leader

02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:43.100
in the United States above all the three sources of power.

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:48.100
That's the kind of view that we can see in today's Iran.

02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:52.180
And of course, he is at the focus of all the criticism

02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:57.060
that he receives from the demonstrators in today's Iran.

02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:01.980
So on top of all this,

02:28:02.900 --> 02:28:05.660
recently and throughout the last several years,

02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:10.660
US and Iran are in the midst of nuclear deal negotiations.

02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:14.060
This is another part of the story of Iran,

02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:17.700
is the development of nuclear weapons,

02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:20.460
the nuclear program.

02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:22.740
They're looking to restore the nuclear deal

02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:27.100
known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA.

02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:31.380
What is the history, the present and the future

02:28:31.380 --> 02:28:34.700
of these negotiations over nuclear weapons?

02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:37.340
What is interesting to you in this full context

02:28:37.340 --> 02:28:41.300
from the 16th century of the messianic journey?

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:46.060
What's interesting to you here?

02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:51.060
You can argue that for a long time, even under the Shah,

02:28:51.420 --> 02:28:56.420
but much more expressively and decisively

02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:59.020
under the Islamic Republic,

02:28:59.020 --> 02:29:04.020
there was a determination to have a nuclear power

02:29:07.260 --> 02:29:10.220
or nuclear weapon in a sense.

02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:13.820
I think the bottom line of all the negotiations,

02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:18.180
everything else is that Iran of the Islamic Republic

02:29:18.180 --> 02:29:23.180
had the tendency of having its own nuclear weapon.

02:29:23.260 --> 02:29:27.020
The reason for that is that Iran was subject

02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:30.740
of nearly nine years, eight and a half years

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:35.740
of Iran-Iraq war when not only Iran faced an aggressor,

02:29:36.660 --> 02:29:40.260
not only Iran faced an aggressor, Iraq,

02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:43.900
that actually attacked Iran at a very critical time

02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:46.700
at the very beginning of the Iranian Revolution,

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:52.620
but the fact that Iran felt kind of a helpless

02:29:53.660 --> 02:29:58.660
in the course of this war and has to make great sacrifices

02:29:58.940 --> 02:30:01.740
actually, which supported the Islamic regime

02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:04.860
and consolidated the Islamic regime

02:30:04.860 --> 02:30:06.820
because of this war.

02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:11.820
And most of the time, the support of the United States

02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:16.700
was behind Iraq vis-a-vis Iran.

02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:22.140
And Iran felt that it's been isolated

02:30:22.140 --> 02:30:25.140
and has to protect itself.

02:30:25.140 --> 02:30:30.140
So there is some argument for having a nuclear capabilities,

02:30:30.140 --> 02:30:35.140
nuclear capabilities, but in reality,

02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:40.180
this has resulted in a completely mindless, crazy,

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:46.700
a wasteful attempt on the side of the Iranian regime

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:51.020
to try to develop a nuclear power.

02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:53.220
And therefore the rest of the world,

02:30:53.220 --> 02:30:57.340
particularly in this region, they're very worried

02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:02.340
that if Iran would get access to a nuclear weapon,

02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:07.060
then the entire region of the Persian Gulf might,

02:31:07.060 --> 02:31:12.060
particularly Saudi Arabia, possibly Turkey, possibly Egypt,

02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:16.700
all of them may require, may demand

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:20.700
to have also nuclear weapon, given the fact that Pakistan

02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:22.660
and India has already have it.

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:27.660
So there was a determined attempt, as you might know,

02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:29.980
on the side of the Western communities

02:31:29.980 --> 02:31:33.740
or now gradually world communities to try to,

02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:37.300
as much as possible, to control Iran

02:31:37.300 --> 02:31:41.860
from getting access to a nuclear capability,

02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:45.460
or actually limit Iran's nuclear capabilities

02:31:45.460 --> 02:31:49.180
to what was defined usually in a euphemism

02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:51.540
as a peaceful fashion.

02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:52.580
Okay.

02:31:53.620 --> 02:31:57.020
That being said, there was also Israel,

02:31:59.020 --> 02:32:03.620
which viewed the Islamic Republic as a arch enemy.

02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:10.260
And some of it might be due to the Israelis' own exaggeration

02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:15.060
of Iran's threat.

02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:18.220
And some of it is because Iran has developed

02:32:18.220 --> 02:32:21.980
a fairly strong military, as we see today.

02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:28.340
And as such, this attempt to try to prevent Iran

02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:33.020
from ever getting access to a nuclear weapon,

02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:39.980
which resulted, as you might know, in this massive sanctions

02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:45.140
that were imposed upon Iran ever since the beginning

02:32:45.380 --> 02:32:47.780
of the revolution in 1979.

02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:52.780
And of course, more intensively since 2015, 2016,

02:32:53.860 --> 02:32:56.420
even prior to that, probably a little bit earlier.

02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:01.020
This agreement, the nuclear agreement,

02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:05.900
was supposed to control or monitor

02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:10.900
Iranian nuclear industry or nuclear set up

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:16.340
in exchange for removing the sanctions.

02:33:17.340 --> 02:33:20.460
But this never worked, in a matter of fact,

02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:25.460
in a very successful, satisfactory way

02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:28.780
for the Iranians or for the Americans,

02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:31.660
particularly under Trump administration,

02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:36.660
which I think foolishly decided to scrap the agreement

02:33:38.780 --> 02:33:41.860
that was reached under President Obama,

02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:45.300
like many other policies that was implemented

02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:50.140
under Trump administration, this created a major problem.

02:33:50.140 --> 02:33:55.140
That is how to, under Biden, how to try to come up

02:33:56.420 --> 02:34:01.420
with a new nuclear agreement with Iran.

02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:05.460
In this process, since 2016,

02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:10.460
where the United States withdrew from the agreement,

02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:14.940
Iran felt comfortable to try to go

02:34:14.940 --> 02:34:18.940
and do whatever they want without any kind of monitor,

02:34:18.940 --> 02:34:21.700
being monitored by the international community.

02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:25.500
And that's the situation now.

02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:30.140
We don't know whether Iran is really sincere

02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:35.140
under the present regime to negotiate a deal.

02:34:35.380 --> 02:34:40.380
We don't know that the United States is willing to do so.

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:45.980
And it seems that now what is happening

02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:49.260
in terms of the protests in the Iranian streets

02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:54.260
makes it even harder in a public eye

02:34:55.220 --> 02:34:59.660
to try to negotiate a deal with Iran,

02:34:59.660 --> 02:35:02.660
because that means in the minds of many,

02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:06.500
and with some justification,

02:35:06.500 --> 02:35:11.500
that if the nuclear agreement would result

02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:16.420
in the removal of many of these sanctions,

02:35:16.420 --> 02:35:21.420
millions, billions, as a result of the removal

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:26.380
of the sanctions and Iran's ability to sell it,

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:28.460
its oil in the international market

02:35:28.460 --> 02:35:33.460
without any restrictions means that the Iranian government

02:35:33.660 --> 02:35:38.660
is going to become even more powerful,

02:35:38.660 --> 02:35:43.460
more financially secure in order to suppress its own people.

02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:48.460
So that's the agreement that goes against coming to terms

02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:52.180
with Iran.

02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:57.180
But the problem is that there is no clear alternative,

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:00.620
even I'm not particularly personally favorable

02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:05.380
for this agreement to be ratified.

02:36:05.380 --> 02:36:07.860
But the alternative is very difficult.

02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:11.260
There is no way to try to see what can be done.

02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:17.500
Geopolitics where every alternative is terrible.

02:36:19.140 --> 02:36:23.780
Let me ask you about one of the most complex

02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:26.800
geopolitical situations in history.

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:32.400
One aspect of it is the Cold War between Iran and Israel.

02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:35.640
The bigger picture of it is sometimes referred to

02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:39.240
as Israel-Palestine conflict.

02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:46.080
What are all the parties, nations involved?

02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.600
What are the interests that are involved?

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:49.880
What's the rhetoric?

02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:54.600
Can you understand, make the case

02:36:54.600 --> 02:36:56.720
for each side of this conflict?

02:36:57.800 --> 02:37:00.920
You're opening a new can of worms

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:05.800
that it takes another three hours of conversation.

02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:07.640
Just three hours?

02:37:07.640 --> 02:37:09.320
At least.

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:11.920
What I can tell you is this.

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:19.200
Iran prior to 1979 viewed itself under the Shah

02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:25.380
as a kind of a, if not supporter of Israel,

02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:29.380
was in very good terms with Israel.

02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:33.540
They had an embassy in Iran or unofficial embassy in Iran.

02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:36.980
They had certain projects that helping with the agriculture

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.100
and so forth in Iran.

02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:44.420
But since 1979, that completely reversed.

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:51.060
Part of it is that the issue of the Palestinian plight

02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:55.260
remained very much at the heart

02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:59.500
of the revolutionary Iranians who would see

02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:04.500
that part of the United States is to support,

02:38:05.140 --> 02:38:08.100
part of the United States guilt,

02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:13.100
sin is to support Israel vis-a-vis, it's very suppressive,

02:38:14.100 --> 02:38:19.100
very oppressive treatment of the Palestinians,

02:38:25.300 --> 02:38:29.620
completely illegal taking over of the territories

02:38:29.620 --> 02:38:32.780
which is not theirs since 1967.

02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:37.460
And therefore it is upon the Iranian regime,

02:38:37.460 --> 02:38:40.860
Iranian Islamic Republic to support

02:38:40.860 --> 02:38:42.740
the cause of the Palestinians.

02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:48.500
This came about at the time when the rest of the support

02:38:50.140 --> 02:38:54.060
for the Palestinians, including Arab nationalism,

02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:58.580
basically reached a stage of bankruptcy.

02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:02.380
I mean, much of the regimes of the Arab world

02:39:02.380 --> 02:39:05.540
either are now coming to terms with Israel

02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:09.460
or in one way or another because of their own contingencies,

02:39:09.460 --> 02:39:14.060
because of their own concerns and interests

02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:19.060
are really nearly accepting Israel in the region.

02:39:21.260 --> 02:39:25.980
Now, that old task of rhetorically supporting

02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:29.500
the Palestinians falls upon the Islamic Republic

02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.580
that sees itself as a champion of the Palestinians now.

02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:36.740
Without as a matter of fact,

02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:39.420
having either the support of the Iranian people

02:39:40.380 --> 02:39:42.340
or the support behind him, if you ask,

02:39:42.340 --> 02:39:47.100
if tomorrow there would be a poll or a referendum,

02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:52.100
I would doubt that 80% of the Iranian people

02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:55.580
would approve of the policies of the Islamic Republic

02:39:55.580 --> 02:39:57.460
vis-a-vis the issue of Palestine.

02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:02.060
Nor the Palestinians themselves

02:40:02.060 --> 02:40:05.860
because the Islamic Republic is only supporting

02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:09.940
within the Palestinian movement,

02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:12.540
which are Islamic, quote unquote.

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:16.180
And even within that, there is problems with Hamas,

02:40:16.180 --> 02:40:17.740
for instance.

02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:21.740
But nevertheless, it's for the Islamic Republic

02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:24.980
some kind of a propaganda tool

02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:28.300
to be able to use it for its own sake

02:40:28.300 --> 02:40:31.940
and claim that we are the champions

02:40:31.940 --> 02:40:34.220
of the Palestinian people.

02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:37.860
Whether they have a solution,

02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:41.380
if you look at the rhetoric, if you listen to the rhetoric,

02:40:41.380 --> 02:40:46.100
it's the destruction of the State of Israel.

02:40:46.100 --> 02:40:51.100
And that, it seems to me, creates a certain anxiety

02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:57.060
in the minds of the Israelis, Israeli population,

02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:58.860
and Israeli government,

02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:02.660
particularly those who are now in power.

02:41:02.660 --> 02:41:05.180
Netanyahu, the Likud,

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:09.820
and more kind of a right-wing politics of,

02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:12.820
policy of today's Israel.

02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:19.100
That being said, I think also the Israelis

02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:22.660
try to get an extra mileage out of

02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:27.780
threat of Iran, quote unquote,

02:41:27.780 --> 02:41:32.340
in order to present themselves

02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:37.580
rightful for terms of security and whatever else.

02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:40.940
The way that they're treating the Palestinians,

02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:43.420
which I think is extremely unjust.

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:47.900
I think it's extremely unwise for Israel

02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:49.700
to carry on with these policies

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:53.140
as they did since 1967, at least,

02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:55.340
and not to try to come to terms with it.

02:41:55.340 --> 02:41:57.620
Of course, there's a huge amount of,

02:41:57.620 --> 02:41:59.620
I'm not denying that at all,

02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:04.620
there's a huge amount of failures,

02:42:05.460 --> 02:42:09.900
mistakes, and stupidity on the side

02:42:09.900 --> 02:42:14.460
of the Palestinian leadership in various stages,

02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:17.900
not to try to make a deal

02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:22.020
or try to come to terms in some fashion.

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:24.260
But it's a very complex picture,

02:42:24.260 --> 02:42:27.900
and it's rather unfair to the Palestinians

02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:32.340
to accuse them for not coming to terms with Israel

02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:36.060
under a very uneven circumstances

02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:39.420
when they are not in a position to try

02:42:39.420 --> 02:42:43.940
to make a fair deal in terms of the territories

02:42:43.940 --> 02:42:48.260
or in terms of their security in future vis-a-vis Israel.

02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:50.900
So I think there is, as you probably know,

02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:53.260
quite a lot of people that would

02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:56.060
have a different perspective than you just stated

02:42:56.100 --> 02:43:01.100
in terms of taking the perspective of Israel

02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:04.860
in characterizing the situation.

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:07.700
Can you steelman their side?

02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:09.740
Can you steelman Israel's side

02:43:09.740 --> 02:43:13.060
that they're trying to be a sovereign nation,

02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:16.620
trying to protect themselves against threats,

02:43:16.620 --> 02:43:21.620
ultimately wanting to create a place of safety,

02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:24.380
a place where people can pursue

02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:27.580
all the things that you want to pursue in life,

02:43:27.580 --> 02:43:30.900
including foremost happiness?

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:32.980
I tend to agree with you,

02:43:32.980 --> 02:43:35.140
and I have all the respect for the fact

02:43:35.140 --> 02:43:39.340
that Israel would like to create security

02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:41.340
and happiness for its own people.

02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:43.620
But there are two arguments.

02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:45.900
One is a moral argument.

02:43:45.900 --> 02:43:47.940
To my mind as a historian,

02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:53.700
Jews across around the world

02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:56.020
for all through their history suffered.

02:43:57.020 --> 02:43:59.380
And this is a history of suffering.

02:43:59.380 --> 02:44:01.860
It's a history of memory of suffering.

02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:05.460
And I find it enormously difficult to believe

02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:09.540
that a nation that's the product of so much

02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:15.820
sacrifice, suffering, loss of life,

02:44:18.020 --> 02:44:22.060
and variety of Holocaust above all,

02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:25.980
would find itself in a position

02:44:25.980 --> 02:44:28.860
not to give the proper justice

02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:31.260
to a people who could be their neighbors.

02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:37.700
And that is a moral argument which I cannot believe

02:44:37.740 --> 02:44:40.620
under any circumstances can be accepted.

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:43.540
Second, in real terms,

02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:47.820
what do you want to, you want to commit a genocide?

02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:50.420
Do you have a population there

02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:52.820
that you have to come to terms with it?

02:44:52.820 --> 02:44:56.740
And you cannot just postpone as they did.

02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:59.580
Since 67, they're postponing and hoping

02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:01.740
that it goes away somehow.

02:45:03.620 --> 02:45:05.380
I don't think it's going to go away.

02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:11.500
And it's going to get worse rather than better.

02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.300
It's a long, nuanced discussion,

02:45:13.300 --> 02:45:15.660
and I look forward to having it.

02:45:15.660 --> 02:45:20.660
So we'll just leave it there for the moment.

02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:27.780
But it is a stressful place in the world

02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:33.100
where the rhetoric is existential,

02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:38.100
where Iran makes claims that it wants to wipe

02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:40.180
a country off the face of the earth.

02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.740
It's just the level of intensity of rhetoric

02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.820
is unlike anywhere else in the world.

02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.740
And extremely dangerous.

02:45:48.740 --> 02:45:50.340
And in both directions.

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:54.260
So one, the real danger of the rhetoric

02:45:54.260 --> 02:45:56.980
actually being acted upon,

02:45:56.980 --> 02:46:01.220
and then the extreme political parties

02:46:01.220 --> 02:46:06.220
using the rhetoric to justify even a greater escalation.

02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:12.900
So if Iran is saying that this is saying

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:18.300
that they want to wipe Israel off the face of the earth,

02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:20.820
that justifies any response.

02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:22.900
On the other side.

02:46:22.900 --> 02:46:23.940
On the other side.

02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:26.460
Of course, I tend to agree with you fully.

02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:29.500
And unfortunately, this is a very critical situation

02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:34.340
that this region is facing, Iran in particular.

02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:40.180
I would say that I hope that in the minds

02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:43.180
of the people of Israel,

02:46:44.020 --> 02:46:49.020
there is enough or common sense to realize

02:46:50.500 --> 02:46:54.340
that probably escalation on the Israeli side

02:46:54.340 --> 02:46:56.300
is not in the favor of anybody.

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:00.300
And try to let the Iranians to go on

02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:05.300
with their empty rhetoric as they do so far.

02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:11.180
But at the same time, I cannot deny the fact that

02:47:12.180 --> 02:47:16.420
you know, there is a danger on the side of this regime

02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:18.140
and what it says.

02:47:18.140 --> 02:47:19.180
It cannot be denied.

02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:20.740
Nobody can justify that.

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:25.020
Particularly because the Iranian population

02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:27.980
is not behind this regime.

02:47:27.980 --> 02:47:30.620
Certainly in the case of the Palestinians.

02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:33.220
Or for that matter, it's not Palestine.

02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:38.220
It's the Islamic Republic's involvement in Lebanon

02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:40.540
with Hezbollah.

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:43.820
It's the Islamic Republic's involvement in Syria

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.900
with Bashar Assad.

02:47:45.900 --> 02:47:48.540
It's involvement in other parts of the world,

02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:49.900
perhaps even Yemen.

02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:55.900
That all of them creates extra territorial responsibilities

02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:02.260
or interventions, unnecessary interventions

02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:08.180
that ultimately is not in favor of best interests

02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:11.620
of the Iranian people or Iran as a country.

02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:14.900
Iran has never been involved in this kind of politics

02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:17.700
before of the Islamic Republic.

02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:22.140
So in a sense, the Iranian regime, it seems to me,

02:48:22.140 --> 02:48:26.020
by going to the extreme, try to create for itself

02:48:27.020 --> 02:48:32.020
a space that it did not have or did not deserve to have

02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:37.380
within the politics of the region.

02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:43.220
So in other words, that has become part of the tool,

02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:47.300
a kind of an instrument for, if you like to call it,

02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:51.460
some kind of an expansionism of the regime.

02:48:52.500 --> 02:48:55.980
In parts of the world where it can see

02:48:55.980 --> 02:49:00.980
there is a possibility for its presence, for its expansion.

02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:05.540
Of course, historically speaking,

02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:08.980
Iran ever since 15th century,

02:49:08.980 --> 02:49:11.300
I think that's the earliest example I can see,

02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:16.220
in early modern times has always a tendency

02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:20.420
of moving in the direction of not only what is today

02:49:20.420 --> 02:49:25.140
the state of Iraq, but further into the eastern coast

02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:26.580
of Mediterranean.

02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:31.580
So that's a long-term ambition that has been in the cards

02:49:32.020 --> 02:49:37.020
as far as Iran as a strategic unit is concerned.

02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:40.860
But by no means justified and by no means

02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:44.860
could be a reasonable, could be a sane policy

02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:49.860
of a nation state as today's Iran.

02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:53.940
But the second point is that also

02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:59.540
regimes are always victims of their own rhetoric.

02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:05.540
So it's, once you keep repeating something,

02:50:07.020 --> 02:50:10.220
then you become more and more committed to it.

02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:13.780
And it cannot remain anymore in the level of a rhetoric.

02:50:13.780 --> 02:50:15.900
You have to do something about it.

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:20.900
So it's a compelling pressure to try to materialize

02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:26.940
what you've been saying in your rhetoric.

02:50:26.980 --> 02:50:29.780
And that is even extremely more dangerous

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:33.740
as far as Iran is concerned.

02:50:33.740 --> 02:50:38.740
And it brings it to some unholy alliances

02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:43.700
that today we are witnessing Iran is getting involved.

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:47.220
Even more dangerous than this rhetoric

02:50:49.300 --> 02:50:52.260
in terms of the vis-a-vis Israel

02:50:52.260 --> 02:50:54.900
is its involvement with Russia

02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:56.500
and to some extent with China.

02:50:57.620 --> 02:50:58.780
Which we can talk about.

02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:00.820
What do you think about the meeting

02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:03.700
between Harmony and Vladimir Putin in July?

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:06.540
What's that alliance?

02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:08.540
What's that partnership?

02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:10.660
Is it surface level geopolitics

02:51:10.660 --> 02:51:12.900
or is there a deep growing connection?

02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:17.220
I cannot see the difference between geopolitics

02:51:17.220 --> 02:51:18.700
and these deep connections.

02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:21.020
I see it's one and the same.

02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:22.420
Why?

02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:27.060
Because I think the experience of 40 years

02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.780
of distancing from the West

02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:33.380
in terms of the Islamic Republic.

02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:39.820
And the fact that there is a shelf life to imperial presence

02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:44.940
for any empire anywhere in the world.

02:51:46.300 --> 02:51:51.300
So after the terrible experience of the United States

02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:57.180
in Iraq and in Afghanistan,

02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:02.580
pretty much like the British Empire

02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:05.980
that after the Suez experience in 56

02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:10.980
decided to withdraw from East of Suez.

02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:16.420
Maybe there is a moment here that we are witnessing

02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:19.820
or it may come that a great power

02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:22.940
like the United States sees in its benefit

02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:26.500
not to get too much involved into nitty gritty things

02:52:26.500 --> 02:52:28.340
in other parts of the world

02:52:28.340 --> 02:52:30.780
that it's not its immediate concern.

02:52:32.300 --> 02:52:36.540
And I think that is part of the reason,

02:52:36.540 --> 02:52:38.220
not the entire reason.

02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:41.020
Part of the reason why we see the emergence

02:52:41.020 --> 02:52:46.020
of a new geopolitical environment

02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:49.580
in this part of the world

02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:55.220
of which China, Russia, possibly Iran, possibly Turkey,

02:52:57.260 --> 02:53:00.300
possibly both of them are going to be part.

02:53:01.580 --> 02:53:03.540
Perhaps Saudis also,

02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:08.540
but I doubt that the Saudis under the present circumstances,

02:53:08.740 --> 02:53:12.580
although we have witnessed some remarkable issue

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:15.420
in the course of the past few weeks

02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:18.100
where the Saudis giving assurances

02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:21.780
to American administration and then shifting

02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:24.860
and getting along with Putin

02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:26.780
in terms of the oil production,

02:53:26.780 --> 02:53:28.500
I think it's more than that even.

02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:30.140
And it's not only them,

02:53:30.140 --> 02:53:32.820
but also the Emirates are doing the same thing.

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:34.340
So what does that tell us?

02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:37.020
And that's another many hour conversation

02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:42.020
about the oil industry in Iran and the whole region.

02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:45.780
In emerging this kind of a world

02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:50.460
which was perhaps even 10 years ago unimaginable

02:53:50.460 --> 02:53:54.540
that you see now a great power, China,

02:53:54.540 --> 02:53:59.540
that it's going to remain from what we see around us

02:53:59.540 --> 02:54:04.540
as a great power and Russia, adventurous, foolish,

02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:12.020
but nevertheless would remain criminal,

02:54:12.020 --> 02:54:17.020
I would say as far as its behavior in Ukraine,

02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:20.460
but actually it's a rogue nation

02:54:20.460 --> 02:54:23.100
that attracts another rogue nation.

02:54:23.100 --> 02:54:28.100
So Iran finds itself now in a greater place of security

02:54:30.180 --> 02:54:33.660
in alliance with Russia in the hope

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:37.420
that this would give Iran a greater security

02:54:37.420 --> 02:54:39.780
in this part of the world.

02:54:39.780 --> 02:54:44.780
Whether this is realistic or illusion,

02:54:46.820 --> 02:54:48.460
I think remains to be seen.

02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:51.820
I think Iran-China relation makes more sense.

02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:58.940
Although if you ask ordinary Iranians, they don't like it.

02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:03.940
They would tell why should we be tied up with China

02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:09.940
as the only trade party with America

02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:13.860
because of the foolish isolations

02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:15.700
that you have created for us

02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:18.820
because of all the sanctions that you have created for us,

02:55:18.820 --> 02:55:20.020
the Islamic Republic.

02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:24.940
So in a sense, it's a very difficult question to answer.

02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:28.580
Probably Iranians also like to be more on the other camp,

02:55:28.580 --> 02:55:32.580
but what happens is that in real term,

02:55:32.580 --> 02:55:37.580
what surprises me most is not this alliance with China,

02:55:38.540 --> 02:55:43.540
but it's kind of becoming a lackey or subservient

02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:49.660
to Putin's regime in Russia.

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:55.980
Since if you look at it, Iran ever since

02:55:56.020 --> 02:56:00.020
at least the 19th century, not going further back,

02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:02.340
the beginning of the 19th century

02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:07.340
always viewed Russia as the greatest threat strategically

02:56:07.940 --> 02:56:10.500
because it was sitting right at the top of Iran.

02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:17.900
It was infinitely more powerful than Iran has ever been.

02:56:20.620 --> 02:56:23.460
And Iran fought two rounds of war

02:56:23.460 --> 02:56:25.660
at the beginning of the century,

02:56:25.660 --> 02:56:29.900
lost the entire Caucasus to Russia

02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:35.740
and learned its lesson that you have to be mindful of Russia

02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:41.420
and you have to keep it as an arm's length.

02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:43.820
And that's what was the Iran's policies

02:56:43.820 --> 02:56:47.340
throughout the course of the 20th century,

02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:52.340
19th and 20th century up to what we see now around us,

02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:55.540
which is a very strange situation.

02:56:56.540 --> 02:57:01.540
Whether the balance has changed in terms of

02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:10.540
if Russia is purchasing weapons from Iran,

02:57:10.540 --> 02:57:12.300
which was unheard of,

02:57:13.180 --> 02:57:18.180
it means that there is a new balance is emerging,

02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:20.460
a new relationship is emerging.

02:57:21.740 --> 02:57:24.060
Perhaps remains to be seen,

02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:29.060
but if you look at the historical precedence,

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:33.700
it would have been enormously unwise

02:57:33.700 --> 02:57:38.140
to be an ally of Russia

02:57:38.140 --> 02:57:41.420
given its long history of aggression in Iran.

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:46.420
See, part of the reason why it's actually Iran

02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:51.180
allied itself with British Empire

02:57:51.180 --> 02:57:53.100
was the fact that it was so much afraid

02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:55.220
of the Russian expansion.

02:57:56.500 --> 02:58:00.700
And as such, I don't know what's going to be the future

02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:02.460
of this relationship.

02:58:02.460 --> 02:58:07.260
There is a big disconnect between governments

02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:08.340
and the people.

02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:12.300
And I think ultimately I have faith that there's a love

02:58:12.300 --> 02:58:14.220
across the different cultures,

02:58:14.220 --> 02:58:18.460
across the different religions amongst the people.

02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:20.540
And the governments are the source of the division

02:58:20.540 --> 02:58:23.700
and the conflict and the wars and all the geopolitics

02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:27.100
that is in part grounded in the battle for resources

02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:28.740
and all that kind of stuff.

02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:31.260
Nevertheless, this is the world we live in.

02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:34.420
So you looked at the modern history of Iran

02:58:34.420 --> 02:58:36.380
the past few centuries.

02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:39.460
If you look into the future of this region,

02:58:39.460 --> 02:58:42.860
now you kind of implied that historian

02:58:42.860 --> 02:58:45.260
has a bit of a cynical view

02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:50.100
of protests and things like this

02:58:51.660 --> 02:58:54.460
that are fueled at least in the minds

02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:56.220
of young people with hope.

02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:59.180
If you were to just for a while

02:58:59.180 --> 02:59:01.740
have a bit of hope in your heart and your mind,

02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:05.020
what is a hopeful future for the next 10, 20, 30 years

02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:05.860
of Iran?

02:59:05.860 --> 02:59:07.140
I'm not cynical.

02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:07.980
Yes.

02:59:07.980 --> 02:59:10.220
I'm trying to be realistic.

02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:14.420
And I actually may be critical, but I have great hopes.

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:19.940
In Iran's future for a variety of reasons.

02:59:19.940 --> 02:59:22.420
I actually did write an article

02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:25.980
only if the last version of it is going to go out today

02:59:27.580 --> 02:59:31.980
in which the title of it is the Time of Fear

02:59:31.980 --> 02:59:36.980
and Women of Hope, which in a sense is this whole coverage

02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:42.060
about what this movement means that we see today.

02:59:42.900 --> 02:59:46.660
It may fizzle in a few weeks time,

02:59:46.660 --> 02:59:51.300
or it may just go on and create new dynamics

02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:56.300
in Iranian society that would hopefully result

02:59:56.940 --> 03:00:01.940
in a peaceful process of greater accommodation

03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:07.980
and the greater tolerance within the Iranian society

03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:10.060
and with the outside world.

03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:14.140
And I think majority of the Iranian people

03:00:14.140 --> 03:00:18.620
don't want tension, don't want confrontation,

03:00:19.820 --> 03:00:22.260
don't want crisis.

03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:27.780
They, if 40 years they have suffered

03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:32.380
from a regime that have dictated an ideology

03:00:32.380 --> 03:00:37.380
that is regressive and impractical,

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:42.660
they want to go back to a life in which they don't,

03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:45.380
they don't really create trouble

03:00:45.380 --> 03:00:47.500
for their neighbors or for the world.

03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:53.380
And therefore I would see a better future for Iran.

03:00:53.380 --> 03:00:58.380
That's for one reason, strategically or geopolitically

03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:04.820
may be in Iran's advantage in a peaceful fashion

03:01:05.180 --> 03:01:09.700
to negotiate as it's the fate of all the nations

03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:14.140
rather than commit itself or sworn

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:19.140
to a particular course of policy.

03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:22.700
So there's a give and take as the nature

03:01:22.700 --> 03:01:26.780
of politics is art of possible, as it's been said.

03:01:26.780 --> 03:01:30.180
So probably Iran is going to be hopefully

03:01:30.180 --> 03:01:32.100
moving in that direction.

03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:34.540
I think there is a generational thing

03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:35.940
that's the third reason.

03:01:37.100 --> 03:01:42.100
No matter how much the Islamic Republic tried

03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:48.460
to Islamicize the Iranian society in its own image

03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:53.820
of kind of radical ideological indoctrination,

03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:56.140
it has failed.

03:01:57.460 --> 03:02:01.580
It has failed up to what we see today

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:03.180
in the Iranian streets.

03:02:04.140 --> 03:02:06.900
And the Iranian population said no to it.

03:02:08.220 --> 03:02:11.180
And I think if there would have been

03:02:11.180 --> 03:02:14.700
and I very much hope there will be a possibility

03:02:14.700 --> 03:02:19.660
for a more open environment, more open space

03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:23.420
where they would be able to speak their views out.

03:02:24.700 --> 03:02:28.020
Iranians are not on the side of moving

03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:31.260
in the extreme directions.

03:02:31.260 --> 03:02:35.260
They are in the side of greater accommodation

03:02:35.260 --> 03:02:38.180
and the greater interest in the outside world.

03:02:39.220 --> 03:02:43.420
And if you look at every aspect of today's

03:02:43.420 --> 03:02:46.700
beside the government, every aspect of life

03:02:46.700 --> 03:02:50.180
in today's Iran, we can see that from the way

03:02:50.180 --> 03:02:54.340
that people dress to the way that they try

03:02:54.340 --> 03:02:58.380
to live their lives, to the way that they're educating

03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:02.260
themselves or being educated in the institutions.

03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:06.860
Do you see a desire, an intention to move forward?

03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:08.420
And I'm optimistic.

03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:12.420
Well, in that struggle for freedom,

03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:16.220
like I told you offline, one of my close childhood friends

03:03:16.220 --> 03:03:17.580
is Iranian.

03:03:17.580 --> 03:03:21.300
Just a beautiful person, his family is a wonderful family.

03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:26.020
On a personal level is one of the deeper windows

03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:28.100
into the Iranian spirit and soul

03:03:28.100 --> 03:03:29.500
that I've gotten a chance to witness.

03:03:29.500 --> 03:03:31.100
So I really appreciate it.

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:33.820
But in the recent times, I've gotten to hear

03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:36.580
from a lot of people that are currently living in Iran,

03:03:36.580 --> 03:03:39.660
that are currently have that burning hope

03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:40.940
for the future of the country.

03:03:40.940 --> 03:03:43.700
And so my love goes out to them

03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:44.860
in the struggle for freedom.

03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:45.700
I have to-

03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:47.940
That's so nice of you to say so.

03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:49.300
And I very much hope so.

03:03:50.540 --> 03:03:54.100
There are moments of despair and there are moments

03:03:54.620 --> 03:03:57.860
that you would think that there is no hope.

03:03:57.860 --> 03:04:02.860
And, but then again, something triggers

03:04:04.340 --> 03:04:06.980
and you see a hundred thousand people

03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:09.540
in the streets of Berlin

03:04:10.660 --> 03:04:14.500
that are hoping for a better future for Iran.

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:17.140
And I very much hope it eventually emerges.

03:04:17.140 --> 03:04:19.100
Even I'm hoping at the same time,

03:04:19.100 --> 03:04:22.620
there's not going to be a very strong leadership

03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:24.820
as it was the case in the past.

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:26.260
We started with hope.

03:04:26.260 --> 03:04:27.940
We ended with hope.

03:04:27.940 --> 03:04:29.540
This was a real honor.

03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:30.940
This is an incredible conversation.

03:04:30.940 --> 03:04:35.940
Thank you for giving such a deep

03:04:36.100 --> 03:04:40.340
and wide story of this great nation.

03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:42.020
One of the great nations in history.

03:04:42.020 --> 03:04:44.060
Well, that's very kind of you to say so.

03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:45.580
And thank you for sitting down today.

03:04:45.580 --> 03:04:46.420
This was amazing.

03:04:46.420 --> 03:04:48.660
Well, a history that's,

03:04:48.660 --> 03:04:51.380
as I've said in the start of my book,

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:53.300
I say it's the history of a nation

03:04:53.300 --> 03:04:57.620
which has learned a huge amount from the outside world

03:04:57.620 --> 03:05:00.260
by force of its geography.

03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:04.140
It was always located somewhere that people would invade

03:05:04.140 --> 03:05:07.900
or come for trade or something happened to it

03:05:07.900 --> 03:05:12.180
that this diffused culture continued to,

03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:15.620
and they were not afraid of learning or adopting

03:05:15.620 --> 03:05:17.540
as they do right now today.

03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:21.220
This is a very different society.

03:05:22.060 --> 03:05:25.580
Never a boring moment in its history as you write about.

03:05:25.580 --> 03:05:26.420
Thank you so much.

03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:27.260
This was awesome.

03:05:27.260 --> 03:05:28.300
Thank you.

03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:31.340
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Abba Samana.

03:05:31.340 --> 03:05:32.540

03:05:35.260 --> 03:05:38.060
And now let me leave you with a few words

03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:41.020
from Martin Luther King Jr.

03:05:41.020 --> 03:05:44.220
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.

03:05:45.220 --> 03:05:46.460
Thank you for listening.

03:05:46.460 --> 03:05:48.380
I hope to see you next time.

03:05:51.220 --> 03:05:52.060
Thank you.
