00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
The following is a conversation with Jeff Bezos,

00:03.160 --> 00:06.280
founder of Amazon and Blue Origin.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.840
This is his first time doing a conversation of this kind

00:09.840 --> 00:11.280
and of this length.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.160
And as he told me, it felt like we could have easily talked

00:14.160 --> 00:17.720
for many more hours, and I'm sure we will.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.760
This is the Lex Freeman podcast.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.560
And now, dear friends, here's Jeff Bezos.

00:24.560 --> 00:27.720
You spent a lot of your childhood with your grandfather

00:27.800 --> 00:30.240
on a ranch here in Texas.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.020
And I heard you had a lot of work to do around the ranch.

00:33.020 --> 00:35.320
So what's the coolest job you remember doing there?

00:35.320 --> 00:37.160
Wow, coolest.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.360
Most interesting.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.200
Most memorable.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.040
Most memorable.

00:40.040 --> 00:40.880
Most impactful.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.340
I mean, it's a real working ranch.

00:44.840 --> 00:49.320
And I spent all my summers on that ranch from age four to 16.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.720
And my grandfather was really taking me those

00:51.720 --> 00:54.360
in the summers, and in the early summers,

00:54.360 --> 00:57.480
he was letting me pretend to help on the ranch.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.280
Because of course, a four-year-old is a burden,

00:59.280 --> 01:01.160
not a help in real life.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.880
He was really just watching me and taking care of me.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.000
He was doing that because my mom was so young.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.920
She had me when she was 17.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.520
And so he was sort of giving her a break,

01:11.520 --> 01:13.760
and my grandmother and my grandfather would take me

01:13.760 --> 01:15.040
for these summers.

01:15.040 --> 01:15.880
But as I got a little older,

01:15.880 --> 01:18.840
I actually was helpful on the ranch, and I loved it.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.520
I was out there, like my grandfather had a huge influence

01:22.520 --> 01:25.520
on me, huge factor in my life.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.840
And I did all the jobs you would do on a ranch.

01:27.840 --> 01:32.840
I've fixed windmills and laid fences and pipelines,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.960
and done all the things that any rancher would do,

01:37.960 --> 01:40.040
vaccinated the animals, everything.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.200
But we had a, my grandfather, after my grandmother died,

01:46.200 --> 01:48.640
I was about 12, and I kept coming to the ranch.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.040
Then it was just him and me, just the two of us.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.880
And he was completely addicted to the soap opera,

01:55.880 --> 01:57.800
the days of our lives.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.440
And we would go back to the ranch house every day

02:00.440 --> 02:04.360
around 1 p.m. or so to watch days of our lives.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.080
Like sands through an hourglass,

02:06.080 --> 02:07.760
so are the days of our lives.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.960
Just the image of that, the two of us sitting there,

02:10.960 --> 02:12.200
watching a soap opera.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.360
He had these big, crazy dogs.

02:14.360 --> 02:16.560
It was really a very formative experience for me.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.320
But the key thing about it, for me,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.840
the great gift I got from it,

02:21.840 --> 02:25.240
was that my grandfather was so resourceful.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.960
He did everything himself.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.480
He made his own veterinary tools.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.280
He would make needles to suture the cattle up with.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.120
He would find a little piece of wire and heat it up

02:34.120 --> 02:37.200
and pound it thin and drill a hole in it and sharpen it.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.840
So you learn different things on a ranch

02:40.840 --> 02:43.360
than you would learn growing up in a city.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.560
So self-reliance.

02:44.560 --> 02:47.640
Yeah, like figuring out that you can solve problems

02:47.640 --> 02:52.080
with enough persistence and ingenuity.

02:52.080 --> 02:55.080
My grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer,

02:55.080 --> 02:56.720
which is a big bulldozer.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.520
And he got it for like $5,000

02:58.520 --> 03:00.240
because it was completely broken down.

03:00.240 --> 03:04.680
It was like a 1955 Caterpillar D6 bulldozer.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.000
Knew it would have cost, I don't know,

03:06.000 --> 03:07.960
more than $100,000.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.920
And we spent an entire summer fixing,

03:10.920 --> 03:13.120
like repairing that bulldozer.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.920
We'd use mail order to buy big gears

03:16.920 --> 03:17.920
for the transmission.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.760
And they'd show up, they'd be too heavy to move.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.920
So we'd have to build a crane.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.560
Just that kind of problem-solving mentality.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.200
He had it so powerfully.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.600
He did all of his own.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.440
He didn't pick up the phone and call somebody.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.360
He would figure it out on his own.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.400
Doing his own veterinary work.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.680
But just the image of the two of you fixing a D6 bulldozer

03:42.680 --> 03:45.680
and then going in for a little break at 1 p.m.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.480
to watch Soap Opera.

03:47.480 --> 03:48.600
Laying on the floor.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.440
That's how he watched TV.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.600
He was a really, really remarkable guy.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.640
That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.560
In all those Westerns.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.520
When he's not doing what he's doing,

03:59.520 --> 04:01.440
he's just watching soap operas.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.040
All right, I read that you fell in love

04:04.040 --> 04:06.120
with the idea of space and space exploration

04:06.120 --> 04:07.840
when you were five.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.880
Watching Neil Armstrong walking on the moon.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.360
So let me ask you to look back

04:13.360 --> 04:16.160
at the historical context and impact of that.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.920
So the space race from 1957 to 1969

04:20.920 --> 04:23.520
between the Soviet Union and the U.S.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.520
was in many ways epic.

04:25.520 --> 04:29.200
It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.440
First satellite to space.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.000
First human to space.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.040
First space walk.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.560
First uncrewed landing on the moon.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.360
Then some failures, explosions.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.440
Deaths on both sides, actually.

04:40.440 --> 04:44.000
And then the first human walking on the moon.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.840
What are some of the more inspiring moments

04:45.840 --> 04:47.600
or insights you take away from that time?

04:47.600 --> 04:51.120
Those few years, just 12 years.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.600
Well, I mean, there's so much inspiring there.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.960
One of the great things to take away from that,

04:56.960 --> 04:59.440
one of the great von Braun quotes is,

04:59.440 --> 05:04.440
I have come to use the word impossible with great caution.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.440
And so that's kind of the big story of Apollo

05:10.440 --> 05:15.440
is that things, going to the moon was literally

05:15.480 --> 05:17.200
an analogy that people used

05:17.200 --> 05:19.320
for something that's impossible.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.320
Oh yeah, you'll do that when men walk on the moon.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.160
And of course it finally happened.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.280
So I think it was pulled forward in time

05:29.280 --> 05:31.600
because of the space race.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.840
I think with the geopolitical implications

05:35.280 --> 05:37.760
and how much resource was put into it.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.880
At the peak, that program was spending

05:39.880 --> 05:44.120
two or 3% of GDP on the Apollo program.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.440
So much resource, I think it was pulled forward in time.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.680
We kind of did it ahead of when we quote unquote

05:51.680 --> 05:53.280
should have done it.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.920
And so in that way, it's also a technical marvel.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.000
I mean, it's truly incredible.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.200
It's the 20th century version

06:02.200 --> 06:04.640
of building the pyramids or something.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.440
It's an achievement that,

06:07.440 --> 06:09.120
because it was pulled forward in time

06:09.120 --> 06:10.320
and because it did something

06:10.320 --> 06:12.560
that had previously been thought impossible,

06:12.560 --> 06:14.400
it rightly deserves its place

06:14.400 --> 06:17.760
as in the pantheon of great human achievements.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.240
And of course you named the projects, the rockets

06:21.240 --> 06:22.560
that Blue Origin is working on

06:22.560 --> 06:24.120
after some of the folks involved.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.640
I don't understand why I didn't say new Gagarin.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.480
Is that-

06:27.480 --> 06:29.040
There's an American bias in the naming.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.120
I apologize.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.240
It's very strange.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.080
Lex.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.320
Just asking for a friend.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.160
Clarify.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.040
I'm a big fan of Gagarin's though.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.640
In fact, I think his first words in space

06:41.760 --> 06:43.360
I think are incredible.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.680
He purportedly said, my God, it's blue.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.680
And that really drives home.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.360
No one had seen the earth from space.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.600
No one knew that we were on this blue planet.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.080
No one knew what it looked like from out there.

06:58.080 --> 07:01.080
And Gagarin was the first person to see it.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
One of the things I think about

07:02.080 --> 07:05.560
is how dangerous those early days were

07:05.560 --> 07:08.720
for Gagarin, for Glenn, for everybody involved.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.480
Like how big of a risk they were all taking.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.400
They were taking huge risks.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.560
I'm not sure what the Soviets thought

07:14.560 --> 07:16.120
about Gagarin's flight,

07:16.120 --> 07:18.360
but I think that the Americans thought

07:18.360 --> 07:20.000
that the Alan Shepard flight,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.440
the flight that New Shepard is named after

07:22.440 --> 07:23.840
or the first American in space,

07:23.840 --> 07:26.360
he'd been on his suborbital flight,

07:26.360 --> 07:30.520
they thought he had about a 75% chance of success.

07:31.360 --> 07:36.040
So, you know, that's a pretty big risk, a 25% risk.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.800
It's kind of interesting that Alan Shepard

07:37.800 --> 07:39.960
is not quite as famous as John Glenn.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.920
So for people who don't know,

07:40.920 --> 07:44.720
Alan Shepard is the first astronaut.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.440
The first American in space.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.400
American in suborbital flight.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.240
Correct.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.360
And then the first orbital flight is.

07:51.360 --> 07:54.840
John Glenn is the first American to orbit the earth.

07:54.840 --> 07:58.000
By the way, I have the most charming, sweet,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.960
incredible letter from John Glenn,

08:01.840 --> 08:04.400
which I have framed and hang on my office wall,

08:04.400 --> 08:07.840
where he tells me how grateful he is

08:07.840 --> 08:10.640
that we have named New Glenn after him.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.640
And he sent me that letter about a week before he died.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.840
And it's really incredible.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.480
It's also a very funny letter.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.320
He's writing and he says, you know,

08:20.320 --> 08:24.120
this is a letter about New Glenn from the original Glenn.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.160
And he's got a great sense of humor

08:26.160 --> 08:29.240
and he's very happy about it and grateful.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.280
It's very sweet.

08:30.280 --> 08:32.560
Does he say, P.S. don't mess this up or is it?

08:32.560 --> 08:35.080
No, he doesn't.

08:35.080 --> 08:35.920
Make me look good.

08:35.920 --> 08:36.760
He doesn't do that.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.600
Okay.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.720
But John, wherever you are, we got you covered.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.560
Good.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.360
So back to maybe the big picture of space.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.920
When you look up at the stars and think big,

08:47.920 --> 08:49.840
what do you hope is the future of humanity?

08:49.840 --> 08:53.320
Hundreds, thousands of years from now out in space.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.520
I would love to see, you know,

08:57.520 --> 09:01.600
a trillion humans living in the solar system.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.360
If we had a trillion humans, we would have,

09:04.360 --> 09:07.040
at any given time, a thousand Mozarts and a thousand

09:07.040 --> 09:09.840
Einsteins that would, you know,

09:09.840 --> 09:11.720
our solar system would be full of life

09:11.720 --> 09:13.760
and intelligence and energy.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.520
And we can easily support a civilization that large

09:17.520 --> 09:21.160
with all of the resources in the solar system.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.320
So what do you think that looks like?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.560
Giant space stations?

09:24.560 --> 09:26.640
Yeah, the only way to get to that vision is

09:26.640 --> 09:28.000
with giant space stations.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.080
You know, the planetary surfaces are just way too small.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.920
So you can, I mean, unless you turn them

09:33.920 --> 09:36.520
into giant space stations or something.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.400
But yeah, we will take materials from the moon

09:39.400 --> 09:43.560
and from near earth objects and from the asteroid belt

09:43.560 --> 09:48.560
and so on, and we'll build giant O'Neill style colonies.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.920
And people will live in those.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.120
And they have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.680
You can spin them to get normal earth gravity.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.360
You can put them where you want them.

09:59.360 --> 10:03.120
I think most people are gonna wanna live near earth,

10:03.120 --> 10:07.240
not necessarily in earth orbit, but in, you know,

10:07.240 --> 10:11.160
earth, but near earth vicinity orbits.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.560
And so they can move, you know, relatively quickly

10:15.560 --> 10:19.200
back and forth between their station and earth.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.160
So I think a lot of people, especially in the early stages,

10:22.200 --> 10:24.800
are not gonna wanna give up earth altogether.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.640
They go to earth for vacation.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.680
Yeah, same way that, you know, you might go to

10:29.680 --> 10:31.600
Yellowstone National Park for vacation.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.000
People will, and people will get to choose

10:35.000 --> 10:37.720
where they live on earth or where they live in space,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.520
but they'll be able to use much more energy

10:40.520 --> 10:43.200
and much more material resource in space

10:43.200 --> 10:45.440
than they would be able to use on earth.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.480
One interesting idea is you had is to move

10:47.480 --> 10:49.720
the heavy industry away from earth.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.400
So people sometimes have this idea

10:51.400 --> 10:55.800
that somehow space exploration is in conflict

10:55.800 --> 10:58.560
with the celebration of the planet earth,

10:58.560 --> 11:00.600
that we should focus on preserving earth.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.200
And basically your idea is that space travel

11:04.200 --> 11:06.760
and space exploration is a way to preserve earth.

11:06.760 --> 11:07.880
Exactly.

11:07.880 --> 11:12.880
This planet, we've sent robotic probes to all the planets.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.000
We know that this is the good one.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.160
Yeah, not to play favorites or anything, but.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.760
Earth really is the good planet.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.560
It's amazing.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.120
The ecosystem we have here, all of the life

11:25.120 --> 11:29.880
and the lush plant life and the water resources,

11:29.880 --> 11:33.200
everything, this planet is really extraordinary.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.000
And of course we evolved on this planet.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.320
So of course it's perfect for us,

11:37.320 --> 11:39.840
but it's also perfect for all the advanced life forms

11:39.840 --> 11:42.240
on this planet, all the animals and so on.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.080
And so this is a gym.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.000
We do need to take care of it.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.200
And as we enter the Anthropocene,

11:48.720 --> 11:52.520
as we humans have gotten so sophisticated

11:52.520 --> 11:57.520
and large and impactful, as we stride across this planet,

12:00.960 --> 12:03.440
as we continue, we want to use a lot of energy.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.280
We want to use a lot of energy per capita.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.240
We've gotten amazing things.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.680
We don't wanna go backwards.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
If you think about the good old days,

12:15.560 --> 12:17.320
they're mostly an illusion.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.000
Like in almost every way, life is better

12:20.000 --> 12:23.320
for almost everyone today than it was, say,

12:23.320 --> 12:25.200
50 years ago or 100 years ago.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.680
We live better lives by and large

12:27.680 --> 12:29.480
than our grandparents did

12:29.480 --> 12:31.680
and then their grandparents did and so on.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.360
And you can see that in global illiteracy rates,

12:34.360 --> 12:38.040
global poverty rates, global infant mortality rates.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.000
Like almost any metric you choose,

12:41.000 --> 12:42.520
we're better off than we used to be.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.640
And we get antibiotics

12:44.640 --> 12:47.280
and all kinds of lifesaving medical care.

12:47.280 --> 12:49.080
And so on and so on.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.040
And there's one thing that is moving backwards

12:53.040 --> 12:54.600
and it's the natural world.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.600
So it is a fact that 500 years ago, pre-industrial age,

12:59.720 --> 13:01.400
the natural world was pristine.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.640
It was incredible.

13:03.640 --> 13:08.640
And we have traded some of that pristine beauty

13:08.920 --> 13:10.720
for all of these other gifts

13:10.720 --> 13:13.680
that we have as an advanced society.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.080
And we can have both, but to do that,

13:17.080 --> 13:18.880
we have to go to space.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.920
And all of this really, the most fundamental measure

13:22.920 --> 13:25.640
is energy usage per capita.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.320
And when you look at,

13:27.320 --> 13:30.320
you do wanna continue to use more and more energy.

13:30.320 --> 13:33.560
It is going to make your life better in so many ways,

13:33.560 --> 13:36.360
but that's not compatible ultimately

13:36.360 --> 13:38.040
with living on a finite planet.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.960
And so we have to go out into the solar system.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.800
And really you could argue about when you have to do that,

13:44.800 --> 13:47.440
but you can't credibly argue

13:47.440 --> 13:49.600
about whether you have to do that.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.280
Eventually we have to do that.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.360
Exactly.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.040
So you don't often talk about it,

13:54.040 --> 13:57.440
but let me ask you on that topic about the Blue Ring

13:57.440 --> 14:01.400
and the Orbital Reef space infrastructure projects.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.440
What's your vision for these?

14:03.440 --> 14:07.120
So Blue Ring is a very interesting spacecraft

14:07.120 --> 14:12.120
that is designed to take up to 3000 kilograms of payload

14:12.720 --> 14:17.200
up to geosynchronous orbit or in lunar vicinity.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.200
It has two different kinds of propulsion.

14:20.200 --> 14:24.440
It has chemical propulsion and it has electric propulsion.

14:24.440 --> 14:29.040
And so you can use Blue Ring in a couple of different ways.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.760
You can slowly move, let's say up to geosynchronous orbit

14:32.760 --> 14:36.800
using electric propulsion that might take 100 days

14:36.800 --> 14:40.240
or 150 days, depending on how much mass you're carrying.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.920
And then reserve your chemical propulsion

14:42.920 --> 14:44.640
so that you can change orbits quickly

14:44.640 --> 14:46.760
in geosynchronous orbit.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.640
Or you can use the chemical propulsion first

14:49.640 --> 14:51.320
to quickly get up to geosynchronous

14:51.320 --> 14:52.840
and then use your electrical propulsion

14:52.840 --> 14:55.640
to slowly change your geosynchronous orbit.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.320
Blue Ring has a couple of interesting features.

14:59.320 --> 15:04.320
It provides a lot of services to these payloads.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.320
So it could be one large payload

15:07.320 --> 15:10.200
or it can be a number of small payloads.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.280
And it provides thermal management.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.280
It provides electric power.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.280
It provides compute, provides communications.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.320
And so when you design a payload for Blue Ring,

15:24.320 --> 15:28.320
you don't have to figure out all of those things

15:28.320 --> 15:29.160
on your own.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.080
So kind of radiation tolerant compute

15:32.080 --> 15:34.040
is a complicated thing to do.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.960
And so we have an unusually large amount

15:37.040 --> 15:39.120
of compute onboard Blue Ring.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.640
And your payload can just use that when it needs to.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.680
So it's sort of all these services.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.600
It's like a set of APIs.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.640
It's a little bit like Amazon Web Services,

15:51.640 --> 15:54.840
but for space payloads that need to move

15:54.840 --> 15:58.240
about an Earth vicinity or a lunar vicinity.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.740
A-W-S-S.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.760
Okay, so compute in space.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.840
So you get a giant chemical rocket

16:04.840 --> 16:06.960
to get a payload out to orbit.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.960
And then you have these admins that show up,

16:09.960 --> 16:13.280
this Blue Ring thing that manages various things

16:13.280 --> 16:14.100
like compute.

16:14.100 --> 16:14.940
Exactly.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.200
And it can also provide transportation

16:17.200 --> 16:19.000
and move you around to different orbits.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.480
Including humans, you think?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.320
No, but Blue Ring is not designed to move humans around.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.880
It's designed to move payloads around.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.200
So we're also building a lunar lander,

16:30.200 --> 16:33.600
which is of course designed to land humans

16:33.600 --> 16:34.720
on the surface of the moon.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.400
I'm gonna ask you about that,

16:36.400 --> 16:40.520
but let me actually just step back to the old days.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.600
You were at Princeton with aspirations

16:43.600 --> 16:45.400
to be a theoretical physicist.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.220
Yeah.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.320
What attracted you to physics

16:49.320 --> 16:52.920
and why did you change your mind and not become,

16:52.920 --> 16:54.760
why are you not, Jeff Bezos,

16:54.760 --> 16:57.040
the famous theoretical physicist?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.840
So I loved physics and I studied physics

16:59.840 --> 17:02.440
and computer science and I was proceeding

17:02.440 --> 17:05.120
along the physics path.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.440
I was planning to major in physics

17:06.440 --> 17:08.840
and I wanted to be a theoretical physicist.

17:08.840 --> 17:11.200
And the computer science was sort of something

17:11.200 --> 17:12.560
I was doing for fun.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.680
I really loved it.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.220
And I was very good at the programming

17:18.220 --> 17:19.060
and doing those things

17:19.060 --> 17:22.060
and I enjoyed all my computer science classes immensely.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.240
But I really was determined

17:24.240 --> 17:26.880
to be a theoretical physicist.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.100
That's why I went to Princeton in the first place.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.440
It was definitely.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.140
And then I realized I was gonna be

17:33.140 --> 17:35.520
a mediocre theoretical physicist.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.620
And there were a few people in my classes,

17:39.620 --> 17:41.280
like in quantum mechanics and so on,

17:41.280 --> 17:44.440
who they could effortlessly do

17:44.440 --> 17:46.400
things that were so difficult for me.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.720
And I realized, there are a thousand ways to be smart.

17:50.720 --> 17:53.800
And to be really, theoretical physics

17:53.800 --> 17:58.800
is not one of those fields where only the top few percent,

17:59.800 --> 18:02.640
actually move the state of the art forward.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.560
It's one of those things where you have to be really,

18:05.560 --> 18:09.080
just your brain has to be wired in a certain way.

18:09.080 --> 18:10.800
And there was a guy named,

18:10.800 --> 18:14.440
one of these people who was convinced me,

18:14.440 --> 18:15.760
he didn't mean to convince me,

18:15.760 --> 18:17.120
but just by observing him,

18:17.120 --> 18:18.920
he convinced me that I should not try

18:18.920 --> 18:20.720
to be a theoretical physicist.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.560
His name was Josanta.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.840
And Josanta was from Sri Lanka.

18:26.880 --> 18:30.600
And he was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.900
My friend Joe and I were working on a very difficult

18:34.900 --> 18:37.800
partial differential equations problem set one night.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.840
And there was one problem that we worked on for three hours

18:41.840 --> 18:45.520
and we made no headway whatsoever.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.280
And we looked up at each other at the same time

18:48.280 --> 18:49.640
and we said, Josanta.

18:49.640 --> 18:53.020
So we went to Josanta's dorm room and he was there.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.900
He was almost always there.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.540
And we said, Josanta, we're having trouble

18:57.540 --> 19:00.700
solving this partial differential equation.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.580
Would you mind taking a look?

19:02.580 --> 19:03.780
And he said, of course, by the way,

19:03.780 --> 19:07.620
he was the most humble, most kind person.

19:07.620 --> 19:10.420
And so he took our, he looked at our problem

19:10.420 --> 19:12.700
and he stared at it for just a few seconds,

19:12.700 --> 19:13.740
maybe 10 seconds.

19:13.740 --> 19:15.780
And he said, cosine.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.780
And I said, what do you mean, Josanta?

19:17.780 --> 19:18.620
What do you mean, cosine?

19:18.620 --> 19:19.780
He said, that's the answer.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.540
And I said, no, no, no, come on.

19:21.540 --> 19:22.500
And he said, let me show you.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.020
And he took out some paper

19:24.060 --> 19:27.660
and he wrote down three pages of equations.

19:27.660 --> 19:30.880
Everything canceled out and the answer was cosine.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.700
And I said, Josanta, did you do that in your head?

19:35.700 --> 19:38.120
And he said, oh no, that would be impossible.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.980
A few years ago, I solved a similar problem

19:40.980 --> 19:43.620
and I could map this problem onto that problem.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.140
And then it was immediately obvious

19:45.140 --> 19:47.300
that the answer was cosine.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.540
I had a few, you know, you have an experience like that.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.740
You realize maybe being a theoretical physicist,

19:52.740 --> 19:57.740
isn't what the universe wants you to be.

19:59.380 --> 20:02.180
And so I switched to computer science

20:02.180 --> 20:05.620
and you know, that worked out really well for me.

20:05.620 --> 20:07.420
I enjoy it, I still enjoy it today.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.300
Yeah, there's a particular kind of intuition

20:09.300 --> 20:12.700
you need to be a great physicist in applied to physics.

20:12.700 --> 20:17.380
I think the mathematical skill required today is so high.

20:17.380 --> 20:20.860
You have to be a world-class mathematician

20:20.860 --> 20:24.260
to be a successful theoretical physicist today.

20:24.260 --> 20:29.260
And it's not, you know, you probably need other skills too,

20:29.940 --> 20:32.640
intuition, lateral thinking, and so on.

20:32.640 --> 20:37.060
But without just top-notch math skills,

20:37.060 --> 20:39.260
you're unlikely to be successful.

20:39.260 --> 20:42.000
And visualization skill, you have to be able to

20:42.000 --> 20:44.340
really kind of do these kinds of thought experiments.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.900
And if you want truly great creativity,

20:46.900 --> 20:48.980
actually Walter Isaacson writes about you.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.940
Puts you on the same level as Einstein.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.740
That's very kind.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.580
I have, I'm an inventor.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.860
If you want to boil down what I am,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.500
I'm really an inventor.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.900
And I look at things and I can come up with

21:05.900 --> 21:09.180
atypical solutions and you know,

21:09.180 --> 21:12.420
and then I can create a hundred such atypical solutions

21:12.420 --> 21:16.300
for something, 99 of them may not survive,

21:16.500 --> 21:18.580
you know, scrutiny.

21:18.580 --> 21:21.980
But one of those 100 is like, hmm, maybe there is,

21:21.980 --> 21:23.500
maybe that might work.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.340
And then you can keep going from there.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.700
So that kind of lateral thinking,

21:27.700 --> 21:30.060
that kind of inventiveness.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.700
In a high dimensionality space

21:32.700 --> 21:34.820
where the search space is very large,

21:34.820 --> 21:37.460
that's where my inventive skills come.

21:37.460 --> 21:41.540
That's the thing I'm, if I self-identify as an inventor

21:41.540 --> 21:43.340
more than anything else.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.700
Yeah, and he describes in all kinds of different ways

21:45.700 --> 21:48.780
Walter Isaacson does that creativity

21:49.700 --> 21:52.460
combined with childlike wander

21:52.460 --> 21:55.820
that you've maintained still to this day.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.300
All of that combined together.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.620
Is there like, if you were to study your own brain,

21:59.620 --> 22:02.140
introspect, how do you think?

22:02.140 --> 22:03.660
What's your thinking process like?

22:03.660 --> 22:05.460
We'll talk about the writing process

22:05.460 --> 22:07.500
of putting it down on paper,

22:07.500 --> 22:12.500
which is quite rigorous and famous at Amazon.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.060
But how do you, when you sit down,

22:15.060 --> 22:16.740
maybe alone, maybe with others,

22:16.740 --> 22:19.620
and thinking through this high dimensional space

22:19.620 --> 22:22.420
and looking for creative solutions,

22:22.420 --> 22:24.100
creative paths forward,

22:24.100 --> 22:26.300
is there something you could say about that process?

22:26.300 --> 22:27.940
It's such a good question.

22:27.940 --> 22:30.980
And I honestly don't know how it works.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.180
If I did, I would try to explain it.

22:33.180 --> 22:35.940
I know it involves lots of wandering.

22:35.940 --> 22:40.260
So I, you know, when I sit down to work on a problem,

22:40.260 --> 22:43.660
I know I don't know where I'm going.

22:43.660 --> 22:47.300
So to go in a straight line, to be efficient,

22:47.300 --> 22:50.620
efficiency and invention are sort of at odds

22:50.620 --> 22:53.220
because invention, real invention,

22:53.220 --> 22:54.620
not incremental improvement.

22:54.620 --> 22:56.500
Incremental improvement is so important

22:56.500 --> 22:58.700
in every endeavor and everything you do.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.580
You have to work hard on also just making things

23:00.580 --> 23:02.300
a little bit better.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.660
But I'm talking about real invention,

23:04.660 --> 23:08.580
real lateral thinking that requires wandering.

23:08.580 --> 23:11.220
And you have to give yourself permission to wander.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.780
I think a lot of people,

23:15.300 --> 23:20.260
they feel like wandering is inefficient.

23:20.260 --> 23:25.260
And, you know, like when I sit down at a meeting,

23:26.260 --> 23:28.620
I don't know how long the meeting is gonna take

23:28.620 --> 23:30.380
if we're trying to solve a problem.

23:30.380 --> 23:33.940
Because if I did, then I'd already,

23:33.940 --> 23:35.940
I know there's some kind of straight line

23:35.940 --> 23:38.020
that we're drawing to the solution.

23:38.020 --> 23:42.260
The reality is we may have to wander for a long time.

23:42.260 --> 23:43.820
And I do like group invention.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.860
I think there's really nothing more fun

23:46.860 --> 23:51.420
than sitting at a whiteboard with a group of smart people

23:51.420 --> 23:55.580
and spit balling and coming up with new ideas

23:55.580 --> 23:57.380
and objections to those ideas

23:57.380 --> 23:59.300
and then solutions to the objections

23:59.300 --> 24:01.100
and going back and forth.

24:01.100 --> 24:05.500
So like, you know, sometimes you wake up with an idea

24:05.500 --> 24:07.700
in the middle of the night

24:08.540 --> 24:10.700
and sometimes you sit down with a group of people

24:10.700 --> 24:11.820
and go back and forth.

24:11.820 --> 24:14.900
And both things are really pleasurable.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.460
And when you wander, I think one key thing is

24:18.460 --> 24:21.940
to notice a good idea.

24:21.940 --> 24:25.940
And to maybe to notice the kernel of a good idea,

24:25.940 --> 24:27.980
maybe pull at that string.

24:27.980 --> 24:31.420
Because I don't think a good idea has come fully formed.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.700
A hundred percent right.

24:33.700 --> 24:37.500
In fact, when I come up with what I think is a good idea

24:38.300 --> 24:40.900
and it survives kind of the first level of scrutiny,

24:40.900 --> 24:42.540
you know, that I do in my own head

24:42.540 --> 24:45.860
and I'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea,

24:45.860 --> 24:48.580
I will often say, look, it is going to be really easy

24:48.580 --> 24:51.980
for you to find objections to this idea.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.180
But work with me.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.540
There's something there.

24:54.540 --> 24:55.660
There's something there.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.540
And that is intuition because it's really easy

24:59.540 --> 25:02.740
to kill new ideas in the beginning

25:02.740 --> 25:07.060
because they do have so many easy objections to them.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.420
So you need to kind of forewarn people and say, look,

25:10.420 --> 25:12.300
I know it's going to take a lot of work

25:12.300 --> 25:14.780
to get this to a fully formed idea.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.980
Let's get started on that.

25:15.980 --> 25:17.300
It'll be fun.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.940
So you got that ability to say cosign in you somewhere

25:19.940 --> 25:23.140
after all, maybe not on math.

25:23.140 --> 25:25.180
In a different domain.

25:25.180 --> 25:27.980
There are a thousand ways to be smart by the way.

25:27.980 --> 25:32.100
And that is a really like, when I go around, you know,

25:32.100 --> 25:34.300
and I meet people, I'm always looking for the way

25:34.340 --> 25:37.860
that they're smart and you find it is,

25:37.860 --> 25:40.380
that's one of the things that makes the world

25:40.380 --> 25:44.580
so interesting and fun is that it is not,

25:44.580 --> 25:48.780
it's not like IQ is a single dimension.

25:48.780 --> 25:52.940
There are people who are smart in such unique ways.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.460
Yeah, you just gave me a good response

25:54.460 --> 25:56.740
is when somebody calls me an idiot on the internet.

25:56.740 --> 26:01.140
You know, there's a thousand ways to be smart, sir.

26:01.140 --> 26:03.020
Well, they might tell you, yeah,

26:03.020 --> 26:04.820
but there are a million ways to be dumb.

26:04.820 --> 26:05.660
Yeah, right.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.900
I feel like that's a Mark Twain quote.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.540
Okay, all right.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.540
You gave me an amazing tour of Blue Origin rocket factory

26:13.540 --> 26:16.380
and launch complex and the historic Cape Canaveral.

26:17.380 --> 26:21.100
That's where New Glenn, the big rocket we talked about

26:21.100 --> 26:24.420
is being built and will launch.

26:24.420 --> 26:26.740
Can you explain what the New Glenn rocket is

26:26.740 --> 26:28.900
and tell me some interesting technical aspects

26:28.900 --> 26:29.740
of how it works?

26:29.740 --> 26:34.740
Sure, New Glenn is a very large heavy lift launch vehicle.

26:37.500 --> 26:42.500
It'll take about 45 metric tons to Leo, a very large class.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.860
It's about half the thrust,

26:46.860 --> 26:50.980
a little more than half the thrust of the Saturn V rocket.

26:50.980 --> 26:55.340
So it's about 3.9 million pounds of thrust on liftoff.

26:55.340 --> 26:59.380
The booster has seven BE-4 engines.

27:00.260 --> 27:01.900
Each engine generates a little more

27:01.900 --> 27:05.460
than 550,000 pounds of thrust.

27:05.460 --> 27:09.340
The engines are fueled by liquid natural gas,

27:09.340 --> 27:12.460
liquefied natural gas, LNG as the fuel

27:12.460 --> 27:15.280
and LOX as the oxidizer.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.260
The cycle is an Ox-rich stage combustion cycle.

27:19.260 --> 27:21.780
It's a cycle that was really pioneered by the Russians.

27:21.780 --> 27:23.260
It's a very good cycle.

27:24.260 --> 27:29.260
And that engine is also going to power the first stage

27:29.260 --> 27:30.260
of the Vulcan rocket,

27:30.260 --> 27:32.600
which is the United Launch Alliance rocket.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.700
Then the second stage of New Glenn

27:36.700 --> 27:39.300
is powered by two BE-3U engines,

27:39.300 --> 27:41.580
which is a upper stage variant

27:41.580 --> 27:43.980
of our New Shepard liquid hydrogen engine.

27:43.980 --> 27:48.260
So the BE-3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust.

27:48.260 --> 27:51.900
So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust.

27:52.420 --> 27:57.100
Hydrogen is a very good propellant for upper stages

27:57.100 --> 27:59.380
because it has very high ISP.

27:59.380 --> 28:03.860
It's not a great propellant in my view for booster stages

28:03.860 --> 28:06.820
because the stages then get physically so large.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.020
Hydrogen has very high ISP,

28:10.020 --> 28:14.740
but liquid hydrogen is not dense at all.

28:14.740 --> 28:17.220
So to store liquid hydrogen,

28:17.220 --> 28:19.000
if you need to store many thousands of pounds

28:19.000 --> 28:19.840
of liquid hydrogen,

28:20.360 --> 28:23.040
your liquid hydrogen tank, it's very large.

28:23.040 --> 28:27.360
So you get more benefit from the higher ISP,

28:27.360 --> 28:29.000
the specific impulse.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.600
You get more benefit from the higher specific impulse

28:31.600 --> 28:32.960
on the second stage.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.520
And that stage carries less propellant.

28:37.520 --> 28:41.000
So you don't get such geometrically gigantic tanks.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.920
The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle

28:43.920 --> 28:45.120
that is all hydrogen.

28:45.120 --> 28:47.680
The booster stage is also hydrogen.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.160
And I think that it's a very effective vehicle,

28:50.160 --> 28:52.400
but it never was very cost effective.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.400
So it's operationally very capable,

28:55.400 --> 28:56.720
but not very cost effective.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.480
So size is also costly.

28:58.480 --> 28:59.760
Size is costly.

28:59.760 --> 29:01.560
So it's interesting.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.480
Rockets love to be big.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.120
Everything works better.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.320
What do you mean by that?

29:06.320 --> 29:07.520
You've told me that before.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.000
It sounds epic, but what does it mean?

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
I mean, when you look at the physics of rocket engines,

29:15.880 --> 29:19.000
and also when you look at parasitic mass,

29:20.320 --> 29:22.240
let's say you have an avionics system.

29:22.240 --> 29:24.880
So you have a guidance and control system.

29:24.880 --> 29:29.360
That is gonna be about the same mass and size

29:29.360 --> 29:33.480
for a giant rocket as it is gonna be for a tiny rocket.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.600
And so that's just parasitic mass

29:36.600 --> 29:38.840
that is very consequential

29:38.840 --> 29:41.800
if you're building a very small rocket,

29:41.800 --> 29:44.160
but is trivial if you're building a very large rocket.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.480
So you have the parasitic mass thing.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.080
And then if you look at, for example,

29:48.080 --> 29:50.400
rocket engines have turbo pumps.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.760
They have to pressurize the fuel and the oxidizer

29:53.760 --> 29:55.800
up to a very high pressure level

29:55.800 --> 29:58.240
in order to inject it into the thrust chamber

29:58.240 --> 29:59.840
where it burns.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.920
And those pumps, all rotating machines in fact,

30:03.920 --> 30:06.680
get more efficient as they get larger.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.760
So really tiny turbo pumps

30:09.760 --> 30:13.120
are very challenging to manufacture

30:13.120 --> 30:18.120
and any kind of gaps are like between the housing,

30:18.720 --> 30:21.560
for example, and the rotating impeller

30:21.560 --> 30:22.920
that pressurizes the fuel.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.360
There has to be some gap there.

30:24.360 --> 30:27.480
You can't have those parts scraping against one another

30:27.480 --> 30:31.080
and those gaps drive inefficiencies.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.920
And so if you have a very large turbo pump,

30:34.920 --> 30:39.800
those gaps and percentage terms end up being very small.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.880
And so there's a bunch of things

30:41.880 --> 30:46.120
that you end up loving about having a large rocket

30:46.120 --> 30:48.480
and that you end up hating for a small rocket,

30:48.480 --> 30:51.440
but there's a giant exception to this rule

30:51.440 --> 30:53.280
and it is manufacturing.

30:53.280 --> 30:58.040
So manufacturing large structures is very, very challenging.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.440
It's a pain in the butt.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.360
And so it's just, if you're making a small rocket engine,

31:03.360 --> 31:04.840
you can move all the pieces by hand.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.640
You could assemble it on a table.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.040
One person can do it.

31:09.000 --> 31:12.280
You don't need cranes and heavy lift operations

31:12.280 --> 31:14.880
and tooling and so on and so on.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.600
When you start building big objects,

31:17.600 --> 31:20.480
infrastructure, civil infrastructure,

31:20.480 --> 31:23.160
just like the launch pad and all this,

31:23.160 --> 31:25.920
we went and visited and took you to the launch pad

31:25.920 --> 31:28.320
and you can see it's so monumental.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.960
And so just these things become major undertakings,

31:32.960 --> 31:35.120
both from an engineering point of view,

31:35.120 --> 31:37.800
but also from a construction and cost point of view.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.120
And even the foundation of the launch pad.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.080
I mean, this is Florida.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.320
Isn't it like Swamp Land?

31:43.320 --> 31:44.920
How deep do you have to go?

31:44.920 --> 31:48.720
At Cape Canaveral, in fact, at most ocean,

31:48.720 --> 31:52.440
most launch pads are on beaches somewhere on the ocean side

31:52.440 --> 31:55.860
because you want to launch over water for safety reasons.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.360
Yes, you have to drive pilings,

32:01.360 --> 32:04.120
dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings,

32:05.040 --> 32:07.840
50, 100, 150 feet deep

32:07.840 --> 32:10.640
to get enough structural integrity for these very large.

32:10.640 --> 32:13.760
You know, it's, yes, these turned into major

32:13.760 --> 32:15.400
civil engineering projects.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.560
I just have to say everything about that factory

32:17.560 --> 32:18.560
is pretty badass.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.720
You say tooling, the bigger it gets,

32:20.720 --> 32:22.560
the more epic it is.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.720
It does make it epic.

32:23.720 --> 32:24.840
It's fun to look at.

32:24.840 --> 32:25.960
It's extraordinary.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.240
It's humbling also,

32:27.240 --> 32:29.520
because humans are so small compared to it.

32:29.520 --> 32:33.320
We are building these enormous machines

32:33.320 --> 32:38.320
that are harnessing enormous amounts of chemical power

32:40.400 --> 32:42.920
in very, very compact packages.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.360
It's truly extraordinary.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.040
But then there's all the different components

32:47.040 --> 32:49.960
and the materials involved.

32:49.960 --> 32:52.200
Is there something interesting that you can describe

32:52.200 --> 32:57.040
about the materials that comprise the rocket?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.800
So it has to be as light as possible, I guess,

32:59.800 --> 33:03.120
whilst withstanding the heat and the harsh conditions?

33:03.600 --> 33:05.960
I play a little kind of game sometimes

33:05.960 --> 33:08.480
with other rocket people that I run into,

33:08.480 --> 33:10.760
where I say, what are the things

33:10.760 --> 33:13.920
that would amaze the 1960s engineers?

33:13.920 --> 33:15.360
Like, what's the change?

33:15.360 --> 33:18.640
Because surprisingly, some of Rocketry's greatest hits

33:18.640 --> 33:19.880
have not changed.

33:19.880 --> 33:22.680
They are still, they would recognize immediately

33:22.680 --> 33:24.160
a lot of what we do today.

33:24.160 --> 33:27.960
And it's exactly what they pioneered back in the 60s.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.840
But a few things have changed.

33:30.840 --> 33:35.840
The use of carbon composites is very different today.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.880
We can build very sophisticated,

33:39.880 --> 33:42.720
you saw our carbon tape laying machine

33:42.720 --> 33:44.960
that builds the giant fairings.

33:44.960 --> 33:48.600
And we can build these incredibly light,

33:48.600 --> 33:52.000
very stiff fairing structures

33:52.000 --> 33:55.360
out of carbon composite material

33:55.360 --> 33:57.560
that they could not have dreamed of.

33:57.600 --> 34:02.200
I mean, the structural efficiency of that material

34:02.200 --> 34:06.320
is so high compared to any metallic material

34:06.320 --> 34:08.200
you might use or anything else.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.120
So that's one.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.720
Aluminum lithium and the ability

34:14.720 --> 34:17.480
to friction stir weld aluminum lithium.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.200
Do you remember the friction stir welding

34:19.200 --> 34:20.840
that I showed you?

34:20.840 --> 34:23.320
This is a remarkable technology.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.920
This invented decades ago,

34:24.920 --> 34:26.760
but has become very practical

34:26.760 --> 34:29.440
over just the last couple of decades.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.920
And instead of using heat

34:31.920 --> 34:34.840
to weld two pieces of metal together,

34:34.840 --> 34:37.360
it literally stirs the two pieces.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.800
There's a pin that rotates at a certain rate,

34:40.800 --> 34:44.160
and you put that pin between the two plates of metal

34:44.160 --> 34:46.040
that you wanna weld together,

34:46.040 --> 34:50.840
and then you move it at a very precise speed.

34:50.840 --> 34:53.040
And instead of heating the material,

34:53.040 --> 34:54.600
it heats it a little bit because of friction,

34:54.600 --> 34:55.440
but not very much.

34:55.440 --> 34:57.600
Literally, immediately after welding

34:57.600 --> 34:58.560
with stir friction welding,

34:58.560 --> 35:01.440
you can touch the material and it's just barely warm.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.840
It literally stirs the molecules together.

35:04.840 --> 35:05.960
It's quite extraordinary.

35:05.960 --> 35:07.120
Relatively low temperature,

35:07.120 --> 35:09.800
and I guess high temperature is what makes them,

35:09.800 --> 35:11.560
that makes it a weak point.

35:11.560 --> 35:16.040
Exactly, so with traditional welding techniques,

35:16.040 --> 35:19.840
you may have whatever the underlying strength characteristics

35:19.840 --> 35:21.360
of the material are,

35:21.360 --> 35:24.560
you end up with weak regions where you weld.

35:24.560 --> 35:26.560
And with friction stir welding,

35:26.560 --> 35:29.720
the welds are just as strong as the bulk material.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.000
So it really allows you,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.120
because when you're, let's say you're building a tank

35:34.120 --> 35:35.960
that you're gonna pressurize,

35:35.960 --> 35:38.360
a large liquid natural gas tank

35:38.360 --> 35:41.760
for our booster stage, for example,

35:41.760 --> 35:44.160
if you are welding that with traditional methods,

35:44.160 --> 35:46.240
you have to size those weld lands,

35:46.240 --> 35:48.120
the thickness of those pieces

35:48.120 --> 35:50.400
with that knockdown for whatever damage you're doing

35:50.400 --> 35:51.240
with the weld,

35:51.240 --> 35:53.880
and that's gonna add a lot of weight to that tank.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.440
I mean, even just looking at the fairings,

35:56.440 --> 35:58.120
the result of that,

35:58.120 --> 36:00.600
the complex shape that it takes

36:00.600 --> 36:04.760
and what it's supposed to do is kind of incredible

36:04.760 --> 36:06.680
because people don't know it's on top of the rock,

36:06.680 --> 36:08.600
it's gonna fall apart.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.720
That's its task,

36:09.720 --> 36:12.040
but it has to stay strong sometimes

36:12.040 --> 36:14.920
and then disappear when it needs to.

36:14.920 --> 36:15.760
That's right.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.320
It's a very difficult task.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.320
Yes, when you need something

36:19.320 --> 36:22.360
that needs to have 100% integrity

36:22.360 --> 36:24.880
until it needs to have 0% integrity,

36:24.880 --> 36:28.280
it needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away

36:28.280 --> 36:29.120
and then when it goes away,

36:29.120 --> 36:30.920
it has to go away completely.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.720
You use explosive charges for that.

36:33.720 --> 36:38.520
And so it's a very robust way of separating structure

36:39.480 --> 36:40.320
when you need to.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.280
Exploding.

36:41.280 --> 36:45.800
Yeah, little tiny bits of explosive material

36:45.800 --> 36:49.880
and it just, it'll sever the whole connection.

36:49.880 --> 36:54.680
So if you wanna go from 100% structural integrity

36:54.680 --> 36:58.080
to zero as fast as possible, it's explosives.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.760
Use explosives.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.120
The entirety of this thing is so bad ass.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.200
Okay, so we're back to the two stages.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.320
So the first stage is reusable.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.840
Yeah, second stage is expendable.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.320
Second stage is liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen,

37:11.320 --> 37:14.240
so we get to take advantage of the higher specific impulse.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.560
The first stage lands downrange

37:19.560 --> 37:22.240
on a landing platform in the ocean,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.200
comes back for maintenance

37:24.200 --> 37:26.280
and get ready to do the next mission.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.320
I mean, there's a million questions,

37:28.320 --> 37:31.240
but also is there a path towards reusability

37:31.240 --> 37:32.680
for the second stage?

37:32.680 --> 37:35.720
There is, and we know how to do that.

37:35.720 --> 37:39.200
Right now, we're gonna work on manufacturing

37:39.200 --> 37:42.880
that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.600
Sort of two paths for a second stage.

37:45.600 --> 37:50.080
Make it reusable or work really hard

37:50.080 --> 37:53.640
to make it inexpensive so you can afford to expend it.

37:53.640 --> 37:58.640
And that trade is actually not obvious

37:59.080 --> 38:00.720
which one is better.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.760
Even in terms of cost, like time, cost.

38:02.760 --> 38:05.960
Even in terms of cost, and I'm talking about cost.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.720
Space flight, getting into orbit is a solved problem.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.600
We solved it back in the 50s and 60s.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.200
The only thing, the only interesting problem

38:15.200 --> 38:19.200
is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.960
Which is, if you can do that,

38:21.960 --> 38:26.200
you open up a bunch of new endeavors

38:26.200 --> 38:28.800
that lots of startup companies, everybody else can do.

38:28.800 --> 38:33.400
So that's, we really, that's one of our missions

38:33.400 --> 38:37.720
is to be part of this industry and lower the cost to orbit

38:37.720 --> 38:42.440
so that there can be a kind of a renaissance,

38:42.440 --> 38:45.440
a golden age of people doing all kinds

38:45.440 --> 38:47.320
of interesting things in space.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.560
I like how you said getting to orbit is a solved problem.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.560
It's just the only interesting thing is reducing the cost.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.200
You know you can describe every single problem

38:55.200 --> 38:57.520
facing human civilization that way.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.760
Physicists would say everything is a solved problem.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.840
We've solved everything.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.840
The rest is just, well as Rutherford said that,

39:04.840 --> 39:06.520
it's just stamp collecting.

39:06.520 --> 39:07.760
It's just the details.

39:07.760 --> 39:10.120
Some of the greatest innovations and inventions

39:10.120 --> 39:15.120
and brilliance is in that cost reduction stage, right?

39:15.120 --> 39:18.000
And you've had a long career of cost reduction.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.800
For sure, and you know, when you,

39:20.800 --> 39:22.680
what does cost reduction really mean?

39:22.680 --> 39:24.480
It means inventing a better way.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.320
Yeah, exactly.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.960
Right, and when you invent a better way,

39:26.960 --> 39:28.920
you make the whole world richer.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.480
So you know, whatever it was,

39:30.480 --> 39:32.080
I don't know how many thousands of years ago,

39:32.080 --> 39:34.280
somebody invented the plow.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.960
And when they invented the plow,

39:35.960 --> 39:37.360
they made the whole world richer

39:37.360 --> 39:40.280
because they made farming less expensive.

39:40.280 --> 39:45.280
And so it is a big deal to invent better ways.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.560
That's how the world gets richer.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.480
So what are some of the biggest challenges

39:52.480 --> 39:54.840
on the manufacturing side and the engineering side

39:54.840 --> 39:58.640
that you're facing in working to get

39:58.640 --> 40:00.360
to the first launch of New Glenn?

40:01.280 --> 40:03.320
The first launch is one thing,

40:03.320 --> 40:07.120
and we'll do that in 2024 coming up in this coming year.

40:07.120 --> 40:09.960
The real thing that's the bigger challenge

40:09.960 --> 40:12.800
is making sure that our factory

40:12.800 --> 40:17.800
is efficiently manufacturing at rate.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.920
So rate production.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.520
So consider if you wanna launch New Glenn,

40:23.520 --> 40:26.000
you know, 24 times a year,

40:26.000 --> 40:30.080
you need to manufacture a upper stage

40:30.080 --> 40:34.880
since they're expendable every, you know, twice a month,

40:34.880 --> 40:36.360
you need to do it every two weeks.

40:36.360 --> 40:41.000
So you need to have all of your manufacturing facilities

40:41.000 --> 40:43.480
and processes and inspection techniques

40:43.480 --> 40:47.800
and acceptance tests and everything operating at rate.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.680
And rate manufacturing is at least as difficult

40:51.680 --> 40:55.400
as designing the vehicle in the first place.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.240
And the same thing.

40:56.240 --> 41:01.240
So every upper stage has two BE3U engines.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.360
So those engines, you know, you need,

41:05.360 --> 41:08.600
if you're gonna launch the vehicle twice a month,

41:08.600 --> 41:09.880
you need four engines a month.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.640
So you need an engine every week.

41:11.640 --> 41:12.880
So you need to be,

41:12.880 --> 41:16.560
that engine needs to be being produced at rate.

41:16.560 --> 41:20.640
And there's all of the things that you need to do that,

41:20.640 --> 41:24.440
all the right machine tools, all the right fixtures,

41:24.480 --> 41:27.000
the right people, process, et cetera.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.960
So it's one thing to build a first article, right?

41:30.960 --> 41:35.100
So that's, you know, to launch New Glenn for the first time,

41:35.100 --> 41:37.440
you need to produce a first article.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.840
But that's not the hard part.

41:39.840 --> 41:42.520
The hard part is everything that's going on

41:42.520 --> 41:45.440
behind the scenes to build a factory

41:45.440 --> 41:47.680
that can produce New Glenns at rate.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.200
So the first one is produced in a way that's,

41:50.200 --> 41:52.120
enables the production of the second and the third

41:52.120 --> 41:53.160
and the fourth and the fifth and the sixth.

41:53.160 --> 41:57.520
You could think of the first article as kind of pushing,

41:57.520 --> 42:02.520
it pushes all of the rate manufacturing technology along.

42:02.560 --> 42:06.640
You know, in other words, it's kind of the, you know,

42:06.640 --> 42:09.100
it's the test article in a way

42:09.100 --> 42:13.240
that's testing out your manufacturing technologies.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.760
The manufacturing is the big challenge.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.720
Yes, I mean, I don't wanna make it sound

42:17.720 --> 42:19.000
like any of it is easy.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.760
I mean, the people who are designing the engines

42:21.760 --> 42:25.200
and all of this, all of it is hard for sure.

42:25.200 --> 42:29.920
But the challenge right now is driving really hard

42:29.920 --> 42:32.880
to get to, is to get to rate manufacturing

42:32.880 --> 42:34.080
and to do that in an efficient way.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.760
Again, kind of back to our cost point.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.960
If you get to rate manufacturing in an inefficient way,

42:39.960 --> 42:41.880
you haven't really solved the cost problem

42:41.880 --> 42:43.800
and maybe you haven't really moved

42:43.800 --> 42:45.200
the state of the art forward.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.000
All this has to be about moving

42:47.000 --> 42:48.160
the state of the art forward.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.120
There are easier businesses to do.

42:50.120 --> 42:53.240
I always tell people, look, if you are trying to make money,

42:53.240 --> 42:56.160
you know, like start a salty snack food company

42:56.160 --> 42:58.120
or something, you know.

42:58.120 --> 42:59.400
You write that idea down.

42:59.400 --> 43:03.840
Like, make the Lex Fridman potato chips.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.680
You know, this is.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.840
Okay, don't say it, people are gonna steal it.

43:06.840 --> 43:10.040
But yeah, it's hard.

43:10.040 --> 43:10.880
You see what I'm saying?

43:10.880 --> 43:14.080
It's like, there's nothing easy about this business

43:14.080 --> 43:17.160
and, but it's its own reward.

43:17.160 --> 43:22.080
It's fascinating, it's worthwhile, it's meaningful.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.840
And so, you know, I don't wanna pick

43:24.840 --> 43:26.320
on salty snack food companies,

43:26.320 --> 43:28.280
but I think it's less meaningful.

43:28.280 --> 43:29.440
You know, at the end of the day,

43:29.440 --> 43:33.360
you're not gonna have accomplished something amazing.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.200
Yeah, there's.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.760
Even if you do make a lot of money at it.

43:35.760 --> 43:37.320
Yeah, there's something fundamentally different

43:37.320 --> 43:41.400
about the quote unquote business of space exploration.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.520
Yeah, for sure.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.160
It's a grand project of humanity.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.600
Yes, it's one of humanity's grand challenges.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.480
And especially as you look at going to the moon

43:50.480 --> 43:54.040
and going to Mars and building giant O'Neill colonies

43:54.040 --> 43:55.440
and unlocking all the things.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.400
You know, I won't live long enough

43:58.400 --> 44:01.200
to see the fruits of this,

44:01.200 --> 44:06.200
but the fruits of this come from building a road to space,

44:06.880 --> 44:08.960
getting the infrastructure.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.440
I give you an analogy.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.640
When I started Amazon,

44:12.640 --> 44:15.560
I didn't have to develop a payment system.

44:15.560 --> 44:16.400
It already existed.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.040
It was called the credit card.

44:18.040 --> 44:21.320
I didn't have to develop a transportation system

44:21.320 --> 44:22.640
to deliver the packages.

44:22.640 --> 44:23.640
It already existed.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.440
It was called the postal service

44:25.440 --> 44:28.640
and Royal Mail and Deutsche Post and so on.

44:28.640 --> 44:32.240
So all this heavy lifting infrastructure

44:32.240 --> 44:36.720
was already in place and I could stand on its shoulders.

44:36.720 --> 44:39.800
And that's why when you look at the internet,

44:40.800 --> 44:41.760
you know, by the way,

44:41.760 --> 44:43.280
another giant piece of infrastructure

44:43.280 --> 44:44.280
that was around in the early,

44:44.280 --> 44:46.760
I'm taking you back to like 1994,

44:46.760 --> 44:48.960
people were using dial-up modems

44:48.960 --> 44:50.720
and it was piggybacking

44:50.720 --> 44:53.400
on top of the long distance phone network.

44:53.400 --> 44:54.720
That's how the internet,

44:54.720 --> 44:58.600
that's how people were accessing servers and so on.

44:58.600 --> 45:02.160
And again, if that hadn't existed,

45:02.160 --> 45:04.760
it would have been hundreds of billions of capex

45:04.760 --> 45:06.440
to put that out there.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.120
No startup company could have done that.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.680
And so the problem, you know,

45:11.680 --> 45:15.200
you see if you look at the dynamism

45:15.200 --> 45:18.600
in the internet space over the last 20 years,

45:18.600 --> 45:19.680
it's because, you know,

45:19.680 --> 45:22.360
you see like two kids in a dorm room

45:22.360 --> 45:23.800
could start an internet company

45:23.800 --> 45:26.440
that could be successful and do amazing things

45:26.440 --> 45:28.680
because they didn't have to build heavy infrastructure.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.400
It was already there.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.800
And that's what I wanna do.

45:32.800 --> 45:36.760
I take, you know, my Amazon winnings

45:36.760 --> 45:39.080
and use that to build heavy infrastructure

45:40.080 --> 45:41.720
so that the next generation,

45:41.720 --> 45:44.400
you know, the generation that's my children

45:44.400 --> 45:46.280
and their children,

45:46.280 --> 45:50.160
those generations can then use that heavy infrastructure.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.920
Then there'll be space entrepreneurs

45:51.920 --> 45:53.600
who start in their dorm room.

45:53.600 --> 45:56.640
Like that will be a marker of success

45:56.640 --> 46:00.080
when you can have a really valuable space company

46:00.080 --> 46:01.800
started in a dorm room,

46:01.800 --> 46:04.880
then we know that we've built enough infrastructure

46:04.880 --> 46:09.000
so that ingenuity and imagination can really be unleashed.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.480
I find that very exciting.

46:11.480 --> 46:13.320
They will, of course, as kids do,

46:13.320 --> 46:16.440
take all of this hard infrastructure building for granted.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.440
Of course.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.360
Which is the entrepreneurial spirit.

46:19.360 --> 46:23.520
That's an inventor's greatest dream

46:23.520 --> 46:26.600
is that their inventions are so successful

46:26.600 --> 46:29.120
that they are one day taken for granted.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.760
You know, nobody thinks of Amazon as an invention anymore.

46:31.760 --> 46:34.040
Nobody thinks of customer reviews as an invention.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.280
We pioneered customer reviews,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.240
but now they're so commonplace.

46:37.280 --> 46:39.440
Same thing with one-click shopping and so on.

46:39.440 --> 46:40.640
But that's a compliment.

46:40.640 --> 46:45.560
That's how, you know, you invent something that's so used,

46:45.560 --> 46:48.520
so beneficially used by so many people

46:48.520 --> 46:49.880
that they take it for granted.

46:49.880 --> 46:50.880
I don't know about nobody.

46:50.880 --> 46:52.720
Every time I use Amazon, I'm still amazed.

46:52.720 --> 46:53.560
How does this work?

46:53.560 --> 46:55.960
The logistics, the work.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
That proves you're a very curious explorer.

46:57.960 --> 47:00.000
All right, all right, back to rockets.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.280
Timeline, you said 2024.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.400
As it stands now,

47:06.400 --> 47:08.200
are both the first test launch

47:08.200 --> 47:11.640
and the launch of Escapade Explorers to Mars still possible

47:11.640 --> 47:12.800
in 2024? In 2024?

47:12.800 --> 47:14.880
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.280
For sure, the first launch,

47:16.280 --> 47:19.480
and then we'll see if Escapade goes on that or not.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.000
I think that the first launch for sure,

47:21.000 --> 47:22.640
and I hope Escapade too.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.640
I hope.

47:24.640 --> 47:26.440
Well, I just don't know which mission

47:26.440 --> 47:28.520
it's actually gonna be slated on.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.000
So we also have other things

47:30.000 --> 47:31.640
that might go on that first mission.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.480
Oh, I got it.

47:32.480 --> 47:35.280
But you're optimistic that the launches will still...

47:35.280 --> 47:36.280
Oh, the first launch.

47:36.280 --> 47:38.000
I'm very optimistic that the first launch

47:38.000 --> 47:39.680
of New Glenn will be in 2024.

47:39.680 --> 47:41.920
And I'm just not 100% certain

47:41.920 --> 47:44.680
what payload will be on that first launch.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.160
Are you nervous about it?

47:46.160 --> 47:47.000
Are you kidding?

47:47.000 --> 47:48.760
I'm extremely nervous about it.

47:48.760 --> 47:52.600
Oh, man.

47:52.600 --> 47:54.440
100%.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.360
Every launch I go to for New Shepard,

47:58.360 --> 48:00.000
for other vehicles too,

48:00.000 --> 48:02.080
I'm always nervous for these launches.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.160
But yes, for sure.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.880
The first launch, to have no nervousness about that

48:05.880 --> 48:09.800
would be some sign of derangement, I think.

48:09.800 --> 48:10.920
Well, I got to visit the launch,

48:10.920 --> 48:14.720
but it's pretty epic.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.760
We have done a tremendous amount of ground testing,

48:18.760 --> 48:21.880
a tremendous amount of simulation.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.600
So a lot of the problems

48:25.600 --> 48:27.960
that we might find in flight have been resolved.

48:27.960 --> 48:30.240
But there are some problems you can only find in flight.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.400
So cross your fingers.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.240
I guarantee you, you'll have fun watching it

48:36.240 --> 48:37.080
no matter what happens.

48:37.080 --> 48:41.320
100%, when the thing is fully assembled, it comes up.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.520
Yeah, the transporter erector,

48:44.520 --> 48:46.640
just the transporter erector

48:46.640 --> 48:49.520
for a rocket of this scale is extraordinary.

48:49.520 --> 48:50.360
That's an incredible machine.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.520
The vehicle travels out horizontally

48:53.520 --> 48:56.960
and then kind of comes up.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.280
Over a few hours?

48:58.280 --> 49:00.120
Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to watch.

49:00.720 --> 49:04.200
Speaking of which, if that makes you nervous,

49:04.200 --> 49:05.600
I don't know if you remember,

49:06.520 --> 49:11.160
but you were aboard New Shepard

49:11.160 --> 49:13.640
on its first crewed flight.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.840
How was that experience?

49:16.840 --> 49:19.040
Were you terrified then?

49:20.160 --> 49:22.040
You know, strangely, I wasn't.

49:22.040 --> 49:22.880
You know, I-

49:22.880 --> 49:23.720
You ride the rocket.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.560
It's true.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.480
I've watched other people ride in the rocket

49:27.480 --> 49:28.680
and I'm more nervous

49:28.680 --> 49:31.240
than when I was inside the rocket myself.

49:32.360 --> 49:35.560
It was a difficult conversation to have with my mother

49:35.560 --> 49:38.680
when I told her I was gonna go on the first one.

49:38.680 --> 49:39.920
And not only was I gonna go,

49:39.920 --> 49:41.560
but I was gonna bring my brother too.

49:41.560 --> 49:44.120
This is a tough conversation to have with a mom.

49:44.120 --> 49:44.960
And-

49:44.960 --> 49:47.160
There's a long pause when you told her.

49:47.160 --> 49:48.360
She's like, both of you?

49:51.320 --> 49:54.400
It was an incredible experience.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.440
We were laughing inside the capsule

49:58.440 --> 50:00.960
and, you know, we're not nervous.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.200
The people on the ground were very nervous for us.

50:07.280 --> 50:11.960
It was actually one of the most emotionally powerful parts

50:11.960 --> 50:15.240
of the experience was not,

50:15.240 --> 50:17.640
happened even before the flight.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.200
At 4.30 in the morning,

50:20.120 --> 50:22.520
brother and I are getting ready to go to the launch site

50:22.560 --> 50:25.160
and Lauren is gonna take us there in her helicopter

50:25.160 --> 50:26.600
and we're getting ready to leave.

50:26.600 --> 50:29.640
And we go outside, outside the ranch house there

50:29.640 --> 50:32.640
in West Texas where the launch facility is.

50:32.640 --> 50:37.240
And all of our family, my kids and my brother's kids

50:37.240 --> 50:42.240
and our parents and close friends are assembled there

50:46.480 --> 50:48.280
and they're saying goodbye to us,

50:48.280 --> 50:50.480
but they're kind of saying,

50:50.480 --> 50:54.120
maybe they think they're saying goodbye to us forever.

50:54.120 --> 50:56.080
And, you know, we might not have felt that way

50:56.080 --> 50:58.800
but it was obvious from their faces how nervous they were

50:58.800 --> 51:00.400
that they felt that way.

51:00.400 --> 51:03.760
And it was sort of powerful because it allowed us to see,

51:03.760 --> 51:05.800
it was almost like attending your own memorial service

51:05.800 --> 51:08.560
or something like you could feel how loved you were

51:08.560 --> 51:09.560
in that moment.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.840
And it was really amazing.

51:12.840 --> 51:17.480
Yeah, and I mean, there's just a epic nature to it too.

51:17.520 --> 51:21.000
The ascent, the floating zero gravity,

51:21.000 --> 51:22.720
I'll tell you something very interesting.

51:22.720 --> 51:25.160
Zero gravity feels very natural.

51:25.160 --> 51:28.920
I don't know if it's because we're, you know,

51:28.920 --> 51:30.760
it's like return to the womb or what it is.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.440
You just confirmed you're an alien, but that's all.

51:32.440 --> 51:36.440
I think that's what you just said.

51:36.440 --> 51:38.520
It feels so natural to be in zero G.

51:38.520 --> 51:39.360
It was really interesting.

51:39.360 --> 51:42.000
And then when people talk about the overview effect

51:42.000 --> 51:44.320
and seeing earth from space,

51:44.320 --> 51:46.120
I had that feeling very powerful.

51:46.120 --> 51:47.960
I think everyone did.

51:49.280 --> 51:51.640
You see how fragile the earth is.

51:51.640 --> 51:55.040
If you're not an environmentalist, it will make you one.

51:55.040 --> 51:57.360
The great Jim Lovell quote, you know,

51:57.360 --> 52:00.280
he looked back at the earth from space and he said,

52:00.280 --> 52:03.280
he realized you don't go to heaven when you die,

52:03.280 --> 52:05.360
you go to heaven when you're born.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.960
And it's just, you know,

52:06.960 --> 52:09.400
that's the feeling that people get when they're in space.

52:09.400 --> 52:12.040
You see all this blackness, all this nothingness,

52:12.040 --> 52:15.200
and there's one gem of life and it's earth.

52:15.200 --> 52:16.600
It is a gem.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.920
What, you know, you've talked a lot about decision-making

52:20.920 --> 52:23.120
throughout your time with Amazon.

52:23.120 --> 52:27.400
What was that decision like to be the first

52:27.400 --> 52:29.040
to ride in your shepherd?

52:29.040 --> 52:31.200
Just before you talk to your mom.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.040
Yeah.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.240
What, like the pros and cons.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.000
Like actually as one human being,

52:37.000 --> 52:41.440
as a leader of a company on all fronts,

52:41.440 --> 52:43.200
like what was that decision-making like?

52:43.200 --> 52:45.440
I decided that, first of all,

52:45.440 --> 52:48.160
I knew the vehicle extremely well.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.720
I know the team who built it.

52:49.720 --> 52:51.040
I know the vehicle.

52:53.520 --> 52:57.920
I'm very comfortable with like the escape system.

52:57.920 --> 53:02.040
We put as much effort into the escape system

53:02.040 --> 53:04.600
on that vehicle as we put into all the rest

53:04.600 --> 53:05.760
of the vehicle combined.

53:05.760 --> 53:08.160
It's one of the hardest pieces of engineering

53:08.160 --> 53:10.360
in the entire new shepherd architecture.

53:10.360 --> 53:11.880
Can you actually describe what do you mean

53:11.880 --> 53:13.480
by escape system, what's involved?

53:13.480 --> 53:18.480
We have a solid rocket motor in the base of the crew capsule

53:18.920 --> 53:22.600
so that if anything goes wrong on ascent,

53:23.440 --> 53:26.600
you know, while the main rocket engine is firing,

53:26.600 --> 53:30.240
we can ignite this solid rocket motor

53:30.240 --> 53:35.240
in the base of the crew capsule and escape from the booster.

53:35.720 --> 53:38.400
It's a very challenging system to build,

53:38.400 --> 53:42.240
design, validate, test, all of these things.

53:42.240 --> 53:44.880
It is the reason that I am comfortable

53:44.880 --> 53:47.320
letting anyone go on new shepherd.

53:47.320 --> 53:52.320
So the booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it,

53:53.200 --> 53:56.320
but we're harnessing,

53:56.320 --> 53:59.000
whenever you're talking about rocket engines,

53:59.000 --> 54:02.240
I don't care what rocket engine you're talking about,

54:02.240 --> 54:06.120
you're harnessing such vast power

54:06.120 --> 54:10.120
in such a small compact geometric space.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.720
The power density is so enormous

54:13.720 --> 54:16.720
that it is impossible to ever be sure

54:16.720 --> 54:18.880
that nothing will go wrong.

54:18.880 --> 54:23.040
And so the only way to improve safety

54:23.040 --> 54:24.640
is to have an escape system.

54:24.640 --> 54:27.400
And you know, and historically rockets,

54:27.400 --> 54:29.520
human rated rockets have had escape systems,

54:29.520 --> 54:32.640
only the space shuttle did not.

54:32.680 --> 54:37.120
And, but Apollo had one, the, you know,

54:37.120 --> 54:39.640
all of the previous, you know, Gemini, et cetera,

54:39.640 --> 54:41.120
they all had escape systems.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.080
And we have on new shepherd, unusual escapes,

54:46.080 --> 54:48.480
most escape systems are towers.

54:48.480 --> 54:50.080
We have a pusher escape system.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.240
So the solid rocket motor is actually embedded

54:52.240 --> 54:54.800
in the base of the crew capsule and it pushes.

54:54.800 --> 54:58.880
And it's reusable in the sense that if we don't use it,

54:58.880 --> 55:01.960
so if we have a nominal mission, we land with it.

55:01.960 --> 55:04.480
The tower systems have to be ejected

55:04.480 --> 55:06.280
at a certain point in the mission.

55:06.280 --> 55:09.240
And so they get wasted even in a nominal mission.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.520
And so again, you know,

55:10.520 --> 55:12.280
costs really matters on these things.

55:12.280 --> 55:14.200
So we figured out how to have the escape system

55:14.200 --> 55:17.960
be a reusable in the event that it's not used,

55:17.960 --> 55:21.240
you can reuse it and have it be a pusher system.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.960
It's a very sophisticated thing.

55:22.960 --> 55:26.760
So I knew these things, you asked me about my decision to go.

55:26.760 --> 55:28.600
And so I know the vehicle very well.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.360
I know the people who designed it.

55:31.360 --> 55:34.560
I have great trust in them and in the engineering

55:34.560 --> 55:35.400
that we did.

55:36.320 --> 55:40.320
And I thought to myself, look, if I am not ready to go,

55:40.320 --> 55:43.520
then I wouldn't want anyone to go.

55:43.520 --> 55:47.320
A tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view

55:47.320 --> 55:50.200
to have very, to be as safe as one can make it.

55:51.240 --> 55:54.520
You can't make it perfectly safe, it's impossible.

55:54.520 --> 55:58.000
But you know, you just have to, people will do things.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
People take risks, you know, they climb mountains,

56:00.000 --> 56:02.840
they, you know, they skydive, they, you know,

56:02.840 --> 56:05.520
do deep underwater scuba diving and so on.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.040
People are okay taking risk.

56:08.040 --> 56:12.080
You can't eliminate the risk, but it is something

56:12.080 --> 56:13.640
because it's a tourism vehicle,

56:13.640 --> 56:16.800
you have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks.

56:16.800 --> 56:19.040
And I felt very good about the system.

56:19.040 --> 56:23.080
I think that's one of the reasons I was so calm inside.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.480
Maybe others weren't as calm.

56:24.480 --> 56:26.400
They didn't know as much about it as I did.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.840
Who was in charge of engaging the escape system?

56:28.840 --> 56:29.720
It's automated.

56:30.680 --> 56:34.120
The escape system is completely automated.

56:34.120 --> 56:38.480
Automated is better because it can react so much faster.

56:38.480 --> 56:41.880
So yeah, for tourism rockets, safety is a huge, huge,

56:41.880 --> 56:44.040
huge priority for space exploration also,

56:44.040 --> 56:46.760
but a little, you know, a delta less.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.240
Yes, I mean, I think for, you know, if you're doing,

56:49.240 --> 56:51.080
you know, there are human activities

56:51.080 --> 56:52.520
where we tolerate more risk.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.400
If you're saving somebody's life, you know,

56:55.400 --> 57:00.120
if you are, you know, engaging in real exploration,

57:00.120 --> 57:02.520
these are things where, you know,

57:02.520 --> 57:07.320
I personally think we would accept more risk

57:07.320 --> 57:08.760
in part because you have to.

57:09.640 --> 57:12.840
Is there a part of you that's frustrated

57:12.840 --> 57:15.920
by the rate of progress in Blue Origin?

57:15.920 --> 57:18.160
Blue Origin needs to be much faster.

57:18.160 --> 57:21.600
And it's one of the reasons that I left my role

57:21.640 --> 57:25.640
as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.080
I needed, I wanted to come in

57:27.080 --> 57:29.960
and Blue Origin needs me right now.

57:29.960 --> 57:33.360
And so I had always, when I was the CEO of Amazon,

57:33.360 --> 57:35.960
my point of view on this is if I'm the CEO

57:35.960 --> 57:38.120
of a publicly traded company,

57:38.120 --> 57:39.840
it's gonna get my full attention.

57:39.840 --> 57:44.720
And I really, it's just how I think about things.

57:44.720 --> 57:46.000
It was very important to me.

57:46.000 --> 57:49.520
I felt I had an obligation to all the stakeholders

57:49.560 --> 57:52.320
at Amazon to do that.

57:52.320 --> 57:55.200
And so having, you know, turned the CEO,

57:55.200 --> 57:56.560
I'm still the executive chair there,

57:56.560 --> 57:59.320
but I've turned the CEO role over.

57:59.320 --> 58:03.320
And the reason, the primary reason I did that

58:03.320 --> 58:06.000
is so that I could spend time on Blue Origin,

58:06.000 --> 58:09.600
adding some, you know, energy, some sense of urgency.

58:09.600 --> 58:11.360
We need to move much faster.

58:11.360 --> 58:12.400
And we're going to.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.040
What are the ways to speed it up?

58:15.080 --> 58:20.080
So I mean, there's, you've talked a lot of different ways

58:20.320 --> 58:24.920
to sort of, at Amazon, you know,

58:24.920 --> 58:29.640
removing barriers for progress,

58:29.640 --> 58:31.720
sort of distributing, making everybody autonomous

58:31.720 --> 58:34.640
and self-reliant in terms, all those kinds of things.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.440
Does that apply at Blue Origin or is?

58:37.440 --> 58:38.720
It does apply.

58:38.720 --> 58:41.520
I know I'm leading this directly.

58:41.520 --> 58:44.560
We are gonna become the world's most decisive company.

58:45.160 --> 58:47.120
Across any industry.

58:47.120 --> 58:51.360
And so, you know, at Amazon for, you know,

58:51.360 --> 58:53.680
forever since the beginning,

58:53.680 --> 58:56.520
I said, we're gonna become the world's most

58:56.520 --> 58:58.400
customer obsessed company.

58:59.280 --> 59:01.680
And no matter the industry, like people,

59:01.680 --> 59:03.800
one day people are going to come to Amazon

59:03.800 --> 59:05.520
from the healthcare industry and wanna know,

59:05.520 --> 59:06.920
how did you guys, how do you,

59:06.920 --> 59:08.320
how are you so customer obsessed?

59:08.320 --> 59:10.240
How do you actually, not just pay lip service

59:10.240 --> 59:11.560
but actually do that.

59:12.080 --> 59:15.480
And from, you know, all different industries

59:15.480 --> 59:18.920
should come on to study us to see how we accomplish that.

59:18.920 --> 59:21.800
And the analogous thing at Blue Origin

59:21.800 --> 59:24.240
and will help us move faster

59:24.240 --> 59:28.840
is we're gonna become the world's most decisive company.

59:28.840 --> 59:31.600
We're gonna get really good at taking appropriate

59:31.600 --> 59:34.600
technology risk and making those decisions quickly.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.360
You know, being bold on those things.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.400
That's what, and having the right culture

59:39.400 --> 59:40.840
that supports that.

59:40.840 --> 59:44.640
You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious.

59:44.640 --> 59:47.480
You know, if there are five ways to do something,

59:47.480 --> 59:49.680
we'll study them, but let's study them very quickly

59:49.680 --> 59:51.000
and make a decision.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.520
We can always change our mind.

59:53.480 --> 59:56.640
It doesn't, you know, changing your mind.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.920
I talk about one way doors and two way doors.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.840
Most decisions are two way doors.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.680
Can you explain that?

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.800
Because I love that metaphor.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.960
If you make the wrong decision,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.640
if it's a two way door decision,

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.840
you walk out the door, you pick a door, you walk out,

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.440
and you spend a little time there.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.000
It turns out to be the wrong decision.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.200
Come back in and pick another door.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.680
Some decisions are so consequential and so important

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.960
and so hard to reverse

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960
that they really are one way door decisions.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:32.520
You go in that door, you're not coming back.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.400
And those decisions have to be made very deliberately,

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.760
very carefully.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.600
If you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision,

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.240
you should slow down and do that.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:48.080
So, you know, when I, the CEO of Amazon,

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.920
I often found myself in the position

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.200
of being the chief slow down officer

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.640
because somebody would be bringing me

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.360
a one way door decision.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.560
And I was, okay, I can think of three more ways

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.840
to analyze that, so let's go do that.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:04.000
Because we are not gonna be able to reverse this one easily.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:04.920
Maybe you can reverse it,

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.800
but it's gonna be very costly and very time consuming.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.600
We really have to get this one right from the beginning.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:15.600
And what happens, unfortunately,

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.440
in companies, what can happen

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.680
is that you have a one size fits all

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.000
decision making process

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.040
where you end up using the heavyweight process

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.480
on all decisions, including the lightweight ones,

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.240
the two way door decisions.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:35.320
Two way door decisions should mostly be made

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.040
by single individuals or by very small teams

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.240
deep in the organization.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.880
And one way door decisions are the ones

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.320
that are the irreversible ones.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.840
Those are the ones that should be elevated up

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.240
to the senior most executives who should slow them down

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.160
and make sure that the right thing is being done.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.720
Yeah, I mean, part of the skill here

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.400
is to know the difference in one way and two way.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.720
I think you mentioned Amazon Prime.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.520
The decision to sort of create Amazon Prime

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.440
as a one way door.

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.600
I mean, it's unclear if it is or not,

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.480
but it probably is and it's a really big risk to go there.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.360
There are a bunch of decisions like that

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.080
that are changing the decision

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.480
is gonna be very, very complicated.

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.240
Some of them are technical decisions too,

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.840
because some technical decisions

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.240
are like quick drying cement.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.080
Once you make them, it gets really hard.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.560
Choosing which propellants to use in a vehicle.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.840
Selecting LNG for the booster stage

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.120
and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage,

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.480
that has turned out to be a very good decision.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.400
But if you change your mind,

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.720
that would be a very big setback.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.280
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.600
So that's the kind of decision

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.480
you scrutinize very, very carefully.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:58.800
Other things just aren't like that.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.480
Most decisions are not that way.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.360
Most decisions should be made by single individuals,

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.760
but they need and done quickly

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.240
in the full understanding

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.680
that you can always change your mind.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.080
Yeah, one of the things I really liked,

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.000
perhaps it's not a two way door decisions,

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
is I disagree and commit phrase.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.720
So somebody brings up an idea to you,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.680
if it's a two way door,

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.040
you state that you don't understand

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.560
enough to agree, but you still back them.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.760
I'd love for you to explain that.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.840
Yeah, disagree and commit is a really important principle

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.560
that saves a lot of arguing.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.680
Yeah, I'm gonna use that in my personal life.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.200
I disagree, but commit.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.360
It's very common in any endeavor in life,

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:51.400
in business, in anybody where you have teammates,

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:53.920
you have a teammate and the two of you disagree.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.480
At some point you have to make a decision.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.120
In companies, we tend to organize hierarchically.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.560
So whoever's the more senior person

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.000
ultimately gets to make the decision.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.520
So ultimately the CEO gets to make that decision.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.720
And the CEO may not always make the decision

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.760
that they agree with.

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:16.240
So I would often, I would be the one

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.920
who would disagree and commit.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.080
Some, one of my direct reports

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.440
would very much wanna do something in a particular way.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:26.280
I would think it was a bad idea.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.800
I would explain my point of view.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.120
They would say, Jeff, I think you're wrong and here's why.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.040
And we would go back and forth.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.080
And I would often say, you know what?

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:43.080
I don't think you're right, but I'm gonna gamble with you.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.080
And you're closer to the ground truth than I am.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.000
I'd known you for 20 years.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.400
You have great judgment.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.960
I don't know that I'm right either.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.320
Not really, not for sure.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.640
All these decisions are complicated.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.880
Let's do it your way.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.240
But at least then you've made a decision.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:05.240
And I'm agreeing to commit to that decision.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.920
So I'm not gonna be second guessing it.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.480
I'm not gonna be sniping at it.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.520
I'm not gonna be saying, I told you so.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:14.600
I'm gonna try actively to help make sure it works.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:18.080
That's a really important teammate behavior.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.840
There's so many ways that dispute resolution

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.120
is a really interesting thing on teams.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.480
And there are so many ways when two people

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:29.840
disagree about something, even though I'm assuming

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.200
like the case where everybody is well-intentioned.

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:33.720
They just have a very different opinion

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.320
about what the right decision is.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.480
And we have in our society and inside companies,

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.600
we have a bunch of mechanisms that we use

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.920
to resolve these kinds of disputes.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.280
A lot of them are, I think, really bad.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.320
So an example of a really bad way of coming to agreement

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.280
is compromise.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.320
So compromise, you know, we're in a room here

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.480
and I could say, Lex, how tall do you think this ceiling is?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.320
And you'd be like, I don't know, Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.400
And I would say, I think it's 11 feet tall.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.520
And then we'd say, you know what,

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.240
let's just call it 11 and a half feet.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.520
That's compromise.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.320
Instead of, the right thing to do is to get a tape measure

01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:24.960
or figure out some way of actually measuring.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.120
But think getting that tape measure

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.080
and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.440
and all these things, that requires energy.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.720
Compromise, the advantage of compromise

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.200
as a resolution mechanism is that it's low energy.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.360
But it doesn't lead to truth.

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:44.400
And so in things like the height of the ceiling

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.640
where truth is a knowable thing,

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.880
you shouldn't allow compromise to be used

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.320
when you can know the truth.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.000
Another really bad resolution mechanism

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.600
that happens all the time is just who's more stubborn.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.320
This is also, let's say two executives who disagree

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.720
and they just have a war of attrition.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.480
And whichever one gets exhausted first

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.120
capitulates to the other one.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.160
Again, you haven't arrived at truth

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.920
and this is very demoralizing.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.120
So this is where escalation,

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:23.120
I try to ask people who on my team,

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.720
they say, never get to a point

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.520
where you are resolving something

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.360
by who gets exhausted first.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.680
Escalate that.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.040
I'll help you make the decision.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.680
Because that's so de-energizing

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.840
and it's such a terrible lousy way to make a decision.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.000
Do you wanna get to the resolution as quickly as possible

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.240
because that ultimately leads to a high velocity?

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.720
Yes, and you wanna try to get

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.880
as close to truth as possible.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.880
So exhausting the other person is not truth seeking

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.200
and compromise is not truth seeking.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.880
And there are a lot of cases

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.320
where no one knows the real truth

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:04.720
and that's where disagree and commit can come in.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.920
But escalation is better than war of attrition.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:13.440
Escalate to your boss and say,

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.640
hey, we can't agree on this.

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.640
We like each other, we're respectful of each other,

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.880
but we strongly disagree with each other.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.280
We need you to make a decision here

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.760
so we can move forward.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.720
But decisiveness, moving forward quickly on decisions,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.720
as quickly as you responsibly can

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.400
is how you increase velocity.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.560
Most of what slows things down

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.080
is taking too long to make decisions at all skill levels.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.200
So it has to be part of the culture to get high velocity.

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.680
Amazon has a million and a half people

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.000
and the company is still fast.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.360
We're still decisive, we're still quick.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.240
And that's because the culture supports that.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.760
At every scale in a distributed way,

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.120
it's trying to maximize the velocity of decisions.

01:08:58.120 --> 01:08:59.720
Exactly.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.480
You've mentioned the lunar program.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.600
Let me ask you about that.

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.280
Yeah.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:06.400
There's a lot going on there

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.200
and you haven't really talked about it much.

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.600
So in addition to the Artemis program with NASA,

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.440
Blue is doing its own lander program.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.200
Can you describe it?

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:19.160
There's a sexy picture on Instagram with one of them.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.600
Is it the MK1, I guess?

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.360
Yeah, the Mark 1.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:26.400
The picture is me with Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator.

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.680
Just to clarify, the lander is the sexy thing

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.520
about the Instagram.

01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:31.320
Ha ha ha ha!

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.160
I know it's not me.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.200
I know it was either the lander or Bill.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.040
Okay.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.840
Um, thank you for clarifying.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.560
I love Bill, but yeah, okay.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:45.480
Yes, the Mark 1 lander is designed to take 3,000 kilograms

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:50.840
to the surface of the moon in a cargo, expendable cargo.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.040
It's an expendable lander, lands on the moon, stays there,

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.120
take 3,000 kilograms to the surface.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.920
It can be launched on a single New Glenn flight,

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.200
which is very important.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.000
So it's a relatively simple architecture,

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.680
just like the human landing system lander

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.000
that they call the Mark 2.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.240
Mark 1 is also fueled with liquid hydrogen,

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.760
and which is for high energy missions,

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.760
like landing on the surface of the moon,

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.840
the high specific impulse of hydrogen

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.680
is a very big advantage.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.120
The disadvantage of hydrogen has always been

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.400
that it's such a deep cryogen.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.040
It's not storable.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.040
So it's constantly boiling off,

01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.080
and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:43.480
And so what we're doing as part of our lunar program

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.640
is developing solar powered cryocoolers

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.960
that can actually make hydrogen a storable propellant

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.240
for deep space.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.000
And that's a real game changer.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.240
It's a game changer for any high energy mission.

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.400
So to the moon, but to the outer planets,

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.320
to Mars, everywhere.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.440
So the idea with Mark 1, both Mark 1 and Mark 2

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:08.440
is the new Glenn can carry it from the surface of earth

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.680
to the surface of the moon.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.880
Exactly.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.520
So the Mark 1 is expendable.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:20.280
The lunar lander we're developing for NASA,

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.080
the Mark 2 lander, that's part of the Artemis program.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.560
They call it the Sustaining Lander Program.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.760
So that lander is designed to be reusable.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.000
It can land on the surface of the moon

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.240
in a single stage configuration and then take off.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.600
So the whole, if you look at the Apollo program,

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.240
the lunar lander in Apollo was really two stages.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.960
It would land on the surface,

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.480
and then it would leave the descent stage

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.520
on the surface of the moon.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.920
And only the ascent stage would go back up into lunar orbit

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.840
where it would rendezvous with the command module.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.680
Here, what we're doing is we have a single stage

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.240
lunar lander that carries down enough propellant

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.440
so that it can bring the whole thing back up

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.320
so that it can be reused over and over.

01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.200
And the point of doing that, of course, is to reduce cost

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.840
so that you can make lunar missions

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.640
more affordable over time,

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.640
which is that's one of NASA's big objectives

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.560
because this time the whole point of Artemis

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.560
is go back to the moon, but this time to stay.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.800
So back in the Apollo program,

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.920
we went to the moon six times and then ended the program,

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.240
and it really was too expensive to continue.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.160
And so there's a few questions there,

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.720
but one is how do you stay on the moon?

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.720
What ideas do you have about a sustaining life

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.600
where a few folks can stay there for prolonged periods

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.800
of time?

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.200
Well, one of the things we're working on

01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.200
is using lunar resources like lunar regolith

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.080
to manufacture commodities and even solar cells

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.920
on the surface of the moon.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.360
We've already built a solar cell

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.280
that is completely made from lunar regolith stimulant.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.280
And this solar cell is only about 7% power efficient,

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.840
so it's very inefficient compared to the more advanced

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.600
solar cells that we make here on earth.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.520
But if you can figure out how to make

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.000
a practical solar cell factory

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.960
that you can land on the surface of the moon,

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:37.600
and then the raw material for those solar cells

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.560
is simply lunar regolith,

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.560
then you can just continue to churn out solar cells

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.600
on the surface of the moon,

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.080
have lots of power on the surface of the moon.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.480
That will make it easier for people to live on the moon.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:56.120
Similarly, we're working on extracting oxygen

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.280
from lunar regolith.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.400
So lunar regolith by weight has a lot of oxygen in it.

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:07.400
It's bound very tightly as oxides with other elements.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.680
And so you have to separate the oxygen,

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.720
which is very energy intensive.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.440
So that also could work together with the solar cells.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.880
But if you can, and then ultimately,

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:24.280
we may be able to find practical quantities

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.280
of ice in the permanently shadowed craters

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.940
on the poles of the moon.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:36.680
And we know there is ice water in those,

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.280
or water ice in those craters.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:42.360
And we know that we can break that down

01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.200
with electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen.

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.240
And then you'd not only have oxygen,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.300
but you'd also have a very good,

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:56.300
high efficiency propellant fuel in hydrogen.

01:14:57.220 --> 01:14:59.440
So there's a lot we can do

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.320
to make the moon more sustainable over time.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.640
But the very first step,

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.660
the kind of gate that all of that has to go through

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:12.660
is we need to be able to land cargo and humans

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.720
on the surface of the moon at an acceptable cost.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.200
To fast forward a little bit,

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.800
is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.800
on the moon and on Mars, one or the other or both?

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.840
It's very unlikely.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.340
I think it's probably something that gets done

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.720
by future generations by the time it gets to me.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.500
I think in my lifetime,

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:40.620
that's probably gonna be done by professional astronauts.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.560
Sadly, I would love to sign up for that mission.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.160
So don't count me out yet, Lex.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:50.160
Give me a fighting shot here, maybe.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:55.160
But I think if we are placing reasonable bets

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.160
on such a thing in my lifetime,

01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:59.440
that will continue to be done by professional astronauts.

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:02.360
Yeah, so these are risky, difficult missions.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:05.480
And probably missions that require a lot of training.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.240
You are going there for a very specific purpose

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.600
to do something.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.680
We're gonna be able to do a lot on the moon too

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.040
with automation.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.600
In terms of setting up these factories

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.040
and doing all that,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.560
we're sophisticated enough now with automation

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:21.000
that we probably don't need humans

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.720
to tend those factories and machines.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:28.720
There's a lot that's gonna be done in both modes.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.640
So I have to ask the bigger picture question

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.440
about the two companies pushing humanity forward

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.740
out towards the stars, Blue Origin and SpaceX.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:42.100
Are you competitors, collaborators?

01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:44.100
Which, to what degree?

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.660
Well, I would say, you know,

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:47.060
just like the internet is big

01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:49.060
and there are lots of winners at all skill levels.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:51.700
I mean, there are half a dozen giant companies

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:53.500
that the internet has made,

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.100
but they're a bunch of medium-sized companies

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.980
and a bunch of small companies, all successful,

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:00.380
all with profit streams,

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.740
all driving great customer experiences.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:06.180
That's what we wanna see in space,

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.780
that kind of dynamism.

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.140
And space is big.

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.500
There's room for a bunch of winners

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.500
and it's gonna happen at all skill levels.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:17.620
And so, you know, SpaceX is gonna be successful for sure.

01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.220
I want Blue Origin to be successful

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.380
and I hope there are another, you know,

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.460
five companies right behind us.

01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:28.780
But, you know, I spoke to Elon a few times recently

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.780
about you, about Blue Origin,

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.420
and he was very positive about you as a person

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.660
and very supportive of all the efforts

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.220
you've been leading at Blue.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:38.120
What's your thoughts?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:42.360
You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon, at Blue.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.600
What's your thoughts about Elon

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.360
as a human being and a leader?

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.880
Well, I don't really know Elon very well.

01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:53.040
You know, I know his public persona,

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:55.800
but I also know you can't know anyone

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.960
by their public persona.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.120
It's impossible.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.120
I mean, you may think you do, but I guarantee you don't.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.920
So I don't really know, you know Elon way better

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:04.760
than I do, Lex.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.760
But in terms of his judging by the results,

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.800
he must be a very capable leader.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:18.440
There's no way you could have, you know, Tesla and SpaceX

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.880
without being a capable leader.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.940
It's impossible.

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.840
Yeah, I just, I hope you guys hang out sometimes,

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.160
shake hands and sort of have a kind of friendship

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.520
that would inspire just the entirety of humanity.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:37.520
Because what you're doing is like one of the big grand

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:40.360
challenges ahead for humanity.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:41.400
Well, I agree with you.

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.200
And I think in a lot of these endeavors,

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.520
we're very like-minded.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:46.360
Yeah.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:50.120
So I think, you know, I'm not saying we're identical,

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.860
but I think we're very like-minded.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:56.120
And so I, you know, I love that idea.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.240
All right, going back to sexy pictures on your Instagram,

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.760
there's a video of you from the early days of Amazon,

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.520
giving a tour of your quote, sort of offices.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.960
I think your dad is holding the camera.

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.160
He is, yeah, I know right, yes.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.880
This is what the giant orange extension cord, yeah.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:15.040
And you're like explaining the genius

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.960
of the extension cord and how this is a desk

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.880
and the CRT monitor and sort of that's where the,

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.240
that's where all the magic happened.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.200
I forget what your dad said,

01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.220
but this is like the center of it all.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:29.460
So what was it like?

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.140
What was going through your mind at that time?

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:36.140
You left a good job in New York and took this leap.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.200
Were you excited?

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.040
Were you scared?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.580
So excited and scared, anxious, you know,

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:44.300
thought the odds of success were low,

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.340
told all of our early investors

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.140
that I thought there was a 30% chance of success.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:50.780
By which I just been getting your money back,

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.980
not like turning out what actually happened.

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.180
Because that's the truth.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:58.300
Every startup company is unlikely to work.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:03.100
It's helpful to be in reality about that,

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.140
but that doesn't mean you can't be optimistic.

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.780
So you kind of have to have this duality in your head.

01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:09.660
Like on the one hand, you're,

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:12.340
you know what the baseline statistics say

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.780
about startup companies and the other hand,

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.660
you have to ignore all of that

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.620
and just be 100% sure it's gonna work.

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.780
And you're doing both things at the same time.

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:24.480
You're holding that contradiction in your head.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:26.800
But it was so, so exciting.

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:30.240
I love, you know, every from 1994

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.560
when the company was founded to 1995

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:38.160
when we opened our doors, all the way until today,

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.560
I find Amazon so exciting.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.480
And that doesn't mean it's like full of pain,

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.680
full of problems, you know, it's like,

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.120
there's so many things that need to be resolved

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:52.320
and worked and made better and et cetera.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:55.480
But on balance, it's so fun.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.640
It's such a privilege.

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.920
It's been such a joy.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.040
I feel so grateful that I've been part of that journey.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.800
It's just been incredible.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.560
So in some sense, you don't want a single day of comfort.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.200
You've written about this many times.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.280
We'll talk about your writing,

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:14.640
which I would highly recommend people read

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.480
in just the letters to shareholders.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:21.680
So you wrote explaining the idea of day one thinking.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.080
I think you first wrote about it

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.920
in 97 letters to shareholders.

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.360
Then you also, in a way, wrote about,

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:33.440
sad to say, is your last letter to shareholders as CEO.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:37.480
And you said that day two is stasis,

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.360
followed by irrelevance,

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:43.960
followed by excruciating painful decline,

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:45.840
followed by death.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.800
And that is why it's always day one.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.520
Can you explain this day one thing?

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.760
This is a really powerful way to describe

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.120
the beginning and the journey of Amazon.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:00.040
It's really a very simple,

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:05.040
and I think age old idea about renewal and rebirth.

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:08.520
And every day is day one.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:12.400
Every day you're deciding what you're gonna do.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.280
And you are not trapped by what you were

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:20.760
or who you were or any self-consistency.

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:24.000
Self-consistency even can be a trap.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:27.760
And so day one thinking is kind of,

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.320
we start fresh every day

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.840
and we get to make new decisions every day

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.040
about invention, about customers,

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:40.760
about how we're going to operate.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.520
Even as deeply as what our principles are,

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.600
we can go back to that.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.360
It turns out we don't change those very often,

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360
but we change them occasionally.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:54.360
And when we work on programs at Amazon,

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.880
we often make a list of tenets.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:03.080
And the tenets are kind of, they're not principles,

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:05.320
they're a little more tactical than principles,

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:08.680
but it's kind of the main ideas

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.480
that we want this program to embody, whatever those are.

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.400
And one of the things that we do is we put,

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.800
these are the tenets for this program in parentheses,

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.320
we always put, unless you know a better way.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:27.320
And that idea, unless you know a better way,

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.800
is so important because you never want

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.120
to get trapped by dogma.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:35.440
You never wanna get trapped by history.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.760
It doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:42.400
There's so much value in what has worked in the past.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:46.360
But you can't be blindly following what you've done.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.640
And that's the heart of day one,

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:51.120
is you're always starting fresh.

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:53.880
And to the question of how to fend off day two,

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:57.200
you said, such a question can't have a simple answer,

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200
as you're saying.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.320
There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.000
I don't know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.200
Here's a starter pack of essentials.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.360
Maybe others come to mind.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.680
For day one, defense.

01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.280
Customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies,

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.040
the eager adoption of external trends,

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.360
and high-velocity decision-making.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.120
So we talked about high-velocity decision-making.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.760
That's more difficult than it sounds.

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.760
So maybe you can pick one that stands out to you,

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.960
as you can comment on.

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.000
Eager adoption of external trends,

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.720
high-velocity decision-making, skeptical view of proxies.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.640
How do you fight off day two?

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.240
Well, you know, I'll talk about,

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.840
because I think it's the one that is maybe in some ways

01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:46.840
the hardest to understand is the skeptical view of proxies.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.720
One of the things that happens in business,

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.640
probably anything that you're,

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:57.600
where you have an ongoing program

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.600
and something is underway for a number of years,

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.720
is you develop certain things that you're managing to.

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.040
Like, let's say, the typical case would be a metric.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.920
And that metric isn't the real underlying thing.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.920
And so, you know, maybe the metric is efficiency metric

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.400
around customer contacts per unit sold or something like,

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:24.960
if you sell a million units,

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.760
how many customer contacts do you get?

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.360
Or how many returns do you get?

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:29.800
And so on and so on.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:33.360
And so what happens is a little bit of a kind of inertia

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.200
that sets in where somebody a long time ago

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.280
invented that metric.

01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.320
And they invented that metric.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:44.760
They decided we need to watch for, you know,

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:49.760
customer returns per unit sold as an important metric.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.440
But they had a reason why they chose that metric,

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.280
the person who invented that metric

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.680
and decided it was worth watching.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:59.320
And then fast forward five years,

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.680
that metric is the proxy.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.920
The proxy for truth, I guess.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.760
The proxy for truth, the proxy for customer,

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.720
let's say in this case, it's a proxy for customer happiness.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.800
But that metric is not actually customer happiness.

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:15.600
It's a proxy for customer happiness.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.720
The person who invented the metric

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.240
understood that connection.

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.240
Five years later, a kind of inertia can set in

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:30.400
and you forget the truth behind why you were watching

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.080
that metric in the first place.

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.640
And the world shifts a little.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.120
And now that proxy isn't as valuable as it used to be

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.680
or it's missing something.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.480
And you have to be on alert for that.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:44.360
You have to know, okay, this is,

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.760
I don't really care about this metric.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.520
I care about customer happiness.

01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:54.520
And this metric is worth putting energy into

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:58.360
and following and improving and scrutinizing

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:03.240
only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.040
And so you've got to constantly be on guard.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.840
And it's very, very common.

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:09.160
This is a nuanced problem.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.640
It's very common, especially in large companies,

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.840
that they are managing to metrics

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.000
that they don't really understand.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.320
They don't really know why they exist.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.240
And the world may have shifted out from under them a little

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.440
and the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.360
when somebody 10 years earlier invented the metric.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.560
That is a nuance, but that's a big problem, right?

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:37.240
There's something so compelling to have a nice metric

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.600
to try to optimize.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.440
Yes.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.000
And by the way, you do need metrics.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.840
Yes, you do.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.560
You can't ignore them.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:48.000
You want them, but you just have to be constantly on guard.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
This is a way to slip into day two thinking

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.760
would be to manage your business to metrics

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.840
that you don't really understand.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:58.640
And you're not really sure why they were invented

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.760
in the first place.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.480
And you're not sure they're still as relevant

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.920
as they used to be.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.280
What does it take to be the guy or gal

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:09.920
who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated?

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.240
I guess, what does it take to have a culture

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:14.520
that enables that in the meeting?

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:16.080
Because that's a very uncomfortable thing

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.840
to bring up at a meeting.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.920
We all showed up here, it's a Friday.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:24.160
This is such, you have just asked a million dollar question.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:28.520
So this is, this is what you're,

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.400
if I generalize what you're asking,

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.960
you were talking in general about truth telling.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.120
Yeah.

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:40.120
And we humans are not really truth seeking animals.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.840
We are social animals.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.240
Yeah, we are.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.400
And take you back in time 10,000 years

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.960
and you're in a small village.

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.640
If you go along to get along, you can survive.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.360
You can procreate.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.040
If you're the village truth teller,

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:01.120
you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:05.280
Truths are often, they don't want to be heard

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:09.800
because important truths can be uncomfortable.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:11.080
They can be awkward.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.800
They can be exhausting.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:13.640
Impolite.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.480
Yes.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:15.300
And all that kind of stuff.

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.140
Challenging.

01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:17.640
They can make people defensive

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.680
even if that's not the intent.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.920
But any high performing organization,

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.720
whether it's a sports team, a business,

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.360
a political organization, an activist group,

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:29.240
I don't care what it is.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.480
Any high performing organization

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:36.640
has to have mechanisms and a culture

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.360
that supports truth telling.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.640
One of the things you have to do

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.200
is you have to talk about that.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:42.680
And you have to talk about the fact

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.440
that it takes energy to do that.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.640
And you have to talk to people.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.840
You have to remind people it's okay

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.120
that it's uncomfortable.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.160
You have to literally tell people

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:56.400
it's not what we're designed to do as humans.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.440
It's not really, it's kind of a side effect.

01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.960
You know, we can do that.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.560
But it's not how we survive.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.560
We mostly survive by being social animals

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:08.160
and being cordial and cooperative.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.160
And that's really important.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.840
And so there's a, you know,

01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:14.640
science is all about truth telling.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.840
It's actually a very formal mechanism

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:22.040
for trying to tell the truth.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.080
And even in science,

01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:27.880
you find that it's hard to tell the truth, right?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.440
Even, you know, you're supposed to have a hypothesis

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.840
and test it and find data

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.440
and reject the hypothesis and so on.

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.680
It's not easy.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:40.320
But even in science, there's like the senior scientists

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.560
and the junior scientists,

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.920
and then there's a hierarchy of humans

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.960
where the somehow seniority matters

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:49.920
in the scientific process, which it should not.

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:51.720
And that's true inside companies too.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.480
And so you wanna set up your culture

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.800
so that the most junior person

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:03.640
can overrule the most senior person if they have data.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:08.960
And that really is about trying to, you know,

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.520
there are little things you can do.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.600
So for example, in every meeting that I attend,

01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.440
I always speak last.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.320
And I know from experience that,

01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.760
you know, if I speak first,

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:28.320
even very strong-willed,

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.600
highly intelligent, high judgment participants

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.440
in that meeting will wonder,

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.960
well, if Jeff thinks that,

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.160
I came in this meeting thinking one thing,

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:44.520
but maybe I'm not right.

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.640
And so you can do little things

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:49.320
like if you're the most senior person in the room,

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:53.440
go last, but everybody else go first.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.160
In fact, ideally,

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.720
let's try to have the most junior person go first

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.120
and then try to go in order of seniority

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.640
so that you can hear everyone's opinion

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.760
in a kind of unfiltered way.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.920
Because we really do,

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.280
we actually literally change our opinions.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:14.440
If somebody who you really respect says something,

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.400
makes you change your mind a little.

01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:22.400
So you're saying implicitly or explicitly give permission

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:25.160
for people to have a strong opinion

01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.680
that as long as it's backed by data.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.480
Yes, and sometimes it can even,

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:32.640
by the way, a lot of our most powerful truths

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:34.480
turn out to be hunches.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.000
They turn out to be based on anecdotes.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.600
They're intuition-based.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.640
And sometimes you don't even have strong data,

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:44.320
but you may know the person well enough

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.800
to trust their judgment.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.640
You may feel yourself leaning in.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.960
It may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.080
And then you may be able to say,

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:56.720
you know, something about that feels right.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.760
Let's go collect some data on that.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:02.760
Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.160
But for now, let's not disregard it

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.680
because it feels right.

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:08.480
You can also fight inherent bias.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:10.200
There's an optimism bias.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.080
Like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.400
and one of them is happy and one of them is unhappy,

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.600
it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.320
that the happy interpretation is right.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:27.200
You may want to sort of compensate for that human bias

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.360
of looking for, you know, trying to find the silver lining

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:32.960
and say, look, that might be good,

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:36.560
but I'm gonna go with it's bad for now until we're sure.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:39.880
So speaking of happiness bias, data collection,

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.640
and anecdotes, you have to, how's that for a transition?

01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:48.640
You have to tell me the story of the call you made,

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.320
the customer service call you made to demonstrate a point

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:57.320
about wait times.

01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.920
Yeah, this is very early in the history of Amazon.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.920
And we were going over a weekly business review

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:05.800
and a set of documents.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.040
And I have a saying, which is when the data

01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:14.560
and the anecdotes disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.

01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.640
And it doesn't mean you just slavishly

01:34:17.640 --> 01:34:18.800
go follow the anecdotes then.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.560
It means you go examine the data.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:26.320
And it's usually not that the data is being miscollected.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.160
It's usually that you're not measuring the right thing.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.320
And so, you know, if you have a bunch of customers

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:36.480
complaining about something, and at the same time,

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.560
you know, your metrics look like

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.320
why they shouldn't be complaining.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.800
You should doubt the metrics.

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:48.800
And an early example of this was we had metrics

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.680
that showed that our customers were waiting,

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.320
I think less than, I don't know, 60 seconds

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:56.960
when they called a 1-800 number to get, you know,

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.120
phone customer service.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.720
The wait time was supposed to be less than 60 seconds.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:04.800
And, but we had a lot of complaints

01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:06.520
that it was longer than that.

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.360
And anecdotally, it seemed longer than that.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.200
Like, you know, I would call customer service myself.

01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.680
And so one day we're in a meeting

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:17.680
or going through the WBR and the weekly business review,

01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:20.400
and we get to this metric in the deck.

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.000
And the guy who leads customer service

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.160
is to fit in the metric.

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:27.000
And I said, okay, let's call.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.080
And I picked up the phone,

01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:34.880
and I dialed the 1-800 number and called customer service.

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.960
And we just waited in silence for a few-

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:40.160
What did it turn out to be?

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.480
Oh, it was really long.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.760
More than 10 minutes, I think.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.600
Oh, wow.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.320
I mean, it was many minutes.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.760
And so, you know, it dramatically made the point

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:50.360
that something was wrong with the data collection.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:51.960
We weren't measuring the right thing.

01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:54.160
And that, you know, set off a whole chain of events

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.840
where we started measuring it right.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.840
And that's an example, by the way, of truth-telling,

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.440
is like, that's an uncomfortable thing to do.

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:08.440
But you have to seek truth, even when it's uncomfortable,

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.800
and you have to get people's attention,

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.160
and they have to buy into it,

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.200
and they have to get energized around really fixing things.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.760
So that speaks to the obsession with the customer experience.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:23.480
So one of the defining aspects of your approach to Amazon

01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.080
is just being obsessed with making customers happy.

01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:29.640
I think companies sometimes say that,

01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.280
but Amazon is really obsessed with that.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:37.120
I think there's something really profound to that,

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.800
which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.480
Like the customer experience, the human being

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.560
that's using the product, that's enjoying the product.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.200
Like what they're, like the subtle little things

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.320
that make up their experience.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.920
Like how do you optimize those?

01:36:55.240 --> 01:37:00.240
This is another really good and kind of deep question

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:04.720
because there are big things

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.160
that are really important to manage,

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.080
and then there are small things internally into Amazon.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.520
We call them paper cuts.

01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:16.280
So we have, we're always working on the big things.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.720
Like if you ask me, and most of the energy

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.360
goes into the big things, as it should.

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.720
So, and you can identify the big things,

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.240
and I would encourage anybody,

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.120
if anybody listening to this is an entrepreneur,

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.800
that's a small business, whatever,

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.600
think about the things that are not going to change

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.600
over 10 years, and those are probably the big things.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.200
So like I know in our retail business at Amazon,

01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:44.800
10 years from now, customers are still gonna want

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:45.960
low prices.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.920
I know they're still gonna want fast delivery,

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.280
and I just know they're still gonna want big selection.

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.200
So it's impossible to imagine a scenario

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.480
where 10 years from now, I say,

01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:57.040
where a customer says, I love Amazon,

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:59.000
I just wish the prices were a little higher,

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
or I love Amazon, I just wish you delivered

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.480
a little more slowly.

01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:05.840
So when you identify the big things,

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.480
you can tell they're worth putting energy into

01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.920
because they're stable in time.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:14.400
Okay, but you're asking about something a little different,

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.920
which is in every customer experience,

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.600
there are those big things, and by the way,

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.880
it's astonishingly hard to focus even on just the big things.

01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:24.680
So even though they're obvious,

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:27.120
they're really hard to focus on.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.200
But in addition to that, there are all these little

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.960
tiny customer experience deficiencies,

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.720
and we call those paper cuts,

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.360
and we make long lists of them,

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:43.240
and then we have dedicated teams that go fix paper cuts

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:47.360
because the teams working on the big issues

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:49.960
never get to the paper cuts.

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.480
They never work their way down the list to get to,

01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.560
they're working on big things, as they should,

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.880
and as you want them to,

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.960
and so you need special teams

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.720
who are charged with fixing paper cuts.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.160
Where would you put on the paper cut spectrum

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:10.400
the buy now with one click button,

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:12.320
which is, I think, pretty genius.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:16.320
So to me, like, okay, my interaction with things

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.280
that I love on the internet,

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.920
there's things I do a lot.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:23.120
I may be representing a regular human.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.520
I would love for those things to be frictionless.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:27.560
For example, booking airline tickets,

01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:33.840
just saying, but it's buying a thing with one click,

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.640
making that experience frictionless, intuitive,

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.040
all aspects of that.

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:46.040
That just fundamentally makes my life better,

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.640
not just in terms of efficiency,

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.000
in terms of some kind of-

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Cognitive load.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.640
Yeah, cognitive load and inner peace and happiness.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.640
First of all, buying stuff is a pleasant experience.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:01.200
Having enough money to buy a thing

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:03.600
and then buying it is a pleasant experience,

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.640
and having pain around that is somehow just,

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:10.080
you're ruining a beautiful experience,

01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:15.000
and I guess all I'm saying, as a person who loves good ideas,

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.400
is that a paper cut, a solution to a paper cut?

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:18.520
Yes.

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:21.640
So that particular thing is probably a solution

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.240
to a number of paper cuts.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.680
So if you go back and look at our order pipeline

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.320
and how people shopped on Amazon,

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:30.400
before we invented one-click shopping,

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:32.680
there was more friction.

01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:36.040
There was a whole series of paper cuts,

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:40.560
and that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts.

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.240
And I think you're absolutely right, by the way,

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:48.560
when you come up with something like one-click shopping,

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.840
again, this is so ingrained in people now,

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:54.600
I'm impressed that you even notice it.

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.000
Every time I click the button,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.640
I just, this surge of happiness.

01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.800
This, there is, in the perfect invention,

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:06.600
for the perfect moment, in the perfect context,

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:07.840
there is real beauty.

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.880
Yeah.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.360
It is actual beauty, and it feels good,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.520
it's emotional, it's emotional for the inventor,

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:18.560
it's emotional for the team that builds it,

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:21.400
it's emotional for the customer, it's a big deal.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.560
And you can feel those things.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:25.720
But to keep coming up with that idea,

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:26.960
with those kinds of ideas,

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.040
I guess is the day one thinking effort.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.680
Yeah, and you need a big group of people

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:35.360
who feel that kind of satisfaction

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:37.120
with creating that kind of beauty.

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:41.680
There's a lot of books written about you.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.880
There's a book, Invent and Wander,

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.920
where Walter Isaacson does an intro,

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.720
and it's mostly collective writings of yours.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:49.680
I've read that.

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:52.560
I also recommend people check out the Founders podcast

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:56.800
that covers you a lot, and it does different analysis

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.960
of different business advice you've given over the years.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.440
I bring all that up because I saw that there,

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:07.640
I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.160
for short attention spans.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.840
And I forget how it was phrased,

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:15.240
but that when you were thinking about the Kindle,

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:20.240
that you're thinking about how technology changes us.

01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:26.520
We co-evolve with our tools.

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:30.920
So we invent new tools, and then our tools change us.

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.320
Which is fascinating to think about.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.680
It goes in a circle.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.640
And there's some aspect, even just inside business,

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.040
where you don't just make the customer happy,

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.640
but you also have to think about where is this going

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.520
to take humanity if you zoom out a bit?

01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.120
100%.

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:52.120
And you can feel in your brain, brains are plastic,

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.400
and you can feel your brain getting reprogrammed.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.320
I remember the first time this happened to me

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.720
was when Tetris first came on the scene.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:07.160
I'm sure you've had, anybody who's been a game player

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:10.400
has this experience where you close your eyes

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:12.040
to lay down to go to sleep,

01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:16.120
and you see all the little blocks moving,

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.520
and you're kind of rotating them in your mind,

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.120
and you can just tell as you walk around the world

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:25.920
that you have rewired your brain to play Tetris.

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:30.000
And, but that happens with everything.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.960
And so, one of the, I think,

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.040
we still have yet to see the full repercussions of this.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.560
I think one of the things that we've done online,

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.240
largely because of social media,

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.600
is we have trained our brains to be really good

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.440
at processing super short form content.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:55.160
And your podcast flies in the face of this.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:58.360
You do these long format things,

01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:02.960
and reading books is a long format thing.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.560
And we all do more of,

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:09.600
if something is convenient, we do more of it.

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.800
And so when you make tools,

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.800
we carry around in our pocket a phone.

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.200
And one of the things that phone does, for the most part,

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:23.160
is it is an attention shortening device.

01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.320
Because most of the things we do on our phone

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:27.680
shorten our attention spans.

01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:30.600
And I'm not even gonna say we know for sure that that's bad,

01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.800
but I do think it's happening.

01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:34.800
It's one of the ways we're co-evolving with that tool.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.560
But I think it's important to spend some of your time

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:41.600
and some of your life doing long attention span things.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.520
Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.040
in your own life of focus,

01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:50.760
of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time.

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.840
And that's certainly what books do.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:55.080
And that's certainly what that piece of technology does.

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.080
But I bring all that up to ask you

01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.920
about another piece of technology, AI,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000
that has the potential to have various trajectories

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.400
to have an impact on human civilization.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.480
How do you think AI will change us?

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.080
If you're talking about generative AI,

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.640
large language models, things like Chad GPT,

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:22.360
and it's soon successors.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.640
These are incredibly powerful technologies

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.960
to believe otherwise is to bury your head in the sand,

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.800
soon to be even more powerful.

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:46.000
It's interesting to me that large language models

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.000
in their current form are not inventions, they're discoveries.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.440
The telescope was an invention,

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.600
but looking through it at Jupiter,

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.440
knowing that it had moons was a discovery.

01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.640
My God, it has moons.

01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.080
And that's what Galileo did.

01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:13.440
And so this is closer on that spectrum of invention.

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:16.760
We know exactly what happens with a 787.

01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.280
It's an engineered object.

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:22.200
We designed it, we know how it behaves.

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.200
We don't want any surprises.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.680
Large language models are much more like discoveries.

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:31.560
We're constantly getting surprised by their capabilities.

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.480
They're not really engineered objects.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:39.600
Then you have this debate about

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.280
whether they're gonna be good for humanity

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.760
or bad for humanity.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.920
Even specialized AI can be very bad for humanity.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:55.800
I mean, it's just regular machine learning models

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:00.800
that can make certain weapons of war

01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:04.720
that could be incredibly destructive and very powerful.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.960
And they're not general AIs.

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:09.400
They're just, they could just be very smart weapons.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.320
And so we have to think about all of those things.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:20.200
I'm very optimistic about this.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.420
So even in the face of all this uncertainty,

01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:29.300
my own view is that these powerful tools

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:35.020
are much more likely to help us and save us even

01:47:35.020 --> 01:47:39.140
than they are to unbalance, hurt us and destroy us.

01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:41.660
I think we humans have a lot of ways of,

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:45.340
we can make ourselves go extinct.

01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:47.980
These things may help us not do that.

01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.940
So we may actually, they may actually save us.

01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:54.260
So the people who are overly concerned,

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:57.140
in my view, overly concerned, it's a valid debate.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:02.200
I think that they may be missing part of the equation,

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.740
which is how helpful they could be

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:05.960
in making sure we don't destroy ourselves.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:11.180
I don't know if you saw the movie Oppenheimer,

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:14.620
but to me, first of all, I loved the movie

01:48:14.620 --> 01:48:17.740
and I thought the best part of the movie

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:22.140
is this bureaucrat played by Robert Downey Jr.

01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:23.620
Who, some people have talked to you

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.860
saying that's the most boring part of the movie.

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:28.080
I thought it was the most fascinating

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.300
because what's going on here is you realize

01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:36.380
we have invented these awesome, destructive,

01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:40.540
powerful technologies called nuclear weapons

01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:45.540
and they are managed and we humans are,

01:48:47.860 --> 01:48:51.660
we're not really capable of wielding those weapons.

01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.980
That's what he represented in that movie is

01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.980
here's this guy who is just, he wrongly thinks,

01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:05.100
he's like being so petty, he thinks that he said something,

01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:08.260
Oppenheimer said something bad to Einstein about him.

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.700
They didn't talk about him at all

01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:12.260
as you find out in the final scene of the movie.

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:16.540
And yet he spent his career trying to be vengeful

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:21.340
and petty and that's the problem.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:26.340
We as a species are not really sophisticated enough

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.420
and mature enough to handle these technologies.

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:36.100
And so, and by the way, before you get to general AI

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.940
and the possibility of AI having agency

01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:40.460
and there's a lot of things that have to happen,

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:43.660
but there's so much benefit that's gonna come

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.280
from these technologies in the meantime,

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:49.360
even before their, you know, general AI

01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:52.840
in terms of better medicines and better tools

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:54.840
to develop more technologies and so on.

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.840
So I think it's an incredible moment to be alive

01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:02.880
and to witness the transformations that are gonna happen,

01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.380
how quickly it'll happen, no one knows,

01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.240
but over the next 10 years and 20 years,

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.640
I think we're gonna see really remarkable advances

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:12.640
and I personally am very excited about it.

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.960
First of all, really interesting to say that it's discoveries

01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:19.960
that it's true that we don't know the limits

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:24.120
of what's possible with the current language models.

01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:24.960
We don't.

01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.400
And like, it could be a few tricks and hacks here and there

01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.360
that open doors to hold entire new possibilities.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.960
We do know that humans are doing something different

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:42.600
from these models in part because, you know,

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.600
we're so power efficient.

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.120
You know, the human brain does remarkable things

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:51.980
and it does it on about 20 watts of power.

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:55.780
And, you know, the AI techniques we use today

01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:59.180
use many kilowatts of power to do equivalent tasks.

01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.400
So there's something interesting

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:02.600
about the way the human brain does this.

01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.560
And also we don't need as much data.

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.080
So, you know, like self-driving cars are,

01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.440
they have to drive billions and billions of miles

01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:12.640
to try and to learn how to drive.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.240
And, you know, your average 16 year old figures it out

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.120
with many fewer miles.

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.760
So there are still some tricks

01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.920
I think that we have yet to learn.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.680
I don't think we've learned the last trick.

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:28.700
I don't think it's just a question of scaling things up.

01:51:30.160 --> 01:51:33.200
But what's interesting is that just scaling things up,

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.600
and I put just in quotes

01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:36.180
because it's actually hard to scale things up,

01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:37.920
but just scaling things up

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.360
also appears to pay huge dividends.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:43.000
Yeah, and there's some more nuanced aspects

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.840
about human beings that's interesting

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.760
if it's able to accomplish like being truly original

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.440
and novel to, you know, large language models

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:55.000
being able to come up with some truly new ideas.

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:56.860
That's one.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:59.800
And the other one is truth.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.680
It seems that large language models

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:06.680
are very good at sounding like they're saying a true thing,

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:11.400
but they don't require or often have a grounding

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:14.040
in sort of a mathematical truth.

01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:17.120
It just basically is a very good bullshitter.

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.120
So if there's not enough data in the training data

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.520
about a particular topic,

01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:30.360
it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.120
which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve.

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:37.080
How do you get language models

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:41.920
to infer what is true and not to sort of introspect?

01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.600
Yeah, they need to be taught to say,

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.160
I don't know more often.

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:48.720
And I know of several humans

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:50.080
who could be taught that as well.

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.580
Sure.

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.440
And then the other stuff,

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.080
because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.760
with the AI things, the other open question

01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:01.160
is what kind of products are created from this?

01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:02.240
Oh, so many.

01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.080
Yeah.

01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.080
I mean, just to, we have Alexa and Echo

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.680
and Alexa has hundreds of millions of installed base inputs.

01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.840
And so there's Alexa everywhere.

01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.960
And guess what?

01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.920
Alexa is about to get a lot smarter.

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:21.760
Yeah.

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.240
And so that's really, from a product point of view,

01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.080
that's super exciting.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.800
There's so many opportunities there.

01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:32.200
So many opportunities, shopping assistant,

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:33.680
all that stuff is amazing.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:36.840
In AWS, we're building Titan,

01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.600
which is our foundational model.

01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:41.600
We're also building Bedrock,

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:46.600
which our corporate clients at AWS, our enterprise clients,

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:49.440
they want to be able to use these powerful models

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.680
with their own corporate data

01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:55.800
without accidentally contributing their corporate data

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:57.360
to that model.

01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.120
And so those are the tools we're building for them

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.200
with Bedrock.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:02.800
And so there's tremendous opportunity here.

01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:04.000
Yeah, the security, the privacy,

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.680
all those things are fascinating of how to,

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:08.000
because so much value can be gained

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.800
by training on private data,

01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:11.120
but you want to keep this secure.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:13.520
That's a fascinating technical problem.

01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:15.840
This is a very challenging technical problem

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.280
and it's one that we're making progress on

01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.600
and dedicated to solving for our customers.

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.680
Do you think there will be a day when humans and robots,

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.360
maybe Alexa, have a romantic relationship?

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.160
Like in the movie Heart?

01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:31.200
Well, I mean, I think if you look at the-

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.240
Brainstorming products here.

01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.560
If you look at the spectrum of human variety

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:39.000
and what people like, sexual variety,

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:40.800
there are people who like everything.

01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:43.160
So the answer to your question has to be yes.

01:54:43.160 --> 01:54:44.000
Okay.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:44.840
I don't know how- I guess I'm asking when.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:46.840
I don't know how widespread that will be.

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:47.960
All right.

01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.200
But it will happen.

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.400
I was just asking when for a friend, but it's all right.

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:54.080
I was just moving on.

01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.400
Next question.

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.440
What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Bezos?

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:03.840
You're one of the most productive humans in the world.

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.520
Well, first of all, I get up in the morning and I putter.

01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.800
I like have a coffee.

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:10.920
Can you define putter?

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.440
Just like I slowly move around.

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.880
I'm not as productive as you might think I am.

01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.480
I mean, because I do believe in wandering

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:23.400
and I sort of, you know, I read my phone for a while.

01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.800
I read newspapers for a while.

01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:30.800
I chat with Laura and I drink my first coffee.

01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:33.080
So I kind of, I move pretty slowly

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:34.000
in the first couple of hours.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.960
I get up early, just naturally.

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.960
And then, you know, I exercise most days

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.240
and most days it's not that hard for me.

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.480
Some days it's really hard and I do it anyway.

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:48.880
I don't want to, you know, and it's painful.

01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.200
And I'm like, why am I here?

01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:52.120
And I don't want to do that.

01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.240
Why am I here at the gym?

01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.400
Why am I here at the gym?

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:55.800
Why don't I do something else?

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.680
You know, it's not always easy.

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.360
What's your source of motivation in those moments?

01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:05.840
I know that I'll feel better later if I do it.

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.880
And so like the real source of motivation,

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:11.320
I can tell the days when I skip it.

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:13.000
I'm not quite as alert.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.840
I don't feel as good.

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.280
And then there's harder motivations.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.200
It's longer term.

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.080
You want to be healthy as you age.

01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.360
You know, you want health span.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.680
You want, ideally, you know, you want to be healthy

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.560
and moving around when you're 80 years old.

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:29.760
You know, and so there's a lot of,

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.160
but that kind of motivation is so far in the future.

01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.800
It can be very hard to work in the second.

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.800
So thinking about the fact I'll feel better

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.920
in about four hours if I do it now.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:41.640
I'll have more energy for the rest of my day

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.760
and so on and so on.

01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.160
What's your exercise routine just to linger on that?

01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:46.520
What do you, how much you curl?

01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:47.960
I mean, what are we talking about here?

01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:50.920
That's all I do at the gym.

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:51.760
So I just.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.720
My routine, you know, on a good day,

01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:58.520
I do about half an hour of cardio

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.440
and I do about 45 minutes of weightlifting,

01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:04.520
resistance training of some kind, mostly weights.

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.320
I have a trainer who, you know, I love,

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:11.400
who pushes me, which is really helpful.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:14.160
You know, I'll be like, he'll say,

01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:17.040
uh, Jeff, do you think you could,

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.760
can we go up on that weight a little bit

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:21.320
and I'll think about it and I'll be like,

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.560
no, I don't think so.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.880
And he'll be, he'll look at me and say,

01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:27.320
yeah, I think you can.

01:57:27.320 --> 01:57:32.040
And of course he's right.

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.880
So it's helpful to have somebody push you a little bit.

01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:36.840
But almost every day you do that.

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:38.400
I do almost every day.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:40.640
I do a little bit of cardio

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:42.600
and a little bit of weightlifting

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:44.960
and I'd rotate, I'd do a pulling day

01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.440
and a pushing day and a leg day.

01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:48.200
It's all pretty standard stuff.

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:49.880
So puttering, coffee, gym.

01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:52.200
Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work.

01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.040
Work.

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.440
What's work look like?

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:58.360
What are the productive hours look like for you?

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.840
I, you know, so I, a couple of years ago,

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:03.280
I left as the CEO of Amazon

01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.560
and I have never worked harder in my life.

01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.240
I am working so hard and I'm mostly enjoying it,

01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:14.720
but there are also some very painful days.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:18.880
Most of my time is spent on Blue Origin

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.480
and I've been, I'm so deeply involved here now

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.600
for the last couple of years.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:24.200
And in the big, I love it.

01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:26.320
In the small, there's all the frustrations

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:27.680
that come along with everything.

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:29.760
You know, we're trying to get to rate manufacturing

01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:31.880
as we talked about, that's super important.

01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:32.760
We'll get there.

01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.040
We just hired a new CEO,

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:36.840
a guy I've known for close to 15 years now,

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:39.680
a guy named Dave Lemp, who I love, he's amazing.

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:43.760
You know, so we're super lucky to have Dave

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:46.440
and you're gonna see us move faster there.

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:51.400
But so my day of work, you know, reading documents,

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.040
having meetings, sometimes in person,

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:56.840
sometimes over Zoom, depends on where I am.

01:58:56.840 --> 01:58:59.520
It's all about, you know, the technology.

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.000
It's about the organization.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.680
It's about, you know, I'm very,

01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:08.720
I have architecture and technology meetings

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:12.040
almost every day on various subsystems

01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:14.840
inside the vehicle, inside the engines.

01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:16.200
It's super fun for me.

01:59:16.200 --> 01:59:18.640
My favorite part of it is the technology.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:22.200
My least favorite part of it is, you know,

01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.000
building organizations and so on.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.640
That's important, but it's also my least favorite part.

01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.440
So, you know, that's why they call it work.

01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.640
You don't always get to do what you wanna do.

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:34.160
How do you achieve time where you can focus

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:36.200
and truly think through problems?

01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:38.920
I do little thinking retreats.

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:42.520
So this is not the only, I can do that all day long.

01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:44.080
I'm very good at focusing.

01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:47.640
I'm very good at, you know,

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:50.000
I don't keep to a strict schedule.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.400
Like my meetings often go longer than I planned for them to

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:56.040
because I believe in wandering.

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:59.400
My perfect meeting starts with a crisp document.

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:01.960
So the document should be written with such clarity

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.960
that it's like angels singing from on high.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.200
I like a crisp document and a messy meeting.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:12.560
And so the meeting is about like asking questions

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:14.320
that nobody knows the answer to

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:19.320
and trying to like wander your way to a solution.

02:00:20.400 --> 02:00:25.400
And that is, when that happens just right,

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.120
it makes all the other meetings worthwhile.

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:29.960
It feels good.

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:31.800
It has a kind of beauty to it.

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.200
It has an aesthetic beauty to it.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.240
And you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that.

02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:39.400
Can you actually describe the crisp document?

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.760
Like this is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:44.880
of the way you approach meetings.

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.720
This is the six page memo.

02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.520
Maybe first describe the process

02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:51.520
of running a meeting with memos.

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.480
Meetings at Amazon and Blue Origin are unusual.

02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:58.920
When we get new, when new people come in

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.760
like a new executive joins,

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:02.760
they're a little taken aback sometimes

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:05.520
because a typical meeting will start

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.960
with a six page narratively structured memo.

02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:11.640
And we do study hall.

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:14.840
For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.400
in the meeting and read, take notes in the margins.

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.320
And then we discuss.

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.800
And the reason, by the way, we do study,

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.560
you could say, I would like everybody

02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:28.960
to read these memos in advance,

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.440
but the problem is people don't have time to do that.

02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:33.800
And they end up coming to the meeting

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:35.600
having only skimmed the memo

02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.040
or maybe not read it at all.

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.600
And they're trying to catch up.

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:40.560
And they're also bluffing like they were in college

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:42.360
having pretended to do the reading.

02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.960
Yeah, exactly.

02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:46.720
It's better just to carve out the time for people.

02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:48.320
So now we're all on the same page.

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:50.160
We've all read the memo.

02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:53.120
And now we can have a really elevated discussion.

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.480
And this is so much better

02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:56.920
from having a slideshow presentation,

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.800
a PowerPoint presentation of some kind

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:01.720
where that has so many difficulties.

02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:03.360
But one of the problems is

02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.840
PowerPoint is really designed to persuade.

02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.760
It's kind of a sales tool.

02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:11.400
And internally, the last thing you wanna do is sell.

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.400
You wanna, again, you're truth seeking.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.200
You're trying to find truth.

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.200
And the other problem with PowerPoint

02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:21.880
is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience.

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.040
And a memo is the opposite.

02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:25.760
It's hard to write a six page memo.

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.680
A good six page memo might take two weeks to write.

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:30.360
You have to write it, you have to rewrite it,

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.640
you have to edit it, you have to talk to people about it.

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.960
They have to poke holes in it for you.

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.360
You write it again.

02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:37.640
It might take two weeks.

02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.400
So the author, it's really a very difficult job.

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:45.160
But for the audience, it's much better.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:47.600
So you can read a half hour and, you know,

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:50.120
there are little problems with PowerPoint presentations too.

02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:52.480
You know, senior executives interrupt with questions

02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:54.360
halfway through the presentation.

02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.400
That question's gonna be answered on the next slide,

02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.920
but you never got there.

02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:00.760
If you read the whole memo in advance,

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.880
I often write lots of questions that I have

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.280
in the margins of these memos.

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.760
And then I go cross them all out

02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:08.680
because by the time I get to the end of the memo,

02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.720
they've been answered.

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.880
That's why I save all that time.

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.520
You also get, you know,

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:15.440
if the person who's preparing the memo,

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:20.280
we talked earlier about group think

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.840
and the fact that I go last in meetings

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.600
and that you don't want your ideas

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.920
to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely.

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.320
You know, the author of the memos

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:35.040
has kind of got to be very vulnerable.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.600
They've got to put all their thoughts out there

02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:39.320
and they've got to go first.

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:42.920
But that's great because it makes them really good.

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:45.400
And so, and you get to see their real ideas

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.480
and you're not tromping on them accidentally

02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:49.840
in a big, you know, PowerPoint presentation.

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:52.040
What's that feel like when you've authored a thing

02:03:52.040 --> 02:03:53.240
and then you're sitting there

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:55.160
and everybody's reading your thing?

02:03:55.800 --> 02:03:57.640
I think it's mostly terrifying.

02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.480
Yeah.

02:04:00.480 --> 02:04:02.160
Like maybe in a good way?

02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:03.000
I think it's-

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:03.840
Like a purifying-

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:07.160
I think it's terrifying in a productive way.

02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:08.000
Yeah.

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:13.120
But I think it's mostly a very nerve-racking experience.

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:16.280
Is there a art science to the writing

02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.000
of the six page memo

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.240
or just writing in general to you?

02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:23.360
I mean, it's really got to be a real memo.

02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.920
So it means, you know, paragraphs have topics, sentences,

02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:30.160
it's verbs and nouns.

02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:31.440
That's the other problem with PowerPoint

02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.680
is they're often just bullet points.

02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:36.800
And you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:37.840
behind bullet points.

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.800
When you have to write in complete sentences

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.160
with narrative structure,

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:43.560
it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking.

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:48.320
So it does, it forces the author to be at their best.

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.160
And so you're getting somebody's,

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.240
they're getting somebody's really their best thinking.

02:04:54.120 --> 02:04:55.400
And then you don't have to spend a lot of time

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:58.720
trying to tease that thinking out of the person.

02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:00.280
And you've got it from the very beginning.

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.280
So it really saves you time in the long run.

02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:06.120
So that part is crisp and then the rest is messy.

02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:06.960
Crisp document.

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:09.040
Yes, and you don't want to pretend

02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:11.680
that the discussion should be crisp.

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:13.040
There's, you know, most meetings

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:15.960
you're trying to solve a really hard problem.

02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:16.960
There's a different kind of meeting,

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:19.800
which we call weekly business reviews or business reviews.

02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:22.440
They may be weekly or monthly or daily, whatever they are.

02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:24.520
But these business review meetings,

02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:27.120
that's usually for incremental improvement.

02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.160
And you're looking at a series of metrics

02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:30.760
every time it's the same metrics.

02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:32.560
Those meetings can be very efficient.

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.040
They can start on time and end on time.

02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.200
So we're about to run out of time,

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:41.760
which is a good time to ask about the 10,000 year clock.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:46.760
That's what I'm known for is the humor.

02:05:47.840 --> 02:05:51.880
Okay, can you explain what the 10,000 year clock is?

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:56.160
10,000 year clock is a physical clock of monumental scale.

02:05:56.160 --> 02:05:57.800
It's about 500 feet tall.

02:05:57.800 --> 02:06:00.240
It's inside a mountain in West Texas

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.040
in a chamber that's about 12 feet in diameter

02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:04.840
and 500 feet tall.

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:07.760
10,000 year clock is an idea conceived

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:11.520
by a brilliant guy named Danny Hillis way back in the 80s.

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:14.880
The idea is to build a clock

02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:17.600
as a symbol for long-term thinking.

02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:20.440
And you can kind of just very conceptually think

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:25.440
of the 10,000 year clock as it ticks once a year,

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:30.280
it chimes once every 100 years

02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:33.040
and the cuckoo comes out once every thousand years.

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:36.360
So it just sort of slows everything down.

02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:40.400
And it's a completely mechanical clock.

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:43.240
It is designed to last 10,000 years

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.200
with no human intervention.

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.920
So the material choices and everything else,

02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.520
it's in a remote location both to protect it,

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:56.520
but also so that visitors have to kind of make a pilgrimage.

02:06:57.040 --> 02:07:00.400
The idea is that over time,

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:02.680
this will take hundreds of years,

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:06.600
but over time it will take on the patina of age

02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.080
and then it will become a symbol for long-term thinking

02:07:10.080 --> 02:07:13.720
that will actually hopefully get humans

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:18.360
to extend their thinking horizons.

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:21.960
And in my view, that's really important

02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:24.840
as we have become as a species,

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:26.880
as a civilization more powerful.

02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:28.600
We're really affecting the planet now.

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:30.440
We're really affecting each other.

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.840
We have weapons of mass destruction.

02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:35.560
We have all kinds of things

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.760
where we can really hurt ourselves.

02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:40.640
And the problems we create can be so large,

02:07:41.480 --> 02:07:44.840
the unintended consequences of some of our actions.

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.480
Climate change, putting carbon in the atmosphere

02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.400
is a perfect example.

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.000
That's an unintended consequence of the Industrial Revolution.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.120
Got a lot of benefits from it,

02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.560
but we've also got this side effect

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.600
that is very detrimental.

02:07:56.600 --> 02:07:59.160
We need to be, we need to start training ourselves

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:00.240
to think longer term.

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.160
Long-term thinking is a giant lever.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:06.080
You can literally solve problems if you think long-term

02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:09.040
that are impossible to solve if you think short-term.

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:11.560
And we aren't really good at thinking long-term

02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:14.800
as it's not really, we're kind of,

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:18.120
five years is a tough timeframe

02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:21.320
for most institutions to think past.

02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:25.000
And we probably need to stretch that to 10 years

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.360
and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.520
And we'd do a better job for our children

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.840
or our grandchildren if we could stretch

02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:33.240
those thinking horizons.

02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:37.640
And so the clock is in a way, it's an art project.

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:43.640
It's a symbol and if it ever has any power

02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:46.040
to influence people to think longer term,

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.600
that won't happen for hundreds of years,

02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:49.360
but we have to, we're gonna build it now

02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:52.200
and let it accrue the patina of age.

02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:55.120
Do you think humans will be here when the clock runs out,

02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:56.520
here on earth?

02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:57.400
I think so.

02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:02.120
But the United States won't exist.

02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:03.800
Whole civilizations rise and fall.

02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.800
10,000 years is so long.

02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:10.080
Like no nation state has ever survived

02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.760
for anywhere close to 10,000 years.

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:15.120
And the increasing rate of progress makes that even.

02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:15.960
Even less likely.

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.320
So do I think humans will be here?

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:20.840
Yes, how will we have changed ourselves

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:23.360
and what will we be and so on and so on?

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:25.640
I don't know, but I think we'll be here.

02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.480
On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny.

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:31.080
Do you ponder your own mortality?

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:32.520
Are you afraid of death?

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:36.880
No, you know, I used to be afraid of death.

02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:40.520
I did, like I remember as a young person

02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:44.920
being kind of like very scared of mortality.

02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:47.080
Like didn't want to think about it and so on

02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:49.960
and always had a big, and as I've gotten older,

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:52.960
I'm 59 now, as I've gotten older,

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.200
somehow that fear has sort of gone away.

02:09:56.200 --> 02:10:00.800
I don't, you know, I would like to stay alive

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:01.840
for as long as possible,

02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.880
but I'd like to be, I'm really more focused

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:05.360
on health span.

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.800
I want to be healthy.

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:08.120
I want that square wave.

02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:12.160
I want to be healthy, healthy, healthy, and then gone.

02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:13.760
I don't want the long decay.

02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:18.880
But, and I'm curious, I want to see how things turn out.

02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:19.980
You know, I'd like to be here.

02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:22.840
I love my family and my close friends

02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.000
and I'm curious about them and I want to see.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.240
So I have a lot of reasons to stay around,

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:33.240
but it's, mortality doesn't have that effect on me

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.160
that it did, you know, maybe when I was in my twenties.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Well, Jeff, thank you for creating Amazon,

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.120
one of the most incredible companies in history

02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:46.160
and thank you for trying your best to make humans

02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:48.840
and multi-planetary species expanding out

02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.880
into our solar system, maybe beyond

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:53.800
to meet the aliens out there.
