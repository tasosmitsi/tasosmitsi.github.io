00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
The following is a conversation with Mark Normand,

00:02.700 --> 00:05.320
a New York comedian who has a way with words

00:05.320 --> 00:08.400
that is often both dark and hilarious.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
Let there be a warning, dear friends,

00:10.400 --> 00:13.540
to proceed with caution and to wear protection.

00:13.540 --> 00:16.180
You may, in fact, need it.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.360
He has a special on his YouTube called Out to Lunch

00:19.360 --> 00:21.160
and a new special on Netflix

00:21.160 --> 00:23.880
as part of the standup season three series

00:23.880 --> 00:26.040
I recommend you watch.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.160
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.360
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:30.360 --> 00:33.760
in the description and now here's my conversation

00:33.760 --> 00:35.440
with Mark Normand.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.520
I asked him, Dylan, about Bukowski first,

00:38.520 --> 00:40.360
so let me continue on that tradition

00:40.360 --> 00:42.200
and ask you about something

00:42.200 --> 00:44.640
that Charles Bukowski said about love.

00:44.640 --> 00:46.120
Wait, are we rolling?

00:46.120 --> 00:46.960
Yes.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.480
Oh, geez, no hello, no nothing.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.320
Nope.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.160
I thought I was robotic.

00:50.160 --> 00:54.880
Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away

00:54.880 --> 00:57.200
with the first daylight of reality.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.600
So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.920
What are your thoughts about love?

01:02.920 --> 01:05.360
You talk about your relationships quite a bit.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.720
Do you think love can last?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.840
I do, but I think it's work.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.600
Everybody wants love to be this prepackaged,

01:13.600 --> 01:17.000
perfect, euphoric thing, but you gotta,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.240
it's like a good body, you know?

01:20.240 --> 01:21.700
We're all born with a good body,

01:21.700 --> 01:23.040
but you gotta keep it in shape

01:23.040 --> 01:25.920
and it's the same with a loving relationship.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.440
I think you...

01:27.440 --> 01:30.280
Nobody wants to do the work, that's the problem.

01:30.280 --> 01:32.520
You talked about, I think you told a story

01:32.520 --> 01:35.360
about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend

01:35.360 --> 01:36.760
or something like that.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.440
I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.320
Who were you talking to, Burt Crusher maybe

01:43.320 --> 01:44.160
or something like that?

01:44.160 --> 01:46.120
Oh, yeah, we were high school sweethearts,

01:46.120 --> 01:48.800
dated for like 12 years and then...

01:48.800 --> 01:50.120
So that wasn't love anymore.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.680
That was more like relationship, that was like...

01:51.680 --> 01:53.400
It was comfort, it was routine.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.000
And we just slipped into that kind of married life

01:56.000 --> 02:01.000
autopilot world and I tried to break up, I think,

02:01.640 --> 02:04.440
and it didn't take, was one of those things.

02:04.440 --> 02:09.440
Our lives are just so baked in and then I think I cheated

02:09.680 --> 02:11.680
and she caught me and it was ugly

02:11.680 --> 02:13.640
and then we went to therapy to try to work it out,

02:13.640 --> 02:16.480
but it's much like a car that gets into a wreck,

02:16.480 --> 02:18.800
the door just never closed the same.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.720
You know what I mean?

02:19.760 --> 02:23.520
Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment

02:23.520 --> 02:25.760
like outside of love marriage?

02:25.760 --> 02:27.520
I think it's an antiquated idea.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.720
I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.920
And I think we're coming out of that

02:31.920 --> 02:34.640
as we get all polyamorous and non-binary

02:34.640 --> 02:36.080
and queefy and all this stuff.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.720
I think we're slowly moving away from that,

02:38.720 --> 02:41.280
but I think a lot of the ladies,

02:41.280 --> 02:45.440
more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.680
Like I'm a fiance now or whatever you call it.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.800
Gaged.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.560
And I mean, she is just, woo wee, going hog wild.

02:54.560 --> 02:55.400
She's loving it.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.720
She's got the dress thing, pick a venue, flower,

02:57.720 --> 03:00.560
and she's deep in whereas I feel guilty

03:00.560 --> 03:03.160
because I'm just like, ah, geez.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.600
Is it planned already?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.440
What is the wedding?

03:06.440 --> 03:07.280
You see Squid Game?

03:07.280 --> 03:08.880
I'm just living life.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.560
Yeah, it's planned.

03:11.560 --> 03:12.400
It's in New Orleans.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.960
I'm from there and it's next year.

03:15.960 --> 03:16.840
Are you married?

03:16.840 --> 03:17.760
No, single.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.280
Virgin?

03:19.280 --> 03:20.120
Of course, yeah.

03:20.120 --> 03:20.960
I can't imagine.

03:20.960 --> 03:21.880
I bet you'd be great in bed.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.080
You're ripped.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.520
You have the best hairline in podcasting.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.360
Yeah, I don't know.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.760
I haven't tried yet, so we'll have to see.

03:27.760 --> 03:28.840
All right, well, let me know.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.840
Pretty big hog on you.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.840
Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.280
That matters to girls?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.320
Apparently, yeah, that's all I hear about.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.760
Okay, New Orleans, you grew up in New Orleans?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.280
Yeah, born and raised.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.640
Treme, outside the French Quarter.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.560
Yeah, don't remember it.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.680
Oh, you drink?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.520
Yeah, I drink.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.360
Of course, I drink.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.960
I don't know, I can't tell if you have fun.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.080
No, not really, but Russian, I mean,

03:57.080 --> 03:59.480
Russian, of course, I drink vodka, all that kind of stuff.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.280
Yeah, yeah, gotta know.

04:01.280 --> 04:02.120
Vodka.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.520
Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011.

04:05.520 --> 04:06.440
Fun fact.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.280
What do you mean?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.440
In Russia.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.880
It was just drinks, it was just like apple juice before.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.160
It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.240
Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.440
I guess so.

04:18.440 --> 04:19.960
See, that's where your brain goes.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.680
I just go, oh, these fucking Russkies are...

04:21.680 --> 04:24.120
I didn't even know there was rules about drinking.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.360
This is good, I'm learning about Russia from you.

04:26.360 --> 04:30.720
So what's the difficult memory, experience from childhood

04:30.720 --> 04:35.720
in New Orleans that made you the man you are today?

04:37.000 --> 04:40.560
I don't know if it made me the man, but geez,

04:41.480 --> 04:45.800
I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
I was the white kid in the neighborhood.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.960
So I was automatically the odd man out,

04:50.960 --> 04:54.800
the minority, the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.360
So just a lot of memories of getting slapped in the face

04:59.360 --> 05:01.280
by guys and just having to take it,

05:01.280 --> 05:02.760
because there's five guys there.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.840
And they'd be like, oh, look, you don't even fight back.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.200
And you're like, well, what am I gonna do?

05:06.200 --> 05:07.840
Hit you and then get beat up by these guys?

05:07.840 --> 05:12.160
So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up.

05:12.160 --> 05:16.040
Got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.400
Had a bicycle taken from under me, that was pretty brutal.

05:19.400 --> 05:24.400
These kids pulled up, they're like 17, and I was 13,

05:24.440 --> 05:27.080
and I had a face paint on.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.200
Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp

05:30.200 --> 05:32.440
and I had a rainbow face painted on me.

05:32.440 --> 05:34.040
We were helping kids that day.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.440
So I let them put paint on me.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.000
And so now I'm riding home.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.920
What a mark, what a goober I am.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.000
I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.880
I'm a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.960
He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek.

05:46.960 --> 05:50.680
So they just go, hey, cut in front of you.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.760
They go, let me try your bike.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.080
I go, I'm good, I'm good.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.440
I knew what they wanted.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.240
And they go, let me try the bike.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.400
And then they just pushed me and took the bike.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.160
So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity,

06:02.160 --> 06:03.960
the self-worth.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.400
They did, cause I've been mugged when I was younger too.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.400
Really?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.640
Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.480
For sure.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.800
You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean,

06:16.800 --> 06:18.960
this cool, inconsiderate.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.240
I'm always worried about it.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.400
Did I fart too much?

06:21.400 --> 06:22.240
Am I annoying?

06:22.240 --> 06:23.800
Am I pissing this guy off?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.560
But what a way to live.

06:25.560 --> 06:28.360
Just, I want the bike, I'm taking it.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.040
Fuck his feelings.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.600
For me, that quickly turned into realizing

06:34.240 --> 06:36.680
that that's just a temporary phase that those folks are in.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.040
Like they have a capacity to be good.

06:40.040 --> 06:40.880
Sure.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.880
For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see,

06:43.880 --> 06:47.560
can we discover, can we incentivize them

06:47.560 --> 06:49.560
to find like a better path in life?

06:49.560 --> 06:53.080
Like I wasn't like all like, I don't know, Gandhi about it.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.680
You know, of course I was pissed

06:54.680 --> 06:57.360
and all those kinds of things, but I don't know.

06:57.360 --> 07:01.680
It seemed like just the kind of thing

07:01.680 --> 07:03.440
you might do when you're younger.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.800
You hope, but this is adult crime, obviously.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.360
Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.120
And then it solidifies and then you're beyond saving

07:12.120 --> 07:14.880
at some point, but it's like, there's always,

07:14.880 --> 07:20.000
there's always an opportunity to make a better life

07:20.000 --> 07:22.960
for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.640
Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike

07:25.640 --> 07:29.640
and my mom, she's, my parents are like liberal to a fault.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.480
Yeah.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.880
You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.160
They're poor kids in the neighborhood and you're like,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.680
all right, but I also like I have a bicycle

07:36.680 --> 07:38.280
that I ride around, you know?

07:38.280 --> 07:40.920
And I also like to live in an area that's not just,

07:40.920 --> 07:43.720
you know, riddled with theft and vandalism,

07:43.720 --> 07:45.840
but they were just like, ah, they need it.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.160
And then it was a moot point, we just moved on.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.920
So I remember very young being like, all right,

07:49.920 --> 07:51.720
I gotta figure my shit out.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.560
Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit,

07:56.560 --> 07:57.640
like bullying and stuff?

07:57.640 --> 08:00.000
Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.400
but you know, you get a black eye here and there

08:02.400 --> 08:04.200
and a bloody nose, stuff like that.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.920
And it was just the outnumbered thing.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.160
The violence didn't really bother me

08:08.160 --> 08:10.280
because you're just kids, you're boys.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.120
But it was the predatory, let's get him.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.960
You know, we can take him down.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.880
He's, you know, he's an easy target.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.320
That's what kills you, the mental part.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.320
Yeah, you know, until you actually said it,

08:24.320 --> 08:26.840
I didn't realize, I've been in,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.320
what do you call them, scuffles.

08:29.320 --> 08:32.240
And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.640
Let's hear it, fatty, bring it on.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.000
And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.960
Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.080
You're like John Wick.

08:40.080 --> 08:41.720
All right.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.920
Well, I used to have, now you're gonna start making fun of me,

08:43.920 --> 08:46.320
I used to have long hair for like a couple years.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.600
I was in a band playing music and stuff like that.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.840
And there was, like most of the fights I've been in

08:51.840 --> 08:54.960
were basically one-on-one, maybe a little bit like,

08:54.960 --> 08:58.680
a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.960
And this one particular time, I've learned a lot of lessons,

09:02.960 --> 09:06.040
but one of them was, there was a fight started

09:06.040 --> 09:08.160
between me and this other person.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.360
And then his buddies, I guess, were there.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.000
And they, as opposed to like breaking it up

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.960
It's the first time anybody grabbed,

09:20.960 --> 09:22.920
like used my hair in a fight,

09:22.920 --> 09:24.800
which I've since then realized

09:24.800 --> 09:26.400
that that's actually a really powerful grip

09:26.400 --> 09:27.640
and a powerful weapon.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.160
Oh, very vulnerable of you.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.600
And then my head got pulled back

09:31.600 --> 09:32.680
and they pulled me down to the ground.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
Like I couldn't do anything.

09:33.680 --> 09:37.000
It was so, I remember being exceptionally frustrated.

09:37.000 --> 09:37.840
Yes.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.480
Like that was the feeling like, I can't do anything here.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.360
I'm like trapped.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.360
And then they were just like kicking me

09:44.360 --> 09:45.520
and hitting me and stuff like that.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.480
And the outnumbered part of it,

09:49.120 --> 09:51.480
because I always kind of remember the trapped part

09:51.480 --> 09:53.800
because I just hated from a fighting,

09:53.800 --> 09:57.080
grappling perspective, how like,

09:57.080 --> 09:58.720
the feeling was this isn't fair.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.960
Yes, that's what it is.

09:59.960 --> 10:04.200
It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.520
The mob wins.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.800
Yeah, the mob wins.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.920
Scary stuff.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.000
But it makes a man out of you in a weird way

10:10.000 --> 10:10.840
that builds character.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.360
You realize life isn't fair early

10:12.360 --> 10:14.720
and you go on from there.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.960
So there's something there.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.040
And look at you today.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.280
They're probably eating out of a dumpster

10:19.280 --> 10:21.120
at a Krispy Kreme and you're here,

10:21.120 --> 10:22.920
got eight podcasts.

10:22.920 --> 10:23.760
You're doing great.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.720
You're talking to giant titans of the industry.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.560
No, I do remember returning home that night.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.600
I mean, you said you were crying.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.200
That's really formative.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.480
Like, that's the point at which you get to decide

10:35.480 --> 10:37.120
what do I make of this moment?

10:37.120 --> 10:38.560
I mean, especially when you're younger,

10:38.560 --> 10:40.800
maybe it's not presented to you that way,

10:40.800 --> 10:43.560
but like some of the greatest people in history

10:44.520 --> 10:47.280
were bullied in these kinds of ways.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.000
And they made something of themselves in this moment.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.560
Like bullied by life in some kind of way.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.400
It's like an opportunity for growth.

10:53.400 --> 10:58.160
It's weird, but like hardship, even in small doses,

10:58.160 --> 11:00.080
is like an opportunity for growth.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.520
Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.600
They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time.

11:03.600 --> 11:04.720
Grew up in a whorehouse,

11:04.720 --> 11:07.200
watched his mom get plowed by these guys

11:07.200 --> 11:10.880
in the middle of Indiana, I want to say.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.680
And who had a harder life?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.040
He would suck dick for drugs,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.480
all this stuff growing up, beat up.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.320
And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry,

11:20.320 --> 11:22.360
that's my birth control alarm.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.440
And then the whole world is like trying

11:24.440 --> 11:27.080
to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying,

11:27.080 --> 11:28.680
but now it's accepted bullying.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.960
It's very strange.

11:29.960 --> 11:33.120
So you're a proponent of beating kids up?

11:33.120 --> 11:33.960
Is that what you're saying?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.560
Yes, and sex with them.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.840
All right.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.600
But no, I just think it's part of life

11:40.600 --> 11:42.440
and it's horrible, it's like rain.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.680
You gotta have it, look, a rainy day is a bummer,

11:44.680 --> 11:45.520
but you need it.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.840
And I think it's similar to that.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.120
What was your relationship like with your mom,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.880
and your dad, or what are some memorable moments with them?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.000
What did you learn from them?

11:56.000 --> 11:59.400
Good parents, they're giving, thoughtful,

12:01.760 --> 12:05.120
a little out to lunch, they were workaholics,

12:05.120 --> 12:08.600
so it was hard to get a lot out of them.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.520
And my dad was kind of an angry dad.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.320
I think he just had like a weird childhood

12:13.320 --> 12:14.440
and he's just trying to make it

12:14.440 --> 12:16.800
and he's trying to provide, but it's hard.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.800
And we live in this horrible neighborhood

12:18.800 --> 12:20.640
and we're getting robbed all the time.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.400
So life was kind of coming down on him all the time.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.880
So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.160
But great parents, they cared, they put us first,

12:32.080 --> 12:33.960
but there wasn't a lot of,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.240
I don't know, you ever go to a friend's house as a kid

12:37.240 --> 12:39.240
and there's like a picture of a ski trip

12:39.240 --> 12:40.760
and you're like, ski trip?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.640
What the hell is that about?

12:42.640 --> 12:46.520
It wasn't a lot of that and very smart people,

12:46.520 --> 12:49.680
but I don't know how well they were at socializing.

12:49.680 --> 12:53.040
So you never bonded with them on a deep human level?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.600
Some bonding, but rarely deep.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.320
Yeah, it was just almost co-worker.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.320
Hey, cold out, huh?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.160
What?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.280
It's cold out, huh?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.280
Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, gotcha.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.720
Get there a little bit, but it would,

13:05.720 --> 13:07.680
my parents are done, I hope they never hear this,

13:07.680 --> 13:09.200
but they would do a thing where,

13:09.200 --> 13:11.880
my dad especially would do a thing where he would,

13:11.880 --> 13:14.400
he knew how to cut you down, right to the bone.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.920
And so after a while you're like,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.200
I'm not even gonna interact with this guy

13:17.200 --> 13:20.000
because he can get you so well.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.320
One time we were at a Thanksgiving,

13:22.320 --> 13:25.520
some kind of family event and all the cousins are there

13:25.520 --> 13:26.880
and I remember I was holding court.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.280
I was a young boy finding my comedic legs

13:30.280 --> 13:33.720
in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family

13:33.720 --> 13:38.080
and I was killing and my dad comes up and he goes,

13:38.080 --> 13:39.640
what are you holding court?

13:39.640 --> 13:42.600
And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.160
I just, whoo, shrunk down.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.760
He just nailed it because in my head I'm like,

13:45.760 --> 13:47.720
I'm holding court, look at me, I got the whole room

13:47.720 --> 13:50.000
and he goes, what are you holding court here?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.560
And I'm like, who the hell do you think you are?

13:51.560 --> 13:54.040
And I was like, he's right, I shouldn't be holding court,

13:54.040 --> 13:54.880
who the fuck am I?

13:54.880 --> 13:57.600
I'm nobody, so stuff like that.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.720
Was he aware of that you think?

13:58.720 --> 14:01.320
He wasn't, he wasn't, I don't think he was, but.

14:01.320 --> 14:06.320
Do you give parents a pass when they're unaware

14:06.400 --> 14:09.600
of the destructive, is it better when they're unaware?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.200
Because it seems like that's the way.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.040
That's true.

14:12.040 --> 14:13.920
That's the way parents often fail,

14:13.920 --> 14:18.280
is they're not intentionally malevolent.

14:18.280 --> 14:20.200
They're just clueless.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.800
Yeah, it's a bittersweet thing,

14:22.800 --> 14:24.400
because you're like, okay, he's not malicious,

14:24.400 --> 14:27.400
he's not trying to hurt me, but also,

14:28.800 --> 14:29.960
he doesn't know he hurt me.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.280
I don't know, it's tough,

14:31.280 --> 14:33.720
because if he was trying to hurt you,

14:33.720 --> 14:35.480
I guess that would be worse.

14:35.480 --> 14:40.160
So you're the fully-baked Mark Norman cake at this point.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.920
Yeah, it's a shitty cake.

14:42.920 --> 14:43.840
Do you?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.400
Fruit salad.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.880
You know, the sense of self-worth you mentioned.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.000
I think in your comedy,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.920
there's a sense like you hate yourself.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.160
You think?

14:54.160 --> 14:55.360
I didn't know if that came through.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.400
Shit, I was trying to hide that part.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.320
God damn it.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.560
I mean, when you, like, in the privacy of your mind,

15:02.520 --> 15:05.040
are you able to love yourself,

15:05.040 --> 15:07.320
or is it mostly self-hate?

15:07.320 --> 15:09.040
Geez, what happened to this podcast?

15:09.040 --> 15:11.160
I didn't know it was on Dr. Phil.

15:11.760 --> 15:13.600
I thought we were gonna talk about engineering

15:13.600 --> 15:17.080
and climate change and rockets.

15:17.080 --> 15:17.920
We'll get there.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.760
Okay.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.040
Starts with love, goes to rockets.

15:20.040 --> 15:21.200
All right, I like that.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.400
I like that's a T-shirt.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.760
I mean, like-

15:25.760 --> 15:26.600
What's the question?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.920
Sorry.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.120
Do I feel love?

15:29.120 --> 15:29.960
No, no, like-

15:29.960 --> 15:31.160
Do I love myself?

15:31.160 --> 15:32.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, so are you,

15:34.840 --> 15:37.760
like this engine of being self-critical,

15:37.800 --> 15:40.680
of just being constantly anxious

15:40.680 --> 15:43.960
about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.240
Is this something that you just go to for comedy,

15:47.240 --> 15:50.200
or is this who you are as a human being?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.120
I think I don't wanna explore it.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.120
I think I get around it.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.360
You know, I tap dance around it,

15:55.360 --> 15:57.920
but I get it out a little with my act, maybe,

15:57.920 --> 15:59.360
because I can't do it.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.560
I'm not doing it in real life,

16:00.560 --> 16:04.800
so I'll get out this no love, not loving myself.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.160
I don't know, who wants to love themselves?

16:06.160 --> 16:07.520
Everybody always like, you gotta love yourself,

16:07.520 --> 16:09.080
and then when you meet somebody who does love yourself,

16:09.080 --> 16:11.360
you're like, I fucking hate this guy.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.680
Don't you hate the guy who's upset?

16:12.680 --> 16:15.240
I'm great, I'm awesome, life is good.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.120
You're like, ah, this guy sucks.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.000
I'd rather an insecure guy.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.200
So maybe I wanna stay insecure.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.800
Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself.

16:22.800 --> 16:27.080
Well, okay, so self-love, like, just appreciating

16:27.080 --> 16:29.040
who you are, or like appreciating the moment

16:29.040 --> 16:32.120
of being grateful, doesn't have to express itself

16:32.120 --> 16:34.760
by the guy saying, I'm awesome.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.600
True.

16:35.600 --> 16:36.600
It's more just like humility.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.440
It's just like walking calmly through the world

16:38.440 --> 16:40.520
and just being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing,

16:40.520 --> 16:44.560
and just being appreciative of all the accomplishments

16:44.560 --> 16:45.400
you made so far.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.160
I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self-critical

16:49.160 --> 16:54.160
in everything I do, and so, and I kinda enjoy it.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.160
I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun.

16:57.160 --> 16:59.080
It makes life fun, because it's like,

16:59.080 --> 17:04.080
if you hate everything you do, like you've done in the past,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.520
that gives you like, all right, we can do better.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.480
Yes, but that's the key, is making yourself critical.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.640
Always trying to get better.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.280
I can change this, I can tweak this, I can improve this.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.480
When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck,

17:15.480 --> 17:16.320
you just shut down.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.520
So that's the key, is always being productive

17:19.520 --> 17:21.360
with the criticism.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.920
Yeah, and the basics of life, I'm just like grateful for it,

17:23.920 --> 17:24.760
to be alive.

17:24.760 --> 17:27.640
That's nice to be a couple of that with self-criticism.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.400
Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.240
the world, you got a good brain on you.

17:34.280 --> 17:37.400
I mean, you're lucky, you're in the top,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.680
most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now,

17:39.680 --> 17:41.040
hitting their kids.

17:41.040 --> 17:46.040
You're in a Ramada hotel, sitting with a low-level comedian.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.720
For the record, I ate McDonald's last night.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.200
Oh, all right, well you're human.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.640
Well, just so you know, this is not me defending,

17:54.640 --> 17:57.680
I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly eat meat,

17:57.680 --> 18:01.360
and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.080
It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.000
I think it's worse, I don't know if it's actually cows.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.120
It's actually rats, yeah, you're right.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.920
But hey, it's just meat, I'm a meat guy myself.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.440
They say in 20 years, we're gonna look back and go,

18:15.440 --> 18:16.520
can you believe people ate meat?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.560
It's not like somebody liked slavery.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.080
Yeah, there's some ethical, difficult things

18:21.080 --> 18:22.640
with factory farming.

18:22.640 --> 18:26.160
Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it.

18:26.160 --> 18:27.600
And now it's on record.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.440
Tom Waits says something about New York,

18:31.440 --> 18:32.280
you like Tom Waits?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.880
I think he's underrated, I think he's got great,

18:34.880 --> 18:38.080
he's got a great, he's great at quips and quotes.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.840
Check him out on YouTube, he's got some montages

18:40.840 --> 18:43.480
and super cuts of him being hilarious.

18:43.480 --> 18:44.680
What does he say about,

18:47.040 --> 18:49.160
I'd rather have a bottle in front of me

18:49.160 --> 18:50.440
than a frontal lobotomy.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.440
That was the one, that was the one that sold me,

18:52.440 --> 18:54.120
I was like, this guy's awesome.

18:54.120 --> 18:56.920
But his music, cause he's just a genius musician.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.760
Yeah.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.760
Anyway, he was talking about New York,

18:59.760 --> 19:01.960
I was walking around these, I'm in New York right now,

19:02.800 --> 19:04.240
it's still a magical city to me.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.320
A lot of people are quite cynical about it,

19:06.320 --> 19:07.920
about the state of things, but,

19:07.920 --> 19:08.760
Go again.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.680
Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine,

19:12.680 --> 19:15.320
they're just, a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York,

19:15.320 --> 19:16.640
there's something about the pandemic

19:16.640 --> 19:19.000
where people have become quite cynical

19:19.000 --> 19:21.560
about the place they are and they try to escape.

19:21.560 --> 19:22.400
It's interesting.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.040
I mean, they're asking some difficult questions

19:24.040 --> 19:25.480
about what they are in life.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.520
They're having like a self-imposed midlife crisis.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.320
It's good, I think, for everybody

19:30.800 --> 19:32.240
to go through this process.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.560
But I think, I hope New York re-emerges.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.400
It will.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.920
As the flourishing place for the weirdos.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.720
Anyway, Tom Wade said,

19:39.720 --> 19:44.720
New York, of course, is to be in endless surreal situations

19:45.440 --> 19:49.040
where a $50,000 gun-metal Mercedes pulls up

19:49.040 --> 19:53.040
in a puddle of blood and outstops a 25-carat blonde

19:53.040 --> 19:54.560
with a $2 wristwatch.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.400
Woo!

19:55.400 --> 19:56.760
And he goes, he keeps going on.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.720
So like, it's like,

19:58.720 --> 19:59.680
That's like bars.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.560
He's like a rapper.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's good.

20:02.640 --> 20:06.240
But basically, it's just the absurdity of it all.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.800
Lots of money, lots of weirdos,

20:09.640 --> 20:14.160
degenerates and dreamers and the whole mix of it.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.000
Do you think that's an accurate description

20:18.000 --> 20:19.640
of what New York is today?

20:19.640 --> 20:22.200
Like, is there still place for the weirdos

20:22.200 --> 20:24.920
and just the interesting artists,

20:25.600 --> 20:29.760
the edgy, the comedians, the creators,

20:29.760 --> 20:34.760
the entrepreneurs, as opposed to Wall Street,

20:35.200 --> 20:40.200
as opposed to rich folk and then hopeless folk?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.680
Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.160
There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.280
New York used to be where you went to make it

20:48.280 --> 20:51.080
as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.200
And there were all these dives and shit boxes

20:53.200 --> 20:54.720
and all these places you could go.

20:55.640 --> 20:58.720
Now it's more Pink Berries and Subway Sandwiches

20:58.720 --> 20:59.560
and Chase Banks.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.960
So it's definitely lost a lot of its creative edge.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.560
It's just money, money keeps coming in.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.800
And now you see all these comedians move to Nashville,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.760
Austin, Denver, whatever.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.680
So it doesn't have the power it used to have

21:13.680 --> 21:16.040
of like, you gotta be here if you wanna make it.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.960
That's definitely gone.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.160
So that hurt the city a lot.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.920
The city is way more soulless.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.640
When I moved here in 07,

21:24.640 --> 21:26.200
I mean, not only did I get mugged three times

21:26.200 --> 21:31.160
in the first year, but it was a hub of like,

21:31.160 --> 21:33.160
it felt like things were happening here.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.920
It was an energy, it was an electricity.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.960
And we still have the electricity,

21:35.960 --> 21:38.160
but it's also maybe just because it's Times Square,

21:38.160 --> 21:41.160
there's SoHo, there's Wall Street.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.160
So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.320
It's almost like a marriage.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.480
Like, yeah, we're in love,

21:46.480 --> 21:49.560
but it's not as passionate as it once was.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.720
That's how I would equate New York.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.640
What gives you hope?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.680
You're pretty hopeful about it though.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.160
I'm hopeful just because I know it's magical

21:57.160 --> 21:59.520
and I think it has to be.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.120
I mean, it's the epicenter of America.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.000
Like, this is where the immigrants came

22:03.000 --> 22:05.400
and this is where the stock market is

22:05.400 --> 22:08.280
and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here.

22:08.280 --> 22:12.120
So I think it's gonna happen,

22:12.120 --> 22:14.680
but something like the bottom has to fall out

22:14.680 --> 22:16.680
and then people have to move back here and all that.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.600
So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.880
They're just buying everything.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.080
Well, that's true for everything.

22:22.080 --> 22:22.920
That's true for everything.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.000
Oh, it's true for Austin probably as well.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.160
People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.880
You always hear of Hemingway and Dali

22:28.880 --> 22:32.400
and all these guys went to Paris in the 20s

22:32.400 --> 22:33.880
or whatever that was.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.160
Yeah, I get it now.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.840
I used to be like, why do these guys go to Paris?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.240
Why are these artists?

22:38.240 --> 22:41.200
And now I get it because it's freer there.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.640
That's why Austin became like that Paris

22:43.640 --> 22:45.040
where everybody's like, I gotta get out of LA.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.600
I'm going there.

22:46.600 --> 22:50.240
And maybe, but we came back from that.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.520
The 70s were wild and 90s were cool.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.760
So maybe it'll come back.

22:54.760 --> 22:55.880
I just take a decade.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.680
Well, there's always, that's how stories are told.

22:57.680 --> 23:02.680
There's always pockets of like Paris within New York.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
True, true.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.960
There's just an opportunity to let your weird flourish

23:07.960 --> 23:09.640
is there in New York, I'm sure.

23:12.680 --> 23:13.520
It's there.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.340
You gotta find it.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.080
Before it was front and center.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.160
What's your favorite thing about New York?

23:18.160 --> 23:22.080
Like what kind of things just like?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.240
I mean, how long is this pod?

23:23.240 --> 23:24.080
I could go on.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.480
It's too much to put into one hour.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.480
We've got other questions,

23:28.480 --> 23:31.360
but I love that one neighborhood

23:31.360 --> 23:33.240
is wildly different than the next.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.440
I'm in Little Italy and then you take four steps.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.560
Now I'm in Chinatown.

23:36.560 --> 23:39.600
I mean, and then the history there and then the stories

23:39.600 --> 23:42.480
and the food and the culture and all that.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.160
And then you go 10 feet over here.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.160
Now you're in Brooklyn and this is insane

23:46.160 --> 23:47.120
as the whole other world.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.160
And it's almost like a little America in one city

23:53.120 --> 23:54.080
and it's great.

23:54.080 --> 23:56.720
And just the fact that they pulled it off,

23:56.720 --> 23:59.680
like Fifth Avenue goes way up and you're like,

23:59.680 --> 24:01.800
there's a billionaire's house next to a hobo.

24:01.800 --> 24:04.600
And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy

24:04.600 --> 24:07.360
and an Asian guy is trying to get in the middle of them.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.400
And the cabbies from the Middle East.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.000
And there's so many beautiful women here.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.600
And there's so many brilliant minds here.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.000
And the pace is great.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.120
It keeps people moving.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.720
I mean, it just, you can't beat it.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.600
And the city will fuck you in the ass too.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.440
Don't get me wrong.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.880
You landed JFK and you're like, oh God, I got mugged.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.440
My Uber driver called me a homo.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.400
I stepped in human shit.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.600
Where the fuck am I?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.480
So yeah, it's bad news.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.880
But that bad news, it's almost like the bullying.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.360
It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger

24:38.360 --> 24:40.520
and you build more layers and layers and layers.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.080
That's why some new guys, some hayseed from Milwaukee

24:43.080 --> 24:44.120
shows up.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.000
You've been here 10 years and you go,

24:46.880 --> 24:47.720
let me help you out.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.240
Because you gotta adjust.

24:50.240 --> 24:52.800
You're gonna get your ass kicked for like six months.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.120
But I know the rope's a little,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.920
and I think you need a little of that.

24:55.920 --> 25:00.000
If the treadmill's not on, you're not gonna run.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.320
New York, the treadmill's on.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.000
So it just makes you run and it makes you better.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.840
And look, it wears on you.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.280
You probably lose 10 years of your life

25:06.280 --> 25:09.720
living in New York versus Indianapolis.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.560
But it's a better life.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.960
Have you seen 25th Hour?

25:13.960 --> 25:15.920
Yeah, it's been a while.

25:16.760 --> 25:17.600
Spike Lee Joint?

25:17.600 --> 25:18.840
Yeah, Spike Lee Joint.

25:18.840 --> 25:23.400
I mean, at Norton, there's a whole monologue there

25:23.400 --> 25:24.240
about New York.

25:24.240 --> 25:25.280
Oh, that's right.

25:25.280 --> 25:30.200
They're talking about just, he has a mix.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.040
There's melancholy music, I think,

25:32.040 --> 25:34.200
or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.160
But there's an anger and a disgust with the city.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.880
But through the anger and the disgust

25:38.880 --> 25:41.000
comes out a love for the city.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.120
Same with, was taxi driver in New York?

25:43.120 --> 25:45.320
Oh yeah, it's quite crazy.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.920
Yeah, so like that, there's something about that.

25:47.920 --> 25:48.760
What is that?

25:48.760 --> 25:53.760
What is that grit of the city that pushes you down?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.360
Well, that's the beauty of the city

25:57.360 --> 25:59.840
is it's this tribal human nature,

25:59.840 --> 26:03.040
like the sex shops and fist fights

26:03.040 --> 26:05.600
and racism and all this tension.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.760
But yet it's the epicenter of technology

26:07.760 --> 26:10.600
and finance and sophistication on Fifth Avenue.

26:10.600 --> 26:13.880
So you get that juxtaposition.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.760
It's kind of like in Boston.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.320
They got MIT, they got Harvard, they got all this shit.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.360
And then they got the fishermen,

26:20.360 --> 26:22.880
the blue collar douchebags, the Irish guys,

26:22.880 --> 26:24.920
the immigrants, and you get that mix

26:24.920 --> 26:28.600
of insanely smart with wicked pissa

26:28.600 --> 26:31.480
and these two worlds, and that's a good thing.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.800
It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady,

26:33.800 --> 26:35.440
that's a good looking kid.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.880
You get a mix.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.480
We're mixing two totally different things

26:39.480 --> 26:40.840
that are coming together and it makes it,

26:40.840 --> 26:43.200
it's like peanut butter and chocolate.

26:43.200 --> 26:45.600
Peanut butter and chocolate, I've never tried that.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.440
What?

26:46.440 --> 26:47.280
Peanut butter, maybe I have.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.840
I'm talking about Reese's, man.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.760
Like Reese's, yeah, and yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.200
Oh, it's the best candy.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.040
Yeah.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.720
Without the fakeness of LA,

26:55.720 --> 27:00.520
without the kind of, with the facade.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.800
Yeah, LA's tough.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.760
What's the difference between LA comedy

27:05.760 --> 27:07.080
and New York comedy, too?

27:08.280 --> 27:10.600
I think one place you kind of go to make it

27:10.640 --> 27:13.520
and be discovered and be loved,

27:13.520 --> 27:16.240
and one place you go, you can get all that in New York, too,

27:16.240 --> 27:19.080
but I think in New York, it's more of a school,

27:19.080 --> 27:21.120
a boot camp of comedy.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.760
Let's make great comedy.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.000
Let's make original comedy.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.280
Let's watch the other guys and gals

27:26.280 --> 27:29.440
who are at the show at the clubs and learn from them

27:29.440 --> 27:33.240
and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.080
And in LA, it's like, when am I on?

27:36.080 --> 27:38.120
I'm next, get out of my way.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.920
I'm the star here.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.360
I'm a bigger star than you.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.640
Oh, this guy's actually a big star.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.720
I gotta outwork, you know, it's just a lot of that

27:44.720 --> 27:46.480
instead of like, damn, that was funny.

27:46.480 --> 27:47.880
I gotta be that funny.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.040
Damn, I wish I had a joke.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
And look, I don't wanna speak for LA comics

27:51.040 --> 27:52.920
because there's, you know, Bill Burr,

27:52.920 --> 27:55.320
Anthony Jeselnik, brilliant LA comic,

27:55.320 --> 27:58.560
but they all cut their teeth in New York, just saying.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.240
Then they moved to LA.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.080
That's a good point.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.400
You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics,

28:03.400 --> 28:07.240
but New York, started in New York, moved to New York.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.480
There is something about comics

28:08.480 --> 28:10.160
that's stayed in New York for a long time, though,

28:10.160 --> 28:11.080
like Dave Attell.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.600
Ah, you know about Dave?

28:12.600 --> 28:14.360
Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.200
He does?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.280
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Attell.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.120
Wow.

28:17.120 --> 28:21.120
But it's like, it's almost like he doesn't want to make it.

28:21.120 --> 28:21.960
I don't know.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.800
I mean, you probably know him, but like,

28:23.800 --> 28:27.880
it feels like you just, maybe it's romanticizing it,

28:27.880 --> 28:31.080
but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy,

28:31.080 --> 28:34.040
of like, becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,

28:34.040 --> 28:35.720
becoming funnier than the other comics,

28:35.720 --> 28:37.600
like competing with each other kind of thing,

28:37.600 --> 28:41.200
not over like money or fame or that,

28:41.200 --> 28:43.200
just purely the comedy of it.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.000
Totally, that's Dave, that's him in a nutshell.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.280
He's like that guy in the movies,

28:46.280 --> 28:48.080
in the 80s action movies where they're like,

28:48.080 --> 28:50.600
they go up to a creek in Montana

28:50.600 --> 28:53.120
and some guys live in a cabin and he's sharpening a stick

28:53.120 --> 28:56.160
and they go, the Russians are coming, they're invading,

28:56.160 --> 28:57.840
we need you, you're the best commando.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.560
And he's like, I gave that up, man.

28:59.560 --> 29:00.840
I'm done with that lifestyle.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.640
They're like, but you're the best, we need you.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.600
And he has to suit up eventually.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.200
You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife

29:06.200 --> 29:07.480
and he goes, fuck it, I'm going.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.240
And then they fight the Ruskies, but he's that guy.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.760
He just is gifted.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.800
He's like got a gift from Allah and he's the best.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.640
Yeah, a lot of comics give him props.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.840
That's always surprising to me.

29:20.840 --> 29:24.800
It's surprising to me because he hasn't really made it

29:24.800 --> 29:25.640
like big as big.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.360
He did in the 90s, he was huge.

29:27.360 --> 29:28.560
He had his own TV show.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.400
He was the player.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.960
Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome.

29:30.960 --> 29:34.280
But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.120
Well, that's art.

29:35.120 --> 29:37.920
The mainstream shit is always the worst.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.520
It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.880
I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.160
And you know, certain comics we could name are good,

29:46.160 --> 29:51.160
but the delicacy is going to be less talked about

29:52.000 --> 29:57.000
and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.760
Yeah, it's funny because he hasn't,

29:59.760 --> 30:04.120
I think he was on Joe Rogan's show once maybe.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.200
Yeah, once or twice.

30:05.200 --> 30:07.720
And he was with somebody else.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.560
Jeff Ross?

30:08.560 --> 30:10.400
Yeah, he might have known Jeff Ross.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.280
Oh yeah, because they did that like two mics thing.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.360
One with mics, yeah.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.200
Yeah.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.720
But he's the quickest guy.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.840
There's no one funnier.

30:17.840 --> 30:22.320
Yeah, yeah, him and you, you're super quick.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.920
Your appearance on, recent appearance

30:23.920 --> 30:24.760
on Rogan's hilarious.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.600
Oh, thanks.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.080
Just so fast.

30:27.080 --> 30:29.560
You're on with Ari and.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.400
Shane Gillis.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.220
Shane Gillis.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.060
Yeah, that was fun.

30:32.060 --> 30:33.560
We're going back in January.

30:33.960 --> 30:35.640
I don't know when this comes out.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.000
This will never come out.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Neither will you.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.480
We're having fun.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.560
Yep, all right.

30:42.560 --> 30:47.320
So what does it feel like to bomb in standup comedy?

30:47.320 --> 30:49.160
Like to fail?

30:49.160 --> 30:51.040
Maybe the psychology of it first,

30:51.040 --> 30:53.360
like just take me through it.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.680
Cause you were talking about being outnumbered

30:56.680 --> 30:58.240
in a fight, just being beat up.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.080
Very similar.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.760
By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.080
Yeah, yeah.

31:04.080 --> 31:04.920
I like.

31:04.920 --> 31:05.760
We're both uncomfortable.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.760
Yeah, it's great.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.720
It's kind of nice to be with my people.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.560
But yeah.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.400
Do you need a sheet of paper to look at or?

31:12.400 --> 31:16.000
I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.800
Yeah, it's a nightmare, but it's part of it.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.280
It's the validation too is the worst part.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.200
Cause you know, whenever you do comedy and kill,

31:27.200 --> 31:28.200
you can be a great comic,

31:28.200 --> 31:29.960
but even David Tell, all these brilliant guys,

31:29.960 --> 31:30.800
they feel like they're getting,

31:30.800 --> 31:32.160
you feel like you're getting away with something.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.120
I don't have a day job.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.280
I'm telling jokes for a living.

31:34.280 --> 31:35.520
I'm talking about my dick up here

31:35.520 --> 31:36.560
and they're fucking loving me.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.440
And they call me a genius and all this.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.640
I'm talking about my sack, you know?

31:40.640 --> 31:42.000
And it's great.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.320
It makes people happy and it's funny,

31:43.320 --> 31:46.760
but that bombing, when you bomb,

31:46.760 --> 31:48.840
your first thought is like, yeah, you're right.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.800
At first you're like, fuck you guy.

31:50.800 --> 31:51.760
What, you don't like this shit?

31:51.760 --> 31:53.000
And then you just start going in.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.920
You're like, maybe it isn't that good.

31:54.920 --> 31:55.760
Maybe they're right.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.680
I do suck.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.840
I knew I sucked.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.080
I should become a mailman, you know?

32:00.120 --> 32:03.600
And it stinks and you feel alone

32:03.600 --> 32:06.200
and you feel like you wasted their time

32:06.200 --> 32:07.440
and then you're like, what was I thinking?

32:07.440 --> 32:08.400
I could be a comedian.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.920
What the fuck, who am I?

32:09.920 --> 32:11.760
Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here?

32:11.760 --> 32:16.360
So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.600
But I also love that it hurts so bad.

32:18.600 --> 32:20.200
Bombing fucking hurts

32:20.200 --> 32:23.280
because now everybody doesn't do it.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.240
I think a lot more people could do comedy probably

32:25.240 --> 32:28.600
and figure it out, but the bombing is so brutal

32:28.640 --> 32:31.520
that it keeps, one time I went to Minneapolis.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.600
I was like, this is a great city.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.840
I mean, the sun is shining.

32:33.840 --> 32:35.480
Why isn't this city like packed?

32:35.480 --> 32:36.960
And they're like, because the winters are so bad

32:36.960 --> 32:38.720
and we love it because it keeps everybody out.

32:38.720 --> 32:39.880
And I feel like the same about comedy.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.880
The bombs are so brutal.

32:41.880 --> 32:43.360
I've had bombs where I'm in bed.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.720
I'm just staring at the ceiling like,

32:44.720 --> 32:45.800
what the fuck was that?

32:45.800 --> 32:47.440
Like you have PTSD.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.000
I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.520
I did 30 minutes to silence.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.360
I guess-

32:53.360 --> 32:54.840
So it's not just like one joke fails.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.320
It's like they start piling on.

32:57.320 --> 32:58.600
Like it's irrecoverable.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.000
Yes, and one joke failing is very common.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.880
Like a lot of audiences don't even notice that bomb

33:03.880 --> 33:05.600
because you get so many jokes in a row.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.200
You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one,

33:07.200 --> 33:08.200
then a good one.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.520
But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose,

33:10.520 --> 33:12.200
we don't like you.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.520
Nothing you say will redeem yourself.

33:14.520 --> 33:16.840
And it's hard to get out of.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.320
It's like being pulled down by your hair.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.440
You can't get back.

33:19.440 --> 33:22.000
I can't win this fight no matter what.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.680
Can you like get them back by acknowledging

33:24.680 --> 33:27.120
like the elephant in the room that like-

33:27.960 --> 33:31.360
That was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.200
He still sucks.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.400
He still sucks.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.360
That's the worst part.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.120
You're going, no, this is good.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.240
You guys just don't like me.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.560
Just because you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.760
Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot.

33:41.760 --> 33:45.560
Just listening because first of all,

33:45.560 --> 33:47.160
I think the audience in the open mic,

33:47.160 --> 33:49.480
at least the ones I've been to,

33:49.480 --> 33:51.920
is mostly I guess other comedians

33:51.920 --> 33:54.280
or like at least people who don't seem to wanna laugh

33:54.280 --> 33:55.120
at anything.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.320
And so I just love it

33:57.320 --> 34:00.560
because it's human nature and perseverance that is best.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.640
Here's comedians, like clearly,

34:03.640 --> 34:04.840
this is mostly in Austin.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.160
They have a dream.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.800
Like why would you get up there?

34:07.800 --> 34:08.640
Right.

34:09.680 --> 34:13.880
Maybe some weird, you know, New Year's resolution bullshit,

34:13.880 --> 34:16.280
but for the most part, it's people who wanna be comedians.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.520
Like a lot of the open micers are people

34:18.520 --> 34:21.200
who have clearly have done this for quite a long time.

34:21.200 --> 34:24.480
Like at least a year or two, maybe five years.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.120
And they're often not very funny.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.200
And just bombing in front of an audience of like 20

34:36.760 --> 34:38.440
where they're just sitting there

34:40.400 --> 34:43.880
almost like mocking them with their eyes or maybe,

34:43.880 --> 34:46.000
and I don't know, and they still push through.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.400
They still like as if they're doing an arena

34:49.400 --> 34:51.080
and everybody's laughing.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.040
Yes.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.320
They still got that energy trying,

34:55.160 --> 34:58.200
almost like to an audience that doesn't exist,

34:58.200 --> 35:00.040
like an audience of their dreams.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.960
Cause I guess you have to do that

35:01.960 --> 35:03.760
to keep the energy of the act going.

35:03.760 --> 35:07.080
And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.760
And also what happens, open mic, I don't know,

35:11.760 --> 35:13.880
five minutes, whatever they do,

35:13.880 --> 35:18.880
they walk off and then walk back off stage.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.920
And like, you can't, who do they look at?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.080
Like, what do you look at?

35:23.080 --> 35:24.920
Do you make eye contact with people?

35:24.920 --> 35:25.760
Do you?

35:25.760 --> 35:27.400
You look at your phone, you look at your feet,

35:27.400 --> 35:28.680
you just zone out.

35:28.680 --> 35:32.080
You kind of kind of go white.

35:32.080 --> 35:34.480
You know, you just hear white noise and go out.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.280
It's tough, but you got it.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.440
You need a little delusion to be a comedian.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.400
To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.

35:42.400 --> 35:44.600
Like you think you can do this, you know,

35:44.600 --> 35:47.000
you got 10 years ahead of you of hell

35:47.000 --> 35:48.720
and you're up for this.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.040
And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd

35:51.040 --> 35:53.280
and we see our friend bomb and we go,

35:53.280 --> 35:55.040
yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him.

35:55.040 --> 35:56.480
I'll get him.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.960
And then you don't get him.

35:58.960 --> 36:02.120
But that's human nature too.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.440
It's like, they don't like him, but they'll like me.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.160
And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.360
But you don't want too much delusion

36:08.360 --> 36:09.600
because then you're a psycho.

36:09.600 --> 36:11.960
But you need a little.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.960
Well, a psycho could be good for a comedy.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.720
That's true too, a lot of psychos.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.760
I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon

36:18.760 --> 36:20.400
and we talked about doing standup

36:20.560 --> 36:22.960
and he's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.680
Say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.640
Well, maybe you should move to Austin

36:28.640 --> 36:30.640
to coach him full time.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.120
Hopefully he can fly me in.

36:32.120 --> 36:36.240
So what advice would you give to somebody

36:36.240 --> 36:39.200
who wants to try to do five minutes,

36:39.200 --> 36:44.200
like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic

36:45.000 --> 36:46.520
and say something funny?

36:46.520 --> 36:48.480
Well, that's the irony of comedy is,

36:48.480 --> 36:49.320
I don't know if it's irony,

36:49.320 --> 36:51.760
but it's like the beginning is the hardest part.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.400
Usually the beginning is the easy part.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.280
Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario.

36:55.280 --> 36:57.800
I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.600
And then the end is like, Jesus Christ,

36:59.600 --> 37:01.200
I got 30 guys coming at me.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.160
Comedy is the opposite.

37:02.160 --> 37:05.000
The beginning is like, it's a gauntlet.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.960
It's just obstacles and it's like you said, open mics.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.040
I watched these famous comedians on Netflix

37:10.040 --> 37:12.080
and you go, this would all bomb an open mic.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.240
They're killing in Radio City.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.360
This would bomb an open mic.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.320
That's the weird part.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.040
So it's almost like you have to go through hell

37:18.040 --> 37:21.320
just to get to the promised land.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.280
And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it

37:25.280 --> 37:26.800
because you're gonna get frazzled up there.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.560
Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material.

37:28.560 --> 37:31.240
But you also forget about the other part of delivering it,

37:31.240 --> 37:34.840
having confidence, being likable, having timing,

37:34.840 --> 37:37.120
having a cadence, figuring out who you are,

37:37.120 --> 37:39.280
figuring out what the audience thinks you are

37:39.280 --> 37:40.840
or how they perceive you.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.160
Because you can go up there and say all this,

37:42.160 --> 37:44.400
but they go, why is the guy, he's clearly gay.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.080
Why is he actually, he's not gay.

37:46.080 --> 37:47.800
That's all that, now they're not listening to the joke.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.320
You gotta know how you look.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.160
And it's just repetition, repetition.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.960
And bombing is not failure.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.080
That's what you gotta remember.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.600
I mean, look, if you do a killer hour

37:58.600 --> 38:01.120
and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you're fucked up.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.800
But bombing is not failure, it's just data.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.680
It's going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.760
That didn't work, something's wrong there.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.120
I missed a word there.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.920
So you gotta treat the act almost like ingredients

38:15.640 --> 38:20.640
in a cooking, in a dish, like, oh, I put too many eggs in,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.320
take an egg out, you gotta treat it like that.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.520
And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven,

38:26.520 --> 38:27.840
you go, I fucked up.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.520
But it doesn't hurt your feelings.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.400
But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.600
So you gotta factor that in too.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.040
Your feeling's gonna be hurt.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.840
And just almost be a robot

38:36.840 --> 38:39.240
and just keep going towards that open mic.

38:39.240 --> 38:40.840
You know how scary an open mic is?

38:40.840 --> 38:43.480
Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians

38:43.480 --> 38:44.640
is way worse.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.120
Because they know what just happened.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.440
And they could have saved you and they didn't.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.200
So it's way worse.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.040
And they're gonna be your quote unquote friends

38:55.240 --> 38:56.120
for this journey.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.040
Yeah, no, these are evil people, most of them.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.800
Twisted, fucked up, hurt people.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.240
Can you tell in those early days,

39:05.240 --> 39:08.040
let's just talk about that, at the open mic level,

39:08.040 --> 39:11.200
that a joke is gonna be good on paper?

39:11.240 --> 39:12.680
Like, I'll give you my experience,

39:12.680 --> 39:16.600
because maybe you could be my coach

39:16.600 --> 39:18.160
in this particular moment.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.000
So.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.160
You're like Larry Nassar.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.400
That's fun, huh?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.240
Joking, everybody.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.000
I hope nobody takes this seriously.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.960
I now have an amazing team of folks

39:30.960 --> 39:31.960
who help me with editing,

39:31.960 --> 39:33.480
and they're now currently sweating.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.960
You gotta leave that one in, that was quick.

39:35.960 --> 39:36.800
Yeah, that's pretty good.

39:36.800 --> 39:37.720
I'll eat that one.

39:37.720 --> 39:38.560
That was good.

39:39.080 --> 39:44.080
All right, so going in front of an audience,

39:45.120 --> 39:47.480
just even to give a lecture terrifies me,

39:48.520 --> 39:51.600
which I've done, but open mic,

39:51.600 --> 39:54.200
I mean, that to me, perhaps that's why I like

39:54.200 --> 39:55.640
going to open mics and listening,

39:55.640 --> 39:58.960
is because I just, it terrifies me so much,

39:58.960 --> 40:02.640
that idea of going up there and bombing.

40:02.640 --> 40:03.760
I mean, it's scary.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.720
And to do even like one minute, to be honest,

40:06.720 --> 40:08.560
is scary, and five minutes.

40:08.560 --> 40:11.720
I'm also watched enough open mics to realize

40:11.720 --> 40:13.080
that five minutes is a long time.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.320
I mean, it depends on your comedy,

40:15.320 --> 40:18.840
but if you're doing fast stuff,

40:18.840 --> 40:20.520
five minutes is a really long time.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
Oh, it's eternity.

40:22.440 --> 40:26.320
I guess with a long story, too, is a long time,

40:26.320 --> 40:27.880
because if the story's not,

40:27.880 --> 40:29.040
you're building up to something,

40:29.040 --> 40:31.000
if the story's gonna fail,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.440
you just spent all that time telling the story

40:33.440 --> 40:35.520
that completely went flat.

40:35.520 --> 40:36.600
Completely. Got nothing.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.320
I guess if you have a series of jokes,

40:38.320 --> 40:39.720
you can at least try to recover

40:39.720 --> 40:41.360
and do the Mitch Hedberg thing,

40:41.360 --> 40:43.040
where like, all right, I'll cross that off.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, yeah.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.760
Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things,

40:48.760 --> 40:51.720
and I'm able to tell that it's really bad.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.360
Ah, well that's better than most.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.840
Most people's egos kick in and go, no, this is good.

40:56.840 --> 40:59.160
No, see, I'm able to introspect that,

40:59.160 --> 41:00.600
like it seems funny.

41:00.600 --> 41:03.440
I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for is original.

41:03.480 --> 41:08.360
Like, there's easy stuff that you think is funny,

41:08.360 --> 41:10.880
but to me, originality is the thing

41:10.880 --> 41:12.040
you should be looking for,

41:12.040 --> 41:17.040
because then that's what actually becomes funny.

41:18.320 --> 41:23.320
Or rather, if it's original, even if it bombs,

41:23.320 --> 41:27.840
that feels like more a beautiful art creation that you did.

41:27.840 --> 41:29.720
Like at least you swung for it.

41:29.720 --> 41:30.960
Like you did something unique,

41:30.960 --> 41:33.880
because even with open mic, your first five minutes,

41:33.880 --> 41:36.440
there's so many, just go to enough open mics,

41:36.440 --> 41:39.440
you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes

41:39.440 --> 41:40.640
that you can just go to.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.280
First of all, you can make fun of the fact

41:42.280 --> 41:44.040
that you're at an open mic,

41:44.040 --> 41:46.880
that you're like doing this for the first time and so on.

41:46.880 --> 41:49.120
You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun

41:49.120 --> 41:51.640
of your appearance in some way and so on.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.680
But like, yeah, you could do that, you know,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.600
that takes actually, that's way harder than people realize

41:57.600 --> 41:59.440
to do in an original way.

41:59.440 --> 42:00.280
Yes.

42:00.440 --> 42:05.160
You present who you are as a person very quickly,

42:05.160 --> 42:07.880
enough to then put that person down

42:07.880 --> 42:09.600
in front of everybody else.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.520
So you have to reveal the...

42:11.520 --> 42:12.360
But audiences like that,

42:12.360 --> 42:13.840
because they go, he knows what we're thinking.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.680
Yeah, exactly.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.320
But do it again in an original way.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.960
And so like when I'm trying to write stuff,

42:19.960 --> 42:23.840
oh, not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes,

42:23.840 --> 42:27.480
but as enough to see like, oh shit,

42:27.480 --> 42:29.960
to write something original is really difficult.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.320
You got a bit, anything?

42:32.320 --> 42:33.160
No.

42:33.160 --> 42:34.560
You didn't write any one line or anything?

42:34.560 --> 42:35.520
For this, no.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.360
Well, just in general, ever in your life,

42:37.360 --> 42:38.200
ever written a joke?

42:38.200 --> 42:39.280
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.120
Oh, okay.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.280
No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up.

42:42.280 --> 42:47.280
So the jokes that I've written have more,

42:47.440 --> 42:50.880
like for some reason my mind goes to like dark places.

42:50.880 --> 42:55.600
So, you know, like, and not actually dark

42:55.600 --> 42:59.680
in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.160
To where it's like almost absurd.

43:02.160 --> 43:05.920
My natural inclination is to go to like

43:05.920 --> 43:10.920
a dark historical place like Hitler and Stalin.

43:12.320 --> 43:15.880
And almost, so go to that place

43:15.880 --> 43:20.880
and then talk about something absurd there.

43:21.320 --> 43:26.320
So like, don't go like all the way, I don't know,

43:27.120 --> 43:29.920
I don't wanna give examples because it'd be clipped,

43:30.920 --> 43:33.360
but the Mark Norman style, look it up.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.960
He has a special on his YouTube.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.360
That kind, I want to almost explore the dark aspects

43:39.360 --> 43:42.720
of human nature more kind of connected

43:42.720 --> 43:44.240
to actual historical figures.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.240
That's the inclination.

43:47.240 --> 43:48.920
Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal,

43:48.920 --> 43:51.520
the Instagram channel that explores

43:51.520 --> 43:55.440
like the darkness of nature, like something there.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.160
See, that's good that you already know

43:57.160 --> 43:59.200
that you've kinda gotten to the core

43:59.200 --> 44:02.000
of your comedy already, and that's interesting.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.520
That's a step ahead.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.880
Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life,

44:05.880 --> 44:08.200
I can like hear the music from a distance,

44:08.200 --> 44:12.080
like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything,

44:12.080 --> 44:13.960
this is the direction it'll be

44:13.960 --> 44:16.280
without actually knowing exactly all the steps.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.160
And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right,

44:18.160 --> 44:19.880
well, if you do this for a long time,

44:19.880 --> 44:22.200
maybe you'll have a chance to get there.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.240
But you have to, that's where it's a feature

44:25.240 --> 44:27.600
to be super self-critical, I think.

44:27.600 --> 44:30.280
But then that's why it's fucking terrifying

44:30.280 --> 44:33.240
to walk up to a stage, stand there,

44:33.240 --> 44:34.720
and probably forget everything.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.520
Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about.

44:36.520 --> 44:37.960
Just goes right out of your head.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.880
You go fight or flight, it's ugly.

44:39.880 --> 44:43.760
My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering,

44:43.760 --> 44:45.520
horrific not remembering the punchline.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.080
Like, you gotta, maybe you got a setup going

44:48.080 --> 44:49.280
and they're kinda on board, and you're like,

44:49.280 --> 44:52.040
ah, how's that, I can't remember how it goes.

44:52.040 --> 44:55.560
And you just hate yourself, it's a nightmare.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.040
But you've already kind of,

44:57.080 --> 44:58.720
maybe if you haven't done stand-up or whatever,

44:58.720 --> 44:59.960
you kinda know your voice.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.800
And that's, that's pretty advanced.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.360
So you're not trying to be somebody else.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.640
I guess, yeah, just for having done podcasts

45:07.640 --> 45:09.200
and lectures and so on.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.040
That helps.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.720
I've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work

45:12.720 --> 45:15.160
of the stand-ups do, which is embarrass yourself

45:15.160 --> 45:17.440
in front of others for prolonged periods of time.

45:17.440 --> 45:18.280
Yes.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.560
Yeah, so I've done that

45:20.560 --> 45:22.440
without actually developing the funny.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.600
Right, right, right.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.840
But maybe the funny just is not that difficult

45:26.840 --> 45:30.200
to develop, no, it's super difficult, of course,

45:30.200 --> 45:32.040
but I mean, maybe the essential work

45:32.040 --> 45:34.440
of a stand-up comedian is just the embarrassment

45:34.440 --> 45:36.120
of finding who you are.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.800
Yeah, that's a part of it, for sure.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.880
You know, in the beginning, you're like, water bottle.

45:39.880 --> 45:41.120
What's funny about water bottle?

45:41.120 --> 45:42.560
Hmm, I'm a funny guy, I can make this funny,

45:42.560 --> 45:44.400
but that ain't, that's not it, you know?

45:44.400 --> 45:47.080
It's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.160
For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark,

45:50.160 --> 45:52.960
but in a weird way where, you know, people will say like,

45:52.960 --> 45:54.680
hey, don't objectify women.

45:54.680 --> 45:57.560
But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful.

45:57.560 --> 46:00.920
And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here.

46:00.920 --> 46:05.560
Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel?

46:05.560 --> 46:06.760
So what's going on there?

46:06.760 --> 46:08.520
And I like to play with that.

46:08.520 --> 46:12.000
So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner,

46:13.160 --> 46:15.240
oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful, beautiful woman.

46:15.240 --> 46:16.280
I go, well, you look like her.

46:16.280 --> 46:17.920
And they go, fuck you.

46:17.920 --> 46:20.200
And you're like, there's a lot of truth there.

46:20.200 --> 46:23.080
But I like exploring that kind of,

46:23.080 --> 46:24.640
oh, you're trying to get one over on me,

46:25.600 --> 46:27.200
or you're lying to yourself, or what are we doing here?

46:27.200 --> 46:29.000
And I like that kind of comedy.

46:30.280 --> 46:31.120
I don't see color.

46:31.120 --> 46:31.960
Well, I'm black.

46:31.960 --> 46:32.800
No, you're not.

46:32.800 --> 46:36.080
Ah, you know, that's fun, because you're lying.

46:37.840 --> 46:41.400
Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians,

46:41.400 --> 46:43.560
such as yourself, don't like to think of yourself

46:43.560 --> 46:47.360
in this way, but yeah, this is like

46:47.360 --> 46:50.720
where you over-philosophize comedy, but.

46:50.720 --> 46:51.720
Yeah, definitely.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.280
It seems like comedians.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.120
Don't say important.

46:56.120 --> 46:58.040
Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.160
Yeah, so I was going there, I was trying to find,

47:00.160 --> 47:01.960
as I was trying to say these words,

47:01.960 --> 47:06.400
I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.600
So I'm going to just, but there is something.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.920
I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.200
I'm like, who cares about comedy?

47:12.200 --> 47:14.120
There's like six comics on the planet.

47:14.120 --> 47:14.960
Nobody cares.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.920
Okay, I trust you in the pilot seat.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.840
You know what you're doing, you got listeners.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.040
Dave tuned out long ago.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.640
Dan Carlin on here, huh?

47:24.640 --> 47:25.600
Is he around?

47:25.600 --> 47:28.040
Yeah, we're just going back and forth on Twitter,

47:28.040 --> 47:29.520
just now, he's a huge fan.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.720
He was on here before, he'll be back.

47:31.720 --> 47:35.840
I've been actually really trying to volunteer myself

47:35.840 --> 47:40.320
aggressively with Dan Carlin for like a Russian episode

47:40.320 --> 47:42.280
where I could speak Russian.

47:42.280 --> 47:46.000
There's certain documents, I talked with Jaco about this too.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.800
Certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge

47:49.800 --> 47:52.800
of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian

47:52.800 --> 47:55.760
and then can translate and can try to capture

47:55.760 --> 48:00.760
the depth of the writing in the Russian language

48:01.840 --> 48:03.600
and communicate to an American audience.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.040
So much is lost in translation.

48:05.040 --> 48:09.240
Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.

48:09.240 --> 48:10.840
It's just connected to the culture.

48:10.840 --> 48:13.040
Every language, not every language,

48:13.040 --> 48:18.040
but many languages are uniquely able to capture

48:18.240 --> 48:19.560
the culture of the people.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.480
I mean, in some way, they're the representation

48:21.480 --> 48:23.160
of the culture of the people.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.840
And so Russian is definitely that,

48:24.840 --> 48:26.960
like represents the full history and culture

48:26.960 --> 48:28.880
of the 20th century with all the atrocities,

48:28.880 --> 48:32.160
all the broken promises, all those kinds of things.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.320
Norm says Russian literature is,

48:35.320 --> 48:37.400
it's the most tapped into human existence

48:37.400 --> 48:38.360
than anything else.

48:39.440 --> 48:40.280
Norm.

48:40.280 --> 48:41.120
McDonald.

48:41.120 --> 48:41.960
Yeah.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.640
Big Russian literature guy, Dostoevsky, all that shit.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.280
It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too.

48:48.280 --> 48:50.280
There's a culture of Russian comedy,

48:50.280 --> 48:52.320
like stand-up comedians that are totally-

48:52.320 --> 48:53.200
Really?

48:53.200 --> 48:54.040
Yeah, yeah.

48:54.040 --> 48:55.560
I don't know these Russians.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.320
I mean, I don't know today.

48:57.320 --> 49:01.000
I mean, more from the 80s and 90s and there was a-

49:01.000 --> 49:03.960
Yakov, that's all I know.

49:03.960 --> 49:07.000
That's not, so there's like, of course, that's-

49:07.000 --> 49:08.640
I've never seen you that offended.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.000
No, no, no, it's not offended.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.080
There's a different,

49:13.520 --> 49:16.920
there's like the kinesins and the,

49:16.920 --> 49:18.480
there's the edgy-

49:18.480 --> 49:19.520
Is that Russian?

49:20.440 --> 49:21.280
What do you mean?

49:21.280 --> 49:23.160
Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.000
Yeah, Russian comics.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.320
I mean, I'm comparing them.

49:25.320 --> 49:29.080
I'm giving you like a style of darkness,

49:29.080 --> 49:32.360
like that's the kind that people that kind of challenge,

49:33.920 --> 49:37.880
they give, again, this is to how important comedians are,

49:37.880 --> 49:42.280
is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union,

49:42.280 --> 49:46.480
you really can't like express your opposition

49:46.480 --> 49:47.560
to the government.

49:47.560 --> 49:52.160
And so comedians are exceptionally important there

49:52.160 --> 49:55.200
for just, I don't know, channeling the anger,

49:55.200 --> 49:57.280
even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition

49:57.280 --> 50:00.840
to the government, they're just channeling the anger,

50:00.840 --> 50:02.960
the frustration with the absurdity of life.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.840
Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food,

50:05.840 --> 50:10.480
shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,

50:10.480 --> 50:13.560
like the top heavy government,

50:13.560 --> 50:17.880
just all of that can only sometimes be expressed

50:17.880 --> 50:20.560
with like dark, absurd humor.

50:20.560 --> 50:22.920
And that actually, why there's a culture

50:22.920 --> 50:24.760
of that kind of humor, you know,

50:24.760 --> 50:27.560
you gather around the table with vodka

50:27.560 --> 50:31.920
and all you can do is just talk shit and just-

50:31.920 --> 50:35.080
Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust.

50:35.080 --> 50:36.880
I mean, I make school shooting jokes

50:36.880 --> 50:37.880
and people go, how do you do that?

50:37.880 --> 50:40.200
I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it.

50:40.760 --> 50:45.560
How come I gotta empathize the way you do?

50:45.560 --> 50:46.600
Maybe we're different.

50:47.840 --> 50:50.840
All right, so now let's skip the whole open mic thing

50:50.840 --> 50:53.760
and crafting jokes.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.400
Oh, that's tough.

50:55.400 --> 50:59.400
Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words

50:59.400 --> 51:00.760
and they will be simple.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.800
When do you know the joke is done?

51:03.800 --> 51:04.960
It's perfect.

51:04.960 --> 51:08.520
You're somebody that does like really sharp,

51:08.520 --> 51:12.120
like fast jokes well.

51:12.120 --> 51:13.240
Oh, thanks.

51:13.240 --> 51:15.720
So like there's somebody, I don't know,

51:15.720 --> 51:18.600
I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as,

51:18.600 --> 51:23.600
like you're darker and faster than Hedberg, I think,

51:23.960 --> 51:26.760
in terms of like, just, I don't know,

51:26.760 --> 51:29.120
the turns you take are very-

51:29.120 --> 51:30.400
Thanks, I appreciate it.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.520
I think I got some Norm MacDonald and maybe-

51:32.520 --> 51:34.080
That's right, Norm.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.920
Obviously Norm, but Chris Rock was huge for me.

51:37.520 --> 51:40.400
Old like 90s Chris Rock was like,

51:40.400 --> 51:41.800
I didn't know you could do jokes like that.

51:41.800 --> 51:45.120
I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx and Bill Murray.

51:45.120 --> 51:47.240
There's so many different types of comedy,

51:47.240 --> 51:50.400
but when I saw the bigger and blacker Bring the Pain,

51:50.400 --> 51:54.000
I was like, oh my God, this like hit me.

51:54.000 --> 51:54.840
So that was big.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.160
And then Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet.

51:57.160 --> 51:59.400
So him being the smartest guy in the room,

51:59.400 --> 52:01.360
but acting dumb was great.

52:01.360 --> 52:04.920
So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting

52:04.920 --> 52:08.400
to the bullshit, which I mentioned earlier.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.000
I like that cutting through the bullshit

52:10.000 --> 52:12.880
kind of style of comedy, because you kind of go,

52:12.880 --> 52:13.800
oh, I'm not crazy.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.040
That's what I thought too.

52:15.040 --> 52:16.760
I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.480
And he's saying it in a room of people are laughing.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.280
Maybe I'm not an idiot.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.880
So that helped me.

52:22.880 --> 52:27.880
So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld observational.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.440
It's like going to the darker thing to like within society.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.000
But I like him too, but seeing it,

52:35.000 --> 52:38.920
doing it about stuff like in your life, society.

52:38.920 --> 52:42.680
Yeah, race, gender, government, politics,

52:42.680 --> 52:43.520
all that kind of stuff.

52:43.520 --> 52:46.800
Exactly, exactly, sex, human emotions, jealousy,

52:46.800 --> 52:48.800
whatever it is, that's the good stuff.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.280
How'd you feel when Norm passed away?

52:53.480 --> 52:57.160
That was a bummer because he was, you know, what, 61?

52:57.160 --> 53:00.520
And I just didn't see it coming.

53:00.520 --> 53:04.240
And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff

53:04.240 --> 53:07.080
and I've met him and he's like,

53:07.080 --> 53:09.360
he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm,

53:09.360 --> 53:11.000
you know, there's so much shit comedy.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.440
Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.560
This is savant type shit.

53:15.560 --> 53:18.000
And then to lose him is like, ah,

53:18.000 --> 53:21.720
Norm had 20 more years at least of just content

53:21.720 --> 53:24.760
and content and thoughts and his point of view.

53:24.760 --> 53:27.600
And that's, we'll never get that and that sucks.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.360
Yeah, there is something about artists

53:29.360 --> 53:32.040
like Jimi Hendrix dying too early.

53:32.040 --> 53:34.080
It's like, you wonder.

53:34.080 --> 53:35.040
What was next?

53:35.040 --> 53:36.240
Yeah, what was next?

53:36.240 --> 53:39.920
But then part of it is like, you know,

53:39.920 --> 53:43.320
it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early

53:44.280 --> 53:47.920
is, it's kind of admirable.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.840
It's almost like I did a pretty good job.

53:50.840 --> 53:51.680
Yeah.

53:51.680 --> 53:53.800
I'm good with that.

53:53.800 --> 53:56.600
And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.560
I know, nine years, his best friends didn't even know.

53:59.560 --> 54:02.280
And in this world of like victimhood and I need clicks

54:02.280 --> 54:04.280
and I need people to love me, he could have,

54:04.280 --> 54:06.720
he got canceled and yelled at and in trouble

54:06.720 --> 54:09.040
and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did.

54:09.040 --> 54:11.760
I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.160
Did you get a chance to interact with him?

54:13.160 --> 54:15.160
Like what, how often did you meet him?

54:15.160 --> 54:17.560
I met him once at the Comedy Cellar

54:17.560 --> 54:19.440
and we chatted for five minutes.

54:19.440 --> 54:21.880
And then he went on and did the Letterman set that he did.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.840
He was running the Letterman set and sweet guy, nice guy.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.000
I didn't know him that well, but I mean, he's just brilliant.

54:29.000 --> 54:33.160
And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff.

54:33.160 --> 54:36.440
That's a fun, fun little combo there.

54:36.440 --> 54:40.360
Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.440
You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic

54:42.440 --> 54:45.960
and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid.

54:45.960 --> 54:49.560
And you're like, that's great that he still finds farts funny

54:49.560 --> 54:52.120
and he's also this comedic genius guy.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.440
I like that.

54:53.440 --> 54:55.400
And doesn't really acknowledge the genius.

54:55.440 --> 54:57.280
Yeah, yeah.

54:57.280 --> 55:00.720
Yeah, I like smart people there, silly.

55:00.720 --> 55:02.840
Yes, that's a good combo.

55:02.840 --> 55:04.160
Like you said, Elon is silly.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.080
Yeah, super silly. Yeah, that's great.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.400
Cause we taught, we teach kids like,

55:08.400 --> 55:10.120
hey, put that down, stop that,

55:10.120 --> 55:12.360
quit cutting up, quit horsing around.

55:12.360 --> 55:15.000
But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.760
Yeah, being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom.

55:19.760 --> 55:21.640
I feel like those people are way wiser

55:21.640 --> 55:23.960
than the people that, no offense to me,

55:23.960 --> 55:26.880
wear a suit and take themselves away too seriously.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.520
No, but you got a spark in you.

55:28.520 --> 55:29.880
A little bit. You got a little,

55:29.880 --> 55:31.120
what's the word?

55:31.120 --> 55:35.640
Not elf, imp, little imp in you.

55:35.640 --> 55:36.480
Give that a go.

55:36.480 --> 55:38.000
You know what imp?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.160
Yeah, let's look at this.

55:39.160 --> 55:40.520
It's like a little.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.640
Is that a Tolkien character?

55:42.640 --> 55:43.760
Imp. Yeah, might be.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.880
Imp is the European mythological being

55:45.880 --> 55:47.560
similar to a fairy or a demon.

55:47.560 --> 55:48.520
You call me a fairy?

55:48.520 --> 55:50.080
Well. Frequently.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.480
No, okay, similar to a fairy or a demon.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.240
I feel like that's a big leap.

55:55.240 --> 55:58.600
Big leap, yeah, that's not a great info bio there.

55:58.600 --> 56:01.280
Frequently described in folklore and superstition,

56:01.280 --> 56:04.520
the word may perhaps derive from the term imp,

56:04.520 --> 56:05.840
spelled with a Y.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.560
Used to denote a young, grafted tree.

56:09.880 --> 56:11.120
It's a little mischievous.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.040
You got a twinkle.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.800
You're this serious buttoned up guy,

56:13.800 --> 56:14.960
but this is a twinkle.

56:14.960 --> 56:16.520
Is a twinkle.

56:16.520 --> 56:17.920
And the audience can see the twinkle,

56:17.920 --> 56:19.760
and that's why you resonate, I think.

56:21.400 --> 56:22.520
I'm sorry.

56:22.520 --> 56:25.880
Deep analysis by Mark Norman, psychological analysis.

56:25.880 --> 56:28.880
Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke.

56:28.880 --> 56:30.680
You said Chris Rock and Norm MacDonald.

56:30.680 --> 56:31.720
What for you?

56:32.760 --> 56:35.400
How do you know when the joke is done?

56:35.400 --> 56:37.800
Are there some jokes when you are proud of,

56:37.800 --> 56:40.960
wow, that's well done?

56:40.960 --> 56:43.360
Yeah, the joke is done.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.280
It's a tough question

56:44.280 --> 56:45.480
because there's so many different kinds of jokes.

56:45.480 --> 56:46.920
There's what we call a chunk,

56:46.920 --> 56:49.200
which is a big idea with a bunch of jokes

56:49.200 --> 56:50.120
in the middle of it,

56:50.120 --> 56:53.160
and then a big crescendo at the end.

56:53.160 --> 56:54.600
Or there's a one-liner,

56:54.600 --> 56:57.640
or there's a tag of a joke that's also a joke.

56:57.640 --> 57:01.600
So the jokes come in different,

57:01.600 --> 57:02.560
like I have a joke where I say,

57:02.560 --> 57:04.480
I met my girl on that Jewish app.

57:04.480 --> 57:06.640
What's that Jewish app called?

57:06.640 --> 57:08.040
PayPal.

57:08.040 --> 57:08.880
Nice.

57:10.040 --> 57:12.760
That's the reaction you want from the crowd.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.480
But it's a fun turn,

57:15.480 --> 57:17.080
because you say your thing,

57:17.080 --> 57:18.360
and then I hit you with a misdirect,

57:18.360 --> 57:19.400
and that's what a joke is.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.920
The joke is basically me saying something

57:21.920 --> 57:22.840
that makes sense,

57:22.840 --> 57:24.520
but you didn't see it coming.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.200
And that's a perfect example of that.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.960
So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way.

57:30.040 --> 57:32.680
But you have to go to different services like PayPal.

57:32.680 --> 57:33.600
What's funniest?

57:33.600 --> 57:35.800
Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny

57:35.800 --> 57:38.080
because it has the word pay in it.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.400
Venmo, it's also not really a good word.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.080
Venmo, PayPal.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.200
It just hits better.

57:43.200 --> 57:44.800
Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow.

57:44.800 --> 57:45.640
It's funnier somehow,

57:45.640 --> 57:46.480
and that's the beauty of comedy.

57:46.480 --> 57:47.960
There's a weird little magic into it.

57:47.960 --> 57:50.160
You can get technical all day and formulaic,

57:50.160 --> 57:53.640
but there's still that little bit of fairy dust

57:53.640 --> 57:55.880
that you don't know why this is funnier.

57:55.880 --> 57:56.720
Or imp dust.

57:56.720 --> 57:58.880
Imp dust, yes.

57:58.880 --> 58:00.920
The why, okay.

58:00.920 --> 58:02.640
So you know a joke is done when it kills,

58:02.640 --> 58:04.680
and there's a roundness to a joke

58:04.680 --> 58:06.440
when you feel like this is buttoned up.

58:06.440 --> 58:07.880
This is done here.

58:07.880 --> 58:10.000
Is simplicity the right word there?

58:10.000 --> 58:10.840
Yeah.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.720
Is it like you're chopping stuff away

58:12.720 --> 58:13.760
or you're adding stuff?

58:13.760 --> 58:14.600
What does it feel like?

58:14.600 --> 58:17.280
Simplicity is always the best angle.

58:17.280 --> 58:19.400
I mean you can get real high concept with a joke

58:19.400 --> 58:20.320
and still make it work,

58:20.320 --> 58:22.120
but the simpler the better.

58:22.120 --> 58:24.920
I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once,

58:24.920 --> 58:28.120
and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back

58:28.120 --> 58:29.960
watching in awe.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.400
And Dave Chappelle, I can't remember the joke,

58:31.400 --> 58:34.000
but he said something about sex or women,

58:34.000 --> 58:35.560
and Demetri Martin goes,

58:35.560 --> 58:37.040
ah, it's a little easy.

58:37.040 --> 58:39.400
And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good.

58:39.400 --> 58:41.160
And I remember hearing that as a young comic,

58:41.160 --> 58:44.280
like ah, I'm getting this comedy lesson

58:44.280 --> 58:46.280
right here for these two titans.

58:46.320 --> 58:47.720
And so that was fun.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.000
Simple is key.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.160
So the easy is okay.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.480
That's such a weird,

58:51.480 --> 58:56.520
I think I remember reading or hearing Eminem say

58:56.520 --> 58:58.920
something about maybe the song Some Shape,

58:58.920 --> 59:00.480
one of the songs,

59:00.480 --> 59:02.080
he's like I knew it was gonna be good

59:02.080 --> 59:05.640
because it got like really repetitive

59:05.640 --> 59:07.280
and annoying very quickly,

59:07.280 --> 59:08.120
something like that.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.520
I mean that's the sort of the music equivalent

59:10.520 --> 59:12.920
of it's too easy.

59:12.920 --> 59:15.160
Like if it's like super catchy,

59:15.160 --> 59:19.760
as a musician, you might get very quickly bored of it.

59:19.760 --> 59:21.120
Or like as you're creating it,

59:21.120 --> 59:23.360
no, it's too easy.

59:23.360 --> 59:26.880
It's like there needs to be some more complexity to it.

59:26.880 --> 59:27.800
I like complexity,

59:27.800 --> 59:30.120
but the best guys who are the ones

59:30.120 --> 59:33.600
who make complex shit look simple.

59:33.600 --> 59:36.920
Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story

59:36.920 --> 59:37.760
where he's talking to his friends,

59:37.760 --> 59:39.600
his friend's like I'm gonna start a hat store.

59:39.600 --> 59:43.680
So he puts a sign out, says hats for sale, $12.

59:43.680 --> 59:46.360
And Ben Franklin looks at it and goes,

59:46.360 --> 59:47.600
well you don't need the $12

59:47.600 --> 59:49.120
because all they need to know

59:49.120 --> 59:50.120
is that you got hats for sale.

59:50.120 --> 59:51.760
He's like all right, so he loses the $12,

59:51.760 --> 59:53.200
makes a new sign, hats for sale.

59:53.200 --> 59:55.800
And he goes, you don't really need for sale

59:55.800 --> 59:58.640
because it's a business, people can put that together.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.200
So he just goes, all right, he makes a new sign,

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.280
it says hats.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.160
And then Ben Franklin's like,

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.400
you know, you don't really need the word hat.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.120
You can just put a picture of a hat.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.880
And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.440
and it like helped the business or something.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.480
This is like some old life's tale or whatever.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:14.960
But I think about that all the time when I'm writing.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.320
I thought this was going to like,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.640
there was no sign, it went like super like.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.240
Oh, maybe, maybe that could work too.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.680
What, like as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours,

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:29.120
I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.960
Like. Wow.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.800
Because you're. Now?

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.640
I'm getting nothing out of you.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.920
No, I'm, this is.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.760
All right, I can't tell.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.080
Oh, like emotion.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.560
Ew, you're tough not to read.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.720
I'm cold inside.

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.880
I mean, just the quickness you have.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.240
Obviously you're also a great standup comedian.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.440
What's your favorite medium to shine in?

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.120
So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.080
Thanks.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.520
You're often a podcast guest.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.080
Yeah.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.800
Which is always fun to listen to

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.680
how you're going to deal with the different people.

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.280
You're great on Rogan.

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.120
I'll say.

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.120
What, what, what do you enjoy most?

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.760
Podcasts are great because you can,

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.280
you can stretch out a little more.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.560
You can breathe a little, you know, with a standup set,

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.880
I like to be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.960
But podcasts are great because it's conversational.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.200
So you can be, it's almost like

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.160
you're being funny with your friends.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.440
Whereas the stage is like a, this is a piece.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.800
This is a presentation.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.280
But I think the, the podcast is great,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.040
but you don't get the reaction.

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.240
Unless the host is laughing,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.440
you can't hear the guy in his car in New Jersey

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.440
driving to work going, ah!

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.640
Every now and then I'll read a comment like,

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.160
I spit out my coffee when you said this.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.600
And I'm like, but it's not immediate.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.440
You want the immediate.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.520
So standup will always be number one,

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.600
but there's no better feeling

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.840
than killing in a room of people

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:46.840
who don't know who you are, strangers.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.240
You're in the middle of nowhere.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.440
You left your wife at home.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.560
You left your kids.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:51.760
You left your house.

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.240
You're in the middle of bumfuck dickville

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.760
and murdering for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.200
And they're slinging their beers and woo,

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.280
cheering you on and they carry you out

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.040
and you fuck some fat lady and you leave

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.520
and you get back to your hotel and you go,

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.400
holy shit, what was that?

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:10.600
No one will ever know about it.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.640
Just lost in the ether.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.440
That's the best feeling.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.480
Yeah.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.720
Killing in obscurity, as Bill Burr would say.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.280
Yeah, this is one of the things

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:22.320
that sucks about giving lectures,

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.800
like at universities or giving lectures in general

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.960
is when you look at the audience,

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.880
several hundred students,

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.160
they all have a bored look on their face.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.000
Yeah, of course.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.040
My face now probably looks bored,

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.360
but I'm actually excited to be talking to you.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:46.800
But there's something about a comedy called,

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.960
maybe it's the Contagion of Laughter,

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.720
but it gives people the freedom to just laugh,

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.120
to remove that facade of,

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:58.240
you don't have to pretend you don't care.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.680
If you care, you can show it

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.600
and you can have fun with it.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.120
Probably liquor helps a lot, too.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.280
It helps, for sure.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.920
But there is a, especially,

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.400
and that's why comedy I think is so popular right now,

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:12.520
because HR is up our ass.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:15.400
We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.240
What did I say on that interview?

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.720
Even people at offices are like,

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.120
I put something on Facebook in 1999

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.360
that was about fat tits that I liked.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.840
Should I get rid of that?

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.800
Even people say there's no cancel, whatever.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.960
There is something in the air right now

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.440
that wasn't there before.

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.560
It's the video, I'm a Karen,

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:36.640
I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.200
People rat on each other now, everybody's tattletaling

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.080
because they want the clicks.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.600
It's a horrible society we've crafted.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.920
But stand-up comedy gets you to come out,

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.240
and now people do it at stand-up shows, too, sadly,

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.440
but it gets you to come out and let that inhibition down.

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:54.800
Because we're all human, we've all had the fucked up thoughts,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.040
like, man, that guy's fat as shit.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.000
It doesn't mean you hate the guy,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.920
it doesn't mean you hate fat people,

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.280
it doesn't mean you're fat-shaming,

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.600
but you can't say that at the office.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.080
You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit.

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.960
You'll get fired for body-shaming.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.200
But at the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit,

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.960
and the crowd goes, he is fat as shit, ah!

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.200
And it's this weird cathartic thing,

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200
because all we do is tamp shit down.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.360
It's kind of like you ever meet a girl

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.320
who's like all prim and proper in the bedroom.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.400
She's like, put a lamp up my ass, ah!

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:20.720
You know, whatever it is.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.920
It's because we gotta get it out.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.960
We're all repressed in some way.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.800
So I guess what you're saying is comedy's important.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.880
Ha ha ha ha, yes!

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:33.280
Callback, well played, sir!

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.320
Yeah.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.000
What do you think about Austin?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.520
What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin?

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.840
We'll talk about LA and New York.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.360
What do you think about what Joe's trying to create there?

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.720
So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin,

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.440
I have this dream of,

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.720
it wouldn't be funny if I said this dream

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.840
of becoming a comedian.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.680
Oh, God.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.000
It's an audience, at least.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.280
Yeah, that's true.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.840
You know, I always said you can hear the music

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.680
in the distance.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.040
I have this dream around robotics

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.960
and artificial intelligence, whether it's a company,

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:05.240
whether it's something else that was just pulling me to.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.720
I actually wanted to move to San Francisco

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.000
and then all my friends in San Francisco said,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.040
no, it's the wrong place.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:10.880
Yeah.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.880
To, it's no, at this time, the cynicism there

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.400
is just not conducive to like taking big leaps

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:23.080
into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.640
And Austin was that with,

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:28.160
for me in particular with Elon Musk,

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.520
but also just the energy that everybody had,

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.560
including Joe, the excitement about the future.

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:37.120
I don't care if Austin burns to the ground

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.000
and it actually is a complete failure.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.000
Being excited about the future seems to be,

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.240
like optimism about the future seems to be the thing

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.400
that actually makes that future happen,

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.600
makes a great future happen.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.600
So it's always cool for me to see like Joe,

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.880
super excited about creating like a culture in Austin,

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.800
making it a comedy hub.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.720
Like I don't wanna overstate it,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.040
but I mean, I think he really believes

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.320
it'll be a very big place for comedy

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.520
in the United States in general, in the world.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:13.480
And so just even believing that, that's powerful.

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:14.320
I agree.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.160
You start to make it happen.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.720
That energy is there.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.200
Anyway, so, but that's for me from just an outsider

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.000
watching the fun of it.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.040
I should also mention for less of an outsider,

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:29.120
more insider in the martial arts world,

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:32.080
partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.240
like John Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B team,

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.360
all of those folks, those are, that might be gibberish to you,

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.560
but those are like some of the greatest grapplers

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.800
and martial artists of all time.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.920
So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.880
So the whole thing is just beautiful.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.880
Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene?

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.960
Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:00.840
One, I think Joe did do that to a degree,

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.120
like all these people, Segura lives there now,

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.480
a lot of comics live there.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.560
He's opening clubs, other clubs are opening.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:08.840
I think it's happening.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.280
That's the other thing is people go,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.320
everybody's moving to Austin.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:12.400
Austin's the new hub.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.800
And then they look at their watch and they go,

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.320
five minutes went by, nothing changed.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.080
It's gonna take years,

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.800
but everybody wants it now, now, now.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:23.840
What, Austin, there's no industry there.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.320
There's no Netflix, whatever.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.280
And you're like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.600
You can't just do this overnight.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.040
So people forget that.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.200
So it could happen huge, just give it some time.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.280
I mean, he's opening a club.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.120
I went and saw it.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.520
It's incredible.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.960
It's so perfect for comedy.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.920
It's every detail, it's incredible.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.000
But so it could happen still.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
I do think there's a little biting off

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.880
more than they can chew with Austin

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.840
because it's not that big.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.680
So like-

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.520
And it's spread out.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:53.360
I mean, yeah, it's not big.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:57.440
And the infrastructure's not quite there to support it.

01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.880
But it has a lot of, comparing from the tech side,

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.000
it has a lot of land to expand into.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.520
So it might become this-

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.360
That helps.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.840
Like you're basically establishing,

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.280
it's kind of like New York.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.800
You're establishing these whole neighborhoods

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.240
and you have the freedom to do that

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.440
because there's a lot of space on all sides.

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.720
Yes, okay, so that helps.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.660
So again, maybe some time.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.620
I do agree with that new hope

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.140
that's kind of built into human beings of like,

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:28.460
let's go to America.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.540
Let's go to the utopia.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.660
We even have it with space.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:32.100
Let's go to Mars.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.260
We gotta see what's over there.

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.820
And it's just red dusty bullshit,

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:37.260
but you still gotta go.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:39.300
So I'm with you on that about this new hope,

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:40.380
this new land.

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.740
And I think that is beautiful.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:43.940
And I think there's a lot of haters.

01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.060
I think there's a lot of naysayers

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.260
who hate change, who hate anything new.

01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.420
And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:53.020
That sucks, but blow me dickless.

01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:54.060
I'm trying something.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.380
You're a loser.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:57.100
Stop hating on me.

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:59.340
I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk, you know?

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.620
Yeah, it's hilarious.

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:03.660
I mean, there's some of the criticism on Austin.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.220
It's like a fad.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.820
A lot of people are really excited about Austin.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:10.780
And somehow that's like,

01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:12.580
it's like when Green Day became famous,

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.320
you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.380
But to me, like that's...

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.980
Austin was already a cool town.

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.340
Every comic five years ago was like,

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:23.940
ooh, I got Austin this week and I can't wait.

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.340
So it already had a buzz,

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.380
but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:33.100
The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:35.580
and now I get to visit it and then leave.

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.340
But I think it could still be

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:40.300
this comedy tech booming place.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.220
It just will take some time and people want it right now.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.460
Well, on the tech side,

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.780
it's already there.

01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:50.140
It's getting there very fast.

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.740
So I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.340
It's just a huge number of people

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.780
are moving there with jobs.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.300
You're already starting.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.980
And then the opportunities to launch new companies

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.060
is just incredible.

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.820
I guess it's not right now.

01:10:05.820 --> 01:10:09.140
It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing.

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:13.460
But it's an opportunity to just start to build shit

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:14.420
in a new place.

01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.260
And it's cool.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:17.180
It's kind of like, you know, go to Mars.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.540
They could get to start over.

01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.380
Yeah.

01:10:19.380 --> 01:10:20.740
And I like the hope aspect.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.700
I think that's huge for people.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:25.340
And I'm all for it.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.300
I hope it works out.

01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.420
I don't know if it will,

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.580
but I don't know anything about economies

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.060
and city planning and all that shit.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:35.940
So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works.

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.820
Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:38.660
Austin.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.580
Mars is, there's nothing there.

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:42.860
There's no vagina there.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:44.100
There's no food there.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:44.980
There's no water there.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:45.820
I don't know.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:48.140
I get space travel.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.060
I think it's important,

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:53.500
but I don't know Mars is really gonna move the needle.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.660
So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:01.540
and launching rockets into space?

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:04.180
I think it's all good because you could say,

01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:05.620
hey, we could just feed everybody.

01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:07.220
And I was like, yeah, that's true.

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.620
By the way, these guys give a ton of money

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.780
to like philanthropy shit that nobody cares about.

01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:12.900
By the way, you know, it's weird.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:17.740
Like he could feed Nigeria with pocket change of his.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.940
And you're like, well, maybe he has, you know,

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:21.780
like I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.380
he saved 6 million lives.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.180
But that's a reverse Holocaust by the way.

01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:27.300
That's pretty good.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:28.120
What have you done?

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.220
You're a barista.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.220
So, you know, I just think,

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.180
I think space travel is good because you learn

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:39.740
about the place you're living in from going to space.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.700
It kind of helps you learn about this more.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.380
You could say, what's the point of going to the South of there?

01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.620
But it does help, I think.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.860
Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.140
seems to be a way to develop like as a,

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.660
as almost like an accident,

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.100
as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.700
in a team of brilliant people.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.060
You develop things like the internet

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:02.580
and you could argue that the internet

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:04.140
maybe is not so good for society.

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:04.980
No, I'm just kidding.

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.020
That's good and bad.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.940
Yeah, but it's like a pull-up.

01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:09.860
You're trying to get your bicep going, but hey,

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.140
but before you know it, you got decent forearms,

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.460
but you weren't working on the forearms.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:15.860
You wanted to buy, but you got the fore.

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:18.620
And I think that's kind of what space travel is.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:22.500
I like how this like pivoted into a workout routine advice.

01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:25.100
I'm trying to get an analogy going here.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.540
All right, they work pretty well.

01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:27.380
I'll take it.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.220
All right.

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.420
What are your thoughts about,

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.380
since I'm a robotics person and be curious to see,

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.940
like what, do you think about the space at all?

01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:39.820
About, first of all, autonomous vehicles

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:44.820
with Tesla autopilot and Waymo self-driving car.

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.260
I'm not sure if you're familiar

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.660
with all the autonomous vehicles and so on.

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.980
So those are robots on wheels.

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.900
And then there's also legged robots.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.820
So next time you're in Austin,

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:56.460
you get to meet some of the legged robots

01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.260
that we've been working on.

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:04.660
And I find those kind of a fascinating way

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.660
to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers.

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:13.540
But also explore our own intelligence

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.260
and also explore our own,

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.820
like what makes us connect to other living beings,

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.980
whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:26.340
Like there's some magic there

01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.980
that's beyond just intelligence.

01:13:27.980 --> 01:13:30.460
And I, like when I have the robot dog,

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.500
there's some aspect to it that, I don't know,

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.100
brings me joy in a way that a dog does,

01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:38.380
in a way that a good friend does.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.740
Yeah, that's interesting.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:43.460
And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism,

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.420
like where I'm projecting my hopes for this,

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:50.980
what this thing is, but it's kind of built in.

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:52.620
I mean, it's just a source of joy.

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.500
Maybe it's connected to the fact

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:57.980
that there's just like a loneliness within all of us,

01:13:57.980 --> 01:13:58.820
within me.

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:03.380
And it's just nice to have other things in your life

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:05.900
that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.180
I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.140
Yeah, it is.

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:10.980
Plant goes a long way.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.500
You see a guy with plants in his apartment,

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.260
it changes the apartment, because they're alive.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:16.020
You gotta water them, you gotta put sun on them.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:17.620
So yeah, I think there's something there.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.740
And I think you can see people's reactions

01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:22.620
when you show them advanced technology,

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:25.780
like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:27.740
People are like, what the fuck?

01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.260
Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:33.820
or you wanna fuck them clearly, whatever it is.

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.500
But it does connect with you in some way.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:38.500
So I'm with you.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.020
And I think this is why I don't think robots will take over.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:41.860
You always hear that, robot,

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.860
they're making them too advanced.

01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.900
They're gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:50.260
If robots get at human emotions, that is scary

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.140
because they could get mad at us and kill us

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:53.540
and they're stronger and they don't need sleep,

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.660
they don't need food, they don't need water.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:56.940
They don't get jealous.

01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:01.380
But if they have emotions, then I think we can dominate them

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.220
because who knows emotions better than us?

01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.780
We've got thousands of years

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.260
of evolutionary emotional bullshit.

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:10.660
We can go, hey, robot, I heard your wife

01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.740
fucked that blackened decker, huh?

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.220
They're gonna crumble.

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:15.740
We can bully them.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.300
Emotionally manipulate robots?

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.260
Yes, that's when we'll win.

01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.660
Right now, they could kill us.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.500
They could just, we'd all die.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.260
Then we shoot them back, bing, bing, bing, bing.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.260
That's no good.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:28.620
But if they do get emotions, then we can go,

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.940
hey, you look like hell.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:30.980
What is that, a rusty bolt?

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.220
Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you loser.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.420
I think we can win if they do get emotions.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:37.340
This goes back to your father

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.580
to undercut you with a single word.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.420
You're right.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.260
Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:43.580
and then the robots will just,

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.620
you would say the exact thing

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.300
where the robot would be like, that son of a bitch.

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.340
And then it goes back to his hole

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.980
and just sits there miserable.

01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.900
Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.060
You can't get it up, yada, yada, yada.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.540
But I'm not worried about robots and I think self,

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.260
what do you think about the self-driving cars?

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.460
Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?

01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.380
Isn't that just progression of technology?

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.820
Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla,

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:12.660
for example.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:16.180
I have, I rode in the passenger and I drive it.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.220
Yeah, there's several stages in that.

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.900
I think the problem is way harder than people realize

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.380
and for quite a while,

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.340
it'll just make driving more pleasant.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.740
It'll make it less stressful.

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.700
It'll take over some of the boring bits for you

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:30.700
and make it easier.

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:31.940
There's something that happens actually

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.780
when the car is driving for you in the following way.

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.820
It's staying in the lane.

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.420
It's keeping distance to the car in front of you.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.460
Maybe it's changing lanes.

01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.540
It allows you to relax a little bit.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:45.380
Yes.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:48.140
You still have to be alert,

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.580
but you become like a passenger

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.340
and you get to take in the world.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.660
I mean, somehow that's more relaxing

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:58.660
without making you necessarily bored more.

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.900
It energizes you more.

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.660
So I just think it makes the driving experience

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.580
more pleasant,

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:05.260
but when you actually fully automate cars,

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.700
when you can just completely tune out

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:09.060
and start reading a book or go to sleep,

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:13.460
that might change society

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.660
in ways we don't even understand

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:16.660
because you'll have,

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:22.100
it'll probably change the nature of roads

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:22.940
because the cars,

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.780
because now you can be super productive

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:29.340
and so it no longer quite matters to you as much

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:32.020
how long it takes to get from point A to point B

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:34.380
because you're not wasting that time.

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.380
You just continue working.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.220
Yeah.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.020
It's like public transit that comes to you.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.100
Exactly.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:43.980
And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads

01:17:43.980 --> 01:17:45.380
and it will just change the nature

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.340
of how we get from point A to point B.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.180
I think you're right.

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.420
But then couple that also with the fact

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:53.500
that we seem to be more and more comfortable

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:55.220
existing in the digital world.

01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.060
Yeah.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.140
So like maybe we want to go outside more and more.

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.220
We'll just interact with each other virtually.

01:18:01.220 --> 01:18:02.380
And I don't mean Zoom meetings.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.380
I mean just in other ways

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:10.380
that's more fulfilling than a Zoom meeting.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.780
But then maybe not

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.380
because there's something deeply uncompelling

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.860
about Zoom meetings.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.740
Podcasts that are remote,

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.620
unless they're super information dense,

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.020
at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of suck.

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:24.860
They suck.

01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:25.680
There's no connection.

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:26.980
It goes back to the dog thing.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:28.900
With the Zoom, there's no connection.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:32.700
I don't understand why we're not even making eye contact.

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.780
I know.

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:34.740
But it's something there.

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.580
It's in the room.

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.400
There's pheromones.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.140
And that's like out of our understanding probably.

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:41.500
It's just some kind of weird biological.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.540
You ever have Cheerios in a bowl?

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:47.140
The Cheerios tend to go together.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.620
You see a cluster of Cheerios.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.300
They're never really hanging out on the other side.

01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:53.580
And that's kind of how people are in real life.

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.100
I wonder what the physics of that is.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:57.380
So they come together and they stick.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.260
There's so many with molecules.

01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.340
I don't know, I can't remember what it was.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:01.180
But it was fascinating.

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:02.300
And I think that's how people are.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:04.900
And I think you try to write a TV show

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:08.540
or craft a movie with your team.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:10.620
Zoom, nothing there.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:13.840
It's like phone sex versus penetration.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:16.180
One day you'll learn that.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:18.220
I know nothing of either the...

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.060
I look forward,

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.580
because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary,

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.900
then there's a show or something like that

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:26.980
that is really popular that I want to go watch.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.340
At least I can learn about that.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.100
I could send you some links.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:31.940
That could really-

01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.780
Oh, on the internet?

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:33.940
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.780
Yeah.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.020
But yeah, self-driving car,

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.300
I think it's just inevitable it's coming

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.140
and these truckers are gonna have to figure something out.

01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:44.900
Yeah, I mean, that's an under-understood industry,

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.980
actually, because there's a lot of trucking jobs.

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:49.820
Oh, yeah.

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.640
And people don't wanna...

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:52.420
Well, people don't wanna actually take them anymore

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.760
because it's such a difficult job.

01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:56.120
So it won't have,

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.280
or a lot of people believe it won't have

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.600
as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:02.800
There'll be other automation,

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:04.640
I think they'll have a huge impact.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.060
Yeah, for sure.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.280
I mean, you already see it in McDonald's.

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:08.520
You go to the beep, beep, beep.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.800
Why do you wanna get yelled at by the heavyset woman of color

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.440
for making the bad order

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.440
when you can just hit the screen?

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:19.040
But those interactions, I think, are human.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.020
I mean, that's part of life.

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.240
So it is scary taking away everything.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.040
How long till we're not fucking?

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.280
That's common, too.

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.100
Yeah.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.880
Then there's gonna have two types of people.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.940
Are you a fuck in real life,

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.360
or are you a digital fuck person?

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.200
Oh, I'm a digital.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.120
Oh, I like real fucking.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.440
Sorry, we can't date.

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.520
That's common.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.960
Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex,

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.400
which is like with genetic engineering,

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.960
you'll be able to specify a little bit of details.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:47.760
I talked to Jamie Marzo about that,

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.560
like where you can specify like,

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.360
it'll start with like,

01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:00.360
I want my child not to have like a high likelihood

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.040
of diabetes or something like that.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.760
And then you just get to specify like intelligence.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.120
You just get to specify those kinds of parameters

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.840
until you're like basically trying

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.960
to create a perfect human,

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.560
and you lose some of the magic or the flaws

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.720
that make us who we are.

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:14.680
Yes.

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:19.680
And you know, I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans,

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.640
like, so let me give you some information.

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.480
Lay it off, everybody.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:25.320
I'm sure.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.160
Break it down.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.480
I'm sure you researched this thoroughly,

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.480
but a male of the human species, the homo sapien,

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:41.160
produces 500 billion sperm cells in a lifetime.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.440
So that's all, some more than others.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.960
That's all uniquely, genetically unique humans

01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.800
that you could produce.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.680
So even across those 500 billion, you can select.

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.480
And so-

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:58.200
What do you mean, like abort some or-

01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.400
No, you can choose which of them you want.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.080
I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.040
that are there, like all the possible,

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:07.960
like you won the race.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.800
Yes.

01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.680
Shocking.

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.000
Did you actually win out of all the 500 billion?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.600
You have to imagine what the competition was.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.920
Oh, just tarts all day long, handicap.

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.360
Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm or like,

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.160
I think a lot of it is timing and luck,

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.000
is what it seems like.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.160
There's actual papers on this,

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.920
and I've actually been reading them.

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:31.920
I hope so.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.080
So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:34.920
Okay.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.240
There's a timing thing.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.960
So you were just lucky.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.480
All right, I believe that.

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.080
So it's interesting to think about like,

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:47.040
once you're able to specify some parameters

01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:49.280
of what your child is like,

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.280
how that changes the nature of even just like

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.800
the intimacy of two humans getting together

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:02.360
and making, creating together a child.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.200
Yeah.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.160
I mean, it changes it.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.080
It's almost like, I don't know,

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:10.760
it becomes like a factory line of some kind.

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:12.960
If you don't meet naturally.

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:14.600
Yeah, if you don't meet naturally,

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.680
and then you get to optimize your child,

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.000
then it's something like,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.400
you have to consider utilitarian type of things

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.520
like what's good for society,

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.320
and it'll probably be regulation

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.560
about what kind of children you can have and not.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.240
Like your child cannot have an IQ below this

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.360
or above this or something like that.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.760
Your child cannot.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:39.200
Yeah, we already kind of do that with VIP clubs.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.880
Like, hey, you're kind of ugly,

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.280
or women go, hey, he's not tall enough.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.560
We kind of do it a little, especially sexually.

01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.400
Yeah, we do.

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.680
Can't get on the roller coaster,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:50.520
if you're this short, whatever it is.

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.720
We do it in some capacity.

01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.080
But here, this would be like fully transparent

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.080
and to a degree that it's hard to imagine.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.000
Like the way we currently do it,

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.760
you can at least get around it.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.600
Yes.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:07.040
You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster,

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.240
even if you're short.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:11.320
Right, or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:12.720
You know, there's other ways.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:16.680
At the risk of asking the totally wrong person

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.640
this question, what advice would you give

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.120
to young people today in high school and college

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:26.840
about how to have a successful career

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.680
or career they're proud of,

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.960
or maybe have a life that they're proud of?

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.400
Ooh.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.320
Well, first of all, you gotta be,

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:35.840
you gotta want a life you're proud of.

01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:38.440
Not everybody has any integrity.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.560
A lot of people just want short money.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.720
I wanna feel good, look good right now.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.560
I wanna do Molly.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.400
Boom, I'll feel good, you know?

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.160
But you should space it out.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.920
You should, it's almost like saving money

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.240
so you can use it later.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.400
Nobody wants to save money.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.040
What do they say, like 11% of America

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.960
actually has money saved?

01:24:57.960 --> 01:24:59.360
$1,000 or some shit?

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.520
It's wildly low.

01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.920
Everybody wants it now, now.

01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.160
What do you call it, immediate gratification.

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.280
I think the key to happiness and satisfaction

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.480
is working for something.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.920
Even if it's, it's like a baby.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.600
If you could have a baby in five minutes,

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.720
if a woman, you got a, you jizzed in her

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.320
and she had a baby, oh, five minutes, boom.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.120
Newborn, healthy.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.800
I think you'd be more likely to throw it away

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.200
if you could make it that quick.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.520
It's the fact that you spent nine months

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.200
backbreaking the labor, the lactating,

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:36.040
the ripped placenta and the hymen or whatever the fuck.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.600
That's what makes you love it.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.840
And I think it's the same with comedy

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.440
or making money or whatever.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.720
Look at these kids who like child stars.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.040
They all become heroin addicts at like 22

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:48.400
because they've just, their sensors are burned out.

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.360
Their pleasure sensors, you didn't have to earn it.

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.720
I think earning it is a big part of life

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.600
and always try to do better, try to do more,

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.160
try to learn new things.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:00.720
Hey, I'm bored, life sucks.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.600
Play the piano then, you chooch.

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.040
But you won't do it because it takes effort

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.680
and failure and all that.

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:08.400
But that's the good part.

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.280
And I know it's hard to see.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.800
So I think that's a good key to life

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:16.000
is work hard at something you care about

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.640
and then love the result.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.760
The hard work, the journey is actually way more important

01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.960
than just getting something.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:26.320
Everybody wants to go on Amazon, I got a package.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:28.640
Then you feel good for 10 seconds and,

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:29.800
all right, let's go on Amazon again.

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.800
And then you just, it's just a dumb cycle

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.560
of you being disgusting and gluttonous.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.000
So work for it.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.440
Everybody wants to take steroids

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:39.960
and just, boop, I'm buff.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.880
Why'd you point at me?

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.720
Well, I'm just saying.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.560
Because I'm Russian or what?

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.120
Well, I saw the Icarus.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:45.960
Yeah.

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.360
But no, I'm not saying you're on roids.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:48.840
I'm just, you'd be way bigger.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:52.600
But I'm just saying, you know, work for something.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.600
And then I would also, young people, eat shit early.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.800
Eat shit early.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.800
I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.360
And he had an out early, but he tried to get by

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.920
and he tried to ride it.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.240
And it all came crumbling down.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.440
But if he had eaten early, like, yeah, I fucked up.

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.440
I did that, whatever it was,

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:16.520
he would have just kind of been shit on for a month

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.560
and then it would have gone away.

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:20.000
But now it's his whole identity and that sucks.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.080
So eat shit early.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:23.280
And I know it's hard to see, what do you mean early?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.560
I'm in the present.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.760
But look ahead, look back.

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.320
This time will pass.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.680
I mean, look at high school.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.320
High school was the biggest thing in our lives.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.600
Oh my God, this exam.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:33.960
Susie Q hates me.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:35.360
The football player beat me up.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.640
Oh, I'll never recover.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:37.720
Now you don't even think about high school.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.320
It's just a blip in your dumb life, you know?

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.400
And that's what this is now.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.560
This will just be a blip.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.200
So remember that and work towards something

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.520
and work hard and care about the result.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.160
If the result isn't good, try it again.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.840
And failure is not always bad.

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.720
Failure, we look at failure as this end all be all.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.840
My life's over, I failed.

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.080
But failure is really just learning.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:01.920
So that's something.

01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:06.680
So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.760
Yes.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.840
All right, Mark Norman.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.000
Eat ass.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.080
That escalated quickly.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.040
All right, I have a list of random questions for you.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.480
What activities make you lose track of time?

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:20.320
Oh.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.280
Have that, go into that zone.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.960
You have this happiness contaminated by you

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.800
that you just truly enjoy.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.680
Yeah, I think good conversation.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.360
I'll sit at the Comedy Cellar with friends,

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.680
maybe a little whiskey's flowing.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.680
And when you're really just vibing and inhibiting.

01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:42.520
You can do it.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.360
What is it?

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.680
Inhibited. Inhibited.

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:45.840
Uninhibited. Uninhibited.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.560
When you're just vibing and you're uninhibited

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.520
and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.480
and you're not worried, am I seeming cool right now?

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.800
Am I seeming likable?

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.000
When you're just you 100% and it's all coming out of you

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.040
and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.240
and you feel that excitement.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:00.800
Oh, they're talking, but I wanna say my thing.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.560
And you get all keyed up.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:03.400
I love that.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.480
And I look at my watch and I'm like,

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.960
fuck, it's three in the morning.

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.720
We've been talking for five hours.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.040
So I love that.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:10.840
That makes the time fly by.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.320
Also, I bought, speaking of self-driving cars,

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.320
I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.960
and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.520
and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.760
Bucket of bolts.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.600
Yeah.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.840
You and Tom Waits are poets.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:32.400
Have you taken like a long trip anywhere,

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.960
like road trip in your life or with this BMW?

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:36.800
Not with it.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.400
It's pretty new, but I will.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.760
It's a new 1970s.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.040
Yeah, it's new to me.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.000
And it just, it goes in the phase of everything

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:45.840
we're doing now.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:46.660
Everything is digital.

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:47.500
Everything is automated.

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.860
Everything is hands off.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.980
Everything is delivered.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.700
And this is the most hands-on thing in the world.

01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:54.140
And I am dialed in, man.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.220
I got the tachometer.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:56.260
I keep an eye on that.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:58.420
Oh, I made, I put the wrong gear in, shit.

01:29:58.420 --> 01:29:59.300
Oh, it's about to stall.

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:00.900
Put some gas, put some clutch.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:05.900
And it's all just brain power and staying in focus

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.060
and all that.

01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.460
And it's the opposite of tweeting and texting

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:11.780
and watching porn or whatever.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:14.100
So I almost needed that in my life.

01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.860
So I bought this car just to have this little exercise.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:21.100
I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out

01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.100
random questions I wrote on you that are completely,

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:25.860
they're like completely insane.

01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:27.740
I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:29.100
Bring it on, baby.

01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:32.540
This would be edited down to five minutes.

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.940
If everyone on earth disappeared and it was just you left,

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.660
what would your days look like?

01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:40.780
What would you do?

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.500
That's tough, because I'm already an introvert

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:45.500
and I try to avoid people mostly.

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:50.500
Like I like a one-on-one, but crowds and all that is tough.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.340
So.

01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:52.580
So basically unchanged.

01:30:52.580 --> 01:30:53.900
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:56.300
But then that's the irony is I would be so sad

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:57.220
to not talk to anybody.

01:30:57.220 --> 01:30:59.740
So it's this weird, bittersweet thing,

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.940
but I don't know what I would do, man.

01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:03.940
I guess it's kind of like when you're hungover,

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:07.340
you just go into the primal survival mode.

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:08.660
I gotta get food.

01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.700
I need water.

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:10.780
I'm horny.

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.740
Jerk off.

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.020
You just go, you're not like playing the piano

01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.820
or painting or at the gym.

01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.260
So I think I would just go into urges, man.

01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:21.300
Primal urges.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.460
Find food.

01:31:22.460 --> 01:31:24.060
Store food.

01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:24.900
Am I safe?

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.340
Make weapons.

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.780
Build a shelter that I can't get attacked in.

01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.340
I would go all survival mode.

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.180
And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not,

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:37.020
there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring.

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:40.500
And maybe somehow get a vehicle

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.860
and I would try to expand and that would be it.

01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:45.180
And maybe I'd journal.

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:49.260
Exploring what to try to find new experiences.

01:31:49.260 --> 01:31:51.300
New life, if there's other,

01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:53.180
maybe there is another guy out there.

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:55.700
Oh, so always there's a possibility.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.860
Yeah, hope.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.700
Hope.

01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:58.900
And then maybe there's a better place I could live.

01:31:58.900 --> 01:31:59.820
Let's find that.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.060
And then moving on.

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.140
Maybe there's more food over here.

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.500
So yeah, the hope would drive me.

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.220
But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also.

01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:09.820
So what you're saying is you really want other people

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.660
to be there so you can hide from them.

01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.420
Yes, yes.

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:14.980
Well said.

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:17.820
All right, what's an item on your bucket list

01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:19.180
that you haven't done yet?

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.620
Think about something you'd be very upset if you died

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.700
and you haven't done.

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:27.260
Well, I'm terrified of having kids.

01:32:27.260 --> 01:32:28.780
Just because I'm a child myself

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:31.900
and I'm selfish and lazy in a way.

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:34.100
So kids are like, this is your whole life now.

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:34.940
This is it.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:35.860
You gotta not let this thing die.

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:36.700
You gotta love it.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:37.940
You gotta raise it.

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:39.500
So kids scare the shit out of me.

01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:42.220
But I also feel like if I don't have them,

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:43.820
I'll regret it.

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.820
Well, you've seen so many people like you

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:48.940
who are fundamentally changed by kids.

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:53.940
Like it's a source of, like a deep source of happiness

01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:55.860
even though you didn't anticipate it.

01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.260
Yeah.

01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:59.980
So you penciled it into your bucket list.

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.820
Yes, yes.

01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:02.660
It might be on there.

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.620
Okay.

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:04.460
You want kids?

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:06.900
Yeah, well, I want kids.

01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:08.140
I wanna get married.

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:10.100
I wanna have kids.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:13.940
I kind of, I don't like choice.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:15.660
So in the following way,

01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:18.540
like I appreciate the value of scarcity

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:19.580
and the power of scarcity.

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:22.140
Like I don't like the modern dating culture.

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.660
It's not some religious thing, whatever.

01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:27.220
I just like one girl for a long time

01:33:27.220 --> 01:33:28.660
or at least swinging for that always.

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:30.220
Like swinging for the fences.

01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:31.780
But you could be swinging right now.

01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:32.620
I mean, you're-

01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:34.020
That's a different use of the word swinging.

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:34.860
Sure, sure.

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:35.980
But I'm saying you could be clear.

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:36.820
You look great.

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:37.660
You're handsome.

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:38.940
Muscular.

01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:39.780
Thank you.

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:40.620
You get the job done.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.460
So I feel like you wouldn't leave

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.580
without an orgasm on her.

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:43.420
Yeah.

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:45.420
But I just like to, you know, about furries,

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:47.420
I like to dress up as animals

01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:49.340
and I just have trouble finding others

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.180
who like the same-

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.020
They're up there.

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.620
I could show you some chat rooms.

01:33:52.620 --> 01:33:54.060
You're also my coach for the internet.

01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:54.900
Okay.

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:57.940
What are you most afraid of?

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:01.900
I guess on Unlived Life.

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:07.580
I'm always a big fan growing up of like wild guys.

01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.100
Like these Teddy Roosevelts who would go out

01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:14.460
and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys.

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:17.460
I was obsessed with the Hunter S. Thompson types.

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:21.900
And look, this is what I love about guys like,

01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.500
who's a good example?

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.700
Like Hemingway.

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:26.340
Hemingway was the manliest guy.

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.060
He had the rifle and the elephant gun

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.420
and the whiskey and the writing

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.620
and the women and the fist fights.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.860
But people forget that the other side of that coin

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.180
is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping.

01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:37.700
I'm sure he was lonely as fuck.

01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.260
I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.620
I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake.

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:42.860
So obviously he was dealing with something.

01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:46.660
So the key to me is having this adventurous life,

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:48.940
living to the fullest, doing crazy shit,

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.460
scaring yourself, but also not killing yourself.

01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:53.980
Like also not hating,

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:56.060
because I used to party a lot, hard.

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.740
I used to bang a lot of gals.

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:02.220
And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now,

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:04.780
or you got herpes, or you're hungover,

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:06.500
or your mom is like, where are you?

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.500
You never call me anymore.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.660
You're like, oh, my mom, my father.

01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:10.820
Let ties go with my mom.

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:11.820
I gotta connect.

01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:14.700
So there's a horrible side to the party animal.

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:18.380
The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty.

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.100
I mean, he's already weird looking,

01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.100
but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living,

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.300
but there's another side of that coin.

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:28.660
And I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy,

01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:32.580
awesome, badass life and also having some,

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.660
you know, meaning and a little bit of a,

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:38.180
what's the word?

01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.660
Not just not killing yourself, not going sad,

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:41.980
not being depressed.

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:44.820
There's a medium there, a sweet spot.

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:45.780
Does that make sense?

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:46.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:51.620
So taking big leaps and having way,

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:53.020
grabbing life by the balls,

01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:54.620
but at the same time not crushing the balls

01:35:54.620 --> 01:35:56.460
that metaphor work at all.

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.300
Perfect.

01:35:57.300 --> 01:35:59.100
Evil Knievel, we all know him.

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:00.740
What a badass, fearless.

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:02.180
Oh man, what a cool dude.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:03.860
He's got balls of steel,

01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:05.980
but he also lived like the back half of his life

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:08.820
in a fucking, you know, Barca lounger

01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:10.260
where his legs were made of steel

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:13.260
and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't work.

01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:15.620
So, you know what I mean?

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.220
You've gotta have a balance,

01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.380
but you still want the balance.

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:20.940
I'm willing to take a little bit of shit

01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:23.580
for a little bit of fun,

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:26.020
but you don't wanna go too hard.

01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.220
You gotta still risk it.

01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:30.500
I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.340
Yeah.

01:36:31.380 --> 01:36:32.220
Quite a ride.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.300
Quite a ride.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.900
What small act of kindness were you once shown

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:38.260
that you will never forget?

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:41.500
Wow, that's a great question.

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.020
I just wrote these for the guinea pig.

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:45.860
You're the guinea pig.

01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:46.700
That's great.

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.540
That's a keeper.

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:48.380
Keep that question.

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.260
This is where like workshopping questions are.

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:51.380
All right, I'll take it.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.500
Now you're open-biking.

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:53.340
Yeah.

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:54.180
This is your version.

01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.180
Let's see.

01:36:56.180 --> 01:36:57.580
There's a couple of ladies in high school

01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.940
who were kind enough to hand job me.

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.900
That was nice.

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:04.780
I don't think women know how much that means to us.

01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:06.780
Women are like, oh, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:07.620
And you're like, I know,

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:10.060
but if you just gave me a hand job,

01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:10.900
it would make my world.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:13.580
It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved.

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.740
See, most people mention like a math teacher

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:17.740
in middle school that would inspire them

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:19.140
to get into science.

01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:21.220
You give a shout out to the-

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:22.500
Well, that's part of it.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.380
That's not the nicest,

01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.180
but I'm just saying that goes a long way.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:26.140
All right.

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:26.980
Let's see.

01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:27.820
Kindness.

01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:29.220
That's a great question.

01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:32.340
I want to give you a good answer.

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:35.100
I got lost when I was like six.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.820
I was walking around my dad

01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:38.740
and I zoned out and went away.

01:37:38.740 --> 01:37:40.580
And next thing you know,

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:41.540
I don't know where I am.

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.380
I'm in a neighborhood.

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:45.940
This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere

01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:47.900
and he goes, come inside.

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.900
And he tried to call my parents and nothing came of it.

01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.700
Eventually they found me after like nine hours.

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:56.300
Cops were there, the FBI's out there,

01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:57.980
fucking helicopters.

01:37:57.980 --> 01:37:58.820
And I guess, you know,

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:01.340
that's the nicest old guy took me in for a couple hours

01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.300
and just sat me down and kept me safe.

01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.140
That's something.

01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:06.980
Yeah.

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:08.300
Oh, how about Enis?

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.420
My transvestite nanny.

01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.380
Very kind.

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:15.420
He, did you hear about this?

01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:16.260
No.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:17.100
Okay.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:18.020
We had this transvestite nanny.

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:19.260
He was like a drag queen,

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.100
but it was in the 90s.

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:20.940
So it was weird.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:21.900
It was new.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:25.500
And my bike got stolen and he,

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.340
you know, my parents are like,

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:27.160
what are you going to do?

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.740
They're poor kids, you know?

01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.460
And he was like, fuck it.

01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:31.300
Let's, we're going to go get that bike.

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.860
And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels,

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:35.020
big black guy.

01:38:35.020 --> 01:38:38.220
And I'm like, ah, what are you going to do?

01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:39.060
You know, it's gone.

01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.380
And he's like, no, we're going to go get it.

01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:44.060
So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood,

01:38:44.060 --> 01:38:46.260
saw the kids, fuck with the bike, you know,

01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:48.140
five street toughs.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:51.060
And he goes, all right, you want to come out

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.060
or should I just do this?

01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:53.140
And I was like, you do it.

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:53.960
I'm terrified.

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.020
What are you crazy?

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:59.980
And he got out of the van in full, you know, heels and wig.

01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:01.940
And he went up to these guys and they went off.

01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.620
Oh my God, look at this fucking guy,

01:39:03.620 --> 01:39:05.180
homo-fag and all this shit.

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.580
You know, it's the nineties.

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.620
And he just stared at them long enough

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:10.980
to where they were kind of like, all right,

01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.700
well, I guess we're going to fight you now.

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:14.940
And he goes, that's not your bike.

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.560
And they go, what are you going to do about it?

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:18.780
And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike

01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:19.860
and they didn't do anything.

01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.460
And he just picked it up and said, that's what I thought.

01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:25.340
Put the bike over his shoulder, slid the van door open,

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.180
threw the bike in and we drove off.

01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:29.580
Somebody stuck up for you.

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:33.100
Yeah, I mean, he could have got, I mean, they had tools.

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.860
They could have fucking tuned him up two seconds.

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:39.020
That actually like takes courage.

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:41.260
Oh yeah, real courage.

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:45.100
And then that, the reason you do an act like that

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:48.820
is that makes a kid like you feel like

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.100
there's somebody on your side.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.220
Yes. That's powerful.

01:39:51.220 --> 01:39:52.780
Someone on your side is big.

01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:53.620
Is big.

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.900
That goes a long way.

01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.860
Especially when they have the risk

01:39:57.860 --> 01:40:00.140
of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.060
or whatever it is.

01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:05.440
Now we're going to get philosophical,

01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.580
maybe a little bit emotional.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:12.740
Would you rather lose all your old memories

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.120
or never be able to make new ones?

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.100
It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer,

01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:22.820
make new ones.

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.580
But don't you think all the shitty things

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:25.940
that happened to you?

01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:27.700
Oh, so my hard drive is wipe clean.

01:40:27.700 --> 01:40:30.780
It's not, is it memories or is it

01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:34.220
how every memory affected me too?

01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:35.740
I mean, this is a very-

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.820
Or do they go hand in hand?

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:39.380
I think the reality about memories

01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.740
is you replay them often.

01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.580
You go back to them even when you're not aware of it.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.860
You really go, you go back often like that.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.300
And they change, you change them too.

01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.500
Yeah, you change them to suit

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.140
your understanding of the world.

01:40:52.140 --> 01:40:52.980
Yes.

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:57.460
And so the dark view you have,

01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.900
both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world

01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:04.340
is so deeply grounded in the memories

01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.820
that you're basically, I would say,

01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:07.420
if you erase all memories,

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.860
I think you're really starting over

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.780
with maybe the wisdom of how the world works,

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:18.420
but not so much your personality is gone.

01:41:18.420 --> 01:41:19.620
You would really,

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.820
it'd be interesting how your comedy would change.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.500
Maybe you would have a good sense of timing.

01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:30.500
You have a good sense of the writing process maybe,

01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.180
but like-

01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:34.420
No, you're making some good points,

01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.260
but let me ask you this.

01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:37.780
Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:42.980
Now, I wipe the memory or I keep my old memories.

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.620
Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.060
I just won't remember that?

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.020
Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:50.860
Okay.

01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:51.680
You'll get to enjoy it.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.020
Can I look at a photo of it?

01:41:54.980 --> 01:41:55.820
Yes.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:56.860
But I was, what the hell is this?

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.700
Yeah, exactly.

01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.980
Oh, fascinating.

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.940
It's exact, the rules are pretty simple.

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:02.780
Yeah.

01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:04.300
I think everyone knows how the rules go.

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.660
So you would, yeah, so what-

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:08.540
Well, I was gonna say start new ones,

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.380
but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them.

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.200
That's what you're saying.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.080
So I guess I'd keep them.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:17.840
Cause I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:18.680
Yeah.

01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:21.000
And let's be honest, how many years do you have left?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:21.840
I know, right?

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:22.680
I got eights.

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.440
Is it better to have loved?

01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:27.000
Okay, this question is ridiculous.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.160
Is it better to have loved than lost

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.600
or to have never loved at all?

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:34.560
It sounds cliche, but there's a question.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.920
Definitely better to loss.

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.440
So you enjoy the ups and downs?

01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:39.960
Yeah, that's life.

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.280
Sun and rain, baby.

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:47.600
I kind of like both, the whole thing, the loss.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:49.120
Every time you lose something,

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.800
it really makes you distinctly realize

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.240
how much you valued it.

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:55.080
Yes.

01:42:55.080 --> 01:43:00.080
Like when I'm sad, like when I'm feeling alone

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.240
and I'm sitting there alone at home

01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.720
and I wish I could hang out with somebody,

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.560
that's like a realization how awesome people are.

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:11.680
Yeah.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.560
So it's like the missing, the, yeah.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.320
We don't have a lot of that in life anymore

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.360
because we can have anything we want immediately.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.720
So the missing has gone away,

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:25.320
which again drives down the joy of having it.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:28.480
So I think you're right, you need both.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.200
So like you said, you have a condition

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.360
that, a terminal condition, not many years left.

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.720
Do you think about your mortality?

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.800
Do you think about that?

01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.760
All day, every day.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.600
Are you afraid?

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.440
Not afraid, because it's inevitable.

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.480
So it's more like, how are we gonna handle this?

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.760
It's like the winter is coming,

01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:50.280
let's stock up on some fucking nuts.

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.680
But the existential nature of it,

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.520
like the fact that this ride ends,

01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.480
like what the hell are you doing any of this for?

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.520
Like, is it your-

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:58.560
Satisfaction, happiness.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.520
Short term, but like there is a presumption there

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:04.400
that it kind of goes on forever.

01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:07.320
I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.240
Your brain almost shuts it down.

01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:15.400
There's some kind of protective switch that just goes off.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:19.360
I mean, that's why the Stoics encourage people

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:20.680
to meditate on death,

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:24.120
because it somehow reorganizes your priorities.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.240
It helps you like, holy shit,

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.880
this ends make the most of the day.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.000
It's just a nice thing,

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.240
but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.160
Little things too, people go like,

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.720
oh, we got a layover between our flights.

01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.440
It's an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour?

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.560
It's like, what do you mean, what are you gonna do for an hour?

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:44.280
You're gonna kill an hour, let's kill,

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:46.360
how are we gonna kill this hour?

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:47.400
This is part of your life.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.240
You're just trying to get rid of it,

01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.200
you're just trying to kill it.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.240
That always blew my mind.

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.880
Like, hey, fuck it, let's hit the airport bar.

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:57.160
Let's get a candy bar or something, anything with bar.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.520
But it's just, you gotta live.

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.000
I hate this, like, how are we gonna burn?

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.200
Oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes,

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.040
what are we gonna do?

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:07.640
Well, we got 15 minutes, the world is our oyster.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.280
Yeah, make the most of it.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.920
And like you said, in modern day,

01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:13.800
actually the boredom is a gift.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.480
Like, when you're waiting for something, that's a gift.

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.440
You get to be with your thoughts.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.400
Yeah.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.760
Those are the same thoughts you'll have

01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:24.440
when you're in your deathbed.

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.720
There won't be, you won't be scrolling TikTok

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:29.760
on your deathbed.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.800
I hope not, Jesus.

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.240
You'll be a lot more, actually, maybe you would be.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.240
What a sad existence.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.360
Because it would be a good, like,

01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.200
content creators would be like, ooh, I'm dying,

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.360
this would be good content.

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.040
Yeah, I wanna be able to film the exact moment,

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.560
it goes, beep.

01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:46.600
Like last words, I wonder what my last words will be.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:47.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.920
It's a good way to end the account with a bang.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.360
Yep, I like that.

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.640
Well, you know, have you ever seen that meme

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:54.680
where the old guy in bed, he goes,

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.520
I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies.

01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.520
It's so true.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.960
It could be the future.

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.960
What do you think is the meaning of life?

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.080
I don't think there is one.

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:07.840
Everybody always throws that out there.

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.680
There isn't a meaning.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.120
I think we're here, we're lucky to be here.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.080
I think there's no afterlife, there's no heaven.

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.080
That's all shit we tell ourselves to feel better.

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.520
And I think you gotta just, it's like saying,

01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:23.280
what is the meaning of this food I made?

01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:25.080
Well, it's just, you enjoy the food,

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:26.560
you try to get the most out of it.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:30.040
You built the food, you prepared it.

01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:35.040
So just get what you can out of it, don't die,

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.520
and try to make it last as long as possible.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:42.480
Yeah, but you look at Earth, it's like four billion years old

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.480
and life started early on, like simple cell bacterial life,

01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:51.160
like one billion years in, and then it started like

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:54.800
having lots of aggressive interaction.

01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:56.440
Eventually there's predator and prey

01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:59.240
and then there's sex, lots of sex, lots of sex,

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:00.200
lots of violence.

01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.440
Oh yeah.

01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:03.760
And then through natural selection,

01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:07.480
there's just the whole evolutionary process of animals

01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.240
that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten murdered

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.080
and all that kind of stuff.

01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:14.400
And it's somehow led to human civilization.

01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:17.120
We're super busy trying to create things

01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:19.920
and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.640
Just always creating something new.

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.760
It feels like it's tending towards something.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:28.520
It's not dying.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:31.760
If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.640
So it's kind of, you think you're cheating death

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.640
in a subconscious way, I think.

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:38.520
Right, you know who Ernest Becker is?

01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:39.600
I've heard the name.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.040
It's a book called Denial of Death,

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.280
this idea that if you don't acknowledge...

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.280
What's on my show?

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:49.440
Girls love it.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.360
Like Dostoevsky, no, I'm just saying,

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.920
you want to bring Tolstoy to Dostoevsky.

01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.120
Russian literature, it's back to norm.

01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.720
It's good to bring to...

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:02.400
Because no American has read any Russian literature,

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.560
but they all appreciate it if you bring it.

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.840
And it's not like they're going to ask you

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:08.000
any legitimate questions because they haven't read it.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.680
So you can always pretend like you've read it.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:12.280
So it's a little dense.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.320
Can we get a shortened version?

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.160
Cliff notes.

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:18.360
Yes, or make a movie with Ben Stiller

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.280
that I can just go, oh, this is based on,

01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:23.280
what is it, Life and Death?

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.120
No, what's the one?

01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:24.960
War and Peace.

01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:26.600
War and Peace, yeah.

01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:28.800
Yeah, so Ernest Becker's theory,

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.240
and there's this whole terror management theory

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.560
that basically says that our terror of death,

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.120
our fear of death is one of the central creative forces

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:40.360
of the human condition.

01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:43.320
It's the reason we're trying to cheat death.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.960
We're trying to delude ourselves

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.600
that somehow we can become immortal through our art.

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.720
That's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:52.400
because you think your special

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:54.600
will outlive all of human civilization.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.360
You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.600
That could go away tomorrow.

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:00.280
That can go away tomorrow.

01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:01.520
All of this can go away.

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:05.200
So I'm truly grateful, Mr. Mark Norman,

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.040
that you would spend your very valuable time with me today,

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.480
even though it could all go away.

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.520
This could be the last day of our lives,

01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:16.280
and won't you be quite upset this is how you spent it?

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.880
Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I?

01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:20.160
You're like Harvey Weinstein here.

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.320
You cleared me up, but now I feel fucked.

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.080
Just wait what we have ready for you

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.440
after the podcast is over.

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.840
All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today.

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.480
Thank you, it was great.

01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:32.320
Comedy.

01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:35.000
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.160

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.680
from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter,

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.880
which you should definitely follow because it's hilarious.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.400
The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas

01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:53.400
is you know it was re-gifted.

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:58.320
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
