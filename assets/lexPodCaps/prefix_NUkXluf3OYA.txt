00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
The following is a conversation with Michael Malus.

00:03.360 --> 00:08.400
This is a special holiday episode, and it is made extra special because it's announcing

00:08.400 --> 00:14.360
the release of Michael's new book called The White Pill, A Tale of Good and Evil.

00:14.360 --> 00:19.180
Michael and I disagree on a lot of ideas in politics and philosophy, and we have a lot

00:19.180 --> 00:24.800
of fun disagreeing, but there's no question that he has a deep love for humanity and puts

00:24.960 --> 00:30.520
heart and soul into his work, especially into this heart-wrenching, deeply personal book.

00:30.520 --> 00:37.000
So I ask that you support him by buying it at whitepillbook.com that should hopefully

00:37.000 --> 00:39.300
forward to the Amazon page.

00:39.300 --> 00:45.960
As always, we each dressed up in a ridiculous outfit without coordinating for the chaos

00:45.960 --> 00:49.200
that makes life so damn interesting.

00:49.200 --> 00:55.160
This episode is full of humor, darkness, and love, which is the best way to celebrate

00:55.160 --> 00:57.040
the holidays.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.960
This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:02.240 --> 01:08.800
And now, dear friends, here's Michael Malus.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.920
We probably should have coordinated this better, shouldn't we?

01:10.920 --> 01:11.920
Yeah.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
I think so.

01:12.920 --> 01:18.920
Have you, since this is a Christmas special, a holiday special, have you been a good or

01:18.920 --> 01:20.960
a bad boy, Michael, this year?

01:20.960 --> 01:22.120
Well, that's interesting.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.720
One of the people in the book, Granville Hicks, his autobiography starts with, I was a good

01:26.720 --> 01:29.280
boy and he wasn't a very good boy.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.040
On a scale of one to 10.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.320
I'm trying to think of what bad things I've done.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.320
Oh, okay.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
There's that.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
Okay.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.320
Wait.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.320
That's not, that was, that was not a good question.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.320
That's all right.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.320
I would say nine.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
Nine?

01:43.320 --> 01:44.320
Yeah.

01:44.320 --> 01:45.320
I try to do the right thing.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.320
Okay.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.320
What about you?

01:47.320 --> 01:48.320
Is it going to be a one or zero?

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
Yeah.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.720
No, I'm extremely self-critical.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.720
I pushed the zero.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.720
Okay.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.720
I reached for the zero.

01:53.720 --> 01:55.760
Well, mission accomplished.

01:55.760 --> 02:02.600
So this, this episode is announcing the release of The White Pill, a book you wrote, which

02:02.600 --> 02:07.600
is, I've gotten the honor, the privilege, the pleasure of being one of the first people

02:07.600 --> 02:08.600
to read it.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
You're the first.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.960
So I'm really, I don't know if nervous is the word, but you are the first person who

02:13.960 --> 02:16.840
has read it that I am speaking to about it.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.480
My first, my last, my everything.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
Yes.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.840
You say that to all the girls, but I'll take it.

02:21.840 --> 02:22.840
All the fembots.

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
All the fembots.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.800
But yeah, it was a truly incredible book.

02:25.800 --> 02:30.360
It's basically a story of evil in the 20th century.

02:30.360 --> 02:35.160
And throughout it, you reveal a thread that gives us hope.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.960
And that's the idea of The White Pill.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.560
So there's the, the blue pill and the red pill.

02:39.560 --> 02:45.240
There's the black pill, which is a kind of deeply cynical, maybe apathetic, just giving

02:45.280 --> 02:50.400
up on the world, given that you see behind the curtain and given that you don't like

02:50.400 --> 02:53.360
what you see, given that there's so much suffering in the world, you give up.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.360
That's the black pill.

02:54.360 --> 02:58.920
And the white pill, I suppose is even though you acknowledge that there's evil in the world,

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
you don't give up.

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
Yes.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.960
So if you're listening to this and you're a fan of this podcast, go to white pill book

03:04.960 --> 03:05.960
dot com.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.960
It'll go to it.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.960
White pill book dot com.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.020
And if you don't know how to spell, we'll probably have a link that you can click on.

03:12.060 --> 03:18.980
So for people who also don't know, Michael Malice is not just a troll, not just a hilarious,

03:18.980 --> 03:24.100
comedic genius who hosts his own podcast, but he is an incredible, brilliant author.

03:24.100 --> 03:28.340
Dear reader, the unauthorized autobiography, Kim Jong-il.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.180
So that's a story of North Korea.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.820
The New Right, A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.

03:33.820 --> 03:41.740
That's the story of the extremes of the United States political movements.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.180
And then the anarchist handbook that's talking about the ideologies, the different flavors

03:46.180 --> 03:48.300
of ideologies of anarchism.

03:48.300 --> 03:55.660
But on top of that, you're now going in, going into the darkest aspects of the 20th century

03:55.660 --> 03:59.020
with the Soviet Union and the communism with the white pill.

03:59.020 --> 04:03.660
So let me ask you, let's start at the beginning.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.780
At the end of the 19th century, as you write, the terms socialist, communist, and anarchist

04:07.780 --> 04:12.880
were used somewhat loosely and interchangeably because the prophesied Marxist society was

04:12.880 --> 04:16.180
one in which the state had famously withered away.

04:16.180 --> 04:20.580
There was a great disagreement about what a socialist system would look like in practice,

04:20.580 --> 04:21.980
but two things were clear.

04:21.980 --> 04:27.140
First, that socialism was both inevitable and scientific, the way of the future.

04:27.140 --> 04:32.100
And second, that the capitalist ruling class were not going down without a fight.

04:32.100 --> 04:37.580
So what are the key points of disagreement between the socialists, the anarchists, the

04:37.580 --> 04:40.540
communists at that time?

04:40.540 --> 04:44.940
At the end of the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century, the possibility of the

04:44.940 --> 04:49.420
century laid before us that eventually led to the First and the Second World War.

04:49.420 --> 04:53.960
The idea when the Industrial Revolution came and Marx was very much a product of Industrial

04:53.960 --> 04:58.840
Revolutionary thinking was, okay, now that we have technology, now that we have science,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.400
we can scientifically manage society.

05:01.400 --> 05:06.000
We saw this very much with Woodrow Wilson and this kind of idea of progressivism that

05:06.000 --> 05:13.800
we could use technology and kind of capitalism in their view, unfettered capitalism was wasteful.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
You're making too much stuff.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.800
You have surpluses.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.560
You have shortages.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.680
If we produce just exactly what we need and you have these people, engineers, the engineering

05:21.680 --> 05:26.840
society, then everyone will be happy and you won't have to have any suffering or waste.

05:26.840 --> 05:31.740
So socialism at that time was used as a broad umbrella.

05:31.740 --> 05:36.560
It's not used in the term that it means today of necessarily state socialism.

05:36.560 --> 05:40.240
It just meant the idea of having society scientifically run.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.000
So you had a huge argument.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
There are different wings.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.080
You even had it from the beginning with Marx versus Bakunin because Marx was for obviously

05:48.400 --> 05:51.880
state socialism, the absolute state running everything.

05:51.880 --> 05:57.080
Although even with Marx and Engels, it was a means to an end.

05:57.080 --> 06:01.480
After man is remade in his very nature, then the state withers away and everyone's equal

06:01.480 --> 06:04.320
and then you have this kind of heaven on earth situation.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.180
Bakunin was the opposite.

06:06.180 --> 06:11.600
He regarded the state as inherently immoral and wanted to have kind of like workers collectives

06:11.600 --> 06:14.320
and things like that and ultra-localized control.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.900
So the end was always stateless.

06:15.900 --> 06:20.980
It's just that some people viewed the state as a convenient, effective intermediate state.

06:20.980 --> 06:24.860
Well, I think at least Marx and Bakunin, there were plenty of others who just regarded

06:24.860 --> 06:30.540
it have the workers control the production via the state.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.140
By the way, how does my hat look?

06:32.140 --> 06:33.140
It looks great, festive.

06:33.140 --> 06:34.140
It's good?

06:34.140 --> 06:35.980
Is this side better than the other side?

06:35.980 --> 06:38.500
I think you want it on this side so people can see you.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.500
Oh, no, no, no.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.500
I want to...

06:40.500 --> 06:43.380
You know like when you have like hair over your hat?

06:43.380 --> 06:44.380
Peekaboo hair, it's called.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.740
Veronica Lake, I think was her name.

06:45.740 --> 06:49.100
And then I just glance flirtatiously towards the camera sometimes.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.100
I've got to...

06:50.100 --> 06:51.100
Stay.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.100
Don't go anywhere.

06:52.100 --> 06:53.100
Sure.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.100
Did I put on gloves?

06:56.100 --> 06:57.100
No.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.140
No glove, no glove.

07:01.140 --> 07:06.340
The bad aspect of white gloves is the blood stains them.

07:06.340 --> 07:11.120
So you have to get new ones every time.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.980
And now I glance flirtatiously after that.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.980
I'm sorry.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.940
Okay, Bakunin and Marx, go ahead.

07:16.940 --> 07:22.900
So there were other socialists who did not regard this kind of end times where the state

07:22.900 --> 07:24.540
was the other way at all.

07:24.540 --> 07:30.140
And there were various strains in between where you'd have some capitalism and some

07:30.140 --> 07:31.980
socialism.

07:31.980 --> 07:35.420
The concept of a safety net came out of socialist thinking.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.860
The Labour Party came out of the Fabian Socialists in Great Britain.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.780
Their logo was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

07:42.820 --> 07:45.820
And then when that was too on the nose, they changed it to a tortoise, meaning we're going

07:45.820 --> 07:51.620
to get to socialism slowly in the sense of either gradualism or boiling a frog.

07:51.620 --> 07:57.380
And also the big part of this thinking at the time, this is again the late 19th century,

07:57.380 --> 08:00.780
is the idea that there's going to be a worldwide workers' revolution.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.300
It wasn't going to be that in one country it was going to happen and then all the other

08:05.300 --> 08:06.300
countries would be capitalist.

08:06.300 --> 08:12.340
The idea was, all right, the workers in Germany have more in common with the workers in America

08:12.820 --> 08:15.460
than the workers in Germany have with the capitalists in Germany.

08:15.460 --> 08:19.180
So the idea is, all right, the working class all over the world at one point, they're going

08:19.180 --> 08:21.860
to be like, we're being exploited.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.140
It's getting worse and worse for us.

08:23.140 --> 08:24.820
We can't feed our families.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.460
We're getting injured and so on and so forth.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.580
And there's no compensation for this.

08:28.580 --> 08:31.700
We're just going to overthrow our chains and we're going to run everything ourselves.

08:31.700 --> 08:34.460
We're the ones running it already anyway.

08:34.460 --> 08:38.400
And you know, this was doing all the work and we're doing all the work.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.780
So why shouldn't we be getting all the benefit?

08:41.780 --> 08:45.160
What's the role of violence in all of this?

08:45.160 --> 08:48.540
So this was a big source of contention.

08:48.540 --> 08:53.720
So the Fabians, for example, in Britain, who are all socialists, they were very heavily

08:53.720 --> 08:57.260
of the idea that we can do this through the ballot box.

08:57.260 --> 09:03.420
We can advocate and agitate and get the people to be voting for their own self-interest and

09:03.420 --> 09:07.440
furthering the state at the expense of the capitalist class.

09:07.440 --> 09:13.740
And then there were the people who are the hardcore anarchists who were like, if voting

09:13.740 --> 09:16.000
changed anything, they wouldn't let us do it.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.600
And the only way to have a revolution is to have a revolution, to kill, to overthrow,

09:23.600 --> 09:26.500
to seize these factories.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.800
And this was a big argument.

09:28.800 --> 09:34.000
And it also fed into the idea of where does free speech end?

09:34.000 --> 09:38.840
Is it legal to be giving speeches advocating for violence and revolution?

09:38.840 --> 09:39.840
Is it legal?

09:39.840 --> 09:43.520
Johann Most, you know, who I discuss in the book and in the anarchist handbook, he published

09:43.520 --> 09:48.860
a book in the 1800s about how to build dynamite and how to build bombs.

09:48.860 --> 09:53.640
And this is a big free speech concern at the time because now anyone in their own house

09:53.640 --> 09:57.040
can make a bomb and kill lots of people.

09:57.040 --> 10:01.100
And this is something that was happening with enormous frequency at the time.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.220
People tend to think, you know, because we have these kind of prejudices or we only remember

10:05.220 --> 10:10.540
what's happening now, but this was a, I mean, World War II, excuse me, World War I got started

10:10.540 --> 10:13.660
with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

10:13.660 --> 10:17.940
There were lots of people, McKinley is another one who I discussed in the book, his assassination.

10:17.940 --> 10:22.860
There was lots of violence happening very regularly.

10:22.860 --> 10:27.140
And with the creation of dynamite, it kind of exponentially became more dangerous and

10:27.140 --> 10:28.140
threatening.

10:28.620 --> 10:32.460
On Wall Street, there was a bomb that went off, I think, in the 1920s and the shards

10:32.460 --> 10:35.700
of shrapnel are still in the JP Morgan building, I believe.

10:35.700 --> 10:40.740
Do you ever think if you were alive during that time, what you would be doing?

10:40.740 --> 10:43.460
You think of yourself as an anarchist.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.980
Would you be, where would you be?

10:44.980 --> 10:46.940
Would you be a socialist, a communist?

10:46.940 --> 10:50.180
Which parties would you attend figuratively and literally?

10:50.180 --> 10:54.540
Well, the thing that was so interesting back then is there was a woman named Mabel Dodge

10:54.540 --> 10:57.900
Lujan and she ended her days in Taos, New Mexico.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.700
She founded an artist colony.

10:59.700 --> 11:06.300
And she had an apartment on 9th Street and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, a shadow salon.

11:06.300 --> 11:09.500
And everyone got together and talked and you'd have Emma Goldman, who was an anarchist, Margaret

11:09.500 --> 11:13.060
Sanger, who invented Planned Parenthood and advocated for birth control.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.380
And you'd have the people from the Wobblies, the hardcore labor unions.

11:16.380 --> 11:20.700
And everyone kind of, Ed Shell Menken didn't attend, but he was friends with them all.

11:20.700 --> 11:26.940
So there was this very weird, with the birth of modernism in art and in kind of modernist

11:27.260 --> 11:31.420
thinking, there was this idea, like, all right, like this was the first time where you could

11:31.420 --> 11:36.340
be intellectual as a class, where there really was this space for people who were thinkers.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.700
And they just sat around being like, all right, like, what are we going to do with ourselves?

11:39.700 --> 11:45.740
You know, and you had it in modern art, you had it in literature, you had it in politics.

11:45.740 --> 11:50.640
So it was a very exciting time where people were like, all right, like everything is now

11:50.640 --> 11:51.640
on the table.

11:51.640 --> 11:53.260
What are we going to do with this?

11:53.260 --> 11:58.580
And they very much were aware that this was a break with, you know, the pre-industrial

11:58.580 --> 12:02.060
revolution kind of farmer labor era.

12:02.060 --> 12:05.500
Do you see, do you think for you, violence would be compelling?

12:05.500 --> 12:06.500
No.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.300
First of all, I'm too small.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.020
But second, I just-

12:10.020 --> 12:13.100
Dynamite doesn't care about your size.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.100
Yeah, but I mean, retribution does.

12:15.100 --> 12:21.020
And I think, I don't know, but to me, violence is the kind of thing where you think you're

12:21.020 --> 12:23.180
running it, but it's running you.

12:23.180 --> 12:28.500
Once you cross that line, violence sings its own song.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.340
So whenever I hear even contemporary times where people are advocating for violent actions,

12:33.340 --> 12:39.420
it's like when you start a fire, you're not like, I'm just going to burn down this house.

12:39.420 --> 12:44.760
And there's many cases over and over of people who are building bombs or trying to assassinate

12:44.760 --> 12:46.740
someone or things like that.

12:46.740 --> 12:52.460
And it ended up literally, literally, literally blowing up in their own face.

12:52.780 --> 12:58.540
And violence doesn't really work necessarily because, you know, if you have an assassination,

12:58.540 --> 13:00.780
you're not assassinating the presidency.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.620
You know, if you take out, you know, a president, there's another president instantly there.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.620
So what have you accomplished?

13:05.620 --> 13:08.960
Someone's husband, dad is gone.

13:08.960 --> 13:13.780
You replace them with someone who now is in a position to crack down and retaliate with

13:13.780 --> 13:14.780
even more violence.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.380
So it's, the calculus for me isn't there.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.220
Would I be advocating it for them?

13:20.220 --> 13:22.700
Who knows?

13:22.700 --> 13:26.740
But I mean, I don't know if I'd be able to have the space to be, I certainly wouldn't

13:26.740 --> 13:30.460
have the space to be a podcaster or like a media personality.

13:30.460 --> 13:32.220
That wasn't really a thing.

13:32.220 --> 13:36.700
To some extent, it was in the 1920s with the Algonquin Roundtable and all the people from

13:36.700 --> 13:40.140
the New Yorker magazine, but they were all drunks.

13:40.140 --> 13:47.420
You know, it was very much a weird kind of situation to be a thinker.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.620
What would you think you'd do?

13:48.620 --> 13:49.620
Work at a carnival?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.620
You look good in lipstick.

13:50.620 --> 13:51.620
Well, thank you.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.620
I look good in anything.

13:52.620 --> 13:55.620
What would I, I don't know.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.980
I mean, you're not building robots.

13:56.980 --> 13:57.980
I mean, you could have been a Tesla, right?

13:57.980 --> 13:58.980
Okay.

13:58.980 --> 13:59.980
I didn't mean a car.

13:59.980 --> 14:00.980
I meant the person.

14:00.980 --> 14:01.980
I understand.

14:01.980 --> 14:03.780
Oh, thank you for explaining the witty comments to me.

14:03.780 --> 14:08.100
It wasn't witty at all because you wouldn't get an Einstein because he was an immigrant.

14:08.100 --> 14:09.100
So I wouldn't work with an immigrant?

14:09.100 --> 14:10.100
What does that even mean?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.260
No, you would have been a Tesla-like figure.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.260
There's already a Tesla, so you wouldn't literally be Tesla.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.260
That's why I said a Tesla.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.260
Oh, a Tesla.

14:16.260 --> 14:17.260
Okay.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.100
All right.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.100
Thank you for the explanation.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.180
See, Michael doesn't only make funny things.

14:22.180 --> 14:23.460
He also explains them for you.

14:23.460 --> 14:24.460
It wasn't fun.

14:24.460 --> 14:25.460
Mansplains them.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.540
It wasn't funny at all.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.900
That I agree with.

14:27.900 --> 14:28.900
Okay.

14:28.900 --> 14:29.900
Okay.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.380
So yes, when you achieve.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.660
See, this is why Kanye didn't like you.

14:33.660 --> 14:34.660
It's this.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.580
All right.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.260
I'm downgrading you from a nine down to an eight.

14:40.260 --> 14:45.260
If you keep talking like this, a five is a real possibility.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.260
All right.

14:47.260 --> 14:57.140
The kind of vacuum that's created with violence is usually filled with a harsher figure.

14:57.140 --> 15:02.620
So you don't think violent revolution ultimately leads to positive progress in the short term?

15:02.620 --> 15:03.620
Well, sometimes it does.

15:03.620 --> 15:08.020
The American Revolution, I think, was a positive example, and overthrowing the Tsar, which

15:08.020 --> 15:11.180
was done peacefully, was a positive example.

15:11.180 --> 15:17.020
But again, when violence happens, people get scared, and they want the violence stopped

15:17.020 --> 15:22.220
immediately, and that's a call for authoritarianism, and you see it time and time again, and they

15:22.220 --> 15:23.220
also want retribution.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.820
They were like, bring this back to normal, and they don't really worry about things like

15:26.820 --> 15:31.020
civil liberties or things like that.

15:31.020 --> 15:36.940
And then it also creates this space for invasion from foreign sources or demagogues, like,

15:36.940 --> 15:38.740
oh, look, they're killing us in the streets.

15:38.740 --> 15:40.580
Now you got to support me.

15:40.580 --> 15:44.180
It's a very deadly game, obviously.

15:44.180 --> 15:50.620
I remember somebody told me that, I forget where it was, but they told me that from the

15:50.620 --> 15:56.040
very beginning it was obvious that communism is an evil system, or a system that leads

15:56.040 --> 15:57.940
to evil.

15:57.940 --> 16:01.900
And to me, at least, that's not, if I had to put myself in the beginning of the 20th

16:01.900 --> 16:05.660
century or at the end of the 19th century, that's totally not obvious.

16:05.660 --> 16:12.340
They are trying to elevate humanity, the basic worth of a human being, of a hard-working

16:12.340 --> 16:15.500
human being, of the working class, of the people that are doing the work and are striving

16:15.500 --> 16:20.020
and just really trying to build up society with their own hands.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.420
It seems like a beautiful ideal.

16:22.420 --> 16:29.700
So I guess the question is, can you see yourself believing in the ideas of socialism and communism?

16:29.700 --> 16:32.100
Yeah, let's say if you were living in Russia.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.280
Oh, yeah, easily.

16:33.280 --> 16:36.920
So first of all, I don't think anything is obvious in politics.

16:36.920 --> 16:41.140
It's not obvious that humans have rights.

16:41.140 --> 16:46.240
It's not obvious that liberty is better or the market's either, whether you're for a

16:46.240 --> 16:49.600
welfare state or you're for more free markets, not that those are obvious.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.520
Both of them involve an enormous amount of thought and background information.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.440
So when someone says something is obvious in politics, they really mean something is

16:57.440 --> 16:58.440
apparent.

16:58.440 --> 17:03.560
It's not apparent on its face that if we all get together and promote a society based

17:03.560 --> 17:09.520
on equality and we all chip in, that it's going to really be good for everyone.

17:09.520 --> 17:14.800
That to me is the promise of communism.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.680
It was also very appealing to many people because it was new.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.640
So the idea was, all right, we've tried it these other ways.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.300
There's all these negative consequences.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.880
You have all these slums.

17:26.880 --> 17:31.100
You have people getting fired and then they have no recourse.

17:31.100 --> 17:35.200
You have women with 10 kids and they can't feed their kids, infant mortality.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.880
You don't have sanitation.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.720
You don't have food.

17:38.720 --> 17:41.000
Everyone's illiterate and uneducated.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.680
Then here's saying, look, if we all chip in together, everyone will have clothes, everyone

17:44.680 --> 17:47.840
will have food, everyone will be educated, everyone will do their part.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.260
It's going to be rough in the short period.

17:50.260 --> 17:54.400
That's a very compelling case to be made for communism.

17:54.400 --> 18:01.680
It's really easy in many ways when something hasn't been tried to make it sound compelling

18:01.680 --> 18:08.640
because you just talk about how great it's going to be and then people are always arguing

18:08.640 --> 18:13.320
about how Venezuela and Sweden, you want democratic socialism to be like Sweden.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.840
You don't want it to be like Venezuela.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.480
The Venezuelans didn't vote for Venezuela.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.480
They voted for Sweden.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.920
They ended up with Venezuela.

18:21.920 --> 18:29.440
The thing with communism, especially at that era, it was very much correlated with people

18:29.440 --> 18:34.040
who are too smart for their own good because they had the idea that if we are just put

18:34.040 --> 18:41.320
in charge, instead of these business people or these heirs to great estates, if the people

18:41.320 --> 18:45.480
who are smart and get it like us, I don't mean you and me, the people at the time who

18:45.480 --> 18:50.600
are advocating for it, once we're in charge, since we're good people and we want what's

18:50.640 --> 18:55.600
best for everyone, we're going to make sure everyone's taken care of and they always talked

18:55.600 --> 18:59.360
about how much they cared about the little guy and so I'm sure some of them meant it

18:59.360 --> 19:03.080
a lot and they're like, look, if the guy in charge is very much concerned with the little

19:03.080 --> 19:07.920
guy, he's not going to slip between the cracks and it's just going to be absolutely great

19:07.920 --> 19:14.280
and we don't have to worry about the capitalist class just basically exploiting people and

19:14.280 --> 19:18.480
having these huge estates while these people can't even feed their own families.

19:18.480 --> 19:23.200
Since we have a little bit of momentum, can you steal me on the case for socialism at

19:23.200 --> 19:33.200
that time and even today? I don't know if there's a rhyme and a similarity to those

19:33.200 --> 19:37.960
to socialism as implemented at that time and what could possibly be implemented today,

19:37.960 --> 19:39.840
but maybe you can dance between the two.

19:39.840 --> 19:46.840
The steelman argument for socialism is if you have everything up to private industry,

19:46.840 --> 19:52.320
you do not have a guarantee that someone won't fall between the cracks and the other

19:52.320 --> 19:58.360
concern is in any other context, if someone is, let's suppose, mentally ill through no

19:58.360 --> 20:04.440
fault of their own or someone's handicapped, they can't feed themselves or mentally disabled

20:04.440 --> 20:10.680
or something like that, if you have everything up to charity, you see this with endangered

20:10.680 --> 20:15.800
species. The species that are cute, it's easy to raise money for them and protect them.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.360
Weird kind of frog somewhere that no one cares about, you can't raise money for it.

20:20.360 --> 20:27.720
There's people's interests are to what they find interesting. If someone who's not socially

20:27.720 --> 20:31.640
appealing in some way, whatever capacity, they're going to fall between the cracks

20:31.640 --> 20:37.080
and they're screwed. Under socialism, if you have a government taking care of everything,

20:37.080 --> 20:43.880
no one is left behind. You are guaranteed that the lowest of the low and the worst of the worst

20:43.880 --> 20:49.400
are still going to make sure that they're not starving the street or just left behind. That

20:49.400 --> 20:56.200
is a big moral case to be made for having the state running everything. In terms of economics,

20:56.200 --> 21:04.520
it's a lot harder, but the argument there would be it's not fair, a term which in my view does

21:04.520 --> 21:10.200
not actually have a good meaning, but it's not fair that because you were born a Rockefeller

21:10.200 --> 21:15.560
and I was born in Poland that you never have to worry about food for the rest of your life,

21:15.560 --> 21:22.040
whereas I have to worry about paying for a doctor for my kid. You won this lottery when

21:22.040 --> 21:25.480
you're born and now I have to be screwed and have to respect all your property. Why?

21:27.560 --> 21:34.440
That is another strong argument to be made for socialism. The other argument is if you have a

21:35.400 --> 21:42.280
media apparatus that is operated under profit-seeking principles, it is going to

21:42.280 --> 21:49.320
feed into people's worst qualities, most basic animal-like qualities and sensationalist qualities

21:49.320 --> 21:53.800
and will be used as a mechanism for capitalist control, whereas if the government, which

21:53.800 --> 22:00.760
represents all of us, is running things, then everyone will have a right to have their voice

22:00.760 --> 22:06.040
heard and won't be manipulated. That's the argument. What about the reaching towards the

22:06.040 --> 22:14.360
stateless version? Because you espouse the ideas of anarchism, it has the same conclusion,

22:15.080 --> 22:21.160
which is reaching towards the removal of the state to where we have some distributed

22:21.160 --> 22:27.000
reallocation of resources that are quote unquote fair. The thing is the Marxist vision of the

22:27.000 --> 22:33.800
state withering away and becoming anarchism, it's really kind of like the underpants gnomes,

22:33.800 --> 22:35.080
because it's like- Tell me more.

22:36.120 --> 22:40.440
Step one, you have Marxism- Tell me slowly. I'm sorry.

22:41.160 --> 22:45.800
You have full communism, the state's running everything, including education.

22:45.800 --> 22:51.480
Step two, question mark. Step three, anarchism. Their idea was that after enough time,

22:52.440 --> 22:58.760
the nature of man himself was going to change. And then the government would be superfluous

22:58.760 --> 23:05.160
because we would all be equal and we would all naturally or socially, whatever term they would

23:05.160 --> 23:12.920
use, want to act the part that we would need to do. And in fact, Reagan had a great joke about this

23:12.920 --> 23:19.160
where there were two commissars, I think, in Moscow. And when they're walking around, they're going,

23:19.320 --> 23:24.040
is this it? Have we done it? Have we reached full communism? The other goes, oh no,

23:24.040 --> 23:28.680
it's going to get a hell of a lot worse. So that's kind of the counterargument to that.

23:29.720 --> 23:33.640
Do you think culture, society can change the nature of man?

23:34.200 --> 23:34.440
No.

23:37.320 --> 23:41.880
You don't think this idea that, for example, America has been founded on that all men are

23:41.880 --> 23:50.360
created to equal, that that idea can't permeate the culture and thereby change how we see each

23:50.360 --> 23:55.560
other, how we think of the basic worth of a human being, and thereby change our nature?

23:55.560 --> 24:01.880
That's epigenetic. I don't think that changes the nature of man. I think, for example,

24:01.880 --> 24:05.960
if I say someone, which I agree with, that someone is innocent until proven guilty,

24:05.960 --> 24:09.800
they're not literally innocent. They're regarded in a legal context as innocent,

24:09.800 --> 24:16.680
but that person is or is not a murderer or thief or so on and so forth. So we can legally and

24:16.680 --> 24:21.800
ethically regard everyone as equal. But as Thomas Sowell pointed out, a human being isn't even

24:21.800 --> 24:26.760
equal to himself over the course of a day. Twins who are genetic clones are not equal to one another.

24:26.760 --> 24:33.960
So it is an important thing legally, and it's a good yardstick, but it's not literally true.

24:33.960 --> 24:43.960
But don't you think that law becomes ethics? So that idea of justice starts to internalize it,

24:43.960 --> 24:47.480
that we just, the way we behave, the way we think about the world?

24:47.480 --> 24:52.840
No, I think it's a complete red herring because no one is—

24:52.840 --> 24:54.520
No, you're a red herring.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.840
Okay. See what I did there?

24:56.840 --> 25:05.080
It's a herring. Because people are still going to always prefer their family to strangers,

25:05.080 --> 25:09.800
or their in-group to out-group. So in terms of if you're going to have equality, that means it's

25:09.800 --> 25:16.040
going to not matter to you whether someone is your mom or someone down the street, and I don't see

25:16.040 --> 25:21.720
how that will ever become the case. Do you think it would be possible if you were an intellectual

25:22.120 --> 25:25.400
like you are at the beginning of the 20th century? Would you be able to predict

25:25.400 --> 25:27.320
the rest of the 20th century?

25:27.320 --> 25:35.640
No, I don't think at all. I think there were so many out of nowhere turns that no one would have

25:35.640 --> 25:43.640
seen them coming. And as an example, Lenin seizing power and making the Bolshevik revolution a

25:43.640 --> 25:50.760
reality was regarded as utopian and insane. The fact that he pulled it off is, you know,

25:51.560 --> 25:57.800
close to miraculous, and it was quite literally unprecedented. So that's a very big one.

25:58.360 --> 26:03.240
Which aspect of it—sorry to interrupt—which aspect was hard to predict? That a singular figure

26:03.240 --> 26:05.880
with just some ideas would be able to take so much power?

26:07.160 --> 26:12.600
And maintain that power and remake that society so drastically, so quickly despite such opposition?

26:12.600 --> 26:16.600
Also, not just a set of temporary protests by hooligans that lead to

26:17.160 --> 26:22.920
turmoil in the short term, but then stabilizes, but literally changes the entirety of the society.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.480
Yeah, Ludendorff, who was the German general, he's like, all right, we got to get the Russians out

26:27.480 --> 26:32.200
of World War I. He's the one who's like, all right, let's get this lunatic Lenin who already

26:32.200 --> 26:37.160
tried and failed to have a revolution in Russia. Let's send him back there. And he's just going to

26:37.160 --> 26:40.440
cause problems for everybody. And it's going to be great because it's going to weaken Russia. And

26:40.440 --> 26:46.200
then our Eastern front isn't going to have to be a problem. And then to his surprise, and everyone

26:46.280 --> 26:53.560
else's, including anarchists and communists worldwide, they pulled off this October revolution.

26:53.560 --> 26:58.840
And then for a while, it's like, all right, I think my understanding is even people at the time

26:58.840 --> 27:04.760
in St. Petersburg and in Moscow were like, what does this even mean? No one took it seriously.

27:04.760 --> 27:09.720
And then very quickly, you had the Cheka and the secret police and all these other kind of

27:09.720 --> 27:15.640
implementations of the communist state. And people are like, oh, they're not messing around.

27:15.640 --> 27:21.480
But they're like, all right, this is not going to last for long. And the USA, the US and A,

27:21.480 --> 27:25.320
we didn't even recognize the Soviet Union's legitimacy for a very long time. There were

27:25.320 --> 27:30.440
no diplomatic relations. And after a certain point, it's like, if you don't recognize Lenin

27:30.440 --> 27:35.480
and Stalin's government, who's the government of Russia or the Soviet Union? Is it the Tsar?

27:35.480 --> 27:40.600
You have to recognize it. They're not going anywhere. So that was something that was not,

27:40.600 --> 27:46.600
I think, very predictable. The Great Depression, in retrospect, there were certain things that

27:46.600 --> 27:51.160
were predictable, but it was not at all the case that it needed to last as long as it did in the

27:51.160 --> 27:59.640
states as FDR made it do. So there's all sorts of things. I mean, if they fought Germany's

27:59.640 --> 28:04.360
remilitarization, World War II could have been prevented. If you didn't have the Treaty of Versailles,

28:04.360 --> 28:07.800
would you have the hyperinflation? Would you have Hitler? These are all, I think,

28:08.440 --> 28:11.080
choose-your-own-adventure moments where things could have gone in other directions.

28:12.120 --> 28:17.640
I don't believe this kind of idea. This is a very Marxist idea that history is inevitable,

28:17.640 --> 28:22.120
and once you start with certain premises, the contradictions kind of unfold. I think that's

28:22.120 --> 28:28.200
ridiculous. I feel that there's power in the Santa Claus outfit. Yeah. I mean, it's a fundamentally

28:28.200 --> 28:35.720
communist idea, right? How? Santa Claus. Arbitrary redistribution of wealth. It's not redistribution.

28:35.720 --> 28:44.680
Well, at least I decide who's good and bad. Only I know this. I mean, I am somehow getting

28:44.680 --> 28:52.680
funding from someone, right? No. Okay. Listen, I have so much to teach you, little Michael.

28:52.680 --> 28:57.640
Workshop? Yeah. How many people do you think are employed in this workshop?

28:57.640 --> 28:58.920
They're slaves. Yes.

28:59.560 --> 29:03.160
I don't know. How many elves are in the workshop? I think the rest of you are going to have to look

29:03.160 --> 29:06.840
into it. No, anyway, and the red colors and everything. Is that the biggest holiday of

29:06.840 --> 29:12.360
all time, Christmas, just in terms of the intensity of the festivities?

29:12.360 --> 29:17.640
No. I think Christmas is a very recent phenomenon. I think historically, it was not a big deal.

29:17.640 --> 29:23.640
No, I know. Historically, it's not been, but in terms of how much it captivates, how intense it

29:23.640 --> 29:28.520
is, I guess, from a capitalist perspective, how much is going on, how visual it is, how intense it

29:28.600 --> 29:33.080
is, how it grabs a whole population. I think it's because the idea of Christmas

29:33.080 --> 29:39.800
is probably one of the most powerful holiday ideas. Easter's probably up there. Easter's

29:39.800 --> 29:44.600
obviously up there because you have Christ's resurrection, so that's kind of a big one,

29:44.600 --> 29:51.080
but Christmas is this symbol of brotherhood and kindness and magnanimity. You know, one of the

29:51.080 --> 29:56.280
things I despise about our culture is this glory, and something I'm fighting very heavily with this

29:56.280 --> 30:00.920
book, or at least attempting to, is this glorification of cynicism. This kind of like,

30:00.920 --> 30:07.240
oh, you like this song, that's cute, it's stupid. Whereas Christmas is the one time of year where

30:07.240 --> 30:13.480
you could be happy and joyous and kind, and people don't get to roll their eyes at you.

30:14.040 --> 30:20.120
They get to stop being too cool for school, and they get to be like, you know, I enjoy your

30:20.120 --> 30:26.680
friendship, you're my sister, my brother, my dad, my mom, whatever, and it was Ayn Rand's

30:26.680 --> 30:32.520
favorite holiday. I adore it, especially Christmas in New York, and it's just this idea of like,

30:33.160 --> 30:41.320
even though we're cold and it's dark outside, you know, it's still cozy, and let's hope the next

30:41.320 --> 30:47.320
year is, because with Russians, Diyatmarovka Santa comes on New Year's, so it's kind of like,

30:47.320 --> 30:51.720
let's make this next year an even better one. So it's very much the holiday of hope and joy.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.560
And like, love for family, for friendship.

30:55.560 --> 30:57.560
And kindness and benevolence, yeah.

30:57.560 --> 31:03.160
And like almost the whole, that whole rat race of chasing material possessions and all that

31:03.160 --> 31:06.680
gets put on hold for a beef moment, and it just all goes quiet.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.120
But it's also about giving people material possessions, like here, like I value you,

31:10.120 --> 31:11.720
this is something that brings you joy, yeah.

31:11.720 --> 31:16.680
Yeah, you're right in the book, which by the way, people should go get by it right now.

31:16.680 --> 31:22.120
If you support this podcast, or if you support The Ridiculous Office that Michael's wears,

31:22.760 --> 31:25.320
the more books you buy, the more outfits he is going to wear.

31:25.320 --> 31:29.480
I've got two, my next two appearances in the show, assuming I don't burn this bridge.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.000
I've got some good ones.

31:31.000 --> 31:38.520
This bridge has been burning for a long time. We've been going across the road by canoe at

31:38.520 --> 31:40.840
this point. Next time, we're going to be swimming.

31:42.840 --> 31:46.440
How the hell are you going to swim? You're made out of lead.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.000
Yeah, it's true.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.120
Sink to the bottom, get dragged across by rope.

31:50.680 --> 31:55.000
Okay, you write in the book, cynics like to lie and call themselves realists.

31:55.000 --> 32:00.040
Hoping for positive outcomes can thus be dismissed as being naive or utopian.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.080
Can you elaborate on this point, just like you said right now?

32:03.080 --> 32:11.400
I mean, it seems like a, I don't know if it's a fundamental characteristic of our society today,

32:11.400 --> 32:15.320
or just societies throughout history, but there is a cynicism.

32:15.880 --> 32:20.040
You write in the Soviet Union, it was really, there's a deep cynicism.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.240
That was good at the end, yeah.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.080
But there is a cynicism today as well, at least in public discourse.

32:27.080 --> 32:27.320
Yes.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.760
Why does it happen and how can we fight it?

32:31.960 --> 32:37.480
I think it is easy to be like, everything sucks.

32:38.440 --> 32:44.280
You know, I had my friend Lux, she was a blogger and she was an author.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.880
She had this great line because, you know, we worked in media and she's like,

32:47.880 --> 32:51.720
if you're at a party and someone starts talking about a new app or website

32:51.720 --> 32:55.240
and you don't know anything about it, just say, oh, I was on that for a while, it sucked.

32:56.200 --> 32:59.560
And that's all you need to say. I'm like, Lux, that's a great line.

32:59.560 --> 33:05.320
But I think it is, and especially I'm sure you had to, you experienced this as well with your

33:05.320 --> 33:10.360
family, I certainly did with mine. There is this idea, especially in Russian culture,

33:10.360 --> 33:16.120
but in American culture to some extent as well, where if you have aspirations,

33:16.680 --> 33:19.160
I remember there was this show called Russian Dolls.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.520
It was, oh, I just got it, like the Matryoshka.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.960
Okay, I just got it, that's the name.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.720
Okay, the show was called Russian Dolls.

33:25.720 --> 33:28.600
It was about Brighton Beach, which is the Russian Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.680
It was supposed to be their version of Jersey Shore.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.480
It was on Lifetime and it had no ratings.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.800
And I remember the last four episodes, they had to burn them.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.440
So they just ran it through like 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. one day.

33:38.440 --> 33:43.160
And there was this one scene where one of the girls, I forget her name, probably Natalia,

33:43.160 --> 33:50.360
and she'd been in college and she had been wondering what she wanted to major in, right?

33:50.360 --> 33:53.160
And this story was so perfect, I'm sure I've told it before.

33:53.160 --> 33:57.800
And she took an aptitude test and she went with her mom to get like mani-pedis or something.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.880
And she goes, mom, you know, I've had like 80 majors.

33:59.880 --> 34:01.480
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.080
And she goes, I took this aptitude test.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.200
It really made sense to me.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.360
I am going to go to law school.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.240
I want to be a lawyer.

34:07.240 --> 34:08.200
This is something I enjoy.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.600
And the first thing out of her mom's mouth is how are you going to pay for it?

34:11.240 --> 34:15.160
And the girl, and I really relate it because if you didn't have this Russian upbringing,

34:15.160 --> 34:18.360
you watched it, you would think her reaction was completely insane.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.520
She just lost it, just screaming.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.000
She's like, people pay for law school all the time.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.120
I'll figure out a way.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.680
Why is your first reaction to look for a problem?

34:26.680 --> 34:30.760
Why is your first response to be like, oh, are you sure you've thought this through?

34:30.760 --> 34:35.800
I have been struggling with one problem for years, what I wanted to do for a living.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.560
And now like as soon as I solve this one big problem of identity,

34:39.560 --> 34:41.880
your first reaction is like, let's find a new problem.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.760
Why is that your approach?

34:42.760 --> 34:45.560
Instead of let's figure out how we're going to pay for it.

34:45.560 --> 34:53.000
And that kind of approach is so deadly and it gnaws at you.

34:53.000 --> 34:57.480
And I always, I don't like giving people advice because who the hell am I?

34:57.480 --> 34:59.320
And also if I don't know the context of the problem,

34:59.320 --> 35:01.080
I'm not informed enough to give advice.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.560
But this is a piece of advice that I do for comfort giving.

35:03.560 --> 35:09.640
If you are someone who has around you people who as soon as you have any accomplishment

35:09.640 --> 35:13.000
or any hope that their first reaction is to be like, well, what about this?

35:13.640 --> 35:16.840
You have to get rid of them or sit them down, maybe give them a chance.

35:16.840 --> 35:22.760
Because that is something that is so demoralizing and it drains you.

35:22.760 --> 35:28.520
And it's like, you know, the example I've used all the time, all the time, all the time.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.240
I say, if you want to be an author, right?

35:31.240 --> 35:37.160
You can go to any bookstore and look at all the shitty, shitty books like The White Pill.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.360
And you could say to yourself, I could be the shitty author.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.480
You don't have to be Hemingway.

35:41.480 --> 35:45.800
So people should buy your book just to know that it doesn't take much.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.320
It really does not take much.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.240
What shitty writing is all about?

35:50.360 --> 35:51.560
And boring.

35:51.560 --> 35:55.000
Yeah, you could just pick a random, random period in history

35:55.000 --> 35:59.640
and just write a bunch of crap about it and put a pretty stamp on the cover and just go.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.600
It was pretty, yeah.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.000
But I mean, like for you, right?

36:03.000 --> 36:05.400
Like not, you don't, I don't mean you-

36:05.400 --> 36:06.600
I was raised by the wolves.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.240
The wolf bots.

36:09.240 --> 36:13.880
There's lots of standard comedians who aren't Jerry Seinfeld, right?

36:13.880 --> 36:16.360
If you want to be a podcaster, you don't have to be Joe Rogan.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.880
You could be someone who's got a medium audience and are enjoying it.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.280
So like the idea that like something has to be,

36:23.080 --> 36:26.200
you have to be a massive superstar or you're a failure is also ridiculous.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.080
But that's cynicism.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.600
I mean, you can even be a failed comedian like Dave Smith.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.480
There's a generic name I came up with as an example.

36:36.440 --> 36:38.200
I think he has like a podcast of some kind.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.440
Yeah, not very funny.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.760
I don't know why you would call himself a comedian, but you-

36:42.760 --> 36:43.640
He's being ironic.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.920
Don't you think?

36:46.920 --> 36:50.600
Yeah, so even then you could do something special.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.840
I remember what you did with me in the movie theater.

36:52.840 --> 36:53.340
What's that?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.080
Can you explain the jokes?

36:57.080 --> 36:57.640
Because I can't.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.320
No, I'm not explaining jokes.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.520
I'm wearing lipstick.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.160
It's not enough.

37:01.880 --> 37:04.200
Now I remember what you did to me in a movie theater

37:05.080 --> 37:07.080
and you wore lipstick that night too.

37:07.080 --> 37:07.960
Not when I was done.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.120
People for sure will think this feels like a gay porn.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.680
Like a very long intro.

37:14.680 --> 37:15.880
Because we're not wearing pants?

37:16.520 --> 37:19.240
Yes, there's many reasons why this feels like this.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.040
And the outfits and just everything about this.

37:23.720 --> 37:24.440
How would you know?

37:25.160 --> 37:26.360
I'm my friend.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.160
I have stories.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.240
I thought I don't have friends.

37:31.720 --> 37:35.800
They're all suspiciously named either Lex or Lux or some variation.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.560
Like you lack complete creativity.

37:38.680 --> 37:39.960
Just like in the writing of your book.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.840
Or Lux.

37:40.840 --> 37:41.340
Yeah.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.880
It's like you didn't even use like a thesaurus for your book.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.560
The same words over and over and over.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.480
That's bad.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.480
The sad thing about the cynicism is like,

37:52.600 --> 37:54.520
I don't think it's just a Russian thing.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.920
Let me interrupt you because I didn't finish what you were saying earlier.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.920
In America, it's not just a Russian thing.

38:00.920 --> 38:06.920
In American culture, if you have like a sitcom or a musical,

38:06.920 --> 38:10.920
it's regarded as less legitimate than a drama, right?

38:10.920 --> 38:14.600
Like if something's got to be about someone struggling or someone suffering.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.760
Whereas this is like a joyous happy story.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.760
Maybe something like Pixar, right?

38:18.760 --> 38:20.600
Sure, they have conflict and they're going for something,

38:20.600 --> 38:25.560
but overall the background the universe is taking in is very joyous and happy.

38:25.560 --> 38:29.320
That is regarded artistically as less legitimate

38:29.320 --> 38:33.560
than something which is dark and the background is despair.

38:33.560 --> 38:38.680
And that very subtly sends a very, to me, pernicious message

38:38.680 --> 38:44.040
that what's real is despair and happiness is the aberration.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.280
And I think if you have that as your mindset,

38:46.280 --> 38:49.960
you're setting yourself up for maybe not failure, but certainly not happiness.

38:51.320 --> 38:55.800
Yeah, but that's in the figures, the ideas that the culture elevates,

38:55.800 --> 39:01.480
but the local personal life of parents and teachers, that still happens a lot.

39:01.480 --> 39:05.800
In Russia and here, just my whole life, especially because I'm a weirdo,

39:06.680 --> 39:11.960
I've been kind of told to basically be less weird.

39:12.920 --> 39:22.200
There's a kind of sense in where there's a certain path you're supposed to take in life

39:23.400 --> 39:28.200
and every time you have a little bit of success on those very specifically defined paths,

39:28.200 --> 39:30.440
you're pushed to do more and more and more on those paths,

39:30.440 --> 39:34.840
as opposed to celebrating the full complexity of the weirdo that each one of us is,

39:34.840 --> 39:36.040
and I certainly am.

39:36.040 --> 39:41.320
And just teachers, even friends, and certainly family,

39:42.120 --> 39:48.760
have constantly been very cynical about my aspirations, my dreams, and so on.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.840
I think that actually created a deeply self-critical engine in my brain

39:56.280 --> 40:05.480
that I think ultimately was productive because it was also balanced by just an internal,

40:05.480 --> 40:09.480
maybe through genetics, thing I have of optimism about the world,

40:09.480 --> 40:11.480
of just seeing the beauty in the world.

40:11.480 --> 40:18.440
But it is weird looking back how much people that love me were trying to bring me down.

40:18.440 --> 40:18.680
Yeah.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.560
So strange.

40:19.560 --> 40:22.600
It's also very hurtful for me because when I graduated college,

40:22.600 --> 40:27.000
it was important for me to be self-made and not take money from my family.

40:27.560 --> 40:32.120
And I remember my grandma, this was a huge argument, an ongoing argument,

40:32.120 --> 40:37.880
and one time as she was leaving my house, she slipped money in under the door and I threw it

40:37.880 --> 40:39.560
out and it made me so angry.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.240
Or like one year for my birthday, she gave me I think like $500,

40:43.240 --> 40:46.360
which was a lot of money when you're like 22 or 23.

40:46.360 --> 40:52.040
And I was so pissed because that told me that they didn't believe

40:52.040 --> 40:55.320
that I'd be able to feed myself or make it on my own.

40:55.960 --> 41:02.600
And I understand their mindset, but it's like I was never hungry.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.840
I remember I'd have to wait on the subway because I couldn't afford a cab.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.720
But that was a sacrifice I had to make.

41:09.720 --> 41:10.680
I had to wait that half hour.

41:10.680 --> 41:18.120
So it was a huge source and remains a source of enormous tension and contention.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.640
And I think also, I'm sure speaking to your upbringing,

41:22.200 --> 41:26.120
in their minds, unless you're going into an office, you can't pay the rent.

41:26.120 --> 41:27.080
It doesn't make sense.

41:28.840 --> 41:32.280
But there's just like you said, forget the office, forget all that.

41:32.280 --> 41:37.160
No matter what, there's always whatever you accomplish in life,

41:38.120 --> 41:42.360
you're always negative about your current position.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.560
You always come up with another problem, just like you said.

41:46.840 --> 41:50.040
It's like a self-generating problem box.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.320
Yeah, I remember I didn't speak to my dad for a few years.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.080
Then I'm like, let me give this guy another chance.

41:55.720 --> 41:59.560
And in that time period, Harvey P. Carr, the author of

41:59.560 --> 42:02.920
Subjects of American Splendor, the movie and author of the series of comic books,

42:02.920 --> 42:05.800
he and I became friends and he was writing a graphic novel about me.

42:06.760 --> 42:12.200
And when I met with my dad, I'm like, oh, someone's writing a book about me.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.800
And he goes, I know, so.

42:14.600 --> 42:19.000
And it was one of those moments where I'm like, wow, you're an asshole.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.440
And not the kind of asshole I am.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.440
You're just like not a good person.

42:22.440 --> 42:27.800
And I don't know or really at this point care what the motivation

42:27.800 --> 42:31.880
or if there was no motivation with the visceral emotional reasoning for that.

42:31.880 --> 42:37.000
But that kind of thing is something I, much later now in life,

42:37.000 --> 42:39.720
have absolutely no tolerance for.

42:39.720 --> 42:45.160
Well, in my own private life, I try to forgive and love those people.

42:45.160 --> 42:49.480
But there have been a few in my life like this.

42:49.480 --> 42:54.760
And I think they are incredible people if you allow yourself to see it, but they're flawed.

42:54.760 --> 42:58.360
And so I try to forgive them.

42:58.360 --> 43:02.760
That said, it is true that the people that are close to you, especially family,

43:02.760 --> 43:05.000
have a disproportionate psychological effect on you.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.920
So you have to be very careful having them in your life too much.

43:09.720 --> 43:15.080
One thing is to love them and the other is to actually allow yourself to flourish.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.080
Surround yourself with people that help you flourish.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.800
And like you said, the advice there is really powerful,

43:20.360 --> 43:24.200
especially early on to have people that believe in you,

43:24.840 --> 43:28.920
in whatever crazy big dreams you have, that pat you on the back and say,

43:28.920 --> 43:30.040
you got this kid.

43:30.040 --> 43:32.200
And here's the other thing.

43:33.400 --> 43:39.000
If you try and you don't make it to that Rogan level, it's okay.

43:39.960 --> 43:45.080
Like I have several books that I've written that are on my hard drive that have not been published.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.680
And there were a lot of work.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.440
And it was really disappointing when they went out and no publishers were interested.

43:50.440 --> 43:52.520
And maybe I'll publish them one day, maybe I won't.

43:52.520 --> 43:54.280
Point being, it's fine.

43:54.280 --> 43:55.320
I tried.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.680
Is it a romance novel?

43:56.680 --> 43:57.080
One is.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.040
Gay romance novel?

44:00.040 --> 44:03.960
Does it have a guy in a Santa outfit in it?

44:03.960 --> 44:07.720
Can you please stop asking me to send you gay pornography?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.920
He's calling me up all hours of the night.

44:10.920 --> 44:12.440
I need more gay porn.

44:12.440 --> 44:13.400
I need some ones.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.440
I only have zeros.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.960
Yeah, never enough.

44:17.960 --> 44:19.320
This one almost got a book deal.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.320
This would have been 16 years ago.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.840
It was a ladlet novel.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.000
What kind of novel?

44:25.000 --> 44:25.800
Ladlet.

44:25.800 --> 44:27.240
It's like Nick Hornby.

44:27.240 --> 44:27.480
What?

44:27.480 --> 44:29.160
Nick Hornby, about a boy.

44:29.160 --> 44:33.960
So there was a little mini-genre of these books about young men trying to struggle their way through.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.520
There's a whole little series of them.

44:36.520 --> 44:39.080
Fight Club is adjacent to that.

44:39.640 --> 44:40.840
It's not literally that ladlet.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.400
I feel like you would write a great Fight Club type novel.

44:46.200 --> 44:49.880
You know, Fight Club is much, and Chuck Paul, in my understanding, admitted this.

44:49.880 --> 44:53.240
Fight Club is one of the few things where the movie is better than the book.

44:54.600 --> 44:55.480
Oh, that's interesting.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.200
But the movie is so iconic.

44:58.760 --> 44:59.400
Yeah, for sure.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.320
But still, isn't there a deeply philosophical,

45:03.320 --> 45:08.040
it's kind of like David Foster Wallace novels, doesn't Fight Club capture some moment in time?

45:09.480 --> 45:11.560
I was hanging out with Kurt Metzger a couple weeks ago.

45:11.560 --> 45:12.520
Comedian, very failed comedian.

45:12.520 --> 45:13.240
Name drop.

45:13.240 --> 45:14.600
Yeah, Kurt.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.160
Watch out.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.560
And he had this great story.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
He was hanging out with Patrice O'Neill, the late comedian.

45:19.560 --> 45:20.360
Name drop.

45:20.360 --> 45:22.520
With the great comics of all time.

45:23.880 --> 45:29.480
And Patrice goes, Kurt was talking about how much he liked the book or the movie Fight Club,

45:29.480 --> 45:33.240
and Patrice is like, that is the whitest book on earth.

45:33.240 --> 45:35.960
He goes, your problem in life is you don't have enough violence.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.760
Your problem in life, you need someone to beat you up.

45:38.760 --> 45:39.800
That's not a problem for me.

45:40.680 --> 45:48.440
Yeah, but still, it is a very white book, but it still captures a kind of anger and angst

45:48.440 --> 45:51.560
and a certain subculture in society that's really powerful.

45:51.560 --> 45:57.320
That probably led to, in some part, to the thing you wrote about in The New Right.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.360
Oh, for sure.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.240
I mean, it was this kind of like, there's that line in the movie where

46:02.680 --> 46:05.080
Edward Norton says, I'm a 30-year-old boy.

46:05.080 --> 46:08.040
This kind of question of what is it, sorry to be Matt Walsh,

46:08.040 --> 46:09.800
but what does it mean to be a man, right?

46:09.800 --> 46:11.240
What does masculinity mean?

46:11.800 --> 46:16.280
Why are so many men at such a young age feeling so lost?

46:16.280 --> 46:18.840
This idea that like, if I fill my house with nice furniture,

46:18.840 --> 46:20.520
that's still not going to be fulfilling to anyone.

46:21.720 --> 46:23.000
Matt Walsh is-

46:23.000 --> 46:23.880
He's from The Daily Wire.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.120
He just did a documentary called What is a Woman?

46:26.120 --> 46:27.800
Can you explain? I don't know who he is.

46:27.800 --> 46:31.320
So Matt Walsh is someone who works for The Daily Wire.

46:31.320 --> 46:31.880
Yes.

46:31.880 --> 46:35.400
And he just recently did a documentary called What is a Woman?

46:35.400 --> 46:36.440
I think it was called.

46:36.440 --> 46:41.000
And he went out to lots of people working in gender theory and that thing,

46:41.000 --> 46:45.400
and he asked them to define, and he went to the Maasai in Africa, the tribe,

46:45.400 --> 46:48.600
and to talk to people about transgenderism, non-binary,

46:48.600 --> 46:50.120
which is a word I know you hate.

46:50.120 --> 46:53.400
And the documentary was surprisingly well done.

46:53.400 --> 46:56.200
Is that like a passive-aggressive compliment?

46:56.840 --> 46:58.120
Surprisingly well done.

46:58.120 --> 47:01.800
Well, because Matt is very aggressive on Twitter.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.640
We follow each other.

47:03.640 --> 47:10.200
And there was a lot of opportunities in this film for him to really be like,

47:11.320 --> 47:15.080
and instead, to his credit, he let the people speak.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.200
And it's possible it was edited a certain way, of course.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.560
It was obviously edited.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.160
But when he just asked them, can you just define a woman for me in playing dumb?

47:23.160 --> 47:23.880
We're not playing dumb.

47:23.880 --> 47:25.400
Just saying, what's your opinion?

47:25.400 --> 47:29.800
A lot of the people he was speaking to were getting extremely agitated.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.680
So it worked in that kind of context as well.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.280
It was not his usual style.

47:35.640 --> 47:38.760
Speaking of which, do you ever regret your behavior on Twitter?

47:40.120 --> 47:43.240
There were a couple of times, but very rarely.

47:44.200 --> 47:49.080
Can you describe the big strategy before we dive back into the October Revolution?

47:50.520 --> 47:51.400
My strategy...

47:51.400 --> 47:54.680
Do you have a strategy, or does it come from the heart?

47:55.240 --> 47:56.440
Or does it come from the brain?

47:57.160 --> 48:00.200
It comes from, I want to have fun.

48:01.160 --> 48:02.440
That's literally what it comes down to.

48:02.440 --> 48:03.000
It's like, this is...

48:03.000 --> 48:04.360
Girls just want to have fun.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.360
Are you drunk?

48:06.360 --> 48:08.200
What is in there?

48:10.600 --> 48:11.400
I'm very cheeky.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.600
I have the holiday spirit, even though it's not the holidays.

48:14.600 --> 48:15.320
That's eggnog in there.

48:15.320 --> 48:15.880
It's delirious.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.320
I did not sleep much last night.

48:18.920 --> 48:21.960
I think the second time we talked, or the third time, the second time,

48:22.840 --> 48:24.280
I stayed up almost all night.

48:24.280 --> 48:24.680
Oh, I know.

48:24.680 --> 48:25.960
I keep track of when you come and go.

48:26.680 --> 48:32.040
My door camera points at your garage, so I know when you're leaving or coming home.

48:32.040 --> 48:37.320
My camera points at your bedroom from the inside, but I shouldn't have told you that now.

48:38.600 --> 48:40.840
Let me ask you this, because this is something that's been bothering me.

48:40.840 --> 48:45.480
There was a chair that you threw out, and I was looking at my camera,

48:45.480 --> 48:47.400
and I'm like, let me see when he threw this out.

48:47.400 --> 48:49.800
And then one time you went to the garbage and you adjusted it

48:49.800 --> 48:51.480
to make it stick out of the garbage even more.

48:51.480 --> 48:52.360
What were you doing there?

48:56.680 --> 48:58.760
To make sure that people know there's a chair in there.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.080
Well, like the garbage person, so they know it's a chair, so they don't get...

49:04.120 --> 49:06.600
I always think I don't want them to get hurt or whatever.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.440
Oh, okay.

49:08.440 --> 49:10.680
Like they open the thing, it's like, ah, chair.

49:11.560 --> 49:12.680
I don't know what I was thinking.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.880
Okay, it was really odd.

49:13.880 --> 49:15.080
I didn't know how to get rid of a chair.

49:15.080 --> 49:15.640
It was broken.

49:15.640 --> 49:18.520
It was cracked, and it was a problem.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.720
Twitter for me, my point is to have fun.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.760
It's also fun to kind of smack down people who I regard as bad actors,

49:27.640 --> 49:31.560
and also kind of to promote news that I find interesting that maybe isn't as

49:31.560 --> 49:34.200
prominently part of the culture as it might otherwise be.

49:34.200 --> 49:39.320
Do you think sometimes you draw too broadly the category of people that are bad actors,

49:39.320 --> 49:46.200
and then thereby sort of adding to the mockery and the cynicism in the world?

49:46.200 --> 49:49.080
I don't think mockery and cynicism are at all synonymous.

49:49.640 --> 49:51.480
I think cynicism means everyone sucks.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.520
I don't think everyone sucks.

49:52.520 --> 49:57.240
I think it is undeniable that a lot of people suck.

49:57.240 --> 49:59.480
What if I told you most people don't suck?

50:00.360 --> 50:04.120
Could you steal me on the case that most people don't suck?

50:04.120 --> 50:04.600
Sure.

50:04.600 --> 50:06.280
I can do it in a cynical way, honestly.

50:06.280 --> 50:07.640
It's quite a cynical way.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.240
I think most people are neither here nor there.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.120
Most people just kind of go with the flow.

50:12.840 --> 50:13.960
They're amiable.

50:13.960 --> 50:15.880
Human beings are social creatures.

50:15.880 --> 50:16.840
They want to get along.

50:17.480 --> 50:18.920
They don't want to cause problems.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.800
They don't have the capacity to be the target of a problem.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.400
If most people sucked, then going anywhere would be an excruciating ordeal.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.880
Like literally, the airport's annoying, but if most people sucked,

50:33.880 --> 50:35.000
it would really be annoying.

50:35.000 --> 50:36.920
You know, going to the supermarket would be really annoying.

50:36.920 --> 50:42.440
So I don't think most people suck, but I do think that in public discourse,

50:43.160 --> 50:49.480
there are lots of people who are dishonest about their agenda.

50:49.480 --> 50:55.880
For example, I could be someone who has promoting a certain ideology,

50:55.880 --> 50:58.200
but I'm in the payroll of a candidate.

50:58.760 --> 51:02.280
My think tank needs this to happen, or I'm being paid for something like that.

51:02.280 --> 51:04.440
So that sort of thing, I think, happens all the time.

51:04.440 --> 51:06.440
There's the line I have in the book, Upton Sinclair.

51:07.080 --> 51:11.480
I forgot how he worded exactly, but it's very hard to convince someone of something

51:11.480 --> 51:14.600
if his payroll depends on him not being convinced of it, right?

51:14.600 --> 51:16.280
So I think things like that are...

51:17.000 --> 51:20.040
The thing I'm really excited about with what Elon's doing with Twitter,

51:20.040 --> 51:24.920
and I'm just ecstatic about this, is to have the context now.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.400
So you'll have a politician making a claim,

51:27.400 --> 51:29.160
and they're going to word it in certain ways.

51:29.160 --> 51:31.480
My favorite example is when people are like,

51:31.480 --> 51:36.200
if you look at the years 2002 to 2020, terrorism in America,

51:36.200 --> 51:38.520
it's like, did anything happen in 2001?

51:38.520 --> 51:41.800
Is there a reason you just coincidentally started in 2002?

51:41.800 --> 51:42.840
Things like that.

51:42.840 --> 51:47.400
So when people are manipulating things to force an outcome that they want

51:47.400 --> 51:50.040
and to promote an idea that they want disingenuously,

51:50.040 --> 51:52.360
to have that underneath that in Twitter now,

51:52.440 --> 51:57.720
where the audience provides context, I think is something extremely useful,

51:58.600 --> 52:01.560
and it's a great way to nip propaganda in the bud.

52:01.560 --> 52:04.920
And propaganda pervades the entire political spectrum, of course.

52:05.880 --> 52:09.160
The interesting thing about Twitter is also the discussion about free speech and so on.

52:09.160 --> 52:13.960
I think it's interesting to discuss free speech and the freedom of the press

52:13.960 --> 52:15.560
from the context of the Soviet Union.

52:15.560 --> 52:16.060
Sure.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.400
Let's return to the October Revolution and Lenin.

52:22.760 --> 52:24.200
What was the October Revolution?

52:24.840 --> 52:25.560
Who was Lenin?

52:25.560 --> 52:28.680
What are some interesting aspects of this human being

52:28.680 --> 52:32.680
and also this moment in history that stand out to you that are important to understand?

52:32.680 --> 52:40.760
I think the interesting thing about Lenin is he was a zealot,

52:41.560 --> 52:45.320
and he was a visionary, and he really kind of meant it.

52:45.960 --> 52:52.200
And I'm skipping ahead a little bit, but Lenin also was someone who was strategic.

52:52.760 --> 52:55.800
So at a certain point when they were trying to advance

52:55.800 --> 52:59.720
communism throughout the Soviet Union and the costs were outweighing the benefits,

52:59.720 --> 53:01.080
he did a strategic retreat.

53:01.080 --> 53:02.840
He did the new economic policy.

53:02.840 --> 53:06.040
You had a rise of kind of these small capitalists coming back.

53:06.040 --> 53:07.240
You could hire people again.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.640
And for the hardcore people in the Soviet Union, hardcore communists,

53:11.640 --> 53:13.000
this was a huge betrayal.

53:13.000 --> 53:13.880
It's a step back.

53:14.520 --> 53:17.800
He didn't do it because he was some kind of crypto-capitalist.

53:17.800 --> 53:20.920
He did it because he's like, all right, we know where we got to get to,

53:20.920 --> 53:24.120
but we have to go at a certain pace and we have to adjust as we go along.

53:24.120 --> 53:29.240
So to have someone who is that much of an ideologue and that much of a visionary,

53:29.240 --> 53:37.560
but still to have any element of pragmatism to him is, I think, a very rare combination.

53:37.560 --> 53:40.520
And that pragmatism, do you think that's ultimately where things go wrong?

53:43.160 --> 53:45.640
That's where you sacrifice the ideas.

53:45.640 --> 53:50.360
Pragmatism in this case was good because by taking a step back,

53:51.080 --> 53:56.360
he kind of gave himself some breathing room to allow the revolution to continue,

53:56.360 --> 53:57.720
to win the civil war.

53:57.720 --> 54:02.520
There was a big moment where Germany, there's lots of funny anecdotes that I learned while

54:02.520 --> 54:03.400
researching this book.

54:03.400 --> 54:11.560
So Germany and Russia, they were negotiating a ceasefire because Germany wanted Russia out

54:11.560 --> 54:12.280
of the war.

54:12.280 --> 54:16.040
And basically, Germany was like, all right, we'll let you leave,

54:16.040 --> 54:19.240
but you have to sign this treaty and basically hand over all this land

54:19.240 --> 54:20.600
that we're currently occupying.

54:20.680 --> 54:23.960
It was just parts of Ukraine, parts of Poland.

54:23.960 --> 54:26.360
And Lenin tells Trotsky to stall.

54:26.360 --> 54:31.320
He's just run the clock because he was of the belief that now that they've taken power

54:31.320 --> 54:33.800
in Russia, you're going to have a worldwide workers revolution.

54:33.800 --> 54:35.480
So he's like, just stall them.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.960
And he stalled, he stalled, and at a certain point, Germany's like, all right,

54:37.960 --> 54:40.360
you're signing this tomorrow or we're invading.

54:40.360 --> 54:45.560
And Trotsky basically said, yeah, so we're leaving the war, but we're not signing anything.

54:45.560 --> 54:47.080
And the Germans are like, what?

54:47.080 --> 54:48.680
And he's like, yeah, well, that's what we're doing.

54:49.560 --> 54:56.120
And basically, eventually, he had to sign the treaty and seed huge parts of land

54:56.120 --> 54:57.640
and a lot of money.

54:57.640 --> 55:03.400
And this was a very precarious moment for him to maintain control of Russia.

55:03.960 --> 55:08.120
And people were telling him, you've lost huge amounts of territory.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.120
You've blown it.

55:10.120 --> 55:11.240
You should be in jail.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.680
And he's like, watch your mouth, because if you look forward to the future,

55:14.680 --> 55:17.880
it'll be clear which one of us is more likely to be the one ending up in jail.

55:17.880 --> 55:18.760
And he was absolutely right.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.480
This was Trotsky or Lenin saying?

55:21.480 --> 55:23.000
This was Lenin saying this to Karl Radek.

55:24.280 --> 55:26.120
So who are these figures here?

55:26.120 --> 55:26.920
Who's Trotsky?

55:26.920 --> 55:27.960
Who's Lenin?

55:27.960 --> 55:28.760
Who's Stalin?

55:28.760 --> 55:31.720
What are some interesting aspects of all of this?

55:31.720 --> 55:36.680
Would it sort of just to linger on it, the personalities, the ideas that were important?

55:37.240 --> 55:39.800
Well, Trotsky came late to Bolshevism.

55:39.800 --> 55:44.120
He was really the brains in many ways of the October Revolution.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.040
He was an amazing strategist.

55:46.040 --> 55:50.360
He never forgot that he was an amazing strategist, had a very high opinion of himself.

55:50.360 --> 55:54.600
And by the way, the October Revolution, 1917, that's a key moment.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.480
Of course, the Russian Revolution lasted a long time,

56:00.120 --> 56:07.720
but this was a key moment of a phase shift towards success of the Bolsheviks.

56:07.720 --> 56:08.520
Well, that was the moment.

56:08.520 --> 56:10.760
That was like, all right, we are the government now.

56:10.760 --> 56:14.280
And now we have to make it's, you know, like Thomas Jefferson said,

56:14.280 --> 56:17.960
I think it was Thomas Jefferson or no, it's Ben Franklin, a republic, if you can keep it.

56:17.960 --> 56:21.400
It's like, all right, we've made our own kind of government if we can keep it.

56:21.400 --> 56:22.280
Because that was the big question.

56:22.280 --> 56:23.640
You had an international blockade.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.440
You had the white armies and the czarist forces who want to restore

56:26.440 --> 56:30.840
czarism or at least the parliament from right before Lenin took over.

56:30.840 --> 56:36.680
So this was a big kind of no one's was, you know, in some ways it was like the 2016 election.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.520
It's like, all right, we vote in Trump.

56:39.240 --> 56:40.600
Well, what's this going to look like?

56:41.320 --> 56:44.680
No one had any idea what a Trump presidency was going to look like.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.840
All we knew was this guy's on Twitter running his mouth.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.080
He's insulting people and he's had all these views.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.360
Some are over here, some over there.

56:50.360 --> 56:53.240
And the funny thing is the Russians hacked both elections.

56:55.720 --> 56:56.760
That's true.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.840
It was Putin and the gremlin.

56:58.840 --> 57:02.520
So Trotsky was, you know, Lenin's right-hand man.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.800
And he was, you know, enormous.

57:05.800 --> 57:15.320
And to this day, he remains this kind of figure who is supposedly a less authoritarian,

57:15.960 --> 57:20.760
anti-Stalinist version of communism that people can endorse.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.200
And Stalin, of course, was Lenin's successor.

57:24.200 --> 57:28.760
At first there was a triumvirate running Russia as Lenin was recuperating from strokes.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.080
Then very quickly, not very quickly, but gradually.

57:31.080 --> 57:35.160
And then suddenly Stalin became an absolute dictator and he had a series of

57:36.440 --> 57:41.720
purges and so on and so forth, which solidified his control over the country.

57:41.720 --> 57:48.040
And of course, for Stalin, Trotsky later, but throughout, as you write,

57:48.040 --> 57:51.080
seemed to almost take on a supernatural character,

57:51.080 --> 57:56.200
wherein everything that went wrong in the USSR was due not just to his views,

57:56.200 --> 57:58.600
but to his direct orders from abroad.

57:58.600 --> 58:04.520
And of course, George Orwell brilliantly, in probably my favorite book of his,

58:04.520 --> 58:13.160
which is Animal Farm, and also in 1984, portrayed Trotsky as a snowball in Animal Farm and

58:13.160 --> 58:16.200
Emmanuel Goldstein in 1984.

58:16.200 --> 58:19.640
It's this embodiment of this evil that will always have to be fighting.

58:20.200 --> 58:24.200
And you need that in order to hold onto power.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.960
You always have to have that enemy.

58:25.960 --> 58:30.120
Right. So, I mean, that's something I talk about in The White Pill as well.

58:30.120 --> 58:33.960
When things start going wrong, they always have to have scapegoats, right?

58:33.960 --> 58:35.720
And there's this Russian anecdote.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.680
What the Russians like to do is you can't say things out loud,

58:38.680 --> 58:41.800
but if you make jokes, you can say unspeakable truths.

58:41.800 --> 58:46.760
And there's this one anecdote where there's a Russian leader and things are going bad.

58:46.760 --> 58:50.600
And he looks in his drawer and there were two letters from his predecessor.

58:50.600 --> 58:54.760
And he opens the first letter in a panic and the letter says—for advice—and the letter says,

58:54.760 --> 58:56.040
blame everything on me.

58:56.040 --> 58:58.680
So he goes out there and he's like, oh, my predecessor sucked.

58:58.680 --> 58:59.720
He was terrible. Blah, blah.

58:59.720 --> 59:00.360
It's his fault.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.480
And everyone's like, okay.

59:01.480 --> 59:02.840
And then there's a calamity again.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.800
And he's like, oh, crap.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.080
So he goes back at his desk and he reads the second one and it says,

59:07.080 --> 59:08.600
sit down and write two letters.

59:08.600 --> 59:14.360
So when things start going wrong as they constantly did throughout the history of the

59:14.360 --> 59:21.080
Soviet Union or any totalitarian, authoritarian country, someone has to be to blame.

59:21.080 --> 59:26.280
Since we know that our ideology is true and scientifically true,

59:26.280 --> 59:30.360
if it's not working in reality, given the perfection of the ideology,

59:30.360 --> 59:36.280
someone must be intentionally undermining it and causing the disconnect between thought

59:36.280 --> 59:37.320
and reality.

59:37.320 --> 59:40.280
And in the Soviet Union, there were—I think it was the Kulaks at one point,

59:40.280 --> 59:43.080
then it was the Wreckers, the Doctors.

59:43.080 --> 59:48.120
It was just different—there was always someone—And Trotsky was called a fascist

59:48.120 --> 59:51.080
and was accused of plotting with Hitler and all this other stuff.

59:51.720 --> 59:56.680
And you also write, the problem with communism is that eventually you run out of possible

59:56.680 --> 59:57.960
scapeboats.

59:57.960 --> 59:59.080
Scapeboats.

59:59.160 --> 59:59.880
Scapeboats.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.840
You run out of boats.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.760
You do run out of boats.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.800
Who's going to carry them?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.000
Eventually you run out of possible scapegoats.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.120
It's my second language, this English thing.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.560
I'm a failed podcaster.

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.520
I'm a failure.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:23.960
Eventually you run out of possible scapegoats for failure, at which point acknowledging

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.360
or even noticing that something was wrong itself becomes a form of treason.

01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:31.320
So I saw that in North Korea, right?

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.600
Wherever you went in North Korea, something was wrong.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.040
So if you have four buttons for the elevator, one would be mismatched.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.720
Every wall had a crack.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.000
Every floor had a stain.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.000
The bathroom would be rusted through when you wanted to flush the urinal.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.920
But if you are someone who points this out, you're a troublemaker.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.920
And you're—Oh, you're saying something's wrong.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.680
You're criticizing the operation.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.440
First of all, you're threatening the person who's in charge because now they're

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.760
incompetent and now that's a big red flag for them.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.840
But second, if you're just going around saying this is wrong, this is wrong,

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.200
this is wrong, even if it's objectively true, you're a troublemaker and you're

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.480
a counterrevolutionary.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.160
So at a certain point, everyone just has to put on blinders and pretend that

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.200
everything is fine.

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.040
One example I use in the book, an extreme example, was there was a photography

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:20.600
professor and he pointed out to his class, and he was an older man, that before the

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.200
revolution, the quality of photographic paper was better and he was, I think,

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.120
executed for this heresy.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.960
So yeah, you have to pretend there was—I'm reading a book right now about the

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:35.320
Chinese Cultural Revolution and there was an academic—I forget his name,

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:40.120
Hu Shi, I think—and he points out that in these countries, not only do you not

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.080
have freedom of speech, you don't have freedom of silence.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.440
You can't just sit there quietly.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:47.160
You have to say how great things are and how much you're enjoying and how

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.440
wonderful they are instead of just keeping quiet because if you keep quiet,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.160
that's suspicious.

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:54.200
They're always singing those songs about how happy they are and how great

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.000
everything is.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.320
And if everyone else is singing, who are you to not sing?

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.560
Yeah, those pictures, especially when it's Stalin giving speeches and everyone

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:11.800
is applauding, any dictator, you don't want to be the first person that stops

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:12.520
applauding.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.560
Stalin had to have a button, is my understanding, at a certain point to tell

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.320
people to stop applauding because I'm not the first person to stop applauding.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.680
Because like you said, if you're the first one to stop clapping, people are

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.480
going to notice.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.680
And why did you stop clapping?

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.480
You don't like Stalin?

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.440
Just imagine being one of those people clapping.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.200
That's the thing.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.480
They always had a sword over their head, but they all had a lot of blood on

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.200
their hands, too.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.640
It's a very, very precarious life.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.960
But there's also—I mean, 1984 does a good job of this.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.040
What is that, like two minutes of hate or something like this?

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.320
You lose yourself in the hysteria of it.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:57.720
So there's some level of which, at first, you're sacrificing your basic

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:03.480
individualistic ability to think, but then you get lost in this kind of wave of

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.640
emotion and you give into it.

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:09.640
You allow yourself—it's like a mix of fear and then anger, and then you direct

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.200
that anger towards like Snowball or Trotsky or whoever.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.760
And like, what is that?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.960
You're also losing yourself in the crowd because you're like, it's not just

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.440
I'm angry.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.120
Everyone I know, we're all angry together.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.320
So you really are becoming a part of something bigger than yourself and having

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.360
this kind of communal, very primal, emotional experience.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.320
It's like the opposite of Christmas, right?

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.240
Christmas, we're all together.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.680
Everyone's sharing their joy.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.120
Everyone's sharing their love.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.200
This is the opposite, literally the opposite.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.400
Everyone's together sharing their hate and anger and rage, but you're all kind

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.600
of having a mind meld.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:49.320
But I wonder what it's like to be an independent thinker in those moments.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.760
Like, allow yourself to think.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.680
Well, we know because there were a lot of them and they were all punished

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.320
enormously.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.400
They can be noticed.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.280
You can notice them.

01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:58.760
Oh, yeah.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.880
You even notice it in America.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.240
America's a free country, but when people start asking too many questions, it's

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.760
like, where are you going with this?

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:09.400
You know, like if you're in an office even in a corporate setting, you're a

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.040
troublemaker.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.120
You're just, you know, you're making problems for everyone.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.560
Why can't you be normal?

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:15.640
Why can't you be just like everybody else?

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:22.680
So people do not like having to be made to think and they certainly despise

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.320
having to be made to justify themselves because that's a threat to their status

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:27.960
and to their power.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.120
And this applies in totalitarianism or applies to, you know, Dunder Mifflin.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:36.440
I still can't believe you're wearing lipstick.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:37.580
I'm not.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.360
Goes to show you can pull lipstick on a pig.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.520
It's like a snowball.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.520
I think you've just been on a bender.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:55.160
That's what I think.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:55.960
It's been rough.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.920
It's been rough.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.640
It's been rough.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.800
I feel kind of, I feel like I can be myself in this outfit.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:09.720
Like I honestly feel like I could just go around in this outfit and just be

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.360
weird because everyone will accept you.

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.080
If you're wearing a Santa outfit, like you can say anything in a Santa outfit.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.320
Right?

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.680
Have you seen Bad Santa?

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.520
You can't say anything like flux stick.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.120
How did Stalin come to power?

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:32.040
If we return back to those early days, post the October revolution,

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.440
Lenin and Trotsky and Stalin, how did he come to power?

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.640
So what Stalin did very cleverly, Stalin was, you know, he worked the system.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.120
But he was very much in the background.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.440
And what he did better than Trotsky is he was much more a politician.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:49.800
He was a gladhander.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.960
He made friends within the party.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.040
He made people feel respected and appreciated.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.880
And Lenin trusted him.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.680
After Lenin's stroke, Stalin was basically the one who was keeping track of him.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.360
Lenin asked Stalin at one point to kill him because after the strokes,

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.240
he was incapacitated.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.280
Stalin talked him out of it.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.200
But at the same time, Lenin was like, if I need someone killed,

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.640
this is who I need to talk to.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.080
Stalin, if you look up photos of him when he was young, he was a stud.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.880
He was a gangster.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.760
He's a bank robber.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:22.120
And he basically worked the system.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:26.440
And you had the Trotskyites on one hand who were much more to the left.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.600
Stalin's big, I would guess I would call it a heresy,

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.200
was he put forth the idea of socialism in one country.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.880
Whereas we're just going to make it work here in what became the Soviet Union.

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:41.160
The Trotsky idea, and this is really kind of the Marxist idea,

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.560
is that the workers' revolution has to be worldwide.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.240
This is just a worldwide kind of new era of humanity,

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.400
where Stalin's like, no, no, no, we're just going to make it here

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.280
and then later behind what became the Iron Curtain.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:56.360
But this was, sure, this was an ideological division between the two.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.720
But what happens in totalitarian countries,

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.240
it happens in any kind of like, you know,

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.680
when you have intermingling of like religion and government,

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.080
things that are like ideological disputes, like the Aryan heresy.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.920
The Aryan heresy in Christianity is that Christ is subordinate to God the Father, right?

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:17.880
Whereas the contemporary Orthodox version, it's one God and three person, excuse me.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:21.240
So they're all co-equal aspects of God in heaven.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:23.720
But that was an excuse to be like, you guys are evil,

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.320
you're on the side of the devil, we're going to kill you.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:31.640
So these little disputes about ideas are often a convenient cover

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.720
for people to have a power struggle in the guise of being like,

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.320
it's not that I'm about wanting to be more powerful,

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.160
I'm just on the side of the truth and you're speaking lies

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.880
and that's dangerous to the revolution or to the true faith.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.400
So he squeezed Trotsky, but the thing is Trotsky had the seeds of his own defeat

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:50.600
because per Trotsky, the party is always right.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:52.760
You cannot be right against the party, right?

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.320
So if you have this kind of party structure and the party is saying,

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:01.080
you're wrong, as an individual, you are wrong.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.240
Because the collective is what makes decisions.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:08.200
The collective, the workers are who have the knowledge and the information.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:14.040
And it is important for you to kind of subordinate your selfishness,

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.440
your individualism to this greater good.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.920
So he kind of set himself up in many ways.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.200
Is it clear to you why Trotsky lost that power struggle?

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.680
So you just explained that he set himself up,

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:34.440
but you can see how different ideologies can be used to achieve different ends.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:37.160
Is there another alternative possible trajectory

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.960
where Trotsky could have been the head of the Soviet Union?

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.240
It would be very hard because he was Jewish.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:47.160
So when they were seizing power, Trotsky explicitly said,

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.760
I can't be in charge, I'm Jewish.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.880
So the Soviet Union remained extremely anti-Semitic.

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:55.480
One of the reasons so many Jews became communists in the Soviet Union

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.440
because the promise was once the communists took over,

01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.880
we're not going to have pogroms anymore.

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.880
Pogroms was you had these Jewish ghettos,

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.560
and under the permission or encouragement of the czar,

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:11.800
just gangs of people go through killing, raping, robbing, stealing, rioting for days,

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.720
and just a complete massacre.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.520
And the idea is like under communism, everyone's going to be equal.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.640
We're not going to have this anymore.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.720
They still had it, but to a lesser extent.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.760
But since Trotsky was Jewish, his real name is Lev Bronstein,

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:31.080
you can't, it was almost impossible to have a scenario where he was going to be in charge.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.240
And Stalin fed into that to some extent.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.400
Also this kind of idea of Jewish internationalism.

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.960
It's like, okay, he doesn't really have loyalty to Russia.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.720
And many of the people who were Jewish, who were high up in Stalin's

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.120
government administration, they very much had to prove their loyalty

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:51.240
to communism as opposed to Judaism.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.560
Throughout the 20th century, what was the relationship between communism

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.640
and Jews in the Soviet Union?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:05.480
In terms of antisemitism, the ups and downs of antisemitism,

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:12.280
it seems like it was lesser and greater in different parts of the 20th century.

01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:19.640
Well, it's the kind of thing where if something was bad, there's this Russian rhyme.

01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:27.080
If there's no water in the sink, who drank it?

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.640
All the Jews.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.520
So if something goes wrong, there's just a convenient historical scapegoat.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.960
It's the Jews' fault.

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:37.800
So this is something that's towards the end of his life very much.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.560
And this was after World War II.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.320
Stalin was getting ready for another kind of series of programs.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:45.960
All these Jews were getting kicked out of their jobs.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.880
Jewish doctors were getting sent to the Far East instead of being in cities.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.040
The newspapers started talking about rootless cosmopolitans, which was a term the Nazis also

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.960
used to kind of regard Jews as others or as aliens.

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.560
And they were very clever about it.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.000
In Pravda, there were articles, letters to the editor.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.680
They were like, you know, things are getting so antisemitic,

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:18.520
we really should round up all the Jews and send them elsewhere for their own safety.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:24.200
So they were kind of setting the ground rules or the basis

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.080
to have this sort of program come back.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.760
But spoiler alert, Stalin dies.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.560
And immediately, all of this gets reversed and the new administration

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.640
rehabilitates the doctors who were accused of trying to hurt him and all this other sort of thing.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.360
What is it about the scapegoats in society?

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.360
Are we always going to be looking for scapegoats?

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.960
What do you learn from human nature that this seems to keep happening?

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.320
I think there's a book called The Nurture Assumption.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520
And I discussed this in the New Right.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:03.800
And what the author learned is that humans define themselves by opposition.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.960
So if you have a group of people and it's kids and adults,

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.560
the kids will see themselves as kids because we're as opposed to adults.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:15.960
If the adults leave, the kids see themselves as boys and girls

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.320
because I'm not a girl, I'm a boy.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.840
I'm not a boy, I'm a girl.

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:19.960
So they divide.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.880
So this idea, which is a very lefty idea,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.760
that human beings naturally all get along is not accurate.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:29.880
And the best example of this is look after 9-11.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.240
Look where there's a war.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:32.600
Nothing unites a population.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:36.280
It's not like when times are thriving that everyone's all working together.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.280
When things are bad and there's an enemy.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.160
The Japanese are Pearl Harbor.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.360
It's Al-Qaeda.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.680
That's when everyone really comes together

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.920
because now we have someone to be against.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.400
So there will always be someone has to be the out-group

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:54.280
and we have to be the in-group as opposed to them.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:01.560
But there's a viciousness to the actions you take towards the out-group

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.640
that varies throughout history.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:10.120
The degree of viciousness can cross the line towards atrocities, towards genocide.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:10.600
Right.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.480
That's the question of why does it sometimes do that?

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.560
Why does it sometimes cross into genocide?

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:22.600
I understand it's a useful thing to have the other to blame in this world,

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.360
especially when times are rough.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:30.600
But why does that sometimes lead to sort of action that says I'm going to murder?

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.320
Well, I think the question really is why sometimes it doesn't.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:35.640
Right.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:38.520
And one of the things I learned when I was doing The New Right

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.160
is a lot of the Nazis, using the term loosely speaking, neo-Nazis,

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.800
they make the point that like, oh, when the Holocaust happened,

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.480
it really wasn't that big of a deal and that only became a big deal in the decades later.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.320
And this just shows the power of Jewish influence.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:55.080
And I'm like, this to me is a great thing.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.520
It's a great thing that we sat down pretty recently, historically,

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:06.440
and we're like, wait a minute, guys, when we have a war or we have conquest,

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.000
you don't have to just start killing everyone.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.320
This is something that's bad and wrong.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.240
And certainly in the last 60 years, 70 years,

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.720
this is something that people have come to take for granted.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.000
But that wasn't the case before.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.360
It would always be, or not always, but often, if you conquer,

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:26.520
you just go wild and just start slaughtering masses of people.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.320
Who's the guy from Harvard?

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:33.480
Steven Pinker.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.520
I'm sorry, I forgot his name.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:39.560
So he just talks about like, you know, this is one of the reasons also why

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.840
there was so much skepticism when the Holocaust started

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.400
because this was regarded as something that was barbaric.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.840
This is from the Middle Ages, from the biblical times.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.800
We don't do this anymore.

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.320
We're civilized now.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:55.960
So genocide is historically the norm.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:01.320
I think it's also harder to pull it off emotionally when you have the visuals

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.600
and when you have the audio and when you have the voices

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.040
of the people being slaughtered.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.400
We don't know, you know, if this was 2000 years ago

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.760
and people, you know, in the Bible, they go kill this group, go kill that group.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.560
We don't have their names.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.440
We don't have the visuals.

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.400
We don't have anything.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:21.000
But when you see someone being like, you know, there's a book about,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.800
I think the Rwandan genocide and the title is,

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.600
We regret to inform you that tomorrow we will be executed with all of our families like a telegram.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.520
And like when you get a telegram like this,

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:33.320
it's very different than reading some history book about,

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.480
you know, the Assyrians killed the Phoenicians.

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.360
It's like, I don't know who this is.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.880
I don't know who that is, right?

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.120
So I think this is something that has changed very recently.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.640
There was this kind of interesting moment just that speaks to

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.880
the way technology has liberated people from violence.

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.320
Kristallnacht, which was a moment in the lead up to the Holocaust,

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:58.360
were basically, you know, with Hitler's blessing,

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:02.040
you had a nationwide burning of Jewish businesses,

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.840
synagogues burnt down, and Kaiser Wilhelm, you know, the Kaiser,

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:09.400
he said, for the first time in my life, I'm embarrassed to be a German.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.640
But that was a moment where worldwide,

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.160
even plenty of people who did not think very highly of Jewish people were like,

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.840
this is a wrap.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.760
This is a complete nightmare.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.920
But 200 years ago, 100 years ago, maybe not literally Kristallnacht,

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:29.240
but there's an out group and we hate them and we're going to kill them and it's fine.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.600
And you think it's even more difficult now with the internet to do that kind of thing?

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.160
Yes.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:37.960
Now, more difficult doesn't mean it doesn't happen or it can't happen.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.320
I'm not saying that at all.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:44.040
But I'm saying that we know a lot about what's going on in North Korea,

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:46.200
you know, probably the most secretive country on earth.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.560
There's a lot of atrocities in Eritrea, which is kind of known.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:54.280
So I think it's also, like, if you think about it,

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:58.760
how many years ago, 300 years ago, you only know the people in your village

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.160
and they're all probably going to look like you, so on and so forth.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:05.080
Whereas now, if I'm on social media and there's someone from any country

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.600
and maybe their picture looks a little different,

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.600
they use the same anime picture as somebody else,

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:12.440
but they're putting forth their ideas, you do see the humanity in them.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:17.240
And you do see a sense of familiarity and a familial bond with them.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.480
And when you hear about these things, you know, again, like I did when I did Dear Reader,

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:25.160
no one, I was on Al-Qaeda and I was on Alex Jones,

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:29.080
no one pushed back about, like, oh, the North Koreans.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.840
They were all like, this is horrible.

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.720
If I had a magic wand, I'd give them food.

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.320
I wouldn't have them live in fear.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.280
And this is something that I don't think was the case a couple hundred years ago.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.320
As I said, I'd love to get your thoughts about what's going on in Iran, the protests.

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:50.200
It seems like the regime there is able to crack down on violence.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.960
My thoughts about Iran, let me just, there's something else about Iran which I think is interesting.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.840
This whole idea of care for what you wish for.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.160
Because people have this, and something I kind of, one of the reasons I have the white pill

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.840
is Americans really are very naive about the nature of evil, right?

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.720
They really think that a dictator has a weird mustache and he's banging the table

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.120
and he's, you know, like a crazy person.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.640
And it's often not the case.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:19.640
But they also think if something is bad, therefore, the alternative is going to be better.

01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:27.320
So you had the Shah of Iran and he was kind of authoritarian and no, he's not a good guy.

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:31.800
So in 1979, there were a lot of people like, this guy's horrible.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.480
He's oppressing the Iranian people.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.760
Let's get him the F out of there.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:40.120
He's so bad that whatever comes after it has to be an improvement.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.760
And it's like, no, that's, if you think, I mean, this drives me crazy

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.920
when conservatives are like, you know, Joe Biden's the worst president we ever had.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.360
This is destroying America.

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.680
I'm like, you have no idea how bad things can get.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:19:01.000
The fact that you are in a position to complain means we've got a ways to go.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:02.520
Yeah.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:06.840
Every time you say that Donald Trump or Joe Biden is the worst president ever,

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:12.040
that warms my heart because you're allowed to say that.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:12.440
Yes.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:12.680
Yeah.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.480
It's like, I just let it, it's like music

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.320
because you're, you're allowed to be pretty in response to a president's tweet.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.360
You couldn't write that.

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.000
Yeah.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:23.640
Yeah.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.640
And it still lives there and it's, and nobody arrests you.

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:28.440
Yeah.

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.400
Which is a rare thing in human history.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:31.800
Yes.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.400
And still rare thing in the world.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:40.840
I mean, it does seem that Iran, the current regime is able to crack down on communication channels.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:47.640
It's still, it's surprising to me how much power government can have.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.000
Like they could use violence to control the population.

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:51.800
Right.

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.360
And nobody's going to do anything about it.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:55.800
Well, I just-

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.800
The rest of the world just watches.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.880
But here's the thing, right?

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.600
Because if the rest of the world starts doing too much,

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.640
then they have a justification to crack down even more.

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:08.360
This regime, this protests are not legitimate.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.280
These are, this happened constantly in the Soviet Union.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.560
These are foreign provocateurs.

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.760
This is meddling in our country.

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.360
Curfew, lockdown, mandatory searches.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.480
Everyone's a spy.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:25.000
So that narrative is a very convenient one for people who are authoritarian.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.800
I know a lot of people who are Persian, as I'm sure you do as well.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.800
Very hardworking, very bright, great people.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:41.880
And, you know, all you could do is hope for a peaceful liberalization of-

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:45.160
People don't realize how liberal Iran used to be.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:49.640
Andy Warhol, Andy Warhol used to be friends with the Shah.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:53.720
And if you read his diaries, he talks about how he knew things weren't going well for the Shah

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.640
because they had less caviar at the table.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.240
But like this is, he was really kind of, there's,

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:04.840
there's I think a poor understanding in America, and I'm not sure why,

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.600
of what these liberal Muslim countries are like.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:13.880
I gave a talk in Bodrum in Turkey, which is like a resort town in Turkey.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:20.280
And I had thought previous to that, or I had suspected, if push comes to shove and they have

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:24.920
to choose people in Turkey between the West and like Al-Qaeda, not Al-Qaeda, but like, you know,

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.880
hardcore Islam, they're going to choose hardcore Islam.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.080
You go there and you're like, oh, this is like Los Angeles.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.880
Like these people are so liberal, so, and they're the first to be killed.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.400
They're the first targets.

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.920
So that people like that in Iran are who my thoughts are.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.920
And with the, I got to tell you, like nothing makes me more of a feminist

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:50.760
than seeing the women in countries like this fight for the right to education,

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.840
the right to dress as they please.

01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.040
Maybe we don't need them driving, but you know, that's okay.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.800
There he is with that characteristic, brilliant humor

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:09.560
that you're so loved for and should probably be banned for on Twitter.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.760
I'm doing my best.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:15.240
Every time you tweet, I just report, report, report, please stop this man.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:16.920
You don't have like a script.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:18.760
Exactly.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.600
Well, funny enough, I do.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.840
But I don't, I don't abuse my power.

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.480
I wear the ring like Frodo.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.640
And I respect the power.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.680
But you look like Gollum.

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.360
That's not what your mom said last night.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.320
She said you're hung like Gollum.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.520
I'm not going down that road with you.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:45.320
I'm not holding hands one another time.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.800
I learned my, fool me once.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:48.300
Okay.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.040
My close childhood friend is from Iran.

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:52.440
Oh, wow.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:52.920
Okay.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.760
And I talked to him a lot.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.320
I wanted to go to Iran.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.280
But it's so far away.

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.680
I can see it from my house, my friend.

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.600
I would love to take that trip even now.

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.960
It's just culturally.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:15.160
So all the different little pockets of local cultures that make up Iran.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.000
I just heard so many amazing things.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.120
Yeah, my friend Paul went there.

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.320
He had an amazing time.

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.280
He just absolutely loved it.

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.320
He thought the people were awesome.

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.680
It was so interesting, very developed.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.640
Just like Tehran is, the history in Tehran is insane.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.280
Yeah, I would really love to visit.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.320
Now we return back.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.640
I don't know how we ended up in Iran.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.600
But let us let us stroll back to Stalin taking power.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.400
What role did the suppression of speech, the censorship,

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:54.360
the suppression of the freedom of the press have in Stalin taking hold, taking power?

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:58.040
In Lenin, in Trotsky, in Stalin having power?

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:04.120
Well, it was a very useful mechanism to direct public opinion

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.080
and inform public perspectives and everything.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:12.680
So first of all, there was a lot of news about how great things were.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.480
You have a bumper crop here, grains never better.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:20.920
There's another anecdote where President Kalinin is talking about how

01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:27.480
on Karl Marx Street in Kharkiv, there's all sorts of new skyscrapers being built

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.680
and it's just absolutely amazing.

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.280
Some of the audience gets up and goes,

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.160
comrade, I work on Karl Marx Street.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.120
I walk there every day.

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.400
There's none of these skyscrapers.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.920
It goes, see, that's your problem.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.680
You're trusting your eyes instead of reading something and learning what's in the papers.

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:42.920
So there was this kind of disconnect between,

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.240
you probably know the joke,

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.840
Pravda ni pravda i zvieste ni zvieste.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.040
Pravda means truth, but there's no truth to be had and pravda is kind of the Russian line.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.280
The point is it very much, and the other thing,

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.120
my mom wasn't particularly politically motivated,

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:09.000
but she talked about how you didn't have to be smart to realize how dishonest it was

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.480
because one day someone is the great hero of the Soviet people

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.280
and the next week he's been a traitor and a class enemy and the worst,

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.560
and then sometimes they reverted and it's like, okay,

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.040
they couldn't even keep their story straight.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.720
In fact, at a certain point when Gorbachev liberalized,

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.960
they had to cancel tests because the history books had to be rewritten so quickly.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:39.000
The thing also with these newspapers is it was very monotonous

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.600
because you had the same message over and over.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.480
A lot of these papers were about kind of speaking to the lowest common denominator,

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:50.840
Stalin's great, everything's great, overseas bad.

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:56.440
So it very much was about not informing but creating

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.760
a certain perspective in the public at large.

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:06.920
And also you were educated as a citizen on what you're supposed to think and say.

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:13.400
So a lot of this was this kind of private truth, public lies situation.

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:16.600
So you could read the paper and at your factory,

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.720
you could be like, oh my God, this guy, Karl Roddick's great.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.160
He's like, oh my God, yeah, he's amazing.

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.880
You knew what to talk about and you knew how to look at it as well.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.400
And then when you get home, you could just kind of be more honest with family.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.200
But the question is to which degree does this propaganda

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.640
and this ideology infiltrate your actual thinking?

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:40.120
You give examples as scientists in infiltrated science.

01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:41.560
Oh, yeah.

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:47.400
So basically, you know, Lisenko is the textbook example, Lisenkoism in biology.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:50.040
So because Marxism is materialist,

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.280
they didn't like the idea that genes pass on from one generation to the next.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.560
So Lisenkoism kind of was a rejection of Mendel and that kind of genetics.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.320
And if you reject genes, you're really going in a bad direction in terms of biology.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.000
The Soviet Union's biological program became an international laughing stock.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.600
At one point, Lisenko claimed he crossed a tomato and a potato.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:21.240
You had things where they said they had nuclear, which is, wait, we have fish in,

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.120
but they said they invented fusion or hard or heavy water or hard water was point being

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:36.280
in cultures like this, your way to achieve status wasn't necessarily about your accomplishments,

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.520
but about your loyalty to orthodoxy.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:43.480
So if you were saying things that got to a result that was congruent

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.560
with the broader ideology as a whole, that was much better as a means of furthering yourself

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.680
in the arts or in the sciences than if you had something that was innovative.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:59.080
If you're innovative, it's like, well, how do I fit this in with the broader ruling ideology?

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.840
The problem with totalitarianism, one of the many problems, is everything, literally everything,

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.960
has to be perceived through the lens of ideology.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:16.920
There were scientists who were arrested or at least fired because of their theories about

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:19.400
sunspot developments because it was regarded as un-Marxist.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:27.640
There was an epidemic and all these horses got sick, and because the vaccine didn't work on the

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.480
horses, the bacteriologists were arrested because they were regarded as wreckers.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:35.560
It's like, we gave you a job, you didn't do it, you're undermining the socialist state.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:42.520
So it's kind of a backward series of incentives, and it's designed to maintain at all costs

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:44.840
the ruling ideological superstructure.

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:49.160
But you draw a small distinction between the ideology and the ideological superstructure

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.360
and the propaganda.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.520
Aren't those kind of intermixed together?

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:56.360
Well, the ideological is like in the sciences and what's true in genetics or what's true

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:56.920
in astronomy.

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.920
That doesn't really percolate out to the masses, right?

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:04.200
So the pravda is maybe covering this scientist is great or these discoveries are great,

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.920
but it's not necessarily the same as day-to-day or glorifying political leaders.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.720
But the pravda is a manifestation of the idea that truth can be conjured up.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:14.120
Yes.

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.600
It can be constructed and it can be altered quickly.

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:22.840
And then I just I wonder sort of 1984 caricatures that I wonder to what degree

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.760
it really could control the way you think that like how many people it affected.

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:32.840
I can give you an example, a very easy one.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:37.880
So again, with regarding North Korea, Kim, the great leader Kim Il-sung,

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:42.680
who was the founder of North Korea, had a tumor on the back of his neck.

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.960
And it was too close to the skull, the spinal column, so they couldn't operate on it.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.560
And throughout his life, it got bigger and bigger.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.000
And I got mixed messages in my research about whether North Koreans knew about it

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.760
because they always photographed him from this angle.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:03.480
And I met a refugee and I asked her, I'm like, did you know that he had this tumor?

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.200
She goes, yeah, yeah.

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:07.240
When people played him in the movies, they would make up there.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.320
And she goes, it was an old war injury.

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:13.800
And I go, why would a war injury get bigger throughout your life?

01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:18.520
And she just stood there and she was like, holy, but she never questioned it.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.920
But it was the kind of thing where they put the idea in her head.

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.520
And since there was no reason to question it,

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:25.480
she just kind of went with it her entire life until I talked to her.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:26.280
Audrey, his name.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.120
Hi, Audrey.

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.960
Hi, Audrey.

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.520
I wonder what percent of the population is like that.

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.160
Here's the thing.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:39.640
If there is a cost to me questioning Lisenko as a great scientist and there's no benefit,

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.200
why wouldn't I just go with what's going to keep me and my family safe?

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:47.160
But I also mean just the psychological.

01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.200
There might be a very local psychological cost.

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.280
So not a cost of going to jail, but a cost like

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.280
you're going to kind of ruin the conversation by bringing it up.

01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:01.800
Kind of like, yeah, I'm just trying to.

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:02.920
It's like Debbie Downer, right?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.120
Yeah.

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.080
But there's also the whole metaphor of like there's two fish in the river.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.160
One says, man, the water is really great today.

01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.760
And the other one goes, what's water?

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:16.680
Like a friend of mine, Adriana, her mom came to the West and they went to the supermarket

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.520
and the mom just in front of all the Fanta.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.040
This is just crying.

01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:21.640
And she's like, what's going on?

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:24.040
She goes, they told us we had more food than you.

01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.440
And when something is, you can, it's, you can under think this story.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.200
This guy's an enemy of the people.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:33.480
He was the hero.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.600
He just offended someone.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:35.400
This is bullshit.

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:41.480
It's almost impossible psychologically to think I'm living in the Truman show

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:49.080
and that everything in the media is not just wrong, but a carefully constructed narrative

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.800
and a lie, like what they're never going to tell the truth.

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:53.480
And how, you know, like what?

01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:56.680
Like you, and even if that were, even if you do understand that,

01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:59.720
how would you even read between the lines to deduce what the truth is?

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:01.880
Yeah, it must've been a strange experience.

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.520
There's stories of soldiers, the Red Army soldiers throughout World War II

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.320
as they go to different countries, even Romania.

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:14.760
But in Europe, just to understand that people live much better

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.200
than they did, than the soldiers did back in the Soviet Union.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.720
And that's why a lot of times when they went back,

01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.680
Stalin had them killed because they saw too much or sent to the camps.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.280
So just to linger on this idea of free speech.

01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:33.080
So there's constant discussion about free speech and this modern debate

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.600
about social media and all that kind of stuff.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.520
What's your take on it?

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:42.520
Grounding it, not in some kind of shallow discussion of free speech we have today,

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.800
but more in the context of

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:52.440
pravda and the suppression of speech in Stalinist Russia.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:57.560
I hate the term free speech because it's used in many different contexts.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.640
I agree with entirely somewhat discreet at all.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.800
I don't think everyone has something to say or something to add to the conversation.

01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:12.200
And I have my locals community and it used to be,

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:17.000
I think the boilerplate language is, come support free speech and free discourse.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.320
And I changed that because I don't like that term.

01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:25.640
Because people will tell you with some reason that, oh, if you block me on Twitter,

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.400
you're voiding my free speech.

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.600
So I don't like that term as a whole.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.480
But one of the points of the white pill and something I see enormous parallels with today,

01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:43.800
if you have one news outlet or three news outlets with identical ideology,

01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:50.600
you're not going to be able to get to any kind of truth or any kind of useful information.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.120
It's all going to be pre-filtered for you.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:55.240
It's like a baby bird and you're eating the mother bird's vomit, right?

01:33:55.800 --> 01:34:00.360
But if you have what we have increasingly now with technology,

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.880
if you have a world where everyone has a camera on their phone,

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:07.960
if you have a world where anyone can put their ideas out there,

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:11.800
maybe they're banned from certain outlets, but they're not literally

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:16.360
vanished like they were in the USSR, that is very healthy.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.760
That is something I'm enormously supportive of because back in the day,

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:23.960
if you only had the TV crews with cameras,

01:34:23.960 --> 01:34:27.640
you could only see what they're capturing and they could edit it.

01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.440
Whereas now, we saw this recently during COVID, right?

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.600
You had these reporters with masks on and they're talking,

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.240
but the cameraman wasn't wearing a mask.

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:42.680
So you'd have the people on the street being like, look, they don't believe it.

01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.920
Or as soon as they would start filming, the guy took the mask off and they'd film them.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.080
They go, you are lying.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.800
You're putting this on for some purpose.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:53.720
Whether you're leaving the thickest sea of masks or not,

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.920
that person clearly does not.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:55.880
It's only putting on for show.

01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.040
Or crimes.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.880
People are anti-police.

01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:04.280
They say, okay, the cop said this.

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.200
Did he draw the gun on this guy necessarily?

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:07.320
So on and so forth.

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:14.200
It is so much better when everyone has access to as much of the information as possible

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.360
and can make that informed decision themselves.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.080
Now, there certainly is space for informed people to be like,

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.760
no, this isn't what it looks like.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:26.440
If you look here, if you look there, it's cropped here, so on and so forth.

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:31.960
But that's still much more useful than just having that 20-second clip

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.120
that someone has decided to edit for you.

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.920
Because everything is so interconnected,

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:42.440
truth, no matter what, has a way of finding its way to the populace.

01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.440
And also, there's a big asymmetry in terms of trust.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:54.600
So if I tell you 100 truths and one lie, that lie is equal—I'm screwed.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.520
Because once you catch me in a—you don't have to kill someone every day to be a murderer, right?

01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.800
You only have to do it once.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.440
So if you catch me in a brazen lie,

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:06.360
you're going to look at everything I say after that with an enormous grain of salt.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.360
So that is another big asymmetry in favor of truth.

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.640
If someone trusts you, you have to be honest all the time,

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:15.160
and you're going to make mistakes.

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.120
You can own those mistakes and be like, hey, this is why I made the mistake,

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.320
this is why I said such and such.

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.880
Okay, but the flip side of that, which has been disheartening to me,

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.040
is that people on the conspiracy side—conspiracy theory side of things,

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:32.600
I've noticed how easy it is to just call something a lie.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:33.400
Yes.

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:35.960
And then that becomes viral.

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:39.000
For some reason, there's a desire for people—yeah,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.560
for anyone who points out that the emperor is not wearing a clothes,

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.400
even when the emperor is fully clothed.

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.960
So I don't know what that is,

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.840
but that really seems to mess with this truth mechanism.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.600
So when it becomes viral to call people a liar,

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:53.880
whether they're a liar or not,

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:57.960
it's like you feel like on unstable ground.

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:03.160
Because to me, that idea of revealing a lie that somebody told

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.800
is a really powerful mechanism to keep people honest.

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:08.360
But when you're misusing it, crying wolf too much.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.400
It seems to break the system.

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.480
It makes me nervous because there's also like—

01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.120
If someone is a liar,

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.440
that doesn't mean literally everything they say is a lie.

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:20.440
No, but what is a lie and what isn't?

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.080
I just noticed that there's money to be made in calling out something as a lie.

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:30.840
It's just the conspiracy theories straight up.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:35.720
The first thing, some traumatic event happened,

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:38.280
give an explanation that's not the mainstream explanation.

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.360
No matter what, whether it's true or lie,

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.800
there's a lot of virality and money to be made in that.

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:47.560
And that makes me nervous because it doesn't matter if it's true or not.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:53.640
Anti-establishment ideas are viral, whether they're true or not.

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:58.280
Sure, but I think establishment ideas are powerful whether they're true or not.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.480
On the whole, I think you're right.

01:38:01.480 --> 01:38:04.360
On the whole, it's good to test the power centers.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:09.640
It just makes me nervous in our attention economy

01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:14.120
that the sexy thing seems to be the anti-establishment message.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.400
And then it feels like that becomes a drug.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.040
Anything the establishment says, anything institutions say,

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.400
anything the mainstream says must be wrong because it comes from the mainstream.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:31.480
I have that line that you're supposed to take one red pill, not the whole bottle.

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.400
I am certainly one of those people who is of the idea that they are dishonest,

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:39.160
far more open that they're honest.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.920
That said, there are people who are of the belief, to use an extreme example,

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:51.000
that Trump is still the shadow president and there's going to be these QAnon mass arrests.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.360
I thought this was something that the Daily Beast made up to make fun of MAGA,

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.840
but I was just on the phone with my buddy last night and he was like,

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.240
if you go to Truth Central, they're all over there.

01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:04.360
And if you disagree with them, they call you controlled opposition

01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.960
or a grifter or so on and so forth.

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.560
Is it on 4chan or where?

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:10.200
Truth Central, Trump's social media outlet.

01:39:10.200 --> 01:39:12.440
Oh, Truth Central, no, Truth Social.

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.760
Yeah, but he forgot the name of it himself.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.440
So he's like, that's why I had to create a joke.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:18.840
You got to explain the jokes, you got to explain the jokes.

01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.720
You do like the way Twitter puts that context.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:26.840
You got to do the joke and then pause and turn to the camera and explain.

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.720
And have a laugh track.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.800
Yeah, so people know where the jokes are.

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:31.000
That's real humor.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.080
Yeah, and then we just clap.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.520
And then everybody clapped.

01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.440
I think for the last two years, especially vis-a-vis COVID,

01:39:40.440 --> 01:39:45.320
the overwhelming message was the experts know what they're talking about

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.760
and if you are questioning this, you're a vax denier

01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:51.720
and you basically should be read out of polite society.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.040
And one obvious counter example to this was social distancing.

01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.600
If social distancing was efficacious,

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.640
why were there no attempts ever to bring it back, right,

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:03.000
when you had different waves?

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.920
And if it wasn't efficacious, why was it so insistent

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.160
that we all do it at the very beginning?

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:11.880
In fact, in many places, you'll still see the signs on the floor

01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.240
where it's six feet apart.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.480
So there's an incongruity there.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:20.200
And I think we are forgetting as a people the intensity

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.440
and understandably to some extent,

01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:24.120
if you have this worldwide deadly plague,

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:27.720
like it's going to go where the leakiest hole is.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.200
So you really got to kind of get everyone on board.

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:33.320
But to the vehemence with which we're told,

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.280
we know what we're doing.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.320
This is the way to solve it.

01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.040
If you don't do it, you are causing mass death.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:44.280
That I think fed in very heavily to people's enormous sense

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.840
of skepticism toward establishment sources.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:49.240
Speaking of the plague, you opened the book.

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.320
Yeah, that quote from Camus.

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:53.000
It's a strong, strong quote.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.360
Camus brings me to tears.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.760
And it's funny because I reread the myth of Sisyphus,

01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.120
which I'd been recommending to people.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.480
Like this book is not good, but he's got his ethos

01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:03.240
is my favorite of all the philosophers.

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.720
It sounds like the myth of Sisyphus was a myth.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:08.760
He says,

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:09.720
Laugh track, cute.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.080
All I maintain is that on this earth,

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:15.000
there are plagues and there are victims.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:18.120
And it's up to us so far as possible

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.960
not to join forces with the plagues.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.800
And why I have that as the introductory quote to the book

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:29.960
is I think morality and ethics are very, very complicated subjects.

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.240
There's lots of gray areas where you don't know which way to choose.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.320
But at a base level, he has another quote that's ascribed to him.

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.560
He never actually said, but something about,

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.800
is the duty of thinking people not to be on the side of the executioners.

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.640
We should do whatever we can not to have blood on our hands.

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:53.880
Not to be murderers, not to want death.

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.320
And that in and of itself is a big pill for a lot of people to swallow.

01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.840
We're all brought up taught that war is a last resort.

01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.400
And yet when it comes to international affairs,

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.800
it's always often a first priority.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:13.800
And people are champing at the bit to start going in and killing people.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.120
And what war means isn't good guy soldiers versus bad guy soldiers.

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.760
My concern is always with the civilians, with the kids who become orphans,

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.880
with the wives who become widows and things like that.

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:28.760
And then communities which are ruined forever.

01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.120
I love that quote of his.

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.200
The book started, it was going to be a recontextualization of Camus' thought.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.760
I was going to rip off my old buddy Ryan Holiday,

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.080
what he did with the Stoics and do about Camus.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.440
And then when I started rereading Camus, I'm like, oh, I've read more into him

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.120
than is really there.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.640
And then it went into a whole other direction.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.920
So you wanted to do almost like an existentialist manifesto.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.200
So like one must imagine Sisyphus happy.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:03.960
Well, more like Camus for today and what his philosophy can teach us.

01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:06.680
Like Ryan did with his many books about the Stoics.

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:10.680
And it was going to be called The Point of Tears.

01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.720
Live to the Point of Tears?

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.240
Yes, but the title is going to be The Point of Tears.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.920
No, I know, but they're from that line.

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.120
That's a good line, right?

01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.960
He has so many good lines.

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.920
Yeah, probably shitty in bed though, right?

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.840
Well, no, he was a big lethario.

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.080
He got around.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:36.200
What percent of the audience of humans on Earth do you think know the word lethario?

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.080
What percent of them have a computer looking up?

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:41.000
Lethario.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.120
It's not some weird term.

01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:42.840
Lethario.

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.680
L-O-T-H-A-R-I-O, lethario.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.720
Lethario.

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:50.520
A man who behaves selfishly in a response to being in sexual relationships with women.

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.840
They're seduced by handsome, in quotes.

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:56.920
They're seduced by handsome lethario who gains control of their financial affairs.

01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:00.040
Oh, I didn't think, I always thought of his more as just someone who's like a stud.

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.640
Like a player, but no.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.200
Yeah, player, yeah.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:04.280
There's a malevolent aspect to it.

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:05.080
Oh, I didn't realize that.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:05.800
Okay, well then he's-

01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:06.520
Selfishly.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.480
Okay, that's not him.

01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:08.920
Irresponsibly.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:09.880
And a man too.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:14.440
Although Ayn Rand would be proud, selfishly.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:15.960
What's wrong with selfishness?

01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.720
She wouldn't like that kind of selfishness.

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:18.360
That's exploitative.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:19.320
Behaves.

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:24.600
A man who behaves selfishly and irresponsibly in his sexual relationships with women.

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:26.220
Huh.

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.640
Yeah, okay.

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.080
So he was just a player.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.080
No, maybe a stud.

01:44:31.080 --> 01:44:32.760
I don't think he was promiscuous particularly.

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:36.120
Nietzsche didn't get, he got, he never got laid, right?

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:37.560
He had syphilis, he died of syphilis.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:39.160
Oh, it was from prostitutes.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:39.880
Was it? Okay.

01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:40.440
Possibly, yeah.

01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.280
I don't know, you're asking me like I knew the guy.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:48.200
I heard it's from, he never had a deep, loving, fulfilling relationship.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:52.520
He had a very skewed understanding on the way he wrote about women.

01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:56.840
Although somebody wrote to me and said that's a mischaracterization.

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:58.520
That he was actually a very respectful woman.

01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:01.160
Yeah, but he had that line, if you're going before women, bring a whip.

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.200
Wasn't that him or was that Schopenhauer?

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:08.520
If I were to quote you from your Twitter, I think I could make a very convincing argument

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:11.240
that you're sexist, racist, and probably a Nazi.

01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.240
Well, I do own like some of Hitler's stuff.

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:15.800
Exactly.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.400
I rest my case.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.560
I feel like I'm in Nuremberg.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:25.320
I'm going to be hung by his own tie.

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.720
This isn't a tie, it's a noose.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.680
You should have thought about that when you were saying all those things.

01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:36.360
Okay, what do you think of the leak of the Twitter files?

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:49.080
I was so happy that Elon gave the information to Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss,

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:56.360
who are both by any metric lefties, who are both professional journalists of long standing

01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:57.800
with great resumes.

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.680
And overnight now they're doing PR for the world, which is where the party line was.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.240
The fact that you had all these corporate journalists now having to play catch-up

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:13.160
and not having control of the microphone, to me, was just absolutely amazing.

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:20.280
I think transparency is what brought down in many aspects of the Soviet Union

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:24.600
and what will bring down what negative aspects of the regime we have here.

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:32.120
When you see the machinations behind the scenes and then when you see the rationality of the

01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:37.560
rationalizations after the fact, you realize, oh, these people are not acting in good faith.

01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:44.040
The fact that, for example, the New York Post article about the Hunter Biden laptop

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.560
and how the New York Times covered it as well, they didn't mention any kind of dick pics,

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:53.640
Twitter made it so I couldn't even DM you the link to the New York Post article,

01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:59.160
which was a tool they had previously used only to prevent child pornography.

01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:05.800
So that shows to what extent they were willing to put their thumb on the scale.

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:13.080
But it also shows that for any layman, when they're looking at this, to realize

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:20.760
what you are perceiving as news or information is very much sculpted,

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:28.040
edited, and guided by powerful people who have a vested interest in maintaining their power.

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.960
I think, to me, the important lesson is this is not a left the right thing.

01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:34.760
Oh, not at all. It's a power versus powerless, yes.

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.520
And also the important lesson there, I think, at least in the case of Twitter,

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:43.960
in our society, it's a slippery slope. You don't get there overnight.

01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.360
You start using those tools a little bit, a little bit, to slow down this information,

01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:57.000
just a little bit. You start sending emails to each other a little bit and it becomes more and more

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.840
uncomfortable. You start forming justifications. You're still getting a little more and more

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:08.600
comfortable kind of talking about this stuff. I think there are several ways to fight that.

01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:14.200
One is having hardcore integrity up front. So don't even open the door. But I think realistically,

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:21.960
human nature is what it is. And so I think the only way is through transparency. I hate the fact

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:27.720
they got politicized. I really hate that the right have run with it. Like, look, the left is

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.760
planning the rig elections and so on. To me, it shouldn't be left or right. It shouldn't be about

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:37.480
politics. That transparency is good. Other companies should do the same. Facebook should

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:43.080
do the same. And in fact, that transparency will protect Facebook. It will protect Google.

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.200
Look, this is our situation. Tell us what to do and we'll do our best.

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.040
I remember when I was writing the New Right, Twitter's line was,

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.520
we're not going to tell you guys what the metrics are by which we ban or censor people

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:04.520
because then bad actors are going to navigate around them. And it's like, what are you doing?

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:10.680
Just tell people in any establishment what are the rules for which behavior is permissible.

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:16.440
If I go to a store, if I return the sweater, is it cash back, no refunds, or if I get store credit?

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:23.960
So that they were having this place which was presented as a huge international space

01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.520
for public discourse and they're not telling you ahead of time, this is what we will tolerate,

01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:33.320
this is what we will warn you about, this is what will kick you out overnight. That to me was crazy

01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:43.480
and outrageous. And I'm really pleased with to what extent Elon is being open with their policies.

01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:50.840
And what I really want to commend him about is, now I'm triggered, because one of the things that

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:56.280
he took over, he's like, our first priority is getting rid of child pornography and child

01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:02.680
exploitation. That was, he's like, racial slurs, homophobic slurs, anti-semitic slurs, yeah, yeah,

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:09.320
that's cool. Kids getting harmed is number one. And he fired the old task force because they

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:14.600
weren't doing their job. Eliza Blue, who you know, she had been on this for a long time,

01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:18.840
but people who were victims of child pornography, child exploitation were emailing Twitter,

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.440
being like, these are my images, get them off. And they're like, too bad, porn is allowed on

01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:28.360
Twitter. He starts trying to crack down on it. This is a very hard problem because these bad

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:34.520
actors have mechanisms to evade being banned. They want to get their, for lack of a better

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:41.800
term, product out there. Forbes magazine, who is an agent of the devil, had a tweet and they

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:47.400
tweeted this nine times. You know, now that Elon's here, Twitter's child porn nightmare

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:53.240
has gotten much worse. They tweet this nine times. I looked up, anyone listening can look up, look

01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:58.200
at Forbes and do a search. They never mentioned this problem before. So now that Elon is doing

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:02.280
something about it, now it's a problem for you. No, it's a problem. Elon's the problem. It's not

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:07.640
the child porn that you guys had a problem with. And that to me is like, yeah, I understand that

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:14.200
you think that Elon is a bad guy because he's upset your apple cart. This isn't a political issue.

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:20.840
This isn't a gotcha moment. This is, all right, here are some tips. We talked to 10 experts,

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:27.400
digital experts, and here are some techniques, Mr. Musk, that you might want to take from us,

01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:30.600
free of charge, that will help you solve this. That would be a great article.

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.520
And I just want to use this opportunity to say quite clearly and strongly that even though

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:41.000
Twitter and other parts of the internet are interpreting some of my statements to mean I'm

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:47.720
right in this case, meaning leaning right, right wing. And in other cases, leaning left, left wing,

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:53.720
I'm not. I'm apolitical or at least I try to be in my thinking. Take one issue at a time. I do take

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:59.320
an opinion on each issue at a time, but I hate camps. I try to avoid political camps in general.

01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:06.680
It just, it sucks that promoting transparency in this case or celebrating transparency

01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:17.160
is somehow connected to being right wing. No, it's being made into supposed euphemism

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:24.760
for being right wing. It just, it sucks. It sucks even though I'm wearing a red suit and this is a

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:29.880
very red themed conversation. Well, that's, I mean, the revolution was the color of blood.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:41.320
I'm just gonna let it sit on that for a second. Okay. You mentioned New York Times bestseller list.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:45.960
You chose to self publish. Yes. Can we just linger on that decision? What's,

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:52.920
what are the pros and cons of self publishing? The cons are it is acceptable in our current

01:52:53.560 --> 01:53:00.120
business climate or cultural climate for corporate media outlets to pretend the book doesn't exist.

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:05.480
Yep. So basically, and there's reason for it. I can make the case to them pretty easily.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.400
If someone's doing it themselves, who is this guy's some crackpot writing crazy stuff from his

01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:16.040
basement, right? It's a little different, I think, for me, because I'm an established author. C-SPAN

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:20.600
gave me an hour on book TV. Still a crackpot, but yeah, established. For Dear Reader, I think I was

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:25.960
the first one to get an hour on book TV for a book that I did myself. So there is space for that.

01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:33.160
It didn't go through a vetting process the way a book going through a corporate publisher did.

01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:41.240
So those are the minuses. The pros are I can drop it and publish it immediately.

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:45.080
If you go through a corporate publisher, you have to wait a year.

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:51.320
Um, you can do what you could have the book you want instead of getting past the editor.

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:55.240
And some editors are very, very good. And there's a whole spectrum. Some of them not so good.

01:53:55.240 --> 01:54:01.720
Some are good. I know the best and the real killers. All right. There's good people on both

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:05.160
sides. Yeah. There's plenty of people on both sides. And I don't mean the white nationalists

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:12.120
who I condemn totally. Um, so, but the thing is in terms of money, you get six times as much

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:16.280
a profit when you self-publish. Then you, when you go through a corporate publisher,

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.480
the buck stops here. It's, you know, in one of my books that I co-authored, I won't even mention the

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:27.320
name. There is a typo and they didn't, they don't care. They didn't fix it for the paperback edition

01:54:27.320 --> 01:54:32.600
here. Since I'm going through Amazon, if there's a typo, I can fix it live and it updates. Yeah.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:37.400
You can just update it. Yeah. So that's very useful. Like a fight club thing where you can

01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:42.680
insert like a dick pic in one of the pages. Okay. Why are you so, why do you keep texting

01:54:42.680 --> 01:54:47.960
me to send you dick pics? Talk about North Pole. All right. All right. All right. I get it. I'm

01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:55.800
not the editor. I get it. North Pole. I get it. Yeah. Um, the other advantage just socially is

01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:00.360
I think people are like, I found this with the Kickstarter I did for Dear Reader. People are

01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:06.600
much more excited to buy it and promote it and talk about it when they know you're doing it yourself

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:11.480
instead of you're getting a big check from, you know, St. Martin's Harper Collins, Penguin,

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:15.880
whatever. Are you also trying to use some kind of service to get it distributed to bookstores

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:20.440
or are you just going to do Amazon? No, just Amazon. Yeah. And that's probably where most

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:24.760
sales happen. The vast majority. Yeah. So it's not going to be in bookstores. So what's, how

01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:30.040
difficult is the process of getting it on Amazon? So I'll tell you a funny story about how Amazon

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:38.920
works. And cause this was a, I always planned for, because everyone, people's, here's another piece

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:42.600
of advice I will give people. Your life will be a lot easier if you realize that the majority of

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:46.600
people in every industry are bad at their jobs. Like once you have that realization, everything

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.080
else makes sense and you, your life will be a lot easier. Right? So when I did the Anarchist Handbook,

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:54.520
which was a collection of essays from various anarchists throughout history,

01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:00.760
when I submitted it to Amazon, there was a lot of copyright issues because they're like,

01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:03.720
do you have the rights to this essay? Do you have the rights to this essay? I had to go back and

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:09.320
forth with them a lot to make sure I had copyright where everything was public domain. And that,

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.000
and the thing is you forward it, you know, you update it, you give them the information,

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.920
three days, there's another problem, it's not three days, so it's weeks. The other thing with

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:26.040
their CreateSpace program is the paperback and the ebook, the Kindle, are approved independently.

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:30.920
So just because it's approved for one, it's not approved for the other. After I published

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.480
Anarchist Handbook, and it was a big success, they unleashed, unrolled, excuse me, a hardcover

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:43.560
edition program. So I'm like, oh great, I'll put in hardcover. They're like, sorry, this is too

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:48.600
similar to Murray Rothbard's Anatomy of the State, which is a pamphlet or short book that

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:53.960
Murray Rothbard wrote. I go, well wait, I have the entirety of Anatomy of the State in here,

01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:58.680
I have permission from the Mises Institute in writing, which I'm giving to you to reprint it,

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.960
and you guys already have it been published for a year as a paperback and ebook, and they're like,

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:10.920
too bad, blocked. So it's not available as a hardcover on Amazon, even though it's available,

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.880
maybe now it's going to be pulled as paperback and ebook. So with this book, I was anticipating,

01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:21.160
all right, there's going to be some whatever. The thing with how it works is you have to upload it

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:25.480
and hit publish, and then you got to wait for the approval. I'm like, okay, this is going to be,

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.920
who knows? I just wanted to get it as fast as possible. 4 a.m., in less than 24 hours,

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:34.920
I get a notification, congratulations, your book's available for sale, and I have to run

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:40.280
downstairs and pull it from publication because otherwise it was out and I didn't finish editing

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:48.520
it. So that's the situation there. Oh, that's fascinating. But that's powerful. It's all in

01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:54.840
your hands. It's all on you. Yes, and I think the program is great. It charts just like any other

01:57:54.840 --> 01:58:04.840
book. The quality of the books is great. I am very happy. I have no contact with them. My buddy,

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.840
Tucker Maxx, he had a company that did this, and they basically helped people self-publish their

01:58:08.840 --> 01:58:12.520
own book. They did Dave Goggins' book. I think you've talked to him, haven't you? Yeah, maybe

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:19.080
they emailed me or something. Yeah, and he said, I have done dozens, maybe hundreds of books with

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.160
them. I have never been able to get someone on the phone. So I don't know what's going on over there,

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:29.160
but guys, if you want to reach out to me, please call me. It's michael at lexfreedman.com.

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:36.840
Friedman is spelled wrong. Yeah. If you ever have any complaints,

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:47.880
please just at me at Twitter about Michael. No. Why do you think so few established authors

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:56.600
self-publish? I mean, it seems like it makes perfect sense in this modern society to be able to,

01:58:56.600 --> 01:59:02.440
when you finish the book, to publish it within a few days, a few weeks. I think I talked to

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:06.680
Jordan Peterson about this at length and Michaela, his daughter, who I'm also good friends with.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:10.120
She's actually named after Gorbachev, who's the big hero of this book. Also a friend?

01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:17.800
You know, I was in talks to interview Gorbachev and then COVID hit, and that's one of the big

01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:25.080
regrets of my life. I think if I met him, I would be on my knees, literally kissing his feet, crying

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:31.320
because of, I mean, one of the big points of The White Pill is there were so many moments

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:37.560
when they were calling him up, sending the tanks, we want another Tiananmen Square,

01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:44.200
and he's like, fuck you. So when you have anyone who has the capacity to murder

01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:50.600
thousands of people and chooses to withhold that power, like all I could do is applaud.

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:52.280
He resisted the cynicism.

01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:58.200
Yes. Wait, so why don't the authors publish the books? I think they're still in the,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.680
you know how there's this whole idea about if you're a movie actor, you don't go on TV

02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:06.760
because that kind of ruins your brand? And that's kind of going away. There's a lot of

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:11.000
shows where the lead is now like a former movie actor, and this is kind of a big thing.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:16.680
Like Matthew McConaughey, he had a TV show on HBO, I believe. So I think there's this kind of like,

02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:19.000
wait a minute, what's that? I knew what you said.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:27.960
I said, all right. All right, all right, all right. Matthew McConaughey, all right, all right.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:30.680
I don't know what that is. Sorry.

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.160
I'll explain it. Look at the context below.

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:42.040
Okay. So I think for them, it might be A, a loss of credibility to some extent, but B,

02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:49.480
their agent whose job is to sell them and get a big advance wouldn't be encouraged to self-publish

02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:53.960
because they're, you know, so I don't think it's percolated to powerful people yet how feasible

02:00:53.960 --> 02:01:02.360
this is and how profitable it is and how they'll still be able to reach their audience. And I feel

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:09.240
if, you know, I don't, if Anarchist Handbook wasn't such a gigantic success, I would be

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:14.120
more nervous about The White Pill, but the fact that it was and that I saw it from start to finish

02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:17.800
and I know the ins and outs, now I'm like, what are you guys bringing to the table? It's taking

02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:21.480
a year of my time and introducing edits that I would not otherwise agree with.

02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:29.080
I think for some people, a book is a sort of beacon of reputation. So it's really important to not,

02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:35.320
there's somehow not as much reputation associated with a self-published book unless it's successful.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:39.080
Yes. And then like the, its success

02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:45.320
outshines the actual, however it was published. I think, I guess David Goggins self-published

02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:49.400
his book. Because it used to be you self-published when you can't get a book deal,

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:55.560
so it's like an admission of failure. Yeah, so you would recommend it as something for authors?

02:01:55.560 --> 02:02:01.080
No, I would recommend it as something for authors of a certain stature, for lack of a better term,

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:07.400
because it is still in terms of your resume and your experience, it's better to get a crappy

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:14.680
advance and have a book with St. Martin's that goes nowhere than a self-published book that

02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:19.400
goes nowhere. So the other thing is you have to make sure you have enough an audience that

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:25.960
you can move some copies. What about OnlyFans? Would you recommend authors? How much money do

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.760
you think you and I can make if we did like bathtub scenes in OnlyFans? No, just chilling,

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.760
just reading, like reading like Animal Farm, just like while sitting in the bathtub.

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:41.880
I don't know. Okay, Snowflake. Snowball, sorry, Snowball. Okay, Snowball.

02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:50.200
All right. What was his name? Snowball. No, the horse. Boxer. I'm hung like a boxer.

02:02:52.360 --> 02:03:00.600
I will work harder. And that guy, I think about that guy a lot. Boxer? Yeah, his model was I will

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:06.200
work harder, anything that happens. So like the pigs would take advantage and his response to

02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:12.600
everything. He was inspiring to me because he never gave in to the cynicism. Right, and they killed

02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:19.800
him. Yeah. Spoiler, sorry. But that's a good way to die, never giving in. Well, yeah, there's a

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:24.280
lot of that in this book about the people who were like, I'm not, you're not going to break me. Like,

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:33.880
I am bigger than this. Did you ever believe in Santa? I remember the day I woke up on New

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:37.640
Year's and there was a present under my pillow and it was like, holy shit.

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:44.280
Because Diede Moroz left it. That's the whole thing. He leaves your present under your pillow.

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:48.600
Right. So you believed, but I thought the story was going to be when you first realized he's not

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:53.560
real. I don't remember when I realized he wasn't real, but that story was, I did think it was real.

02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:59.560
I was like, oh my God. And okay. There's this, cause I did too. And I remember,

02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:05.640
I don't think I can put myself in the mindset of the kind of person that believed he was real.

02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:13.000
Cause what did I think? What was my worldview that allowed like a giant person in a red suit to be

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:19.000
real? Although I do remember, I think the first time a Santa Claus showed up to our, like lived

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.560
in this very small apartment. And when he first showed up to our apartment, I just remember it.

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:30.600
Cause he was really drunk and smelled. It was like a party. It was like a New Year's party or

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:35.640
whatever. So one of the, one of the people dressed up with Santa Claus, I just remember this.

02:04:36.920 --> 02:04:44.760
Wow. This, this gotten like real fast. I remember like thinking, of course, of course it would be

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:49.400
like, what was I thinking? What was I thinking? There's going to be some perfect,

02:04:50.680 --> 02:04:56.760
like perfect being like better than like the best of humanity. He was just a regular dude,

02:04:58.040 --> 02:05:04.600
kind of fat, but like not sexy fat. It was like, not really that jolly and kind of exhausted.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:08.120
I really have not showered in a while, but also funny.

02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:15.320
I remember, I love telling the story how old I was and I must've been five or six.

02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:19.320
And it was just that age where you distinguish between what's real and what's not.

02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:30.040
So like Vikings and Knights and ninjas are real and dragons and mermaids and elves are fake.

02:05:30.040 --> 02:05:34.680
And I was on the corner of Shore Parkway right before the park in Bensonhurst in Brooklyn

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:43.000
and around the corner wearing a denim vest was a little person, a dwarf. And I saw him

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.440
and I was like, all right, back to the drawing board. Like, I don't know what's real or not

02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:49.800
anymore because I just saw a dwarf. So I don't know what's going on.

02:05:49.800 --> 02:05:53.240
And since then, given your relationship with Alex Jones,

02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:55.880
you've continued the journey of not knowing what's real or not.

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:56.520
That's correct.

02:05:57.320 --> 02:06:01.880
All right. Let's talk about the next steps after Stalin took power. He started to actually

02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:07.160
implementing some of the economic, some of the policies and this idea of collectivization.

02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:14.920
What's the story of that in the 20s leading into the 30s? What was this idea? What was

02:06:14.920 --> 02:06:18.600
the relationship between the regime, the ideology and the farmers?

02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:23.480
Well, there's always been, and obviously very much this day, an enormous amount of

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:30.120
enmity, for lack of a better term, hatred between Ukraine and Russia. I mean, this is

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:38.600
you know, centuries in the making, if not more. And the Ukraine, or Ukraine now, but at the time,

02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:44.040
I'm speaking of the region, is and still is the breadbasket of Europe. It was very fertile lands.

02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:50.760
This is where the food comes from. And this was an issue also for Lenin, as I discuss in the book,

02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:55.960
because when you had famines there, you know, you have famines throughout what later became

02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:01.160
the Soviet Union. And the problem is, this happened in North Korea as well in the 90s,

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:06.200
when they don't have food, if you let in foreigners and feed your people, all of a sudden,

02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:12.280
you as the government are either superfluous or downright, you know, deleterious to their well-being,

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:18.200
and that's a threat to your power. So Lenin let in an American organization in the early 20s,

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:22.840
which was actually headed by Herbert Hoover of all people. And after a while, Hoover left,

02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:26.600
because he found that the Bolsheviks were just taking the grain that the Americans were giving

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:31.480
to feed the people and selling it for export while the people suffered. And one of the people who

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:37.240
grew up in these starvation times was a young Mikhail Gorbachev, where he had, you know,

02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:41.240
I think it was like a quarter or a third of his village starved to death during one of these

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:51.240
periodic famines. Stalin's idea, this was a good mechanism for him to break the idea of Ukraine

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:57.560
being an independent nation within its own identity. And, you know, he had this kind of

02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:02.440
liquidation of the kulaks, you know, very famously, which thankfully is much more discussed now

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:10.600
than it was maybe when you and I were kids. And a kulak, the real meaning or the literal meaning

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:16.200
is kind of this wealthy landowner, right? But very quickly, it's kind of like it becomes outgroup.

02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:23.480
So, you know, there was a big incentive to call someone you didn't like a kulak and then good

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:27.240
luck to you because now the eyes of the state are on you and you have to prove that, you know,

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:32.120
you didn't hire people, you didn't have four cows or how many acres or so and so forth.

02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:38.120
They took a huge percentage of the population, the kulaks, and they just deported them. You know,

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.160
these are lands that they had for generations and they just spread them throughout

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:48.440
the broader Russia. Many of them never made it and many of them were killed. This was by design.

02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:54.520
And the dark thing about the kulaks, like you said, when it becomes abused, when it becomes the

02:08:54.520 --> 02:09:05.480
outgroup, is the kulak is supposed to be wealthier than sort of the general farmer-peasant. And so,

02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:09.000
basically, it gives you a mechanism of resentment. Anybody that's better off

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.080
must be better off because they're kulaks, let's get rid of them. And it has a,

02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:19.800
just from an economics perspective, even leaving ethics aside, it basically completely

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:27.320
de-incentivizes productivity. It wants you to fail because if you succeed, you're a kulak and

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.560
you're going to be tortured, you're going to be deported, you're going to be derided, all that.

02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:38.120
And also, you're poor because he's rich. Like, that's a big part of it. So, while this was going

02:09:38.120 --> 02:09:42.920
on and food was becoming a problem because you had, you know, for weather conditions,

02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:48.680
there was a campaign about, oh, the reason you're hungry is because the kulaks are hoarding all

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:54.280
their grain. And if you're somewhere else in the Soviet Union, how are you supposed to know any

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:58.840
better? Because you're being told every year the crops are bumper crop, bumper crop, bumper crop,

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:04.280
and now there's no food, there's no bread. And so, see, we produced all this bread. It's not

02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:10.440
getting to you because the kulaks are hoarding the grain. So, they came like, in what became

02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:17.000
known as the Haldimor, and Ann Applebaum, who's a great historian who, unfortunately, I disagree

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.280
with a lot in contemporary politics, but who's done so much great work about the Soviet Union

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:26.520
that I pretty much give her a blank cheque and whatever she wants to say nowadays. You know,

02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:32.120
she wrote a great book about this called Red Famine. And these activists descended on these

02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.720
villages like locusts. And their job was to requisition as much food as possible.

02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:43.160
And they would come back, you know, at all hours of the night to make sure you weren't hiding food.

02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:49.720
And this is what was so pernicious about it. Your own body would betray you. They could look at you

02:10:49.720 --> 02:10:54.520
and see that you're not losing weight. You've got those chubby cheeks. That means you have food.

02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:59.240
And that's the government's food. That is the food of the people. And if you are keeping food

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.840
for yourself, you are stealing from the people. You're an enemy of the people,

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:06.840
and you deserve whatever comes to you. And it got to a point where they're eating,

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:15.160
they didn't have grain to plant for the next harvest. And what was even sicker is, you know,

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:21.160
one of the big criticisms of communists, of the Tsar, was his internal passport system,

02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.880
that I can't go wherever I want within Russia, the Russian Empire, without permission.

02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:33.160
Stalin reintroduced this. So if your village was targeted, you can't leave. Now, some people

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:37.240
got away. They tried to get to the cities and so on and so forth. But you get to the city

02:11:37.880 --> 02:11:43.480
and you're starving. You have no clothes. You're a kulak. I'm hungry because of you. And now you're

02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:49.080
too lazy to work. Get the F out of there. And there were stories, you know, I have them in

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:54.440
the white pill of this like starving teenage girl, and she's begging for food. And the guy

02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:59.560
the shopkeep knocks the food out of her hand, and she dies on the spot. And everyone in that line knew

02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:05.800
not to give her any food or any sympathy because she's a kulak sympathizer. And very quickly,

02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:09.320
if you're a kulak sympathizer, all that has to happen is someone has to call,

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:13.880
I think it was the NKVD at the time, you know, the different names, the Cheka, the secret police,

02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:19.480
and they have to be like, oh, you see whatever her name was, Zhenya, she was a kulak sympathizer.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.160
We saw a kulak who was trying to shake us down for food because too lazy to work, and she

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:27.000
felt so bad for them. So you might want to check in on Zhenya. So yeah.

02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.680
But in 32 and 33, Holodomor, it wasn't just

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.200
small injustice here and there. It was mass starvation.

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:40.680
Yes.

02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.800
And suffering.

02:12:41.800 --> 02:12:46.120
Yes. Millions starved to death in the Ukraine alone and by design.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:51.160
So you mentioned Anne Appelbaum's book, Red Famine, Stalin's War in Ukraine, but another

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.160
excellent book on the topic. And by the way, thank you for recommending that to me. So it was-

02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.160
Her work's amazing.

02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:04.120
Yeah. It's a really, really powerful book about not just about Holodomor, but like the context of

02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:09.480
Ukraine, basically the history of Ukraine that's relevant for today.

02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:09.960
Yeah.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:17.560
To understand, understand the relationship between Russia and Ukraine. But another great book is

02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:21.720
Bloodlands, Europe Between Hitler and Stalin by Timothy Snyder. I don't know. I think you also

02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.480
recommended that to me at some point, or maybe not.

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:25.960
I haven't, but I'm familiar with that. I haven't read it.

02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:33.080
So he does quite a bit of, it's brief, but extremely well-researched writing about cannibalism

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:38.280
there. And that it was not uncommon during the Stalin and post-Soviet era, but it was

02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:43.800
uncommon during the Stalin and post-Soviet Ukraine for parents to cook and eat their children.

02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.920
He writes, quote, survival was a moral as well as a physical struggle. A woman doctor wrote

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:55.320
to a friend in June, 1933, that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was not sure that

02:13:55.320 --> 02:14:01.480
it shall not be won by the time my letter reaches you, end quotes. The good people died first.

02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:06.520
Those who refused to steal or to prostitute themselves died. Those who gave food to others

02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:12.520
died. Those who refused to eat corpses died. Those who refused to kill their fellow man died.

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.240
Parents who resisted cannibalism died before their children did. And there are stories in there

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:27.720
about, yeah, cooking, cooking your children. The other thing about cannibalism, about

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:35.080
famine in general, that stood out to me, unlike a lot of atrocities, is the people that are starving

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:42.120
are exhausted. They're basically unable to think, so they don't even have the energy to protest.

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:52.760
It's a strange kind of way to kill thinking in the populace. I suppose it was obvious,

02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:59.560
but there's something fundamental about starvation where it slowly removes your humanity.

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:05.800
Yeah, there was a scene in the book where a lot of times people literally go crazy,

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:12.200
and there's a scene where a mom at some train station was nursing her kid, and she was going

02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:16.440
mad from hunger, and she starts beating the crap out of her baby and kicking it, and then she just

02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:23.000
reverts to normal like nothing had happened. Yeah, madness. You lose your mind.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.800
Yeah, and I mean, I don't know what the physiological cause of that is, but it's

02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:35.320
I think if someone has dealt with glycogen depletion, it affects their mood, things like

02:15:35.320 --> 02:15:39.880
that, so taken to an extreme, who knows what happens when parts of the brain start functioning

02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:47.720
and start imploding. But yeah, what just happened, this is something that's really cool regarding

02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:56.760
the Holodomor. So there was one Western journalist, Gareth Jones, who was like, all right,

02:15:56.760 --> 02:16:02.440
something's not adding up here. So he was supposed to take a train through Ukraine,

02:16:03.080 --> 02:16:09.800
and he got out early and decided to start walking through the countryside to go from village to

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:17.320
village. And I'll get to his story in a minute. Right before we started recording, I got this

02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:23.480
book in the mail. I ordered it on November 28th from Great Britain. It was the only copy available

02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:31.320
on the whole internet. It's called Experiences in Russia 1931. It is anonymous, and Gareth Jones

02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.400
wrote the introduction. It was published by the Alton Press in Pittsburgh. It was self-published,

02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:45.480
and it just says forward, it just says by the author. So the author who went alongside

02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:57.080
Gareth Jones was someone by the name of Henry John Hines, who was heir to the Hines fortune.

02:16:58.040 --> 02:17:01.960
And you only know that if you start looking on the internet because his name's not anywhere

02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:06.360
in this book. Well, I opened this book up right when I got it, right before we were taping,

02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:12.280
and it's signed by him. And it took me a second. I'm like, wait a minute, who is this signed by?

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:15.560
And it's H.J. Hines, because his name was Jack Hines, but it was Henry John Hines.

02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:19.960
I'm very excited that I had this little miracle in the mail.

02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:22.200
Christmas miracle.

02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.240
It's a Christmas miracle.

02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:25.160
They travel together?

02:17:25.160 --> 02:17:27.880
They travel together. So this book's a diary of their travels.

02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:32.040
Why do you think so few journalists was able to do what he did?

02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:37.960
There were several reasons. First of all, if you were a Western journalist in the Soviet Union,

02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:44.360
you were under very strict circumstances. First of all, you could be deported at any time.

02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:51.880
There was no pretense that you have a right to be a journalist, especially as a representative

02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.400
of a capitalist by which they meant Western paper. Second, it was a complete nightmare

02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:01.880
getting your articles filed because you had a censor that you had to go through. And the

02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:06.840
censor's job, whose life depended on it, was to make sure that your story was advantageous

02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:12.200
to the Soviet Union, or at least neutral. They had all sorts of techniques. They spied on you

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:17.240
all the time. They followed you around because you're a foreigner. But also, that censor had to

02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:23.480
answer somebody. So all the censor has to do is be like, look, I'm having trouble with my supervisor,

02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:26.360
and the reporter could be like, well, can I talk to the supervisor? It's like, well, I'm sorry,

02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:31.160
that's not possible. And he's on deadline, but it's too bad. Bureaucracy doesn't recognize

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:40.200
the needs of deadlines. So there was a lot of pressure on Western journalists to have to

02:18:40.200 --> 02:18:44.760
get through this net, and that's literally constant. Every story is going to be a fight.

02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:48.120
So at a certain point, you're just going to be like, all right, and you're going to pre-censor

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:52.920
yourself. If you know, all right, if I include this, it's not going to get through, what are

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:58.200
you supposed to do? I think human beings are naturally, and also a lot of these journalists

02:18:58.200 --> 02:19:05.240
were pro-Soviet. They thought this is the society, the future. At least everyone's trying

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:11.400
to make it a better country for everyone, not like back home with a poor slip between the cracks.

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:21.960
We got to do what we can to make this work. And there was a lot of, I don't want to say conspiracy,

02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:29.240
but within the industry, there was a consensus that Stalin was the good guy, and we were,

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:35.640
if not the bad guys, certainly not as good in certain regards. So when this news of the famine

02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:40.760
started percolating, all the other Western journalists besides Gareth Jones and Malcolm

02:19:40.760 --> 02:19:46.280
Muggeridge were saying this isn't true. It's nothing that they haven't seen before. The

02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:50.040
paper that took the lead in this was New York Times with their guy, Walter Durante,

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:54.120
who had previously won a Pulitzer and had interviewed Stalin, which was an enormously

02:19:54.120 --> 02:20:02.600
rare honor for a Westerner. Because he has so much experience covering Russia and the Soviet Union,

02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:06.760
he basically took the lead and other people followed his lead. He was kind of the dean

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:17.160
of the press corps in Russia. There's so many quotes I have from him where he's not only denying

02:20:17.160 --> 02:20:21.400
that this mass starvation is happening, he's also going after journalists who are questioning the

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:27.560
narrative. And he says things like, look, this is nothing that the Russians haven't experienced

02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:32.840
before. They're simply tightening their belts. And it's like, you only have to tighten your belt

02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:37.160
when you don't have enough food. It's not like they started a new exercise regimen and now their

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:43.640
body fat's dropping. Why would someone tighten their belt? So that was one. And the New York

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:50.840
Times had a 13-page article, big headline, Russians Hungry, Not Starving. And he went

02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:56.600
after Jones. He went after McGregor, I believe. No, he did go after McGregor. But the point being

02:20:56.600 --> 02:21:02.520
that this is just propaganda from people who want the Soviet Union to fail. They don't understand

02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:09.160
what they're building here. He had so many excuses. He's like, oh, the reason all these

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:14.200
Russians are supposedly leaving their villages to go to the cities isn't because there's no food.

02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:18.440
It's because they're nomadic. It's tradition. They go from town to town looking for new

02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:24.440
experiences. And it's just, at a certain point, and I think it was 1941, where he was eventually

02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:31.000
like, or 51 rather, I don't remember, he was like, oh, well, I guess I was kind of wrong.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:35.160
And he's like, any journalist worth his salt can admit when he's wrong. And it's like, well,

02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:43.560
were you worth your salt? Because he explicitly said, there's no point in sending out journalists

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:47.240
to look for themselves. I've been through the countryside and everyone's fine. And it's just

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:53.800
that the loudest people are making noise, whereas everyone else is doing the work. And this isn't

02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:58.440
about famine, but it's about Westerns skeptical about collectivization, which is just simply a

02:21:58.440 --> 02:22:03.000
new way of farming. And yeah, it was a new way of farming. And the results were by design.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.880
And also, accidentally, absolutely catastrophic.

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:14.360
How hard was it to see the truth at that time, do you think? Do you think that was a mistake

02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:21.960
that's understandable to make as a journalist? If my job as a journalist, I have two bosses

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:28.440
if I'm in Moscow. I've got my reporter in New York or London or whatever, but I've got my sensor

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:35.960
here. And he is making sure I have a house, the department. He makes sure I have food.

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:42.200
He makes sure I have access to dignitaries. He's my lifeline. If I piss him off, I'm on the next

02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:53.400
plane out of town. Is that enough to slowly suffocate the integrity of a journalist?

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:57.240
I don't think it was slow at all. And it was clearly enough. And because what are they going

02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:04.040
to do? I disagree with that. I think the failure of integrity has to come from New York, on the

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:10.360
American side, that it's just the flock of fish or whatever that all move in the same narrative.

02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:18.920
I think journalists would like to be the kind of people that have integrity. So if they are

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:23.400
conscious of sacrificing their own integrity, they wouldn't do it. If they're conscious of an act

02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:28.120
that's doing it, they wouldn't do it. So it has to happen like a lobster slowly boiling.

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:33.160
No, I think it happens when everyone else is, it's a Greek chorus.

02:23:33.160 --> 02:23:37.640
Right, right. It's a chorus. But that's exactly, that's right. So it's not about the act,

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:43.720
but they will, I mean, I've talked to journalists where I get the sense that

02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:48.200
they will sell their soul for access. Because that's their job.

02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:54.280
Is it though? Because what they do, what journalists do, I've seen American journalists,

02:23:54.920 --> 02:24:01.320
they take a huge amount of pride for having gotten the interview, whatever that is, the Putin

02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:10.120
interview. And first of all, they're glowing with pride. It seems like they're always showing off

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:15.320
to the other journalists back in America. So they're showing off like, look, I got the access,

02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:20.360
you didn't. And second thing they're doing when they show up to that interview is they ask all

02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:27.000
the questions that signal to the other journalists that we're on the same side. They ask the most

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:36.760
generic, aggressive questions to which they know the answers. They want to basically get the access

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:43.080
and ask the quote unquote hard hitting questions that they know will not be answered. And this is

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:48.200
the entire machinery of it. That's modern journalism. And I suppose at that time.

02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:50.040
It was worse.

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:55.400
It was worse. They weren't even doing the display of hard hitting questions.

02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:02.760
Right. Because think about what high status that is. If I'm an American journalist in Moscow,

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:11.640
I'm allowed in this secretive country. I'm the guy who's very privileged to have access

02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:17.560
to live in Moscow and tell Americans, which are all fascinated about this new society, the future,

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:24.200
what it's like. And as soon as I kind of start questioning the narrative, I'm going to get kicked

02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.840
out and humiliated very publicly. I thought you were in Moscow. What am I supposed to say?

02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:35.800
So, you know, they, Eugene Lyons was, you know, he's one of the heroes in the book. He was a

02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:40.600
young communist and I think it was United Press. He was working for, they sent him there. And when

02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:45.240
he went there, he's like, oh, this is not what I thought it was going to be like. This is horrible.

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:51.640
And he turned very heavily against it. But he talks about how they would write one thing

02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:57.080
and say another thing and then think another thing. And each of those steps was just more and more

02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.320
like kind of lying in terms of maintaining your sanity and maintaining your narrative.

02:26:02.360 --> 02:26:09.480
So you reference Anna Applebaum and say that, quote, starvation was not simply a consequence.

02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:14.600
It was the goal and it was the law. Stalin intended to break the Ukrainians once and for all.

02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:20.440
It thus became common for villagers to spy and inform on one another. Turning in a neighbor

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:26.040
for having a sack of grain might be the easiest and safest way to procure food for one's family.

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:35.320
To what degree was this the intention? To what degree did Stalin anticipate this kind of

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:39.480
suffering as a consequence of the collectivization policy?

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:43.560
I don't know that he intended the suffering to be a consequence of the collectivization,

02:26:44.120 --> 02:26:51.160
but it was quite apparent, and I think there's a pretty heavy consensus nowadays,

02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:59.320
that his goal was very much because Ukraine, again, resented the Tsar and had this kind of

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:04.760
very contentious relationship with Russia, which obviously very clearly remains today. I mean,

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:11.160
the hatred of Ukrainians for Russians preceded Putin's war. I mean, even when I was a kid,

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:15.800
I obviously don't remember it, but my parents just told me the hatred that they had.

02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:18.440
And understandably, they were basically under foreign occupation,

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:22.440
what they regard as foreign occupation. So your parents talked about the hatred

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:24.200
by Ukrainians towards Russians? Oh, yes.

02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:34.600
I mean, having visited there this year, because of the most recent invasion in February,

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:42.680
that hatred is nationwide and very intense. But I don't know, I think the feeling,

02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:47.160
the emotions were much more complex before. But at the same time, they were under occupation

02:27:47.160 --> 02:27:51.720
before, right? And they couldn't speak Ukrainian, they had to speak Russian. So this was a thing.

02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:59.720
But because of the forced intermixing, it's a more complex story.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:03.000
Okay. I mean, they weren't certainly fans.

02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:08.920
Yeah, but there's people that came from Russia that are living there, they're marrying,

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:13.880
they're falling in love, they're working with each other. So there is the bigger atrocity of

02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:18.280
the genocide of it, but there's also the reality of intermixing of the peoples, right?

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:22.280
Well, sure. I mean- There's the atrocity of slavery in the United States,

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.880
but then there's also a reality that there's now an intermixing of the peoples. And they fall in

02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:34.680
love and they live after slavery is abolished. That's just the reality. After the genocide

02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:44.280
proceeds a kind of generational integration that still remembers, the suffering reverberates,

02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:50.120
but there's still, it's a different culture that's created. And now I think,

02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:57.960
I mean, I have complex story. I mean, most of my family is from Ukraine. So I have a,

02:28:58.680 --> 02:29:05.560
and my understanding is grounded in Soviet Ukraine. But there is something

02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:11.400
in the last 30 years that's different. Where now after the collapse of the Soviet Union,

02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:16.760
there's a true, maybe renewed fight for independence. And that's a different thing.

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.480
But there's also a difference, like if I go to North Korea as an American,

02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:29.320
right? They're very friendly now, right? They don't perceive me as part of the yank devils.

02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:33.240
They're like, okay, you're an American, but you come from America. So yeah, there's going to be

02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:39.560
intermarriage, but that's a big difference between the perception of Russia as an entity,

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:41.560
as opposed to some individual Russians.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:50.520
I just, that wasn't the experience I've had talking to a lot of friends and family in Ukraine

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.800
until the war started.

02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:55.400
Really? So they really didn't have this kind of low key animosity toward Russians?

02:29:55.400 --> 02:30:05.720
No, there was a lot of factional conflict inside Ukraine. Now the whole country is united. I think

02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:11.400
there's a clarity now. The war gave a clarity that wasn't there before.

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:14.920
No, this is, I was saying earlier how humans define themselves by opposition. So now that

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:19.320
there's a war, it's like, okay, all this little stuff doesn't matter. We are all united because

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:20.200
we have a common enemy.

02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:27.160
But there's also, as you know, there's regions and there's just groups of different people.

02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:32.360
And then one of the big divides, of course, is the city versus rural. And then in the case of

02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:38.600
Ukraine, it's Eastern Ukraine and Western Ukraine, it's very difficult to know what the truth is

02:30:38.600 --> 02:30:45.000
because my personal experience is sampled. I don't know how many Ukrainians I know, maybe like 30 or

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:51.560
40, before this trip, like 30 or 40. And then I'm close with just a handful. But then it's hard to

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:55.560
know because you get a lot of Western press perspective and you get the Russian perspective

02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:59.160
and you get other perspectives. And it's very hard to know how much hate there is.

02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:05.480
Outside of this conflict. So my primary question is, and this is what I asked a lot of people when I

02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:13.400
visited Ukraine is, will you ever be able to forgive the Russians? And a lot of people said,

02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:22.280
never, never. So this isn't just about assuming we win, they would say. Assuming we win, we still

02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:29.320
will not ever forgive. Never forgive. And they said it in a way where like,

02:31:30.440 --> 02:31:35.240
not only us, but our children will never forgive. And it wasn't just, you know what,

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:40.600
it wasn't just about Russia or the Russian leadership, it's about the Russian people.

02:31:44.280 --> 02:31:48.520
But a lot of people also said that this is our feeling currently, we understand.

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:53.560
You're lost in the rage of war because you lose so much.

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:56.840
I mean, if you asked Americans, would you ever be friends with Germany or Japan?

02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:59.080
It'd be like, are you kidding? After Pearl Harbor?

02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:04.120
Yeah. But of course, most Americans didn't feel Pearl Harbor is different.

02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:12.680
It's a good point when it's your own land. But imagine it wasn't just Pearl Harbor,

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:20.520
but it was New York and Chicago and Dallas and all these cities being bombed. Yeah.

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:35.480
Just to linger on this war in Ukraine currently, does it break your heart to see what's going on

02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:43.320
there now that it's on the same land as the same cities, the same stories are now brought back to

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:49.960
the surface, like the generational pain as it was in the time that you're writing about?

02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:55.160
Do you think it's a fundamentally different country, different war, different situation,

02:32:55.160 --> 02:33:01.400
or do you hear echoes of the same? I don't think it's the same because

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:11.160
I think there is no one who is like, I'm glad this is happening to the Ukrainian people.

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:18.600
So even the people who are for Putin and for the invasion and whatever justification they

02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:24.840
might have for his war, no one is like, yeah, let's get those darn Ukrainians.

02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:32.200
I think there was that sense in America after 9-11 when we invade Afghanistan and Iraq and

02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:39.000
there was like F those Iraqis, F those Afghan people. Whereas now I think it's completely

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:45.720
opposite. I also think a lot of Russians, I'm sure if I ask them, they're not thinking like,

02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:49.960
let's wipe the Ukrainian people off the map. I think whatever reasons they have, it's not

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:54.280
going after this. Even if you have to rile up people against the citizenry,

02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:02.200
it's not to that level of the hatred, the Kulaks' hatred of those villages.

02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:06.040
There's still a belief though amongst the soldiers outside the big cities,

02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:10.920
their belief that the Ukrainian people who the Russian soldiers believe are their brothers and

02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:16.200
sisters are occupied by an evil regime. So you need to save them from the evil regime.

02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:23.880
That's also very different from the Holodomor. And also there is dispute in the press

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:31.080
about the causes, the consequences, the victims, the villains of Putin's war.

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:38.360
But when it came to this, no one is denying that the war is happening. The New York Times isn't

02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.880
saying everything is fine and the only reason people are saying it's a problem is because they

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:49.480
hate Putin or they hate Zelensky. That's not a thing. And the fact that we have so much footage

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:57.240
of what's happening in Ukraine. It takes two seconds to go on Google and you have a map of

02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:02.520
Russian advancement, what parts are they occupying, what parts are not under their control.

02:35:03.800 --> 02:35:08.360
I did a little live stream. I raised money for Ukrainian refugees to feed them because that's

02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:16.360
my concern, just keeping people fed. There was none of that. And the two people who spoke the

02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:21.400
truth, Gareth Jones was shot I think the day before his 30th birthday while he was

02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:28.440
uncovering news, I think it was in Mongolia. Malcolm Muggeridge had problem finding work

02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:35.240
when he exposed this. And I think like we were talking earlier, the ubiquity of things like

02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:40.920
cell phones and camera phones would make something like this, I don't know, I wouldn't say an

02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:47.480
impossibility. They could still do it, but it would be really hard to cover it up.

02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:53.960
Well, sort of to push back on that, if you just look at Iran, I would draw a difference. I agree

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:58.520
with you mostly, but I would also draw a different distinction when the atrocities happening to

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:05.320
your own people versus there's a war. Ukraine is a sovereign independent nation. There's now a war

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.600
between two nations. It feels like it's easier for journalists to somehow reveal the truth in that.

02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.800
When the atrocities happening within the Soviet Union, for some reason, that's easier to hide.

02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:20.920
That's easier for journalists to deceive themselves and easier for the authoritarian leader to hide

02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:26.280
the information. I think I agree with you. And so that's the dark. I mean, that's why people maybe,

02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:33.880
maybe you can educate me on this, but this is why I think people don't talk about

02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:42.360
the Great Leap Forward and other atrocities because it's inside the country versus the

02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:55.080
Holocaust that's part of a war. Why is that we're too almost afraid, too polite? What is it that we

02:36:55.080 --> 02:37:00.200
don't want to cover the atrocities inside the country? It's their business, so we don't want

02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:07.080
to touch it. What is it? I think it's that what we refer to as the news is in the business of

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:13.560
selling narratives, right? And the narrative of the Holocaust is a very powerful one, which is

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:23.080
if you let hatred of a subgroup in a population get out of control, this is the ultimate consequence.

02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.160
And this is something that we all have to be scared of and do everything in our power to

02:37:27.160 --> 02:37:33.960
avoid in the future for any out group. Whereas what's the narrative of the holodomor? Sometimes

02:37:33.960 --> 02:37:37.720
governments kill their own citizens. There's nothing you could do about it. There's nothing

02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:43.080
they wouldn't have let us send food. The newspapers, even Russia weren't acknowledging it.

02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:50.200
This is some of the issues I had with regard to trying to advocate for the North Korean people.

02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:54.280
The reporters would be like, well, what can I do as an American? It's a very natural question.

02:37:54.280 --> 02:38:00.360
And I'm like, I don't know. All I know is how to speak to what is happening. But in terms of next

02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:06.600
steps, I don't have a good answer for you. So that is where the news kind of does break down.

02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:13.080
If there isn't a story or a call to action, you're kind of almost like having a movie with a

02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.480
cliffhanger and there's no sequel. It's like, what am I supposed to do here? This is not scratching

02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:23.400
that itch, which for me, as a consumer of news, a layman is like, okay, here's the story. There was

02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:27.720
a bad guy and the cops shot him or they took him to jail and now the bad guy's caught, beginning,

02:38:27.720 --> 02:38:33.400
middle, end. Here, it's just like Mao did this. A lot of people were executed and starved. Isn't

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:38.440
that awful? Well, Mao is still in power. Now Richard Nixon is raising a toast to him. That

02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:44.520
story is just like, how am I supposed to feel about this? Yeah. It feels like when there's tanks

02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:49.320
and there's war and this military conflict, then it's more actionable. You can cover it.

02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.440
Yeah. It did seem like Nazi Germany. I don't know if the Holocaust was the thing that made

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:59.160
it most coverable. I think it was that this is a threat to the entire civilization.

02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:03.720
Yeah, we were at war with them. Yeah. That's what makes it coverable. If the Holocaust was

02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:10.040
happening just inside a country, inside of Germany, or even if it didn't expand beyond Poland.

02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:15.640
Yeah, it would be like a footnote. It was in many ways a footnote. Many of the early steps toward it

02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:19.560
they didn't cover it. It's just like, all right, they're being oppressive toward their own people.

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:25.320
Okay. Especially given some of the, maybe if you negotiate certain peace treaties with the

02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:34.840
Soviet Union and with Germany, you're too the pacifist imperative. Oh boy. Sorry, Santa.

02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.160
Is that what you say every time you masturbate? No. After you're done, sorry.

02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:51.400
All right. See, I hate it when you don't yes and because it leaves me in a hole I dug for myself

02:39:53.640 --> 02:40:00.840
and I sit there in a hole in my sadness. How long have you been writing this book?

02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:05.000
I mean, two years. Mentally, it was like two years since you spent time with it.

02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:11.880
No, almost three, two and a half, yeah. I suppose it stages you much longer. Like you said,

02:40:11.880 --> 02:40:16.920
your family. In many ways, this is a book you've been writing your whole life.

02:40:17.640 --> 02:40:20.200
I think that's fair that all my work's been leading to this, yeah.

02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:23.480
It's certainly the most, in my opinion, the most important thing I've done.

02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:32.440
What stands out to you about Holodomor? What moments, what aspects of human nature stand out to you?

02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:40.600
I don't know. I think that story is, I don't want to say story, but I mean like that incident

02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.560
is, I mean I was familiar with it before, you know what I mean? So I kind of knew about it,

02:40:47.560 --> 02:40:54.600
in part thanks to kind of the North Korean work and coming from Ukraine. The thing that was also

02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:00.440
kind of insane about it is that they were taking all this grain and not using it even to feed the

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:09.320
Russian people. They were selling it for export, for hard currency. I think what the takeaway there

02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:14.600
and I think, again, this is something Westerners and especially Americans don't appreciate,

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:25.240
they think that evil often has like a logic to it, right? And it's like why would, like because it

02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:30.280
makes no sense to them, like why would they kill their own people? Therefore, it probably didn't

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:36.040
happen, right? There's that thing. They really think like, okay, they can understand, you know,

02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:41.880
country A conquers country B and slaughters a bunch of people country B as a means of conquest,

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:47.000
like that kind of makes sense to them. They know that thing, but like why are you starving all

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:51.800
these people? Like what are you gaining out of it? That doesn't make sense to them and because it

02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.880
doesn't make sense, there's kind of like, well, it's probably more of the story that I'm hearing

02:41:55.880 --> 02:42:04.440
and a lot of times there's not. It's just like evil for the sake of power and we don't really have

02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:12.440
that certainly anywhere near that scale and never have certainly, you know, since America

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:18.920
has been a thing. I mean, it's and the fact that this is like the 30s, you know what I mean? This

02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:29.880
isn't that long ago, but I think also the narrative in some ways is how, you know, technology is also

02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:34.680
something that kind of people have mixed feelings about. Like I said this before and this is something

02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:40.360
I really believe very strongly. The ability of information to be captured and spread easily

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:51.240
is such an effective tool in exposing humanity at its worst because it's one thing if I sit here

02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:56.680
and tell you what I saw in these villages. It's another thing that I sat you down and showed you

02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:01.240
YouTube and, you know, you and I don't know what it's like to look in the eyes of someone who's

02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.240
thinking about eating their own kids. I mean, and you see that face and you know it's, you know,

02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:14.920
not some CGI. It will haunt you forever. Just looking at the different mechanisms that made

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:20.280
all of this happen. So this is not just one guy, Stalin, having a policy. There's a whole system.

02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:27.080
I mean, one of it is just a system of fear, but how do you implement that system of fear?

02:43:27.960 --> 02:43:34.920
Well, there's a giant bureaucracy of fear. Yeah, so what he implemented with The Great Terror is-

02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:36.920
That's in the late 30s.

02:43:38.040 --> 02:43:45.000
It's throughout the 30s, but yeah, like it starts in the mid to late 30s. Basically, you know,

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:50.040
communism was based on the common good and the public good and anything private which was

02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.840
bourgeois was a problem. When they were started, you know, when the revolution came,

02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:00.280
the October Revolution, they wanted to recreate society entirely and that included like, okay,

02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:06.920
let's make it so everyone eats in like cafeterias so they're not eating by themselves. Let's

02:44:06.920 --> 02:44:11.560
design buildings so everyone has to share bathrooms. Like their whole plan was to have

02:44:11.560 --> 02:44:17.080
eliminate any kind of concept of privacy at all. They also had this bizarre kind of radical idea of

02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.920
attacking shame. So many of these, you know, before the 1917, people were also very involved

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:27.720
like free love because the idea of having this private bond between husband and wife was also

02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:33.160
bourgeois and old-fashioned and, you know, we're the society of the future. That changed relatively

02:44:33.160 --> 02:44:38.600
quickly, but they were talking about things like raising kids communally and so on and so forth.

02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:46.040
So for Stalin, if you and I are friends, we have a bond. That's a threat to him. The family's a

02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:53.000
threat. Any kind of organization is a threat because it's a power center that is not between

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.160
a relationship between you and him. Now you have a relationship with somebody else. So he

02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:04.920
systemically went through that whole society and, you know, it became, there were certain things

02:45:04.920 --> 02:45:11.000
that became a crime. Then it became a crime to be a spouse of the enemy of the people. Now right away,

02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:16.200
I as a child become an orphan because my dad was an enemy of the people. My mom is married to an

02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:21.960
enemy of the people. Now I don't have parents. They get arrested or executed or whatever, but now

02:45:21.960 --> 02:45:26.840
I have nowhere to go, but I can't go to my friend's house because their family doesn't want to take in

02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:33.560
a child at the enemy of the people. You had this culture where everyone was very much encouraged

02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:39.720
to turn people in and if you turn, if you're arrested, you know, and tortured, you're like,

02:45:39.720 --> 02:45:44.280
okay, who are your accomplices? And now you just got to name names, people you knew,

02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.360
and then it becomes this whole chain. And it's like, how am I going to protest my innocence

02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:54.920
if Lex just said, you know, I worked with Michael and we were working with Trotskyists

02:45:54.920 --> 02:45:59.960
and we were plotting to overthrow Stalin. Lex testified to this. He signed a confession.

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:04.920
What am I supposed to do now, right? So it worked its way in a most viral fashion

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:09.960
through the whole society. There was this amazing moment where these poor people,

02:46:09.960 --> 02:46:13.720
peasants, because obviously the powerless are often going to be caught in the web.

02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:19.160
They were going to jail for being Trotskyites and they had to ask themselves, what's a Tractorist?

02:46:19.160 --> 02:46:24.920
Like they didn't even know who Trotsky was. And the other thing is ethnicity was a problem,

02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:30.840
right? If you were an ethnicity, you have more power with other members of that ethnicity than

02:46:30.840 --> 02:46:37.240
you have with this kind of broader Soviet culture. So he would just deport entire populations from

02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:42.120
their ancestral lands to other parts, A, to spread the population around, but also to break

02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:48.760
that link between the peoples and their lands. There was this 1937 NKVD order against Polish

02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:54.440
people where it's just like, if you had come from Poland or had been just this whole list,

02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:59.720
and basically people were being arrested because they had Polish last names and I think it was a

02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:07.480
million people were killed, like some astronomical number. So there was this, anything that was a

02:47:07.480 --> 02:47:15.480
bond was a threat to him and it went systemically. So after he had all these kind of executions of

02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:19.560
people who were like Lenin's people, the old Bolsheviks, then he went after, he started

02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:24.920
arresting the secret police. He arrested all the cops, he arrested all the judges and all these

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:29.640
prisoners got to see the judges who yelled at them for being counter-revolutionaries and spies.

02:47:29.640 --> 02:47:34.600
Now they were in the jails. If you were a foreigner, there was a huge push from the

02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:38.440
Soviet Union toward African-Americans, right? Because they're like, look, you were living in

02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:47.160
a racist country, here we have no racial inequality, come live here. A bunch of them went and they were

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.160
all vanished. Anyone who knew information about the outside world, if you were a foreigner,

02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:57.000
Andre Babel, I forget his first name, he had a French writer he was friends with,

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:01.000
he was arrested and shot because he's a spy because you're friends with Melrose and that means if

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:05.800
you're a foreigner, you're a spy. Speaking Esperanto became a crime, having a pen pal,

02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:11.080
literally anything that was some kind of chain between yourself and someone else was a threat

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:19.000
and was grounds for arrest. The Russians would joke about how relieved they would be if someone

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.880
knocked on your door in the middle of the night to tell you your house was on fire

02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:27.160
because it wasn't the NKVD coming to arrest you. And of course, most of the accusations probably

02:48:27.160 --> 02:48:34.920
were completely false. So not only could you not do all of those things, you were also a victim of

02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:40.440
just being late to work became a felony and also not doing your job became a felony because now

02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.560
you're taking food or product away from the people and you're supposed to be there working

02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:51.400
for the people. There's this one story which I was doing the audiobook and I still try and

02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:56.840
get through without crying. This was 1920, they were a bunch of kids in Moscow who were pickpockets

02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:02.040
between ages 11 and 15. They rounded them up and they're like, all right, point out your accomplices

02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:05.400
and they would take them in the trams and you have to point out people, then they would take

02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:10.840
them back to the cellar, beat the crap out of these children and then they take them out again

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.040
and if they didn't point out to anybody, they'd beat them. They're like, all right, so they just

02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:18.360
start pointing at random and the thing that was really sick about this story, if that wasn't sick

02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:24.120
enough, is that the screams that the other criminals, the adult hardened criminals had to

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:28.680
hear from these children as they realized they were being taken back to the cellar. It was just

02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:29.960
horrifying.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:37.720
And they, so they tortured people, they tortured confessions out of people.

02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:37.960
Yes.

02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:39.800
At scale.

02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:40.200
Oh, yes.

02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:49.960
I mean, and the dark aspect of this is it's all, it's like this weird, it's a bureaucracy of torture.

02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:50.280
Yes.

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:56.200
So like, it's not like there's, what is it? The torturer is afraid of,

02:49:57.560 --> 02:50:00.440
like does it so that he doesn't become the prisoner.

02:50:00.440 --> 02:50:05.080
Right, because then it's like, oh, you couldn't get a confession out of him? Are you an enemy

02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:10.440
that people know as well? And the thing that was even crazier is that a lot of these interrogators

02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:16.600
were frustrated because they're like, look, we both know you're innocent. Just sign this confession

02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:22.760
and make my life easier. They knew it was crap. Stalin joked about, Stalin joked about this. This

02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:30.600
is one of his little jokes. There was a kid who was arrested and he was said, oh, was forced to

02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:35.640
say, you wrote Eugene O'Nagin, which is a play. He goes, that play was by Pushkin and they tortured

02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:39.000
him and they tortured him and tortured him. And then his parents are walking down the street

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.760
and they run into a secret police and they go, congratulations. And they go for what? They go,

02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:47.800
your son wrote Eugene O'Nagin. Like he admitted to it last night. Like it's just like, they could

02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:53.720
get you to say anything. And what else was really, really sick, which they understood is it, they

02:50:53.720 --> 02:50:58.040
lowered the death penalty for kids. I think it's either 14 or 12. I don't remember off the top of

02:50:58.040 --> 02:51:04.520
my head. And what Stalin's head of the secret police did is when you were interrogating someone,

02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:12.440
you either had to have some of that family member's possessions on the desk or a copy of

02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:18.200
the decree that's saying that they can go after your family. And the amount of people who would

02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.760
confess to anything when they saw their family was in danger and they knew this wasn't a bluff,

02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:28.600
was astronomical. And then it becomes a chain. Because if you confess and I have your confession,

02:51:28.600 --> 02:51:34.120
how hard is it to get your neighbor? What do you make of the, for a time,

02:51:34.120 --> 02:51:41.480
for most of the time, the NKVD was about the head of NKVD, Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria?

02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:49.240
No, Beria, yeah. I have a death warrant signed by him hanging in my kitchen that I acquired. He was

02:51:49.240 --> 02:51:56.040
one of the most evil people who ever lived. The thing that Americans don't appreciate is

02:51:56.040 --> 02:52:03.800
how clever some of this sadism is. So there was one actress, I think he took her back to his house

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:09.000
and he asked her to, he tried to get her to sleep with him and he promised her that if she did,

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:12.360
her father and either her husband or her grandfather, I don't remember which one it was,

02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:15.400
is going to be released from jail. Well, they were already dead at that point. He had them

02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:21.480
executed. They're still finding the bodies of the women he murdered in the grounds of his dacha.

02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:26.120
It's an embassy now. And the thing is Stalin knew, because at one point, there's a picture

02:52:26.120 --> 02:52:30.600
of Stalin's daughter in his lap and she was at his house one day and Stalin calls up. He goes,

02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:37.320
get out of there immediately. So he, like a good bureaucrat, he kept a list of all of his

02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:44.360
sexual partners. It's still sealed, but both him and his bodyguard had this list. So just to clarify,

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:51.960
he headed the operation that did this whole giant mechanism of forced confessions. He was part of

02:52:51.960 --> 02:52:55.800
expanding the gulags. So he wasn't the head of the gulags, but he was part of this giant machine.

02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:58.840
And his famous quote was, show me the man and I'll show you the crime.

02:53:00.200 --> 02:53:06.840
But on top of that, what you're describing is he was also related or not, was also just a mass

02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:11.640
rapist. Yes. And there's some dispute about whether he went after kids with his rapes,

02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:16.760
but there's plenty of adult women that were targets for this. There was also another little

02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:21.560
joke about him, about how Stalin is looking for his pipe and he can't find it and he calls Beria.

02:53:21.560 --> 02:53:25.000
And he's like, okay, I can't find this pipe. And in the afternoon, he calls Beria again. He's like,

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:28.440
oh, I found the pipe. He goes, but comrade Stalin, we've got four people to confess to steal it

02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:32.840
already. So you have to laugh, but then you think about the nature of how it operates.

02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:40.520
Well, it also the fact that this kind of person was allowed to run. I mean, I suppose it's all

02:53:40.520 --> 02:53:47.640
different kinds of evil and rape was just a part of the story. His own personal willingness to

02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:56.760
oversee torture and commit torture himself and rape. But it's also what happens when you're in

02:53:56.760 --> 02:54:02.280
a country where it has no rights of any kind. And by the way, I should mention that people should

02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:07.000
get your book and audio. When is your audio book coming out? It's in a couple of weeks.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:12.440
So it'll be out shortly. Yeah. You gave me the great honor of voicing this man. That's for the

02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:20.440
promo. Yeah. For the promo. Yeah. Excellent. I appreciate that. For a moment, I actually,

02:54:21.960 --> 02:54:27.560
it was really difficult. Really? Yeah. It was just a sentence. I understand. I understand.

02:54:31.400 --> 02:54:35.720
Cause it takes you to that place. Oh yeah. Cause he told her scream if you want, doesn't matter.

02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:41.000
And he was right. That's the thing. He wasn't bluffing. These women could scream their head

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:45.480
off. No one's going to come help him. He would drive around Moscow at night in his limo looking

02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:51.560
for victims. But somehow me saying those words was tough. I'm sure. It was tough.

02:54:53.720 --> 02:54:57.480
Cause this is where we came from. Do you know what I mean? This isn't just like some kind of

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:03.480
Tolkien villain. But it also was tough because I could see myself being somewhere in that machine

02:55:03.480 --> 02:55:14.760
somewhere. Somehow that put me right there. Any cog in that machine is committing evil.

02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:25.240
Yes. That's the dark thing. I think the higher you are to the top, the closer you are to the top,

02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:35.800
the more ability you have to stop it. But the less, the more freedom you have to stop it, I suppose.

02:55:37.240 --> 02:55:44.600
To a point, yeah. But like the little things. So Beria had the freedom to commit rape

02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:55.160
or not to. And so he chooses to increase the amount of evil he's putting out into the world.

02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.760
But then you have to counterbalance that as dark as this calculus is. After Stalin dies,

02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:09.000
that week, they start making the gulag shrink. They start pulling back on the labor camps.

02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:19.320
That is a big plus in his side. You start having this mass amnesty and freeing people from

02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:29.720
work camps. That's not a minor thing. So it's crazy. I'm not saying Peter. I'm not saying he's

02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:35.800
a good person, but it's kind of insane that someone can do things that everyone listening to this

02:56:35.800 --> 02:56:42.920
would regard as pure evil. And at the same time, this guy also, when the time came, saved

02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:49.560
tens of thousands of lives. So in some sense, Stalin is the kind of cancer that permeates all

02:56:49.560 --> 02:56:54.680
of the Soviet minds. And once it's gone, you almost like wake up, wait a minute,

02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:01.080
what the fuck was I a part of? And Khrushchev was at 56 when he gave his secret speech

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:07.720
behind closed doors. And he's just like, all this criticism of Stalin was true. This is completely

02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:11.400
not what Marxism is. He tried to salvage the system. This is not what Marxism is about.

02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:19.560
We can't have a personality cult. Stalin killed all these top generals. And when Hitler betrayed

02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.800
the pact and invaded, Stalin didn't believe his buddy Hitler was going to do this. And as a result

02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:28.760
of this, we lost a lot of territory and lives. This is not a military genius. This was Stalin being

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:39.000
an idiot or a moron, whatever term you want to be. But the thing is, Khrushchev also was a butcher.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:44.440
He had a lot of blood in his hands. You don't take Stalin's seat without having overlooked a

02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:52.440
lot of murder and chaos. That's why it's called, subtitled books, The Tale of Good and Evil.

02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:59.000
There's so much malevolence to go around. What do you think was going through Stalin's mind

02:57:59.800 --> 02:58:14.120
in the 20s and the 30s? Did he directly allow himself to acknowledge the reality

02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:20.360
of the suffering he was causing? What does it take to be that human? I'm almost interested

02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:28.280
to extract lessons from that for leaders of today. How hard is it? Is it that Stalin is evil

02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:35.000
or can you just dilute yourself gradually into where you don't have a sense of the effect of

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:39.880
your policies in the populace? Well, you're not diluting yourself because you have around you

02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:47.560
an entire government of people telling you 24-7 how great you are, how thankful they are for you,

02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:53.080
how awesome you are, you're the best. That's certainly going to play into it. I've asked

02:58:53.080 --> 02:58:58.920
myself that question as well. Do these people believe their own bullshit? I think the receipts

02:58:58.920 --> 02:59:04.520
are when Elena Ceaușescu, who's one of the four women on the cover, when she's being taken away

02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:10.200
to be executed in 1989, she's yelling at the soldiers, how could you? I raised you like a

02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:17.800
mother. So she at least believed her own bullshit. With Stalin, he was obviously extremely

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:24.200
intelligent. I think it's kind of easy for us to kind of psychologize and say he's a sociopath,

02:59:24.200 --> 02:59:31.160
he's a narcissist, he's this, he's that. But at a certain point, like if you're surrounded

02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:38.120
by a culture dedicated to glorifying you and everyone you meet is so happy to see you,

02:59:38.200 --> 02:59:43.400
and oh my God, all your pronouncements are so good, and you know what? If you make a decision

02:59:43.400 --> 02:59:47.880
that's wrong, the people around you, it's their job to tell you why it's not your fault. It's the

02:59:47.880 --> 02:59:54.440
fault of the wreckers or it's the fault of Hitler or whoever it is, the Kulaks. At a certain point,

02:59:54.440 --> 03:00:00.280
the human mind wants to believe how great it is, especially someone in that vaunted position.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:06.040
But he had his, there was this one funny, I'm using the word loosely quote, when Hitler invades

03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:11.880
Russia and he couldn't believe it and he's just missing in action for days because how could Hitler

03:00:11.880 --> 03:00:17.000
betray me? We had a deal, birds of a feather, and he had this quote about like we've taken Lenin's

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:22.760
legacy and shit it out our asses. I think he was very aware, that's no question that he was aware

03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:27.640
that in terms of being a philosopher or a thinker, he wasn't on Lenin's level. He was on Lenin's

03:00:27.720 --> 03:00:34.520
level. So that was, I'm sure, played a lot into his psychology.

03:00:35.880 --> 03:00:41.720
He never quite lived up to everything he tried. I mean, there's some sense that the collectivization,

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:50.600
that this idea was a failure. The way he responds to the economic policy being a failure

03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:57.960
is to lean in and basically torture anyone who says it's a failure and double down on

03:00:57.960 --> 03:01:03.480
the policy. That says something about- But it wasn't a failure, it broke the Ukrainians.

03:01:04.760 --> 03:01:10.200
You don't think he believed early on, that's what it turned into, but you don't think in the very

03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:18.520
early days, there was a thought that collectivization is the right mechanism by which to enact

03:01:18.520 --> 03:01:27.160
communism in the nation. I think his goal was to break their spirit and getting them fed was

03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:32.600
secondary, right? And given the fact that they stopped complaining because they're dead,

03:01:33.400 --> 03:01:39.880
he got what he wanted. He got a compliant population. I mean, that's really interesting.

03:01:41.640 --> 03:01:46.920
I wonder how much disagreement there is about, because if that was the goal from the beginning,

03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:53.800
that's a different level of evil. Like I said earlier, he broke with Lenin because he

03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:58.760
wanted socialism in one country, right? That was his vision, right? And he was also very aware

03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:03.560
that what became the Soviet Union was extremely diverse. First of all, it's a gigantic country,

03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:08.920
it's the big country on earth. It's not always gigantic. You had all these peoples, these

03:02:08.920 --> 03:02:13.800
nationalities within it that have had historical enmity and they're not going to have loyalty to

03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:19.560
Moscow. He's a Georgian himself. This was always a big problem. So that was what he wanted to do as

03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:27.080
well, is to homogenize and have them be standardized. And I don't see how you do that without either

03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:33.800
massive re-education, which is only going to go so far, or really just crushing people's spirits.

03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:40.200
So like a forced homogeneity.

03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:49.000
Yeah. And the other big thing, a big element of Soviet culture and the Soviet mythology.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:53.400
I mean, he changed his name to Stalin. I can't even pronounce his Georgian name,

03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:59.080
Jurgisvili or something like that. It means man of steel. And this still remains in

03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:03.320
Russian culture to this day. I see it in my family too, and like other Russians I know.

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:08.760
There is this pride in ruthlessness and this kind of like, I'm so tough, like nothing's going to

03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:13.480
affect me. Like, yeah, we're going to suffer, but it's for a greater good or for the long term and

03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.960
not to be kind of sentimental or squeamish about things. Like that was a big part of it.

03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:21.560
Don't take that away from me too, Michael. You've taken everything.

03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:22.120
Am I wrong?

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:31.000
I admire, not stoicism, but that kind of hardness. I look forward to myself.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.280
That has nothing to do with Stalin.

03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:39.560
But not to the extent that like, for example, like if you see someone suffering

03:03:40.520 --> 03:03:44.120
and that's being used as a mechanism to get you to change your opinion, you're like,

03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:47.880
they're not going to get to me. Like that is very much part of that Russian psychology.

03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:51.080
Right. At least at that time.

03:03:51.080 --> 03:03:57.240
Yes. I think still largely no. I'm not going to be manipulated by someone else's suffering

03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:00.600
or weakness, that kind of thing. I think that's really part of it to this day.

03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:05.000
I don't know. I don't know how much of it is character, how much of it is reality.

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:05.640
Sure. Sure.

03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:14.040
I remember I knew that I knew someone who was him and his fiance were Russian

03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:20.360
and they had this big fight she took off the ring. Right. And she's like, you know,

03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:24.680
he's like, that's it. And just like the way he told the story to me, she's like,

03:04:24.680 --> 03:04:29.240
what do you want me to say? Oh, don't leave me baby. I can't live without you.

03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:31.560
Like that nasty cruelty.

03:04:35.160 --> 03:04:37.880
I don't know if there's a Russian thing. That's just the people thing.

03:04:38.440 --> 03:04:39.880
I don't think that's an American thing.

03:04:42.040 --> 03:04:47.960
I think there's all kinds of flavors and they're different by region of the way that people are

03:04:47.960 --> 03:04:50.360
cruel to each other. Sure. I'm not arguing that.

03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:55.000
In America, New Jersey is different than Texas is different than California.

03:04:55.000 --> 03:05:02.120
You don't think Americans are a higher trust, more kind society than Russia even today?

03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:09.640
Higher trust. Listen, I'm not going to. So first of all, I have very complex

03:05:11.640 --> 03:05:15.480
feelings about Russia today. I'm talking about January before the war.

03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:20.200
I'm talking about nowadays. I think it's a complex psychological

03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:25.960
dynamic of what trusting means. I think Russians are generally less friendly,

03:05:25.960 --> 03:05:30.680
but have more intimate friendships. Yes, I think that's true.

03:05:30.680 --> 03:05:34.760
So it's just a different. It's not different. It's just one is more trusting.

03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:37.320
Which is more trusting? Americans.

03:05:38.440 --> 03:05:41.800
But then we define trusting different because.

03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:45.560
Okay. I'll give you an example. If someone's having a party in America and people come over,

03:05:46.520 --> 03:05:49.640
okay, that's fine. Everyone's welcome. If it's in Russia, it's like, who's that?

03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:54.280
Who'd you bring? And there's much more of a like, let me be sure that it's okay if this person's here.

03:05:54.280 --> 03:05:56.280
Maybe. You don't have parties.

03:05:57.240 --> 03:05:59.800
I have never been at a party. And you don't come to mine.

03:06:01.800 --> 03:06:05.000
Ben Aster was very sad. Well, I love Ben.

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:06.840
I love Ben. Well, you should have showed it by showing up.

03:06:07.880 --> 03:06:11.720
Man, I'm a high height from the world and I'm afraid of social interaction.

03:06:12.520 --> 03:06:16.120
And I just lay on the ground instead and feel sorry for myself.

03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:18.200
It's not bad Santa. It's sad Santa.

03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:24.040
Well, I can serve. I can serve my emotional energy towards this one day of the year.

03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:27.720
Okay. Intensely spread my joy.

03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:32.200
All right. Speaking of which, you tell a Christmas story in the book.

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.800
Are you spoiling that chapter? It's called Die Hard.

03:06:35.800 --> 03:06:38.680
All right. Well, I'm not going to spoil it. It's really good.

03:06:38.680 --> 03:06:40.280
I was very proud of that chapter.

03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:44.280
Why? Because the ending that's a Christmas story is just like,

03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:48.200
I know everyone reading is going to go Google it and be like, these can't be real, but it was real.

03:06:48.200 --> 03:06:49.400
That it was a Christmas yesterday.

03:06:50.680 --> 03:06:55.720
I mean, this has to do with the bigger picture. We don't have to do the big reveal,

03:06:55.720 --> 03:07:00.760
but the bigger picture of there was an Iron Curtain and it was coming down in complex ways.

03:07:01.640 --> 03:07:05.400
How would you define the Iron Curtain? There's a set of ideologies,

03:07:05.400 --> 03:07:09.720
a set of countries united by an ideology and a set of countries united by a different ideology.

03:07:10.520 --> 03:07:16.600
And there's a curtain that divided them and it eventually came down.

03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:18.600
So how would you describe how it came down?

03:07:20.600 --> 03:07:25.720
It came, I hate that I can never remember, ever, ever remember if this was Hemingway.

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:27.880
No, it was Hemingway.

03:07:27.880 --> 03:07:29.160
It was Mark Twain.

03:07:29.160 --> 03:07:31.960
No, it came down two ways, gradually, then suddenly.

03:07:32.920 --> 03:07:39.560
The thing with the Iron Curtain and the Warsaw Pact, these were a bunch of nations

03:07:39.560 --> 03:07:47.400
with, you know, run under communism, but they were all, almost all, under the sway of Moscow.

03:07:48.120 --> 03:07:52.760
So if they were going to make big changes, Moscow had to prove it.

03:07:53.560 --> 03:08:02.920
It was in the 50s when Hungary decided to rebel, or not rebel, liberalize, and they even were

03:08:02.920 --> 03:08:07.880
thinking of leaving the Warsaw Pact and the Russians sending the tanks. And you had the

03:08:07.880 --> 03:08:12.600
development of what was called the Brezhnev Doctrine, which was the idea that it is the

03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:18.840
duty of all the Warsaw Pact nations if another country tries to, and this was also in 68 in the

03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:25.720
Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia, if a nation wants to leave socialism, it is incumbent on

03:08:25.720 --> 03:08:29.960
the other socialist nations to do whatever is necessary to make sure there isn't a counter

03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:41.880
revolution. So they were very much under Moscow's thumb. And one of the big ways it changed was

03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:49.560
one man, and that was Mikhail Gorbachev. And he was the first Russian leader to be born after

03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:55.320
the October Revolution. He grew up and his grandfather was arrested for being a Trotskyite,

03:08:55.320 --> 03:09:00.680
and the other one, you know, was arrested for this or that. He saw his village starve as a result of

03:09:00.680 --> 03:09:09.160
Stalin. So even though he was a very committed communist, he also was very and increasingly

03:09:09.240 --> 03:09:16.040
skeptical of authoritarianism. And, you know, in Poland, for example, you had the Solidarity

03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:21.960
Movement, and this was a labor union movement, and the government didn't know what to do. They

03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:26.680
were getting a lot of support from the peoples. They had strikes, and the Gdansk Shipyard was

03:09:26.680 --> 03:09:32.600
when them started. And basically Moscow told them, either you crack down or we're cracking down on

03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:36.520
you. And they're like, all right, and they declared martial law and they, you know,

03:09:36.520 --> 03:09:40.920
rest of the leaders put them away. But then when Gorbachev, you know, was in charge,

03:09:41.560 --> 03:09:45.720
there wasn't a gun to their back. And it was the communist leaders themselves who were like,

03:09:45.720 --> 03:09:50.520
you know what, there's this really funny moment where Lech Walesa is meeting with Margaret

03:09:50.520 --> 03:09:56.280
Thatcher, and he's telling her what solidarity the movement wants. And she had been meeting

03:09:56.280 --> 03:10:02.280
with the Polish government as well. And she's like, look, like, tell them, like what, because

03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:06.920
they had, you tried, they wanted, the government wanted her to tell them that we want to negotiate

03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:10.200
and work things out. She goes, all right, tell the government what it is that you're asking for.

03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:13.560
And he just points to the ceiling. She goes, he's like, oh yeah, our meetings are bugged anyway.

03:10:14.680 --> 03:10:22.280
But they then had the freedom because they knew that Gorbachev wasn't forcing them to drive

03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:26.360
solidarity underground. So they had the idea of like, let's work together with these people.

03:10:26.360 --> 03:10:33.400
And as a result of this, you know, Poland liberalized and freed itself fairly easily,

03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:38.760
and with a minimum of bloodshed in 89. And there was this whole argument for the Vietnam war with

03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:42.760
something called domino theory, which is if you use Vietnam, then you're going to lose Laos,

03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:45.560
then you can lose Cambodia. One by one, the countries are going to turn communist to the

03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:50.680
dominoes. But people didn't realize the reverse was true. Because after Poland liberalized, then

03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:58.200
you have Hungary, then you have Czechoslovakia, then you had East Germany and the fall of the

03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:04.600
Berlin Wall. So it's a great thing because as this is happening, the people are looking around

03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:11.320
and they're like, wait, that's it? This has got to be a trick. And it wasn't a trick. So

03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:16.760
one of my favorite books, which was a big inspiration for this one, was by my favorite

03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:22.040
historian. I apologize to Victor Petrusa, David Petrusa and Arthur Hermann, my second and third.

03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:28.760
They're tied. But Victor Sebastian wrote a book called Revolution, 1989. And he just talked about

03:11:28.760 --> 03:11:34.600
that year and how all these countries, one after another, liberalized. And it's just such a beauty.

03:11:34.600 --> 03:11:40.680
And none of them thought this was possible. One of my favorite, favorite moments in this book

03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:47.240
is Helmut Kohl, who was the head of West Germany, is in Warsaw with Lech Walesa discussing the

03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:52.440
Berlin Wall. And Lech Walesa is like, I don't think it's getting around for another few years.

03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:59.880
And Helmut Kohl laughs in his face. And he goes, look, you're young. This isn't how things work.

03:11:59.880 --> 03:12:05.320
This is going to take some doing. It fell the next day. And Helmut Kohl literally says,

03:12:05.320 --> 03:12:09.160
I'm at the wrong party. And he got on a plane and got out of Warsaw.

03:12:09.160 --> 03:12:16.200
So there are, why this book has a broader message than the actual stories of these incidents,

03:12:16.760 --> 03:12:23.160
is that as these wonderful things are happening, the universal consensus at the time is,

03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:27.720
it's never going to happen. Or if it does happen, it's going to happen only through an enormous

03:12:27.720 --> 03:12:32.840
amount of carnage and blood. And when it doesn't, then everyone's like, oh, it was inevitable.

03:12:33.480 --> 03:12:37.000
You didn't say it was inevitable at the time. You only said it was inevitable after the fact.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:43.880
And the other thing that really brought me a lot of joy is there are so many moments of men with

03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:51.400
guns saying, we're not shooting anyone. Because they wanted several Tiananmen squares. They wanted

03:12:51.400 --> 03:13:00.520
it in East Berlin. They wanted it in Romania. They wanted it in Moscow. And these strong, tough,

03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:07.560
trained men with guns were like, no, we're not shooting the civilians. And then everything else

03:13:07.560 --> 03:13:16.360
was history. Yeah. Just as surprising as the mass violence committed by police and the army on its

03:13:16.360 --> 03:13:23.640
own citizenry, equally surprising is when they choose not to, somehow. Yeah. And what is that?

03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:33.880
How do you explain 1989? How do you explain this progress that happened so suddenly? How do you

03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:42.680
explain that at the beginning of the 20th century, so much revolution happened that created communism?

03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:49.000
And how do you explain then the collapse of that across so many nations at the same time?

03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:56.760
I think a large part of it had to do with the closer interconnections between people like

03:13:56.760 --> 03:14:01.880
Gorbachev and Thatcher and Gorbachev and Reagan. Because both of them visited Red Square. And

03:14:02.440 --> 03:14:07.960
in the years before, these are enemies. They want to invade. They want to kill us. The Americans

03:14:07.960 --> 03:14:11.160
thought this about the Russians. The Russians thought this about the Americans. Obviously,

03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:18.840
not so much the British. And they got on really well. When Gorbachev came to checkers,

03:14:18.840 --> 03:14:25.160
which is the prime minister's countryside estate, Thatcher sat him down and she's lecturing him

03:14:25.160 --> 03:14:28.440
about human rights and she's lecturing him about economics and she's lecturing him about this and

03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:32.840
that. And then she's lecturing him about why he's in eating while he's yelling at her. And he goes,

03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:40.840
Mrs. Thatcher, I know you have a lot of strong opinions. I do too. I haven't been sent here

03:14:40.840 --> 03:14:45.080
to recruit you to the Communist Party. And she just started laughing. But right away,

03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:52.280
there was such a sense in the air of we can do better. We're spending all this money on missiles.

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:58.120
We're spending all this money on the military. It's expensive. And for what? We don't have to

03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:03.560
be looking at each other as enemies. We can try to work together to kind of, at the very least,

03:15:03.560 --> 03:15:10.520
lower the volume and the heat. How much credit do you give to Gorbachev the man? Meaning,

03:15:10.520 --> 03:15:14.840
how much power does a single individual have? I could not give him more credit.

03:15:15.640 --> 03:15:19.400
I had a tweet last year where I said, who do you think is the greatest person alive right now? And

03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:23.160
my answer by far would be Gorbachev. Then he died. I don't know who it is right now.

03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:25.960
But it's just funny because Gorbachev also had a tweet.

03:15:31.160 --> 03:15:39.880
And he said, oh, sure. That would be a good, now I wish I interviewed Gorbachev and asked him the

03:15:39.880 --> 03:15:45.560
famous question of what do you like best about Michael Maus? Look, the transition after the

03:15:45.560 --> 03:15:52.360
Soviet Union fell to Russia and Yeltsin was not a smooth one by any means. As I say at the end of

03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:57.480
the book, it's not like they lived happily ever after. But my broader point is you take the wins

03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:03.800
when you can get them. People now had access to passports. They can leave the country. They

03:16:03.800 --> 03:16:08.040
have food. They have access to information. It's somewhat censored, but it's certainly nothing like

03:16:08.040 --> 03:16:14.680
it was under the Soviet Union. And they didn't have to live in this kind of constant fear.

03:16:15.640 --> 03:16:20.840
And they had opportunities. It's such a step forward. And there was this one great moment.

03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:28.040
Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia. He's also mayor of Moscow at one point or the equivalent

03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:34.760
of mayor. And he came here to visit NASA in the capacity of one or the other. And while he was

03:16:34.760 --> 03:16:38.680
there, he went to visit a supermarket. It was a Randall's. Then I think it's a food town now.

03:16:38.680 --> 03:16:44.360
It still exists. I'm going to go there. I'm going to start balling. And as he's looking around,

03:16:45.720 --> 03:16:49.960
he had never seen so much food. And this is food that even wealthy people in Russia don't have

03:16:49.960 --> 03:16:57.880
access to. And there's pictures of him just like this. And the scene that really was poignant to me

03:16:57.880 --> 03:17:03.000
is on his flight back. He's sitting there on the plane like this. And he's like,

03:17:03.560 --> 03:17:09.480
they had to lie to the people because if they knew, they wouldn't have been able to get away

03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:15.160
with it. And that's the moment where it's just like, oh, this wasn't like skewed propaganda.

03:17:15.160 --> 03:17:22.680
This was like, they knew and it was a lie from A to Z. And he was just like, holy crap. And you

03:17:22.680 --> 03:17:26.920
could just imagine him on that plane, his brain reprogramming. Because if you're taught since

03:17:26.920 --> 03:17:30.760
you're a kid, and he was an older man, he was no dummy, you think, okay, the Americans are

03:17:30.760 --> 03:17:36.040
starving and poor and they're lynching people every day. And then you go to a supermarket,

03:17:36.040 --> 03:17:41.480
the most banal place on earth, and you see, I think one of the articles said they couldn't

03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:45.080
believe how big the onions were or something like that. And you're seeing this and you're seeing

03:17:45.080 --> 03:17:49.400
these janitors, school teachers, these aren't dignitaries. And they're regular people just

03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:54.600
picking whatever they want. And you're just like, it's like the equivalent of having a stroke.

03:17:55.560 --> 03:18:00.040
Yeah, I do think that that's one of the most powerful things is the grocery store.

03:18:01.400 --> 03:18:04.680
In terms of drawing a distinction between the two systems.

03:18:05.640 --> 03:18:12.120
Because you can show off technology and so on, but you can kind of sign right off technologies

03:18:12.120 --> 03:18:17.320
like, okay, that's the mechanism of the devil. But when you look at just

03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:26.680
this fruit and veggies and like very big fruit and veggies and like, yeah, and fruit in particular,

03:18:26.680 --> 03:18:30.920
like certain kinds of fruit that are just not available in Russia. I mean, it's yeah,

03:18:30.920 --> 03:18:34.120
that really shows. Wait a minute. Yeah.

03:18:37.400 --> 03:18:44.280
It's interesting, like when you're older and you have to face the reality that what you believe

03:18:44.360 --> 03:18:48.440
to be true, that your whole life has been based on a set of lies.

03:18:49.960 --> 03:18:56.440
Not mistakes, not like a little bit, like blatant lies from top to bottom start to finish.

03:18:57.000 --> 03:19:01.800
I don't know what that's like. How much you've, you start the book,

03:19:01.800 --> 03:19:09.880
I think you start the book with Ayn Rand. Yes. Yes. Yes. As one does. So before the revolution,

03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:17.000
she was born in Russia. She witnessed the revolution and moved to the United States

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:25.560
in the 2026. I remember like it was yesterday. Anyway, you write that she spent a lot of her

03:19:25.560 --> 03:19:32.040
life trying to convince Americans and the world that the negative effects of totalitarian government,

03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:39.080
just maybe using her as an example, but also this question, can we draw a distinction between

03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:44.600
authoritarian regimes and communism? Is it possible to steal man the case that

03:19:44.600 --> 03:19:49.000
not all implementations of socialism and communism would lead to the atrocities

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:55.800
we've seen in the Soviet Union and in China under Mao? Like when you, in studying all of this,

03:19:55.800 --> 03:20:02.360
how much blame do you put on the ideologies on the Marxist ideologies versus the particular

03:20:02.360 --> 03:20:07.800
leaders and dictators? Well, you have to blame the leaders a lot because they had different leaders

03:20:07.800 --> 03:20:14.040
in different countries were different from each other. Duček, who took over Czechoslovakia and he

03:20:14.040 --> 03:20:19.400
tried to introduce socialism with the human face in the Prague Spring of 1968. He was like, all

03:20:19.400 --> 03:20:23.720
right, we got to do away with this authoritarianism. We got to have more free speech. He was thinking

03:20:23.720 --> 03:20:28.760
of introducing elements of democracy. Now then the Russians sent in the tanks, but the point is he

03:20:28.760 --> 03:20:33.800
certainly was someone who was like, all right, this has got to stop. This is just absolutely crazy.

03:20:34.760 --> 03:20:45.560
Khrushchev and Stalin were not the same animal at all. I think the problem with communism in the

03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:50.440
Marxist sense is that you're going to have an introducing element of authoritarianism simply

03:20:50.440 --> 03:20:57.320
because you can't have economic planning. If I don't have a price mechanism, price is what

03:20:57.400 --> 03:21:04.040
is me knowing as a consumer or a producer what should be produced or what there's a shortage of.

03:21:04.040 --> 03:21:07.880
As prices increase, that's a signal that we have a shortage here. As prices decrease,

03:21:07.880 --> 03:21:12.120
that means that there's a surplus here. But if I'm setting the price, I don't really know

03:21:12.680 --> 03:21:16.040
how much weed I need to produce if I'm compared to corn, as compared to shoes,

03:21:16.040 --> 03:21:22.360
as compared to Santa costumes. So that is a big problem. The other issue is if you have one

03:21:23.160 --> 03:21:29.240
agency, the government, having a monopoly on let's suppose the news, like you were talking

03:21:29.240 --> 03:21:34.840
about earlier with Twitter, it's going to be really hard to have any kind of objective discourse

03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:40.120
because everyone is going to be working for the same organization. That is going to cause a

03:21:40.120 --> 03:21:45.400
problem in terms of having a feedback mechanism, even in the best scenario in terms of this is a

03:21:45.400 --> 03:21:50.600
problem, this isn't a problem. And when you have a monopoly, which is what a government is,

03:21:50.600 --> 03:21:54.520
I think people are very familiar with what the problems happen with monopoly. There's a lack of

03:21:54.520 --> 03:22:00.520
accountability, bureaucracies are faceless and then no one's to blame, and yet everyone kind of

03:22:00.520 --> 03:22:06.760
suffers as a consequence. So it doesn't necessarily have to be as authoritarian as Stalinism,

03:22:07.320 --> 03:22:14.040
but you can't have a government which is authority by its nature be this pervasive

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:20.440
without a strong amount of oppression. And same thing with, even if you just have like,

03:22:20.440 --> 03:22:24.680
let's suppose socialized healthcare, you're going to have to make it illegal for doctors to practice

03:22:24.680 --> 03:22:29.080
privately, you're going to have to have rationing, so on and so forth. Now that might be a price that

03:22:29.080 --> 03:22:33.320
people are willing to pay because you can't have infinite spending on healthcare, right?

03:22:33.320 --> 03:22:37.960
So something's going to have to give somewhere. So there is an element of authoritarianism there

03:22:37.960 --> 03:22:42.040
and people are comfortable with that and I can art my head around it. But if you're going to have

03:22:42.760 --> 03:22:47.960
one organization running literally everything in society, I don't see how you do that and

03:22:47.960 --> 03:22:53.480
have any measure of liberalism. Why do you think Iran had so much trouble

03:22:55.720 --> 03:23:01.960
telling people the danger of Soviet Stalinism?

03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:10.360
Well, I think a more pertinent question is why did Emma Goldman and Alexander

03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:13.720
Berkman have so much problems? So they were hardcore.

03:23:13.720 --> 03:23:14.760
These are anarchists.

03:23:14.760 --> 03:23:21.080
Yeah, they're Emma Goldman's on the cover. They were deported from the US. J. Edgar Hoover saw

03:23:21.080 --> 03:23:27.320
them off at Ellis Island. They were sent to Russia. They were bloodthirsty revolutionaries. They had

03:23:27.320 --> 03:23:32.200
no shortage advocating violence when necessary. And when they went there, they were just like,

03:23:32.200 --> 03:23:36.440
this is a complete nightmare. They both individually had meetings with Lenin complaining about

03:23:36.440 --> 03:23:39.720
political prisoners, complaining about lack of free speech. He told them, you know,

03:23:39.720 --> 03:23:43.480
this is a revolutionary time. You could do that later. And when they both left,

03:23:45.160 --> 03:23:48.280
her memoir was split into two books, My Disillusionment in Russia and My

03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:53.080
Further Disillusionment in Russia. He wrote The Bolshevik Myth. And she was in England

03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:57.480
and she gave a speech and she's just like, if you guys think this is for the workers,

03:23:57.480 --> 03:24:01.880
this is the biggest lie I've ever heard. They're oppressing the workers like no capitalist has

03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:07.240
ever imagined. And as she described it, people were just shifting their seats. They were

03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:11.800
interrupting her. And when she opened her talk, she had a standing ovation. And when she was done,

03:24:11.800 --> 03:24:16.840
you could hear a pin drop. So, they didn't want to hear it because this was this kind of,

03:24:16.840 --> 03:24:21.320
and Eugene Lyons talks about it later. This was like the guinea pig theory of the Russian people.

03:24:21.320 --> 03:24:26.760
Like, we're going to experiment on them over there. If it works, great. We're right. If it's wrong,

03:24:26.760 --> 03:24:30.600
it's their problem. And sure, these animals squeal, but they're beneath us. And of course,

03:24:30.600 --> 03:24:34.120
they're going to make some noise. But, you know, this is a noble experiment, but they're

03:24:34.120 --> 03:24:41.240
experimenting on a country, several countries. So, I think an ideology like this, which appeals

03:24:41.240 --> 03:24:46.680
to intellectuals because, you know, if it works or if it's implemented, they're the ones who are gods

03:24:47.240 --> 03:24:52.520
in effect in a society. Like, their status cannot be higher. They really want this to work. Like,

03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:57.640
they want a society where they are the new aristocracy, they're the most important people.

03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:03.000
And their criticisms of America, if they had a binary worldview, if America's bad,

03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:07.320
and this is the opposite of America, then by definition, it's good. And the other binary

03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:12.840
that they bought into is, you know, the Nazis and the fascists hate the communists, and the

03:25:12.840 --> 03:25:20.360
communists, true, up to a point, hated the fascists and the Nazis. Okay, well, Hitler is evil,

03:25:20.360 --> 03:25:25.960
so this guy's against Hitler, we're with him. So, that's an argument that's still made in,

03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:29.080
you know, schools growing up when you talk about World War II where they're like,

03:25:29.080 --> 03:25:32.440
we teamed up with Stalin, and they don't really talk about Stalin being a bad guy,

03:25:32.440 --> 03:25:35.880
but it's like, you know, we worked with him to fight Hitler because Hitler was a unique evil.

03:25:35.880 --> 03:25:40.520
Now, that is certainly true that Hitler's a unique evil, but that doesn't mean or even imply

03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:46.280
that Stalin is somehow an angel or a saint. Do you think some of the lessons of history

03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:52.840
are forgotten here in our modern political discourse that are important to remember?

03:25:52.840 --> 03:25:56.680
I was so triggered because I was in the supermarket, and there was like a company

03:25:56.680 --> 03:26:01.160
that's selling Russian ice cream because it meets these high-level Soviet standards.

03:26:01.160 --> 03:26:05.160
And I'm just like, you think this is some kind of joke? You think this is some kind

03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:10.440
of kitschy punchline that you had decades of people who were taught in school to turn their

03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:14.840
parents into the police if they were hoarding grain, even if it cost them their own lives,

03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:18.440
where it was a crime to be married to someone who was an enemy of the state,

03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:23.160
where you had torture being the norm, where people were institutionalized because they

03:26:23.160 --> 03:26:28.360
were politically disadvantageous and they were called insane? Like, this isn't just like, oh,

03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:32.200
this hammer and sickle is this cool, wacky symbol. Like, the amount of blood

03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:37.800
under this symbol was just enormous. And so, yeah, I think the lesson has very much been forgotten.

03:26:37.800 --> 03:26:38.920
How did the ice cream taste?

03:26:39.560 --> 03:26:46.040
It was fine. I'm a Baskin-Robbins guy, to be honest, but Van Lewin's does some great work.

03:26:46.040 --> 03:26:48.680
Baskin-Robbins doesn't have any Soviet flavors?

03:26:49.480 --> 03:26:49.980
No.

03:26:54.760 --> 03:27:01.400
Those dark jokes. I'm going to self-publish a book of jokes.

03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:15.000
Coming out in a grocery store near you. Okay. What was the hardest part about writing this book?

03:27:15.080 --> 03:27:16.600
Spent two years writing it.

03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:22.360
So when I write books for celebrities and I was co-authoring them, I did it kind of like method

03:27:22.360 --> 03:27:27.000
acting. I tried to get into their head as much as possible to kind of speak in their voice.

03:27:28.120 --> 03:27:38.040
And when you're dealing with children being tortured, harmed, starved, and you're trying

03:27:38.040 --> 03:27:46.520
to empathize with the characters, it's hard to take. The other big part I had, like I was

03:27:46.520 --> 03:27:53.720
saying earlier, I was just very, very concerned that I told this story and that it did it justice.

03:27:53.720 --> 03:27:59.320
Because I think this is something that I still don't understand and I'm kind of angry about it,

03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:07.080
that it's fallen on me to tell this story. This isn't some minor incident that happened,

03:28:07.080 --> 03:28:15.480
some random town and pick a state. This is half the world for 70, 80 years. And the fact that

03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:20.680
this is the 80s. I mean, you and I are old enough to remember the 80s. There's a show,

03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:26.280
I remember the 80s. The fact that all these things have just kind of, we have this collective amnesia

03:28:27.400 --> 03:28:32.680
and even amnesia, I think a lot of this stuff was not known even at the time or was kind of obscured.

03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:40.760
I remember I was at the Blaze, which is a network run by Glenn Beck, and they're conservatives, and

03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:47.320
I have a lot of fun there. And I'm just sitting there and sometimes they veer off, they're like,

03:28:47.320 --> 03:28:52.600
oh, Biden's a communist. I'm like, okay, Biden's a communist. But I'm like, we talk so much about

03:28:53.560 --> 03:28:58.440
slavery and the Civil War, the atrocities. We talk about World War II and the Holocaust. I'm like,

03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:03.640
how is no one talking about this? And this can very easily be portrayed as like conservatism's

03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:08.280
big victory because Reagan and Thatcher were so instrumental in guiding this to a safe landing.

03:29:08.760 --> 03:29:12.760
And I'm like, how is no one telling this story? And then one day my brain is like, you know,

03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:18.520
you write books for a living. This is kind of your job. And I'm like, all right, but I still

03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:26.280
don't know. I still, I got to tell you, I'm kind of confused that I'm the one who has to do this

03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:33.240
because this should be 30 books like this. And this is a model to follow.

03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:41.560
Yeah. And it's also that it's such recent history, but it also kind of makes you realize that there

03:29:41.560 --> 03:29:50.600
might be other fights for progress going on right now in a world that we don't know about. So you

03:29:50.600 --> 03:29:55.320
wrote about North Korea. I don't know to what degree there could possibly be fights

03:29:56.040 --> 03:30:03.240
there for progress, but there could be, they could be boiling up in China.

03:30:03.240 --> 03:30:09.800
That could be boiling up battles for progress in other parts of the world. Russia, that could be,

03:30:11.240 --> 03:30:15.960
and in America, in America. And these are all different kinds of battles for progress.

03:30:15.960 --> 03:30:27.400
And now sometimes, sometimes I, you know, we sometimes tend to criticize these battles for

03:30:27.400 --> 03:30:34.360
progress. Like if it's on the left, we'll call it like wokeism or whatever. And we pick extreme

03:30:35.000 --> 03:30:41.400
elements of it and show how silly and ridiculous it is, not realizing it, not acknowledging that

03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:52.600
there's a more civil battle going on underneath for actual, for respecting human dignity from all,

03:30:52.600 --> 03:30:58.280
for people for all walks of life. And the same, we tend to call anybody who questions mainstream

03:30:58.280 --> 03:31:03.000
narratives, conspiracy theorists, we dismiss them immediately. And they're ultimately fighting for

03:31:03.000 --> 03:31:06.920
progress. So people who criticize Fauci and everybody else, I don't know if they're,

03:31:07.800 --> 03:31:15.320
I think they want institutions that serve the public. They're fighting for progress too.

03:31:15.320 --> 03:31:20.600
And we tend to dismiss them. Like each side tends to caricature the other. But the battle

03:31:20.600 --> 03:31:25.880
for progress is happening. And I guess that's what your, that's the hopeful message with the

03:31:25.880 --> 03:31:32.040
white pill, right? Is that there's progress being made. Somehow we're all making progress here.

03:31:32.280 --> 03:31:37.960
I think more of the hopeful message is that it's not possible that we have to lose.

03:31:38.600 --> 03:31:43.800
Like if someone tells you the straight face, you can't win, the enemy is too impressive and strong,

03:31:43.800 --> 03:31:51.000
I'm like, what are you talking about? I mean, look, this was the Soviet Union and it happened,

03:31:51.000 --> 03:31:58.040
you know, relatively quickly and relatively peacefully. I mean, again, and it wasn't because

03:31:58.840 --> 03:32:04.200
Honecker in East Germany was like, oh, I'm just going to vacate my seat. He was like sending the

03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:09.880
tanks and the military guy said no. So they wanted blood. There were plenty of people who

03:32:09.880 --> 03:32:17.320
wanted blood and would have been happy to have it. So to you, maybe if not the fall of the Soviet

03:32:17.320 --> 03:32:25.240
Union, then the fall of the Iron Curtain is a great leap of progress in the 20th century.

03:32:25.880 --> 03:32:30.360
I don't see how anyone can argue against that point with a straight face.

03:32:30.360 --> 03:32:34.440
So that gives you hope that we humanity were able to do that.

03:32:35.560 --> 03:32:43.800
Yes. And at the same time, we were told at the time, give it up, be realistic. It's utopian

03:32:43.800 --> 03:32:48.040
to think this is going anywhere, maybe in a hundred years. Look, there's a reason Chekhov

03:32:48.040 --> 03:32:52.600
was on Star Trek because the idea is even the far future, you're going to have America and you're

03:32:52.600 --> 03:32:57.240
going to have the Soviet Union. This is the reality. It was called real politic. We're going

03:32:57.240 --> 03:33:01.880
to have detente because it's this permanent stalemate. We had the Vietnam War. We got our

03:33:01.880 --> 03:33:06.360
asses kicked. Russia's not going anywhere. America's not going anywhere. We've got to learn to live

03:33:06.360 --> 03:33:12.040
with each other, blah, blah, blah. And Reagan said, you don't want to hear my strategy for the

03:33:12.040 --> 03:33:17.000
Cold War? Some people might say it's simple or even simplistic. Here it is. We win, they lose.

03:33:17.960 --> 03:33:23.560
And the people who won were the Russian people and the Ukrainian people and the Lithuanian people

03:33:23.560 --> 03:33:32.200
and the Polish people and the Romanian people especially and the Hungarian people. And there

03:33:32.200 --> 03:33:41.720
are so many moments of great joy. Just tears coming down my face because you're like in Prague when

03:33:42.040 --> 03:33:47.320
Dubček, again, who tried to liberalize in 1968 and then when they sent the tanks, they deported

03:33:47.320 --> 03:33:52.280
him to Slovakia somewhere to do some forestry job. He appears in their big squares just waving from

03:33:52.280 --> 03:34:00.360
the balcony like this ghost from 20 years prior being like, look, the spirit of 68 is still alive

03:34:00.360 --> 03:34:05.800
here in Czechoslovakia. And it was like a matter of weeks. The entire government resigned and then

03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:13.880
they liberalized. It's just so many things about just overnight, just change for the profound

03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:23.400
better. And people are so committed to making sure you don't have hope and if things get better,

03:34:23.400 --> 03:34:26.120
oh, it doesn't really matter because the broader picture never gets better.

03:34:26.120 --> 03:34:31.720
And there's lots of data to the contrary where that's happened before. And this isn't some magical

03:34:31.720 --> 03:34:36.520
faraway place. This is the opposite of magical faraway place. It's Eastern Europe.

03:34:37.320 --> 03:34:45.080
And to me, I think one such narrative that people assume will always be true or just to a degree

03:34:45.080 --> 03:34:51.480
will always be true like in American politics is the extreme levels of division. And it seems to me

03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:59.160
like that too we can overcome. So the division in American politics that seems to be counterproductive,

03:34:59.160 --> 03:35:08.200
I think that can be overcome. And I think the division in geopolitics currently with Russia,

03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:15.000
China and the United States, particularly China and the United States can be overcome.

03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:24.760
And I think that requires great leadership that galvanizes the populace to the better

03:35:24.760 --> 03:35:29.480
angels of their nature. I have hope for that. People have become really cynical on social

03:35:29.480 --> 03:35:34.600
media and elsewhere in the way they talk. The liberals are destroying this country.

03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:40.520
The conservatives are destroying this country. This kind of language is becoming more and more

03:35:40.520 --> 03:35:52.360
popular. I have hope that that's temporary. At least that's my white pill. I don't know if

03:35:52.360 --> 03:35:59.400
you have that kind of hope for it. What does hope look like for you in American politics?

03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:03.240
Forget American politics. The nation, the country, the people.

03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:21.000
My hope, which I don't think is an unrealistic one, is that the next generation has a better life

03:36:21.800 --> 03:36:31.160
than you and I have had in this country. And I think anyone who thinks that America is over

03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:39.400
or is one president away from being destroyed cannot in good conscience call themselves

03:36:39.400 --> 03:36:46.760
a patriot. Because if you think America is so weak that it takes a Biden or a Trump

03:36:47.400 --> 03:36:52.120
or an Obama to irrevocably destroy it, then it's already a wrap.

03:36:53.480 --> 03:36:58.360
And I think that's just absolutely ridiculous. If you look what this country has survived,

03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:05.240
Great Depression, World War II, the Civil War. I mean, my God. So we've been through worse before.

03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:15.240
It wasn't always easy. Certainly not. But it's so hard for me as someone who's a hopeful person,

03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:20.040
not by my nature. I'm not Michael Kindness who does work for Random House, or at least he did

03:37:20.040 --> 03:37:27.480
that last time I talked to him. The thing is when you speak positively, it sounds corny.

03:37:27.480 --> 03:37:30.360
That's how screwed up our cynical culture is. Have you seen my Twitter?

03:37:32.680 --> 03:37:38.760
You're verified now. So that's good. But even something like Etsy. You couldn't go on Etsy.

03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:44.360
I paid $80 for that verification. I earned it.

03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:50.040
It's an opportunity for independent artists to create something special and cool. And I've

03:37:50.040 --> 03:37:53.640
bought a lot of stuff from them. That in and of itself is something that's pretty awesome.

03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:57.400
I'm into shaving soaps, right? Of course you are.

03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:03.800
The point is there's like dozens of artisans. Every day when you have a shave, it brings you

03:38:05.000 --> 03:38:11.240
some joy. So there's just so many things that are wonderful. And I know there's people listening

03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:16.680
to this, rolling their eyes. How can you talk about shaving soaps when my daughter,

03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:22.360
or when my wife, or when blah, blah, blah, and I'm not disparaging or dismissing what you're

03:38:22.360 --> 03:38:29.880
regarding as a problem. My point is hope means the belief that it's not at all a certainty

03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:33.240
that this problem will be insurmountable. That's all it means.

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:40.600
What do you look forward to in 2023? Since this is a holiday special.

03:38:42.200 --> 03:38:53.160
Honestly, I look forward to a lot of young people realizing that they still have lots of opportunity

03:38:53.160 --> 03:39:00.200
in this country and taking control of their own selves and realizing they can be a better person

03:39:00.200 --> 03:39:05.240
tomorrow than they are today. That the entirety of their identity is not a function of a culture

03:39:05.240 --> 03:39:10.760
which they may not identify with or like or think is deplorable.

03:39:10.760 --> 03:39:16.760
And realize, you know what? I have it in me to improve and find joy and happiness. And also

03:39:16.760 --> 03:39:23.960
the fact that that is so compelling and contagious. That is what I would want in 2023.

03:39:23.960 --> 03:39:25.640
And also for New York to get nuked.

03:39:28.360 --> 03:39:30.680
So those two things could be accomplished.

03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:33.320
Can I go back and switch the order? Because I think New York won.

03:39:33.320 --> 03:39:42.440
Oh, the jokes, the jokes. And one day friends, if you work hard enough and believe in yourself.

03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:44.280
You too can nuke New York.

03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:58.360
No, you too can spend your days dressing up. Grown men dressing up in a Santa outfit

03:39:59.240 --> 03:40:05.640
and putting on lipstick and having hours upon hours of conversation with each other and loving

03:40:05.640 --> 03:40:11.480
every second. Thank you for writing this really, really important book. Please buy The White Pill.

03:40:11.480 --> 03:40:12.280
I love you, brother.

03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:13.000
I love you too.

03:40:14.120 --> 03:40:17.800
