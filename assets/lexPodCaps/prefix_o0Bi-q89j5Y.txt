00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
slaves produce a surplus which the master gets, serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets,

00:06.880 --> 00:16.000
employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative

00:16.000 --> 00:26.240
class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another

00:26.240 --> 00:34.720
group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,

00:34.720 --> 00:41.280
resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.

00:43.680 --> 00:49.440
The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and

00:49.440 --> 00:56.480
philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic, in general and for me personally,

00:56.480 --> 01:03.840
given my family history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today, the words Marxism,

01:03.840 --> 01:11.600
socialism, and communism are used to attack and to divide, much more than to understand and to learn.

01:13.040 --> 01:19.280
With this podcast, I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx,

01:19.760 --> 01:24.800
as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.

01:25.520 --> 01:30.960
And in general, we need to both steel man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,

01:31.840 --> 01:39.040
and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant and at

01:39.040 --> 01:46.320
times dangerous. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in

01:46.320 --> 01:51.120
the description. And now, dear friends, here's Richard Wolff.

01:52.160 --> 01:58.400
Let's start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all. What is Marxism? What are the

01:58.400 --> 02:04.320
defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?

02:04.880 --> 02:10.880
Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its

02:11.840 --> 02:22.480
founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx, but because these ideas that he put forward

02:23.520 --> 02:33.920
spread as fast as they did and as globally as they did. Literally, it's 140 years since Marx died,

02:34.640 --> 02:43.200
and in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking in every country on the Earth.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.600
If you know much about the great ideas of human history,

02:49.200 --> 02:56.800
that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.

02:57.440 --> 03:04.960
And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the Marxian

03:04.960 --> 03:12.960
ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories, and economic

03:12.960 --> 03:20.160
conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently, in different places,

03:20.160 --> 03:29.440
at different times. And therefore, Marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality of

03:29.440 --> 03:39.200
all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly 40, 50 years,

03:40.560 --> 03:48.240
Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marx himself, that's all he

03:48.240 --> 03:53.760
really did. He never wrote a book about communism, he never wrote a book really about socialism,

03:53.760 --> 04:01.600
either his comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was

04:01.600 --> 04:09.760
a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what Marxism was, more or less, in its first 40 or 50

04:09.760 --> 04:20.160
years. The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few weeks.

04:21.040 --> 04:28.640
In 1871, there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to

04:28.640 --> 04:34.560
Bismarck's Germany. And then the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working

04:34.560 --> 04:42.560
class of Paris rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the

04:42.560 --> 04:50.160
Parisian society. And Marx's people, people influenced by Marx, were very active in that

04:50.160 --> 04:55.120
commune, in the leadership of the commune. And Marx wasn't that far away, he was in London.

04:56.320 --> 05:02.000
These things were happening in Paris, you know, that's an easy transport even then. And for a

05:02.000 --> 05:11.120
short time, very short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of

05:11.120 --> 05:20.560
capitalism, it became a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been

05:20.560 --> 05:26.960
implicit, now it became explicit. What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do?

05:27.760 --> 05:34.400
And why? And in what order? In other words, governing, organizing a society.

05:34.400 --> 05:41.440
But since it only lasted a few weeks, the French army regrouped. And under the leadership of people

05:41.440 --> 05:48.800
who were very opposed to Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of

05:49.840 --> 05:56.560
the communards, as they were called, and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of

05:56.560 --> 06:03.920
the French Empire at the time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have

06:04.480 --> 06:15.360
a group of Marxists, Lenin, Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment.

06:15.360 --> 06:24.000
Once again, a war, like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad

06:24.000 --> 06:31.120
reputation because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,

06:31.760 --> 06:38.400
Brest-Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses, and the army revolts. And in that

06:38.400 --> 06:46.240
situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party,

06:47.040 --> 06:56.400
splits under the pressures of all of this into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin,

06:56.400 --> 07:00.720
Trotsky, and the others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short,

07:00.720 --> 07:09.600
he's in exile. Lenin's position gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be

07:10.560 --> 07:16.640
killing German workers. This is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into

07:16.640 --> 07:23.600
colonies, and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing.

07:23.600 --> 07:29.760
As you can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States,

07:29.760 --> 07:36.000
the comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no

07:36.080 --> 07:41.760
Communist Party at this point. That comes later. The head of the Socialist Party, a very important

07:41.760 --> 07:49.440
American figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument that Americans should

07:49.440 --> 07:55.360
not fight in the war. He has nothing to do with Lenin. I don't even know if they knew of each

07:55.360 --> 08:01.840
other, but he does it on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the

08:01.840 --> 08:06.880
way, he runs for president from jail and does very well. Really very well. Remarkable.

08:08.400 --> 08:15.920
He's the inspiration for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage

08:16.480 --> 08:20.560
politically than Bernie has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link

08:20.560 --> 08:26.400
maybe later. History rhymes. Yes, the complicated story. Anyway,

08:26.400 --> 08:35.040
the importance in terms of Marxism is that now this seizure of power by a group of Marxists,

08:35.600 --> 08:40.960
that is a group of people inspired by Marx, developing what you might call a Russian,

08:42.000 --> 08:46.560
even though there were differences among the Russians too, but a Russian interpretation,

08:47.280 --> 08:55.360
this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least. What are you

08:55.360 --> 09:03.360
going to do in the Soviet Union? A lot of this was then trial and error. Marx never laid any of

09:03.360 --> 09:09.520
this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had because it was 50 years earlier

09:09.520 --> 09:16.880
in another country, etc. What begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then more later

09:16.880 --> 09:23.920
in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifurcation.

09:24.720 --> 09:34.400
Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set,

09:34.400 --> 09:41.360
and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative post-capitalist

09:41.360 --> 09:47.600
society ought to look like, how it ought to work. And there's lots of disagreement about it,

09:48.160 --> 09:54.720
lots of confusion, and I would say that that's still where it is. You have a tradition now

09:55.280 --> 10:01.760
that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,

10:01.760 --> 10:07.760
and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,

10:07.760 --> 10:14.800
that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society

10:15.600 --> 10:18.800
can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.680
And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.180
Fine.

10:25.280 --> 10:31.520
So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back, what do you think

10:31.520 --> 10:38.240
Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas of Marxism throughout

10:38.240 --> 10:47.680
the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit? Would he shake his

10:47.680 --> 10:53.600
head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementation? How do you think he would analyze

10:53.600 --> 10:57.520
it? Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if he had a chance to take a look at his

10:57.520 --> 11:03.200
writing, but he had an extraordinary sense of humor. My guess is he would deploy his humor in

11:03.200 --> 11:09.040
answering this question, too. He would say some of them are inspiring, some of the interpretations

11:09.040 --> 11:15.680
of his work, and he's very pleased with those. Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he

11:15.680 --> 11:22.880
could erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.

11:24.400 --> 11:29.920
There's a German word—I don't know if you speak the other languages—there's a wonderful German

11:29.920 --> 11:36.880
word called verzichte. It's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse something,

11:36.880 --> 11:44.960
but with real strong emphasis. Verzichte darauf is a German way of saying, I don't want anything to

11:44.960 --> 11:50.480
do with that. He would talk then in philosophical terms, because remember he was a student of

11:50.480 --> 11:56.800
philosophy. He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest.

11:56.800 --> 12:04.560
He would wax philosophical and say that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having a child.

12:04.560 --> 12:11.200
You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or her own

12:11.200 --> 12:18.400
way. These ideas, once they're out there, go their own way. As you said, there's a particular way

12:18.400 --> 12:22.880
that this idea spread. The speed at which it spread throughout the world made it even less

12:23.600 --> 12:29.600
able to be stabilized and connected back to the origins of where the idea came from.

12:30.400 --> 12:35.520
The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians after the Revolution,

12:35.520 --> 12:41.840
because they occupied a position for a while—not very long—but they occupied a position for a while

12:41.840 --> 12:48.480
in which it was exalted. There had been all these people criticizing capitalism for a long time,

12:48.480 --> 12:54.880
even the Marxists ever since mid-century. These were the first guys who pulled it off.

12:55.520 --> 13:01.920
They made it. There was a kind of presumption around the world that their interpretation must

13:01.920 --> 13:11.680
be kind of the right one, because look, they did it. For a while, they could enunciate their

13:11.680 --> 13:19.680
interpretation, and it came to be widely grasped as something which, by the way, gets called in

13:19.680 --> 13:25.840
the literature, official Marxism. The very idea that you would put that adjective in front of

13:25.840 --> 13:32.960
Marxism or Soviet Marxism or Russian Marxism, there were these words where the adjective was

13:32.960 --> 13:40.080
meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the canon. You can depart from it, but this is the canon.

13:40.080 --> 13:47.840
Before the Russian Revolution, there was no such thing, and by the 1960s, it was already

13:48.880 --> 13:57.680
gone. But for a short time, 30, 40 years, it was a kind of—and the irony is, particularly here in

13:57.680 --> 14:03.280
the United States, where the taboo against Marxism kicks in right after World War II,

14:04.240 --> 14:10.720
is so total in this country that I, for example, through most of my adult life,

14:11.360 --> 14:19.360
have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to American audiences

14:20.240 --> 14:29.360
that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the canon before

14:29.360 --> 14:37.440
1917 and hasn't been since at least the 1960s, but they don't know. It's not that they're stupid,

14:37.440 --> 14:41.760
and it's not that they're ignorant. It's that—well, the ignorance may be, but, I mean,

14:41.760 --> 14:49.760
it's not a mental problem. It's the taboo shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way,

14:49.760 --> 14:55.440
recaptures what went before and develops it in a new direction, they just don't know.

14:56.320 --> 15:03.200
Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians,

15:04.240 --> 15:08.960
the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century made a serious attempt at saying,

15:08.960 --> 15:13.360
okay, beyond the critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this?

15:13.360 --> 15:20.880
And so in that sense, not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it's interesting to look at those

15:20.880 --> 15:26.560
particular schools. Maybe— Right, because, for example, let me just take your point one step

15:26.560 --> 15:31.600
further. You really cannot understand the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Revolution,

15:32.720 --> 15:41.200
Vietnamese, and the others, because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it,

15:41.200 --> 15:48.480
to the way the Soviets did it. Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes and no is the answer.

15:48.480 --> 15:54.080
This we will do that way, but that we're not going to do. And the differences are huge,

15:54.720 --> 16:00.320
but you could find a thread—I can do that for you if you want—in which all of them are, in a way,

16:00.960 --> 16:08.960
reacting. To the originals. Yes, very much so. Like maybe most of rock music is reacting to the

16:08.960 --> 16:14.720
Beatles and the Stones. There's something like that. Can you speak to the unique elements of

16:14.720 --> 16:21.520
the various schools of that Soviet Marxism? So we've got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism,

16:21.520 --> 16:28.720
maybe even let's expand out to Maoism. So maybe I could speak to sort of Leninism,

16:30.240 --> 16:37.760
and then please tell me if I'm saying dumb things. I think for Lenin, there was an idea that there

16:37.760 --> 16:46.640
could be a small sort of vanguard party, like a small controlling entity that's wise and is able

16:46.640 --> 16:54.640
to do the central planning decisions. Then for Stalinism, one interesting—Stalin's implementation

16:54.640 --> 17:00.320
of all of this—one interesting characteristic is to move away from the international aspect

17:00.960 --> 17:07.760
of the ideal of Marxism to make it all about nation, nationalism, the strength of nation.

17:09.600 --> 17:16.160
So Maoism is different in that it's focused on agriculture, on rural.

17:17.840 --> 17:25.120
And then Trotskyism, I don't know, except that it's anti-Stalin. I don't even know if there's

17:25.120 --> 17:29.600
unique sort of philosophical elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those or something

17:29.600 --> 17:35.520
else speak to different unique elements that are interesting to think about implementation

17:35.520 --> 17:40.400
of Marxism in the real world? Probably the best way to get into this

17:41.360 --> 17:48.560
is to describe something that happened in Marxism that then shapes the answer to your question.

17:48.560 --> 17:57.440
In the early days of Marx's writings—and you know, his life spans the 19th century. He's born

17:57.440 --> 18:06.640
in 1818, dies in 1883. So literally, he lives the 19th century. And you might—I mean, to make things

18:06.640 --> 18:12.240
simple—you might look at the first half of the first two-thirds of his life as overwhelmingly

18:12.400 --> 18:20.880
gathering together the precursors to his own work. Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that—partly

18:20.880 --> 18:26.480
because he didn't work a regular job and partly because he was an exile in London most of his adult

18:26.480 --> 18:32.720
life—he worked in the library. I mean, he had a lot of time. He got subsidized a little bit by

18:32.720 --> 18:40.400
Engels, whose family were manufacturers. And you might say the first half to two-thirds of his life

18:40.400 --> 18:49.520
are about the critique of capitalism. And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his

18:49.520 --> 18:56.640
work—Western Europe, more or less—was interested in. That's what they wanted. And he gave that to

18:56.640 --> 19:05.200
them. He wasn't the only one, but he was very, very effective at it. By the last third of his life,

19:05.600 --> 19:13.920
he and the other producers of an anti-capitalist movement—people like the Chartists in England,

19:13.920 --> 19:22.160
that's a whole other movement, the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France,

19:22.160 --> 19:29.920
or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on—you put all these together, and there was a shift

19:30.480 --> 19:42.640
in what the audience—let's call it a mixture of militant working-class people on the one hand

19:43.200 --> 19:49.120
and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.

19:49.120 --> 19:56.560
They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would

19:56.560 --> 20:03.920
like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore, should we? Why

20:03.920 --> 20:09.840
should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point, the system has to be

20:09.840 --> 20:16.160
fundamentally changed. But they didn't go—you might imagine—they didn't go and say, well,

20:16.160 --> 20:21.520
what will that new system look like? They didn't go that way. What they did was ask the question,

20:22.080 --> 20:31.200
how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have captured people's minds,

20:31.200 --> 20:39.440
people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became—this was already

20:39.440 --> 20:46.640
by the last third of the 19th century—the question of the agency, the mechanism whereby

20:46.640 --> 20:55.200
we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused on seizing the

20:55.200 --> 21:01.440
government. See, before that, it wasn't that the government was not a major interest. If you read

21:02.320 --> 21:08.080
Marx's Capital, the great work of his maturity, three volumes, there's almost nothing in the

21:08.080 --> 21:13.520
state. He mentions it, but he's interested in the details of how capitalism works,

21:14.320 --> 21:21.200
factory by factory, store by store, office. What's the structure? The government's secondary for him.

21:21.200 --> 21:26.000
But there's also humans within that capitalist system of there's the working class.

21:26.000 --> 21:33.440
Right. That's what he's interested in. Think of it almost mechanically like the workplace.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.680
In the workplace, there are some people who do this and other people who do that,

21:37.760 --> 21:44.400
and they accept this division of authority, and they accept this division of what's going on here,

21:44.400 --> 21:50.960
particularly because he believed that the core economic objective of capitalism was to maximize

21:50.960 --> 21:57.520
something called profit, which his analysis located right there in the workings of the

21:57.520 --> 22:03.680
enterprise. The government was not the key factor here. And he was looking at ideas of value,

22:04.640 --> 22:12.080
how much value does the labor of the individual workers provide, and that means

22:12.880 --> 22:16.880
how do we reward the workers in an ethical way. So those are the questions.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.560
But the government is not part of that picture.

22:23.200 --> 22:28.880
So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this

22:28.960 --> 22:35.840
begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate among Marxists

22:36.720 --> 22:43.600
about the role of the state. They all agree, nearly all of them agree, that you have to get

22:43.600 --> 22:50.480
the state. The working class has to get the state because they see the state as the

22:51.600 --> 22:56.720
ultimate guarantor of capitalism. When things get really out of hand,

22:56.720 --> 23:03.600
the capitalist calls the police, or he calls the army, or both of them. And so the government

23:03.600 --> 23:12.960
is, in a sense, this key institution captured in Marxist language by the bourgeoisie, by the

23:12.960 --> 23:21.280
other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of suffrage. If suffrage is universal,

23:21.280 --> 23:28.080
or nearly so. If everybody gets a vote, which in a way capitalism brings to bear,

23:28.080 --> 23:35.040
part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution is to create a place where

23:35.040 --> 23:43.520
elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage creates the notion, aha,

23:44.320 --> 23:50.400
here's how we're going to, we have to seize the state. And then that gets agreed upon,

23:50.400 --> 23:57.200
but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says you go with the election. You

23:57.200 --> 24:04.480
mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism. And the other side

24:04.480 --> 24:11.120
is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged.

24:11.920 --> 24:18.880
You can't get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate parliaments. They buy the

24:18.960 --> 24:24.960
politicians and all that. And therefore, revolution is going to be the way to do it.

24:24.960 --> 24:32.160
Revolution gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way. They didn't do,

24:32.160 --> 24:39.440
I mean, they fought in the Duma, in the parliament, but they didn't. And this focus on the state,

24:39.440 --> 24:47.520
I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time, and if you're interested in the great

24:47.520 --> 24:55.280
names, there was a great theorist of the role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power

24:56.160 --> 25:04.480
in Germany named Edward Bernstein, very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautsky and

25:04.480 --> 25:11.920
Rosa Luxemburg, two other huge figures in Marxism at the time. And they wrote the articles that

25:11.920 --> 25:17.200
everybody reads, but it was a much broader debate. And by the way, that debate still goes on.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.280
Reformism versus revolution?

25:20.080 --> 25:26.240
And in terms, not all that different. I mean, it's adjusted to history, but in terms of different.

25:26.240 --> 25:32.720
Can you comment on where you lean in terms of the mechanism of progress,

25:33.440 --> 25:34.800
reformation versus revolution?

25:34.800 --> 25:40.080
I'd rather tell you the historical story. Over and over and over again, in most cases,

25:40.640 --> 25:46.640
the reformists have always won. Because revolution is frightening, is scary, is dangerous.

25:48.480 --> 25:53.200
And so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant discussion,

25:53.200 --> 26:00.000
not an abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.

26:02.480 --> 26:07.200
I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the 1930s,

26:07.760 --> 26:14.240
you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States, the greatest shift to the left in

26:14.240 --> 26:23.360
the country's history, before or since. Nothing like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing

26:24.000 --> 26:31.280
composed of the labor movement, which went crazy in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions

26:31.280 --> 26:38.240
in the 1930s than at any time before or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time,

26:38.240 --> 26:44.320
the explosion of two socialist parties and the communist party that became very powerful,

26:44.320 --> 26:51.200
and they all worked together, creating a very powerful leftist presence in this country.

26:51.760 --> 26:59.360
They debated in a strategically real way, reform or revolution. The reformers were the union people,

26:59.360 --> 27:04.880
by and large, and the communists were the revolutionaries, by and large, because they

27:04.880 --> 27:10.720
were affiliated with the Communist International, with Russia, and all of that. And in between,

27:10.720 --> 27:17.120
you might say, the two socialist parties, one that was Trotskyist in inspiration, and the other one,

27:17.120 --> 27:24.240
more moderate Western European kind of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended

27:24.240 --> 27:30.880
up, the reformists won that debate. There was no revolution in the 1930s here, but there was

27:31.760 --> 27:38.160
a reform that achieved unspeakably great successes, which is why it was as strong

27:38.160 --> 27:43.760
and remains as strong as it does, because it achieved in a few years in the 1930s,

27:43.760 --> 27:49.600
starting around 1932-3, social security in this country. We had never had that before.

27:49.600 --> 27:54.560
That's the same one we have now. Unemployment insurance never existed before,

27:54.560 --> 28:01.120
that you have till today. Minimum wage for the first time, still have that today. And a federal

28:01.120 --> 28:07.840
program of employment that hired 15 million people. I mean, these were unspeakable gifts,

28:07.840 --> 28:11.120
if you like, to the working class. So that's the 30s and the 40s.

28:11.120 --> 28:18.560
30s, not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by taxes

28:18.560 --> 28:24.160
on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the corporation,

28:24.160 --> 28:32.160
the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans, because it has been erased from

28:32.160 --> 28:37.680
consciousness. We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the

28:37.680 --> 28:43.920
20th century with the Russians. Right, with the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.

28:44.080 --> 28:49.040
Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries.

28:49.040 --> 28:57.520
We seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state, and socialism is when the working class

28:58.240 --> 29:05.040
captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses its power over the state

29:05.040 --> 29:10.480
to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're going toward.

29:11.440 --> 29:16.720
And again, make a long story short, in the interest of time, what happens, which is not unusual in

29:16.720 --> 29:24.880
human history, is that the means becomes the end. In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear,

29:24.880 --> 29:30.000
before he died, you know, he doesn't live very long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from

29:30.000 --> 29:34.240
17, he's dated 22. By that time, he has his brain trouble.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.280
1923, by the way, not at age 23.

29:37.280 --> 29:43.840
Yeah, 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years. He's very clear. He even says,

29:43.840 --> 29:49.200
and I've done work on that, I've published, so I know this stuff. He says in a famous speech,

29:49.200 --> 29:56.160
let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state, but we don't have socialism. We have to

29:56.160 --> 30:01.760
create that. We have to move towards that. We have to move towards that. We have to move towards

30:01.760 --> 30:10.000
that. We have to create that. We have to move towards that. With Stalin, you know, Lenin dies

30:10.000 --> 30:14.880
and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky loses the fight, he's exiled, he goes to

30:14.880 --> 30:21.440
Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power, does all the things he's famous or infamous for.

30:23.120 --> 30:30.400
And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a decision. I mean, not that he makes it alone,

30:30.640 --> 30:36.720
things have evolved in Russia so that they do the following. They declare that they are

30:37.440 --> 30:44.240
socialism. In other words, socialism becomes when you capture the state,

30:44.960 --> 30:52.720
not when the state capture has enabled you to do x, y, z, other things. No, no. The state itself,

30:53.360 --> 30:59.760
once you have it, is socialism. So when a socialist captures the state, that's socialism.

30:59.760 --> 31:02.800
Exactly. That's exactly right.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.640
I feel like that's definitionally confusing.

31:06.640 --> 31:11.600
Well, it shouldn't be because I'm giving you an example. If you go to many parts of the United

31:11.600 --> 31:18.320
States today and you ask people what socialism, they'll look you right in the face and they'll

31:18.320 --> 31:26.560
say the post office. When I first heard this as a young man, you know, what? The post office.

31:27.200 --> 31:34.560
It took me a while to understand the post office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the

31:34.560 --> 31:43.600
United States where the government runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the

31:43.600 --> 31:50.880
government doesn't run it. If a private individual who's not a government official runs it, well,

31:50.880 --> 31:56.000
then it's capitalism. If the government takes it, then it's socialism.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.640
So what is wrong with that reasoning? So the idea, I think...

32:01.680 --> 32:05.520
There's nothing wrong with it's a way of looking at the world. It's just got nothing to do with

32:05.520 --> 32:12.160
Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to pull this apart. So what role

32:14.480 --> 32:24.080
does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned with this class struggle

32:24.240 --> 32:32.720
with respecting the working class. What is the connection between that struggle and central

32:32.720 --> 32:38.560
planning that is often... Central planning is often associated with Marxism. So a centralized

32:38.560 --> 32:40.960
power doing... Russia did that.

32:40.960 --> 32:48.160
Allocation. So that has to do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet

32:48.160 --> 32:51.120
Union. It has nothing to do with Marx. How else can you do...

32:51.120 --> 32:53.440
How else can you do... I don't think you can find

32:54.400 --> 33:00.480
anywhere in Marx's writing anything about central planning or any other kind of planning.

33:00.480 --> 33:11.520
Again, fundamentally then, Marx's work has to do with factories, with workers, with the bourgeoisie,

33:12.560 --> 33:18.800
and the exploitation of the working class. But you still have to take that leap.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.680
What is beyond capitalism?

33:21.680 --> 33:25.760
Right. So maybe we should turn to that, focus on that.

33:25.760 --> 33:32.480
Okay. Yes. We've already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.600
How else can we go beyond capitalism?

33:35.600 --> 33:39.920
Let me push you a little further. They didn't succeed, in my judgment,

33:39.920 --> 33:45.280
as a Marxist. And I'm now going to tell you why they didn't succeed, because they didn't

33:46.080 --> 33:50.720
understand, as well as they could have or should have, what Marxist was trying to do.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.960
I think I would have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circumstances.

33:54.960 --> 34:00.400
This is not a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding what's going on.

34:00.400 --> 34:07.840
All right. So I'll give you an example. Most of my adult life, I have taught Marxian economics.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.000
I'm a professor of economics. I've been that all my life.

34:12.960 --> 34:19.920
I'm a graduate of American universities. As it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country

34:19.920 --> 34:27.840
passes for its best universities. It's another conversation you and I can have. So I went to

34:27.840 --> 34:34.240
Harvard, then I went to Stanford, and I finished at Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education.

34:34.960 --> 34:40.880
They tried very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League,

34:40.880 --> 34:49.120
20 semesters, one after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned

34:49.120 --> 34:57.440
a word about Marxism. That is, no critique of capitalism was offered to me, ever, with one

34:57.440 --> 35:03.760
except one professor in Stanford. In the one semester I studied with him, he gave me plenty

35:03.760 --> 35:08.960
to read, but nobody else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past,

35:08.960 --> 35:15.520
and that's very true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground

35:16.640 --> 35:23.280
intellectually through this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it.

35:24.240 --> 35:28.480
Perhaps we can discuss historically why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case.

35:28.480 --> 35:35.120
So Marxian economics, did Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of-

35:36.080 --> 35:42.800
Dismissal. He came up only as an object of dismissal. To give you an example,

35:43.520 --> 35:49.120
the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that was for many years the canonical

35:49.120 --> 35:56.720
book, it isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a professor of economics at MIT named Paul

35:56.720 --> 36:04.720
Samuelson. A whole generation or two were trained on his textbook. If you open the cover of his

36:04.720 --> 36:13.680
textbook, he has a tree. And the tree is Adam Smith and David Ricardo at the root, and then

36:13.680 --> 36:18.400
the different branches of it. He's trying to give you an idea as a student of how the thing

36:18.400 --> 36:24.880
developed. And it's a tree, and everybody on it is a bourgeois. And then there's this one little

36:24.880 --> 36:30.640
branch that goes off like this and sort of starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other

36:30.640 --> 36:36.400
words, he had to have it complete because he's not a complete faker. But beyond that, no,

36:36.400 --> 36:45.200
there was no. Nothing in the book gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's cold war.

36:45.200 --> 36:50.400
I mean, that's really neither here nor there. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the cold war

36:50.400 --> 36:56.080
in this country. My professors were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think

36:56.080 --> 37:04.400
will help. Marx was interested in the relationship of people in the process of production.

37:04.400 --> 37:09.680
He's interested in the factory, the office, the store. What goes on? And by that he means,

37:09.680 --> 37:16.320
what are the relationships among the people that come together in a workplace?

37:16.800 --> 37:27.680
And what he analyzes is that there is something going on there that has not been adequately

37:27.680 --> 37:36.560
understood and that has not been adequately addressed as an object needing transformation.

37:36.560 --> 37:43.760
What does he mean? The answer is exploitation, which he defines mathematically in the following

37:43.760 --> 37:52.560
way. Whenever in a society, any society, you organize people, adults, not the children,

37:52.560 --> 38:00.720
not the sick, but healthy adults, in the following way, a big block of them, a clear majority,

38:01.520 --> 38:07.920
work. That is, they use their brains and their muscles to transform nature. A tree into a chair,

38:08.000 --> 38:14.080
a sheep into a woolen sweater, whatever. In every human community, Marx argues,

38:14.800 --> 38:21.920
there are the people who do that work, but they always produce more chairs, more sweaters,

38:21.920 --> 38:27.600
more hamburgers than they themselves consume, whatever their standard of living. It doesn't

38:27.600 --> 38:33.200
have to be low, it could be medium, it could be high, but they always produce more than they

38:33.200 --> 38:40.160
themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he writes this, uses the German word

38:40.160 --> 38:48.880
mehr, M-E-H-R, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the more. That more got badly translated

38:48.880 --> 38:56.880
into the word surplus. Shouldn't have been, but it was. By the way, by German and English people

38:56.880 --> 39:01.680
doing the translations- What's the difference between more and surplus? Is there a nuance?

39:01.680 --> 39:08.720
Yeah, because surplus has a notion of it's discretionary, it's sort of extra. He's not

39:08.720 --> 39:12.560
taking, he's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.960
Yes, very simple. One minus the other.

39:14.960 --> 39:23.760
Yes. X minus Y. X is the total output. Y is the consumption by the producer. Therefore,

39:23.760 --> 39:29.680
X minus Y equals S, the surplus. Exactly, exactly. Now Marx argues,

39:32.080 --> 39:38.480
the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?

39:39.760 --> 39:47.600
Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it? And Marx's answer

39:47.600 --> 39:55.200
is therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. How is that organized? For example,

39:55.200 --> 40:03.440
who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting it? What's

40:03.440 --> 40:09.040
their social role? For example, here we go now. If you get this and you get the core of it anyway,

40:10.640 --> 40:15.680
and I don't charge much. The workers themselves could get it.

40:15.680 --> 40:21.680
Less than lawyers. Right, that's right. The workers themselves could get it. That's the

40:21.680 --> 40:29.760
closest Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers who produce the

40:29.760 --> 40:38.320
surplus together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets it,

40:38.320 --> 40:43.840
but more importantly, who gets to decide who gets it. Well, who gets it and who gets to decide

40:43.840 --> 40:49.520
what to do with it? Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it.

40:49.520 --> 40:57.840
So that's the logic of the word sequence. It's produced. Marx uses the word appropriated,

40:57.840 --> 41:03.760
in other words, whose property. Who gets to decide, if you like. What happens to all that

41:03.760 --> 41:09.360
property ever meant is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of

41:09.360 --> 41:14.480
communism. By the way, it's not just clean. It's the only one.

41:15.840 --> 41:19.360
Can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?

41:20.160 --> 41:27.680
Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced

41:27.680 --> 41:34.480
is taken and distributed by people other than those who produce it. Slaves produce a surplus

41:34.480 --> 41:42.000
which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus

41:42.000 --> 41:50.880
which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures,

41:50.880 --> 42:00.080
because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people,

42:00.800 --> 42:08.560
not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment,

42:08.560 --> 42:15.840
and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor,

42:15.840 --> 42:22.000
simple metaphorical story. You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park

42:22.000 --> 42:27.440
a few blocks from here. It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those

42:27.440 --> 42:33.280
men with an ice cream truck comes by. Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling, your children see the ice cream.

42:33.280 --> 42:39.520
Daddy, get me an ice cream. So you walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones,

42:39.520 --> 42:45.760
and you give them to one of the children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl,

42:46.480 --> 42:52.720
obviously. What's the issue? And you realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order

42:53.520 --> 42:58.000
the one you gave the two ice cream cones to, give one of those to your sister or your brother or

42:58.000 --> 43:05.520
whatever it is, and that's how you solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says,

43:06.400 --> 43:12.560
you know, you didn't fix it by what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place.

43:14.480 --> 43:20.640
My response, so you understand, all of the efforts to deal with inequality

43:20.640 --> 43:27.600
in economic, political, cultural, these are all giving the ice cream cone back to the kid.

43:27.600 --> 43:32.480
You should never do this in the first place. The reallocation of resources

43:32.480 --> 43:38.480
creates bitterness in the populace. Look at Arva. This country is tearing itself apart now

43:38.480 --> 43:42.560
in a way that I have never seen in my life and I've lived here all my life and I've worked here

43:42.560 --> 43:49.840
all my life. It's tearing itself apart and it's tearing itself apart basically over the

43:49.840 --> 43:56.480
redivision, the redistribution of wealth, having so badly distributed in the first,

43:56.480 --> 44:03.360
but that's all in Marx. And notice as I explained to you what is going on in this tension-filled

44:03.360 --> 44:08.800
production scene in the office, the factory, the store. I don't have to say a word about the

44:08.800 --> 44:14.240
government. I'm not interested in the government. The government's really a very secondary matter

44:14.240 --> 44:21.760
to this core question. And here comes the big point. If you make a revolution and all you do

44:22.320 --> 44:30.000
is remove the private exploiter and substitute a government official without changing the

44:30.000 --> 44:36.560
relationship, you can call yourself a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point

44:36.560 --> 44:43.360
of the Marxism. The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se.

44:43.360 --> 44:49.040
You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes all

44:49.040 --> 44:55.120
the decisions and gets the surplus vis-a-vis another one that produces it. If you do that,

44:55.120 --> 45:01.760
you will destroy the whole project. Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get,

45:01.760 --> 45:06.880
but you'll so misunderstand it that the Germans again have a phrase,

45:07.120 --> 45:13.520
get schief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project gets off the rails because it can't

45:15.360 --> 45:20.160
understand either what its objective should have been and therefore it doesn't understand

45:20.160 --> 45:26.000
how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this is not what it had hoped for.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.520
I mean, there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is,

45:29.520 --> 45:42.160
so there's human nature. To what degree does communism, a lack of exploitation of the working

45:42.160 --> 45:48.960
class naturally emerge? If you leave two people together in a room and come back a year later,

45:48.960 --> 45:53.840
if you leave five people together in a room, if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people,

45:54.480 --> 46:03.680
it seems that humans form hierarchies naturally. So the clever, the charismatic, the sexy,

46:03.680 --> 46:11.360
the muscular, the powerful, however you define that, starts becoming a leader and start to

46:12.160 --> 46:20.320
do maybe exploitation in a non-negative sense, a more generic sense, starts to become an employer

46:20.960 --> 46:25.600
not in a capitalist sense but just as a human. Here, you go do this and in exchange I will give

46:25.600 --> 46:32.160
you this. Just becomes the leadership role, right? So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice,

46:33.280 --> 46:38.000
the idea sort of of communism would be nice to not steal from the work.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.680
Nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human nature.

46:41.680 --> 46:48.320
Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human nature

46:48.320 --> 46:52.320
to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding,

46:53.360 --> 47:01.600
in no particular order. Here are some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell,

47:02.240 --> 47:11.040
is a history in which a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise

47:11.040 --> 47:22.160
and as they do, they rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially

47:22.160 --> 47:30.320
disruptive and unacceptable. The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct? Is

47:30.320 --> 47:37.280
there some human nature that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is, this has to be

47:37.280 --> 47:45.040
repressed or else we don't have a society. And Freud helps us to understand that that repression

47:45.040 --> 47:51.040
is going on all the time and it has consequences. It's not a finished project. You repress it.

47:51.040 --> 47:56.880
It's gone. It doesn't work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of people together

47:56.880 --> 48:03.360
at some point, they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to want the

48:03.920 --> 48:11.040
other person or persons to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to

48:11.040 --> 48:21.680
do that. We just don't. Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it

48:22.320 --> 48:30.000
on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every

48:30.000 --> 48:37.040
effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you

48:37.040 --> 48:43.440
endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological

48:43.440 --> 48:49.440
community that has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless

48:49.440 --> 48:55.440
documents in which the defenders of those systems, not all of them, of course, but many defenders

48:55.520 --> 49:03.600
used that argument. To naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,

49:04.480 --> 49:11.520
to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.

49:12.320 --> 49:19.280
And therefore, capitalism, since it was born, since it's been developing, we all know what

49:19.280 --> 49:25.280
the next stage of capitalism is. We can infer. The burden is on

49:25.280 --> 49:29.120
the people who think it isn't going to die. So it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're

49:29.120 --> 49:35.600
saying is if we look at history, you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against

49:35.600 --> 49:40.240
human nature because we keep using that for basically everything including toxic relationship,

49:40.240 --> 49:47.360
toxic systems, destructive systems. That said, let me just ask a million different questions.

49:48.000 --> 50:01.360
So what about the argument that the employer, the capitalist takes on risk versus the employee who's

50:01.360 --> 50:05.760
just there doing the labor? The capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk.

50:09.200 --> 50:14.480
Are they not in aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort, hiring a lot of people?

50:15.040 --> 50:18.880
Aren't they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure?

50:18.880 --> 50:25.120
So first of all, there's risk almost in everything you undertake. Any project

50:25.120 --> 50:31.200
that begins now and ends in the future takes a risk that between now and that future,

50:31.200 --> 50:37.920
something's going to happen that makes it not work out. I mean, I got into a cab before I came here

50:37.920 --> 50:43.360
today in order to do this with you. I took a risk. The cab could have been in an accident.

50:43.600 --> 50:48.000
Lightning could have hit us. A bear could have eaten my left foot. Who the hell knows?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.640
Shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took?

50:50.640 --> 50:56.320
No, hold it a second. Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it

50:56.320 --> 51:01.760
wonderful. You talk about risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk.

51:02.480 --> 51:10.960
Let's go with the worker and with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan

51:10.960 --> 51:18.640
to Pennsylvania to take that job. He made a decision to have children. They are teenagers.

51:18.640 --> 51:23.920
They're now in school at a time when their friendships are crucial to their development.

51:23.920 --> 51:29.840
You're going to yank them out of the school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk

51:30.960 --> 51:37.920
to do that job every day, to forestall all the other things he could have done.

51:37.920 --> 51:45.120
He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next month, next year. He bought a house

51:45.120 --> 51:50.800
which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he's now stuck. He has to make a monthly

51:50.800 --> 51:58.720
payment. If you make a mistake, you capitalist, he's the one who's going to—you're a capitalist.

51:58.720 --> 52:03.680
You've got a lot of money, otherwise you wouldn't be in that position. You've got a cushion.

52:03.680 --> 52:09.120
He doesn't. If you investigate, you'll see that in every business I've ever been in,

52:09.120 --> 52:12.240
and I've been involved in, a lot of them. So you think it's possible to actually measure

52:12.240 --> 52:17.440
risk or is your basic argument is there's risk involved in a lot of both the working class and

52:17.440 --> 52:23.040
the bourgeoisie, the capitalist? That's right. And the worker would never come and say,

52:23.680 --> 52:31.680
because he's been taught right, I want this payment, a wage, for the work I do.

52:32.560 --> 52:37.200
And I want this page, this payment, for the risk I take.

52:37.200 --> 52:42.320
Well, there's some level of communication like that. You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs,

52:42.320 --> 52:47.280
but that's probably built into the salary, all those kinds of things. But you're not

52:47.280 --> 52:53.120
incorporating the full spectrum of risk. You don't believe that. This country is now being

52:54.160 --> 52:59.280
literally transformed from below by an army of workers who work at Amazon,

53:00.160 --> 53:07.040
fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's killing us. We get paid shit,

53:07.760 --> 53:14.880
and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds of the defenders of capitalism

53:14.880 --> 53:21.120
between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one hand, and the wage.

53:21.120 --> 53:25.840
Let me give you just a couple of examples. This is my job. This is my life, what I do.

53:26.800 --> 53:33.520
The median income of a child care worker in the United States right now as we speak

53:34.160 --> 53:45.360
is $11.22 an hour, median. So 50% make less, 50% make more. The median income for car park

53:45.360 --> 53:53.040
attendant is several dollars per hour higher than that. What does the car park attendant do?

53:53.120 --> 54:02.000
He stares at your car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it

54:02.000 --> 54:08.800
and he moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure that I know of that makes any rational

54:08.800 --> 54:16.320
sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four-year-olds who are at the key moment of

54:16.320 --> 54:23.200
mental formation the first five years, to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who

54:23.200 --> 54:30.320
watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it. Gender explained, all kinds of issues.

54:30.960 --> 54:37.040
The car park people are males and the day the child care people are females, and that in our

54:37.040 --> 54:44.560
culture is a very big marker of what, but the one who said only the economics professor, nobody else

54:45.520 --> 54:49.520
says this stuff because in economics, I don't know if you were familiar with our profession,

54:49.520 --> 54:58.000
but we have something which we call marginal product. This is a fantasy. I was a mathematician

54:58.000 --> 55:04.320
before I became an economist. I loved mathematics. I specialized in mathematics. So I know

55:04.320 --> 55:11.120
mathematics pretty well. What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it's mathematics.

55:11.120 --> 55:20.720
It's very sophisticated. But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify

55:20.720 --> 55:28.640
the marginal product of a factor of production like a worker. In the textbook, when it's taught,

55:28.640 --> 55:33.760
I've taught this stuff. I hold my nose, but I teach it. Then I explain to students what I've

55:33.760 --> 55:38.800
just taught you is horse shit, but first I teach it. What is the marginal product, if it might be

55:38.800 --> 55:45.440
useful to say? The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the

55:45.440 --> 55:53.600
diminution of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker. Measured by? The amount

55:53.600 --> 56:01.280
of the output that diminishes. Output of the raw product, of the product. Usually in real terms,

56:01.280 --> 56:06.240
so physical, not the value. You could do a value, but it's really more the physical you're at.

56:06.640 --> 56:12.640
There is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so interesting.

56:13.600 --> 56:18.000
I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that, but I just want to get to that.

56:19.680 --> 56:26.160
Hegel, who is Marx's teacher, has a famous line. You can't step in the same river twice.

56:26.960 --> 56:32.880
The argument is you and the river have changed between the first and the second time. So it's

56:32.880 --> 56:36.720
a different you and it's a different river. You can choose not to pay attention to that.

56:37.360 --> 56:42.000
You can't claim you're not doing that. You can't claim that you can actually do that,

56:42.000 --> 56:48.720
because you can't. There is no way to do that. The meaning that you can't just remove a worker

56:48.720 --> 56:53.120
and have a clean mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the output.

56:53.120 --> 56:58.720
Because too many other things are going on, too many things are changing, and you cannot assume,

56:59.360 --> 57:07.520
much as you want to, that the outcome on the output side is uniquely determined by the change

57:07.520 --> 57:13.600
you made on the input side. You can't do that. Even in the average, it's not going to work out.

57:15.040 --> 57:20.640
Mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,

57:20.640 --> 57:26.160
Keterus Paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did.

57:27.120 --> 57:31.360
You know why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world. That's not possible.

57:31.360 --> 57:38.160
You better account for that. Otherwise, you're mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality

57:38.160 --> 57:45.040
you abstracted from to get the abstraction. As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through

57:45.040 --> 57:50.480
a thought experiment or an actual experiment of removing every single economist from the world,

57:50.480 --> 57:52.880
would we be better off or worse off? Much better off.

57:55.520 --> 57:59.680
And I'm one. I'm talking about myself. See, economics—

57:59.680 --> 58:03.920
We're going to ship all the economies to Mars and see how well it works off.

58:03.920 --> 58:11.680
But the serious part of this is that economics—it's really about capitalism.

58:11.680 --> 58:15.040
Economics as a discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing.

58:15.920 --> 58:20.800
When I teach, I teach courses at the university, for example, called History of Economic Thought.

58:22.000 --> 58:27.200
And I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato. And I say, you know, they talked about

58:27.200 --> 58:35.040
really interesting things, but they never called it economics. It made no sense to people to abstract

58:36.720 --> 58:43.840
something as central to daily life as economics broadly defined. It made no sense. That's a

58:43.840 --> 58:49.840
creation much, much later. That's capitalism that did that, created the field. So when I

58:49.840 --> 58:53.360
give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them particular passages.

58:54.240 --> 59:00.640
By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it. Plato and Aristotle talked about markets

59:00.640 --> 59:06.720
because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were beginning to intrude

59:06.720 --> 59:14.400
upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena, that we're not just producing

59:14.400 --> 59:20.080
goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid pro quo. I'll give you three oranges,

59:20.080 --> 59:27.280
you give me two shirts, a market exchange. And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets,

59:27.280 --> 59:34.640
denounced them. And for the same reason, they destroy social cohesion. They destroy community.

59:34.640 --> 59:39.440
They make some people rich and other people poor. And they set us against each other,

59:39.440 --> 59:43.680
and it's terrible. And here's what—they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on.

59:44.320 --> 59:52.160
One of them said, okay, there can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says,

59:52.160 --> 59:58.560
no, no, no, no, no, no. Too late for that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid

59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.840
of this institution that has crawled in amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:14.160
But what we can do is control it, regulate it, get from the market what it does reasonably well,

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:18.800
and prevent it from doing the destructive things it does so badly.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.200
So fundamentally, the destructive thing of a market is just the engine of capitalism. So

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:34.640
it creates exploitation of the worker, facilitates it, and it is an institution that

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:41.600
Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way, is a way of

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:47.360
thinking about it that exists right now all over the world. Look, the medieval Catholic church

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:56.240
had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury. And this was that God said,

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.960
if there's a person who needs to borrow from you, then that's a person in need. And the good

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:11.200
Christian thing to do is to help him. To demand an interest payment rather than to help your fellow

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:20.480
man is God hates you for that. That's a sin. Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:28.000
But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the intimate

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:36.080
human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able to create a system that involves thousands,

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:45.760
millions of humans. And there'd be some level of safe, self-regulating fairness.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.240
There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.000
I wonder what, so I guess- Suppose you were interested in having,

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:02.480
suppose you took us your problem. We have a set of funds that can be loaned out.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:11.040
And people don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay. To whom should they lend it?

01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.560
Well, we could say in our society, we're going to run this the way professors in institutions like

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:26.080
MIT work this. They write up a project. They send the project in to some government office

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:33.120
where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government decides we're

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:40.240
going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society. We're in

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:45.200
greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend money to

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.880
people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here because we're

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.440
going to, but instead what we do is who can pay the highest interest rate?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:03.600
Whoa, what do you do? What ethics would justify you do it? It's like a market in general.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.680
Something is in shortage. All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one basic way

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.000
to understand it. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word shortage

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:20.720
means, has no other meaning. If the demand is greater than the supply,

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.120
okay, now you've got a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:33.520
supply. You have a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:40.080
have a lot of money to bid up the price of whatever's short. That solves your problem

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.680
because as the price goes up, the poor people, they drop out. They can't buy the thing

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.360
at the exalted price. So you've got a way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:58.560
with the most money. At this point, most human beings confronted with this explanation of a

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:05.840
market would turn against it because it contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them,

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:11.920
would say, what? You know what that means? It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.040
and give it to their cat, while the poor person has no milk for their five children.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.360
There it is. Do you want a market? Why? The fundamental thing that seems unfair,

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.520
there's the resulting inequality now. Or death.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:31.280
Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality. Yes, it is.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:37.120
What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics to the sort of

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:46.240
debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats? Meaning,

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.360
if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:59.680
but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:07.840
to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.360
that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:22.480
Not looking at the individual unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined,

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.680
but just observing historically. Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:34.240
that seemed to have made life easier and better on average. What do you say to that?

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:43.680
I have several responses to that, but I do disagree fundamentally with what's going on there.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.040
But let me give you the argument so that you can hear them and then you can evaluate them,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.560
as can anybody who's listening or watching.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:06:02.160
Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's central arguments was that everything that exists

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:10.240
exists, quote, in contradiction. In simple English, there's a good and bad side, if you like,

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.840
to everything. And you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition and start looking

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.560
for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones and the bad things that are the

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.320
other side of the good ones, etc. The dialectic.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:31.520
Yes, exactly. And Marx, very attentive to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:39.520
and applies it, of course, to the central object of his research, capitalism. So this is not a

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.360
simple-minded fellow who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism as if there were nothing

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.800
that this system achieved or accomplished. And one of the things he celebrates a lot

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:59.600
is the technological dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound, because, you know,

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:07.520
he lived at the time when major breakthroughs in textile technology and mining and chemistry

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:15.280
and so on were achieved. But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:22.400
responsible for the improvement in the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people,

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:31.520
Marx now comes back and says, oh, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:41.600
has been mostly represented by capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists,

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:50.080
with very few exceptions, some, but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:57.120
lives of the mass of people. The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:04.320
that means is replace a worker with a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.720
China, bring in desperate immigrants from other parts of the world, because they will work for

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.560
less money than the folks that you have here at home. Every measure to help the standard of living

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:24.720
of American workers had to be fought for for decades over the opposition of capitalists

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:30.800
from the beginning to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was passed in the

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:36.880
middle of the 1930s, when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together,

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:44.080
they don't want, and today, just a factoid for you. The last time the minimum wage

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:50.960
was raised in the United States, federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty

01:08:50.960 --> 01:09:02.080
sum of $7.25 an hour, which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is now,

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:08.640
11, 12, 13 years since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:15.360
every year, and in the last year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up,

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:24.720
the minimum wage was never raised. What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:38.560
The nerve of the defender of capitalists, who wants now to get credit for the improvement in

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:44.000
the standard of life of the workers that was fought by every generation, you know it takes

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:51.920
your breath away. It's an argument, whoa. But I take my hat off if I had one, because that is one

01:09:51.920 --> 01:10:00.880
of the only ways to justify this system. Long ago, let me get the heart of it, long ago, capitalism

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:10.080
could have overcome hunger, could have overcome disease, could have, I mean, way beyond what we

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:19.760
have now, but it didn't. And that's the worst moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.720
that when you could, you didn't? Look, let me get at it another way,

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:33.040
because this may interest you anyway. The issue is not that capitalism isn't

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.520
technologically dynamic, it is. And along the way, it has developed things that have helped

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:48.000
people's lives get better, no question. But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:57.920
standard of living is somehow built into capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous,

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.720
and I can give you, because you do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.400
Imagine a production process in which you have

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.200
$100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.080
and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers, and he puts them all together,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.880
and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something at one of the prices,

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:35.040
and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:42.000
let's say the revenue is, it doesn't really matter, it's 120, for lack of a better word,

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.520
220, sorry, and he takes 100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.240
another 100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other 20 is his profit,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.880
and he puts that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough, a machine,

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.480
a new machine. And the new machine is so effective,

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:14.000
you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers. So you don't need to spend

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.120
100 on workers, you only need to spend 50. You can do it with half the workers. And so the capitalist

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.360
goes to the workers—by the way, this happens every day—and he says to half of them,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.280
you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning. I don't need you. It's nothing personal. I got a

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:38.880
machine. Why does he do that? Because of the 50, he now no longer has to spend on labor, because

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:44.720
don't need half of them. He keeps. Everything else is the same. The machine, everything else is

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:52.800
just to make the math easy. So he keeps as his own profit the 50 that before he paid for those

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:58.960
workers. Because when he sells it for 220, that 50 he doesn't have to give to the next job until

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:07.280
he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology leads. He's happy. He's become

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:14.640
more profitable. He's got an extra 50, which is why he buys the machine. The workers are screwed.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:20.640
Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and wife,

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.520
tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was nice enough to say,

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:31.760
it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need it. So I'm completely screwed here. I don't know

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:36.320
what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's education,

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:41.680
whatever else he's got going for himself. All right. Now, now the point. There was,

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:47.200
of course, an alternative path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers,

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:52.080
pay them exactly the same that you did before for half a day's work.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.200
You would have got the same output, same revenue, same profit as before.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:07.760
But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day of the lives

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:16.160
of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this technology,

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.920
but instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of more money.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.080
You want to support a system like this?

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:34.480
Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad. So you just listed the bad,

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:38.320
and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation of this kind of system.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:45.200
The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to ideas of what the alternative

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:50.560
might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative? So you just kind of as an

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:57.120
opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work less,

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.320
get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:11.200
interests, other interests, the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.720
basically strengthen and embolden the basic humanity that's under all of us.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:30.320
Yes, but then what cost does that have on the deadline-fueled, competition-fueled machine

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.080
of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.360
Slows it down.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:44.080
It slows it down. And the question is, which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:52.320
I agree with that. And I'd love there to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it,

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:58.080
let's debate it, and then let's decide what mixture, because it's not either or. The math

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.840
problem I gave you is either or. We could mix it. You could have a third less of a working day

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.520
instead of a half less, and then the other part would be extra profit for our employer, etc. So

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:16.960
let's have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive, and we have no such

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:23.200
thing. All of this is decided by one side in this debate, which not only we know what they do,

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.840
they always choose the one that maximizes their profit, because that's what they were told to do

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.360
in business school where I've taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision, but it's lopsided

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:42.080
to boot. So we don't have the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good Hegelian Marxists

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.440
and say, let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision that we can.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:53.360
We'll make mistakes, but we'll all make them together. It won't be one of us making a

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:59.360
dictatorial decision. You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat,

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:09.840
not as a notion of how government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:16.640
The dictatorship of these key decisions is not made by some sitting council, it's made by each

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:22.880
little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is why Marx

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:28.640
focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.960
lurk in the background what the alternative is.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.160
Yeah, let's go there.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:39.360
Okay. It goes right back to what I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:49.280
together, appropriate their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it,

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:56.160
which includes the decision of whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:05.040
to use the machine and the savings it might allow to be handled by more leisure for themselves,

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:15.120
or as a fund for new developments in technology or new products, or whatever they want.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:21.280
And you know, this is an old idea in human. Marx loved that. Towards the end of his life,

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:27.280
toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:32.240
And one of the reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:38.160
that in this society and that, including here in the United States, that there were examples

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:45.920
of people who organized their production in precisely this way, as a collective,

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:53.440
democratic community in which everybody had an equal voice. So we all together decide

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:59.920
democratically what to produce, how to produce, where to produce, and what to do with the output

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:08.720
we all helped to produce. So let's do it in, you know, in this country where democracy is a

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:17.280
a value nearly everybody subscribes to. Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.200
that there is a place in our society where democracy has never been allowed to enter.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:30.640
The workplace. In the workplace, a tiny group of people, unaccountable to the rest of them,

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:37.040
the employer, whether that's an individual, a family, a partnership, or a corporate board

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:45.280
of directors, a tiny group of people controls economically a vast mass of employees. Those

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:52.560
employees don't elect those people. There is no accountability. It is the most undemocratic

01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:02.320
arrangement imaginable. And this society insists on calling itself democratic when it has organized

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:08.240
the minor matter of producing everything in a way that isn't the direct, it's autocratic.

01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:16.320
So to push back on a few things. So one is the idea of this society calling itself democratic

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.480
is that the government is elected democratically and the government is able to pressure the

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:28.880
workplace through the process of regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know,

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:35.040
minimum wage, all those kinds of things. That's the one idea. The other is there is a natural

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:42.320
force within the capitalist when there's no monopolies of competition being the accountability.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:49.040
So if you're a shitty boss, the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.640
to move to another company, work for a better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers

01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:02.000
and the bosses. That's at least the idea that there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.840
One is the law, so regulations passed by the government, democratic. And the second is,

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:15.600
because there's always alternatives in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:22.480
well because you can always leave. So, I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:29.600
saying is that does not result in a significant enough accountability with the employer

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:36.080
that avoids exploitation of the worker. Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:44.560
in those mechanisms. And let me respond to that and then on the counter argument. First, competition.

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:54.400
And here again, we have to be Hegelians just a little. Competition destroys itself. It doesn't

01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:00.080
need any. The whole point of competition is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:06.880
product as the other guy, either a better quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:12.320
the customers will come to me because my price is lower or my quality is better, and they'll leave

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:16.640
the other guy. He'll go out of business. Now, let's follow. When he goes out of business,

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:23.440
because I won the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to

01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:30.320
be able to serve a market he can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment. And

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:40.720
thereby many become few. Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis. It's the

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:47.440
product. Well, let's see. That's where it comes from. There's another element to the system where

01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:53.920
there's always a new guy that comes in. There isn't. Well, that's the dream. The entrepreneurial

01:22:53.920 --> 01:23:05.600
spirit of the United States, for example, of a capitalist system is you can be broke and one

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.840
day have a strong idea and build up a business that takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:17.360
and all the different car, Ford, GM, which is what, you know, you look at Tesla, for example,

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.600
right? That's the American dream. One of the many ideals of the American dream is you can

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:31.200
move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:33.920
Right. It can happen.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:38.000
It can happen. You know what that's like? That's like you can win the lottery.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.160
No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here you can work your ass off if you have

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.160
a good idea. The odds are better in the lottery. That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:54.480
How many Teslas do you know? Tesla's a really bad example because the car company,

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:03.600
the automotive sector, is so difficult. They operate at such a thin margin of profit.

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:10.880
They're probably a good example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:16.880
lack of innovation. That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:23.920
Come on. They have their uniquenesses, you're quite right, but so does every other industry.

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:29.760
The one thing that's common is that many become few. What you can also have is when you have a few,

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:36.080
they jack up the price, they make an enormous profit, and in the irony of capitalism,

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:42.480
Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize people to break into this industry because the

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:49.520
few remaining are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:58.320
to make it work like that for them. The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.320
share, that's a polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact,

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.680
an oligopolist, one of a handful of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:17.120
But yeah, to push back a little bit also, because this is a question also. Do you think we're in

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:25.920
danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic decency of human beings? So

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:34.800
if you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the competition, but that's going

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:38.640
to lead to a lot of suffering, there's a lot of people at the heads of companies that won't press

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:46.160
that button. In the calculation, it's not just money, it's human well-being too.

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:46.640
You think?

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.040
Yes.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.520
You and I don't live in the same place then.

01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:58.560
So you're saying that the forces of capitalism take over the minds of the people at the top,

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.920
and then they seize being human.

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:02.560
No.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.600
Essentially, the basic...

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:04.560
I wouldn't...

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.600
I mean, that's fine.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.560
Depending on your model of humans, they lose track of the better angels of their nature,

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.600
and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cogs at the top.

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:20.560
I would put it differently. The system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural selection.

01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.320
The guys who may... I could say the women too, it doesn't matter. The people who make it up

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.840
through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:38.160
along the way that become selective. If they can't stand it, because they have that human quality,

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.680
and there are people like... I've known them. They're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:49.360
They went there and they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.080
I'm going to make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever,

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.640
and I'm going to be enjoying the people that come by and be a decent human.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:06.240
Of course, of course. But the system selects the firm. If you don't do what has to be done

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:11.440
to make the profit go up, you're toast there anyway. The rest of the people who vote for you

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.320
are going to kick you out. You can tell them all day long what a lovely person you are.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.400
They're going to look at you and wonder what happened to you. How did you even get this far

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.440
with the lovely person horseshoe? It's not necessarily just lovely person.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:35.120
I'll just say my bias is the people I know, especially at the top of companies, are in the

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:45.120
tech sector where innovation is such a big part of it. I think a lot of the things we're talking

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.320
about is when there's not much innovation in the system.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.840
The history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts. There's the electric period,

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:02.080
the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you want to call it,

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:09.360
artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes and then there's a flurry as everything

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.240
is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is. You have a period where you

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:21.680
can get excited about that. The very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly,

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:32.880
as they always do, about innovation. Again, this is a recurring kind of debate and a recurring

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:41.360
kind of issue. For me, how do I put this in a way? I don't mean to offend.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:57.440
The problem with capitalism is, and maybe you'll like this, the problem with capitalism is

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.560
not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:09.600
would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite, that it is such a

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:19.120
contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite make it. There's

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.680
always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking about,

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:30.400
people you're talking about, who do quit along the way. Or maybe a few of them actually make it

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:37.520
to the top, by God knows what hook or what crook that they did it. But most of them go, and you

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:46.080
know why? Because their humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do.

01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:55.600
I mean, the corporate sector this year, just to give you an idea, CEOs are jacking up their

01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:02.720
wage package. They're already out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now 300 times

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:07.920
what the average worker pay is. But they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:13.280
what's happening in their universe. They're all doing it, and they have to do it. Each one of them

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.840
justifies it. I have to do that, otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one, which of course is

01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:23.040
true, but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument is very

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:32.080
exciting. So they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.400
through the COVID disaster. They've gone through the second worst economic crash of capitalism

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:46.160
in our history. After two years of this one-two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch,

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.280
and we are now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year or early

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.880
next year. You can't do this to a working class. When this was done to the German working class in

01:30:56.880 --> 01:31:04.080
the 1920s, Hitler was the result. You keep doing that in this country. We're already watching it.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:08.000
You're going to get that too. You're already getting bits and pieces. You can't keep doing it.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.920
So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:12.880
Taking out on it.

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.160
That can turn to anger.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:20.480
Some little 18-year-old kid who has to go three hours in his car and blow away people in a

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:26.080
supermarket. What? And it happens every day in this country. Every day.

01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:33.120
So that anger rises up in those little ways now and bigger and bigger potentially.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:40.400
By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality, and this goes to Elon Musk.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:49.680
If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The

01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:56.000
number was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:03.600
in the country. They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous amount of resources.

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:13.040
There is a way to make transportation much more rational, and we've known it for decades. It's

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:20.800
called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean,

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:30.480
frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this society.

01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:38.160
In fact, I once did a project that I estimate cost $30 billion. That's less than we're sending

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.920
to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it. A public transit system where?

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:47.920
Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country is an overwhelmingly

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:51.680
metropolitan area. Well, it surely has to be more than $30 billion.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:57.360
Well, it was a few years ago. Sure, but you're saying it's not a number that's insane.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.760
Right. It's not crazy stuff. It's a reasonable number.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:08.480
Right. Let me just finish the point. So I'm trying to be rational here.

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:16.080
If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do, if it's got a lot to do with fossil

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:21.360
fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use of the fossil fuel, particularly for

01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:28.880
the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass transit. We're doing nothing to

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:35.040
make that happen. Nothing. Well, you could argue that autonomous

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:40.000
vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going to be reusable vehicles. It will end,

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.640
in theory, car ownership. So you just have a more distributed public transit system.

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.400
If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal, and the major goal of

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:59.600
the other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller, so they have some,

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.120
Ford, General Motors, Toyota, all of them are making electric cars. So what they've done is

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:12.080
they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car. That's fucking

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.200
nuts. What are you doing? That's one of the things they're doing,

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.320
but automation is also another one. But on the Elon side, there's also a hilariously

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:25.520
named Boring Company, which is working on tunnels, which is actually expanding the

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.640
flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit, I think. Listen,

01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:38.880
I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas that I don't know if they know what a public transit

01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:45.680
system is, period. There's F-150 pickup trucks. Well, this is an interesting...

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880
So... By the way, footnote, the older this city,

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.800
the more likely it has public transportation. So you're saying...

01:34:54.800 --> 01:35:00.080
Boston is the best example. Have you been... Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I have a place in

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:05.360
Boston. Boston with the street railway, Boston is your case study of how to do this because they've

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.360
been doing it all along. New York's pretty good too. There's a trade-off. Yeah, New York, I would

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:16.080
say, is better than Boston because their technology also helps you out to do the public

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:21.920
transit better. It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point. But

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:31.760
the Ford F-150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America, and there is a practical nature

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:39.840
to the fact that in order to do public transit, in order to do some of these things that you're

01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:46.160
talking about with the working class, there has to be a central planning component or there has to

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:55.200
be a centralized component. And America is very much based on the idea of, at least in recent times,

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:59.920
I would say, from the founding of individualism, of respecting individual freedom.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:07.360
Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:15.520
you would trample on individual freedoms? No. Can you respect both? Sure. For me, Marxism is

01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:23.360
a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people who have had that freedom eroded

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:29.760
under the capitalism. That's a motive for my Marxism. It was for Marx, too. He loved the French

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:37.520
Revolution. He loved the liberté, égalité, fraternité, the great three, and then democracy,

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:43.200
the American contribution, if you like. He believed in all of that. His critique of capitalism was

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.280
it promised it and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond it is because

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:57.520
it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:08.560
a general—but again, I'm a Hegelian Marx, so if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:18.160
it's set up in this society, some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:24.880
pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.360
and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you what

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:34.320
to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem. There really is no

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:41.600
other way to explain the following in American politics. Large numbers of people lose their homes

01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:48.640
in a downturn, like the so-called Great Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:54.240
Large numbers of people go unemployed. And what are the media all about? The government.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.360
If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the workers by throwing them out of their home,

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:06.800
and they don't get angry with me. They get angry with the government. I fire large numbers of people.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:11.680
I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a result of having no job and no income.

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:19.840
And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way to the bank. This is a genius stroke.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.280
In theory. But if you look at government, because you said accountability in the capitalist system

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:29.120
has no accountability. There's some pushback. I give on the accountability. I think there is

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.800
some accountability we can discuss in a Hegelian way. There's more accountability.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:41.920
For I would say that in theory, government is perfectly accountable. That's the whole point

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:48.480
of a democratic system, is you vote people in. In practice, there's a giant growing bureaucracy

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:57.920
that is accountable only on the surface. There's two parties that seem to be the same. Media is

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:04.320
somehow integrated into making the same two parties that are just wearing different colored

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:10.880
shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing and bitterly arguing and calling each

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:21.520
other's names and all those kinds of things. But that's government. Who exactly is worse here,

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.120
government or companies? Why are we asking that question?

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:32.000
These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats just now,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.400
with which I agree, I would say the same thing about corporations and the government.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.240
This is the same people. Literally.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:44.240
But let's go to Churchill. Which one is worse? Let's go to Churchill. Democracy

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:49.360
is the worst form of government, except all the other ones or whatever. So this kind of same idea,

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.800
which one exactly is worse? Because to me, it seems like-

01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:54.560
Which one between what and what?

01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:01.040
Government and industry and companies. It's because government is plagued by,

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.000
I will call it corruption because the corruption of bureaucratic paperwork.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.600
There doesn't seem to be a serious accountability.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.800
Again, we're not living on the same planet. The greatest practitioners of central planning

01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:32.480
are corporations. Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:41.120
megacorps. They have to plan. They buy up companies because they don't want to deal in the market.

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:48.560
They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs or sell their outputs

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.720
to somebody they don't control. They want the professor to teach the genius of a market.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.320
They hate the market. And when they grow to be big, they keep buying whoever they were

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:06.640
dealing with before so they could better control them, which requires them then to plan the

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.000
production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying them in the market.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.960
The model of the government is the private corporation. I have spent my life,

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:24.960
give you an example, in American universities. Big ones, famous ones, not just as a student,

01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:29.120
but as a professor. I've been in half a dozen schools. I teach there. It's a new school here.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:35.120
It's another one, right? They all model themselves after businesses. They model their-

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:40.480
You can attack the bureaucracy of universities. Good reason. It's a mess.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:49.680
But they're proudly modeling themselves on organizing their bureaucracy in a business-like

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:57.920
manner. So you're looking at a difference which isn't there. The government and the private sector

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:04.400
are partners, and both of them wouldn't have it any other way. The corporations want that from

01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:10.560
the government, and the government now knows that to please the corporations is the number one

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.000
objective they have, because that's how they keep their jobs and keep their system going.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.560
And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:26.640
But there's important differences that, I don't know if they're fundamental or just

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.080
consequences of history, but if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.800
companies. Companies are accountable by, especially if you have a consumer,

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.760
they're accountable by the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:49.840
heck the company is selling. The government is accountable by votes, and it seems like

01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:57.760
government, unlike companies for most of companies' history, is always too big to fail,

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:03.280
meaning it can always just print money. It can always save itself, and that creates

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:12.320
a bureaucracy. You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government.

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:18.320
You distribute the blame, and it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions,

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:23.200
so bad decisions in government accumulate. So you become more and more and more inefficient,

01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:30.000
and more and more poor in your decision-making. You said public transit. Should we build a public

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.800
transit system in this city or not? That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:41.600
decision. I would say it's very often a very good decision, but whoever makes that decision

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:47.440
should be accountable for a good or bad decision, and it seems like companies are more accountable.

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:54.400
They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt.

01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:02.880
There's much more day-to-day pressure to make good engineering decisions. Government doesn't

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.760
seem to be under the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with that?

01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:11.920
I disagree with that. Everything in my history pushes me.

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:14.960
You may be living—I may be living in a different—

01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:16.640
Who knows?

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:21.120
A planet or taking a different sort of drug.

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:28.640
I won't mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a very large company here in the

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:38.880
United States, here in the New York area. It involved two brothers and a family who built

01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:49.360
it up into a huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo of the family,

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:55.600
and he was more responsible than anybody else building it up. But he took care of his brothers.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:02.880
He had a nice feeling about his brothers. So the one brother who could not, without help,

01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:10.000
tie his shoes became a vice president, got an enormous salary, got a beautiful office

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.400
in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right now. And

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:25.520
that was the way that family handled that company. And all of his relatives were somewhere

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:32.880
in this company doing a variety of whatever. And my experience with this,

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:39.920
and because I went to the schools I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:46.560
corporate executives, full of those stories, they made mistake after mistake, which they

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:55.200
would tell you about. Didn't undermine their—they were always able to blame somebody else, something

01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:00.880
else that scraped them through. And had they not been able to, they would have been replaced by

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:07.840
another person who did the same thing for as long as they could. And they knew it. They would talk

01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:15.600
about it at family events. That's how I know. I understand that you want the outside world to

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:24.480
look at it this way, but it's not my experience. But again, that kind of thing, at the risk of

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:33.200
saying human nature again, I wonder what kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:37.760
the question. I would call that, let's put that under the umbrella term of corruption.

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:41.280
Which system allows for more corruption?

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.600
But remember that the way I defined a different system is not more or less government.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:52.640
It's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when everybody

01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:00.880
has a vote? When you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:07.280
larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is that most

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:12.960
companies are responsible to. And now you've got a whole different universe. It's not a small group

01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:19.440
of people. Can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden. Most of it. And on and on and on. This is,

01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:23.360
you know, worker co-ops is what this is called in many parts of the world.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:27.520
So it's not that I'm advocating something that's never been seen before. Not at all.

01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:37.760
The Marxism I understand is to pick from historical precedents the things that we think will work

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:42.960
better. And I think if all the people in an enterprise, just to drive the point home,

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:49.600
democratically decided, they would never give two or three individuals $100 million while everybody

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:52.160
else can't send their kid to college. Nobody can do that.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:48:01.120
So just to address this point about the particular implementation of Marxism,

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:07.600
that was the early days in the Soviet Union. Why did Stalinism, for example,

01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:12.800
lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, and human suffering? Is there any elements

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:23.040
within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.840
that led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there were

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:35.680
many things that led to the bloodshed and to all that Stalin's regimes did. And, you know, I spent

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:44.640
10 years of my life with another economist writing a book about that to try to explain,

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:52.000
from a Marxist position, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union. You might want to take a look at it

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000
sometime. But there, I'm going to say a few things now, but all of those things are spelled out

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.360
in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc., in that work.

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.280
Let me start with, you know, playing a little bit with Hegel.

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:20.480
The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:26.800
Soviet Union did, but what the rest of the world did. I mean, you had a really interesting move.

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:37.600
And I'll give you a parallel from today. The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed.

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:46.000
World War I, it just fell apart. The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.920
been in trouble. There was a revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. I mean,

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:57.920
if you know Russian history, which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:08.720
to the collapse in 1917. And in some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small,

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:16.560
that could seize the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. You know, earlier on,

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:23.040
with Kerensky, the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism.

01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:29.120
People were more skeptical and would not have been called Marxists, probably, by history.

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:36.400
They tried. They couldn't. Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:45.120
same year. The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism,

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:51.120
having taken this immense leap from being a political party, a movement,

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:59.280
critical of capitalism, yes, but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:05.120
and in a big country. And they freaked out. If you know American history,

01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:10.400
this country, the leadership of this country went completely berserk. I mean,

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:18.160
we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s were a time of

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:27.520
Palmer raids in Boston, the Sackle-Vanzetti trials, I mean, really grim hostility.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.360
And you had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution.

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:39.120
The U.S., Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:49.520
So what you had right away was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable. There was a

01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:56.080
great professor at Princeton, Meyer, I forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book

01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:04.160
about all American foreign policy since 1917, has been obsessed with Russia. Even now,

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:10.960
this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia as if Russia still was the Soviet Union,

01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:16.960
as if people haven't figured out. That was a big change back in 1989 and 1990.

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:25.120
You know, Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least they're not Lenin. They may

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:33.120
not be so different from some of the others. But in any case, so you had one factor was the utter

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:42.000
isolation, the utter condemnation, the global. I mean, Rosa Luxemburg, I mean, I assume you know

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:47.760
that, you know, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's,

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:53.440
by the way, but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into bits, killed.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:53:00.800
So you're attributing some of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.760
turned away. Turned against. Turned against. So you turn against is the better word.

01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:13.440
Yeah, I mean, not in order of importance, but it's a very important part of the psychology of being,

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:19.760
you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite as much evidence that indeed

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:24.560
there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it. Look, you could see the

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:31.600
effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first, that you could have

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:38.240
socialism in one country. That was thought to be ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism.

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:45.040
Marx was against capitalism everywhere. It was, you know, workers of the world unite,

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:54.240
not workers of Russia unite. He had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms

01:53:54.560 --> 01:54:00.080
with the fact that the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin,

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:06.320
was tried in Munich, was tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here, they all failed.

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:13.200
They all failed. And he's left. Sur, the French would say. Tout sur, right? You know, all alone.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:21.760
That's one. The second thing is economic isolation. Russia's a poor country, and it needed

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.880
what it got before the war, which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans,

01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:33.760
particularly, but others too. Now this was all cut off. And you can see the replay with the sanctions

01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:40.480
program. We're going to do it again. We're going to do it again. We have to do it. The world is

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:46.640
different and the sanctions don't work, but they're going to try them. Because it's the history. But

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:52.240
that culture was, today is completely different. Russia's a different place today,

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.720
but Russia has China, and that changes everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:02.080
Yeah, there's a very complicated dynamic with China, even with India.

01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.760
Or Turkey. Brazil.

01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:10.240
Sorry to say human nature may change at a slower pace.

01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:15.040
That has occurred to me as well. I get that point.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:21.680
So can you still man the case, or consider the case, that there's something about the

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:28.400
implementation of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working

01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:36.080
class and the workers unite, that naturally leads to a formation of a dictatorial force,

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:46.240
a dictator that says, let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details

01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:52.560
of how to run the democracy, of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose.

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:57.120
And then that naturally leads to a dictator, and there's naturally, in human nature,

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:04.960
power and absolute power, as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:10.240
you focus on Marx's ideals, you're going to end up with a dictator? And often,

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:14.640
when you give too much power to any one human, a small number of people,

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.640
you're going to get into a huge amount of trouble.

01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:22.960
You've put things together there that I would accept. I think if you give-

01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:24.000
Putched is a good word.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:31.760
Yeah. It's German. Remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany.

01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:33.520
And then your dad is French.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:39.600
Yeah. But he was born in Metz, if you know European. It's a city on the border of France

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:45.520
and Germany. If you come from the Alsatians, Alsace in Germany.

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.880
So they're German speaking French.

01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:52.560
You have to do both. It's a bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.960
in medieval days already that it literally, you go from one store to another,

01:56:56.960 --> 01:57:02.320
the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German, but they all speak both languages

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:06.240
because you don't speak either of them?

01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:07.280
I speak Russian.

01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.120
Russian, but not German or French.

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:13.920
Ukrainian. It took French for four years in high school, but I've forgotten all of it.

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.120
I remember the romance and the spirit of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can

01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:19.620
remember.

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:30.080
If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long period of time,

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:39.600
and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks and it stays.

01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:45.120
And you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution and you will discover

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:51.280
it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people don't.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:59.520
If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism and that

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.560
it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was Zeus and

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.880
Diana and all the others, and they were very human-like, but instead we have one who is the

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:19.600
absolute beginning. What are you doing? You're teaching people an authority line that comes

01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:26.240
from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings, if in your feudal manner the Lord sits

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:33.040
called the landlord, he has unspeakable power over everything that goes on, and you do this

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:39.840
for thousands of years, you can make a Russian revolution in 1917, but if you imagine you've

01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:46.240
gotten away from all that people assume without ever thinking about it, you're going to have

01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:56.160
trouble. Stalin is figured here as the originator of his situation. He wasn't. He never had that

01:58:56.240 --> 01:59:03.280
power. He may have thought that, but I don't. He's the product. Look, the Cuban people made

01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:09.120
Fidel, who really wasn't that kind of guy. He's a baseball-playing lawyer, that's what he was,

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:18.880
but they made him into... You're the product of history. No, no, no. It was the systems,

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:25.760
feudalism, the literature. It was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:33.280
a mentality that has its own rhythm and doesn't follow the calendar of a political revolution.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:39.840
That's the fundamental question. Is there something about communism that creates a mentality that

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:47.600
enables somebody like Stalin or Mao? No, I think it's the social issues and problems

01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:54.560
that society has that make them then go to what they find familiar, to what seems to make sense,

01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:59.520
and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example from American history. The Republican

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:05.360
Party has traditionally, in this country, been the party of private enterprise and minimum government.

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:15.520
In comes Trump, runs for office in 2016, is elected. What does he do? He commences the most

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:23.840
massive tax increase and the most massive government intervention in the world of economics

02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:32.720
that we've had for decades. Nobody says anything. The Republicans cave, and the Democrats largely,

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:41.600
too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on anything. He gets up in front of the American people,

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:46.960
and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff. That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:53.120
works. He would flunk a freshman course in economics, which everybody knows. Everybody

02:00:53.280 --> 02:01:00.400
teaches these courses. No, it doesn't matter. He's still calling the shots. What is going on here

02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:08.800
is that a society has come to a point where it can't solve its problems, and it begins what?

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:17.360
To tap into older forms, and all of the laissez-faire, and all of the individualism,

02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:24.720
and suddenly the Republican party is gung-ho, and now they're going to make abortion illegal.

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:32.560
The government is telling you what you can do with your uterus. What? What? The government

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:38.000
is being given more and more and more and more power. They're hoping. What? Do they like the

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:45.760
government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro-government, and it wasn't in Russia Island.

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:51.440
They were in a desperate fix, and he took advantage.

02:01:52.640 --> 02:02:01.040
To which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the

02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:11.280
National Socialism Party of German workers, hence the Nazi party, the fascist party in the 30s

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:17.360
and the 40s, the head of whom was Hitler, which I just recently learned he was

02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:23.680
employee number seven of the party, or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party,

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:30.080
and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history

02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:38.000
of the 20th century? What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the National

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:43.600
Socialist Party of German workers. Right. Workers.

02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:51.600
Nationalistische Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, German worker party.

02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:55.520
Worker party. National Socialist German worker party.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:03:01.040
Well, here's the history. Did he care about the workers, or did he just use the workers

02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:06.400
as a populist message? The only thing that Marxism did for Mr.

02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:12.640
Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power, but had nothing, no other. He didn't know

02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:17.120
anything about it, didn't care anything about it, nor did the people around him. Here's the story

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.720
of what happened there, which I know largely through my own family and plus my own history,

02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:29.440
the work that I did. The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German party.

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:36.400
It started around 1870. Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were leaders,

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:43.360
Fernand Lassalle and others, his daughters. By the end of the century, it was the second most

02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:52.320
important party in Germany. Nobody understood it. It was almost as big a shock to the Europeans

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:59.280
as was the Russian Revolution in 1970. Here was a political party that was now in every German city

02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:08.800
and every German town, powerful and enjoying its rise up. My family is involved in this. I

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:20.880
really do know the story. It meant that starting around 1968, if you wanted to have any kind

02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:28.400
of presence in the German working class, you had to use the word socialist. You had to. Otherwise,

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.520
they wouldn't pay attention. The other parties called themselves Catholic.

02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:40.640
Germany is divided. The northern two-thirds is Protestant. The southern third is Catholic.

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:45.600
Munich and Bavaria is Catholic, and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant.

02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:52.640
You could be in the Catholic party. That was the South. Or you could be in various conservative,

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:57.920
Prussian and other. If you wanted to have a presence in the working class,

02:04:57.920 --> 02:05:04.240
which was growing. Germany was a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this

02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:11.040
time. Germany was the major competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up

02:05:11.040 --> 02:05:18.400
too, but it was Germany and the US taking over from Britain's empire. The German working class was it.

02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:27.440
Anybody who wanted to approach the working class in whatever way had to come to terms

02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:35.600
and be friendly to socialism. Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word

02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:42.720
socialist in their party, but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with

02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:48.880
the Soviet Union or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:56.560
four letters of national. National in German, NAZI is how you spell national in the German language.

02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:00.960
National, socialism, but definitely not communists. That's right. They killed communists.

02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:07.600
They fought communists in the street. They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:13.120
other's existence and their lives. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not

02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:19.200
Jews and gypsies and all the other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:25.600
the number one and socialists right behind him. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:33.120
1933, that's when Hitler takes power. The last elections, two of them in 1932, the socialists

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:39.760
and communists, the vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany. So he appealed to the German

02:06:40.960 --> 02:06:46.480
manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said the communists and socialists are going to win.

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:51.360
You won't, and you're just the capitalist. You have too few people.

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:56.080
You need a mass base, and I'm the only one that can do that.

02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:59.520
And it was just a populist message that he used.

02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:07.360
That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:11.920
the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.880
you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have done it. He had

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:23.600
called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler as a little

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:29.680
funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German. For them, that mattered.

02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:38.400
So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism, which he immediately does.

02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:46.640
Only people who don't know or care about the history pick up on the word.

02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:52.160
You know, it's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,

02:07:53.680 --> 02:08:00.800
we are not a democracy, we are a republic, which is like saying I'm not a banana, I'm a fruit.

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:07.440
You have to explain to these people a banana is a kind of thing. So you have to explain to people,

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:14.000
yes, we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic.

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:18.560
Because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government. You have to go through

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:23.600
that with people so they kind of get it. And certain words have power beyond their

02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:30.640
actual meaning. They're used in communication, whether it's negative, like racist, or positive,

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.080
like freedom of speech. Or Democrat. Or Democrat. With a D.

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:36.640
And then you use that to mean something.

02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:37.280
Who knows?

02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:41.360
Or negative. Stop, Donnie, stop being a socialist.

02:08:43.200 --> 02:08:48.400
Whatever that means that's not even used in any kind of philosophical or economic sense.

02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:52.000
So let's fast forward to today. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.

02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:59.040
There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:04.320
socialism and maybe let's try to start sneak up on a definition of what that could possibly mean.

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:10.400
But AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's from these parts.

02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.120
Yes, Queens.

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:21.600
So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism?

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:26.560
Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?

02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:28.640
Okay.

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:31.440
Where do I begin?

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.480
The socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx,

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.600
and has gone on to develop separately after Marx's death.

02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:51.360
Can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between Marxism

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:59.040
and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to like,

02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:05.040
maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?

02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:16.560
Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis, heavily focused on economics, and as I said earlier,

02:10:17.280 --> 02:10:23.120
devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism,

02:10:25.520 --> 02:10:33.040
and that's its strength, how it does that, how it poses the questions, how it analyzes

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:39.200
the way capitalism works. That is really the forte of the Marxist tradition.

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:48.400
Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism figures it's there, so that people who

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:55.040
aren't Marxists are nonetheless aware of Marxism, like it more or less, study it more or less,

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:02.960
but it's a broader notion that I like to use this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea

02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:10.960
that we can do better than capitalism, that really there are all kinds of things about

02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:19.360
capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the world think are adequate,

02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:24.880
that we are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who thought they could do better than

02:11:24.880 --> 02:11:31.280
slavery and all the people who thought they could do better than feudalism. We've made progress.

02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.320
Feudalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a progress over both of them,

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.520
and progress hasn't stopped, and we are the people who, in a variety of ways, want

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:52.640
the progress to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is somehow

02:11:52.640 --> 02:12:00.640
the best beyond which we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of the word,

02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:07.920
a reactionary way of thinking, and we're that large community. Many of us are not interested

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:16.080
in economics all that much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example,

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:22.240
because we want to do something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about

02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:29.600
to kill itself physically, and we want to take steps with other people to stop that,

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:35.680
to fix that, et cetera, et cetera. So that's, for me, a kind of difference.

02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:44.160
It's a little difficult to say because there's no other figure like Marx that has an equal

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:52.640
impact, an equal place within the broad socialist tradition. And the only tradition that comes

02:12:52.640 --> 02:13:01.680
close might be the anarchist tradition, but that's very specialized, and that's a whole

02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:07.440
other kind of conversation. And whatever you say, the influence of the great anarchist thinkers,

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:16.720
Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorrel, and others still doesn't amount to the impact that Marx

02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:21.680
and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but up to this point,

02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:28.800
I think that's a way of understanding the relationship.

02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:33.440
Yeah, that's interesting that some of the ideas within anarchism, and of course,

02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:40.960
it's one of the more varied disciplines, because there's such, maybe by definition,

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:50.640
such variety in their thinkers, but they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center,

02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:56.640
and that, if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.

02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.760
Absolutely.

02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:00.160
So where you have the, you know...

02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:04.080
There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas

02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:12.400
that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation from Lenin.

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:21.520
People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin, and it was made by Lenin positive.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:27.520
In other words, Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for. We want

02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:33.760
to create the conditions under which there is a wither. Because you remember the communists,

02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:38.800
or whatever, they weren't called that at first in Russia, before the revolution. They were just

02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:44.320
socialists. They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right. They had no

02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:51.600
love for the government. The government was their literal everyday enemy. And being critical of

02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:57.600
government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole... Being a Marxist,

02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:03.120
you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is you're struggling

02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:08.960
against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially because if you

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:14.560
understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.

02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:19.840
One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia,

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:25.920
and he goes back centuries. It's a huge book, three or four inches thick. And I'm one of the

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:34.640
few people who've read it. And he's very good about the absence of a strong central government

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:39.680
in many parts of feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe.

02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:46.320
The development of a powerful central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:52.160
to hold on, which ought to be suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments

02:15:52.160 --> 02:16:00.160
here in the United States or in Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted

02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:10.800
and can't go on and has to marshal every last bit of power it can not to be lost in history.

02:16:10.800 --> 02:16:14.800
It would be interesting to see what the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died.

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:19.600
A lot of people have asked that question over the years. A lot of people.

02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:24.160
There is Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night,

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:26.480
erasing the withering away of the state part.

02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:27.520
Yes, exactly.

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:33.920
Just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:38.320
political figures that represent some of these ideas? And they sometimes refer to those ideas

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.680
as democratic socialism.

02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.680
Right. The crucial thing about Bernie and about AOC, and it's particularly true about Bernie,

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.840
because AOC is much younger and Bernie is an older man.

02:16:51.360 --> 02:17:00.720
Bernie, being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student, as an activist,

02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:05.440
and then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all the rest.

02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:12.720
He lived through, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:18.960
And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945-6 to the present,

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:26.720
I mean it really never stopped, was a Manichaean worldview.

02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:32.000
The United States is good, it defines democracy, and the Soviet Union is awful,

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.000
it defines whatever the opposite of democracy should be called.

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:47.440
Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks of academic individuals,

02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:56.240
it was impossible to have a conversation. I mean, I can't tell, just make it very personal,

02:17:56.240 --> 02:18:02.800
the number of times I would raise my hand in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale.

02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:08.640
And I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,

02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:13.440
because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me,

02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.160
except by people who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that.

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:26.640
So I would ask a question, and I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:32.400
much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear, which is just fear. They

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.120
didn't want to go there. They didn't want to answer my question. And after a while,

02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:42.160
I got to know some of them, and I found out why. Because you don't know how the rest of the class

02:18:42.160 --> 02:18:46.800
is going to understand this. Either they would have to say, I don't know, which would be the

02:18:46.800 --> 02:18:51.680
honest truth for many of them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, I don't know,

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:59.520
that's just not cool. Or if they knew, they'd have to say something that indicated they didn't

02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:05.360
know really much, and they weren't going to do that. Or they would know something, and maybe

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:11.440
that would be because they were interested. They did not want the rest of the students

02:19:11.440 --> 02:19:19.600
to begin to say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, you know, he's interested. It's not good for

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:23.760
your career. You don't know how this is going to play out. Who's going to say what to whom?

02:19:24.720 --> 02:19:28.480
And I could see in their faces what I later learned, because they told me,

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:35.680
come to my office hours. We're in the office. We can talk about it. But that's how bad it was.

02:19:36.640 --> 02:19:38.160
Is it not still?

02:19:38.160 --> 02:19:44.720
Pretty much. In my field, the great so-called debate, I mean, I find it boring, but the great

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:51.840
debate for my colleagues is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics.

02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:58.080
Neoclassical, the government should stay out of the economy. Let's say fair or liberalism.

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:02.800
And the Keynesians saying, no, you crazy neoclassical. If you do that, you'll have

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:08.400
great depressions, and the system will collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the

02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:13.680
problems, to fix the weaknesses. And they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their

02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:18.880
jobs. One of the very few things they can do together that they agree on is keeping people

02:20:18.880 --> 02:20:27.760
like Meowth. That they can find common ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own.

02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:37.280
Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means that all of the complicated developments

02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:47.600
within Marxism and within socialism of the post-World War II period, the vast bulk of all of that

02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:55.040
is unknown, not just to the average American person, but to the average American academic,

02:20:55.040 --> 02:21:01.200
to the average American who thinks of himself or herself as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:09.680
spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet history. They have no idea. Or saying,

02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:17.520
there's this man, Lukács, a Hungarian Marxist. He really had interest to explain that Gramsci

02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:23.920
was not a great literary critic. He was head of the Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:32.320
life. What does that mean? You like Gramsci as a literary critic, but they didn't even know.

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:38.640
They don't even know. It's been erased. It's a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:44.960
and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet Union because he obviously fell out of favor,

02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:50.080
and so somehow all of his writings, many of which are very interesting and complicated.

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:59.120
Anyway, so what you're going to have in this country is a slow awakening of socialism from

02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:06.400
a long hibernation called the Cold War. I never expected, to be very honest with you, that I would

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:12.800
live to see. I knew it would come, because these things always do, but I didn't expect to see it.

02:22:12.800 --> 02:22:20.640
So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us, that when it starts to happen, it happens fast.

02:22:21.840 --> 02:22:30.000
You see, Bernie is an early sign of the awakening from the Cold War to accept the idea of socialism.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.040
Bernie was always a socialist. We all knew, and everybody who paid attention, he didn't hide it,

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:44.240
but 2016, he makes a decision, momentous, to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont.

02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:49.680
Vermont is one of the smallest states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.880
you that there are more cows than people in Vermont, et cetera, et cetera. So here from

02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:01.760
this little state, this elderly gentleman with a New York City accent runs for all and says,

02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:06.960
I'm a socialist. And when they attack him, he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist.

02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:13.280
Now, he had been. It wasn't a secret that suddenly got out. But the great question—and

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:19.360
I don't mind telling you, because I went to the right schools. I know a lot of people—you know,

02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:25.600
Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale, and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official

02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.480
of the Democratic Party, and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?

02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:37.600
Makes no difference. They get 1% of the vote. Right? He was wrong. Yeah, they had no idea

02:23:37.600 --> 02:23:42.960
what was coming. But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it.

02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:47.040
I thought his 1% was probably right. So we were both wrong.

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:51.120
Yeah. Change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president one day?

02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:56.960
Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one,

02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:07.120
it's fast. Number two, it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin

02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:17.040
with the most moderate, calm, non-confrontational socialism you can imagine.

02:24:17.040 --> 02:24:18.560
So not AOC or Bernie.

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:22.080
No, no. They are not confrontational, in my judgment.

02:24:22.080 --> 02:24:25.680
In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.

02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:34.400
They're feisty personally, but not ideologically. You know, Bernie is also,

02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:41.840
in honest moments, and they both really are pretty honest folks, at least in my experience.

02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:49.840
In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates as democratic socialism

02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:58.560
is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular government, tax the rich

02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:04.880
a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the working class than you do now.

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:10.320
That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means by socialism.

02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:15.680
When he talks about it and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot.

02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:22.640
Okay, that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism.

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:25.920
And that's where we're going to start, in a country coming out of hibernation.

02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:32.160
Pretty soon, it's already happening, there'll be people who need and want to go further

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:36.640
in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are comfortable with.

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:39.680
You can already see the shoots of it now.

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:46.160
AOC voted, together with most of the others, to support the money for Ukraine.

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:50.400
A lot of people in the socialist movement do not support that.

02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:57.520
I don't know exactly how that's going to work out, but that should give people an idea.

02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.360
There are disagreements, and they're going to fester, and they're going to grow.

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:06.080
It's interesting. People in the socialist sphere don't support

02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:10.880
the money from the United States in the large amounts that it is being sent to Ukraine.

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.760
Is it because it's fundamentally the military industrial complex is a capitalist institution?

02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:21.840
There are some people for whom that's the issue. Then there are people for whom

02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:29.520
it's guns and butter, and why are we over there when we have such needs at home that are being

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:35.520
neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what we talked about at the beginning,

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:43.440
who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between Western capitalism and Russian

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:51.360
oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine. What are we doing here? We have to insist that these

02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:57.680
forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate a settlement. Don't kill large numbers

02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:02.960
of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight to the last Ukrainian. It's a little strange here.

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:07.840
What are you doing? You're supposed to be in favor of peace, and for the United States,

02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.680
which just finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and Iraq, to be against another

02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:18.240
country invading. I mean, who in the world is going to take this seriously? This is crazy.

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:26.960
I invade, it's good, and you invade, it's terrible. What? What are you doing? Why are you doing this?

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:33.440
What's going on here? All of these questions are being active, by the way, not just by socialists,

02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:39.360
by lots of other people too, inside the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party.

02:27:40.160 --> 02:27:46.160
You watch that Tucker Carlson or people like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They don't

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.640
want the money spent there. They don't want the weapons sent there. They don't like the whole

02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:58.080
policy, and Trump wobble. So Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:05.440
right, and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:16.240
AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War

02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:25.760
isolation from the whole. When I explain to people the contribution made, for example,

02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:30.560
to modern Marxism, I'll give you an example, by the French philosopher,

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:37.120
Luis Althusser, I don't know if the name means anything to you. Okay, he was the rector of the

02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:44.080
École Normale Supérieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there were

02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:52.080
a university that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and MIT. It would be the university.

02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:59.040
Well, the École Normale in France, in Paris, is the. He was a tenured professor who became the

02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:04.480
rector. The rector is like the president of the university, an active member of the French

02:29:04.480 --> 02:29:10.320
Communist Party most of his adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War.

02:29:10.400 --> 02:29:14.560
That was unthinkable in this country. You could not in a million years.

02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:26.800
Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring a version of postmodernism into Marxism with

02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:33.760
enormous impact all over the world where he traveled, not just in Europe, all over. So

02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:47.840
if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for you. Althusser. Look him up, you'll see tons

02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:53.760
of stuff. By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works in English.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:59.600
By the way, the textbook I wrote in economics, in case you're ever interested,

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:02.320
was also published by the MIT Press. And the title?

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:07.840
Contending Economic Theories, Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian.

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:10.400
That's an MIT. Marxian.

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:13.040
Yeah, that's right. And by the way, when we think,

02:30:14.640 --> 02:30:19.040
I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between Marxian economics and Marxist.

02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:24.960
I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that.

02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:32.240
I only use it because Marxist I use as a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:37.200
I use as an adjective to qualify. But I don't mean some great difference.

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:42.800
There's a last point I would like to make about AOC and Bernie that's also general.

02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:51.120
I'm a historian, too. And I know that the transition out of feudalism in Europe to

02:30:51.120 --> 02:30:57.760
capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred in fits and starts. So, for

02:30:57.760 --> 02:31:05.040
example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate. Serfs would run away. They'd run into a town.

02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:09.840
How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because they had run away

02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:16.000
from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal understanding

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:23.680
what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the business of buying and

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:29.440
then reselling stuff and living off the difference. But you know, I could make more money if I produce

02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:36.000
some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody else. So I'm going to make you a deal.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:40.880
I'm going to give you money. Once a week, I'll give you money, what we would later call a wage.

02:31:40.880 --> 02:31:45.200
And you come here and under my supervision, you make this crap that I'm going to then sell

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:52.320
and this all works out. In other words, there were efforts, unconscious,

02:31:52.960 --> 02:32:00.960
not self-aware, to go out of feudalism to a new system. Some of them lasted a few days

02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:07.520
and then fell apart. Some of them lasted weeks or months or years. But it took a long time

02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:17.840
before the conditions were ready for a kind of a general switch. And once that was done,

02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:23.920
it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we have today. That's the only model we

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:32.480
have. So for me, that's what I see when I look at socialism. I see the Paris Commune was an event,

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:39.760
an attempt. It lasted a few weeks. I see Russia. That was an attempt. It lasted 70 years.

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:46.640
Then I see, and you fill in the blank, I see these are all early experiments. These are all

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:54.640
you learn things to do, learn things never to do again. The good, the bad. What do you build on?

02:32:54.640 --> 02:32:59.520
How do you learn? And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition, when it's serious,

02:33:00.240 --> 02:33:05.440
that's what it does. So in your ideas, sort of capitalism was a significant improvement over

02:33:05.440 --> 02:33:13.040
the feudalism. And we are coming to an age for slavery, and we're coming to an age where

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:21.040
capitalism will die out. It's not that capitalism is somehow fundamentally broken. It's better than

02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.840
the things that came before it, but there's going to be things yet better, and they will be grounded

02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:35.440
in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there, just to linger briefly on the way Marxism is used

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:42.880
as a term on Twitter, there's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using the terms incorrectly, but

02:33:43.840 --> 02:33:52.880
cultural Marxism, criticisms of universities being infiltrated by cultural Marxists.

02:33:53.840 --> 02:34:01.920
I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke. There's a kind of woke

02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:11.440
ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text? Who's the Karl Marx of wokeness?

02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:20.960
All I do know is that there are certain characteristics of woke ideology, which is

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:30.400
hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys. And basically everyone is a bad guy,

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:37.360
except the people that are very loudly, nonstop saying that they're the good guy. And that applies

02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:48.960
for racism, for sexism, for gender, gender politics, identity politics, all that kind of stuff.

02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:57.120
Is there any parallels between Marxian economics and Marxist ideology and

02:34:57.120 --> 02:35:05.760
whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter? No, not much. One of the consequences of the

02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:13.360
taboo after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words. It's

02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:19.920
like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four-letter word to

02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:26.720
describe somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many circles,

02:35:26.720 --> 02:35:32.960
this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used. But it doesn't have a

02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:41.760
particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is somebody who is

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:50.720
concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation and gender and all of those things

02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:59.440
and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms. And I don't like any of these people, so I slap

02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:07.440
the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism, because it isn't Marxism about getting more money

02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.600
or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists somehow

02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:18.560
are concerned about. So this is odd, since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always been

02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:24.560
interested in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that's what

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:31.920
they're famous for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture. Gramsci

02:36:31.920 --> 02:36:39.120
writes a great length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy and on and on.

02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:43.360
I mean, this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't

02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:50.400
know what the names are. It's a label that summarizes, kind of a shorthand, I'm against

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:55.600
all of this. I don't want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country, and it always has

02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:03.760
been, or sexism, or phobia against gay people, or whatever it is that's agitating them,

02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:13.280
Marxism, or socialism. I mean, it's like socialism is the post-off. It is a mentality. Well,

02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:20.080
but I don't blame them. I mean, it's childish, it's mean-spirited, but it comes out of the fact

02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:26.480
no one ever sat them down and said, you know, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of

02:37:26.480 --> 02:37:33.280
things that people kind of share, and these big differences. Look, an intelligent society,

02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:40.800
which this country is, could have and should have done that. It was fear and a kind of terror

02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:45.680
that made them behave in the way they did, and we're now seeing it. Having said that,

02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:52.800
there is such a thing as cultural Marxism. What that is, is simply those Marxists

02:37:54.320 --> 02:38:04.720
who devoted themselves to analyzing how it is that a particular culture is, on the one hand,

02:38:04.720 --> 02:38:11.040
shaped by capitalism, and on the other hand, becomes a condition for capitalism to survive

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:19.680
and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the interaction between the class struggle on the job

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:28.240
and attitude towards sexuality, or movements in music, or whatever else culture? And there are

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:36.160
Georg Lukacs, this Hungarian, great name in there, the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci,

02:38:36.160 --> 02:38:41.840
and a modern name just died a couple years ago, a British intellectual named Stuart Hall,

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:50.480
H-A-L-L. If I were teaching, which I have done, a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:58.720
major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you articles and books to read of their stuff,

02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.120
because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many others.

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:08.080
So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that capitalism creates

02:39:08.080 --> 02:39:15.040
and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes. And Marxists are particularly those who like

02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:20.640
to look at that interaction. In other words, they're interested in how capitalism shapes culture,

02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:26.880
and how culture shapes capitalism. There's another name I forgot. Stuart Hall is British,

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:38.080
Gramsci is Italian, Lukacs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin, B-E-N-J-A-M-I-N.

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:44.880
He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that developed in

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:51.040
Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in cultural questions.

02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:57.360
It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on economics and

02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:03.680
politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts of modern society

02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:10.080
that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that impetus to open

02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:16.880
Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand that this cult—and

02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.760
they called themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different meaning from this.

02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:30.000
This is just bad-mouthing. That's all it is. Let me ask a more personal question.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.640
Sure. For most of the 20th century—no, not most, but a large many decades in the United States

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.320
as a consequence of the Cold War and before, being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be.

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:49.920
Have you had dark periods in your own life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind

02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:57.920
where it was difficult, like self-doubt, difficult to know, like, what the hell am I doing when you're

02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:03.920
surrounded by colleagues and people? You said prestigious universities, both personal interests

02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:11.120
of career, but also as a human being, when everybody kind of looks at you funny,

02:41:11.280 --> 02:41:17.360
because you're studying this thing. Did that ever get you real low?

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:22.880
No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.

02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:26.000
If I were you, I'd be asking me that question, too.

02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:28.800
And what's wrong with you?

02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:35.440
Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am.

02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:42.320
I really don't. But the truth is, no. I have—if my wife was sitting here, she'd tell

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:48.080
you what she tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true.

02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:54.320
But then again, luck never is the only explanation for things. It's part of it.

02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.800
What can I say? I didn't choose the time of my birth. I didn't choose

02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:06.880
the communities in which I grew up or the schools I attended or anything else.

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.680
No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on marketing and economics—

02:42:11.680 --> 02:42:16.960
But you know, again, I'm Hegel. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.

02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:24.320
On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation when you do that

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:30.160
is very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook taking notes of what the

02:42:30.160 --> 02:42:36.320
great professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam. I don't have an exam.

02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:46.480
I'm doing something slightly risque, you know, kind of romantically different and oppositional.

02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:54.720
I was able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom

02:42:54.720 --> 02:43:01.920
situation, other students who felt enough similar to me that we could get together and read these

02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:09.040
books and talk about them. I had a number of really fortuitous people who were kind to me

02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:16.880
and gave me of their time and their effort to teach me along the way. And I've had the benefit

02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:23.680
that because I went to all these fancy schools, I do know a lot of people who are in high places

02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:30.080
in this culture. And when I have been put in difficult positions, I often waive my pedigree

02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:36.480
and it works like garlic with the devil. They're back away. They're back away. Because Americans

02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:42.160
are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige. But there's a personal psychological

02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:50.320
thing that seems that you have never been shaken by this. You have just naturally somebody

02:43:51.280 --> 02:43:53.600
who just has perseverance.

02:43:54.720 --> 02:43:57.440
Well, I would put it, I mean, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little

02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:06.160
differently. I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system.

02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:15.280
And nothing has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development just

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:23.200
kept giving me more and more evidence that this, and I must say over the last 10 years,

02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:30.160
what's really changed? The last 10 years. I mean, I can't describe to you how big that changes.

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.760
And that may be more important than anything else we've discussed. Up until 10 years ago,

02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:42.400
I would do a public event, an interview on television or a radio thing,

02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:49.520
or give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months, I'd be invited,

02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:57.360
and I would do it, like academics often do. I now do two to three to four interviews every day.

02:44:58.720 --> 02:45:01.520
So there's a hunger.

02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:04.320
It's fascinating.

02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:09.360
And you know, and I want to be honest with you. As I say at the end of some of my talks,

02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:15.120
I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause from the podium, you know, that I lean into the

02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:21.280
microphone and I say, with as much smile as I can get, I'm having the time of my life.

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:30.320
And that's the truth. That's the truth. I never expected, look, I'm used to teaching a classroom,

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:34.880
a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students, or a

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:41.120
graduate students with eight or nine or 10 students, or a regular undergraduate class with

02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.880
30, or an occasional introductory course with a few hundred. I've done all of those things many

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:56.400
times. But an audience, you know, that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all

02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:58.080
of that. No, that's new.

02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:08.000
Is there advice you can give, given your bold and non-standard career and life, advice you can give

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:14.480
to high school students, college students about how to have a career like that, or maybe how to

02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:25.120
have a career or a life they can be proud of? Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for it.

02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:31.520
The conditions for doing that now are infinitely better than they were when I had to do it.

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:40.800
And I could do it. And I'm happy I did it. Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made

02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:48.800
that I've never regretted. And I've never regretted being a critic of this society.

02:46:49.440 --> 02:46:59.520
Never. I find it edifying. I mean, the gratitude people express to me for helping them see kind

02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:04.640
of what's going on is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you?

02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:11.680
So that fills you with joy. Pointing out that the emperor has no clothes fills you. That's a life

02:47:11.680 --> 02:47:17.440
and not just important. It's because most of the people who say something like that to me

02:47:17.440 --> 02:47:23.200
are people who, if they had the vocabulary, and some of them do, would say, you know,

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:30.960
I thought I was seeing through that outfit that I was wearing. I thought it, and they did. And all

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:39.920
they needed was a little extra this information or that factoid or this logic. And I remember

02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:46.800
having that too. When I had a teacher who made something clear that had been murky, I always felt

02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:55.040
gratitude. And now I get that gratitude a good bit. And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm

02:47:55.040 --> 02:48:04.720
not sure I could get it any other way. I have learned, and I'm walking proof, that being a

02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:12.400
critic of society and doing it systematically and sharing it with other people makes for a

02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:15.360
very good life. A very good life.

02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:23.520
Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.

02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:27.680
Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?

02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:36.720
Afraid of it, no. Think about it, yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought, you know,

02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:41.840
death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead. It's not going to bother you

02:48:41.840 --> 02:48:49.200
very much. I worry more about my wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you,

02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:56.480
I got married when I was 23 years old, and that's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky.

02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:02.800
If you get married to anybody at age 23, it's either luck or it isn't.

02:49:03.440 --> 02:49:08.560
What role has love played in your life?

02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:15.920
Enormous. Because I came from a family. You know, if your family is political refugees,

02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:22.160
which mine were, who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent,

02:49:22.160 --> 02:49:30.960
learn another language, find another life income and job, the disruption goes real deep

02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:40.160
for any refugee. So my mother and father were both refugees. They met as refugees.

02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:50.720
So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had to be—I was the first child of their—I

02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:57.920
have a younger sister, but I was the first child. And, you know, there's a lot of psychological

02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:04.640
pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm, but you've got to do

02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.640
what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do.

02:50:10.640 --> 02:50:17.200
It's the closest they're going to get to what they had hoped. And my parents were both university

02:50:17.200 --> 02:50:23.280
students. My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.

02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:32.560
Um, so I had to perform. You know, I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get all

02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:37.360
A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to do all

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:44.640
these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that way.

02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.120
But that's functional in this dysfunctional society.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:55.440
But on top of that, that's an achievement within the game of this particular society.

02:50:55.440 --> 02:51:01.120
But then love seems to be a thing that's greater than that game. Is that something that made you a

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:06.320
better person? How has it made you a better Marxian and a better—

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:12.480
Everything. Because my wife by profession is a psychotherapist.

02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:14.160
Excellent. I love it.

02:51:14.240 --> 02:51:21.120
And I needed it. And so I married it. I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I think

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:28.240
as I look back on it, that was more than a little what was going on. And she has tutored me all my

02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:36.800
life about a whole range of aspects of life that my family never talked about, never dealt with,

02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:43.200
never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.

02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:46.800
Because it was all about survival. The immigrant challenge is survival.

02:51:46.800 --> 02:51:54.080
Survive, survive. And you're so busy that you tell yourself you can't do that. Of course,

02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:58.240
you can. And there are other reasons why you're not going to look at those problems.

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:05.520
But the survival is so urgent that you can fool yourself this way. And my parents did that.

02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:10.000
One last question. What's the meaning of life, Richard Wolff?

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:13.200
I will quote you, Mr. Marx.

02:52:14.800 --> 02:52:15.280
Let's go.

02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:25.680
Life is struggle. And for me, I have found that to be true, that the struggle,

02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:34.240
whether it is to build a relationship with your child—I have two children—whether it's to build

02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:41.680
one with your spouse, whether it's to understand a complicated argument and simplify it so that you

02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:48.880
can share the pleasure of understanding this relationship to a student or to an audience,

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:58.240
it's a struggle to do all those things. But that network of struggles, that makes life

02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:03.680
interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:05.200
And meaningful.

02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:06.560
Very meaningful.

02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:10.960
And that latter thing, I've got to say you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators

02:53:10.960 --> 02:53:16.240
and educators out there today, and it's a huge honor that you will sit with me for so many hours.

02:53:16.240 --> 02:53:16.720
Thank you.

02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:17.440
This is awesome.

02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:29.200
From Carl Marx.

02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:34.080
The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways.

02:53:34.800 --> 02:53:37.760
The point, however, is to change it.

02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:42.320
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
