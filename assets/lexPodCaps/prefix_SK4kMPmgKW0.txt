00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
The lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War

00:07.360 --> 00:18.160
is that human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing

00:19.200 --> 00:25.840
more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military

00:25.840 --> 00:31.360
force. At the end of the day, in 1918, one side did win that,

00:32.320 --> 00:35.120
but it didn't actually solve any of those political problems.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.840
You said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state in the U.S. Can you explain?

00:42.640 --> 00:48.640
The following is a conversation with Christopher Cappazzola, a historian at MIT specializing

00:48.640 --> 00:54.080
in the history of politics and war in modern American history, especially about the role of

00:54.080 --> 01:00.240
World War I in defining the trajectory of the United States and our human civilization in the

01:00.240 --> 01:06.240
20th and 21st centuries. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our

01:06.240 --> 01:11.120
sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Christopher Cappazzola.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.920
Let's start with a big and difficult question. How did World War I start?

01:16.640 --> 01:22.560
On the one hand, World War I started because of a series of events in the summer of 1914

01:23.280 --> 01:28.640
that brought the major powers of Europe into conflict with one another. But I actually think

01:28.640 --> 01:37.200
it's more useful to say that World War I started at least a generation earlier when rising powers,

01:37.200 --> 01:42.720
particularly Germany, started devoting more and more of their resources toward military

01:42.720 --> 01:48.320
affairs and naval affairs. This sets off an arms race in Europe. It sets off a rivalry

01:49.040 --> 01:55.360
over the colonial world and who will control the resources in Africa and Asia. And so by the time

01:55.360 --> 02:01.200
you get to the summer of 1914, in a lot of ways, I say the war has already begun. And this is just

02:01.200 --> 02:08.080
the match that lights the flame. So the capacity for war was brewing within the leaders and within

02:08.080 --> 02:14.640
the populace. They started accepting slowly through the culture propagated this idea

02:15.600 --> 02:23.840
that we can go to war. It's a good idea to go to war. It's a good idea to expand and dominate

02:23.840 --> 02:28.640
others, that kind of thing. Maybe not put in those clear terms, but just the sense

02:28.640 --> 02:33.040
that military action is the way that nations operate at the global scale.

02:34.240 --> 02:40.480
Yes. Yes and, right. So yes, there's a sense that the military can be the solution to political

02:40.480 --> 02:47.040
conflict in Europe itself. And the end is that war and military conflict are already happening,

02:47.040 --> 02:52.320
right? That there's war, particularly in Africa, in North Africa, in the Middle East,

02:53.040 --> 02:59.520
Balkans. Conflict is already underway and the European powers haven't faced off against each

02:59.520 --> 03:04.560
other. They've usually faced off against an asymmetrical conflict against much less powerful

03:04.640 --> 03:08.880
states. But in some ways that war is already underway.

03:09.600 --> 03:16.240
So do you think it was inevitable? Because World War I is brought up as a case study where it

03:16.240 --> 03:24.320
seems like a few accidental leaders and a few accidental events or one accidental event led

03:24.320 --> 03:29.200
to the war. And if you change that one little thing, it could have avoided the war. Your sense is

03:30.160 --> 03:35.600
that the drums of war have been beating for quite a while and it would have happened almost no

03:35.600 --> 03:40.560
matter what or very likely to have happened. Yes. Historians never like to say things are

03:40.560 --> 03:45.680
inevitable. And certainly, there were people who could have chosen a different path,

03:45.680 --> 03:52.960
both in the short term and the long term. But fundamentally, there were irreconcilable conflicts

03:52.960 --> 03:59.920
in the system of empires in the world in 1914. It didn't have to be this war,

03:59.920 --> 04:04.080
but it probably had to be a war. So there was the German Empire,

04:04.080 --> 04:12.080
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, there was France and Great Britain, US. The USP called that empire

04:12.080 --> 04:20.080
at that moment yet. When do you graduate to empire status? Well, certainly after 1898 with

04:20.080 --> 04:24.480
the acquisition of the former territories of the Spanish Empire. The United States has formal

04:24.480 --> 04:31.680
colonial possessions and it has sort of mindsets of rule and military acquisition that would define

04:32.240 --> 04:36.720
empire in a kind of more informal sense. So you would say you would put the blame

04:38.240 --> 04:43.600
or the responsibility of starting World War I into the hands of the German Empire

04:43.600 --> 04:52.720
and Kaiser Wilhelm II? That's a really tough call to make. Deciding that is going to keep

04:52.720 --> 05:01.360
historians in business for the next 200 years. I think there are people who would lay all of the

05:01.360 --> 05:09.840
blame on the Germans, who would point toward a generation of arms buildup, alliances that

05:09.920 --> 05:16.240
Germany made and promises that they made to their allies in the Balkans, to the Austro-Hungarians.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.840
So yes, there's an awful lot of responsibility there. There has been a trend lately to say,

05:24.800 --> 05:32.080
no, it's no one's fault that all of the various powers literally were sleepwalking into the war.

05:32.720 --> 05:38.000
They backed into it inadvertently. I think that lets everyone a little too much off the hook.

05:38.320 --> 05:45.600
And so I think in between is I would put the blame on the system of empires itself, on the system.

05:46.240 --> 05:50.640
But in that system, the actor that sort of carries the most responsibility

05:50.640 --> 05:57.040
is definitely Imperial Germany. So the leader of Austro-Hungarian Empire,

05:57.040 --> 06:02.480
Franz Joseph I, his nephew, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, he was assassinated.

06:03.120 --> 06:13.360
And so that didn't have to lead to a war. And then the leader of the German Empire,

06:13.360 --> 06:26.400
Kaiser Wilhelm II, started talking trash and boiling the water that ultimately resulted in

06:27.360 --> 06:33.840
the explosion, plus all the other players. So can you describe the dynamics of how that unrolled?

06:35.040 --> 06:38.880
What's the role of the US? What's the role of France? What's the role of Great Britain,

06:38.880 --> 06:45.040
Germany, and Austro-Hungarian Empire? Yeah. Over the course of about four weeks,

06:45.040 --> 06:52.320
following the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo, it sort of triggers a series of

06:53.120 --> 07:02.000
political conflicts and ultimately ultimatums demanding that one or other power stand down

07:02.000 --> 07:09.520
in response to the demands of either Britain, France, or in turn, Germany or Russia,

07:09.520 --> 07:15.440
at the same time that those alliances trigger automatic responses from the other side.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.680
And so it escalates. And once that escalation is combined with the call up of military troops,

07:22.320 --> 07:29.600
then none of those powers wants to be the last one to get ready for conflict. So even throughout

07:29.600 --> 07:36.560
it, they think they are getting ready in a defensive maneuver. And they think if there

07:36.560 --> 07:43.760
is conflict, well, it might be a skirmish. It might be a standoff. It could be solved with

07:43.760 --> 07:51.120
diplomacy later because diplomacy is failing now. That turns out not to be the case. Diplomacy fails.

07:51.120 --> 07:55.600
It's not a skirmish. It becomes a massive war. And the Americans are watching all of this from

07:55.600 --> 08:00.640
the sidelines. They have very little influence over what happens that summer. How does it go

08:00.640 --> 08:07.760
from a skirmish between a few nations to a global war? Is there a place where there's a phase

08:07.760 --> 08:13.440
transition? Yeah. I think the phase transition is over the course of the fall of 1914,

08:14.320 --> 08:20.320
when the Germans make an initial sort of bold move into France. In many ways, they're fighting

08:20.320 --> 08:30.320
the last war, the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. And they really do sort of want to have a quick

08:30.320 --> 08:36.080
sort of lightning strike in some ways against France to kind of bring the war to a speedy

08:36.080 --> 08:42.960
conclusion. France turns out to be able to fight back more effectively than the Germans expected.

08:43.920 --> 08:52.800
And then the battle lines sort of harden. And then behind that, the French and the Germans,

08:52.800 --> 09:00.640
as well as the British on the side of the French, start digging in, literally. And digging trenches,

09:00.640 --> 09:07.920
trenches that at first are three feet deep to avoid shelling from artillery, then become six

09:07.920 --> 09:14.400
feet, 10 feet deep, two miles wide, that include telegraph wires, that include whole hospitals in

09:14.400 --> 09:21.600
the back. And then at that point, the front is locked in place. And the only way to break that

09:21.600 --> 09:28.320
is sort of basically dialing the war up to 11, massive numbers of troops, massive efforts,

09:29.280 --> 09:35.120
none of which work. And so the war is stuck in this. But that's the phase transition right there.

09:36.080 --> 09:41.920
What were the machines of war in that case? You mentioned trenches. What were the guns used?

09:43.040 --> 09:49.920
What was the size of guns? What are we talking about? What did Germany start accumulating that

09:49.920 --> 09:57.280
led up to this war? One of the things that we see immediately is the Industrial Revolution of the

09:57.760 --> 10:05.600
previous 30 or 40 years brought to bear on warfare. And so you see sort of machine guns,

10:05.600 --> 10:13.920
you see artillery. These are the key weapons of war on both sides. The vast majority of

10:13.920 --> 10:21.520
battlefield casualties are from artillery shelling from one side to another, not sort of rifle or

10:21.520 --> 10:28.640
even sort of machine gun kind of attacks. In some ways, the weapons of war are human beings.

10:29.680 --> 10:36.080
Tens of thousands of them poured over the top in these sort of waves to kind of try to break

10:36.080 --> 10:42.160
through the enemy lines. And it would work for a little while, but holding the territory that

10:42.160 --> 10:48.800
had been gained often proved to be even more demanding than gaining it. And so often each

10:48.800 --> 10:52.400
side would retreat back into the trenches and wait for another day.

10:53.360 --> 11:01.840
And how did Russia, how did Britain, how did France get pulled into the war? I suppose the

11:01.840 --> 11:08.400
France one is the easy one. But what is the order of events here? How it becomes a global war?

11:08.400 --> 11:17.440
Yeah. So Britain, France, and Russia are at this time in their alliance. And so the conflicts in

11:17.440 --> 11:23.120
the summer of 1914 that lead sort of to the declarations of war happen sort of one after

11:23.120 --> 11:30.400
another in late August of 1914. And all three powers essentially come in at the same time

11:31.040 --> 11:37.520
because they have promised to do so through a series of alliances conducted secretly in the

11:37.520 --> 11:44.160
years before 1914 that committed them to defend one another. Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the

11:44.160 --> 11:50.240
Ottoman Empire have their own sort of set of secret agreements that also commit them to defend

11:50.240 --> 11:56.400
one another. And what this does is it sort of brings them all into conflict at the exact same

11:56.400 --> 12:01.760
moment. They're also, for many of these countries, bringing not just their national armies,

12:02.320 --> 12:08.320
but also their empires into the conflict. So Britain and France, of course, have enormous

12:08.320 --> 12:14.880
sort of global empires. They begin mobilizing soldiers as well as raw materials. Germany has

12:14.880 --> 12:19.440
less of an overseas empire. Russia and the Ottoman Empire, of course, have their own sort of

12:19.440 --> 12:25.680
hinterland within the empire. And very soon sort of all of the warring powers are bringing the

12:25.680 --> 12:31.920
entire world into the conflict. Did they have a sense of how deadly the war is? I mean, this is

12:31.920 --> 12:39.440
another scale of death and destruction. At the beginning, no, but very quickly.

12:40.080 --> 12:45.840
The scale of the devastation of these sort of massive over-the-top attacks on trenches is

12:45.840 --> 12:50.720
apparent to the military officers, and it very quickly becomes apparent even at home.

12:51.840 --> 12:56.960
There is, of course, censorship of the battlefield, and specific details don't reach people.

12:57.600 --> 13:04.640
But for civilians in any of the warring powers, they know fairly soon how destructive the war is.

13:05.760 --> 13:12.320
And to me, that's always been a real sort of puzzle, that by the time the United States

13:12.320 --> 13:18.160
comes to decide whether to join the war in 1917, they know exactly what they're getting into.

13:18.160 --> 13:24.160
They're not backing into the war in the ways that the European powers did. They've seen the

13:24.160 --> 13:30.000
devastation, they've seen photographs, they've seen injured soldiers, and they make that choice

13:30.000 --> 13:39.600
anyway. When you say they, do you mean the leaders of the people? Did the death and destruction reach

13:39.600 --> 13:47.520
the minds of the American people by that time? Yes, absolutely. We don't in 1917 have the mass

13:47.520 --> 13:53.840
media that we have now, but there are images in newspapers, there are newsreels that play

13:53.840 --> 14:02.000
at the movie theaters, and of course, some of it is sanitized. But that, combined with press accounts,

14:02.000 --> 14:09.280
often really quite descriptive press accounts, gory accounts, reached anyone who cared to read

14:09.280 --> 14:14.560
them. Certainly, plenty of people didn't follow the news, felt it was far away. But most Americans

14:14.560 --> 14:19.680
who cared about the news knew how devastating this war was. Yeah, there's something that happens

14:20.320 --> 14:28.400
that I recently visited Ukraine for a few weeks. There's something that happens with the human mind

14:28.400 --> 14:36.560
as you get away from the actual front where the bullets are flying, literally one kilometer away.

14:36.560 --> 14:42.560
You start to not feel the war. You'll hear an explosion, you'll see an explosion, you start to

14:42.560 --> 14:48.240
get assimilated to it, or you start to get used to it. And then when you get as far away from

14:48.240 --> 14:54.960
currently what is Kiev, you start to, you know the war's going on, everybody around you is fighting

14:54.960 --> 15:01.840
in that war, but it's still somehow distant. And I think with the United States, with the ocean between,

15:02.960 --> 15:08.000
even if you have the stories everywhere, it still is somehow distant, like the way a movie is.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.160
Maybe, yeah, like a movie or a video game, it's somewhere else. Even if your loved ones are going,

15:16.240 --> 15:20.960
or you are going to fight. Yeah, that is absolutely the case. And in some ways,

15:20.960 --> 15:26.800
that's true even for the home fronts in Europe, except for the areas where in Belgium and France,

15:26.800 --> 15:33.200
where the war is right there in your backyard. For other people, yeah, there's a distance.

15:33.200 --> 15:38.640
And soldiers, of course, feel this very strongly. European soldiers, when they're able to go home

15:38.640 --> 15:47.520
on leave, often, you know, deeply present what they see as the luxury that civilians are living

15:47.520 --> 15:54.640
in during the war. So how did US enter the war? Who was the president? What was the dynamics

15:54.640 --> 16:02.160
involved? And could it have stayed out? To answer your last question first, yes,

16:02.960 --> 16:06.800
that the United States could have stayed out of the First World War

16:08.720 --> 16:15.120
as a military power. The United States could not have ignored the war completely. It shaped

16:15.120 --> 16:23.440
everything. It shaped trade, it shaped goods and services, agriculture, whether there was a crop

16:23.440 --> 16:28.480
coming, whether there were immigrants coming across the Atlantic to work in American factories.

16:28.720 --> 16:34.720
So the US can't ignore the war. But the US makes a choice in 1917 to enter the war

16:35.360 --> 16:44.080
by declaring war on Germany and Austria. And in that sense, this is a war of choice,

16:44.080 --> 16:50.880
but it's kicked off by a series of events. So President Woodrow Wilson has been president

16:50.880 --> 16:58.640
through this entire period of time. He has just run in the 1916 presidential election on a campaign

16:58.640 --> 17:05.440
to keep the United States out of war. But then in early 1917, the Germans, in some ways,

17:06.320 --> 17:13.440
twist the Americans' arms. The Germans' high command comes to understand that they're stuck.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.800
They're stuck in this trench warfare. They need a big breakthrough. Their one big chance is to

17:21.760 --> 17:29.200
to break the blockade that the British have imposed on them, to break through against

17:30.240 --> 17:36.560
France. And so they do. And along with this, they start sinking ships on the Atlantic,

17:36.560 --> 17:41.920
including American ships. The Germans know full well this will draw the United States into war.

17:42.640 --> 17:48.560
But the Germans look at the United States at this moment, a relatively small army, a relatively

17:48.560 --> 17:54.160
small navy, a country that, at least on paper, is deeply divided about whether to join the war.

17:54.960 --> 18:00.800
And so they say, let's do it. They're not going to get any American soldiers there in time.

18:02.320 --> 18:10.640
It was a gamble, but I think probably their best chance. They took that gamble. They lost,

18:10.640 --> 18:16.400
in part because French resistance was strong, in part because Americans mobilized much faster and

18:16.400 --> 18:21.040
in much greater numbers than the Germans thought they would. So the American people were divided.

18:21.040 --> 18:27.040
The American people were absolutely divided about whether to enter this war. From 1914 to 1917,

18:27.040 --> 18:32.640
there is a searing debate across the political spectrum. It doesn't break down easily on party

18:32.640 --> 18:38.480
lines about whether it was in the US interest to do this, whether American troops should be sent

18:38.480 --> 18:46.400
abroad, whether Americans would end up just being cannon fodder for the European empires.

18:47.360 --> 18:54.720
Eventually, as American ships are sunk, first in the Lusitania in 1915, then in much greater

18:54.720 --> 19:02.080
numbers in 1917, the tide starts to turn and Americans feel that a response is necessary.

19:02.080 --> 19:07.600
And the actual declaration of war in Congress is pretty lopsided, but it's not unanimous by any

19:07.600 --> 19:14.560
means. Lopsided towards entering the war. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's really interesting

19:15.840 --> 19:22.080
because there's echoes of that in later wars where Congress seems to...

19:22.960 --> 19:28.320
Nobody wants to be the guy that says no to war for some reason. Once you sense that,

19:29.440 --> 19:35.680
in terms of, sorry, in terms of the politicians, because then you appear weak, but I wonder if

19:35.680 --> 19:41.840
that was always the case. So you make the case that World War I is largely responsible for

19:42.960 --> 19:50.400
defining what it means to be an American citizen. So in which way does it define the American

19:50.400 --> 19:55.920
citizen? When you think about citizenship, what it means is two things. First of all,

19:55.920 --> 20:02.240
what are your rights and obligations? What is the legal citizenship that you have as a citizen of

20:02.240 --> 20:08.240
the United States or any other state? And the second is a more amorphous definition of what

20:08.240 --> 20:15.440
does it mean to belong, to be part of America, to feel American, to love it or hate it or be

20:15.440 --> 20:22.160
willing to die for it. And both of those things really are crystal clear in terms of their

20:22.160 --> 20:29.760
importance during the war. So both of those things are on the table. Being a citizen who is a citizen

20:29.760 --> 20:36.720
who isn't matters. So people who had never carried passports or anything before suddenly have to.

20:37.680 --> 20:42.880
But also what it means to be an American, to feel like it, to be part of this project,

20:42.880 --> 20:46.640
is also being defined and enforced during World War I.

20:46.640 --> 20:54.800
So project is a funny way to put a global war. So can you tell the story? Perhaps that's a good

20:54.800 --> 21:04.320
example of it, of the James Montgomery Flagg's 1916 poster that reads, I want you. A lot of

21:04.320 --> 21:10.160
people know this poster. I think in its original form or its memeified form, I don't know. But

21:10.160 --> 21:16.560
we know this poster and we don't know where it came from. Or most Americas, I think, me included,

21:16.560 --> 21:21.920
didn't know where it came from. And it actually comes from 1916. Does this poster represent

21:22.480 --> 21:33.280
the birth of something new in America, which is a commodification or, I don't know, that propaganda

21:33.280 --> 21:39.120
machine that says what it means to be an American is somebody that fights for their country?

21:40.240 --> 21:46.640
Yeah. In fact, I think one of the most recognizable images, not only in the United States,

21:46.640 --> 21:54.080
but in the entire world. And you can bring it almost anywhere on earth in 2022 and people

21:54.080 --> 22:00.800
will know what it refers to. And so this is an image that circulated first as a magazine cover,

22:00.800 --> 22:07.520
later as a recruitment poster, where the figure is Uncle Sam pointing at the viewer with his

22:07.520 --> 22:14.960
finger pointing and saying, I want you. And the I want you is a recruitment tool to join the U.S.

22:14.960 --> 22:22.960
Army. And this image really kind of starts as a kind of, like I said, a magazine cover in 1916

22:22.960 --> 22:28.720
by the artist James Montgomery Flagg. It initially appears under the heading, what are you doing for

22:28.720 --> 22:35.360
preparedness? Meaning to prepare in case war comes to the United States. And at that point in 1916,

22:35.360 --> 22:42.080
we're still neutral. In 1917, it's turned into a U.S. Army recruiting poster.

22:43.040 --> 22:48.960
And then it reappears in World War II, reappears generations after. Like you said, it's now

22:49.600 --> 22:58.240
gets remixed, memified. It's all over the place. I think for me, it's a turning point. It's a sort

22:58.240 --> 23:04.720
of window into American culture at a crucial moment in our history where the federal government

23:04.720 --> 23:11.040
is now embarking on a war overseas that's going to make enormous demands on its citizens. And at

23:11.040 --> 23:17.920
the same time, where sort of technologies of mass production and mass media and what we would

23:17.920 --> 23:24.960
probably call propaganda are being sort of mobilized for the first time in this new kind of way.

23:24.960 --> 23:33.600
Well, in some sense, is it fair to say that the empire is born, the expanding empire is born

23:33.600 --> 23:40.640
from the Noam Chomsky perspective kind of empire that seeks to have military influence elsewhere

23:40.640 --> 23:47.280
in the world? Yes. But I think as historians, we need to be at least as interested in what happens

23:47.280 --> 23:52.800
to the people who are getting pointed to by Uncle Sam, right? Rather than just the one, you know,

23:52.800 --> 23:59.040
whether he's pointing at us. And, you know, so yes, he's asking us to do that. But how do we respond?

23:59.760 --> 24:06.080
And the people responded. So the people are ultimately the machines of history,

24:06.720 --> 24:11.760
the mechanisms of history. It's not the Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam can only do so much if the people

24:11.760 --> 24:16.080
aren't willing to step up. Absolutely. And, you know, the American people responded for sure,

24:16.080 --> 24:22.320
but they didn't build what Uncle Sam asked them to do in that poster, right? And I think that's,

24:22.320 --> 24:27.200
you know, kind of a crucial aspect that, you know, there never would have been sort of

24:27.600 --> 24:32.880
global U.S. power without the response that begins in World War I. What was the Selective

24:32.880 --> 24:38.400
Service Act of 1917? So one of the very first things that Uncle Sam wants you to do, right,

24:38.400 --> 24:44.560
is to register for selective service, for the draft, right? And the laws passed very soon after

24:44.560 --> 24:51.840
the U.S. enters the war. It's sort of, you know, demanding that all men, first between 21 and 30,

24:51.840 --> 24:59.040
then between 18 and 45, register for the draft and they'll be selected by a government agency,

24:59.040 --> 25:02.080
by a volunteer organization. So it's a requirement to sign up.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.880
It is a legal requirement to register. Of course, not everyone who registers is selected,

25:08.080 --> 25:12.960
but over the course of the war, 24 million men register, almost 4 million

25:12.960 --> 25:18.080
serve in some fashion. What was the response? What was the feeling amongst the American people

25:18.080 --> 25:23.040
to have to sign up to the Selective Service Act, have to register?

25:23.040 --> 25:30.080
Yeah. This is a bigger turning point than we might think, right? In some ways, this is a tougher

25:30.080 --> 25:34.800
demand of the American public than entering the war. It's one thing to declare war on Germany,

25:34.800 --> 25:41.040
right? It's another thing to go down to your local post office and fill out the forms that allow

25:41.040 --> 25:46.720
your own government to send you there to fight. And this is especially important at a time when

25:46.720 --> 25:53.040
the federal government doesn't really have any other way to find you, unless you actually go

25:53.040 --> 25:59.200
and register yourself, right? And so, you know, ordinary people are participating in the building

25:59.200 --> 26:05.520
of this war machine, but at least a half a million of them don't, right? And simply never fill out

26:05.520 --> 26:10.800
the forms, move from one town to another. But you said 20 million did? 20 something?

26:10.800 --> 26:14.640
Yeah. About 24 million register, at least 500,000.

26:14.640 --> 26:19.120
Is it surprising to you that that many registered since the country was divided?

26:19.680 --> 26:25.280
It is. And that's what I sort of tried to dig in to figure out, how did you get 24 million people

26:25.280 --> 26:31.520
to register for the draft? And it's certainly not coming from the top down, right? There may be a

26:31.520 --> 26:38.160
hundred sort of agents in what's now called the FBI. It's certainly not being enforced from

26:38.160 --> 26:42.880
Washington. It's being enforced in, you know, through the eyes of everyday neighbors,

26:43.840 --> 26:46.640
through community surveillance, all kinds of ways.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.880
Oh, so there was like a pressure.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.280
There's a lot of pressure.

26:51.280 --> 26:58.240
Interesting. So there was not a significant like anti-war movement as you would see maybe

26:59.120 --> 27:00.880
later with Vietnam and things like this.

27:01.600 --> 27:08.560
There was a significant movement before 1917, but it becomes very hard to keep up an organized

27:08.560 --> 27:12.640
anti-war movement after that, particularly when the government starts shutting down protests.

27:13.440 --> 27:20.960
So as the Selective Service Act of 1917 runs up against some of the freedoms,

27:20.960 --> 27:29.040
some of the rights that are defined in our founding documents, what was that clash like?

27:29.040 --> 27:34.240
What was sacrificed? What freedoms and rights were sacrificed in this process?

27:35.280 --> 27:41.280
I mean, I think on some level, the fundamental right is liberty, right? That conscription

27:41.280 --> 27:50.000
sort of demands, you know, sacrifice on the behalf of some notionally for the protection of all.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.520
So even if you're against the war, you're forced to fight.

27:53.520 --> 28:00.320
Yes. And there were small provisions for conscientious objectors, solely those who

28:00.320 --> 28:06.880
had religious objections to all war, right? Not political objections to this war. And so

28:06.880 --> 28:12.800
several thousand were able to take those provisions. But even then, they faced social

28:12.800 --> 28:19.280
sanction. They faced ridicule. Some of them faced intimidation. So those liberty interests,

28:19.280 --> 28:23.280
both individual freedom, religious freedom, you know, those are some of the first things to go.

28:25.280 --> 28:31.440
So what about freedom of speech? What's the silencing of the press,

28:31.440 --> 28:34.160
of the voices of the different people that were object?

28:34.880 --> 28:39.120
Yes, absolutely. Right. And so very soon after the Selective Service Act is passed,

28:39.120 --> 28:43.920
then you get the Espionage Act, which of course is back in the news in 2022.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.200
What's the Espionage Act?

28:45.200 --> 28:49.440
The Espionage Act is a sort of omnibus bill. It contains about 10 or different provisions,

28:49.440 --> 28:55.920
very few of which have to do with espionage. But one key provision basically makes it illegal

28:55.920 --> 29:02.080
to say or do anything that would interfere with military recruitment, right? And that

29:02.080 --> 29:07.280
provision is used to shut down radical publications, to shut down German language

29:07.280 --> 29:12.720
publications. And, you know, this really has a chilling impact on speech during the war.

29:12.720 --> 29:20.960
Could you put into words what it means to be an American citizen that is in part sparked by World

29:20.960 --> 29:31.200
War I? What does that mean? Somebody that should be willing to sacrifice certain freedoms to fight

29:31.200 --> 29:39.840
for their country? Somebody that's willing to fight to spread freedom elsewhere in the world,

29:40.480 --> 29:47.520
spread the American ideals? Does that begin to tell the story what it means to be an American?

29:49.440 --> 29:55.040
I think what we see is a change, right? So citizenship during World War I now includes

29:56.400 --> 30:03.840
the obligation to defend the country, right? To serve and to, if asked, to die for it, right?

30:04.800 --> 30:11.680
And we certainly see that. And I think we see the close linkage of military service and US

30:11.680 --> 30:17.840
citizenship coming out of this time period. But, you know, when you start making lots of demands

30:17.840 --> 30:22.080
on people to fulfill obligations, in turn, they're going to start demanding rights.

30:22.960 --> 30:28.480
And we start to see not necessarily during the war, but after, more demands for free speech

30:28.480 --> 30:34.160
protections, more demands for equality, for marginalized groups. And so, you know,

30:34.160 --> 30:38.240
obligations and rights are sort of developing in a dynamic relationship.

30:38.240 --> 30:45.920
Oh, it's almost like an overreach of power sparked a sense like, oh, crap, we can't trust

30:45.920 --> 30:52.960
centralized power to, like, to drag us into a war. We need to be able to. So there's the birth of

30:52.960 --> 30:58.080
that tension between the government and the people. It's a rebirth of it. You know, of course,

30:58.480 --> 31:03.600
that tension is always there. But in its modern form, I think it comes from this re-intensification

31:03.600 --> 31:08.240
of it. Yeah. So what about the, you said that World War I gave birth to the surveillance state

31:08.240 --> 31:14.400
in the US. Can you explain? Yeah. So the Espionage Act, you know, sort of empowers

31:15.040 --> 31:21.520
federal organizations to watch other Americans. They are particularly interested in anyone who

31:21.600 --> 31:29.600
is obstructing the draft, anyone who is trying to kind of organize labor or strikes or radical

31:29.600 --> 31:35.120
movements, and anyone who might have sympathy for Germany, which basically means, you know,

31:35.120 --> 31:40.720
all German Americans come under surveillance. Initially, you know, this is very small scale,

31:42.080 --> 31:47.520
but soon every government agency gets involved from the Treasury Department's Secret Service

31:47.520 --> 31:53.040
to the post office, which is sort of reading mail to the Justice Department, which mobilizes

31:53.040 --> 31:59.280
200,000 volunteers. You know, it's a really significant enterprise. Much of it goes away

31:59.280 --> 32:04.960
after the war. But of all the things that go away, this core of the surveillance state is the thing

32:04.960 --> 32:14.000
that persists most fully. Is this also a place where government, the size of government starts

32:14.000 --> 32:19.680
to grow in these different organizations, or maybe creates a momentum for growth of government?

32:19.680 --> 32:25.600
Oh, it's exponential growth, right? That, you know, that over the course of the war,

32:26.240 --> 32:31.600
by almost any metric you use, right, the size of the federal budget, the number of federal employees,

32:31.600 --> 32:36.080
the number of soldiers in the standing army, all of those things skyrocket during the war.

32:36.080 --> 32:40.160
They go down after the war, but they never go down to what they were before.

32:40.960 --> 32:44.640
And probably gave a momentum for growth over time.

32:44.640 --> 32:45.600
Yes, absolutely.

32:47.120 --> 32:53.120
Did World War I give birth to the military industrial complex in the United States? So,

32:55.600 --> 33:04.160
war profiteering, expanding of the war machine in order to financially benefit a lot of parties

33:04.160 --> 33:13.040
involved. So, I guess I would maybe break that into two parts, right? On the one hand, yes,

33:14.160 --> 33:20.800
there is war profiteering. There are investigations of it. In the years after the war,

33:20.800 --> 33:28.480
there's a widespread concern that the profit motive had played too much of a part in the war,

33:28.480 --> 33:33.040
and that's definitely the case. But I think when you try to think of this term,

33:33.040 --> 33:40.640
military industrial complex, it's best to think of it as at what point does the one side lock in

33:40.640 --> 33:47.760
the other, right? That military choices are shaped by industry objectives and vice versa.

33:48.560 --> 33:53.440
And I don't think that that was fully locked into place during World War I. I think that's really a

33:53.440 --> 33:59.760
Cold War phenomenon when the United States is on this intense kind of footing for two generations

33:59.760 --> 34:05.520
in a row. So, industrial is really important there, that is companies. So, before then,

34:07.120 --> 34:14.320
weapons of war were funded directly by the government. Who was manufacturing the weapons

34:14.320 --> 34:20.240
of war? They were generally manufactured by private industry. There were, of course,

34:21.360 --> 34:26.640
arsenals, sort of 19th century iterations where the government would produce its own weapons,

34:26.640 --> 34:32.560
partly to make sure that they got what they wanted. But most of the weapons of war for all

34:32.560 --> 34:37.120
of the European powers and the United States are produced by private industry.

34:37.120 --> 34:42.960
So, why do you say that the military industrial complex didn't start then? What was the important

34:42.960 --> 34:47.840
thing that happened in the Cold War? I think one way to think about it is

34:48.880 --> 34:54.320
the Cold War is a point at which it switches from being a dial to a ratchet, right? So,

34:54.320 --> 35:02.240
during World War I, the relationship between the military and industry dials up fast and high

35:02.240 --> 35:09.520
and stays that way and it dials back down. Whereas during the Cold War, the relationship

35:09.520 --> 35:13.680
between the two often looks more like a ratchet. Yeah, it becomes unstoppable.

35:13.680 --> 35:17.280
It goes up again. In the way that you start, I think

35:18.240 --> 35:25.280
the way the military industrial complex is often discussed is as a system that

35:26.400 --> 35:40.160
is unstoppable. It expands. If you take a very cynical view, it creates war so that it can make

35:40.160 --> 35:47.040
money. It doesn't just find places where it can help through military conflict. It

35:47.600 --> 35:54.080
creates tensions that directly or indirectly lead to military conflict that it can then fuel and

35:54.080 --> 36:02.560
make money from. That is certainly one of the concerns of both people who are critical of the

36:02.560 --> 36:09.120
First World War and then also of Dwight Eisenhower when he's president and in his farewell address

36:09.120 --> 36:14.560
where he introduces the term military industrial complex. Some of it is about the profit motive,

36:14.560 --> 36:21.360
but some of it is a fear that Eisenhower had that no one had an interest in stopping this

36:22.160 --> 36:25.680
and that no one had a voice in stopping it and that the ordinary American

36:26.720 --> 36:35.120
could really do nothing to dial things down. Is it strange to you that we don't often hear

36:36.160 --> 36:42.560
that kind of speech today with Eisenhower speaking about the military industrial complex?

36:43.200 --> 36:49.280
For example, we'll have people criticizing the spending on war efforts, but they're not

36:50.160 --> 36:57.840
discussing the machinery of the military industrial complex, like the basic

36:58.560 --> 37:03.600
way that human nature works, whether we get ourselves trapped in this thing. They're saying

37:03.600 --> 37:10.480
there's better things to spend money on versus describing a very seemingly natural process

37:11.360 --> 37:19.120
of when you build weapons of war that's going to lead to more war. It pulls you in somehow.

37:20.400 --> 37:27.840
Yeah. I would say throughout the Cold War and even after the end of it, there has not been a

37:27.840 --> 37:37.200
sustained conversation in the United States about our defense establishment, what we really need

37:38.160 --> 37:48.400
and what serves our interest and to what extent other things like market forces, profit motives,

37:49.520 --> 37:54.800
belong in that conversation. What's interesting is that in the generation after the First World

37:54.800 --> 38:01.840
War, that conversation was on the table through a series of investigations in the US, the NY

38:01.920 --> 38:07.680
Committee in Britain, a royal commission, journalistic exposés. This would have been just

38:08.240 --> 38:14.480
talked about constantly in the years between about 1930 and 1936 as people were starting

38:14.480 --> 38:21.440
to worry that storm clouds were gathering in Europe again. Yeah, but it always seems like

38:21.440 --> 38:31.760
those folks get pushed to the fringes. You're made an activist versus a thinking

38:31.840 --> 38:38.160
leader. Those discussions are often marginalized, framed as conspiracy theory, et cetera.

38:39.840 --> 38:47.280
I think it's important to realize that in the generation after World War I, this was a serious

38:47.280 --> 38:54.640
civic conversation. It led to investigations of defense finance. It led to experiments

38:55.360 --> 39:01.600
in Britain and France and public finance of war material. I think those conversations need to be

39:01.600 --> 39:09.600
reconvened now in the 21st century. Is there any parallels between World War I and the war in

39:09.600 --> 39:20.480
Ukraine? The reason I bring it up is because you mentioned there was a hunger for war,

39:22.160 --> 39:28.080
a capacity for war that was already established, and the different parties were just boiling the

39:29.040 --> 39:36.240
tensions. There's a case made that America had a role to play. NATO had a role to play in the

39:36.240 --> 39:43.920
current war in Ukraine. Is there some truth to that when you think about it in the context of

39:43.920 --> 39:51.040
World War I? Or is it purely about the specific parties involved, which is Russia and Ukraine?

39:51.120 --> 39:59.680
I think it's very easy to draw parallels between World War I and the war in Ukraine,

40:01.920 --> 40:10.560
but I don't think they really work. The First World War in some ways is generated by

40:12.000 --> 40:20.400
a fundamental conflict in the European system of empires, in the global system of empires.

40:21.440 --> 40:27.040
In many ways, if there's a parallel, the war in Ukraine is the parallel to some of the conflicts

40:28.960 --> 40:41.040
in the Mediterranean and the Balkans in 1911 to 1913, that then later there was a much greater

40:41.040 --> 40:49.360
conflict. I think if there's any lessons to be learned for how not to let World War III look like

40:49.360 --> 40:56.640
World War I, it would be to make sure that systems aren't locked into place, that escalate

40:56.640 --> 41:03.680
wars out of people's expectations. That's, I suppose, what I was implying, that this is

41:03.680 --> 41:11.840
the early stages of World War III, that in the same way that several wolves are licking their

41:12.720 --> 41:18.480
chops or whatever the expression is, they're creating tension, they're creating military

41:18.480 --> 41:29.600
conflict with a kind of unstoppable imperative for a global war. Many people that are looking

41:29.600 --> 41:37.280
at this are really worried about that. Now, the stopping, the forcing function to stop this war is

41:37.280 --> 41:43.280
that there's several nuclear powers involved, which has, at least for now, worked to stop

41:44.160 --> 41:49.600
full-on global war, but I'm not sure that's going to be the case. In fact, what is one of the

41:50.640 --> 41:57.200
surprising things to me in Ukraine is that still in the 21st century,

41:58.240 --> 42:04.400
we can go to something that involves nuclear powers, not directly yet, but awfully close to

42:04.400 --> 42:14.480
directly, go to a hot war. Do you worry about that, that there's a kind of descent into a

42:14.480 --> 42:20.560
World War I type of scenario? Yes. That keeps me up at night, and I think it should keep

42:21.600 --> 42:31.680
the citizens of both the United States and Russia up at night. Again, it gets back to what I was

42:31.680 --> 42:40.960
saying, that in the summer of 1914, even then, things that looked like a march toward war

42:42.160 --> 42:50.400
could have been different. I think it's important for leaders of both countries and of all of the

42:50.400 --> 42:58.560
related countries, of Ukraine, of the various NATO powers, to really imagine off-ramps and to imagine

42:58.560 --> 43:06.320
alternatives and to make them possible, whether it's through diplomacy, whether it's through

43:06.320 --> 43:14.560
other formats. I think that's the only way to prevent greater escalation.

43:15.360 --> 43:20.160
What's the difference between World War I and the Civil War, in terms of how they defined what it

43:20.160 --> 43:28.400
means to be an American, but also the American citizen's relationship with the war, what the

43:28.400 --> 43:35.680
leaders were doing? Is there interesting differences and similarities, besides the fact that everybody

43:35.680 --> 43:39.840
seems to have forgot about World War I in the United States, and everyone still remembers Civil

43:39.840 --> 43:50.880
War? It's true. The American Civil War defines American identity in some ways, along with the

43:50.880 --> 43:58.800
Revolution and the Second World War, more so than any other conflict. It's a fundamentally different

43:58.800 --> 44:07.120
war. It's one because it is a civil war, because of secession, because of the Confederacy.

44:08.080 --> 44:14.160
This is a conflict happening on the territory of the United States between Americans,

44:14.160 --> 44:21.600
and so the dynamics are really quite different. The leaders, particularly Lincoln, have a different

44:21.600 --> 44:29.120
relationship to the home front, to civilians, than they then say Wilson or Roosevelt have in World

44:29.120 --> 44:34.640
War I and II. Also, the way you would tell the story of the Civil War, perhaps similar to the way

44:34.640 --> 44:40.560
we tell the story of World War II, there's a reason to actually fight the war. The way we tell

44:40.560 --> 44:47.680
the stories, we're fighting for this idea that all men are created equal, that the war is over slavery

44:48.560 --> 44:56.080
in part. Perhaps that's a drastic oversimplification of what the war was actually about

44:56.080 --> 45:02.640
in the moment. How do you get pulled into an actual war versus a hot discussion?

45:03.600 --> 45:09.840
And the same with World War II, people kind of frame the narrative that it was against evil,

45:10.960 --> 45:18.480
Hitler being evil. I think the key part of that is probably the Holocaust. That's how you can

45:18.480 --> 45:23.280
formulate Hitler's being evil. If there's no Holocaust, perhaps there's a case to be made

45:23.280 --> 45:31.920
that we wouldn't see World War II as such, quote unquote, good war, that there's an atrocity that

45:32.400 --> 45:38.720
had to happen to make it really, to be able to tell a clear narrative of why we get into this war.

45:38.720 --> 45:44.480
Perhaps such a narrative doesn't exist for World War I, and so that doesn't stay in the American

45:44.480 --> 45:54.080
mind. We try to sweep it under the rug, given though overall 16 million people died. So to you,

45:54.080 --> 46:01.680
the difference is in the fact that you're fighting for ideas and fighting on the homeland,

46:01.680 --> 46:09.840
but in terms of people's participation fighting for your country, was there similarities there?

46:10.960 --> 46:19.440
Yeah. I think the Civil War in both the North and the South, troops are raised overwhelmingly

46:19.440 --> 46:24.560
through volunteer recruitment. There is a draft in both the North and the South, but

46:24.560 --> 46:33.440
it's not significant. Only 8% of Confederate soldiers came in through conscription.

46:35.920 --> 46:44.720
In fact, the mobilization for volunteers, often organized locally around individual communities

46:44.720 --> 46:51.520
or states, creates multiple identities and levels of loyalty, where people both in the North and

46:51.520 --> 46:57.200
the South have loyalty both to their state regiments, to their community militias, and

46:57.200 --> 47:02.320
as well to the country. They are fighting over the country, over the United States.

47:03.920 --> 47:09.040
The Union and the Confederacy have conflicting and ultimately irreconcilable visions of that,

47:10.000 --> 47:17.760
but that nationalism that comes out of the Union after the victory and the war

47:17.840 --> 47:20.960
is a kind of crucial force shaping America ever since.

47:21.920 --> 47:26.480
What was the neutrality period? Why did the U.S. stay out of the war for so long? What was going

47:26.480 --> 47:36.880
on in that interesting, what made Woodrow Wilson change his mind? What was the interesting dynamic

47:36.880 --> 47:45.520
there? I always say that the United States entered the war in April of 1917, but Americans entered

47:45.520 --> 47:52.240
it right away. They entered it. Some of them actually went and volunteered and fought almost

47:52.240 --> 47:59.920
exclusively on the side of Britain and France. At least 50,000 joined the Canadian Army or the

47:59.920 --> 48:07.040
British Army and served. Millions volunteered. They sent humanitarian aid. I think in many ways,

48:07.040 --> 48:12.800
modern war creates modern humanitarianism, and we can see that in the neutrality period.

48:13.760 --> 48:19.600
And even if they wanted the United States to stay out of the war, a lot of Americans get involved

48:19.600 --> 48:25.920
in it by thinking about it, caring about it, arguing about it. At the same time, they're

48:25.920 --> 48:33.840
worried that British propaganda is shaping their news system. They are worried that German espionage

48:33.840 --> 48:38.880
is undermining them. They're worried that both Britain and Germany are trying to interfere in

48:38.880 --> 48:45.680
American elections and American news cycles. At the same time, a revolution is breaking out

48:45.680 --> 48:51.360
in Mexico. There are concerns about what's happening in the Western Hemisphere as well

48:51.360 --> 48:57.040
as what's happening in Europe. World War I was supposed to be the war to end all wars,

48:58.400 --> 49:08.560
and it didn't. How did World War I pave the way to World War II? Every nation probably has their

49:08.560 --> 49:15.440
own story in this trajectory towards World War II. How did Europe allow World War II to happen?

49:16.080 --> 49:21.920
How did the Soviet Union, Russia allow World War II to happen, and how did America allow

49:21.920 --> 49:27.040
World War II to happen? And Japan? Yeah, you're right. The answer is different for each country.

49:28.080 --> 49:34.800
That in some ways, in Germany, the culture of defeat and the experience of defeat at the end

49:34.800 --> 49:44.000
of World War I leads to a culture of resentment, recrimination, finger-pointing blame that makes

49:44.000 --> 49:50.720
German politics very ugly. As one person puts it, it brutalizes German politics.

49:51.840 --> 49:56.240
It places resentment at the core of the populace and its politics.

49:56.240 --> 50:02.880
Yeah. In some ways, that lays the groundwork for the kind of politics of resentment and hate

50:03.200 --> 50:09.520
that comes from the Nazis. For the United States, in some ways, the failure to win the peace

50:11.520 --> 50:18.720
sets up the possibility for the next war. That the United States, through Wilson,

50:18.720 --> 50:24.880
is sort of crafting a new international order in order that this will be the war to end all wars.

50:24.880 --> 50:30.720
But because the United States failed to join the League of Nations, you see the United States

50:30.720 --> 50:35.920
really sort of on the hook for another generation. In Asia, the story is more complicated,

50:36.560 --> 50:42.480
and I think it's worth bearing that in mind that World War II is a two-front war. It starts in Asia

50:42.480 --> 50:49.600
for its own reasons. World War I is transformative for Japan. It is a time of massive economic

50:49.600 --> 50:57.200
expansion. A lot of that economic wealth is poured into greater industrialization and

50:57.200 --> 51:04.240
militarization. When the military wing in Japanese politics takes over in the 1930s,

51:04.240 --> 51:08.560
there are, in some ways, flexing muscles that come out of the First World War.

51:09.440 --> 51:16.080
Can you talk about the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles? What's interesting about

51:16.080 --> 51:25.040
that dynamics there, of the parties involved, of how it could have been done differently to avoid

51:25.040 --> 51:34.080
the resentment? Or again, is it inevitable? The war ends, and very soon, even before the war

51:34.080 --> 51:41.440
is over, the United States in particular is trying to shape the peace. The United States is the

51:41.440 --> 51:48.080
central actor at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Woodrow Wilson is there. He's presiding,

51:48.880 --> 51:52.800
and he knows that he calls the shots. He was respected.

51:52.800 --> 52:00.480
He was respected but resentfully, in some ways, by the European powers, Britain and France and

52:00.480 --> 52:07.360
Italy to a lesser extent, who felt that they had sacrificed more. They had two goals. They wanted

52:07.360 --> 52:14.080
to shape the imperial system in order to make sure that their fundamental economic structures

52:14.080 --> 52:21.280
wouldn't change. They also wanted to weaken Germany as much as possible so that Germany

52:21.280 --> 52:29.440
couldn't rise again. What this leads to is a peace treaty that maintains some of the fundamental

52:29.440 --> 52:37.840
conflicts of the imperial system and bankrupts Germany, starves Germany, and feeds this politics

52:37.840 --> 52:44.960
of resentment that make it impossible for Germany to participate in a European order.

52:45.760 --> 52:52.960
So, people like historian Neil Ferguson, for example, make the case that if Britain stayed

52:52.960 --> 52:58.720
out of World War I, we would have avoided this whole mess, and we would potentially even avoid

52:58.720 --> 53:05.840
World War II. There's kind of counterfactual history. Do you think it's possible to make

53:05.840 --> 53:11.680
the case for that? That there was a moment, especially in that case, staying out of the

53:12.240 --> 53:18.160
war for Britain, that the escalation to a global war could have been avoided and one that ultimately

53:18.160 --> 53:25.360
ends in a deep global resentment. So, where Germany is resentful, not just of France or particular

53:25.360 --> 53:31.520
nations, but is resentful of the entire, I don't know how you define it, the West or something like

53:31.520 --> 53:41.840
this, the entire global world? I wish it were that easy. I think

53:44.480 --> 53:52.560
it's useful to think in counterfactuals, what if, and if you believe, as historians do,

53:52.560 --> 53:58.080
in causation, then if that one thing causes another, then you also have to believe in

53:58.080 --> 54:03.760
counterfactuals, that if something hadn't happened, then maybe that would have worked

54:03.760 --> 54:13.440
differently. But I think all the things that led to World War I are multi-causal and nuanced,

54:13.440 --> 54:18.560
and this is what historians do. We make things more complicated. And so, there was no one thing

54:18.560 --> 54:28.480
that could have turned the tide of history. Oh, if only Hitler had gotten into art school,

54:28.480 --> 54:34.960
or if only Fidel Castro had gotten into the major leagues. Those are interesting thought

54:34.960 --> 54:39.040
experiments, but few events in history, I think, are that contingent.

54:39.040 --> 54:46.400
Well, Hitler is an example of somebody who's a charismatic leader that seems to have a really

54:48.560 --> 54:56.880
disproportionate amount of influence on the tide of history. So, if you look at Stalin,

54:56.880 --> 55:01.440
you could imagine that many other people could have stepped into that role.

55:02.880 --> 55:09.760
And the same goes for many of the other presidents, or even Mao. It seems that there's

55:09.760 --> 55:16.480
a singular nature to Hitler, that you could play the counterfactual, that if there was no Hitler,

55:16.480 --> 55:23.840
you may have not had World War II. He, better than many leaders in history, was able to channel the

55:23.840 --> 55:31.120
resentment of the populace into a very aggressive expansion of the military and, I would say,

55:31.680 --> 55:38.800
skillful deceit of the entire world in terms of his plans, and was able to effectively start the

55:38.960 --> 55:46.880
war. So, is it possible that, I mean, could Hitler have been stopped? Could we have avoided

55:47.600 --> 55:52.880
if he just got into art school? Or, again, do you feel like there's a

55:52.880 --> 55:57.280
current of events that was unstoppable? I mean, part of what you're talking about is

55:58.240 --> 56:04.400
Hitler the individual as a sort of charismatic leader who's able to mobilize the nation,

56:05.040 --> 56:12.560
and part of it is Hitlerism, his own sort of individual ability to, for example, play off

56:12.560 --> 56:18.720
his subordinates against one another to set up a system of that nature that, in some ways,

56:18.720 --> 56:25.120
escalates violence, including the violence that leads to the Holocaust. And some of it is also

56:25.120 --> 56:33.600
Hitlerism as a leader cult, and we see this in many other sort of things where a political movement

56:33.600 --> 56:41.360
surrounds one particular individual who may or may not be replaceable. So, yes, the World War II

56:41.360 --> 56:48.320
we got would have been completely different if a different sort of faction had risen to power in

56:48.320 --> 56:57.520
Germany, but depression era Europe was so unstable and democracies collapsed throughout Western

56:57.520 --> 57:03.440
Europe over the course of the 1930s, whether they had charismatic totalitarian leaders or

57:03.440 --> 57:10.560
not. Have you actually read one book I just recently finished? I'd love to get your opinion

57:11.360 --> 57:16.640
from a historian perspective. There's a book called Blitzed Drugs in the Third Reich by Norman

57:16.640 --> 57:26.480
Ohler. It makes a case that drugs played a very large, meth essentially, played a very large

57:26.480 --> 57:34.560
role in World War II. There's a lot of criticism of this book saying that it's kind of to what

57:34.560 --> 57:39.840
you're saying. It takes this one little variable and makes it like this explains everything.

57:40.400 --> 57:46.160
So everything about Hitler, everything about the blitzkrieg, everything about the military,

57:46.160 --> 57:50.400
the way, the strategy, the decisions could be explained through drugs,

57:50.400 --> 57:55.760
or at least implies that kind of thing. And the interesting thing about this book,

57:55.760 --> 58:00.880
because Hitler and Nazi Germany is one of the most sort of written about periods of human history.

58:01.520 --> 58:08.640
And this was not drugs were almost entirely not written about in this context. So here come along

58:08.640 --> 58:14.640
this semi historian, because I don't think he's even a historian. He's a lot of his work is fiction.

58:15.680 --> 58:20.560
Hopefully, I'm saying that correctly. So he tells a really, that's one of the criticisms,

58:20.560 --> 58:24.880
he tells a very compelling story that drugs were at the center of

58:26.800 --> 58:33.920
this period and also of the man of Hitler. What are your sort of feelings and thoughts about

58:35.520 --> 58:39.520
if you've gotten a chance to read this book, but I'm sure there's books like it,

58:39.520 --> 58:42.640
that tell an interesting perspective, singular perspective on a war.

58:43.680 --> 58:48.960
Yeah, I mean, I have read it. And I also had this sort of eye opening experience that a lot of

58:49.840 --> 58:58.400
historians did. And they're like, why didn't we think about that? And I think whether the author

58:58.400 --> 59:03.600
Oller is sort of not a trained academic historian, but the joy of history is like, you don't have to

59:03.600 --> 59:11.520
be one to write good history. And I don't think anyone sort of criticizes him for that. I like

59:12.720 --> 59:17.520
the book as a window into the Third Reich. Of course, drugs don't explain all of it,

59:18.080 --> 59:27.040
but it helps us see the people who supported Hitler, the ways in which

59:29.040 --> 59:35.120
it was that mind altering and performance altering drugs were used to kind of keep soldiers on the

59:35.120 --> 59:43.600
battlefield, the ways in which. I think that we don't fully understand the extent to which

59:43.600 --> 59:52.560
the Third Reich is held together with duct tape from a pretty early phase by like 1940 or 41 even.

59:53.280 --> 59:59.600
It's all smoke and mirrors. And I think that wartime propaganda, both Germans trying to say,

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.160
we're winning everything and America trying to mobilize and the other allies to mobilize against

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.320
Germany, described a more formidable enemy than it really was by 1941 and 42.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:18.000
Yeah. I mean, I could see both cases. One is that duct tape doesn't make the man,

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:25.360
but also as an engineer, I'm a huge fan of duct tape because it does seem to solve a lot of problems.

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:34.320
And I do worry that this perspective that the book presents about drugs is somehow to the mind

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:41.440
really compelling because it's almost like the mind or at least my mind searches for an answer.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:46.160
How could this have happened? And it's nice to have a clean explanation.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:49.600
And drugs is one popular one. When people talk about steroids and sports,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.320
the moment you introduce the topic of steroids, somehow the mind wants to explain all success

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.960
in the context was because this person was on steroids, Lance Armstrong.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.120
Well, it's like it's a very sticky idea. Certain ideas, certain explanations are very sticky.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:13.760
And I think that's really dangerous because then you lose the full context. And also in the case

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:21.360
of drugs, it removes the responsibility from the person, both for the military genius and the evil.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.760
And I think it's a very dangerous thing to do because something about the mind,

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.320
maybe it's just mine, it's sticky to this. Well, drugs explain it. If the drugs didn't happen,

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:39.600
then it would be very different. It worries me how compelling it is of an explanation.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.160
That's why it's maybe better to think of it as a window into the Third Reich than an explanation

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:51.760
of it. But it's also a nice exploration of Hitler the Man. For some reason, discussing his habits,

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:59.440
especially later in the war, his practices with drugs gives you a window into the person. It

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:07.440
reminds you that this is a human being, like a human being that gets emotional in the morning,

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:15.520
gets thoughtful in the morning, hopeful, sad, depressed, angry, like a story of emotions of

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:22.640
the human being. Somehow we construct, which is a pretty dangerous thing to do, we'll construct an

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.680
evil monster out of Hitler when in reality he's a human being like all of us. I think the lesson

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:33.280
there is the soldier incident lesson, which is all of us to some degree are capable of evil.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:41.840
Or maybe if you want to make it less powerful a statement, many of our leaders are capable of evil,

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:50.000
that this Hitler is not truly singular in history. That, yeah, when the resentment of the populace

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.480
matches the right charismatic leader, it's easy to make the kind of, not easy, but it's possible

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.040
to frequently make the kind of initiation of military conflict that happened in World War

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:13.760
II. By the way, because you said not a trained historian, one of the most compelling and,

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.400
I don't know, entertaining and fascinating exploration of World War I comes from Dan

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:25.440
Carlin. I don't know if you've gotten a chance to listen to his sort of podcast form telling of the

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:31.360
blueprint for Armageddon, which is the telling of World War I. What do you think about Dan Carlin,

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.840
you yourself as a historian who has studied, who has written about World War I, do you enjoy

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:45.360
that kind of telling of history? Absolutely. And I think, again, you don't need a PhD in history to

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.240
be a historian. Does every historian agree with that? He gets quite a bit of criticism from

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:57.600
historians. We like to argue with each other and nitpick with each other, but the one thing I have

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:06.880
no patience for is when we pull rank on each other. I think we depend on, if you're a historian in a

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.640
university with degrees and research materials, you depend on the work of people in some local

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:19.600
community like recording oral history, saving documents. And history is a social science,

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:26.880
but it's also a storytelling art. History books are the ones you find on the shelves in bookstores

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:34.080
that people read for fun. And you can appreciate both the knowledge production as well as the

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:40.400
storytelling. And when you get a good oral storyteller like Dan Carlin, there's a reason

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.680
that thousands and hundreds of thousands of people tune in. Yeah, but he definitely suffers

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:51.120
from anxiety about getting things correct and it's very difficult. Well, our first job is to

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:58.080
get the facts correct and then to tell the story off of those. But the facts are so fuzzy. So

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:06.560
I mean, you have probably my favorite telling of World War II is William Shire's Rise and

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:15.200
Fall of the Third Reich, or at least not telling of Nazi Germany. And that goes to primary sources

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:23.920
a lot, which is like, I suppose that's the honest way to do it, but it's tough. It's really tough

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:30.640
to write that way, to really go to primary sources always. And I think that one of the things that

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:37.760
Dan tries to do, which is also really tough to do, perhaps easier in oral history, is

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.000
try to make you feel what it was like to be there,

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.880
which I think he does by trying to tell the story of like individual soldiers.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:57.040
Do you find that telling like individual citizens? Do you find that kind of telling of history

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:07.040
compelling? Yeah, I mean, I think we need historical imagination. And I think historical

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:14.320
imagination teaches something very valuable, which is humility, to realize that there are

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.080
other people who've lived on this planet and they organized their lives differently. And

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:28.240
you know, they made it through just fine too. And you know, I think that that kind of

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.520
meeting other people from the past can be actually a very useful skill for meeting

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:42.720
people unlike you in the present. Unlike you, but also like you. I think both are humbling.

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:49.520
One, realizing that they live in a different space and time. But two, realizing that if you were

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.960
placed in that space and time, you might have done all the same things, whether it's the brave,

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:03.760
good thing or the evil thing. Yeah, absolutely. And you get also a sense of possibility. You know,

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:08.480
there's this famous line, right? That, you know, those who do not learn history are condemned to

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.400
repeat it. But I think the other half is true as well, which is those who do not learn history

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.560
don't get the chance to repeat it, right? You know, that we're not the first people on this

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.400
planet to face any certain kinds of problems. You know, other people have lived through worlds

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.760
like this one before. It's like when you fall in love as a teenager for the first time and then

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:36.960
there's a breakup. You think it's the greatest tragedy that has ever happened in the world.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:44.720
You're the first person, even though like Romeo and Juliet and so on had this issue. You're the

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:51.280
first person that truly feels the catastrophic heartbreak of that experience. It's good to be

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:57.520
reminded that no, the human condition is what it is. We have lived through it at the individual

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:04.480
and the societal scale. Let me ask you about nationalism, which I think is at the core of

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:12.880
I want you poster. Is nationalism destructive or empowering to a nation? And we can use different

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:19.360
words like patriotism, which is in many ways synonymous to nationalism. But in recent history,

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:26.960
perhaps because of the Nazis has slowly parted ways that somehow nationalism is when patriotism

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.800
gone bad or something like this. Yeah, they're different, right? Patriotism,

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:40.720
you know, patriotism is in some ways best thought of as an emotion, right? And a feeling of love of

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:48.960
country, right? You know, literally. And in some ways that's a necessary condition to participate

01:08:48.960 --> 01:09:00.000
in nationalism. You know, whether to me, I think nationalism is crucial in a world organized around

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.480
nation states. And you have to sort of believe that you are engaged in a common project

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:11.360
together, right? And so, you know, in the contemporary United States, you know,

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.040
in some ways that that question is actually on the table in ways that it hasn't been in the past.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.160
But you have to believe that you're engaged in a common project, that you have something in common

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:29.440
with the person with whom you share this nation and that you would sacrifice for them, whether

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:36.000
it's by paying taxes for them or, you know, or going to war to defend them. That's a vision of,

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.560
you know, what we might call civic nationalism. That's the good version.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:47.920
The question is whether you can have that without having exclusionary nationalism,

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.680
you know, hating the other, right? Fearing the other, saying, yeah, you're part of this nation

01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:01.040
against all others. And I think there's a long tradition in America of a very inclusive

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:10.320
nationalism that is open, inclusive, welcoming, and, you know, new people to this shared project.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.840
That's something to be defended. Exclusionary nationalisms based on, you know,

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.880
ethnic hatreds and others that we see throughout the world, those are things to be afraid of.

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:30.080
But there is a kind of narrative in the United States that a nationalism that includes the big

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.880
umbrella of democratic nations, nations that strive for freedom and everybody else is against

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.280
freedom and against human nature. And it just so happens that it's a half and half split

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:50.000
across the world. So that's imperialism. That feels like it beats the drum of war.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.400
Yeah. And I mean, I don't want to paint too rosy a picture and certainly, you know, the United States

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.680
as a nation has often found it easier to define ourselves against something

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:11.680
than to clarify exactly what we're for. Yeah. Yeah. The cold war, China today.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.360
That's not only the United States, I suppose that's human nature.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.400
We need a competitor. It's almost like maybe the success of human civilization requires

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:31.920
figuring out how to construct competitors that don't result in global war.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:40.800
Yes, or figuring out how to turn enemies into rivals and competitors. There's a real difference.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.400
You know, you compete with competitors. You fight with enemies.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.560
Yeah. With competitors as a respect, maybe even a love underlying the competition.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.360
What lessons? What are the biggest lessons you take away from World War I?

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.360
Maybe we talked about several, but you know, you look back at the 20th century, what

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:15.600
as a historian, what do you learn about human nature, about human civilization, about history

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:19.920
from looking at this war? I think the

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:32.640
lesson I would want everyone to take from the story of the First World War is that

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:41.280
human life is not cheap. That all of the warring powers thought that just by throwing

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.640
more men and more material at the front, they would solve their political problems with military

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:56.560
force. And at the end of the day, in 1918, one side did win that, but it didn't actually solve

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:05.280
any of those political problems. And in the end, the regular people paid the price with their lives.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:12.720
They did. And people who had been told that their lives were cheap remembered that.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.080
And it sort of reshapes mass politics for the rest of the 20th century, both in Europe and

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:27.040
around the world. Yeah, the cost of the death of a single soldier is not just,

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:34.960
or a single civilian is not just the cost of that single life. It's the resentment that the anger,

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:40.880
the hate that reverberates throughout. One of the things I saw in Ukraine is the birth of,

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.320
at scale, of generational hate, not towards administrations or leaders, but towards entire

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:57.440
peoples. Overnight, that hate is created, and it takes perhaps decades for that hate to dissipate.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:05.120
It takes decades, and it takes collective effort to build institutions that divert that hate

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:13.840
into other places. One of the biggest things I thought was not part of the calculus

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:23.840
in when the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq is the creation of hate. When you drop a bomb,

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:33.840
even if it hits military targets, even if it kills soldiers, which in that case it didn't,

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:47.040
there's a very large amount of civilians. How many minutes, hours, months, and years of hate

01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:52.960
do you create with a single bomb you drop? And I calculate that. Literally, in the Pentagon,

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.960
have a chart. How many people will hate us? How many people does it take? Do some science here.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:03.120
How many people does it take? When you have a million people that hate you,

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:12.720
how many of them will become terrorists? How many of them will do something to the nation you love

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:17.120
and care about, which is the United States, will do something that will be very costly?

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.760
I feel like there was not a plot in a chart. It was more about short-term effects.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:31.360
Yes. Again, it's the idea of using a military force to solve political problems. I think there's a

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:36.800
squandering of goodwill that people have around the world towards the United States. That's a

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:45.200
respect for its economy, for its consumer products, and so forth. I think that's been lost a lot of

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:51.200
that. Do you think leaders can stop war? I have perhaps a romantic notion, perhaps because I do

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.080
these podcasts in person and so on, that leaders that get in a room together and can talk,

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.640
they can stop war. I mean, that's the power of a leader, especially one in an authoritarian regime

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:14.960
that they can, through camaraderie, alleviate some of the emotions associated with the ego.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.320
Yes. Leaders can stop war if they get into the room

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:29.520
when they understand from the masses in their countries that war is something that they want

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.400
stopped. The people ultimately have a really big say.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:41.440
They do. It was mass movements by people in the United States for the nuclear freeze,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.960
in Russia pushing for openness that brought, for example, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev to

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:58.560
Reykjavik to debate and eventually put caps on nuclear weapons. Those two people made choices

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:05.440
in the room that made that possible, but they were both being pushed and knew they were being

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:12.640
pushed by their people. Boy, that's a tough one. It puts a lot of responsibility on the German

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:21.600
people, for example. In both wars, we fans of history tend to conceive of history as a meeting

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.640
of leaders. We think of Chamberlain, we think of Churchill and the importance of them in the

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:31.520
Second World War. We think about Hitler and Stalin and think that if certain conversations

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:37.120
happened, the war could have been avoided. You tell the story of how many times Hitler

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:44.080
and Nazi Germany's military might was not sufficient. They could have been easily stopped.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.480
The pacifists, the people who believed Hitler or foolish enough to believe Hitler

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.640
didn't act properly. If the leaders just woke up to that idea.

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:04.320
Yeah. In fact, Churchill is a kind of representation of that, but in your conception

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:08.000
here, it's possible that Churchill was also a representation of the British people,

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:17.200
even though seemingly unpopular. That force gave birth to somebody like Churchill,

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.680
who said, we'll never surrender, right? She'll fight in the beaches.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:30.880
And I think World War II Britain is a good example of that. It is clearly a dynamic leader

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:39.600
who has his pulse on what the people want and demand and are willing to do. It's a dynamic art

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.000
of leading that and shaping those wants at the same time as knowing that you're bound by them.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:54.000
Well, then if we conceive a history in this way, let me ask you about our presidents. You are

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.040
taking on the impossibly difficult task of teaching a course in a couple of years here,

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:04.880
or in one year called the History of American Presidential Elections.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.480
So if the people are in part responsible for leaders,

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:17.600
how can we explain what is going on in America that we have the leaders that we do today?

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:27.520
So if we think about the elections of the past several cycles, I guess let me ask,

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.120
are we a divided nation? Are we more of a divided nation than we were in the past?

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:36.400
What do you understand about the American citizen at the beginning of this century

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:44.400
from the leaders we have elected? Yes, obviously, we are a divided country

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:58.960
in our rhetoric, in our day-to-day politics, but we are nowhere near as divided as we have been

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:04.720
in other periods in our history, right? The most obvious, of course, being in the American Civil

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:13.040
War 150 years ago. And the distinction is not just that we haven't come to blows,

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:23.680
but that we are fundamentally one society, one economy, and deeply integrated as a nation,

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:33.200
both domestically and on the world stage in ways that look nothing like the United States in 1861.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.520
You know, will political rhetoric continue to be extreme? Of course,

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.400
but we're not as divided as people think we are.

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:55.360
Well, then if you actually look throughout human history, does it always get so outside of the

01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:02.160
people, do the elections get as contentious as they've recently been? So there's a kind

01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:08.000
of perception has been very close, and there's a lot of accusations, a lot of tensions. It's

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.120
very heated. It's almost fueling the machine of division. Has that often been the case?

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.640
It has. It has and it hasn't. I mean, I do think right now is different. And there it's worth

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:27.120
distinguishing, are there deep social or economic divisions, which I don't actually think that there

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:32.800
are versus partisanship in particular, sort of the rivalry between the two parties.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.800
And it's very clear that we are in an era of what political scientists call hyperpartisanship,

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:47.440
and that the two parties have taken fundamentally different positions and moved further apart from

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:56.480
one another. And that is what I think people talk about when they say our country is divided. So

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:02.640
the country may not be divided even if our politics are highly partisan. That is a divergence

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:08.880
from other time periods in our history. So I wonder if this kind of political partisanship

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:18.960
is actually an illusion of division. I sometimes feel like we mostly all agree

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:28.000
on some basic fundamentals. And the things that people allegedly disagree on are really blown out

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.440
of proportion. And there's like a media machine and the politicians really want you to pick a

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:40.000
blue side and the red side. And because of that, somehow, I mean, families break up over Thanksgiving

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:45.200
dinner about who they voted for. There's a really strong pressure to be the red or blue.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:52.320
And I wonder if that's a feature or a bug, whether this is just part of the mechanism

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.360
of democracy that we want to, even if there's not a real thing to be divided over, we need to

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:05.200
construct it such that you can always have attention of ideas in order to make progress,

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.560
to figure out how to progress as a nation. I think we're figuring that out in real time,

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:18.720
on the one hand, it's easy to say that it's a feature of a political system that has two

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:26.320
parties. And the United States is in some ways unique in not being a parliamentary democracy.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.560
And so in some ways, you would think that would be the feature that is causing

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:38.960
partisanship and to reach these heights. That said, we can even see in parliamentary systems

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:47.200
all around the world that the same kinds of rhetorics of irreconcilable division,

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:54.800
a kind of politics of emotion are proliferating around the world. Some of that, as you say,

01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:03.360
I think is not as real as it appears on television, on social media, and other formats.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:09.680
So I don't know that other countries that are experiencing political conflict,

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.840
I'm not sure that they're deeply divided either.

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:22.720
So I've had the fortune of being intellectually active through the George Bush versus Al Gore

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:29.920
election, then the Obama and just every election since. And it seems like a large

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:34.800
percentage of those elections, there's been a claim that the elections were rigged,

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:42.880
that there is some conspiracy, corruption, malevolence on the other side.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:50.800
I distinctly remember when Donald Trump won in 2016, a lot of people I know said that election

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:58.720
was rigged. And there's different explanations, including Russian influence. And then in 2020,

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:04.960
I was just running in Austin, along the river. And somebody said like, oh, huge fan

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.160
of the podcast. And they said like, what do you think of this is just not right? What's happening

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:18.160
in this country? That the 2020 election was obviously rigged from their perspective in

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:27.040
electing Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. Do you think there's a case to be made for and against

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:32.880
each claim in the full context of history of our elections being rigged?

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:43.280
I think the American election system is fundamentally sound and reliable.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:55.600
And I think that the evidence is clear for that regardless of which election you're looking at,

01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:01.600
in some ways, whether you look at a presidential election or even a local county election for

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:11.520
dogcatcher or something, that the amount of time and resources and precision that go into

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:21.440
voter registration, vote counting, certification processes are crucial to democratic institutions.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:29.920
I think when someone says rigged, regardless of which side of the political spectrum they're

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:39.920
coming from, they're looking for an answer. They're looking for that one answer for what

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:49.200
is in fact a complex system. So on the left, when they say rigged, they may be pointing to a wide

01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:58.960
range of ways in which they think that the system is tilted through gerrymandering,

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:07.120
misrepresentation through the electoral college. On the right, when people say rigged, they may

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:17.760
be concerned about voter security, about ways in which the mainstream media may control

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:29.360
messages and in which in both cases, the feeling is it's articulated as my vote didn't get counted

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:42.000
right. But the deeper concern is my vote doesn't count. My voice isn't being heard. So no, I don't

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.360
think the elections are rigged. So let me sort of push back. There's a comfort to the story that

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:54.960
they're not rigged. And a lot of us like to live in comfort. So people who articulate conspiracy

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.720
theories say, sure, it's nice to be comfortable, but here's the reality. And the thing they

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.640
articulate is there's incentives in close elections, which we seem to have nonstop close elections.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:13.440
There's so many financial interests. There's so many powerful people. Surely you can construct

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.920
not just with the media and all the ways you describe both on the left and the right,

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:24.880
the elections could be rigged, but literally actually in a fully illegal way,

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:31.840
manipulate the results of votes. Surely there's incentive to do that.

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:39.760
And I don't think that's a totally ridiculous argument because it's like, all right, well,

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:48.800
I mean, it actually lands to the question, which is a hard question for me to ask as ultimately

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:55.840
as an optimist of how many malevolent people out there and how many malevolent people are required

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:03.360
to rig an election. So how many, what is the phase transition for a system to become from like

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:12.400
a corruption light to high level of corruption such that you could do things like rig elections,

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:19.360
which is what happens quite a lot in many nations in the world even today.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.560
So yes, there is interference in elections and there has been in American history,

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.440
and we can go all the way back into the 18th century. You don't have to go back to Texas in

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:39.360
the 1960s at an LBJ to find examples of direct interference in the outcome of elections. And

01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:48.560
there are incentives to do that. Those incentives will only feel more existential as hyperpartisanship

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:56.240
makes people think that the outcome of the elections are a matter of black and white

01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:06.240
or life and death. And you will see people sort of organizing sort of every way they can

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:14.160
to shape elections. We saw this in the 1850s when settlers, pro and anti-slavery flooded into Kansas

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:21.360
to try to sort of determine the outcome of an election. We see this in the reconstruction

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:28.240
period when the Ku Klux Klan shows up to block the doors for black voters in the South.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:39.680
This history is not new, it's there. I think the reason why I think that the system is sound

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:46.160
or the reason when I say I believe that the election system is fundamentally sound,

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:53.840
it's not, I'm not trying to be reassuring or encourage complacency, right? I'm saying like,

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:57.760
you know, this is something that we need to do and to work on.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:05.760
So the current electoral mechanisms are sufficiently robust. Even if there is corruption,

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.640
even if there is rigging, they're robust, like the force that corrects itself, self-corrects

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:16.400
and ensures that nobody gets out of line is much stronger than the other incentives,

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:22.480
which are like the corrupting incentives. That's the thing I talked about corrupt, you know,

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.400
visiting Ukraine talking about corruption, where a lot of people talk about

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:35.280
corruption as being a symptom, not if the system allows, creates the incentives for there to be

01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:40.400
corruption, humans will always go for corruption. That's just, you have to assume that the power of

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.760
the United States is that it constructs systems that prevent you from being corrupt at scale. At

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:50.000
least, I mean, it depends what you believe, but most of us, if you believe in this country, you

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:58.640
have to, you believe in the, in the self-correcting mechanisms of corruption that even if that desire

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:05.600
is in the human heart, the system resisted, prevents it. That's, that's your, that's your current

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:15.040
belief. Yes, as of today. But I do, you know, I do think that those, you know, that that will require

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:22.640
oversight by institutions, ideally ones that are insulated as much as possible from partisan

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:29.200
politics, which is very difficult right now. And it will require that the demands of the American

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:36.240
people, that they, you know, that they want these elections to be, to be fair and secure. And that

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:42.480
means, you know, that means being willing to lose them, you know, regardless of which, which party

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:47.360
you're, you're in favor of. So what do you think about the power of the media to create partisanship?

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:53.360
I'm really worried that there's a huge incentive, speaking of incentives, to divide the country.

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.960
The media and the politicians, I'm not sure where it originates, but it feels like it's

01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:05.040
the media. Maybe it's a very cynical perspective on journalism, but it seems like if we're angry

01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:10.720
and divided as evenly as possible, you're going to maximize the number of clicks. So it's almost

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:17.920
like the media wants to elect people that are going to be the most divisive maximizing. And

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:27.520
the worry I have is they are not beyond either feeding or if you want to be very cynical,

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.920
manufacturing narratives that lead that division, like the narrative of an election being rigged.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.480
Because if you convinced half the populace that the election was completely rigged,

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:47.040
that's a really good way to get a lot of clicks. And like the very cynical view is I don't know

01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:57.440
if the media machine will stop the destruction of our democracy in service of getting more clicks.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:04.640
It may destroy our entire democracy just to get more clicks, just because the fire, as the thing

01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:13.040
burns down, will get clicks. Am I putting too much blame on the media here? The machine of it.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:18.800
You're diagnosing the incentive structure. You're depicting that with 100% accuracy.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:26.880
100% accuracy. But I think history teaches that you might be giving the media too much

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:35.760
causal power, that the American people are smarter than the media that they consume.

01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:45.040
And even today, we know that. Even people who consume just Fox or just MSNBC

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:52.960
know what they're consuming, right? And so I don't think that media will be the solution.

01:34:54.400 --> 01:35:00.240
And I certainly don't think that returning to a media structure of the mid-20th century

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:07.200
with three news channels that all tell us one story, that's no golden age that we're trying

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:14.080
to get back to, for sure. Well, there is a novel thing in human history, which is Twitter,

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:20.800
which is Twitter and social media, and so on. So we're trying to find our footing as a nation

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:30.000
to figure out how to think about politics, how to maintain our basic freedoms, our sense of

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.880
democracy, of our interaction with government, and so on, on this new medium of social media.

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.120
Do you think Twitter, how do you think Twitter changed things? Do you think Twitter is good

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:50.880
for democracy? Do you think it has changed what it means to be an American citizen?

01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:55.920
Or is it just the same old media mechanism?

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:02.560
It has not changed what it means to be an American citizen. It may have changed the

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:12.080
day-to-day sound of being and the experience of it. It got noisier, it got louder,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:22.560
and it got more decentered. I think Twitter, it's paradoxical. On the one hand, it is a

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:29.520
fundamentally democratic platform, right? And in some ways, it democratizes institutions

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:36.880
that had gatekeepers and authority figures for a very long time. But on the other hand,

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.080
it's not a democratic institution at all. It's a for-profit corporation,

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:49.760
and it operates under those principles. And so that said, it's an institution of American

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:58.720
and global life that the people of the United States have the authority to regulate or reshape

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.360
as they see fit, both that and other major media players.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:08.160
So one of the most dramatic decisions that illustrate both sides of what you're saying

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:13.920
is when Twitter decided to ban, I think permanently, the President of the United States,

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:21.440
Donald Trump, off of Twitter. Can you make the case that that was a good idea and make the case

01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:24.800
that that was a bad idea? Can you see both perspectives on this?

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:34.640
Yes. The simple fact of the matter is Twitter is a platform. It has rules of service. Twitter

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.480
concluded that President Trump had violated the terms of service and blocked them, right? And if

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:52.160
you have rules, you have to enforce them. Did it have consequences? It had direct and predictable

01:37:52.160 --> 01:38:04.640
consequences of creating a sense among millions of Americans that Twitter had taken a side in

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:12.320
politics or confirming their belief that it had done so. Will it have unintended consequences?

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.080
This is where the historian can come in and say, yes, there's always unintended consequences.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:25.680
And we don't know what it would mean for political figures to be excluded from

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:37.120
various media platforms under these notions that they had violated terms of service, etc. So

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:44.480
I guess we'll see. Well, to me, I'm generally against censorship,

01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:53.760
but to take Twitter's perspective, it's unclear to me in terms of unintended consequences whether

01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:02.160
censoring a human being from being part of your platform is going to decrease or increase the

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:09.200
amount of hate in the world. So it is a strong case to be made that banning somebody like

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:16.880
Donald Trump increases the amount of resentment among people and a very large number of people

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:22.480
that support him or even love him or even see him as a great president, one of the greatest

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:28.800
this country has had. And so if you completely suppress his voice, you're going to intensify the

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:35.840
support that he has from just the regular support for another human being who ran for president

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:43.920
to somebody that becomes an almost heroic figure for that set of people. Now, the flip side is

01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:52.480
removing a person from a platform like Donald Trump might lessen the megaphone of that particular

01:39:52.480 --> 01:40:01.440
person, might actually level the democratic notion that everybody has a voice. So basically,

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:09.120
removing the loud extremes is helpful for giving the center, the calm, the thoughtful

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:15.280
voices more power. And so in that sense, that teaches a lesson that don't be crazy in any

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:25.440
one direction. Don't go full, don't go Lenin, don't go Hitler. You have to stay in the middle.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:29.040
There's divisions in the middle, there's discussions in the middle, but stay in the middle.

01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:38.240
That's sort of the steel man, the case for censoring. But boy, is censorship a slippery

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:46.160
slope. And also, boys, Twitter becoming a thing that's more than just a company. It seems like

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:55.040
it's a medium of communication that we use for information, for knowledge, for wisdom even.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.640
During the period of COVID, we used it to gain an understanding of what the hell is going on.

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:07.360
What should we do? What's the state of the art science? Science fundamentally transformed during

01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.080
the time of COVID because you have no time for the full review cycle that science usually goes

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:18.800
through. And some of the best sources of information for me, from the conspiracy theory to the best

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:25.360
doctors was Twitter. The data, the stats, all that kind of stuff. And that feels like more than a

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:31.360
company. And then Twitter and YouTube and different places took a really strong stance on COVID,

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.680
which is the lazy stance in my opinion, which is we're going to listen to whatever

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:44.800
CDC or the institutions have said. But the reality is you're an institution of your own now.

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:54.480
You're kind of the press. It's a really difficult position. It's a really, really

01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.320
difficult position to take. But I wish they have stepped up and take on the full responsibility

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:03.200
and the pain of fighting for the freedom of speech.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:15.440
AC Yes, they need to do that. But I'm struck by some of the things that you said, ways in which

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:24.400
Twitter has the power to shape the conversation. And I don't think in a democratic society,

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:32.480
the democratic polities should cede that power to for-profit companies.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.640
LW Do you agree that it's possible that Twitter has that power currently? Do you sense that it

01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.600
has the power? Because my sense is Twitter has the power to start wars, like tweets have the

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:51.760
power to start wars, to change the direction of elections. AC Maybe in the sense in the ways in

01:42:51.760 --> 01:43:02.240
which a wave has the power to wash away sand. It's still the medium. It's not in itself an

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:07.840
actor. It's how actors use the platform, which requires us to scrutinize the structure of the

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.320
platform and access to it. LW Unfortunately, it's not maybe similar to the wave. It's not just a

01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:22.480
medium. It's a medium plus. It's a medium that enables virality, that benefits from virality

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:33.760
of engagement. And that means singular voices can have a disproportionate impact. Not even voices,

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:39.520
singular ideas, dramatic ideas can have a disproportionate impact. And so that actually

01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.360
threatens, it's almost like, I don't know what the equivalent is in nature, but it's a wave that

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:54.400
can grow exponentially because of the initial intensity of the wave. I don't know how to

01:43:54.400 --> 01:44:01.920
describe this as a dynamical system, but it feels like there is a responsibility there not to

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.440
accelerate voices just because they get a lot of engagement. You have to have a proportional

01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:14.800
representation of that voice. But you're saying that a strong democracy should be robust to that.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:21.120
LW A strong democracy can and should and will be. I think the other thing a historian will

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:30.640
tell you about Twitter is that this too shall pass. But I do think the structures of the platform,

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:40.640
of the algorithm, of this and other major players are eligible for scrutiny by democratic institutions.

01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.600
So in preparing to teach the course, the history of American presidential elections leading up to

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:54.400
the 2024 elections. So one of the lessons of history is this too shall pass. So don't make

01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:59.680
everything about, this is going to either save or destroy our nation. That seems to be like the

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:07.360
message of every single election as I'm doing Trump hands. Do you think Donald Trump, what do

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:13.760
you think about the 2024 election? Do you think Donald Trump runs? Do you think the tension

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:23.680
will grow? Or was that a singular moment? Do you think you'll be like AOC versus Trump or

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:29.120
whatever the most drama maximizing thing? Or will things stabilize?

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.360
I think historians don't like to predict the future, but I can predict this one,

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:42.160
that it will not be a calm and stabilized election. I think as of the time that we're

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:48.960
talking in 2022, there are too many open questions, particularly about whether Joe Biden will run for

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:58.640
reelection. He says he will, but the jury I think is out on that. I can't predict whether

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:09.840
Donald Trump will run for election or not. I think we do know that President Trump doesn't like to

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:18.000
start things he can't win. And if the polling data suggests that he's not a credible candidate,

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:27.280
he might be reluctant to enter the race and might find more appealing the sideline kingmaker role

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:34.160
that he's been crafting since he left the White House. I think there are plenty of people who are

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:43.120
dreaming that there's some sort of centrist candidate, whether it's a conservative Democrat

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:50.800
or a liberal Republican who will save us from all of this, either within the party or in a third

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:54.880
party run. I don't think that's likely. Why aren't we getting them? Why don't you think

01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.280
it's likely? What's the explanation? There seems to be a general hunger for a person like this.

01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:06.640
You would, but the system sorts it out. The primary systems and the party candidate selection

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:13.520
systems will favor more partisan views, right? More conservative Republicans, more liberal

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:20.720
Democrats as the kind of center candidates. It seems like the system prefers mediocre

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:30.080
executive, mediocre leaders, mediocre partisan leaders. If I take a cynical look, but maybe

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.480
I'm romanticizing the leaders of the past and maybe I'm just remembering the great leaders of

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.320
the past. Yeah, I can assure you there's plenty of mediocre partisans in the 19th century.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:49.760
Okay. And the 20th. Well, let me ask you about platforming. Do you think,

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.160
Donald, it's the Twitter question, but I was torn about whether to talk to Donald Trump on this

01:47:56.160 --> 01:48:08.560
podcast. As a historian, what would you advise? This is a difficult question for historians who

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:18.720
want to make sure that they know what Americans are thinking and talking about for centuries

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:25.760
later. So one of the things that, at least my understanding is that when President Trump was

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:33.280
banned from Twitter, his account was also deleted. And that is one of the most valuable sources that

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:41.280
historians will use to understand the era and parts of it were archived and reconstructed.

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:48.720
But in that sense, I think that that is also a real loss to the historical record. I mean,

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:58.160
I think that your podcast shows you'll talk to anyone. So I'm here, right? So I'm not in

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:04.080
the business of saying, don't talk. That's one of the difficult things when I think about Hitler.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:11.040
I think Hitler, Stalin, I don't know if World War I quite has the same intensity of

01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:19.680
controversial leaders. But one of the sad things from a historian perspective is how few interviews

01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:27.600
Hitler has given or Stalin has given. And that's such a difficult thing because it's obvious that

01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:35.760
talking to Donald Trump, that talking to Xi Jinping, talking to Putin is really valuable from a

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:41.920
historical perspective to understand. But then you think about the momentary impact

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:47.200
of such a conversation and you think, well, depending on how the conversation goes, you could

01:49:47.200 --> 01:50:00.400
steer or feed the flame of war or conflict or abuses of power and things like this.

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.880
And that's, I think, the tension between the journalist and the historian.

01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:12.160
Because when journalists interview dictators, for example, one of the things that strikes me

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:23.520
is they're often very critical of the dictator. They're basically attacking them in front of

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:29.360
their face as opposed to trying to understand. Because what I perceive they're doing is they're

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.240
signaling to the other journalists that they're on the right side of history kind of thing.

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:40.400
But that's not very productive. And it's also why the dictators and leaders often don't do those

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.880
interviews. It's not productive to understanding who the human being is. To understand, you have

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:54.080
to empathize. Because few people, I think, few leaders do something from a place of malevolence.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:59.920
I think they really do think they're doing good. And not even for themselves, not even for selfish

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.280
reasons. I think they're doing great for the, they're doing the right thing for their country

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:09.440
or for whoever the group they're leading. And to understand that, you have to,

01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:17.840
and by the way, a large percent of the country often supports them. I bet if you legitimately

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.120
poll people in North Korea, they will believe that their leader is doing the right thing for

01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:30.320
their country. And so to understand that, you have to empathize. So that's the tension of the

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:35.120
journalist, I think, and the historian, because obviously the historian doesn't care. They really

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:41.840
want to, they care obviously deeply, but they know that history requires deep understanding

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:46.800
of the human being in the full context. Yeah, it's a tough decision to make.

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:53.360
Well, I think it's both for journalists and historians, the challenge is not to be too

01:51:53.360 --> 01:52:02.640
close to your subject and not to be overly influenced and used by them. When you're

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:10.640
talking to a living subject, which historians do too, it's a matter of making sure that you

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:18.560
triangulate their story with the rest of the record. And that may paint a different picture

01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:26.080
of the person and will prevent you as a journalist or a historian from just telling

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:33.840
someone else's story. And historians also have the benefit of going back 30, 40 years and finding

01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:40.240
all the other stories and figuring out, playing two truths and a lie, which parts are

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.960
accurate, which are not. And journalists do that work in a day-to-day basis, but historians,

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.520
we get a little more time to think about what we're doing.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:56.240
Well, I personally also think it's deeply disrespectful to the populace, to people,

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:03.600
to censor and ignore a person that's supported by a very large number of people.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:14.640
Like that you owe, I personally feel like you owe the citizens of this country a deep

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.520
empathy and understanding of the leaders they support, even if you disagree with what they

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:31.840
say. To me, I'm much more worried about the resentment of the censorship. To having a good

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:39.040
conversation with Donald Trump is ultimately valuable because he, I think, especially in this

01:53:39.040 --> 01:53:46.480
case, I agree with you that Donald Trump is not a singular person. He represents a set of feelings

01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.520
that a large number of people have. And whatever those feelings are, you can try to figure out by

01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:58.000
talking to people, but also talking to the man and then seeing the interplay there. What does this

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:05.360
really represent in this period in history, in this slice of the world? Yeah. Ultimately,

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.000
understanding, I think, leads to compassion and love and unity, which is how this whole thing

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:18.720
progresses. The tension between the different sides is useful to have a good conversation,

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:23.200
but ultimately coming up with the right answer and progressing towards that answer is how you

01:54:23.200 --> 01:54:30.240
make progress. Do you think a pure democracy can work? We have this representative democracy

01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:36.400
with these contentious elections and so on. When we start a civilization on Mars,

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.880
which becomes more and more realistic technologically, we can have a more direct

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:47.920
access to be able to vote on issues and vote for ideas. Do you think it can work?

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:58.960
I don't think we have to go to Mars to do it. I think the answer is not to flip a switch and

01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:04.880
turn on something called pure democracy when people are not ready for it, when their

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:13.280
incentive structures are not structured for it. But you can experiment with more democratic forms

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:21.680
of governance one after another, whether it's experimenting with technology to find new ways

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:29.920
of getting greater rates of participation in democracy. I think that we see some experiments

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:37.520
in more complicated systems of voting that, in fact, might actually be more reflective of

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:43.520
people's choices than simply picking one candidate, rank choice voting or runoffs,

01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:50.000
other kinds of things. I think that we can think more creatively about something like

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:58.240
participatory budgeting in which we put all this money into the government and then we should,

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:04.480
as a people, there are more democratic ways of how we spend it. I think the most urgent in some

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.600
level is a more democratic form of foreign policy making. That foreign policy making,

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:17.600
decision making about the military, about foreign policy is in many ways insulated from popular

01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:27.760
participation in modern American history. Technology is not going to solve this. It's

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:34.080
a combination of technology and human creativity, but I think we can start heading that direction.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:37.520
Whether we get there before we get to Mars, I don't know.

01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.920
What interesting lessons and thoughts, if you look at the fundamentals of the history of American

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:53.760
elections, do you hope to reveal when you try to teach the class? How would those fundamentals be

01:56:53.760 --> 01:57:02.720
met by the students that receive that wisdom? What do you think about this dance, especially

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.120
such an interesting idea, and I hope you do go through with this kind of idea,

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:10.800
is look at the history while the next one is happening.

01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:20.880
Yes. I think it's worth remembering that the students who are typical American student who's

01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:29.360
in college right now has lived their entire life after the election of 2000 and Bush v. Gore.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.960
And after 9-11 probably.

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:42.480
And yeah, absolutely. After all of these things. So on the one hand, they take partisanship and

01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:54.720
contentious elections for granted. They don't, I think, share some vision that things used to be

01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:01.360
different. They don't remember a world that had lots of moderate Democrats and liberal Republicans

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:10.080
sort of running around in it. So in some ways, it's a way of looking back into the past to find

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:19.280
other ways of organizing our politics. It's also a way of reassuring students that we have been

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:26.640
through contentious and even sort of violent elections before in our history and that people

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:33.040
have defended the right to vote. People have risked their lives to vote. I think they will

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:43.200
understand that as well. And maybe knowledge of history here can help de-escalate the emotions

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:48.720
you might feel about one candidate or another. And from a place of calmness,

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.520
you can more easily arrive at wisdom.

01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:54.560
That's my hope.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:06.000
Just as a brief aside, you wrote the book Bound by War that describes a century of war in the

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:16.800
Pacific. Looking at this slice of geography and power, most crucially through the partnership

01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:22.800
between the United States and the Philippines, can you tell some aspects of the story that is

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:28.640
often perhaps not considered when you start to look more at the geopolitics of Europe and

01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:37.360
Soviet Union and the United States? How did the war in the Pacific define the 20th century?

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:45.680
Yeah, I came to this book Bound by War from a sense that our stories were too lopsided

01:59:46.720 --> 01:59:50.960
toward Europe, right? That American history, when viewed from the Pacific,

01:59:51.600 --> 01:59:58.640
specifically in the 20th century, helps us understand American power in some new ways.

01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:07.520
Not only American projection of power into Asia, but also the ways in which American power affected

02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:15.600
people in Asia, either in places like the Philippines where the United States had a colony

02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:20.720
for almost 50 years, or Asian Americans, people who had migrated over their descendants in the

02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:27.360
United States. Those linkages between the United States and Asia, particularly the US-Philippine

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:32.000
connection, I think were something that needed to be traced across the 20th century because it's

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:38.640
a new way of seeing American power from a different angle. You see it in that way.

02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:44.800
What are some aspects that define America when you take the perspective of the Pacific?

02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.080
What military conflict and the asymmetry of power there?

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:59.040
Right. I start in 1898 with the US invasion of the Philippines, its conquest and annexation.

02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.520
I think in many ways, this is a defining conflict of the 20th century that's often completely

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:11.280
overlooked. We're described, I think incorrectly, as merely a war with Spain. The war in the

02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:18.480
Philippines is our first extended overseas conflict, our first conflict in what would

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:23.680
come to be called the developing world or third world. It's a form of counterinsurgency.

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:30.480
This is the US Army learning lessons that are then repeated again in the Second World War

02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:35.360
in Korea, Vietnam, and even after 9-11. Is the Philippines our friends or enemies

02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:37.680
in this history? Well, that's the interesting part,

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:44.240
is that the book focuses in particular on Filipinos who fight with the Americans who

02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.080
fought in the US Army and Navy over the course of the 20th century. They are in a fundamentally

02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.040
ironic position. They are from the Philippines and they're fighting for the United States,

02:01:55.680 --> 02:02:03.440
which is the colonial power occupying their country. I think that irony persists. If you

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.200
look at polling data where they ask people all around the world, do you think positively

02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:15.600
or negatively about the United States? That the highest responses are from the Philippines.

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.440
Filipinos view the United States more favorably than people from any other country in the world,

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.960
including America. They think more favorably of Americans than Americans do.

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:31.680
Unpacking that irony is part of what I'm trying to get at in the book.

02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:38.880
What was the people power revolution and what lessons can we learn from it? You assign an

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:46.640
large value to it in terms of what we can learn for the American project.

02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:54.560
In 1986, the president of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos, is overthrown by a popular

02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:00.720
revolution known as people power in the wake of a contested and probably almost certainly

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:11.680
rigged election that confirms his rule. When that is overturned through mass movements in

02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:19.760
the Philippines, it's also confirmed in many ways by the reluctance of the United States to intervene

02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.040
to prop up a Cold War ally. Ferdinand Marcos had supported American policy throughout his

02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.760
administration. The Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan's president at the time,

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:35.520
basically chooses not to support him. That's a personally wrenching decision for Reagan himself,

02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:45.200
but he's being shaped in many ways by the emerging voices of neoconservative foreign policy voices,

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:49.200
in particular, Paul Wolfowitz and the State Department and others who see

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:56.160
movements for democracy and democratization that then take fire in the late 20th century

02:03:56.160 --> 02:04:03.360
in Latin America, in South Korea, in Eastern Europe, and all around the world until

02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.400
it hits the wall in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.840
What's that wall? What do you mean by it hits the wall?

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:23.760
There are global movements for democratization, for opening up throughout the world starting in

02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:30.080
the 1980s. Obviously, they continue in Eastern Europe with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:39.840
I say it hits the wall in China with the protests in Tiananmen Square that are blocked and that are

02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:46.560
crushed and I think represent a real sort of turning point in the history of democratic

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.720
institutions on a global scale in the late 20th century. There are some places where the fight

02:04:52.720 --> 02:05:01.120
for freedom will work and some places not. That's the kind of lesson from the 20th

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:09.440
to take forward to the 21st century. No, I think the lesson is maybe one that we talked about

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:16.720
earlier that there's this dynamic dance between leaders, whether totalitarian leaders or leaders

02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:23.200
of democratic movements and the people that they're leading. Sometimes it works and sometimes

02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.880
it doesn't. Let me ask a big ridiculous question because we talked about

02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:34.080
presidential elections. Now, this is objectively, definitively, you have to answer one person who's

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.880
the greatest president in American history. Oh, that's easy. Abraham Lincoln.

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:49.520
Is that easy? Not George Washington? Washington had the statesman qualities. He understood his

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:54.560
power as the first president. Also relinquished power?

02:05:54.560 --> 02:06:04.080
He was willing to relinquish power. But Lincoln has the combination of personal leadership,

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:14.240
a fundamental moral character, and just the ability to fight the fight of politics,

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:19.120
to play the game of it and to get where he's going, to play the short game and the long game,

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:30.000
to work with his enemies, to block them when he had to. He gets the United States through

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.480
the Civil War, so you've got to give him some credit for that.

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:38.320
And he's pretty good at making speeches. Obviously, it helps that he's a remarkable

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:46.800
speaker and able to convey those kinds of visions. But he is first and foremost a politician and

02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.440
probably the best one we have. Both at getting elected and at ruling.

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:59.920
In some ways, better at the doing than at the getting elected. The election of 1860,

02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:07.440
it's just a hot mess that could have worked out many different ways. And even the election of

02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:14.000
1864, when we have a presidential election in the middle of a civil war, it was not a

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:21.760
foregone conclusion that Lincoln would be reelected. So both times, he's not a master

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:27.600
campaigner by any means, but he was a master politician as a governor.

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:35.760
Do we have leaders like that today? So one perspective is leaders aren't,

02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:40.880
ain't what they used to be. And then another perspective is, well, we always romanticize

02:07:40.880 --> 02:07:45.440
stuff that happens in the past. We forget the flaws and remember the great moments.

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:55.280
Yeah, both of those things are true. On the one hand, we are not surrounded by people of

02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:59.360
Lincoln's caliber right now. That feels like the case.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:07.120
And I think we can say that with some certainty. But I always like to point to

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:15.920
President Harry Truman, who left office with some truly abysmal presidential ratings,

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:24.320
was dismissed throughout his presidency as unqualified, as not knowing what he was doing,

02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:31.360
et cetera. And then it turns out, with hindsight, we know that he was better at the job than anyone

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:36.000
understood. Better at getting elected. You remember that sign, do he defeats Truman?

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:44.400
He showed them. And better at holding power and better at building the kind of institutions that

02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:50.160
long after he was gone, demonstrated that he won the long game.

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:59.840
And some of that is the victors do write the story. And I ask myself very much, how will history

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:07.920
remember Volodymyr Zelensky? It's not obvious. And how will history remember Putin? That, too,

02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:16.320
is not obvious. Because it depends on how the role, the geopolitics,

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:25.120
how the nations, how the history of these nations unravel, unfold, rather. So it's very interesting

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:31.040
to think about. And the same is true for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Obama,

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:42.000
George Bush, Bill Clinton, and so on. I think it's a probably unanswerable question of which

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.120
of the presidents will be remembered as a great president from this time. You can make all kinds

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:52.320
of cases for all kinds of people, and they do, but it's unclear. It's fascinating to think about.

02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.840
When the robots finally take over, which of the humans they will appreciate the most.

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:09.280
Let me ask for advice. Do you have advice for young folks? Because you mentioned the folks

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:16.160
you're teaching, they don't know what it's like to have waited on the internet for the thing to load

02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:21.280
up, for every single web page that's suffering. They don't know what it's like to not have the

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:28.480
internet and have a dial phone that goes, and then the joy of getting angry at somebody and hanging

02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:34.000
up with a physical phone. They don't know any of that. So for those young folks that look

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.200
at the contentious elections, that look at our contentious world, our divided world,

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:44.560
what advice would you give them of how to have a career they can be proud of, let's say they're

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:48.640
in college or in high school, and how to have a life they can be proud of?

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:56.000
Oh man, that's a big question. Yeah, I've never given a graduation speech.

02:10:56.880 --> 02:11:00.560
This is like warm-up. Let's look for raw materials before you write it.

02:11:01.280 --> 02:11:11.440
If I did, I think I would advise students that history teaches that you should be

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:20.160
more optimistic than your current surroundings suggest. I think it would be very easy as a young

02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:26.400
person today to think there's nothing I can do about this politics. There's nothing I can say

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:32.080
to this person on the other side of the aisle. There's nothing I can do about the planet,

02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:43.600
etc., and just sort of give up. I think history teaches that we don't know who the winners and

02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:49.440
losers are in the long run, but we know that the people who give up are always the losers.

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:55.600
So don't give in to cynicism or apathy. Optimism paves the way.

02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:03.120
Yeah, because human beings are deeply resilient and creative, even under far more difficult

02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:10.640
circumstances than we face right now. Let me ask a question that you wouldn't even

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:18.080
dare cover in your graduation commencement speech. What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?

02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:24.720
This whole project that history studies and analyzes as if there's a point to the whole

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:33.840
thing. What is the point? All the wars, all the presidents, all the struggles to discover

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:40.880
what it means to be human or reach for a higher ideal. Why? Why do you think we're here?

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:52.000
I think this is where there is often a handoff from the historian to the clergy.

02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:01.840
But in the end, there's less distance between the two than you think.

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:10.000
If you think about some of the answers to that question, what is the meaning of life that are

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:18.880
given from religious traditions, often they have a fundamentally historical core. It's about

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:26.800
unifying the past and the present in some other non-earthly dimension.

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:37.120
I think there is that. I think even for people who don't have religious belief, there's a way

02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:46.400
in which history is about the shared human condition. I think historians aspire to telling

02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:57.520
all of that story. We drill down on the miseries of war and depressions and so forth, but the story

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:05.760
is not complete without blueberries and butterflies and all the rest that go with it.

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:16.080
Both the humbling and the inspiring aspect that you get by looking back at human history that

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:23.360
we're in this together. Christopher, this is a huge honor. This is an amazing conversation.

02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.800
Thank you for taking us back to a war that not often discussed, but in many ways defined the

02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:36.320
20th century and the century we are in today, which is the First World War. The war that was

02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:42.720
supposed to end all wars, but instead defined the future wars and defines our struggle to try to

02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:48.080
avoid World War III. It's a huge honor you would talk with me today. This is amazing. Thank you so

02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:53.840
much. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Christopher Capazzola. To

02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.040
support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you some

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:06.560
words from Woodrow Wilson in 1917 about World War I that haunted the rest of the 20th century.

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:10.080
This is a war to end all wars.

02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:16.240
George Santana, a Spanish American philosopher, responded to this quote

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:21.760
in 1922 by saying, Only the dead have seen the end of war.

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:27.440
Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
