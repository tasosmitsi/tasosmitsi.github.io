00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
If I hate you, that's great, but if I have a story

00:02.320 --> 00:04.800
to support that hate, ah, that's even better.

00:04.800 --> 00:07.360
One of your favorite words, jihad.

00:07.360 --> 00:10.880
That's my favorite hobbies.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.760
It doesn't matter now who do you vote into power,

00:14.760 --> 00:16.680
they will not listen to you, they would listen

00:16.680 --> 00:18.760
to the people who paid them to be there.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.440
When the military came in, people were walking to me

00:21.440 --> 00:24.360
like pointing their fingers, like, don't speak about TCU,

00:24.360 --> 00:26.480
don't speak about the army, we love you now,

00:26.480 --> 00:29.240
but don't you, they would like that.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.400
So I called John Stewart, I was like, I don't know what to do.

00:31.400 --> 00:35.520
And he said the most interesting thing ever.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.760
He said, if you're afraid of something,

00:37.760 --> 00:41.120
make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.080
The following is a conversation with Bassem Youssef,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.880
a legendary Egyptian-American comedian,

00:49.880 --> 00:52.960
the so-called John Stewart of the Middle East,

00:52.960 --> 00:56.400
who fearlessly satirized those in power,

00:56.440 --> 00:59.720
even when his job and life were on the line.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.120
Bassem is a beautiful human being.

01:02.120 --> 01:05.280
It was truly a pleasure for me to get to know him

01:05.280 --> 01:08.400
and to have this fun, fascinating,

01:08.400 --> 01:11.080
and challenging conversation.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.120
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.000
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:15.000 --> 01:16.280
in the description.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.080
And now, dear friends, here's Bassem Youssef.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.680
Your wife is half Palestinian,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.560
and I've heard you say they've been trying to kill her,

01:26.560 --> 01:28.440
but she keeps using the kids as human shields.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.840
So have you considered negotiating a ceasefire?

01:31.840 --> 01:36.280
Well, the thing is, every day, every minute of the day

01:36.280 --> 01:38.600
in a married life is a negotiation.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.480
Everything can blow up into a full-scale war,

01:42.480 --> 01:45.600
starting from a simple sentence like, good morning.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
What should we do with the kids today?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.680
What should we do with that piece of furniture?

01:50.680 --> 01:53.240
Any sentence can lead you to heaven

01:53.240 --> 01:54.680
or to hell at the same time.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.200
So you do negotiate with terrorists?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.040
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%.

01:57.040 --> 01:57.880
You must?

01:57.880 --> 02:01.480
Yeah, and for her, I am her terrorist too, so it's equal.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.720
Terrorists on both sides.

02:03.720 --> 02:04.760
On a more serious note,

02:04.760 --> 02:07.280
when you found out about the attacks of October 7th,

02:07.280 --> 02:08.560
what went through your mind?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.440
If I'm allowed to use a curse word, I was like-

02:11.440 --> 02:12.280
As many as possible.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.840
I was like, oh shit.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.320
Part of my stand-up comedy is I describe a situation

02:17.320 --> 02:20.080
where I was in a restaurant with producers

02:20.080 --> 02:22.120
and there was a bombing two blocks away

02:22.120 --> 02:25.400
in Chelsea, New York in 2016.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.600
And of course, this is the like,

02:28.600 --> 02:31.040
damn, what's gonna happen to us now?

02:31.040 --> 02:33.440
And there's like two different reactions.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.000
There's the white reaction, which is like,

02:35.000 --> 02:36.320
oh my God, I hope nobody is hurt.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.160
This is terrible.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.000
I hope everybody's okay.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
And there's the Arab reaction.

02:39.000 --> 02:39.840
What's his name?

02:39.840 --> 02:40.680
What is his name?

02:40.680 --> 02:41.840
What is the name?

02:41.840 --> 02:44.360
Because you know what's gonna come?

02:44.360 --> 02:47.280
It's kind of, I was scared

02:47.280 --> 02:50.160
of what's gonna really happen in that area.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.120
And it's like, oh my God, it's gonna be horrible.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.400
And the way that it was reported,

02:56.520 --> 02:58.400
I didn't know how to handle this.

02:58.400 --> 03:01.600
So I basically, I went into hiding for a few days,

03:01.600 --> 03:02.800
three or four days.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.040
And I talked about Piers Morgan team talking to me

03:07.040 --> 03:07.880
two times, three times.

03:07.880 --> 03:08.720
I was like, no, I can't.

03:08.720 --> 03:09.720
How can you defend that?

03:09.720 --> 03:10.680
How can you defend the rape,

03:10.680 --> 03:12.160
the decapitated babies and whatever?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.240
And then I started kind of looking in the news

03:14.240 --> 03:15.080
a little bit.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.040
And I started seeing people coming on the shows

03:18.040 --> 03:20.280
and saying things that I know as an Arab,

03:20.280 --> 03:23.280
as a Muslim, as someone from that region

03:23.280 --> 03:24.600
that it's not true.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.080
But I didn't know what to say, how to say it.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.000
So I said, by the third time when they asked me,

03:32.000 --> 03:34.280
I said, like, fine, put me on.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.160
And I went there, it was more of a,

03:37.240 --> 03:39.920
figuratively speaking, a suicide mission.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.960
And because it's a lose-lose situation.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.360
I can lose stuff in Hollywood.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.720
I can, I even, I remember my managers like,

03:47.720 --> 03:49.840
Bassem, be careful.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.800
I mean, are you sure you wanna do it?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.400
My managers was like, please don't do it.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.720
Please don't do it.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.680
And on the other side, if I don't perform well,

03:57.680 --> 04:02.680
whatever well means, I'm gonna be rejected by my own people.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.920
So it was a lose-lose situation

04:04.920 --> 04:06.800
because whatever I say, it will never be enough.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.280
And whatever I say will not be good enough.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.640
And I was going into there

04:11.640 --> 04:15.720
and I felt that I was going into a trance

04:15.720 --> 04:18.720
for the 33 minutes that I was on the,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.200
on that interview for the first time.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.040
You blacked out.

04:21.040 --> 04:22.040
I blacked out.

04:22.040 --> 04:22.880
I blacked out.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.000
And a lot of people ask me,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.920
is the earpiece was that a bit

04:26.920 --> 04:27.960
when the earpiece kept falling?

04:27.960 --> 04:31.200
It's like, no, it was really falling off

04:31.200 --> 04:32.400
and it disconnected.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.040
And I had to save it because I cannot see them.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.480
All I can hear, I can just hear them.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.080
And I could expect it at any time.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.120
Okay, Bassem, thank you.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.880
I was fighting for every second to say words,

04:43.880 --> 04:44.880
to put stuff in there.

04:44.880 --> 04:45.880
Yeah, for people who don't know,

04:45.880 --> 04:50.040
this is your conversation interview with Piers Morgan.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.800
And you couldn't see.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.640
I couldn't see, I was just like,

04:52.640 --> 04:53.960
the lens for the camera.

04:53.960 --> 04:54.800
And I was just like-

04:54.800 --> 04:56.120
It was like a surreal dream or nightmare.

04:56.120 --> 04:57.320
Yeah, hello, Bassem.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.160
I was like, hello, Bassem.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.000
I was like, hi.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.520
And it could end at any moment.

05:01.520 --> 05:02.800
Your career and everything.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.320
Everything, yeah, yeah.

05:04.320 --> 05:08.360
So what was the drive that got you to actually do it,

05:08.360 --> 05:10.640
to overcome that fear?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.000
Multiple things.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.920
First of all, I don't wanna say it's just my wife's family

05:15.920 --> 05:17.520
because my wife's family has always been there.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.760
But this time was different.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.480
The bombing, the attack,

05:21.480 --> 05:23.560
they're usually one of those people

05:23.560 --> 05:25.000
that they're away for everything.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.440
Whatever happened in Gaza, they are always in safe places.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.160
But this time, it seems that there was no place safe.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.400
And already we heard about like two or three

05:33.400 --> 05:38.000
of the cousins and the uncles already lost their home.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.160
So this was too much.

05:39.160 --> 05:43.600
So I wanted to say something for those people

05:43.600 --> 05:47.200
because I know that I made one of the jokes

05:47.200 --> 05:49.960
that I made about like, oh, it's Hassan, her cousin.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.240
He's a loser.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.520
He's a doctor.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.600
He's a doctor.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.840
And every time a hospital was bombed,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.800
we were worried about him.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.280
So I wanted to say that because I felt

06:01.280 --> 06:04.640
that this is a family that I have never seen in my life.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.720
I have never, she actually hardly saw an uncle or two

06:08.680 --> 06:10.560
because they cannot leave.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.160
But I said like, I need to speak.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.600
At least I do something for those extended family

06:16.600 --> 06:17.640
that I have never known.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.640
But also because when Piers Morgan team called me

06:23.240 --> 06:24.560
a couple of times, I said, okay,

06:24.560 --> 06:26.080
let's see what's going on in the show.

06:26.080 --> 06:29.160
And I just watched the stuff and the lies

06:29.160 --> 06:33.560
and the one sided reporting that made my blood boil.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.760
And then I thought like, what am I afraid of?

06:36.760 --> 06:39.720
I'm afraid of, if I say something,

06:39.720 --> 06:40.560
I can lose my career.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.800
It's like, wait a minute.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.480
But that was the reason why I left Egypt.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.720
I said, wait, I left Egypt.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.960
I came to United States.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.240
I came to the land of the free

06:48.240 --> 06:50.120
where I can say anything I want.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.920
And yet I have limitation of what to say.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.720
I mean, I thought we left that shit behind.

06:55.720 --> 06:56.960
I mean, what's happening?

06:56.960 --> 07:00.760
And I understand the connection of like how sensitive it is

07:00.760 --> 07:03.120
when you speak about Israel

07:03.120 --> 07:06.360
and all of the ready-made accusations.

07:06.440 --> 07:10.040
But as an Arab, as a Muslim, I don't react the same

07:10.040 --> 07:12.520
when you talk about Saudi Arabia or Iran or Egypt

07:12.520 --> 07:13.360
or any of them.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.280
It's like, hey, you want this?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.840
Some of these countries, I'll do that with you

07:17.840 --> 07:19.680
because I have strong opinions about what happened

07:19.680 --> 07:21.920
and I already been expressing them.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.160
But when I talk about, that's why I speak.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.360
And there's a lot of Jewish people who come to my show

07:26.360 --> 07:27.400
and they understand that.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.320
They understand that the separation

07:30.320 --> 07:33.040
but that kind of grouping of blackmailing people

07:33.040 --> 07:35.360
and saying and not saying what they have in their mind,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.640
it is that kind of like one of the things

07:37.640 --> 07:40.760
that kind of like pushed me to go on the show.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.120
The thing that was bothering you

07:42.120 --> 07:46.000
was that what was being said or how it was being said?

07:46.000 --> 07:50.400
Both, because there are lies, which is usually in the media

07:50.400 --> 07:55.040
but there was the total disregard of humanity.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.280
You talk a lot about in your show about human suffering

07:59.240 --> 08:03.240
and I felt that here the human suffering was not equal.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.960
I felt that's why I came up with this like,

08:05.960 --> 08:07.920
what's the exchange rate today?

08:07.920 --> 08:10.040
What's the exchange rate today?

08:10.040 --> 08:14.280
There's, of course, it's terrible to see anybody die

08:14.280 --> 08:19.280
but I feel that like, isn't our life not worth anything?

08:20.400 --> 08:24.200
Yeah, you had a chart that came to crypto

08:24.200 --> 08:25.520
from an investment, you analyze it

08:25.520 --> 08:27.040
from an investing perspective, of course,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.120
in a dark human kind.

08:28.120 --> 08:28.960
ROI on that.

08:28.960 --> 08:29.800
ROI.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.040
And you were saying that a certain year was a good year.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.160
Yeah, 2014.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.520
2014 was a good year for investment purposes

08:38.520 --> 08:41.240
and also to refer to the family member

08:41.240 --> 08:42.600
that you called a loser.

08:42.600 --> 08:45.160
You were saying that, you called him,

08:45.160 --> 08:47.080
had a conversation with him and he keeps saying

08:47.080 --> 08:49.280
that he's not using anybody for human shields

08:49.280 --> 08:50.880
and then you called him a loser.

08:50.880 --> 08:51.720
You can't even give a job.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.400
The liar, he lied to us because I have to believe,

08:54.400 --> 08:56.080
but this is the one thing, it's like,

08:56.080 --> 08:59.160
it's also one of the things like how it was said.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.080
It was stuff that I've been hearing.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.880
I don't know what turned on in my head,

09:03.880 --> 09:05.880
but it's stuff that I've been hearing all my life

09:05.880 --> 09:06.920
from the media.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.760
Israel warns civilians before bombing them

09:09.760 --> 09:13.040
and that's okay, but that's not okay.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.960
Israel is trying to minimize the civilians

09:14.960 --> 09:17.160
but killing them anyway and that's okay,

09:17.160 --> 09:18.600
but that's not okay.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.520
So it is kind of like the indoctrination

09:20.520 --> 09:23.640
that we've been hearing as if it is okay

09:23.640 --> 09:27.280
and then suddenly it's not.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.560
Yeah, there's a kind of several layers of bullshit,

09:31.560 --> 09:36.560
almost sometimes hiding the obvious horror of the situation

09:37.800 --> 09:40.560
with kind of politeness and all this kind of stuff.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.560
Just the basic value of human life.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.520
That said, it's a difficult situation.

09:44.520 --> 09:45.720
It is, it is.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.200
What would you do if you were Israel?

09:47.200 --> 09:50.720
BB called you, awesome, big fan, big fan of your comedy.

09:52.240 --> 09:53.480
First of all, would you hang up right away

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
or would you hear him out?

09:54.480 --> 09:55.880
No, I'll definitely hear him out.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.240
That's like, that was like, wait a minute,

09:58.240 --> 10:01.680
that's material, that's material, that's material, man.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.440
I was like, so Netanyahu called me.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.440
I was sitting with my family, just like I have on my phone

10:06.440 --> 10:08.680
and I was like, oh, Netanyahu.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.800
Yeah, it just shows up that way.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.800
I mean, what would you do?

10:11.800 --> 10:13.400
What would you do in this situation?

10:13.400 --> 10:14.880
To answer this question,

10:14.880 --> 10:16.800
we need to understand how Israel thinks.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.560
There is an incredible speech given by Gideon Levy

10:20.560 --> 10:24.680
at a famous Israeli report in Haaretz

10:24.680 --> 10:28.400
and he describes a situation where he was in the West Bank

10:28.400 --> 10:30.200
and there was a checkpoint.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.480
And in that checkpoint, there was an ambulance

10:32.480 --> 10:34.440
with a Palestinian patient

10:34.440 --> 10:39.440
and it was there sitting for an hour and a half, not moving.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.360
And then he went to talk to the soldiers,

10:42.360 --> 10:45.000
like guys, why are you not letting them go?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.840
It's like, ah, let them go.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.560
And then he told them, imagine if he was your father

10:50.560 --> 10:54.440
and the soldiers stood up, it's like, what?

10:54.440 --> 10:55.800
These are pigs.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.680
These are not humans.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.040
So when you tell me what would you do if Israel would do,

11:01.040 --> 11:02.640
it really needs to, we need to ask,

11:02.640 --> 11:04.560
how does Israel look at the Palestinian

11:04.560 --> 11:05.680
and view the Palestinians

11:05.680 --> 11:08.560
because they do look at them less than human.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.440
And there is an incredible talk by Micheal Meyer.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.320
He was a Holocaust survivor.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.960
And he said, I learned in Auschwitz

11:15.960 --> 11:17.760
when I was there in the concentration camp

11:17.760 --> 11:20.080
that in order for a dominant group of people

11:20.080 --> 11:22.040
to dehumanize another group,

11:22.040 --> 11:24.360
they need first to dehumanize themselves.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.680
And Israel looks at Palestinians as lesser people,

11:29.680 --> 11:34.680
as lesser beings, as some people who are dispensable.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.880
And the way that they treat them

11:37.880 --> 11:40.360
is that they don't really care about like,

11:40.360 --> 11:42.640
that's why they exchange faith thing.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.280
So for me, if I am Israel, it will be like,

11:45.280 --> 11:47.760
what would you do if you're the United States

11:47.760 --> 11:49.600
in the time of the Native Americans?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.920
They were killing people with the millions.

11:52.800 --> 11:53.640
When you dehumanize a group of people,

11:53.640 --> 11:54.680
you really don't care.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.880
So if I was Israel, I would do exactly

11:57.880 --> 11:59.200
what Israel is doing right now

11:59.200 --> 12:02.080
because there's no one is holding me accountable.

12:02.080 --> 12:03.800
There is no one stopping me.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.680
And I can get whatever I want

12:05.680 --> 12:08.040
throughout my history through violence.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.520
I think a lot of the things you just said

12:09.520 --> 12:12.680
are a tiny bit slightly exaggerated.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.400
So let me try, let's try.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.640
So not everybody in Israel.

12:17.800 --> 12:22.240
So let's look at several groups.

12:22.240 --> 12:26.480
So people in government, IDF soldiers,

12:26.480 --> 12:30.080
and citizens that are neither of those.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.640
And not everybody of any of those

12:33.600 --> 12:37.840
sees Palestinians as less than human, just some percentage.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.600
So what percentage is that in your sense?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.240
It's the people who have the power.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.240
So it's mostly the focus of your commentary.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.480
When you say people in Israel,

12:45.480 --> 12:47.360
you really mean the people in power.

12:48.320 --> 12:51.400
But as much as, of course, I mean the people of power

12:51.400 --> 12:52.560
because when I speak about,

12:52.560 --> 12:53.760
even when I speak about America,

12:53.760 --> 12:54.800
I speak about people in power.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.760
When I speak about Egypt, I speak the people of power

12:56.760 --> 12:58.040
because I can't really talk about

12:58.040 --> 12:59.560
the 100 million people in Egypt

12:59.560 --> 13:01.080
or the 11 million people in Israel.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.720
Of course, there are people who go in

13:02.720 --> 13:04.280
and they demonstrate against Netanyahu

13:04.280 --> 13:05.640
and they want him out of the government.

13:05.640 --> 13:08.480
But we have to admit that the Israeli society

13:08.480 --> 13:11.760
as a whole have moved quite a bit to the right

13:11.760 --> 13:14.120
and has been many extreme.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.720
And you know what happens when you go to the right

13:16.720 --> 13:18.280
or you go to the most extreme,

13:18.280 --> 13:20.200
the other person go to the most extreme.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.200
And extremism breeds extremism.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.240
So thank you for the clarification,

13:25.240 --> 13:27.880
but like I really meant with the people of power.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.080
When people criticize the United States

13:30.080 --> 13:32.840
for going in Iraq, of course I'm not criticizing citizens.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.320
But you made another point, which is an interesting point

13:35.320 --> 13:37.760
and it's very difficult to see in the heart of people.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.600
But I wonder if you look at the average Palestinian

13:40.600 --> 13:42.600
and the average Israeli,

13:42.600 --> 13:44.560
and when they look at the other,

13:44.560 --> 13:49.200
do they have some hate in their heart?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.680
Well, everybody probably has some.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.280
What is that amount?

13:53.280 --> 13:54.920
You know, when you look at a person

13:54.920 --> 13:57.880
that looks different than you, how much hate is there?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.880
It depends on what is the specific situation

13:59.880 --> 14:00.720
of each person.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.680
So in the Berlin Film Festival,

14:02.680 --> 14:04.880
just like a few, couple of weeks ago,

14:04.880 --> 14:06.280
there was an Israeli and a Palestinian

14:06.280 --> 14:09.000
receiving an award together.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.760
And the Israeli director said,

14:10.760 --> 14:12.440
we're gonna go back to Israel.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.800
He's gonna go to the West Bank.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.760
You will have no rights and I will have full living rights.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.120
These people managed to work together and be friends

14:21.120 --> 14:23.800
and they have empathy to each other.

14:23.800 --> 14:28.360
Now, the average Palestinian,

14:29.320 --> 14:30.960
it's a very difficult question

14:30.960 --> 14:33.280
because is it the Palestinian diaspora

14:33.280 --> 14:36.400
or the Palestinian in Gaza or the diaspora in the West Bank

14:36.400 --> 14:39.160
or the one in the citizen, as a citizen of Israel

14:39.160 --> 14:40.200
who still have less right

14:40.200 --> 14:42.320
than a Roman citizen of Israel than a Jew.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.880
And it really depends if I am,

14:45.880 --> 14:48.840
there are people in Arabs in Israel

14:48.840 --> 14:50.600
who are having a great life.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.800
And there are people Arabs who are having a miserable life.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.760
But definitely people that living in Gaza or in the West Bank

14:56.760 --> 15:00.640
is kind of like on the lower tier of their living conditions.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.520
Now let's talk about the hate.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.160
What does that Palestinian see with whom the Israeli?

15:06.160 --> 15:08.600
The Palestinian see oppression, limitation of movement,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.360
limitation of freedom.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.400
And then when there's something happens,

15:13.400 --> 15:17.560
you see the full force coming in, destroying their home,

15:17.560 --> 15:19.360
taking away members of his family.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.760
There would be absolutely no reason

15:20.760 --> 15:22.720
for him to love the other.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.320
The Israeli, because he doesn't have the power

15:26.320 --> 15:27.880
but he lives under his government,

15:27.880 --> 15:29.760
all he sees is the rockets or whatever,

15:29.760 --> 15:31.720
but like he sees the reaction

15:31.720 --> 15:33.960
and he doesn't see what happened to those.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.600
And as humans, we are selfish.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.280
We see what really affects us as humans.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.840
And I cannot even imagine

15:40.840 --> 15:43.520
what it would be like to live as a Palestinian.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.040
And I'm not even talking about Gaza

15:45.040 --> 15:47.240
because everybody talks about Gaza.

15:47.240 --> 15:48.480
But let me give you an example.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.920
And I'm not gonna talk about the 12,000 kids killed in Gaza.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.120
Let's talk about just like the four weeks in the West Bank.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.520
March 4th, Amr Al-Najjar, age 10,

16:01.520 --> 16:03.040
sitting next to his father,

16:03.040 --> 16:06.200
shot while he's sitting in a car next to his father

16:06.200 --> 16:08.240
by the IDF soldiers.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.680
Mohammed Ziad, 13 years old, March 3rd,

16:12.680 --> 16:14.640
shot in front of a UN school

16:14.640 --> 16:16.600
while he's sitting with his friends.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.840
Mohammed Ghanem, age 15, March 2nd,

16:20.840 --> 16:23.720
he's shot while standing in front of a storefront

16:23.720 --> 16:25.440
during a night raid.

16:26.480 --> 16:31.240
February 23rd, Saeed Jardal, he was killed by a drone fire.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.240
February 22nd, Fadi Suleiman, killed

16:34.240 --> 16:37.240
while standing in front of the top of a Red Cross building.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.400
Nihil Ziad, February 14th, Valentine's Day,

16:42.400 --> 16:45.560
killed a shot in the head while leaving school.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.280
February 11th, Mohammed Khattour, US citizens,

16:49.280 --> 16:52.400
killed while being in a parked car.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.720
And Muad Shams, February 9th,

16:55.720 --> 16:57.800
killed right in front of his home

16:57.800 --> 17:00.920
because a military car came reversing back to him

17:00.920 --> 17:02.800
and then somebody opened the door,

17:02.800 --> 17:04.840
shot him and leave.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.280
This is the daily life of people in the West Bank.

17:07.280 --> 17:10.160
What is the justification that IDF provides?

17:11.320 --> 17:12.160
Terrorism.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.360
Terrorism.

17:14.360 --> 17:15.720
Or I don't know, I mean,

17:15.720 --> 17:18.200
you cannot really say like human shields,

17:18.200 --> 17:19.840
but they will say that they were throwing rocks.

17:19.840 --> 17:22.640
There was a guy who went on Chris Rock

17:22.640 --> 17:24.360
and he said like, his son, a US citizen,

17:24.360 --> 17:25.960
would kill and it's like, they were throwing rocks.

17:25.960 --> 17:26.800
So we killed him.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.720
Even when they were throwing rocks, you kill him.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.840
But the thing is, you see, this is how easy for them

17:31.840 --> 17:33.080
to get rid of Palestinians.

17:33.080 --> 17:36.520
I mean, I love, like, I was,

17:36.520 --> 17:38.520
I had to say I prepared a little bit for the podcast

17:38.520 --> 17:40.320
because you are in tech.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.520
So, and I am ignorant in tech.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.280
There is a movie called The Lab.

17:45.280 --> 17:49.720
It is directed by an Israeli director called Yutam Feldman.

17:49.720 --> 17:54.720
And he talks about how the military industry

17:54.800 --> 17:56.480
in Israel is very advanced.

17:57.440 --> 18:00.600
And what is really mind boggling is in that movie,

18:00.600 --> 18:05.320
he shows how the military tests its weapons in the field

18:05.320 --> 18:07.120
and urban areas from Palestinians.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.600
It is heartbreaking.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.160
As a doctor, there is five stages of trials.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.960
There is like, there is discovery, preclinical, clinical,

18:17.960 --> 18:22.960
and then market and then post-market evaluation by the FDA,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.400
FDA value approval, and then the FDA post-market.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.680
Five, just to take a pill.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.920
And you go in and he interviews people as like,

18:31.920 --> 18:33.640
where did you test this?

18:33.640 --> 18:35.800
And they test it in the field.

18:35.800 --> 18:40.800
So, when you just like, when human life is so cheap

18:42.280 --> 18:46.640
and it is so indispensable, it made me,

18:46.640 --> 18:49.200
it gave me a visceral reaction.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.240
Because, you know, we as humans,

18:51.240 --> 18:55.400
this has been actually the state of humanity.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.520
Humanity have lived and survived

18:58.520 --> 19:00.720
and thrived by actually killing each other.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.240
But there was kind of a, we were remotely,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.880
we were removed from it.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.280
People in Greece didn't know

19:06.280 --> 19:08.320
what the Alexander the Great was doing.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.560
He was killing and pillaging and like,

19:09.560 --> 19:11.840
we call him the great because, but he was killing.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.360
He was conquering, he was invading.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.760
Julius Caesar, all of the greats, he was doing,

19:16.760 --> 19:18.880
but killing was difficult.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.480
Killing had to have some sort,

19:20.480 --> 19:21.840
you have to be with your enemy.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.240
Then you go back, catapults, then cannons,

19:25.240 --> 19:26.800
then a little bit back,

19:26.800 --> 19:28.480
and then you're kind of like shining remotely.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.120
Now you're killing people behind the screen

19:30.120 --> 19:32.760
with a button, with a push of a button, you know?

19:32.760 --> 19:34.200
A lot of people say terrorism,

19:34.200 --> 19:35.800
they killed you with a knife,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.480
killed one person with a knife, shot you.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.440
That's terrorism.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.480
But if you fly a $64 million F-16

19:41.480 --> 19:46.080
and you drop up in an A-84 bomb that cost $16,000,

19:46.080 --> 19:47.920
that's not terrorism because it's removed.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.080
You're behind the screen.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.960
So what happened, what Israel is doing?

19:50.960 --> 19:54.800
It is removing itself, like America too, drones.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.040
And then when you push someone to be in,

19:58.040 --> 20:00.640
they always brag about bombing them to the Stone Ages.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.360
What happens when the screens

20:04.360 --> 20:08.160
and all of the obstacles that you have been put between you

20:08.160 --> 20:11.080
and those people that you have treated them this way,

20:11.080 --> 20:14.120
when this is a breach and you come face to face,

20:14.120 --> 20:17.520
you will come face to face with what you have created.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.560
Yeah, there's a lot of interesting things you just said.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.160
So one is the methodology of killing.

20:23.160 --> 20:28.080
If you wanna look at some horrific, large-scale killing,

20:28.080 --> 20:30.400
people often talk about the Holocaust.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.480
But that's visceral.

20:32.480 --> 20:35.320
You can look at Hollermor by Stalin,

20:35.320 --> 20:37.120
where the murder is through starvation.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.600
By Churchill in India.

20:39.600 --> 20:44.600
In Churchill in India, and the great leap forward by Mao.

20:46.480 --> 20:51.080
So starvation is a thing we don't often think of it

20:51.080 --> 20:54.680
as murder because it's quiet, it's slow.

20:54.680 --> 20:57.040
And the interesting thing about starvation

20:57.040 --> 21:00.280
is that the people don't complain as they're dying

21:01.160 --> 21:02.480
or they're exhausted.

21:02.480 --> 21:03.320
That's one.

21:03.320 --> 21:06.280
And the other is the value of human life.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.800
It does seem that every culture

21:09.800 --> 21:14.160
has an unequal valuation of human life.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.280
So those two things combined create

21:17.160 --> 21:22.040
a complicated military landscape of the world.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.400
Yes, but the thing is,

21:24.400 --> 21:28.280
is that how we would look at technology as the savior,

21:28.520 --> 21:31.040
we talk about how AI disrupt, will disrupt,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.680
will disrupt, will disrupt.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.880
And now if you go, you talk about like going

21:34.880 --> 21:38.280
to the West Bank, the people in the West Bank walk

21:38.280 --> 21:39.760
and they don't see humans.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.400
They see people shouting them from towers

21:41.400 --> 21:43.000
or behind the screens or doing,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.400
and they have like biometrics that is developed

21:45.400 --> 21:48.200
by Basel system, like that's done by HP

21:48.200 --> 21:52.520
or Google and Amazon who are like part of Project Nimbus.

21:52.520 --> 21:57.360
And you see Indivision developing all of this,

21:57.360 --> 22:00.440
like metric and surveillance and all of that stuff.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.720
And then you have like something like the gospel

22:02.720 --> 22:04.520
that like people have actually said that the gospel

22:04.520 --> 22:08.480
can actually create a target list using AI

22:08.480 --> 22:12.440
and give you a green, yellow or a red to go ahead.

22:12.440 --> 22:15.440
And now AI is not just disrupting the market,

22:15.440 --> 22:17.440
it's disrupting our humanity.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.480
And it is, we became so comfortable killing people

22:20.480 --> 22:23.440
from afar, killing people with a push of the button.

22:23.440 --> 22:27.960
And now it is like, it's like dating apps.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.320
You know, when you swipe left and right,

22:30.320 --> 22:34.080
and it's like, oh, right, it becomes so like cheap.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.200
It's not like meeting someone.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.760
It's like, ah, it's like a lot of fish in the sea.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.360
Same with AI, boom, 500 people killed, boom, they killed.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.000
It's so easy, it's so easy, it's so easy.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.560
And then it's so far removed from you.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.600
So when you put these people in this condition,

22:49.600 --> 22:51.960
you have literally put them in a different universe

22:51.960 --> 22:52.800
than yours.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.600
You are behind in your condition screens,

22:55.600 --> 22:57.960
like pushing them, blowing up a university.

22:57.960 --> 22:58.800
It's amazing.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.880
But then you meet what you have done,

23:02.880 --> 23:05.480
that you meet the Frankenstein that you have created.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.440
And then people are like, oh, look what they did to us.

23:07.440 --> 23:12.320
You just gave me this image of a dating app from hell

23:12.320 --> 23:13.640
where leaders are just sitting there

23:13.640 --> 23:15.320
and kind of swiping left and right.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.240
Invade, destroy.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.480
This is boring.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.320
Puppet government.

23:20.320 --> 23:24.360
Yeah, and then turn off the phone, go to sleep.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.320
So I traveled to the West Bank

23:26.320 --> 23:27.720
and I mentioned to you offline

23:27.720 --> 23:30.360
that I really loved the people there.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.720
I've met a bunch of people like that in Eastern Europe

23:36.720 --> 23:37.560
where I grew up.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.160
Yeah, like the flamboyant, the big personalities,

23:42.160 --> 23:43.000
all of that.

23:44.080 --> 23:49.080
I also met a person who's in charge of a refugee camp

23:51.160 --> 23:53.160
who was shot by an IDF soldier.

23:54.120 --> 23:58.480
And I'm not sure the words he said are important

23:58.480 --> 24:01.760
as the consequences of the thing that you mentioned,

24:01.760 --> 24:04.880
which is the deep hate in his eyes.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.720
That didn't feel repairable at all.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.000
It was pain, it was like a foundation of pain

24:11.000 --> 24:12.880
and on top of that, a hatred.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.480
And I was like, wow, this is what.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.000
You kill one person, this is what you create.

24:19.920 --> 24:24.240
Because we have kind of like a front row seat

24:24.240 --> 24:25.680
to what's happening.

24:25.680 --> 24:29.320
We think we're in it, but we can't really grasp it.

24:29.320 --> 24:31.560
I mean, people's like, oh, we're just gonna go in,

24:31.560 --> 24:33.960
get Hamas out and we're gonna get them back in.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.240
And I don't want the people to get back in.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.880
How do you think they would look at you?

24:38.880 --> 24:40.000
What have you created?

24:41.200 --> 24:42.200
What have you done?

24:44.160 --> 24:46.640
My show in Egypt was all about propaganda.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.440
It's all about the use of words.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.320
Words are very important.

24:50.320 --> 24:54.320
The decapitated babies were not chosen randomly

24:55.920 --> 25:00.320
because you see, it plants a certain image in your brain.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.360
Imagine if you're going in, what a baby can do.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.880
It can smile, cry and poop, that's it.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.720
It's absolutely no threat.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.560
So when you tell people 40 decapitated babies,

25:09.560 --> 25:12.360
they are so animalistic, they didn't see the babies.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.360
Women raped, of course, it's an animal to do that.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.680
And they would go through that

25:17.680 --> 25:21.960
and they would, what was very frustrating

25:21.960 --> 25:25.440
about the conversation is the geish galloping.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.960
The geish galloping, throwing, you see the distractions?

25:28.960 --> 25:29.800
You see what happens?

25:29.800 --> 25:31.640
Like it's like, what's the proportionate response?

25:31.640 --> 25:33.040
Can Israel defend itself?

25:33.040 --> 25:34.160
Do you condemn Hamas?

25:34.160 --> 25:35.600
Does Israel has the right to exist?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.800
Decapitated babies, raped women.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.800
Why don't the Arab countries take them?

25:39.800 --> 25:42.360
Why don't the Muslims kill Muslims?

25:42.360 --> 25:45.240
Look what happened in Yemen, in Syria, in Iraq.

25:45.280 --> 25:47.480
See how they kind of distract you.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.360
They throw little things at you.

25:49.360 --> 25:50.600
So you don't know what to do.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.080
Oh, the honor war, the UNN, anti-Semitic,

25:53.080 --> 25:55.200
October 7th, October 7th, October 7th.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.600
And then suddenly you are distracted

25:58.600 --> 26:01.240
and pulled into discussing all of these little things.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.200
And you're not discussing what's happening right now.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.520
It is basically stalling,

26:04.520 --> 26:05.960
giving them time to do what they do.

26:05.960 --> 26:09.280
So there's some degree to the propaganda,

26:09.280 --> 26:12.320
so the beheaded babies and all this kind of stuff

26:12.320 --> 26:16.560
that is so over the top

26:16.560 --> 26:18.680
that it shuts down actual conversation

26:18.680 --> 26:23.280
about actual wrongs, war crimes on both sides.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.800
So it's overstating it to where everyone on social media

26:26.800 --> 26:28.880
and everywhere in the press and everywhere is arguing,

26:28.880 --> 26:32.480
almost become desensitized to actual horrors of death,

26:32.480 --> 26:33.920
which are more mundane.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.920
They're not so dramatic as beheaded babies.

26:35.920 --> 26:39.560
Because people, a baby is shot, but decaminated babies.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.160
There's like a knife blade that goes into the skin

26:43.000 --> 26:46.640
and the trachea, the flesh, the spine, decaminated.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.280
You can just like, he's dead.

26:48.280 --> 26:51.160
No, you go in, this is the hate, so much hate.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.320
And you know, that's why you have made me laugh

26:53.320 --> 26:57.880
at the darkest shit.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.520
You're such a beautiful person.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.880
Your dark humor is just wonderful.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.600
But you see, this happened to Jews before.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.680
Remember blood libel?

27:04.680 --> 27:06.000
Where did the blood libel come from?

27:06.000 --> 27:10.480
It comes from these rumors that Jews suck babies' blood.

27:10.480 --> 27:11.320
This is what they did to them.

27:11.480 --> 27:12.320
What's in the cup?

27:14.320 --> 27:15.600
That's a very delicious baby.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.640
Delicious baby blood.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.480
But this is what you do.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.240
You tell people something,

27:19.240 --> 27:20.680
and it happened with the Native Americans

27:20.680 --> 27:22.120
when they were here, when they went in

27:22.120 --> 27:23.920
and they wipe a whole tribe.

27:23.920 --> 27:28.200
So, and Jewish people, one of the minorities

27:28.200 --> 27:31.000
that were persecuted and had this used against them

27:31.000 --> 27:33.160
for a very long time, and it is terrible

27:33.160 --> 27:35.320
and it's terrifying that it's been used again.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.920
So I just did a very lengthy debate on Israel and Palestine.

27:39.280 --> 27:42.600
And the really painful thing from that,

27:42.600 --> 27:46.760
those two historians, it was deep, it was thorough,

27:46.760 --> 27:47.960
it was fascinating.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.400
But in constantly asking about sources of hope

27:53.400 --> 27:55.200
or solutions, there was none.

27:56.080 --> 28:00.320
There was a sense of like a really dark sense

28:00.320 --> 28:03.280
of it's hopeless from both sides.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.320
It's hopeless.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.000
So, you know, I look to you.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.440
For a source of hope.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.440
Do you have, is there any hope here?

28:15.440 --> 28:18.520
Solutions, short-term, long-term?

28:18.520 --> 28:22.760
Obama have kind of summarized this beautifully in his book.

28:22.760 --> 28:27.280
He said, the reason why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

28:27.280 --> 28:31.720
is so chronic is one side has so much power

28:31.720 --> 28:34.280
and the other side have absolutely no power.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.520
And that's why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict

28:37.600 --> 28:38.800
is so severe.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.640
And that's what Obama said.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.080
He said, like, you have Israel

28:41.080 --> 28:43.400
that basically don't listen to us

28:43.400 --> 28:44.880
because they're supported by people

28:44.880 --> 28:45.960
who are bigger than the president,

28:45.960 --> 28:46.800
bigger than the administration.

28:46.800 --> 28:47.640
They know that they can.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.840
I mean, like Netanyahu was a cotton tape

28:50.840 --> 28:52.760
many times saying, like, he's basically

28:52.760 --> 28:53.920
like belittling Americans.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.520
Like, we control 80% of the population.

28:56.520 --> 28:57.640
We don't care.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.400
This has kind of like nonchalant kind of like,

29:00.400 --> 29:01.400
we have them.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.480
And there's nothing really that compels Israel

29:06.480 --> 29:07.320
to give up anything

29:08.080 --> 29:08.920
because at the end of the day, what is compromise?

29:08.920 --> 29:11.160
Compromise is like, I give something, you give something.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.040
Israel's not giving anything.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.440
And they project that on you.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.680
So for example, how many times have we heard like,

29:17.680 --> 29:19.960
oh, Palestinians were giving like four, five, six, seven,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.040
15 chances and they said no to them.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.640
And yet when you read the history,

29:23.640 --> 29:25.480
that's not the case at all.

29:25.480 --> 29:29.800
Like, for example, in 2000, the whole idea about like,

29:29.800 --> 29:32.080
Arafat walked away from Oslo.

29:32.080 --> 29:32.920
That didn't happen.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.120
And there is an incredible video

29:36.160 --> 29:37.920
by, you know, what's his name?

29:37.920 --> 29:41.040
Joe Skorborow with Misha.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.400
And they were hosting her father,

29:44.400 --> 29:48.160
Brazilian, he was the national security advisor.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.320
And Joe Skorborow said like, well, you know,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.600
like Arafat left the Oslo Accord and the Palestinians have,

29:53.600 --> 29:55.640
and then Brazilian said like,

29:55.640 --> 29:58.800
this is like embarrassingly shallow.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.720
It's like, listen, what happened was,

30:01.720 --> 30:04.880
there was a lot of catches on the Oslo Accord.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.480
It was very unfair to the Palestinians.

30:06.480 --> 30:08.000
So Arafat said like, I agree,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.480
but I need to take it to the Arab capitals.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.040
And they went to, and they went to Sharm el-Sheikh.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.080
They came to Egypt and he and Hew Barak went to there.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.400
And then Hew Barak left because there was election

30:19.400 --> 30:20.240
and he lost it.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.280
Israel came and it was destroyed.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.600
This is one of the reasons why people,

30:25.600 --> 30:30.080
it's kind of like facts don't matter as much

30:30.080 --> 30:32.160
as what is the narrative that has been controlled.

30:32.160 --> 30:35.040
But what were the biggest barriers to peace there?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.040
Do you think it's fundamentally leaders

30:37.040 --> 30:38.360
don't want a two-state solution

30:38.360 --> 30:42.800
or was there nuanced small differences

30:42.800 --> 30:46.040
that if solved could have led to a two-state solution?

30:46.040 --> 30:48.240
I mean, there was a, maybe there was a certain point

30:48.240 --> 30:53.240
when the Israeli leaders were more open to compromise,

30:54.440 --> 30:57.920
but I can say that because each time Israel gives back land,

30:57.920 --> 31:00.680
it has to be after some use of force.

31:00.680 --> 31:05.680
The 1973 war, the intifada, the first and second,

31:05.880 --> 31:09.560
the casualties in Gaza,

31:09.560 --> 31:13.200
they never give up land willingly and because of peace.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.680
Because if I have that much military,

31:14.680 --> 31:16.040
I can do whatever I want.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.440
Why would I give up anything?

31:18.440 --> 31:19.480
I have that much power.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.360
Why would America or China give everything

31:21.360 --> 31:23.200
if they're so powerful?

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
And especially if they have this kind of open check

31:25.200 --> 31:26.520
from the United States.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.680
So it is really about

31:30.600 --> 31:34.000
what can push Israel to give up something

31:34.000 --> 31:36.320
because you are so much stronger than me.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.560
What could compel you to give up something?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.440
And this is why the whole thing about like

31:42.440 --> 31:44.720
trying to equalize Palestinians

31:45.680 --> 31:47.440
and the Israeli state and government,

31:47.440 --> 31:49.560
it doesn't make any sense.

31:49.560 --> 31:53.000
So what is the source of hope?

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
John Stewart, who we'll talk about it from many angles,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.960
somebody you admire, a friend,

32:02.280 --> 32:03.960
he proposed a two-state solution.

32:05.080 --> 32:08.840
Look to the comedians for hope.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.320
Yes, well, everybody's talking about

32:10.320 --> 32:11.320
the two-state solution,

32:11.320 --> 32:14.680
but Israel has said many times on Netanyahu and Venezuela,

32:14.680 --> 32:17.360
like there's gonna be no state solution.

32:17.360 --> 32:20.040
They, in the past, it's like even Naftali Bennett,

32:20.040 --> 32:22.760
he came in on the hard talk.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.320
It's like, yeah, maybe in the past,

32:24.320 --> 32:25.160
we wanted two-state solutions,

32:25.160 --> 32:26.920
but like, look, every time we give them land, they kill us.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.080
So no state solutions.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.720
And they are openly saying it.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.680
But that's perhaps rhetoric.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.360
Rhetoric that is supported by action

32:35.240 --> 32:36.720
because look at what they're doing

32:36.720 --> 32:38.120
in the West Bank that you said.

32:38.120 --> 32:43.120
They are cutting it, illegal settlement, piecemealing it.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.680
So how, if you have an intention at all

32:45.680 --> 32:46.880
to give them anything,

32:46.880 --> 32:48.680
why would you keep doing this?

32:48.680 --> 32:51.680
And you've called it a bunch of little Gazas.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.520
It's a nice little picture of what's happening.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.080
Piecemealing it, dumb, dumb, dumb,

32:56.080 --> 33:00.600
because it is, what happened in the past four months,

33:00.600 --> 33:02.720
the Palestinians have been micro-dosing on it

33:02.720 --> 33:07.720
for a very long time, little by little, little by little.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.760
And we would shout every time when it gets too much,

33:11.760 --> 33:14.640
and then we shut down, and then little by little.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.720
But this time it was hard.

33:16.720 --> 33:21.480
It was hard to see the blatant oppression

33:21.520 --> 33:22.680
and the world said,

33:23.880 --> 33:25.480
maybe the Hamas Ministry of Health

33:25.480 --> 33:26.720
are giving us the bad numbers.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.280
Maybe it's just human shields.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.440
And I laugh, there's 13,000 babies killed.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.880
Does that mean that there are 13,000 military targets

33:35.880 --> 33:37.720
hiding in their diapers?

33:37.720 --> 33:40.800
Because it is so, it doesn't make any sense

33:40.800 --> 33:42.000
to kill that many babies.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.040
It's like, oh, oops, it is out of our hands.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.280
It's hard to know what to do with those numbers.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.240
I mean, it's just one baby is enough.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.920
But you know what happens?

33:52.920 --> 33:55.680
When you hear so many numbers, numbers become numbers.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.280
And you become so desensitized.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.760
And this is why there's a difference

34:00.760 --> 34:05.320
between saying 13,000 Palestinian kids did this,

34:05.320 --> 34:08.720
like Mila Cohen, an Israeli baby, 10-month-old.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.480
She was killed in her crib.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.040
And this is what we hear from CNN.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.000
We never hear a story about a Palestinian kid.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.480
That's why thank you for giving me the space

34:16.480 --> 34:18.960
for saying the names of the Palestinian children

34:18.960 --> 34:21.200
that were killed just for four weeks.

34:22.000 --> 34:26.040
It's because humans needs context.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.240
They need depth.

34:27.240 --> 34:31.160
They need like a 3D look at what they can look at.

34:31.160 --> 34:32.920
But if you just tell them numbers,

34:32.920 --> 34:34.440
oh, they don't mean anything.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.080
Is there some degree to where both leaderships,

34:37.080 --> 34:41.480
Hamas, PA, Palestinian Authority, Israel,

34:41.480 --> 34:46.480
all want war, like perpetual war to remain in power?

34:47.280 --> 34:49.320
That's an interesting question.

34:50.680 --> 34:53.040
But I mean, let's admit something.

34:53.040 --> 34:57.040
The Arab regimes in the area have actually used

34:57.040 --> 34:59.360
the problem of Palestine in order to stay in power,

34:59.360 --> 35:02.600
in order to take, get excuses, like have this enemy.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.800
And Israel, the Israeli government has used that too.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.320
And maybe the Palestinians.

35:07.320 --> 35:11.280
But my problem with when going into discussion,

35:11.280 --> 35:14.120
is that the two sides are not equal.

35:14.120 --> 35:14.960
They're not equal.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.160
The two sides are not equal.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.400
They're not equal in power.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.720
They're not equal in influence.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.880
And they're not equal in international support,

35:20.880 --> 35:22.560
especially with the United States.

35:23.400 --> 35:28.400
So Palestinians can, people who have made changes

35:28.880 --> 35:31.640
in history were the people with power.

35:31.640 --> 35:34.880
The people who would have the ability to change things.

35:34.880 --> 35:37.120
And the Palestinians cannot really change.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.200
And what can they change?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.200
Well, is that true though,

35:41.200 --> 35:46.200
with how much support the Palestinian people have.

35:46.200 --> 35:49.240
So just like you said, there's a lot of Arab states

35:49.240 --> 35:54.080
that are, that will voice their pro-Palestinian position

35:54.080 --> 35:57.120
in order to distract from their, the own corruption

35:57.120 --> 35:59.400
and abuses of power in their own countries.

35:59.400 --> 36:03.480
But, you know, I don't think if you look globally,

36:03.480 --> 36:06.600
there's a complete asymmetry of power

36:06.600 --> 36:07.920
and public opinion here.

36:07.920 --> 36:10.640
Maybe in the press in the West.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.040
But if you look globally.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.880
But do they have the same kind of weapons

36:13.880 --> 36:14.720
that the Israelis have?

36:14.720 --> 36:16.120
So literally power?

36:16.120 --> 36:20.240
No, there's a major asymmetry of literal power.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.720
Some money to their leaders.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.480
Does that make any difference?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.720
I mean, and also when you say Palestinian authority,

36:26.720 --> 36:27.920
which authority are you talking about?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.840
Hamas or the Palestinian authority

36:29.840 --> 36:31.760
who has been kind of a domesticated,

36:31.760 --> 36:34.600
kind of like a puppy for the Palestinians

36:34.600 --> 36:36.040
who basically have been an informant

36:36.040 --> 36:38.280
for their own people.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.520
And this is the thing also that kind of like

36:41.520 --> 36:43.600
really pissed me off when I was hearing the thing

36:43.600 --> 36:44.440
about these things.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.680
Like Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Hamas.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.120
Like we have Netanyahu on tape confessing

36:48.120 --> 36:49.560
that he supported Hamas, gave him money

36:49.560 --> 36:54.360
in order to cause factions in between the Palestinians.

36:54.360 --> 36:56.160
So it's just like, it doesn't make,

36:56.160 --> 36:57.760
you just told me this.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.600
You just told me this.

36:58.600 --> 36:59.440
You just told me Netanyahu supports Hamas.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.480
It's like, but Hamas is like, what?

37:01.480 --> 37:04.160
I mean, to which degree does Netanyahu represent

37:05.040 --> 37:08.720
the Israeli people, is a real question.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.080
To which point does Trump or Biden

37:11.080 --> 37:12.680
represent the American people?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.400
And to which degree does Hamas represent

37:14.400 --> 37:15.440
the Palestinian people?

37:15.440 --> 37:18.160
Does, none of these represent it,

37:18.160 --> 37:20.800
but who have the power in order to make the decisions?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.920
It really comes down to that.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.120
Well, who does have the power?

37:25.120 --> 37:27.960
Are you, you're giving a lot of power to Israel.

37:27.960 --> 37:28.800
Yeah.

37:28.800 --> 37:31.240
But the Arab league-

37:31.240 --> 37:32.320
What should Hamas do?

37:32.320 --> 37:33.760
What do you think we should Hamas do?

37:34.400 --> 37:36.520
I think we should continue doing what a charter says,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.600
which is trying to destroy Israel.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.680
And the role of the Palestinian people

37:40.680 --> 37:41.800
is to overthrow Hamas

37:41.800 --> 37:44.040
and get a more moderate leadership, probably.

37:44.040 --> 37:46.160
And the role of the Israeli people

37:46.160 --> 37:50.160
is to vote out this right-wing government

37:51.360 --> 37:53.800
and elect a more moderate leader

37:53.800 --> 37:56.080
so that there's a chance at peace

37:56.080 --> 37:57.720
with two moderate leaders.

37:57.720 --> 38:01.920
So before Hamas even got to control 2006,

38:01.960 --> 38:04.200
they had a real Charon in 2000.

38:04.200 --> 38:05.680
And we all know what happened.

38:05.680 --> 38:08.000
And a real Charon kind of like had made,

38:08.000 --> 38:09.680
came up with this amazing policy

38:09.680 --> 38:14.680
of like breaking people's kids' bones in the Intifada.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.760
So, Hill Baraki was also like,

38:17.760 --> 38:19.200
I mean, which one is moderate?

38:19.200 --> 38:22.960
I mean, I think Hamas is a product of what happened.

38:22.960 --> 38:27.960
I mean, we can, if there was no apartheid in South Africa,

38:27.960 --> 38:29.760
there would be no NFC.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.160
There would be no Nelson Mandela.

38:31.160 --> 38:33.080
If there were no Nazis in Paris,

38:33.080 --> 38:34.840
there would be no French resistance.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.840
And I'm not saying, and again, I'm not,

38:36.840 --> 38:39.640
I wouldn't don't wanna be put in a position

38:39.640 --> 38:40.960
to defend Hamas or anybody

38:40.960 --> 38:42.600
because you know what that entails.

38:42.600 --> 38:47.600
But there are, those are like Hamas,

38:48.960 --> 38:50.040
again, not defending them.

38:50.040 --> 38:53.120
They went into Kutubur, what was their,

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
why did they do that?

38:54.120 --> 38:57.400
Like release our hostages, the people in prison.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.520
Because if you talk about people who were kidnapped,

39:00.520 --> 39:03.520
Israel kidnaps people every single day.

39:03.520 --> 39:06.840
And when they had the first exchange in November 4th,

39:06.840 --> 39:08.480
Israelis, 400 people,

39:08.480 --> 39:10.520
three quarters of them were women and children.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.560
Why are those people in prison?

39:12.560 --> 39:15.360
There's one in four kids that are in prison

39:15.360 --> 39:17.360
that stay in solitary confinement,

39:17.360 --> 39:20.760
which is by international law, a form of torture.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.640
And you're putting kids through that.

39:22.640 --> 39:25.880
Is it possible, so first of all, ceasefire.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.720
Yes.

39:26.720 --> 39:30.120
And longer term, is it possible for Arab states

39:30.680 --> 39:33.600
and the United States to get together

39:33.600 --> 39:38.600
and with power through diplomacy, enforce a solution?

39:41.480 --> 39:44.680
It's a very, very ideal solution.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.400
But you know, and I know,

39:46.400 --> 39:49.200
that the Arab states don't really have the power.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.240
All of the powers are in the hands of America.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.240
They have the power.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.160
See, I would, I think they have the power.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.000
I don't.

39:55.000 --> 39:55.840
Maybe they don't wanna use it.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.800
They don't, well, that's.

39:57.800 --> 39:58.640
Maybe they don't.

39:58.640 --> 39:59.480
Because there's a benefit.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.720
Maybe there's a benefit.

40:00.720 --> 40:05.720
The dark sense I have is that a lot of people

40:06.680 --> 40:10.600
win from the suffering the Palestinians are going through

40:10.600 --> 40:12.960
because they can point to that

40:12.960 --> 40:16.480
and distract from corruption in their own states.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.880
And then obviously Iran can benefit also

40:18.880 --> 40:21.040
from the same kind of dynamic,

40:21.040 --> 40:26.040
distracting from the authoritarian nature of their regime.

40:26.120 --> 40:29.360
Definitely, but what is the core of the problem here?

40:29.360 --> 40:31.520
Is it the Arab states using the suffering

40:31.520 --> 40:34.800
or actually the suffering itself?

40:34.800 --> 40:37.840
And the suffering comes from people being displaced.

40:37.840 --> 40:39.520
Their homes were taken away.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.640
There are seven million Palestinians in diaspora.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.480
Seven millions.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.040
Seven million went out there

40:46.040 --> 40:48.560
and now they're living in Canada and America and Europe.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.400
They had homes there.

40:49.400 --> 40:54.800
They cannot go back to 1.7 million people of the people

40:55.640 --> 40:57.800
in Gaza don't belong in Gaza.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.920
They were pushed from other places.

40:59.920 --> 41:04.440
The piecemeal thing of people are being, you know,

41:05.920 --> 41:09.960
in Germany, I'm gonna shift gear a little bit.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.160
It's gonna be a little bit of fun.

41:11.160 --> 41:14.040
There is a book that I bought the rights to

41:14.040 --> 41:16.000
and I want to turn it into a movie.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.960
And I bought, I optioned the right for two months,

41:18.960 --> 41:22.720
for two years in March of last year before October 7th.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.120
After October 7th, I bought the permanent right.

41:26.120 --> 41:30.600
That book is called The Muslim and the Jew.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.160
And it is written by an author called Ronan Steinke.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.600
I read an article about this book in 2016

41:37.600 --> 41:41.160
and I chased that book for rights for seven years.

41:41.160 --> 41:44.760
I didn't have that much money, but I wanted that book.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.200
And that book was translated into English

41:47.200 --> 41:49.040
called Anna and Dr. Helmi.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.560
And that book tells the incredible story

41:51.560 --> 41:56.560
under Nazi Germany where Arabs went in droves to Berlin

41:57.880 --> 42:01.400
in 1920s after the First World War in the Weimar Republic.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.200
And they became doctors and engineers and journalists

42:05.200 --> 42:06.040
for two reasons.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.480
Number one, it's just they're cheap,

42:07.480 --> 42:09.120
very cheap because of the inflation.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.080
And two, a lot of the Arab nationalists

42:11.080 --> 42:16.040
didn't want to send their kids to England or France

42:16.040 --> 42:17.600
because they were the occupiers.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.240
And Dr. Helmi was the hero of that.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.720
He's an Egyptian doctor.

42:22.720 --> 42:25.840
And that's why I personally connected with him.

42:25.840 --> 42:29.920
And he went to medical school,

42:31.120 --> 42:32.400
didn't find a place to live,

42:32.400 --> 42:35.960
so he lived in the Jewish ghetto, like many Arabs.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.920
He didn't find a school to work at, a hospital to work in,

42:38.920 --> 42:40.600
so he worked in a Jewish hospital.

42:42.240 --> 42:45.240
So there was a lot of Arabs who lived with the ghetto.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.840
And actually, the first director of the Berlin Mosque

42:48.840 --> 42:52.040
was a Jewish convert who converted to Islam,

42:52.040 --> 42:53.280
and he was a gay activist.

42:54.400 --> 42:56.920
I'm telling you, this is like a crazy story.

42:56.920 --> 42:58.960
And this is not a fiction story.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.120
This is actually like a nonfiction.

43:00.120 --> 43:03.120
It's written actually based on the documents

43:03.120 --> 43:04.400
of the Nazis in Istanbul.

43:05.400 --> 43:09.680
Dr. Helmi, he was in this hospital,

43:09.680 --> 43:14.560
and the Nazis came in and they killed and tortured

43:14.560 --> 43:16.680
and beat up the Jewish doctor,

43:16.680 --> 43:19.320
and they made him the head of his department.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.240
Then now he is surrounded by a Nazi doctor.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.240
They didn't touch him because he was an Arab.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.160
There was kind of like a thing between Germany

43:26.160 --> 43:29.480
and the Arabs because they wanted to appease to them

43:29.480 --> 43:34.480
in order to have kind of a grassroot base

43:34.760 --> 43:37.320
in the Arab world where he want to go next.

43:38.160 --> 43:41.960
And this is why 1934, 1935,

43:41.960 --> 43:46.720
the racial laws of Nuremberg, they had a name change.

43:46.720 --> 43:48.960
First, they were called anti-Semitic.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.480
Then they changed into anti-Jewish

43:50.480 --> 43:52.760
because also Arabs were Semitic.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.360
So they wanted to appease the Arabs.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.400
Now, what happened to Dr. Helmi when that happened to him?

43:57.400 --> 43:59.000
He would go back to the ghetto

44:00.240 --> 44:03.600
and he would see the apartments next to him,

44:03.600 --> 44:07.760
the Jewish apartment, become more and more and more

44:07.760 --> 44:11.280
flooded with people because they were moving Jews

44:11.440 --> 44:14.320
and pushing them and putting them together,

44:14.320 --> 44:15.520
pushing them to the side.

44:15.520 --> 44:20.520
And each flat, each apartment, instead of one family,

44:20.920 --> 44:24.200
it would have three, four, six, seven families.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.360
And he was there when at home.

44:25.360 --> 44:29.160
And he looked, he was there.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.480
This is where the people he grew up with, he lived with.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.280
And now he's seeing that kind of discrimination

44:34.280 --> 44:35.560
just because he was an Arab.

44:35.560 --> 44:40.000
And then he started to kind of like atone

44:40.920 --> 44:42.240
for like, because he felt responsible

44:42.240 --> 44:43.720
because he wasn't treated the same way.

44:43.720 --> 44:47.080
And he started to go and treat Jewish people in their homes

44:47.080 --> 44:49.320
because they couldn't go to hospitals.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.800
And then one family gave them his daughter.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.200
It's like, this is Anna, save her.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.480
He took her, pretended that she is his niece,

44:58.480 --> 45:00.880
put a hijab around her, taught her Arabic,

45:00.880 --> 45:03.840
called her Nadia, my daughter's name, by the way.

45:03.840 --> 45:08.160
And he hid her in plain sight for seven years

45:08.160 --> 45:10.400
in front of the Nazis as his nurse.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.520
It's an incredible story.

45:11.520 --> 45:14.040
And then not just that he went to prison

45:14.040 --> 45:16.520
and then he went out and he formed with the Arab people

45:16.520 --> 45:19.560
that was in prison with him, a network that saves 300 Jews.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.080
See that kind of story?

45:23.040 --> 45:24.680
This is the Jews that were living in the Arab world.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.040
I'm not saying that the Jews living in the Arab world

45:26.040 --> 45:27.400
was living like an incredible life.

45:27.400 --> 45:28.880
Of course, as a kind of a minority,

45:28.880 --> 45:30.720
they did not have like the full power

45:30.720 --> 45:33.760
of the full advantages of the rule.

45:33.760 --> 45:34.640
That's normal.

45:34.640 --> 45:39.640
But we had this kind of a relationship

45:42.480 --> 45:47.480
before Israel was erected in 1948.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.080
And then, of course, everybody looked at Jews

45:51.080 --> 45:53.120
at the time as fifth column.

45:53.120 --> 45:55.720
And of course, the nationalistic regimes used that.

45:56.720 --> 46:01.640
And this is why what Biden said was very dangerous

46:01.640 --> 46:03.280
when he said, if there's no Israel,

46:03.280 --> 46:05.760
no Jew in the world will feel safe.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.440
You are the leader of the free world.

46:07.440 --> 46:08.920
You are the president of the United States.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.040
Do you mean that you're telling me that the Jews

46:11.040 --> 46:12.600
in your country, in the United States,

46:12.600 --> 46:13.800
for America are not safe?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.000
That is wrong on two levels.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.120
Number one, America, historically and right now,

46:18.120 --> 46:21.600
is more safe to Jews in the world than anybody.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.200
They are safer than the Jews in Israel.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.240
They never had pogroms or the Holocaust like Europe.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.360
They live here a good life.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.920
Not perfect life, but they are better.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.360
Second of all, if you're the president

46:30.360 --> 46:31.760
and you're telling that a group of people

46:31.760 --> 46:33.880
will not feel safe unless there's a different one,

46:33.880 --> 46:37.000
you are already feeding into their fifth column.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.200
They're like, you're Russian.

46:38.200 --> 46:39.400
You come from there.

46:39.400 --> 46:43.160
And there is a group of laws in the Russian constitution

46:43.160 --> 46:45.360
that says that Russia will protect its citizens

46:45.360 --> 46:46.600
everywhere in the world.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.240
What happens if the president says like,

46:48.240 --> 46:49.160
oh, you're Russians.

46:49.160 --> 46:50.240
You're protected by one country.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.080
You don't belong here.

46:51.080 --> 46:52.080
This is terrible.

46:52.080 --> 46:52.920
Yeah, you're right.

46:52.920 --> 46:54.680
That's actually an indirect threat.

46:54.680 --> 46:58.120
It's like, you know, even saying Muslims

46:58.120 --> 47:01.120
cannot feel safe in America or something like this.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.080
That means like that's a threat.

47:03.080 --> 47:06.440
But what would a Jewish person in Beverly Hills

47:06.440 --> 47:10.200
or in Brooklyn feel if he hears that?

47:10.200 --> 47:12.040
You are already telling people

47:12.040 --> 47:13.800
you need to be loyal to Israel.

47:14.680 --> 47:17.920
I mean, Israel is a foreign country.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.800
I am sorry, but Israel is a foreign country.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.440
Israel is a client country that we sponsor

47:23.440 --> 47:25.800
and it should actually be responsible

47:25.800 --> 47:28.280
and held accountable for what they do.

47:28.320 --> 47:31.280
You mentioned 1948, Anakba.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.280
But before that, 41, 39, 41 to 45, the Holocaust.

47:37.240 --> 47:38.080
What do you do?

47:38.080 --> 47:39.480
What do you do with the Holocaust?

47:39.480 --> 47:44.200
Like what, how do you incorporate into the calculus

47:44.200 --> 47:46.000
of what's...

47:46.000 --> 47:46.840
Oh, it's terrible.

47:46.840 --> 47:50.040
Of morality that leads up to the displacement

47:50.040 --> 47:55.040
of 700,000 Palestinians from the land.

47:55.520 --> 47:56.360
How do you work that out?

47:56.720 --> 47:59.280
It is terrible, but like, I mean,

47:59.280 --> 48:02.960
what the systemic annihilation of Jewish people

48:02.960 --> 48:07.960
under the Nazi, that is like a carefully engineered,

48:08.000 --> 48:09.440
thoughtful plan.

48:09.440 --> 48:10.280
It was terrible.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.160
It was like kind of like the human ingenuity

48:12.160 --> 48:14.760
put into like something that is very evil.

48:15.840 --> 48:18.680
But also it is not just that happened.

48:18.680 --> 48:20.880
We need to remember that Otto Frank,

48:20.880 --> 48:22.880
the father of Anna Frank has his visa,

48:22.880 --> 48:25.400
refugee visa rejected by the United States.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.000
There's a lot of people that were rejected

48:27.000 --> 48:29.920
by the United States, rejected by other European countries.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.840
And then they were pushed into Palestine.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.800
So you have to put yourself between like,

48:33.800 --> 48:36.560
and the Arabs, okay, we're sitting here, okay, come.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.520
And then, all right, you don't have a home

48:38.520 --> 48:39.960
or a country anymore.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.760
That, that, that, that, that kills you.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.120
I mean, you see, if I'm not an Arab

48:45.440 --> 48:47.040
and you give me that kind of piece

48:47.040 --> 48:48.600
of like terrible human trash,

48:48.600 --> 48:50.360
like, oh my God, that is terrible.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.520
But then I'm an Arab, like, yes, I'm so sorry,

48:52.520 --> 48:54.320
but what do I have to do with that?

48:54.560 --> 48:56.040
Why is that my fault?

48:57.280 --> 48:59.720
The persecution of the Jewish people have started

48:59.720 --> 49:01.680
since the eighth and ninth century,

49:01.680 --> 49:05.920
because they were like, they were first anti-Christians.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.640
They were like criminal immigrants.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.160
They were like conspirators.

49:10.160 --> 49:13.160
This is, this is, this is, this is the anti,

49:13.160 --> 49:16.640
like people kind of like, it's as if Europe

49:16.640 --> 49:18.920
kind of like throw anti-Semitism on us.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.280
You understand that like Henry Ford,

49:21.280 --> 49:23.120
Henry Ford is one of the biggest anti,

49:23.600 --> 49:26.560
he was the inspiration for Adolf Hitler.

49:26.560 --> 49:31.560
This is how anti-Semitic Henry Ford was.

49:32.960 --> 49:37.960
And you kind of like gloss over that.

49:38.400 --> 49:41.320
And then suddenly we as Arabs have to pay the price.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.160
Why?

49:44.120 --> 49:45.400
Several questions I want to ask there.

49:45.400 --> 49:47.280
So, but one just zooming out,

49:47.280 --> 49:51.880
why do you think hatred of Jews has been such a,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.560
viral kind of idea throughout human history?

49:55.560 --> 49:57.000
Oh, it's very easy.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.560
It all started from Christ.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.160
They killed Christ, they killed Christ, they killed Christ.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.200
They're the killer of Christ.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.200
That's a very sexy story.

50:03.200 --> 50:07.240
That was so, yeah, that was, and that stayed for years.

50:07.240 --> 50:10.120
That stayed for centuries, I'm sorry, centuries.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.320
They're the killer of Christ.

50:11.320 --> 50:16.320
And then the Catholic church did not allow usury,

50:16.880 --> 50:18.080
but they would work in usury.

50:18.080 --> 50:19.880
So they become rich.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.520
Now the people that we hate,

50:21.520 --> 50:24.640
that we accuse them of killing Christ are becoming rich.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.920
So that's envy now.

50:26.920 --> 50:29.120
And that's hatred.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.480
I mean, when you talk about ghettos,

50:32.480 --> 50:36.240
ghettos was not just as secluded parts in cities.

50:36.240 --> 50:39.960
Sometimes those ghettos were outside the cities.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.880
Jews were not even allowed to work a lot of professions.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.800
They were not allowed to get into the syndicates

50:45.800 --> 50:48.920
of certain professions.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.960
So they had to work in usury and they got rich.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.720
So the people hated them more.

50:52.720 --> 50:57.600
The first crusade didn't kill a single Muslim.

50:57.600 --> 50:59.480
All they killed were Jews.

50:59.480 --> 51:01.520
And when they finally arrived to Jerusalem,

51:01.520 --> 51:02.520
all they killed were Jews.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.640
They almost annihilated the Jews.

51:04.640 --> 51:06.080
So it was all this.

51:06.080 --> 51:07.720
And of course you have the dark ages.

51:07.720 --> 51:09.560
Who do you need as an enemy?

51:09.560 --> 51:11.960
The Jews, right?

51:11.960 --> 51:12.960
They're the killer of Christ.

51:12.960 --> 51:14.800
There's nothing bigger than this.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.040
And then you fast forward.

51:19.040 --> 51:21.280
I mean, one of the things that I found out

51:21.280 --> 51:24.200
that was very, very, very, very crazy

51:24.200 --> 51:28.840
when Henry Ford imported the protocols

51:28.840 --> 51:30.800
of the elders of Zion.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.160
By the way, in the Arab world,

51:32.160 --> 51:34.840
protocols of the elders of Zion is so popular

51:34.840 --> 51:37.840
and for obvious uses.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.480
And for the people who don't know it,

51:39.480 --> 51:41.720
it's kind of like a bunch of like stories.

51:41.720 --> 51:45.240
And basically it's like the Jews say,

51:45.240 --> 51:46.600
like, we've got to control the world

51:46.600 --> 51:48.080
and we're going to do this and we're going to do that

51:48.080 --> 51:49.120
and whatever.

51:49.120 --> 51:55.120
What people don't know that that is a work of plagiarism.

51:55.120 --> 51:59.120
It was plagiarized from a satirical play

51:59.120 --> 52:01.720
called Conversation in Hell

52:01.720 --> 52:05.000
between Machiavelli and Montesquieu.

52:05.000 --> 52:09.480
And it is kind of like based on one chapter,

52:09.560 --> 52:10.920
one scene or something.

52:10.920 --> 52:11.760
It's crazy.

52:11.760 --> 52:13.640
But it's crazy how sticky it is.

52:13.640 --> 52:14.480
Yes.

52:14.480 --> 52:15.320
That's weird.

52:15.320 --> 52:17.840
Yes, because if I hate you, that's great.

52:17.840 --> 52:20.040
But if I have a story to support that hate,

52:20.040 --> 52:20.880
that's even better.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.280
But it's like one of the best stories,

52:24.280 --> 52:26.320
one of the stickiest stories about hate.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.160
Of course.

52:27.160 --> 52:29.080
It's probably the most effective.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.400
It's like, there are, you know,

52:31.400 --> 52:34.600
a lot of peoples hate other groups of peoples,

52:34.600 --> 52:37.040
but that's just like the sexiest story of them all.

52:37.120 --> 52:42.120
Because humans need to concentrate their hate,

52:43.600 --> 52:46.840
their insecurities and their shortcomings

52:46.840 --> 52:50.520
into one thing that they can practice that hate on.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.960
If it's a person, great.

52:52.960 --> 52:55.200
If it's a group, even better.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.000
Right, how do you, into this calculus,

52:57.000 --> 52:59.680
incorporate that that group is pretty small?

52:59.680 --> 53:03.000
There's 16 million Jews worldwide.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.600
And you mentioned how is that the responsibility

53:07.160 --> 53:08.880
of the Arab peoples?

53:08.880 --> 53:10.280
You know, everybody should be to blame

53:10.280 --> 53:14.040
for not taking in Jews after the Holocaust.

53:14.040 --> 53:16.040
But, you know, the reality of the situation,

53:16.040 --> 53:18.880
if we look at the religious slice of this,

53:18.880 --> 53:22.840
there's 16, let's say, million Jews,

53:22.840 --> 53:24.680
and there's, I don't know how many Muslims,

53:24.680 --> 53:27.080
but 1.8 billion?

53:27.080 --> 53:28.560
Yeah, yeah.

53:28.560 --> 53:33.560
Do you, that difference, that 100X difference,

53:34.520 --> 53:38.760
do you incorporate that into the sense that Jews in Israel

53:38.760 --> 53:43.760
might feel for, you know, the existential dread

53:43.920 --> 53:47.640
that we might, this small group might be destroyed?

53:47.640 --> 53:50.160
Jews in Israel have every right to feel afraid

53:50.160 --> 53:51.760
because of everything that they see

53:51.760 --> 53:54.440
and everything they've been told, everything.

53:54.440 --> 53:58.000
But I would say that the calculus with the numbers

53:58.000 --> 54:02.360
doesn't, like, of course, like being small,

54:03.040 --> 54:06.600
it is, of course, a factor, but it is never an excuse

54:06.600 --> 54:08.840
in order to take something that's not yours.

54:08.840 --> 54:11.440
It's saying, like, hey, you have 300 million Americans

54:11.440 --> 54:14.160
and we have 52, 52 says, give one state for another,

54:14.160 --> 54:16.320
there's too many of them, too many of you,

54:16.320 --> 54:18.560
just give them something, you know?

54:18.560 --> 54:20.680
It's like the fact that I have something and you don't,

54:20.680 --> 54:21.960
and I have, there's too many of me

54:21.960 --> 54:25.320
and there is little of you, and then you come in

54:25.320 --> 54:29.480
and it's not really Israel against the Arab world

54:29.480 --> 54:32.200
or the Muslim world because we have to say,

54:32.240 --> 54:34.200
we fucked up big time.

54:34.200 --> 54:38.280
But it is the Palestinians that are in

54:38.280 --> 54:39.920
and they are being subjected to that.

54:39.920 --> 54:42.120
So it's not really like the 1.8 billion

54:42.120 --> 54:44.320
and the 16 million Jews.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.120
And the 1.8 billion, if you look at them,

54:46.120 --> 54:47.560
some of them, like, don't care,

54:47.560 --> 54:49.880
some of them live into regimes that are being oppressed

54:49.880 --> 54:52.240
and those regimes are supported by the United States

54:52.240 --> 54:56.440
in order, it's easier for me as an empire

54:56.440 --> 54:58.640
to take what I want from this country

54:58.640 --> 55:00.480
if I control the dictator.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.080
And I tell them that his power is linked

55:04.080 --> 55:08.040
to my ability, to my desire to keep him in power.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.000
So that's why you have a total disconnect

55:10.000 --> 55:13.440
between people in power in the Arab and the Muslim countries

55:13.440 --> 55:15.400
and the people themselves.

55:15.400 --> 55:18.680
Can you speak to the 1948, you know,

55:18.680 --> 55:21.280
because you mentioned taking land that's not yours,

55:23.280 --> 55:25.680
maybe parallels with Native Americans?

55:25.680 --> 55:27.200
Mm-hmm, yeah.

55:28.200 --> 55:29.400
There was a war.

55:30.520 --> 55:34.240
The Jewish minority fought that war

55:34.240 --> 55:37.480
against several Arab states and won that war.

55:38.960 --> 55:41.040
How do we incorporate that into the Catholic?

55:41.040 --> 55:44.200
Yeah, well, that's also a misconception,

55:44.200 --> 55:45.800
like a misinterpretation of the event

55:45.800 --> 55:50.800
because it seems that it was like the small,

55:51.200 --> 55:53.720
it's kind of like a David and Goliath kind of story.

55:54.680 --> 55:59.680
But, and I was always like, how did we not do that?

55:59.720 --> 56:04.720
But in reality, with numbers, I can't pull it up right now,

56:05.960 --> 56:08.000
but if you look at the numbers, the number of tanks,

56:08.000 --> 56:11.320
the planes, the trained officer,

56:11.320 --> 56:15.480
because many of those Jewish fighters came from World War II.

56:15.480 --> 56:17.200
They were seasoned fighters.

56:17.200 --> 56:22.200
And they actually had more planes, more tanks,

56:23.200 --> 56:25.120
more artillery, more pieces of weapon,

56:25.120 --> 56:26.600
more all of the other combined

56:26.600 --> 56:31.200
because the people that really like fought was Egypt.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.320
And you have to, 1948, many of those Arab countries

56:34.320 --> 56:35.440
didn't even have their independence,

56:35.440 --> 56:37.600
so they would kind of like send like a cavalry

56:37.600 --> 56:39.400
or like a people in horses.

56:39.400 --> 56:41.280
But in fact, the whole idea was like,

56:41.280 --> 56:44.240
we won against seven nations.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.320
The numbers were totally in Israel's favor.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.760
They were better equipped, they were better trained,

56:48.760 --> 56:51.880
they had like more tanks and artillery

56:52.840 --> 56:56.800
and airplanes, and they planned better.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.800
So yes, they deserved the win

56:58.800 --> 56:59.920
because they planned and we did it.

56:59.920 --> 57:02.120
So to you, there was an asymmetry of military power

57:02.120 --> 57:03.320
even then. Yeah.

57:03.320 --> 57:06.600
But what do you do with the fact that the war was won?

57:06.600 --> 57:09.000
So like, if you look at the history of the world,

57:11.000 --> 57:15.800
there is wars fought over land.

57:15.800 --> 57:16.640
I agree with you.

57:16.640 --> 57:18.440
This has been the history of humanity.

57:18.440 --> 57:20.280
Humanity was not living peacefully.

57:20.280 --> 57:22.040
It's all about like people taking people

57:22.040 --> 57:23.800
and equally people taking their land.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.880
But there's two difference here.

57:25.880 --> 57:30.880
Mostly, usually, the conquering power,

57:31.600 --> 57:33.040
like for example, England.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.440
They had England and they conquered you in India.

57:35.440 --> 57:38.000
And after the occupation finished, they go back to England.

57:39.320 --> 57:43.160
France, Greece, Persia, Egypt,

57:43.160 --> 57:45.160
they were like, go in, expand, and it's shrink,

57:45.160 --> 57:46.200
expand and shrink.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.600
It's all been there.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.840
What is different here is exactly what happened

57:49.840 --> 57:52.080
in Australia and the United States.

57:52.080 --> 57:54.120
A group of people came in,

57:54.120 --> 57:56.560
not just to conquer and take the land,

57:56.560 --> 57:58.400
but to completely change that,

57:58.400 --> 58:00.520
to replace them and get them out or kill them.

58:00.520 --> 58:01.840
It was very easy with the Indians

58:01.840 --> 58:03.120
because they had smallpox.

58:03.120 --> 58:04.240
There was no social media.

58:04.240 --> 58:06.240
They did it over 400 years.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.400
They had time.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.160
The problem is what is happening right now.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.000
I agree with you.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.240
It might not be that new,

58:13.240 --> 58:16.440
but we are there and we're watching it happen.

58:16.440 --> 58:19.480
And so now we have to confront the realities of war

58:19.480 --> 58:22.240
and empire and conquering.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.440
Because you know what's the problem?

58:23.440 --> 58:25.200
We told ourself we can be better.

58:26.440 --> 58:29.520
After 1948, there was the Universal Declaration

58:29.520 --> 58:31.200
of Human Rights.

58:31.200 --> 58:33.520
It means that we are gonna be better humans.

58:33.520 --> 58:35.400
We're not gonna kill and take land.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.560
We're not gonna displace people.

58:36.560 --> 58:38.400
We're not gonna take people for what they are.

58:38.400 --> 58:39.400
There's now laws.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.400
There's international laws.

58:40.400 --> 58:42.640
There's International Court of Justice.

58:42.640 --> 58:44.960
And now Israel is giving the middle finger to all of them.

58:44.960 --> 58:46.560
So isn't in some fundamental way,

58:46.560 --> 58:49.320
this whole thing that we're talking about

58:49.320 --> 58:52.640
is us as a civilization on social media,

58:52.640 --> 58:57.640
in articles and books and in newspapers,

58:58.120 --> 59:01.560
we're just trying to figure out who are we as a people.

59:01.560 --> 59:04.120
I think the shock came from the fact

59:04.120 --> 59:07.760
that we thought that we as humanity have evolved

59:07.760 --> 59:09.240
and now we are,

59:10.400 --> 59:13.480
what have actually changed is that we became more advanced

59:13.480 --> 59:16.000
in effectively eradicating a group of people

59:16.000 --> 59:18.040
because of the technology that we have.

59:18.040 --> 59:20.960
And the fact that we can do that under the eyes and ears

59:20.960 --> 59:23.680
of all the world and we are watching it under a phone.

59:23.680 --> 59:24.720
We have a window.

59:24.720 --> 59:26.600
We have a window to the war.

59:26.600 --> 59:30.000
1945, people didn't know what was happening in Japan.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.160
We heard about it in the radio.

59:32.160 --> 59:35.240
Like, oh, today our forces came in and they launched.

59:35.240 --> 59:36.080
We don't know.

59:36.080 --> 59:37.320
We heard it.

59:37.320 --> 59:40.120
Maybe we saw pictures after that and it's quite edited.

59:40.120 --> 59:41.520
But now we see it.

59:41.520 --> 59:42.640
We're into it.

59:42.680 --> 59:47.680
And it is so much for our psyche and we can't get it.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.880
And it's like, and the Arabs are saying like,

59:49.880 --> 59:53.360
guys, you told us we came to the West

59:53.360 --> 59:54.880
because we were told that we were equal.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.960
You know the university declaration, right?

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.360
One of the co-authors, his name is Stefan Hessel.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.200
He's a Jew.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.600
He is a survivor of the Holocaust.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:08.280
And you know what happened to him?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.640
He died, by the way, a couple of years ago,

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.720
but he, before he died, he was canceled by so many people

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.000
and he was called anti-Semitic

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.680
because he joined the BDS movement

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.560
and he spoke of Tuf Palestine.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.640
That is the author of the universal declaration

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.040
of human rights that we value so much.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.800
And we think that that would define our humanity.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.200
But then we go in and we are shocked.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.800
It's like, maybe we were sold something.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.360
Maybe that was false advertisement.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.080
You shared a tweet by an account called Awesome Jew.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.760
It reads, Islamo-Nazi comedian, Bassem Youssef,

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.600
comedian in clothes, by the way.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, because I'm not funny.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.920
So Islamo-Nazi comedian Bassem Youssef

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.640
is now denying the October,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.080
I love that you retweeted this like twice.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.040
I guess suppose because it's advertising

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.320
some upcoming dates.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.720
He's now denying October 7th massacre.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.000
The Muslim radical Bassem Youssef is notorious

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
for his radical, radical set twice,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.360
for his radical hatred of Jews in Israel.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.920
In a recent clip, he claims that the atrocities

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.240
committed on October 7th are fabricated

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.240
or are looking for all information

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:28.440
regarding any of his upcoming shows,

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.640
as well as the venues which host the scumbag

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.840
where Jews feel safe around this Nazi, Nazi.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.960
Yeah.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.240
I've never, this is my first time interviewing a Nazi.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:41.920
No, it's the first time I actually get called a Nazi.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.760
First time.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.760
First time, I have been called so many things in Egypt.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:50.760
So in Egypt, I was called a CIA operative,

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.480
a Mossad spy, a secret Muslim brother

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.280
who is a secret Jew, a secret Jew.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.120
There was also an article that was published about me

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.080
in the state-run media saying in details

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:10.080
how Bassem has been recruited by CIA agents

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.560
using John Stewart in order to use satire

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.080
to bring down the country.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.960
I was a Freemason, an infidel,

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.960
a member of the Knights of the Temple, something like that.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.240
And there's actually people, the Muslim Brotherhood

01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.520
on their show, they would say like,

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.240
he is actually an Israeli and they have forged

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.400
an Egyptian ID for him to come here.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.560
So it's kind of like when I get, I said,

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.080
I had, I left all of that behind and I come here,

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.880
it's like, boom, anti-Semitic Nazi, damn.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.280
I mean, I really covered everything.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:44.360
I don't know what else.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.920
I mean, I think I, it's kind of like I'm collecting PhDs.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.000
I'm just like getting like all of these credits.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:51.840
How do you deal with that?

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.440
How do you deal with the attacks?

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.120
I mean, this goes back to the decision

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.640
to do the interview with Piers Morgan.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.480
Like how do you like psychologically do all of it?

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.720
These kind of attacks, at the beginning, it's fun.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.160
But when they evolve into something else,

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.280
so for example, I was like laughing of all of the stuff

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.920
about calling me this, calling me that.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:16.760
But then when people would come and thread the theater,

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.200
because it's not the people who are making those accusations

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200
that would come to you, it's the people that will hear

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.040
and see those accusations and act on it.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.040
And there's always the fear of like,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.200
I mean, we have in the air board a lot of things

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.600
that somebody would hear something about someone else

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.800
and go kill him and whatever, like anybody else.

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.720
So there's this, but somehow I wanna make fun of it.

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.840
And it is to be called an Islamo-Nazi,

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.960
it must been the funniest thing ever.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.120
Because does it, Islamo-Nazi, wow, how did you,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.680
and a radical Muslim, me, a lot of Islamists hate me.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.880
They will call me a secular infidel.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.040
So it's kind of like, who am I?

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.000
Maybe I have an identity crisis

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
and I need the people to tell me who I am.

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:09.320
Well, let's go to the beginning.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.520
Let's go to your childhood.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.480
You grew up in Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.960
Oh, my childhood.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.600
Well, let's figure out how you came to be who you are.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.400
How did you become an Islamo-Nazi?

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.760
Yeah, exactly, it's a long journey.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.280
I do like the swastika tattoo on your ass,

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.400
which I didn't.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.000
How did you see my ass?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:28.840
You know what you did.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.680
I know what you did.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:31.520
It was very inappropriate.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.440
You're also, obviously, a sexual harasser of me.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:37.760
Is this like a me too?

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:38.600
Yes.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.440
Is this like 2020?

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.000
Someone will come up, it's like, okay, we flip it.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.440
This is your me too moment.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.080
All right, so Cairo, what's a defining memory,

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.920
positive or negative from your childhood?

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.000
My memory, in general, was cool.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.840
It was cool.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.840
I went to a Catholic school for primary school, elementary.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.080
And by the time I'd done,

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.360
there was kind of like a start of a decline

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.680
into the public education.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.120
And my parents, they're like middle-class working officials.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:16.960
My dad was a judge.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.680
My mom was a business professor.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.600
And they were like, one of the people was like,

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.280
they didn't have that much luxury.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.200
My dad drove like a regular car, a Fiat,

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:31.200
which is like the equivalent for the Lada in Russia.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.920
Thank you for speaking to the audience.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.480
Yeah, yeah, the Lada.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.400
So would that be a good car?

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.680
No, no, it's kind of like the minimum.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:45.360
My dad was not like a man of showing off.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.080
Whatever money they would do,

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.440
they would put it for us, education,

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.600
give everything to their kids.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:55.600
This is kind of like a very, very typical mentality.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:58.760
And I'm sure it's in many cultures,

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.920
but like we grew up with this.

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:01.600
Like everything that we have is left for kids.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.880
So they will put us into education.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.960
So middle school, that was the big,

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.360
1986 was the beginning of the explosion

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.800
of like international schools, private schools.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.000
And these schools were relatively expensive.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.280
Of course, now with today's currency, it's ridiculous,

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.640
but at that time it's very expensive.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.520
So I went to that school and from,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.480
there was this moment was like, you feel less right away.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.440
I mean, of course there's the regular bullying and stuff,

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:34.080
but it's not that it's kind of like, you always feel less.

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.280
You don't have that much of like purchasing power

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.160
that can allow you to go to the same outings

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.080
or travel with them.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.040
And even like how you dress,

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:43.160
it would be modest compared to them.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.160
So I was always an outsider.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.480
I was, and I compensated with that by two things,

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.040
being good at school and being good at sports.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.000
So I was not like the typical nerd who was just like that.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.840
I was like, I was playing football, basketball,

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.680
cratering field.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.000
And I was like, one of the people would like to have me

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:01.840
on their team.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.280
So I wasn't like, kind of like, ah, he's a nerd,

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.120
get him away.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120
But I never had a girlfriend.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.680
I never had any kind of like,

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.680
it was not like I was not boyfriend material.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.040
So that's kind of like, it leaves remnants in you

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.280
that you're not good enough.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.200
But psychologically, you're always like,

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.600
when you're by yourself, you felt like an outsider.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.400
Yes, all the time.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.600
And that's why it kind of like, I'm more of a loner.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600
I don't have a lot of what you call friends.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.600
I have acquaintances, people that I do stuff with,

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.920
but I don't have like the people that I tell them everything.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920
When I went to medical school,

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.320
now medical school is a different animal.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.360
Medical school is where all of the people

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.120
from the public schools go.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.880
Public schools are very like, they are not,

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.200
they don't have like, they don't have English language

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.000
as like a strong partner, but they are brilliant people.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.840
So because they would mostly study in Arabic,

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:50.240
but they are brilliant.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.880
And they are very, very, very smart, very sharp.

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.720
But then I'll go there.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.200
Now I am the sissy boy from the private school

01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.840
that comes into medical school.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:01.880
Now I'm an outsider again.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:06.880
And I go into residency and I pick up salsa.

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.760
So now I'm a salsa teacher

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:13.280
while being a cardiothoracic surgery resident.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.040
And I'm an outsider for the third time,

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.160
because in salsa, I'm kind of like the respectful doctor.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.080
And in resident, I'm the guy who is just dancing.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.320
So, and everything, of course,

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:24.960
as a medical resident, you will mess up a lot.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.160
So they would always like, oh, because you're a dancer,

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.480
oh, because you don't care about medicine.

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.760
You just like want to go there and dance with women.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.600
Which is true.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.120
Which is true.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.720
And so all of my life, I felt that I'm an outsider.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.760
I'm not part of the team.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.360
I'm not part of the core group.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.080
So, and I have a story that you would love.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.120
Right before my residency, I was so much into salsa.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.880
So I had all of the money and then you saved that.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.840
And I was working in summers and I was doing extra jobs.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.480
And I took that money and I went to Miami

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:07.000
in order to learn Rueda de Casino,

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.720
which is the Cuban kind of like circle salsa kind of thing.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.280
And I went there in the summer of 2001.

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.280
And my return ticket was 9-12, 2001.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.360
The universe is a sense of humor, I gotta tell you that.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:28.360
No, no, no, 9-12, I was supposed to be on a plane

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.200
coming back to Egypt.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.080
What happens?

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.240
Thank God, I ran out of money 10 days before that.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:36.840
Just like, all right, I changed my ticket and I came back.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.840
9-11, I'm kind of like, my mom, wake up, wake up, what, what?

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.280
It's like, and I see like the two tower four

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:48.360
and it was like, my mom's like, oh, you're here,

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.800
you're here, you're here, it's like, oh, you're here.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.200
And I was like, I could have been in Guantanamo right now.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.440
Yeah, flying at 9-12.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.800
But by the way, I was in Miami.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.920
When they went to the flying school in Miami.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:07.920
So, I mean, I had like 9-11 written all over my face.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.720
You'd be all over the news.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.560
All over the news.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.880
And my mom was like, what?

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:13.080
He went there to dance salsa?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.880
I didn't know that salsa is like a name for terrorists.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.280
Why salsa?

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.040
Why did that attract you?

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.760
And what, like, can you explain what salsa is?

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.360
So I mentioned to you offline

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.160
that I've been doing a little bit of tango,

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.000
trying to learn it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.400
Yeah, like, you know, samba, salsa, pachata, meringue,

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.240
it's kind of like Latin dances.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:34.520
And it's like, you know,

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.200
I don't know how you describe salsa,

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.560
couple dance on Latin beat.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:43.560
And I did it because I once,

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.640
and I talk about that in my Arabic stand-up comedy,

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.480
not the English.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.440
I talk about like how I was, you know,

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.320
I didn't have like really like a great like social life.

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:57.200
And my friends went there one day

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.520
and I go into a place which it was called El Ghetto Negro.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.280
No, no, it was called Big Fat Black Pussycat.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:09.040
And then I think they thought it will be like racist

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.280
or something to switch it to El Ghetto Negro.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.120
Anyway, so.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.560
Great, great.

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.680
I know. Great decision.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.520
I know.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.960
So I went there, it's like, damn, music and women.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880
And my doctor, a doctor dancing salsa,

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.120
that is a chick magnet.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.080
Yeah, 100%.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.160
You know, we do everything for that.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.000
All of you.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.600
Even power, even money.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.560
All the wars we've been talking about.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.040
Women.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:37.880
At the end of the day.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.440
The approval from the other sex.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.120
We are babies, we are terrible people.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.560
So of course, like, I mean, that was like great.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.840
But then I, as a nerd, I went in so hard

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.640
and now I became a salsa teacher.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.640
Yeah.

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:57.400
And I earned more money from salsa

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.600
more than I did as a doctor.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.280
I didn't know this part of you.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.120
That's hilarious.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:06.640
I know, I was making, I was making killing amount of money.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.800
Like huge amount of money.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.040
And I was just like, you know, I'll go finish my shift

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.360
and I go to the salsa class.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.080
And sometimes I would have like 70 people

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.080
in my salsa class.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:16.920
Oh wow.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.600
I had like the biggest salsa class in Egypt.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.960
In the beginning of 2000.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.320
And it was fantastic.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.600
And it was an outlet because you go there

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.520
and there's the shifts.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.240
And people dying.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:28.080
Damn.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:28.920
And they go salsa.

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:29.760
Can I escape?

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.880
You must've been good.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.760
I was okay.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:33.600
I was cool.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.440
I was fun.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.280
There were people better than me,

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.960
but I have a thing about teaching.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:39.120
I like teaching people.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:41.240
So you mentioned heart surgery.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:43.720
So what motivated you to become a doctor?

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:46.280
It was a choice of exclusion.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.640
I mean, there's nothing else you can do

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.600
with these high grades other than doctor and engineering.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.200
I hate math, so go be a doctor.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.280
This is the Middle East.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.120
What do you expect?

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.680
It's either, like in my joke, in my show,

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.000
I said like there's, it can be one of three things

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.840
in the Middle East.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.800
A doctor, an engineer, or a disappointment.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.280
It is, that is the choices that you have.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.760
So years after, I'm a disappointment.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.640
You're damn good at it though.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.760
That's a hard path though.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.600
Yeah.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.040
And it's a fascinating one.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:22.880
Can I tell you something?

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.720
Yes.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.560
That actually I was thinking about

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.240
why did I actually go into medicine?

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.400
And why did I always choose the hardest thing

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.640
although I didn't love it?

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.640
And I have to tell you, I had an epiphany

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.800
only two weeks ago.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.600
And I don't know if that's actually related or not.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:40.520
You know, remember when I told you I went to this school

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.520
and I didn't have that much money,

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.560
and I didn't have the luxury of time or money

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.440
to be with those people and do what they do.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.880
So by the time I finished school,

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:52.240
and everybody was going to university,

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.680
oh, everybody in my school went to the AUC,

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.280
the American University in Cairo course, probably.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:02.520
Like American education, party time.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.480
Like, I mean, of course they're brilliant and everything,

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.600
but they have, yeah, they have a different, you know,

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.040
social life.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.880
And part of me, now I kind of like,

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.960
I realized that just like very, very recently.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:20.920
Maybe I went to the hardest school ever,

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:25.920
so I don't have space to use other than studying.

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.040
Because if I have that much space,

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.440
what am I gonna do with it?

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.360
I don't have that much freedom, I don't have that much money.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.480
I can compete with those people going out,

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:36.840
so maybe I need a solid excuse

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.080
that I'm in a place where I don't have

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.440
that much of a spare time.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.920
Is it also possible, I like how this is a therapy session

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.400
where we're psychoanalyzing.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.360
Is it also possible that you always just pick the hardest

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.760
thing you could possibly do?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.200
Maybe, but.

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.400
Maybe that's the Piers Morgan thing too.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.520
Like what?

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.920
Maybe, but like when I left Egypt and I came here,

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.360
I still had the choice to go back to medicine.

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:01.200
Sure.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.440
But I hated it, I hated it.

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:04.400
Medicine traumatized me.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400
The amount of like, you give up,

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.320
you know my brother in Egypt, he had a daughter,

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.800
she's a brilliant basketball player.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.840
She is in the national team, amazing.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.280
I used to play basketball also in the Egyptian league,

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.640
but I never, I was kind of like,

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.640
my favorite position in the court was the bench.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.080
And I was not as good as her, but she,

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:30.080
and then he, it was time for her to go into college.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.840
And he didn't talk to me for six weeks.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:35.520
I said, Temer, what's happening to Farida?

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.360
Which college?

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.080
Like I didn't want to tell you, she went into medicine.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:38.920
I said, what?

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.120
Medicine, why did he do?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.680
Because he knows how I hated it.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.520
I was traumatized.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.200
And I said like, dude, she's a basketball player.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.600
Make her go like to an easy school.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.240
So that's kind of, it's fine.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.720
You still did it, you still did it.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.120
I still did it, but I don't know,

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.200
is it because of the difficulty

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:58.160
or because of what I told you?

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.880
Maybe I needed something,

01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.000
maybe because I was not very confident in my social life.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.960
So I needed a distraction not to be,

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.920
to have that much of a social life.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.200
Oh wow, okay.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:10.040
You understand?

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:10.880
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:11.720
So it's kind of loud

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.240
because I will always have an excuse I'm studying.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.760
I have something, I have exams.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:15.600
And I don't know,

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.560
I kind of like self-sabotage my own thing

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.160
because I couldn't compete with those people

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.080
on the outing and the money and whatever.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.080
So I need an excuse to be like, oh, he's a doctor,

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:26.920
he's studying.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.800
At least in your own mind, you couldn't compete.

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.800
I always felt as less because, I mean,

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.240
I didn't have any girlfriends in school.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.480
I had very little life.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.840
Everything to me came to life.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.320
So I always felt, even stand-up comedy,

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:43.680
it came very late to me in life.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.120
So I always feel that I'm not good enough.

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.960
I feel that I didn't spend the time

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:51.880
to build the foundation that other comedians do.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:55.200
So I always feel that I am too lucky.

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.040
I always feel that this is a fleeting thing.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.760
And when I went had the height and the fall in Egypt,

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.120
when I was like the top of everything,

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120
I was like so famous.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:09.480
And then everything was taken away from me.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.040
That's like, ah, you see, I told you.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.520
That happens when you don't build foundation, you fall.

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:18.560
So I always feel that I am not good enough.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:21.440
Or if I am in a position where people think I am,

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.680
deep inside, I am not.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.040
You know that I have a speech impediment

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.040
that I was not meant to be a TV presenter.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.360
I have an air, in Arabic, it's very obvious.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.720
I cannot roll my R's.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:35.640
I cannot say er, I cannot roll it.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.040
So in Arabic, like Spanish, it's very obvious.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.960
So when I did my first video on the internet,

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:41.800
that made me famous,

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.080
and then I got my television deal back there in Egypt,

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.000
my partner at the time, he took the video

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.680
and he went to a producer and said like,

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.600
are you giving me a guy with a lisp?

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.800
He couldn't, he should, that's why when I came on television,

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.600
I was the first ever guy with a lisp.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.000
I had two things going for me, the lisp and the big nose.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.280
And I was always bullied for these two all the time,

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.240
so I always felt less.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.600
See, but that's the foundation of like,

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.240
creating a great person.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.640
Yeah.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.840
Because if you're pretty,

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.120
you don't need to do much.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:18.640
I probably wouldn't recommend it, but it is true.

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:23.440
So if you are pretty, do some disfigurement in your race.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.440
Find the flaws and be extremely self-critical about them.

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.880
So you saw Jon Stewart on TV for the first time in 2003,

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.840
how did that change your life?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.880
I was in a gym and I was running on the treadmill.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:45.280
And at that time, CNN was coming out on cable.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:51.560
And I was watching and there's this studio,

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.920
I don't know what it is, so I put the earphones on

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.360
and I started watching.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.400
And I was so taken by this that I stopped the treadmill

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.880
and I just stood for the 20 minutes like this

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:05.960
on the treadmill.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.720
And I just like standing there.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.240
I didn't know what he was saying.

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.600
I didn't understand what is Democrats,

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.920
what is Republicans, those names that he's saying,

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.240
what is Fox News, I don't understand.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.280
But I was fascinated.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.280
There was something, you know,

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:21.520
when you don't understand the music,

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.960
but you get the rhythm, it was that.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.040
I wonder what that is that you saw.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.600
It's like the timing of the humor.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.080
I mean, there is, Jon Stewart is one of a kind.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:35.080
Like his biting criticism of power,

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.720
I would say, and also ability to highlight

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:38.960
the absurdity of it all.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.520
But you understand I didn't understand any of that.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.880
But I didn't understand any of the references.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.240
But it is the rhythm.

01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:48.560
The rhythm, you know, sometimes when you even see

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:52.120
like a comedy, that's a language you don't understand,

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:52.960
but there's a rhythm.

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.480
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta, boom boom.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.120
There's something, there's something in the music.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:00.960
So there's something with the videos and the pictures

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.320
and he and the face and people reacting.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.240
Yeah.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:05.080
What is this?

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:05.920
What is this?

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.760
Yeah.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.600
What is this?

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.760
And we had the global edition.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.720
So I went to the YouTube and I just like started

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.760
to kind of like watch every single episode that I can.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.120
I said, like, do you think we can have this in Egypt?

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.880
I said, nah, never.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:23.480
And then 2011, like I had a friend of mine

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.880
who was also a YouTube partner.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:26.080
It was something new at the time.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.400
He said, like, let's do something on the internet.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.240
Let's do something.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240
I said, I want to do Jon Stewart.

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:31.680
It's like, do Ray William Johnson.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.720
Jon Stewart will not work.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.320
I want to do Jon Stewart.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.200
So that was in there.

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.480
Yeah, it was in there.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:42.240
And I did it and it worked.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.320
Can you talk about 2011?

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:44.920
I mean, what is it?

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.320
The Arab Spring, what is it?

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.440
People here in America, you know.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.400
It depends on which side.

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.720
Did something happen or what?

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:58.640
It depends which side of the equation you are.

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.440
Because for a lot of people, it's a conspiracy.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.640
It's American made.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.000
It is the Muslim Brotherhood.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.040
It's the Islamists.

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.160
It is Israel.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.080
It is everything else other than people.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.360
Oh, but it's a pure revolution.

01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.200
It's a pure.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:15.120
I think we put too much weight on conspiracies.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:18.160
I think it is normal human behavior

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:21.440
that then become, get maybe used or abused

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.480
or taken advantage of by other powers.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.560
And then the conspiracy starts.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:30.280
But at the time, the Arab Spring didn't start in Egypt.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.240
It started in Tunisia.

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.640
Boaziz, a fruit vendor, like burned himself up,

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:40.480
like the American soldiers who did that a few days ago.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:44.320
And that kind of sparked protests in Tunisia.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:47.040
And Ben Ali was a dictator in Tunisia

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:50.800
for about like 20 years and they removed him.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.680
So suddenly it was kind of like a domino effect.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:57.640
So then Egypt started and it just took 18 days.

01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.080
And people, hindsight is 20, 20.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.680
Same side, like Mubarak became like a burden on the military

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.840
because the military are the real rulers of the country.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.520
You might have a president that kind of like

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.560
have certain powers, but at the end of the day,

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.760
when the military sees that a certain president

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:16.160
is like too much of a burden, too much of like a,

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:17.320
so like they cut him off.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.400
And Mubarak is the leader of Egypt at the time.

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.640
He was there for 30 years.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:21.480
30 years.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:22.520
By the way, speaking of which,

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.960
because it was a joke in your Mark Twain speech.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:27.400
I got teary-eyed just watching that.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:30.520
You're like fucking great,

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.920
like what you did when Mark Twain awards for John Stewart.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.760
It's great.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.960
I mean, your comedy is great in general.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.400
And I wanted to go to your show.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.280
I definitely will.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.360
But that's like a little stroll on the complete tangent

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:44.040
of just the masterful introduction

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.760
and celebration of John Stewart.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.000
Anyway, Mubarak.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.640
Yeah, so it's a joke that I say also,

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.800
like Mubarak was a president for 30 years.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.320
Like, oh my God, you had a president for 30 years?

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.600
Like it's the Middle East, it's a very short first term.

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.400
It's like we're still warming up, baby.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.240
Just warming up.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.800
And I thought like, we need to plan ahead.

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:05.000
We need to plan our vacations, our careers, our jail time.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.200
It's just like we need to.

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.200
That's great.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.600
So, true.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.040
So we had kind of like the shortest, nicest revolution.

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.080
18 days.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.200
And we thought, oh, 18 days.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.000
We can change the country in 18 days.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.680
But of course we were naive and we had this kind of hope.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.160
So Mubarak was removed.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.080
There was an interim period by the military.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:25.920
Took it for one year.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:26.880
And then they did elections.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.480
Muslim Brotherhood came to power.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.640
They stayed for one year.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.720
And then the military removed them.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:38.520
And in these three years, my show started.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:41.760
It started by kind of like a YouTube video.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.360
It became famous overnight.

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.640
Overnight.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.960
Five to six videos, boom, went out.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.000
And at that time I was waiting

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.480
to get my clearance to go to Cleveland.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.960
I was accepted in a fellowship

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:58.560
as a pediatric heart surgery in a hospital in Cleveland.

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:01.360
And I said, all right, I'm just gonna do a couple of videos.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:02.760
Maybe I'm gonna put in an internet.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:04.080
And maybe after a year or two,

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:05.200
after I come back from the fellowship,

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.880
somebody will come, hey, why don't you write a show

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.160
that looks like John Stewart?

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.520
That was my main.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.640
Took five weeks.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.040
I had my first contract of television.

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:16.840
And overnight, the exposure.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.760
And over the next two, three years,

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:22.440
I had 30 to 40 million people watching

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.120
every episode.

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.400
A lot of this like, wow, that's too much.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.520
That is terrifying.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.440
Because it means that there are 30 million people

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.000
who have an opinion about you.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:36.520
You said there's a lot of aspects of that sudden fame

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:37.520
that were just horrible.

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:38.720
It's toxic, it's toxic.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:40.800
It's unnatural, it's unnatural.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.880
When people started to recognize me in the street

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.200
and take pictures, I was awkward.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.400
It's like, why do you wanna have a picture with me?

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.320
Why, why is it?

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.240
Because I didn't feel that I'm worthy enough

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.600
to be like a reward for someone to have a picture.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:53.480
And I didn't understand it.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:55.760
I was actually, I was kind of an ass sometimes

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.440
because people thought it was arrogance.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.760
No, it was confusion.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.360
And I remember like my director and my producers

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:07.360
and people around, they always saw me in a very bad mood.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.000
It's like, why are you not enjoying this?

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.960
It's like, because this is not natural.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.520
This is not natural.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:16.720
This adoration, this love, and this have to end somehow.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:17.560
And it did.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.480
And in, because at a certain point, you are human.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.400
And people, kind of the adoration and the fun

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.040
and the love comes because they see you saying stuff

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.920
because you do your job, basically.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.360
Political satire is basically us making fun

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.880
of politicians in the media.

01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.480
And a lot of people have a really strong opinions

01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.680
about politicians in the media.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.000
So we came that, we articulate that,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.800
and we give it to them and we make them laugh.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.840
So for them, we made a great job.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.360
So why don't you do more?

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:50.440
But you are limited.

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.400
And at a certain time, you can't.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.920
And at a certain time, you're afraid because we're humans.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.000
Because you're afraid about like,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.440
if I continue speaking up,

01:25:58.440 --> 01:25:59.960
not like something will happen to me.

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:02.360
I'm kind of like maybe have some protection

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.000
because I'm, people see me.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.600
But what the people around you.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:09.920
And we, I've seen that.

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.360
So that's why at a certain point, it's like, that's it.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.200
I can't.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.800
I mean, there's a lot of things to say there,

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:18.680
but one of the difficult things of fame in your situation

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.360
is you're not just having fun.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.000
You're criticizing power.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.120
Yeah.

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.080
And it is loved by the people,

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.680
but it comes with a price because at a certain price,

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:32.200
if the power is too strong and you're not into a situation

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.000
or a system that allows that,

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.040
that gives you that kind of safety.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.480
So what happened?

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.680
What happened?

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.680
I was, so when, so the height of my fame

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.840
when the Muslim brothers were, brotherhood was in power.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.160
And at that time they had their media and I had one show.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:54.600
I had like one hour per week

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.040
and they had five channels, 24 seven.

01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.360
And they were like, you know,

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.240
I'm busy, John Stewart said it beautifully once.

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.480
It's like, we say shit and you say shit

01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.800
and we just say shit better than you.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:08.320
This is exactly what John Stewart was like.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.160
We're just better.

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.680
We're not better at saying shit back at you.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.120
So basically I had one hour

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:14.800
and they have like the five things that they were like,

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.280
you know, they're calling me all kinds of names,

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.320
not just me, like all their enemies, you know?

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.520
And then I just had one hour

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:23.680
and I would kind of like annihilate them in one hour.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.160
So at a certain point, they would even like kind of

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.840
be the side with the army against the kind of,

01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:35.120
the liberal seculars, whatever you call it.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:35.960
And at a certain point,

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.440
the army kind of like flipped everybody.

01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.320
What do you mean?

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:43.320
Like kind of like they removed the Muslim Brotherhood,

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.360
they came to power.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.320
And we, I have to say, I admit it,

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.600
I supported that in the beginning

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.360
because I had daily threats.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.600
I was actually interrogated

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.000
and arrested under the Muslim Brotherhood.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.760
I was in an interrogation for six hours

01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.520
and they were asking me all my jokes

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.040
and I used that in my standup comedy,

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.120
describing exactly what happened in the six hours.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.040
And it is so funny.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.720
Okay, well, it's hilarious.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.520
But what, it slowed down.

01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:12.960
You were interrogated by the Muslim Brotherhood.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.800
The general prosecutor, the general prosecutor.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.120
And it was based because of complaints

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.280
by the officials in the government

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.120
because in order for the general prosecutor to do it,

01:28:21.120 --> 01:28:23.360
it has to have a high up mandate

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.000
to bring that person to questioning.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.560
So they went through kind of official channels.

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.760
Oh yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.600
So it's all-

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.680
Yeah, it was official, it was legal.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.520
Very legal.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:35.880
And I went there and I asked,

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.320
and it's kind of like a bunch of like insulting Islam,

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.560
insulting president, spreading false rumors.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.280
And I went there and it was funny

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.000
because I go into the building

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.880
where there's police officers and there are judges

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:48.120
and all of them are big fans of the show.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.240
And some of them were taking pictures of me.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.320
And then I'm sitting there

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.640
and it was the most ridiculous interview ever

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.080
because he was asking me about my jokes.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:28:58.280
It's like, what did you mean by this joke?

01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.480
And I was like, nothing.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.560
And it was there for six hours.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.400
He's just reading your jokes back to you.

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.000
He was reading my jokes and he's reading the jokes

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.960
and the junior judge is sitting there like cracking up.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.520
It's like, oh, I remember that.

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:15.720
It's like, guys, guys.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.360
That's dark.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:19.320
It's kind of like, and I'm laughing,

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.160
but in the same time,

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.080
it's like the whole situation is ridiculous.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.280
But then at the end I was released on bail.

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.800
So I went back to my show and I make fun of that.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.320
And you have to be honest,

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.000
the Muslim Brotherhood were in power,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.560
but Egypt was like right out of the revolution.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.480
There was kind of like an equal spread of power

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.320
between the people.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:39.680
There was not like someone who would come in

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.520
and just like the Muslim Brotherhood

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:42.920
we didn't have that power yet,

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.840
but there were kind of people saw

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.440
that they were moving towards that.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.800
And then the tension rose.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.200
And then there was like a kind of a confrontation

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.400
between them and the army.

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:53.280
And then a lot of people were killed in the streets.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.840
It was terrible massacre.

01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.680
And then suddenly I am blamed for all of that.

01:29:58.680 --> 01:30:00.480
It's like, you made fun of us.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.480
So now it made it easier for people to kill.

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.920
It's like, dude, come on, you're doing that to me too.

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.240
I just did it better than you.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:08.720
And the fact that you sided with the same people

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.600
that flipped against you, that's not my fault.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.200
Did you criticize the army at all?

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.800
Yeah, so after that show,

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.480
I did like one episode against the army

01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:18.280
and I was canceled the next day.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.600
And then I went to another channel,

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:22.240
did 16 episodes in a different season.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.000
And it was, I was walking on eggshells

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.080
and then that was canceled again.

01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:29.840
And then the production company that was doing my show

01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:33.400
that we severed ties because we didn't have the show.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:35.160
They had their offices raided.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.880
I have people like having death threats.

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:41.360
So I woke up one day, 11th of November, 2014.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:44.560
And my lawyer said like, leave the country right now.

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:48.000
There is this legal case that they kind of like,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.560
they're coming for you.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.720
But I said like, you cannot, it was an arbitration case.

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.200
And I lost against the channel that basically canceled me.

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.280
And it's like, I don't know,

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:59.360
but there's no jail time in arbitration.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.280
It's like, yeah, tell that to the judges, leave.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.440
So I jumped on a plane, the verdict was 12 noon,

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.320
11th of November, five after noon,

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.520
I was on a plane left Egypt

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.120
and I never came back since then.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:16.320
Was there a worry of non-legal things like assassination?

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.320
I can tell you something.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.600
I was so stressed because of the show,

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.800
because of everything.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.920
I sometimes I would wake up in the morning

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.360
and I hope that like bullet will come and finish everything

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.160
because I was so stressed.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.040
It's like, I would love because I'm too much

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.600
of a chicken to kill myself.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.480
So I would like rather have someone else do it for me.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.480
So I was so under so much pressure.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.280
And I remember the day that like my show

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.520
was canceled indefinitely the second time under the army.

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.760
And I was like, I don't have to worry about

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.520
what kind of script I have to write next week.

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:58.920
Remember when you asked me about like that tweet,

01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.760
about like all of those,

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.240
those accusations doesn't bother me.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:07.240
Infidel spy, a secret Jew, Zionist, Slamo-Nazi.

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.400
That's bullshit.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:13.080
What is really, what really leaves a mark

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:15.880
is the criticism to your craft and your work.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:19.760
So you're not funny, goes deeper.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:23.320
Yeah, certain things get to you better than others.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:27.080
Especially if you have like a secret suspicion

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.440
that you are like maybe not funny.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:31.280
Maybe I'm not because I was put into that.

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:33.920
It's like, because that tossed your insecurities like,

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:36.200
I know, but you shouldn't say it out loud.

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.120
Yeah, you shouldn't say the truth out loud.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.520
You shouldn't say it out loud, like give it to yourself.

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:45.600
But what about the weight of the responsibility

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.720
of speaking truth to power?

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:51.040
So like walking on eggshells, like what did that feel like?

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:56.040
Well, after the Muslim Brotherhood were removed,

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.280
you have to understand like when the military coup happened,

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.280
it was a very popular coup.

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.200
Like people loved the army.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:05.440
In Egypt, the army is more sacred than the religion.

01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.120
People loved the army, but the army can go wrong.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.760
So the me going against the army was,

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.600
I mean, the Muslim Brotherhood was not very popular.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:15.080
They were popular for their own basis.

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:18.000
But people accepted the fact that like we make fun of them.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.800
But Sisi at that time, he was a God.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:25.480
And I used to go to this high class club called Gezira Club.

01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:28.840
And this is basically kind of like the kind of

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.120
upper middle class, upper class kind of people.

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.440
And during that year of the Muslim Brotherhood,

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.600
I was the most popular ever.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.600
People come, yay!

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.280
When the military came in, people were walking to me

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:44.160
like pointing their fingers like, don't speak about Sisi.

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.640
Don't speak about the army.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:48.160
We love you now, but don't you do it like that.

01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:52.120
So I called John Stewart, I was like, I don't know what to do.

01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:53.320
I don't know what to do.

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.640
And at that time, all of the channels were like closed down.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.040
All of the, I was the only one left

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:02.480
because it was difficult for them to get rid of me

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.120
very quickly because I was too popular.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:08.960
It was kind of like piece, piecemealing kind of like go.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.560
And I remember I was like, I don't know what to do.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.920
He said like, you don't have to do anything.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.640
Just your safety comes first.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.520
And he said, but I can't.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.520
I mean, I've been doing that for two years

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:22.520
and I cannot just like say, bye-bye guys.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.880
I have a responsibility, I have a team.

01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:25.280
I have people working for me.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.760
And I also, I cannot just like disappear.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.160
And he said the most interesting thing ever.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:37.400
And say, if you're afraid of something,

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:41.080
make fun about the fact that you're afraid of it

01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:42.800
instead of talking about that something.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.080
Brilliant, yeah.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:45.920
So there was like a whole episode

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.520
that we did not even mention Cici.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:49.440
We did not even mention it,

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.880
but the videos did all the thing.

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.840
And the whole episode was me

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.640
trying to avoid talking about him.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.520
And that how the comedy was created.

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.040
The fact that I don't wanna be here.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.680
And then, so he said like,

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:06.040
if you will be surprised how people can relate to that

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.560
because there was a lot of kind of like,

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:11.520
oh, we love him, but we feel we cannot speak.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.120
So just by doing the simple thing

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.920
about mirroring the society.

01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.120
That goes a long way.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.960
And I kind of tried to do what I can under the military.

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.960
I mean, they came up with a machine that treats AIDS

01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:34.920
and hepatitis C virus and basically every single.

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.520
And I went to town with that

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.760
because people think it doesn't really have to go in

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:45.560
to go to the bigger post like, you're an asshole.

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:49.000
No, you talk about their propaganda.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.960
You talk about what they want people to perceive them at.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:55.280
And it's a failure.

01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:57.960
And for that, that kind of hit them even more

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.440
because what do authoritarian figures do?

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.880
They work on two things, fear and propaganda.

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:07.840
And from that, it gets the respect.

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:10.080
So when you go into their propaganda and expose them,

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:11.160
they have nothing else.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.000
That's brilliant.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.440
So like you are walking on eggshells,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:15.480
but you're doing it masterfully.

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.320
That you're revealing sort of the flaws in the propaganda,

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.640
the absurdity of the propaganda

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.320
and so doing or criticizing them.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.720
And this is why comedy is very specific

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.520
because people say, you were not as hard on him

01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.480
as you were in the Muslim Brotherhood.

01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:28.760
Yes, because on the Muslim Brotherhood,

01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:31.560
we were just like saying shit for each other.

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:34.880
But now the ceiling was like here.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.280
So it's kind of like, how can you do something from here?

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.200
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.320
That's the art form.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.720
Yeah, in the Soviet Union under Stalin,

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:47.720
a lot of the criticism came from like children's stories

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.000
and children's cartoons.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.840
Double meaning, doubling windows,

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.400
stuff that means other stuff.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:56.440
That is the brilliance.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.000
But everyone knows.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.440
Everyone knows.

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.000
Because you are like putting a mirror,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.360
like you're mirroring the society.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.200
It's fascinating actually.

01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:05.760
And that's why I was canceled twice.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.480
And that is a scary one, the army.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:11.600
You see that in Ukraine.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.800
Everybody supports the army.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.760
That's why Zelensky getting rid of the head of the army

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:19.800
was a big, big deal.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.400
It's a really dangerous thing.

01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:24.360
Because everyone's afraid to say anything negative

01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.200
about the army, especially during war in that case.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.720
And in this case, maybe there's civil war,

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.560
that kind of thing.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.400
But think about it.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.000
Actually an army during peace is much more dangerous.

01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:35.960
Because think about it.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.520
I don't really have an enemy to fight,

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:40.120
but I have all of this power, all of this tank.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:42.440
Why does this actor have more money than me?

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.440
Yeah.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.240
I'm protecting him.

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.920
Why does this businessman think that he can get

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.640
onto his private plane and go to Paris?

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.480
And why I'm here sitting,

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.200
like not having all of these things.

01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.320
So, and there's a lot of time on your hand,

01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.280
because your job is to go fight.

01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:01.720
When you don't go fight.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.160
And when you have the lack of,

01:38:03.160 --> 01:38:06.840
that's one of the things I love the United States about,

01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:08.800
is the fact that the army cannot really get power,

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.120
but they kind of like, the army is,

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.400
the power is actually in the military,

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.920
in the circumplex, which is a different issue.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.760
Yeah.

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:17.320
It's kind of like a different kind of issue.

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.520
But if you have all of that power,

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.120
like why am I sitting around,

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.720
just like playing guard for you guys?

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.240
That's why Iran is terrifying,

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:26.880
because you have this military that it just becomes

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.880
a police force that turns against its own people.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.720
Yeah.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.040
So you're a famous guy talking shit

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:36.400
in the middle of all that.

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.240
Yeah.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:40.400
When I left, I went through a very dark side,

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.840
dark, dark, dark, because all of the insecurities,

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.680
all of the stuff that had been like working on my head

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.480
now came to life.

01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:50.520
And now I'm in America and I'm a nobody.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.960
I'm a nobody.

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.440
And now it's like, I have to do something,

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.280
I have to earn some money.

01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:57.320
So I started to do standup comedy five years ago.

01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:00.960
And I sucked because it was my second language

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.880
and I was new.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:03.600
And now I will go to these comedy clubs

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.120
with like kids on 21, 22 people.

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.520
And then I'm there with a family to support that.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:11.200
I'm going there to do it for $15, $20.

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.840
And I was bad, I was bad.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:14.680
You're bombing.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.720
Bombing big time.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:16.560
Eating shit.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.800
Eating shit big time.

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:19.400
Dying up there big time.

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.520
And I would go back home and I would cry.

01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:26.040
And then what made it worse is sometimes like a fan,

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.640
not a fan, a bunch of fans from Egypt.

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.400
So I was passing music field and they come.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.240
And then.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.080
And they.

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.360
Yeah, just start.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.920
The voice was there.

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:38.920
That kind of like face of adoration.

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.760
That goes.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.960
And I could see it in their face.

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:48.760
I think he's going to drive an Uber in a couple of weeks.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.280
That's that kind of pressure.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.640
And I would go and I would cry.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.680
And then essentially, oh, you left.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.720
You gave up.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:39:59.560
You were a sellout.

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:00.720
You were a coward.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.200
Why don't you speak from abroad?

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.400
You're safe now.

01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:05.400
I already spoke.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.160
I don't want to be,

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.960
because I don't want to be an activist.

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.440
I was doing that for comedy

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.760
when it was good for everybody.

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.840
But now they want me to go into YouTube

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:17.000
and just like throw rocks from outside.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.040
And it's like, you know what, I understand.

01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:19.000
I have family there.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:23.000
And it was this kind of like thing

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.680
like that I am being attacked

01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.080
for not doing what I should do in their face.

01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.000
And attacked for not being funny.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:31.920
And not doing good.

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.000
And now I feel like maybe it was wrong.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.480
And I was, I didn't know.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:38.920
I really, it was so traumatic

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.440
that I don't know actually how I went through these years.

01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:44.240
And I blocked so many details from my brain

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.240
because I have been using this technique for a while now

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.760
that I have been erasing a lot of my,

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:56.760
there is a lot of memory gaps in my brain.

01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.240
And I'm trying to suppress it

01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:00.960
because it was very, very, very traumatic.

01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.400
And a lot of people told me you have to go to therapy

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.760
but I don't, I can't, I don't know.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.600
I'm worried to open the floodgates.

01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.200
And I'm thinking as if I'm functional

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:13.400
and I'm not killing anybody, I'm okay.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:18.040
I was like, I think Elon tweeted,

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.320
never went to therapy.

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.520
It's gonna be on my headstone.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:22.360
Yeah.

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.560
To your best buds.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:27.800
Okay.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:32.120
I mean, that is like terrifyingly difficult to,

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.960
like after being a surgeon,

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:38.440
after being a superstar, super famous,

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:43.440
going to eat shit at local tiny clubs in the United States.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.240
I mean, eating shit period.

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.080
Yeah.

01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.840
Like bombing is really, really, really difficult,

01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.200
really difficult for 20 year olds.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.240
Imagine when you're 45, 46 and then people's like,

01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:57.600
is this his midlife crisis?

01:41:58.440 --> 01:41:59.280
What is this?

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.280
I went through a lot of pain and a lot of like the doubts

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.160
and it was terrible.

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.000
Wait, I mean, how did you survive?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.440
I know you bought most of it,

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.920
but what gave you like strength through all that?

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.760
Because I didn't have any other choice

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.280
because I started that.

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.600
And the only reason that I could is to continue.

01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:22.840
I don't know what else to do.

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:24.400
I don't want to go back to medicine.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:27.440
I don't want to go, I don't want to do that.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:31.280
And bit by bit, bit by bit,

01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:35.080
I started to kind of like be better, be better, be better.

01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:39.120
And I was at a certain time, a year ago, a year ago,

01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.720
this is where I started to kind of like hone the craft

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.720
and kind of sell more tickets

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:47.200
and sometimes even sell out some shows

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.320
and sometimes sell a theater.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.040
So like it was going and the money was flowing

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.880
and it was good.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.200
And then I was like, why didn't, I wanted faster.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:57.000
I wanted more.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:57.840
I want it now.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.040
I want Netflix deal or whatever.

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.320
And then the Piers Morgan thing happened

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.160
and then I blew up.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:03.800
And then suddenly I'm selling out everywhere.

01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.760
And it's like, ah, if those people came,

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:09.840
if the war happened two years ago, I will not be ready.

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.280
So now they come to the show.

01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:14.640
And by the way, my show had nothing to do

01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:15.880
with the October 7th.

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:18.240
My show is my thing that I've been crafting

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.120
and working on, you know, how difficult it is

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.160
to do the first hour,

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:25.200
the hour that I've been working on for five years.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.800
And it's all my personal story.

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.520
All of what like what happened to me

01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:30.200
as an immigrant coming here to the United States,

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:31.440
finding Trump as a president,

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:33.760
finding myself in the middle of a gun rally,

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.280
finding myself in the middle of a bombing,

01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:37.400
kind of like talking about how I got my citizenship.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.480
It's all like funny stories.

01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:41.000
I want like my origin story.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.880
So they come in and they expect October 7th

01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.120
and all of a sudden it's my personal story,

01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:46.040
but it's good and it kills and they love it.

01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:49.000
It's like, if that kind of like blew up in America

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.640
happened to me two, three years ago,

01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:54.360
I would not have people who come and be disappointed.

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:57.240
I gotta say, the timing of October 7th is very suspicious.

01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.600
Oh my God, please don't say that.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.680
I don't know.

01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.560
I'm just asking questions, I don't know.

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:03.920
I'm telling you, one of the funniest thing,

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:08.400
a guy, I was in Dubai and like a TV anchor came to me,

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:11.440
pass him, Youssef, he flourishes during revolutions

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:13.320
and wars, like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what, what?

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:17.360
Dude, you're making me sound like a bad omen,

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.200
a very bad omen.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.480
Yeah, you, Hamas and Bibi together orchestrated all of this.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:25.920
Oh my God, that's the, that's the trilogy.

01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.720
You guys should go on the road together.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.240
Telling you that phone call is coming.

01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.640
Yeah, but Hamas has to open.

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.440
And they would really bomb, right?

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:37.840
They would really bomb.

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:42.720
I love dark humor.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.440
You do a show like you were saying,

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.360
in English and in Arabic.

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.160
So, and the story is very different.

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.040
Totally different, two different stories.

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:54.720
I would love to just the language difference

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.200
because it's the music of the language is also different.

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:00.680
So like what, what's, how can you convert it into words?

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:02.480
But what's, what's the difference

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.840
in the music of the languages?

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.320
I'll tell you.

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.760
Because I thought about that a lot.

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:11.760
So, when I was doing the English first, I was,

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:17.640
I actually had good jokes, but I was missing the delivery

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.360
because the cadence and the music and the rhythm is different.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.920
The way that an English speaking American member

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:27.640
of audience will receive it, it will be different

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.720
than how I receive it.

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:30.360
The energy, everything's different.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.120
So, when I kind of like got it,

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.280
I didn't know how to switch back to Arabic.

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:41.680
Oh, wow.

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.080
Yeah, fascinating.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.720
Because here's the thing, with English stand-up comedy,

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.920
English stand-up, you have a huge library.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.360
You have like a legacy, you have like years

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.560
and years and years and years of people doing comedy.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:51.880
But in Arabic, it's a very new, very new to us.

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:53.640
And most of the Arabic stand-up comedy,

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:56.680
especially in Egypt, is very tamed.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.480
This is kind of like, imagine the stand-up comedy scene

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.760
in America, 1960s, before Lenny Bruce.

01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.280
Oh, so no swearing, conservative, careful.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:09.600
No swearing, nothing conservative, everything kind of like,

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:12.280
yeah, it's kind of like very, so,

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:15.280
I didn't know what to do with Arabic.

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.600
So, I broke the barriers.

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.680
I became Lenny Bruce, I became a Jewish con.

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.080
So, I went in and I went, and I changed the whole thing.

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:23.080
Seven words, you're not allowed to say what I said.

01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:24.920
For me, 15 words.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:25.760
How?

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.600
Yeah, that's a lot.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:28.120
That's a lot.

01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:29.760
Arabic is a very rich language.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.640
Yeah.

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.280
So, when I did, here's the difference

01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:36.280
between the Arabic and the English show.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:40.160
The English show, surprise, surprise,

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.720
is a unifying language, even for a group of Arabs.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.040
So, if I give the same exact show

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.000
to the same 1,000 audience members in the same theater,

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.240
and they're the same people,

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.800
same makeup of like Lebanese, Egyptian, Syrian, Saudis,

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.680
English will be a unifying language.

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:01.640
Arabic is a dividing language,

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.240
because you have 22 dialects,

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.080
and the dialects are vastly different.

01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:07.120
And like, maybe Egyptians understand

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.720
a little bit of Lebanese, but not that much.

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:11.640
But the references, Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian,

01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:12.640
totally different animal.

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:14.160
That's like a totally different language.

01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:16.640
Saudi, Emirati, Kuwaiti, totally different.

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.120
People understand the Egyptian dialect,

01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.400
because it's the dialect of most of the artwork

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.840
and the movies.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.840
But the reference in the everyday street talk

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.280
might not be understood by them.

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.760
So, now I have to go in,

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.040
and talk to all of these dialects together.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:35.560
So, I formed my, big part of my show is like,

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:39.080
what are you guys expecting of this?

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:41.280
This is what, this is, we gonna,

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.720
when I do profanity, and you're gonna like it,

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.560
this is the problem with the show as a dialect,

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.240
and I construct all of these sentences

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:53.360
formed of so different, different words.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.920
For example, an iron,

01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.600
in any, in any, in any Arabic dialect is an iron.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.040
In Saudi Arabia, it means ass.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.320
That's one example.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.880
That's one example, you know?

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.560
So, imagine if you can actually construct sentences,

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.240
having all of these things in one sentence.

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.280
So, I would construct like a whole section

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:13.840
of my show about that.

01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:15.680
So, it's really very much about,

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.520
like self-reflective on language,

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.320
and the limits of language that's allowed.

01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.280
And the limits of language,

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.880
and I tell them, part of the show is like,

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.800
I know what's the problem with me doing Arabic.

01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:25.120
It's like, if this was an English show,

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.320
and I was telling you, fuck, and shit,

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:27.680
I bet you'll be, ha, ha, ha,

01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:30.400
but if I do one swear word, all of you will cringe.

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.240
Yeah.

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.160
It's like, why?

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.200
Is it because we are ashamed?

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.040
Yeah.

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.240
So, it's kind of like, it's not just like about swearing.

01:48:38.240 --> 01:48:41.800
It's about like, there's a lot of philosophical pathways

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.160
in this.

01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:45.040
Yeah, there's profanity, and people have fun, whatever,

01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.920
but like, it is about like, what does it,

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.840
how do we treat our language?

01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:51.720
And I tell them, we speak Arabic as Arabs,

01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:53.960
but it's not the same Arabic.

01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:54.800
It's crazy, right?

01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:56.400
And you're doing the show in America also,

01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.640
which is another level of-

01:48:57.640 --> 01:48:59.640
Oh yeah, actually, the Arab diaspora in America

01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.960
is some of the best audiences I have.

01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:05.880
They are like wonderful, and they come from,

01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:09.000
and I did it also in the Middle East,

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.480
and maybe I'll do like an Arab tour

01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:12.040
in the Middle East in the fall.

01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:14.560
Which countries would you go to and not?

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.520
I would, Jordan, Lebanon, I'm doing UAE,

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.080
I'm doing Kuwait, Egypt, Bahrain.

01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.680
Egypt, I don't think so.

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.680
I don't think so.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.440
Is it personal?

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.840
Is it worry about your safety?

01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.120
Well, I have the American citizenship right now,

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:34.560
so I am relatively safe.

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:37.200
There's a block, honestly.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.160
There's a block.

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:42.160
There's a person, there's so much that happened.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.680
And I know never bad mouth Egypt.

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:45.520
This is my country.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.320
It has all of my memories.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.400
40 years of my life I lived there.

01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.840
But when you get hurt so much,

01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.040
instead of trying to kind of,

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I don't wanna take revenge, I don't wanna like,

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.160
I just want to avoid.

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:02.240
Because Egypt gave me so much fame,

01:50:02.240 --> 01:50:05.560
and so much love, and so much hate, and so much rejection.

01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:10.560
It is a very, it was a very tumulus relationship.

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:12.600
Very, very difficult.

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.240
And a lot of people tell me, well, don't you miss Egypt?

01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:17.760
And I tell them every time,

01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.600
the Egypt that I miss is not there anymore.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.160
It's not bad or good.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.680
It's not worse or better.

01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.160
It's just, I'm different, and the places are different,

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.080
and the people are different,

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.520
and the circumstances are different.

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.400
Whatever image you have of what you love

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.240
is not there anymore.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:32.240
That's why a lot of immigrants,

01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:35.120
especially Arab immigrants, they live here,

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.400
but they're there.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.200
And then when they go back for a vacation,

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.040
they get disappointed

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:40.840
because they didn't find what they want.

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.760
And then they come back here,

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.600
and they're disappointed

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.160
because this is what they wanna come back,

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:46.960
but it's not there anymore.

01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:51.920
Yeah, their view of that place is from a different time.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:54.440
I have that, you know, my parents,

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.140
but everybody that left the Soviet Union,

01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.840
I mean, it's such a complicated relationship with that.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:06.040
It's sometimes borders on hate, disappointment.

01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:08.680
In the case of the Soviet Union,

01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:10.080
perhaps similar to Egypt,

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:12.840
is the promises sold when you were younger,

01:51:12.840 --> 01:51:15.280
and the promise is broken

01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.760
by the possibility of what it was supposed to be.

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.240
With the Soviet Union, I'm sure with Egypt is the same.

01:51:21.240 --> 01:51:22.600
Iran is the same.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.480
So they have a very complicated relationship with that.

01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:28.680
Yeah, that's why, like for example, people from Iran,

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:30.480
you know, I remember quite well

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:34.480
the World Cup that was made in the United States,

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.680
and the Iranian team were playing in America,

01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:40.880
and there were people in the audience all wearing Iranian,

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:42.320
they hate the regime,

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:46.120
but they have this kind of connection with the country.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.760
And this is the whole thing.

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:49.280
You can actually love the country,

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:51.440
and you not have to agree with the regime.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.400
Would you ever perform in the West Bank?

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:57.360
No. Gaza.

01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:58.320
Because if I go there,

01:51:58.320 --> 01:51:59.980
I have to go to the Israeli checkpoints,

01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.140
and I don't want to go through this.

01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:03.580
I don't want to have an Israeli soldier

01:52:03.580 --> 01:52:04.700
telling me what to do.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:06.540
Yeah, there's a demeaning aspect to that whole.

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.380
Very.

01:52:07.380 --> 01:52:09.140
Even in subtle ways, yeah.

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:09.980
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:12.660
I mean, I have so many Palestinian friends

01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:15.020
with an American passport, US passport, living here.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:16.260
They are born here.

01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:18.420
And they talk about the humiliation,

01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:21.500
and the intimidation, and the harassment that they go in.

01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:24.900
It's like, do you want me to try?

01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:27.340
Yeah, that little bit of a humiliation.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.140
A little bit.

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:32.420
Well, sometimes it's major,

01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.260
but I noticed that even the little bit,

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:38.860
after a lifetime of that,

01:52:38.860 --> 01:52:42.420
it can turn to hate towards the other.

01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:43.740
Yeah, and resentment.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:44.580
Resentment.

01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:47.180
And then how do you do anything with that resentment?

01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:48.420
I have a friend of mine.

01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:50.660
He is from Palestine, from the West Bank.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.860
He's American here, he's born here.

01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:55.700
And we talk about,

01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.500
we have, of course, all of this discussion

01:52:57.500 --> 01:52:58.340
of what would happen.

01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.420
And he tells me, in October 11th, in the West Bank,

01:53:01.420 --> 01:53:05.420
and there was a village called Kosra.

01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:09.420
And on that village, the settlers went in,

01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:11.140
around the village, and they send a message on Facebook,

01:53:11.140 --> 01:53:13.740
it's like, you rats, get out of your sewers,

01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.020
and we're gonna be waiting for you.

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.140
Intimidation through technology.

01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:19.100
And then they went,

01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:23.660
Kosra have another settlement next to it,

01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:25.500
called Eshkodesh.

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:28.100
Eshkodesh, they have people there

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:32.100
who were training something called Mishmireti Yisha,

01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.500
which is basically the guardians of Yisha.

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.580
And it's like a paramilitary group

01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:40.580
that trains other settlers on military combat.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.540
Give them weapons and do like military drills.

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:46.740
And they went there, like militarized, and went there.

01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:50.740
And it was actually co-founded by a Jew from Brooklyn.

01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:53.900
Not even, and like an Israeli.

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:56.420
And he is like one of the disciples of Meir Kahane.

01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.420
I'm sure that you know who Meir Kahane is,

01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:00.420
who was the Jewish defense lead,

01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:02.780
the people who assassinated Alex Aouda

01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:04.220
here in the United States.

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:08.740
And they were there with their weapons outside,

01:54:08.740 --> 01:54:09.580
intimidating people.

01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:12.020
Now, this story carries everything

01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:13.620
that is wrong with the situation.

01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:15.540
You have people from Brooklyn, from outside,

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.140
just because they're Jewish, they can't come

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.460
and they can't claim the land.

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:20.060
Just because they're Jewish, they can't come

01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:22.100
and they can't claim the land from the people there.

01:54:22.100 --> 01:54:23.620
Anybody from Poland, just because he's Jewish,

01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:25.860
he can come and take the land from other people.

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:28.780
They're using technology to intimidate Palestinians.

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:31.220
They have unchecked military power.

01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:33.100
These are not IDF soldiers.

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.220
These are settlers, and they have free reign

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:37.180
in order to intimidate and to kill the people.

01:54:37.180 --> 01:54:40.540
And you understand, this is the daily life of Palestinians.

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:42.620
Not in Gaza, in the West Bank.

01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.100
What do you do from your, what do we do?

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.300
What do people do?

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:53.740
To nudge this towards peace, towards flourishing.

01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:00.100
Here's the thing, I wanna talk to the people of Israel.

01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:01.540
What is Israel doing right now,

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:05.220
is not just unfair to the Palestinians,

01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:07.260
it's unfair to the Jewish people in Israel.

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:10.660
No, it is unfair to the Jewish people around the world.

01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:15.660
Because the way that Israel links itself to Judaism,

01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:16.980
at a certain point,

01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:21.140
remember ISIS and Qaeda, and when everybody hated Muslims?

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.500
Sometimes humans are simple.

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.540
They cannot have the nuances to separate.

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:30.220
So anybody with a Muslim name, with a Muslim face,

01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:31.580
with a beard, who looks Muslim,

01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:35.220
he would do it because of that actions of those atrocities.

01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:38.980
You have the power as a person to separate yourself

01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.060
from an abusive power, a horrible power, and be yourself.

01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:46.660
I am really worried because the rise of antisemitism

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:50.100
and the rise of hate against Jews is not because of the Jews,

01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.260
it's because of the actions of a government.

01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:55.620
Jews do not have to be on the side of apartheid.

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:59.540
Ronny Kestrels, he is a Jewish South African,

01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.740
and he fought shoulder to shoulder next to Nelson Mandela.

01:56:02.740 --> 01:56:05.380
He was part of the African National Conference ANC.

01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.380
And he had an article saying, like,

01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:09.380
I know what apartheid is, and I saw Israel,

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:10.740
and this is what they have.

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.540
And the thing is Israel, that Israeli government

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:17.100
should listen to other people.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.460
You cannot call anybody who criticizes you

01:56:20.460 --> 01:56:22.940
either an antisemite or if they're already Jewish,

01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.540
you call them like self-hating Jew.

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:25.820
You cannot do that.

01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.820
You cannot continue doing that because we did that.

01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:30.060
When I would go in and criticize the Islamists,

01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:31.420
it's like, oh, you're self-hating Muslim.

01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:32.860
You're not really Muslim.

01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:33.500
You're an infidel.

01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:33.980
You're a secret.

01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:34.940
You're a secular or whatever.

01:56:35.900 --> 01:56:42.140
We have the power in order to reform the course

01:56:42.700 --> 01:56:44.300
by holding people in power accountable.

01:56:44.540 --> 01:56:46.860
And the thing is, it is very stupid

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:48.620
to actually call this antisemitism.

01:56:48.620 --> 01:56:51.900
Like, my idol is Jon Stewart.

01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:53.260
I voted for Bernie Sanders.

01:56:55.260 --> 01:56:57.820
Sarah Taxler, the one who did this amazing documentary

01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:59.420
about me, Tickling Giants.

01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:00.140
She's a Jew.

01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:01.980
She is married to an Israeli Jew.

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.460
We have a good ratio because we know what the right is.

01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:06.460
They don't have to associate themselves

01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:07.900
with the action of the Israeli government.

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.340
One of your favorite words, Jihad.

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:14.620
That's my favorite hobbies.

01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:22.220
I talk about how when a white shooter does something,

01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:23.580
he talks about all of his family.

01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:27.500
And I was like, what if we did this for Arab terrorists?

01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:28.540
What are his hobbies?

01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:29.040
Jihad.

01:57:34.620 --> 01:57:36.060
Wow, you're making me feel good.

01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:36.960
Okay.

01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:42.540
Sam Harris has done several episodes on Jihad,

01:57:43.260 --> 01:57:48.060
and people should go listen to it even if you disagree with it.

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:51.340
But the basic idea that he's proposing

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.100
is that this idea of Jihad,

01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.580
in the negative connotation of it,

01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:58.780
of martyrdom is a thing that gets,

01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:00.780
is counterproductive,

01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:05.580
is destructive to the possible future flourishing

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.620
of Palestinian people.

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:09.820
What do you think of that?

01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:10.860
There's just the idea of martyrdom.

01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:11.660
I totally agree.

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.420
But people don't wake up in the morning

01:58:13.420 --> 01:58:14.780
and say, like, I want to declare Jihad.

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:17.020
Think about it.

01:58:17.020 --> 01:58:20.380
Why would anybody choose to end his life

01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:23.020
by taking other people with him and end that life?

01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.860
His life must be miserable.

01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:27.340
He must be pushed into that.

01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:30.860
Nobody chooses death over life willingly.

01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:33.740
One of the first suicide bombers

01:58:34.460 --> 01:58:36.620
in the Palestinian resistance were Christians.

01:58:38.620 --> 01:58:39.580
We don't talk about that.

01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:44.700
I think he would say that the presence of a story

01:58:44.700 --> 01:58:45.820
that you can tell yourself

01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:47.740
when you're in a really shitty place,

01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:50.540
that you can go to a much better place

01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:52.860
by sacrificing your own life,

01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:56.460
just the fact that the presence of that story is there is harmful.

01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.740
Of course.

01:58:57.740 --> 01:59:01.420
But here's my problem with Sam Harris.

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:04.700
And usually people, they have free range

01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:06.300
talking about the Islamic faith

01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:10.940
and nitpicking the stuff that makes it put in a bad light.

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.740
I can go and nitpick every single religion.

01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.420
There are Jews there, like Bin Ghafir,

01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:19.340
who openly say spitting on Christians

01:59:19.340 --> 01:59:20.220
is not a hate speech.

01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:21.500
All right.

01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:26.860
You can bring me all kinds of videos of Islamic jihadists

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:29.260
saying horrible things on YouTube.

01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:30.780
And I can bring you Jews who live there.

01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:33.340
We're going to have the whole world enslaved for us

01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:35.340
and everybody would love to be slaves for the Jews.

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.820
I can use the Talmudic argument

01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:42.860
that if you tie a man to a tree

01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.540
and he dies of thirst and hunger,

01:59:44.540 --> 01:59:45.660
you didn't kill that man.

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:48.060
And this is kind of the same arguments like,

01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:49.180
we're not killing Palestinians.

01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:51.180
It's just like killing and they're dying by themselves.

01:59:53.180 --> 01:59:56.380
The nitpicking of a certain narrative,

01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:59.100
religious narrative that is separate

01:59:59.100 --> 02:00:01.260
from the political context

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.860
and what's happening right now,

02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:04.860
it's very, very unfair because I can read.

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:07.900
If you want to have a deep dive into religious texts,

02:00:08.620 --> 02:00:09.820
nobody will be happy.

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:12.620
And I can bring stuff from the Talmud and the Torah

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:14.060
and stuff that is horrible.

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:20.140
But this is a way again of distraction.

02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:22.940
I dare you to talk shit about Buddhism and Jainism though.

02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:27.820
Well, the people who killed the Muslims in Myanmar,

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.180
weren't they Buddhist?

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:31.100
Yeah, well, let's go Jain.

02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.300
Okay, I'll find religion.

02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:33.260
I've got to get back to you.

02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:33.900
I'll have to find it.

02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:36.540
Yeah, the flying monster,

02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:39.500
the church of the flying monster, Spaghetti.

02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:44.220
As a person who tries not to eat carbs,

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:45.420
I'm deeply offended by that.

02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.460
I mean, they're Scientologists.

02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:47.900
All they do is actually buy real estate.

02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:52.540
I think there's a few books written

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.460
about the fact that they do other stuff as well.

02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:59.820
So even there, Mormons sometimes,

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.580
they're some of the nicest people I've ever met.

02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:04.140
But I'm sure there's also darkness there too.

02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:06.780
Oh boy, religion.

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:10.220
There's soaking in Mormon.

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:11.980
There's what?

02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:12.620
Soaking.

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:13.580
What's soaking?

02:01:13.580 --> 02:01:15.340
Okay, so I don't know how much.

02:01:15.340 --> 02:01:19.340
So soaking basically, if you get into the woman

02:01:20.300 --> 02:01:23.580
and you don't move, that's not adultery.

02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.180
That's not like-

02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:25.980
Oh, interesting.

02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:28.700
There's a loophole.

02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.260
There's a loophole.

02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:32.060
Religion has a loophole.

02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:34.060
Yes, and Muslims who do that the whole time,

02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:35.980
we pick and choose our sins,

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.260
the stuff that we enjoy.

02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:38.940
It's just, we're humans.

02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:40.860
72 versions waiting for all of us.

02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:43.260
Maybe if I converted you as a Jew, I'll get you 80.

02:01:43.260 --> 02:01:44.940
I don't know, you know, like we can negotiate.

02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:48.060
But I also have questions about whether-

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:49.100
It'll be a very good deal.

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.740
I'll give you, and maybe I'll throw there a Camry.

02:01:51.740 --> 02:01:54.940
I have to be honest, Camry, it's pretty good.

02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:56.380
What year?

02:01:56.380 --> 02:01:58.380
I don't know, 1998.

02:01:58.380 --> 02:01:59.660
Best year ever.

02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:00.860
Well, they last a long time.

02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:05.020
I'm not sure I want 70, 72.

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.180
I'll throw five in the mix and see how it feels.

02:02:08.700 --> 02:02:09.420
If you want to upgrade.

02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:12.300
Can we do a trial period?

02:02:13.740 --> 02:02:15.180
But in general, if you just zoom out,

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:19.420
do you think religion is,

02:02:19.420 --> 02:02:20.780
in what way is it good for the world,

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:21.900
in what way is it harmful?

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:23.740
If there was no religion,

02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:25.500
humans would have invented religion.

02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:28.700
Because think about, think of like the early humanity.

02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:30.540
Like you're like a caveman or whatever,

02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:32.620
and then like you see your family members killed,

02:02:32.620 --> 02:02:33.660
and then you say like, what?

02:02:33.660 --> 02:02:36.220
I'm going to be like the cheetah or the gazelle

02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:37.420
that just like ends and perish.

02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:40.700
I need to have, I am more important.

02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:42.620
I think I think with the development of consciousness,

02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:47.580
humans like thought that they are much more

02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:50.380
precious and important than the other animals

02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:51.580
because they have now intelligence.

02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:54.620
So my life will not end like that.

02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:57.980
They will, my death will be even more important.

02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:00.060
There's consequences for that.

02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:01.580
There's consequences for what I do.

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:05.900
And then the early man was like there in the desert

02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:07.580
and all of these like natural phenomena.

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.220
They didn't know what to do.

02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:08.860
They were afraid.

02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:10.620
So they need to have refuge.

02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.220
They need to have something to take care of.

02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:14.300
They need to have a reason for everything.

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:17.420
Because if there's no reason, it's chaos.

02:03:18.620 --> 02:03:19.260
It's chaos.

02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:19.900
It's terrifying.

02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:20.700
It's terrifying.

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:21.260
It's terrifying.

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:21.820
There's nothing.

02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:24.140
There has to be a reason.

02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:24.940
There has to be a reason.

02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.220
There has to be a purpose.

02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:28.460
There has to be like a cause, something.

02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:31.740
It's just I'm not just going to be like die

02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:33.580
like like a cockroach being stepped on.

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.060
And that's kind of like part of this ego.

02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:38.780
The whole world rotates around you in a way.

02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:39.660
It's the ego.

02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:44.300
So religion actually got a lot of it from humanity itself.

02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:46.460
Like me, like us being humans.

02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:51.740
And there's and many religion is a collection of stories.

02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:55.340
And those stories based on things that humans did themselves

02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:57.100
and they attributed it to gods.

02:03:57.100 --> 02:04:00.380
And there's an aspect of religion where you humble yourself

02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:03.420
before a thing that is much greater than you.

02:04:03.420 --> 02:04:07.980
So that has a, I would say, a very positive effect of humbling.

02:04:07.980 --> 02:04:09.580
It will be great if you stop there.

02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.020
But here's the thing.

02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:14.940
If you humble in order that your ego kicks in

02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:16.700
and feel that you are better than someone else

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:18.380
who's not humbled in front of the same god.

02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:19.340
Go there.

02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:23.980
That means that I will have all that train that I can use that.

02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:25.900
Because now what does it mean being humble?

02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:26.860
I'm divine.

02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:29.660
Yeah, but I'm still, I'm way more humble than you.

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:30.860
Ah, but you're not.

02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:33.260
So you see how they kind of like the oxymoron.

02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:34.620
I'm humble and I'm surrendering,

02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:37.100
but in the same time I am better than you and I'm more entitled.

02:04:37.100 --> 02:04:38.380
Isn't it crazy?

02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:40.540
Yeah, it's beautiful.

02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:41.420
It's crazy.

02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:43.260
I mean, look at, look, look at like,

02:04:43.260 --> 02:04:45.420
like the Muslim Christians and Jews and everything.

02:04:45.420 --> 02:04:47.020
It's like, all right, Muslims, we surrendered.

02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:48.380
I'm talking about the extreme ones.

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:51.500
I mean, like people, like people say, I surrender to God.

02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:53.180
Good. Keep it that way.

02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.980
Like if you go to, I surrender to God.

02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:57.900
That means that I am closer to God than you,

02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.340
then you should die.

02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.860
Okay, Christians, Christ is love and he loves me

02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:04.060
and we're going to be together,

02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:06.860
but you don't get into his kingdom and you die.

02:05:06.860 --> 02:05:07.900
You see, it's the same thing.

02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:13.500
It's just, if you stop there, stop where you are humble

02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.380
and you feel that you're a piece of shit

02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.500
and you are worthless human being and you are there.

02:05:20.220 --> 02:05:21.100
Stop there.

02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:24.380
But once you say like, oh, that makes me a better person than you.

02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:26.380
And it makes me more with God than you.

02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:30.220
So that would give me the entitlement to kick your ass.

02:05:30.220 --> 02:05:32.460
Yeah, we always ruin a good thing.

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:32.940
Don't we?

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:35.420
That ego.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:39.820
You've been outspoken, you know, with Piers Morgan,

02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:47.020
but just on this topic and you talked about the Superman story,

02:05:47.900 --> 02:05:50.860
which I would love it if you were in a Superman movie.

02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:53.580
But have you lost job opportunities?

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:55.180
Because of this?

02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.380
There was a couple of things that were going on,

02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.700
but they stopped again.

02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.380
I don't know if it's October 7th.

02:06:02.380 --> 02:06:05.580
You know, the Superman story, so what role were you?

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:06.540
Okay.

02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:07.820
What did you audition for?

02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:08.380
Yeah, it's okay.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:14.140
So in June, I was traveling to Dubai

02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:18.300
and right an hour before I get into the car and go there,

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:20.620
my manager is like, best, I'm going to send you a script, read it.

02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:21.740
It's for Superman.

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.860
It's like, oh, Superman, you know,

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.100
I'm not really good in auditions.

02:06:25.100 --> 02:06:26.060
I'm not an assistant actor.

02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.740
So I was like, okay, I'm just going to do it.

02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:28.300
Send the tape.

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:31.020
I do the tape, I send it.

02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:35.340
I go to the airport and I think I can talk about it now

02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:36.940
because they said they changed the script.

02:06:36.940 --> 02:06:40.060
So basically what I found interesting in that new script

02:06:40.060 --> 02:06:43.740
is that there is like a dictator in a country

02:06:43.740 --> 02:06:45.100
that invades another country

02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:48.860
and Superman interferes politically.

02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:51.900
That's the first time we ever see Superman interfere politically.

02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:54.060
So basically it was like Russia and Ukraine.

02:06:54.060 --> 02:06:55.740
But because of me, it was like it had,

02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:56.940
it couldn't be Russia and Ukraine.

02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:59.100
So it had to be something kind of like with a flavor.

02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:03.020
So I read the role as if as a mixture of Trump and Mubarak.

02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:07.820
I did this mix and like, you know,

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:09.820
I had like the kind of the middle piece,

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.860
but also like kind of like the essence of Trump into it.

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:16.940
I went to the airport.

02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:17.740
It's like an hour.

02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:19.100
It's like James Gunn saw it.

02:07:19.100 --> 02:07:19.740
He loves it.

02:07:20.220 --> 02:07:21.820
I never had an audition that fast.

02:07:21.820 --> 02:07:24.380
I mean, I had a few roles, but not that fast.

02:07:24.380 --> 02:07:24.940
Not like that.

02:07:26.060 --> 02:07:30.620
And then I said like, well, the strike starts like tomorrow

02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.380
and we need to be on the phone.

02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.500
But after the strike, we cannot talk.

02:07:33.500 --> 02:07:36.700
The sag after strike, like where the writers and the actors strike.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.140
So like, well, I'm going to be on a plane right now.

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:41.500
It's like, once you land, you can have a Zoom call with James Gunn.

02:07:42.140 --> 02:07:43.340
I have a call with James Gunn.

02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:45.660
I am a huge fan of him.

02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:47.900
The guy took like something like Guardian of the Galaxy.

02:07:47.900 --> 02:07:50.460
Nobody knew about it, made amazing trilogy.

02:07:50.460 --> 02:07:52.540
And he is like a really cool guy.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:53.260
I like what he did.

02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:55.580
And it was like really nice.

02:07:55.580 --> 02:07:57.820
And he started to talk to me about the movie.

02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.340
And, you know, like I talked to people before casting them.

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.980
So I know that everybody's on set, have a good chemistry.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:05.020
It was amazing.

02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:08.540
So in your mind, if you're an actor, what does that mean?

02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:09.340
You got the part.

02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:10.700
And he told me, you got the part.

02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:15.180
Month goes by, strike goes by.

02:08:15.180 --> 02:08:16.460
October 7th happens.

02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:18.780
I do Piers Morgan, one and two.

02:08:18.780 --> 02:08:20.940
And then I go to my Australian tour.

02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:21.820
My manager called me.

02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:23.340
The circus was over.

02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:25.660
It's like, you don't get the part anymore.

02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:29.740
I was sad, very sad, but for three days.

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:31.180
And so like, I'm going to need to stand up with it.

02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:33.020
I'm actually doing very well.

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:41.260
And then when I went to Chris Como,

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:46.780
I, after I finished the show, he told me, did you lose any opportunities?

02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.620
And that was off record after the show was like, we concluded.

02:08:50.620 --> 02:08:55.180
And I said, I talked about Superman and I found myself when I was talking, I was angry.

02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:56.780
I was bitter.

02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:58.220
And I went home.

02:08:58.220 --> 02:08:59.180
It's like, why was I angry?

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:00.780
Why was I bitter?

02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:02.620
It wasn't meant to be.

02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.140
And I'm living a good life now.

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:05.900
I don't need to.

02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:10.380
So when I was asked again, the next day in two different interviews,

02:09:10.380 --> 02:09:13.980
the BBC and the other, and another one was alone with my friend, you know, with Allah.

02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:16.940
I said the story in a different way.

02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:19.180
I said, I don't have any anger.

02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:22.780
As a matter of fact, maybe if I was Wander Brothers, I didn't talk about James Gunn.

02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:23.580
I thought it was the studio.

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:29.020
If I was Wander Brothers and I'm a Muslim, I wouldn't have like a Zionist or a pro-Israeli

02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:34.300
in my movie, but I want to tell them that like, when I criticize Israel, I am not a

02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:37.660
threat to you as a Jew and we can actually have more in common.

02:09:37.660 --> 02:09:39.260
And we can actually have more in common.

02:09:39.260 --> 02:09:41.340
I was more of a kind of empathic.

02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:43.980
So when I said that, the internet went crazy.

02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:48.540
And, you know, James Gunn have haters because, you know, the, the Snyder verse and all of

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:50.860
the, it's just, it's a word that I don't understand.

02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:57.660
And James Gunn, like I had all of these attacks on him.

02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:00.780
And I was pissed of how it was handled.

02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:03.260
I wasn't angry at James Gunn, but I thought it was.

02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:08.140
And so my publicist, I'm just like, stay calm, don't speak.

02:10:08.140 --> 02:10:11.260
It's better like to, to like, not talk about it.

02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:12.540
I said, okay.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:17.580
So as there's nothing wrong about me, but I see the heat is rising against James Gunn.

02:10:17.580 --> 02:10:20.700
And that is a guy that I had a personal connection with even through Zoom.

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:22.620
And I didn't like what was happening.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:26.460
And then he called me and he explained to me, I said, you know, I actually use,

02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:30.380
like have camera tests before people before, finally, I didn't know that.

02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:33.660
And I, and then we changed the script and it was the strike.

02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:34.300
So I didn't call.

02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:35.900
And I also, I thought to myself, I'm small.

02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:36.620
I'm a small actor.

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:40.300
I'm not that important for him to call me to say, we're going to change the script.

02:10:41.980 --> 02:10:45.580
So I still think that like the timing sucks and everything.

02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:49.500
But then I went and I did a video explaining exactly what I'm telling you

02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:52.860
because I didn't want to be famous for the wrong reasons.

02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:57.340
Because that would be unfair because that, that was already people work

02:10:57.340 --> 02:10:58.620
and I was having like interviews.

02:10:58.620 --> 02:10:59.420
Can you come about this?

02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:00.460
That's it.

02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:03.100
I'm not going to talk about it because this is an issue.

02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:08.940
And I did, I didn't, and I, when I talked to James on the phone, I felt how sincere he was.

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:13.660
So I didn't want someone to, because of me will have that kind of attack

02:11:13.660 --> 02:11:16.860
because I know what it means to be on the other side of that kind of attack.

02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:17.820
It's terrible.

02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:20.060
And it ruins your life and it ruins your day.

02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.900
And nobody deserves to be doing that.

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.500
And I don't want to be the reason for someone else to go through that pain.

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:27.660
And you also said that you don't want to be a victim.

02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:28.940
I don't want to be.

02:11:28.940 --> 02:11:29.740
I'm doing great.

02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.940
I'm doing great.

02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:32.300
I'm selling out everywhere.

02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:35.100
I'm having a wonderful loyal audiences coming to me.

02:11:35.100 --> 02:11:37.100
Why would I be angry about the role if it's Superman?

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:41.100
Yes, it's great to be in a superhero movies, but so what, you know?

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:46.460
But you know, there's a, there's a wisdom in that even if you weren't doing great,

02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:52.780
that's a choice a lot of people can come to, which is like, do I play victim here or not?

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:53.340
It's greed.

02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:54.620
It's greed.

02:11:55.500 --> 02:11:56.860
They want more attention.

02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:58.460
They want to be more into the thing.

02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.660
They want more and more.

02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:04.220
And there is so much to go around to be enough for all of us, but it is greed.

02:12:04.860 --> 02:12:08.940
It is ego, ego, ego, ego.

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:09.980
I need to be in the center.

02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.020
I need to be victimized.

02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:14.300
I need to be people feel sorry for me and love me.

02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:16.620
And it is not the right way.

02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:18.060
It is not because it is fake.

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:19.500
It is fake.

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:20.140
It's made up.

02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:23.500
And I did not victimize myself when I left Egypt.

02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:26.380
I mean, in the time that I was, now I speak about it now.

02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:30.460
But in that dark times, I was detained in airports.

02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:33.020
I didn't have my American passport yet.

02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:36.620
I was still traveling with my Egyptian passport and I was detained in an Arab airport.

02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:38.380
I was going to be delivered to the Egyptians.

02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:41.020
I had shows when I was still starting.

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:47.020
I had hecklers being sent to me by the Egyptian embassy and Egyptian council in New York and

02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:52.780
in London to curse me and to take videos of that and then send it to state-run media in Egypt.

02:12:53.740 --> 02:12:57.340
And I didn't speak about that because I felt that like if I speak about that,

02:12:57.340 --> 02:13:00.060
I feel about like what was going on to me, I would be victimizing myself.

02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:02.620
It's like if I'm going to be good, I'm going to be good because of what I do,

02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:05.500
not because of what people's perception of what I'm going through.

02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:06.860
Yeah.

02:13:06.860 --> 02:13:10.620
And that becomes a slippery slope and somehow victimizing yourself.

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:12.220
Goes to more victimizing.

02:13:12.220 --> 02:13:12.780
Yeah.

02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:14.460
And then you cannot leave that habit.

02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.300
You can only exist and thrive if people feel sorry for you.

02:13:18.380 --> 02:13:18.780
Yeah.

02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:23.420
I mean, Israel and Palestine currently both have that temptation.

02:13:25.180 --> 02:13:29.900
I would always push back when you do the comparison because one of them is not

02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:31.820
really in the same kind of power.

02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:32.700
I mean, yeah.

02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:33.180
For sure.

02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:37.180
I mean, it's very easy to say why Palestinians will victimize themselves,

02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:41.500
but Israel with all of that military might, man, it's too much.

02:13:42.220 --> 02:13:45.340
What Israel is doing is that they're victimizing the Jewish experience.

02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:50.540
And I don't think it is fair for a lot of Jews.

02:13:51.340 --> 02:13:55.900
I don't think that they should use the Holocaust and the persecution that happened

02:13:55.900 --> 02:14:01.100
to Jewish people all through history in order to push an equally oppressive agenda.

02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:05.020
That is not fair and it's not good for the Jewish people living.

02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:09.100
And it is basically a disrespect to the memory of the Holocaust.

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:12.620
I told you I want to make a movie about the Holocaust.

02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:13.900
I do.

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:17.100
Because what happened was that kind of engineered torture

02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:19.820
should never happen again and it should not be happening now.

02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:23.340
So to you, what Israel is doing is leading to more anti-Semitism in the world.

02:14:23.340 --> 02:14:23.660
100%.

02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:27.820
And I think, and can I be a conspiracy theorist for a second?

02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:28.300
Please.

02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:29.100
The earth is flat.

02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:29.660
We all know this.

02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:33.660
A part of me thinking maybe they are doing that intentionally

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:37.660
because if there's a rise of anti-Semitism in Jews, there are always points like,

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:39.820
see, they hate us so we can do whatever we want.

02:14:40.780 --> 02:14:47.740
Because you see, if we let go of our might and our strength,

02:14:47.740 --> 02:14:49.740
we're going to go back to the concentration camps

02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:51.660
because you see how the world hates you.

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.820
And again, when you say they, are people in power.

02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:56.300
Yeah.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:57.100
Oh yeah, absolutely.

02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:59.100
Listen, it's always the people in power.

02:14:59.100 --> 02:15:03.260
I believe that humans are easily corruptible and easily repairable,

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.820
but the corruptive part is much easier.

02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:13.660
But people could change, but power, people in power are very dangerous,

02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.220
very, very dangerous, especially if you have religion,

02:15:18.220 --> 02:15:22.620
which is power by itself, military might, political support, and money.

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:28.300
Dude, that's a very, very, very dangerous recipe.

02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:31.500
All that said, I do believe in the power of the little guy,

02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:33.340
the individual to overthrow the government.

02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:37.260
I don't know if you heard, but the Arab Spring happens.

02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:42.060
But okay, we're here.

02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:42.780
Just among friends.

02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.220
We're Americans, right?

02:15:44.220 --> 02:15:44.860
We're Americans.

02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:47.820
We're Americans.

02:15:50.380 --> 02:15:51.260
How funny is that?

02:15:51.260 --> 02:15:52.700
Like, just giving our two backgrounds.

02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:55.340
We're Americans.

02:15:55.340 --> 02:15:59.500
It's like, we're Americans.

02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:04.860
There's one thing about the power of the little guy that I am very sad about,

02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.700
because you see, I love America, by the way.

02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:14.140
I consider it my new home, and I want my kids to grow up here.

02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:18.700
I'm very grateful for the opportunity that I have in the United States,

02:16:18.700 --> 02:16:22.860
and I criticize the United States politics, and I criticize it out of love,

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:26.540
the same way that I was criticizing what's happening with Egypt out of love.

02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:32.540
What is worrying for me is how the power of the little man is diminishing.

02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:37.340
It doesn't matter now who do you vote into power.

02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:39.340
They will not listen to you.

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:41.740
They would listen to the people who paid them to be there.

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:46.940
And it is very concerning, because I can see the American democracies turning

02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:49.740
not even slowly, very rapidly into an oligarchy.

02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:54.140
I'm sure that all of the millions of people who are voting,

02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:56.540
they don't vote for the NRA.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:58.940
They don't vote for APAC.

02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:01.740
They don't vote for the pharmaceutical companies.

02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.940
They don't vote for the military industry complex.

02:17:04.940 --> 02:17:10.940
And yet, the people in power, they come in, they take your vote and my vote,

02:17:10.940 --> 02:17:13.740
and they are loyal to those people, not to us.

02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:20.140
And it is very, very, very concerning, very concerning.

02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:27.340
And this is the danger on the American policies, American politics, and American democracies.

02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:31.340
It is dangerous because basically, the vote becomes just like a ceremony

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:40.140
that someone with the more funding will get to power, and then he's not loyal to you.

02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:46.940
So the fire, I mean, we are in Texas, and everybody is armed to the teeth here.

02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:49.340
Yeah, but what are these arms going to do in front of tanks?

02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:55.580
Well, you said the American military is unique in this way.

02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:57.740
I know, but for now.

02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:59.260
For now, the tanks are.

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:03.340
First of all, I believe Russia has more tanks than the United States.

02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:04.060
Tanks, I don't know.

02:18:05.020 --> 02:18:09.660
I'm not an expert in military strategic deployment of arms,

02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:13.100
but the United States uses different kinds of weapons.

02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:15.340
They have drones, and they have the lasers,

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:17.900
and they're sitting comfortably behind the screens.

02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:20.300
It's kind of like a big Xbox game.

02:18:20.300 --> 02:18:24.700
Yeah, and they sell a lot of those things to everybody.

02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:30.860
It's crazy because the defense budget is 68% of American military.

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:33.500
It's like almost $850 billion each year.

02:18:34.700 --> 02:18:37.980
And most of that weapons, we don't even need it.

02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:41.020
We just do it because of the contracts.

02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:44.700
There was like an incredible 60 minutes, I'm sure that you saw it,

02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:48.060
the gouging of the prices of the Department of Defense.

02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:50.620
It was one of the most fascinating things that I've ever seen.

02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:55.500
They say like a safety oil valve that used to be sold for $329.

02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:57.660
Now it is sold for $9,000.

02:18:58.620 --> 02:18:58.940
Why?

02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:04.460
Because there's only five weapon companies, and they control the prices.

02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:10.620
And in 2006, the whole Apache fleet of the American army in Iraq was grounded

02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:13.260
because there was one valve that they were like gouging the price

02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:14.540
and didn't want to give them.

02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:20.540
The Stinger missile, just like the missile, the one that you carry,

02:19:20.540 --> 02:19:22.300
and it's like the anti-aircraft.

02:19:23.100 --> 02:19:24.860
It used to be sold for $25,000.

02:19:24.860 --> 02:19:26.060
Now it's sold for $400,000.

02:19:27.180 --> 02:19:32.940
And nobody is doing that because the DOD has fired 130,000 people,

02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:34.700
including engineers and negotiators.

02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:39.020
So now, in order to cut expenses, now we're paying more money.

02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:41.740
And the thing is, we do not have a say in this.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:46.220
We do not have a say in how my tax money and your tax money is being spent.

02:19:46.940 --> 02:19:49.740
Because I'm sure you don't want your money to be sent to Israel like that.

02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:50.460
I'm sure.

02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:51.580
Even if you're Jews, I'm sure.

02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:54.460
I'm sure that I don't want my money to be given to some Muslim countries

02:19:54.460 --> 02:19:55.660
who kill other Muslims.

02:19:55.660 --> 02:19:56.220
I'm sure.

02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:59.980
But here's the thing.

02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:02.540
What kind of power do we have other than speaking?

02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:05.420
So what is left for us is free speech.

02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.500
And now when you speak, they call you anti-Semitic.

02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:09.340
You see why I'm angry?

02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:15.820
But still, I mean, America's holding pretty strong despite the criticisms on the free

02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:16.460
speech front.

02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:21.020
But if you look at the freedom of the press, freedom of the speech index,

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:23.660
America is not at the top.

02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:24.620
It is not.

02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:28.860
And this is why, for example, it is very disheartening for me to see

02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:34.140
that the Western media, Western press that used to be the beacon of freedom,

02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:36.300
are now using it as mouthpieces.

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:39.500
And it is funny how the New York Times,

02:20:40.780 --> 02:20:43.260
Nixon got angry in the New York Times in 1971

02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:48.860
when they found leaks about him lying about the Vietnam War since the beginning.

02:20:49.740 --> 02:20:55.020
And now he hired the plumbers, the special units in order to go in and find the leaks.

02:20:55.020 --> 02:20:58.940
This was Watergate, basically, because he was angry to see who leaked that

02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:01.100
instead of fixing the problem.

02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:05.740
Now the New York Times have published this story about the rape that was a hoax,

02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:08.460
that was written by Anna Schwartz, with someone who had no experience.

02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:14.700
And now, when it was leaked, instead of them correcting themselves,

02:21:14.700 --> 02:21:17.740
they went in and they had their own investigation to see who leaked.

02:21:17.740 --> 02:21:22.060
The New York Times in 2003 became the mouthpiece for George W. Bush of the WMD.

02:21:22.060 --> 02:21:25.820
And now, as an American, I see that the New York Times is becoming a mouthpiece of a foreign

02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:26.140
country.

02:21:26.860 --> 02:21:27.660
Why do you do that?

02:21:28.220 --> 02:21:31.980
One of the things that's really difficult to know is where to find the truth.

02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:38.460
It does seem that both sides use propaganda and both sides lie a lot.

02:21:40.140 --> 02:21:41.420
Both sides, as in?

02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:43.820
Both, Israel and Palestine, pro-Palestine, pro-Israel.

02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:44.860
There's a lot of lies.

02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:49.660
I know, but it's a lot of inequality, man.

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:55.740
Are you like, there's like a lot of people on the internet, but like who have the mainstream

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.180
media siding with?

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:00.220
Yeah, but, you know, thanks to social media.

02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:03.660
Yes, thank God for social media because now it's individuals.

02:22:03.660 --> 02:22:05.660
There are people, there are people.

02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:10.860
You're comparing BBC, New York Times, Washington Post, World Street Journal,

02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:12.940
with just people with a TikTok account.

02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:15.100
Yeah, who has more power in your view?

02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:19.980
Now, it is actually very, very fascinating to see the little man having that power over

02:22:19.980 --> 02:22:20.540
the media.

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:21.900
In fact, disproportionately so.

02:22:23.420 --> 02:22:24.380
This is my problem.

02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:30.060
But you cannot call people with TikTok propagandists while people being paid to give you the news

02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:31.820
and they deliberately lie to you.

02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:32.460
Yes, I can.

02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:33.580
They're both propagandists.

02:22:35.660 --> 02:22:42.060
Yes, yes, but like, but the mechanism and the intentions are different because here's

02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:42.460
the thing.

02:22:42.460 --> 02:22:44.460
I'd rather have the TikTok guy than the...

02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.420
If like the TikTok guy is a TikTok guy, all right?

02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:53.100
But if you have the New York Times being told that they're being exposed to be lying

02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:58.780
and then they get this like UN report, which is like a disgrace and you just put the title

02:22:58.780 --> 02:22:59.660
and you don't talk about it.

02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:05.580
I'm fine with CNN and Jake Tapper and all of those people, like spreading the rape

02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:06.620
allegations for years.

02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:07.180
They didn't...

02:23:07.180 --> 02:23:08.860
I don't even want them to refute them.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:12.620
I want them to bring the Israeli reports saying that it didn't happen.

02:23:13.260 --> 02:23:15.900
The Israeli media themselves, they didn't even bother.

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:16.460
Not once.

02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:18.380
Is that balanced?

02:23:18.380 --> 02:23:19.340
That's not.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:23.500
So that's why people in TikTok and because they have to take matters in their own hand.

02:23:23.500 --> 02:23:28.940
Yeah, but the problem with the people in TikTok is the drug, the dopamine rush of getting

02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:30.220
a lot of likes.

02:23:30.220 --> 02:23:34.220
So instead of talking about the death of civilians, they'll talk about beheaded babies

02:23:34.220 --> 02:23:39.980
or the equivalent of they're going to actually make up stories because the made up stories

02:23:39.980 --> 02:23:41.660
are going to be more viral.

02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:44.860
And so now we're just in the sea in this muck of lies.

02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:47.820
And there's a lot of people who actually exposed those lies on TikTok.

02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:48.700
So you have both.

02:23:49.420 --> 02:23:50.060
You have both.

02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:53.260
And it's kind of like the democracy of the social media, as we always call it.

02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:58.380
But if you have the street run media, that is the legacy media, CNN, BBC, New York Times,

02:23:58.380 --> 02:23:59.980
Fuck News, all of those people.

02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:05.020
And they are like spreading lies and they're not even doing their journalistic job in order

02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:06.780
to at least bring the other side.

02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:07.100
Yeah.

02:24:07.100 --> 02:24:08.220
That's problematic.

02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:09.740
And that's worse.

02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:11.260
You're supposed to be journalists.

02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:11.760
Yes.

02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.740
It's supposed to be a report.

02:24:14.380 --> 02:24:14.860
Report.

02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:22.780
Yeah, but I see that this is like a catalyst and inspiration for the citizen journalists

02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:23.980
to rise up.

02:24:23.980 --> 02:24:24.780
This is what you're doing.

02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:25.740
This?

02:24:25.740 --> 02:24:26.220
Yeah.

02:24:26.220 --> 02:24:27.180
This is what you're doing.

02:24:27.180 --> 02:24:29.580
No, this is what you're doing because you go into the deep dive.

02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.580
This is like a no filter thing.

02:24:31.580 --> 02:24:32.620
There's no spin.

02:24:32.620 --> 02:24:33.980
The long form.

02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:35.180
Long form is going to save us.

02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:39.020
I see why you hate the TikToks.

02:24:39.020 --> 02:24:40.300
Like a dopamine rush, you know?

02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:41.740
Stupid TikTok.

02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:44.460
I saw the resentment in your face.

02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:47.900
But I can't look away.

02:24:47.900 --> 02:24:50.780
For like those 30 seconds, I do four hours.

02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:54.140
I mean, both have a place.

02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:54.940
Both are exciting.

02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:57.180
But I can't.

02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:59.980
It is very dangerous because you can't look away.

02:24:59.980 --> 02:25:06.460
And I almost never, maybe I'm doing it wrong, but I almost never feel better ever

02:25:06.460 --> 02:25:08.380
after having used TikTok.

02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:09.260
Makes two of us.

02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:09.980
I can't.

02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:10.700
I cannot.

02:25:10.700 --> 02:25:11.180
I cannot.

02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:11.980
I have a team.

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:15.580
By the way, I give my password to like a team.

02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:23.500
I don't even go there because I went once in a dark night, very late at night, I went TikTok.

02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:26.140
And it was like two hours.

02:25:26.140 --> 02:25:26.700
What?

02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:27.020
Yeah.

02:25:27.740 --> 02:25:28.060
What?

02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:29.900
I said, no, no, no, no.

02:25:29.900 --> 02:25:30.300
No, no, no.

02:25:30.300 --> 02:25:31.260
This is dangerous.

02:25:31.260 --> 02:25:33.660
I'm already like an Instagram and Facebook guy.

02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:35.740
I don't need that.

02:25:35.740 --> 02:25:36.700
But even there, man.

02:25:36.700 --> 02:25:37.980
And I barely get out of Twitter.

02:25:37.980 --> 02:25:39.100
I mean, like X, I don't.

02:25:39.100 --> 02:25:39.500
I can't.

02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:41.260
X is a cesspool.

02:25:41.260 --> 02:25:41.820
X.

02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:44.460
It's just like the concentrated hate.

02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:45.660
And X is too much.

02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:46.220
It's too much.

02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:46.860
I can't.

02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:48.220
So you don't check it at all?

02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:49.420
You try not to check it at all?

02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:50.460
It is very intense.

02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:50.780
I don't.

02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:51.100
I don't.

02:25:51.100 --> 02:25:51.660
I don't.

02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:51.980
I can't.

02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:52.540
I can't.

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:54.460
I just like, I post something and I run.

02:25:56.940 --> 02:25:57.660
Post and ghost.

02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:02.540
So you're doing comedy here in the United States right now.

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:02.940
Yes.

02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:07.020
Joe Rogan has the comedy Mothership, which is an incredible club.

02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:08.860
Have you considered doing that club?

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:09.580
I would love to.

02:26:09.580 --> 02:26:10.620
I mean, I...

02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:11.420
Do you know Joe?

02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:12.060
Of course, no.

02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:13.740
Who doesn't know Joe?

02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:15.660
I feel like it's a small world of comedy.

02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:16.620
That's why I...

02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:21.260
No, I think like Joe's story was like what he did and

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:25.340
stuff that he did in the EUFC and his podcast.

02:26:25.340 --> 02:26:28.460
And it just, it's very impressive.

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:32.380
The fact that he is there and he is bringing all of those people,

02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:34.620
whether in comedy or his podcast is very impressive.

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:38.060
And this is what the media is all about.

02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:39.740
What is like the internet is all about.

02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:42.700
To give you the experiences of stuff that you might never experience.

02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:45.340
And that is very important.

02:26:45.340 --> 02:26:47.980
I mean, you do it with people where like you go into their brains.

02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:52.780
He goes take people and they take their experiences and their lives and their stories.

02:26:52.780 --> 02:26:54.220
It is very interesting.

02:26:54.220 --> 02:26:57.740
And this is the beauty of that art form because

02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:03.820
you have all of these experiences at the tips of your hands and it is there for you to learn from.

02:27:04.540 --> 02:27:10.060
You know, and what he's doing like when he moved to Texas and we did the comedy Mothership,

02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:14.060
anybody who would like push comedy forward,

02:27:15.020 --> 02:27:17.820
that is the most difficult art form and the most demanding.

02:27:17.980 --> 02:27:19.660
And the fact that you do that,

02:27:19.660 --> 02:27:21.660
and he might not even be making money out of it,

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:23.500
but he's doing that because of his passion.

02:27:23.500 --> 02:27:24.460
That is enough.

02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:28.140
Yeah, he really believes in creating this like

02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:31.660
place where comedians can be really free.

02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:36.780
And one of the cool things about the comedy Mothership is like comedian is king there.

02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:41.500
Yeah, like there we have to like you have to bow down to the.

02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:44.780
Because you know, the comedian who came there came after like eating shit.

02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:46.860
Yeah, dying out there everywhere else.

02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:48.940
You have basically, you're a saint.

02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:52.300
I have eaten shit for many years.

02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:55.820
Now I'm going to give you shit.

02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:58.220
Ah, it's great.

02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:01.820
You already told me what you think about the state of politics in the United States,

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:03.660
but now tell me what you really think.

02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:07.900
What do you think of the choice of Trump versus Biden?

02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:08.780
How do we end up here?

02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:09.500
I don't know, man.

02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:13.180
I mean, like the fact that like you have two people over the age of 90.

02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:13.580
Yeah.

02:28:13.580 --> 02:28:14.220
It is.

02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:15.900
I think it's over 100, but that's all right.

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:18.060
Combined like 170.

02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:20.380
It is so sad.

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:24.300
It is so sad that this is what we can produce as a society.

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:31.020
Like, like a demagogue and a sleepy Joe.

02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:33.740
I guess he's too, he's not there, man.

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:35.340
He's gone.

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:35.820
He's gone.

02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:43.660
I mean, he could, you know, like when old people could be like a danger for themselves,

02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:45.100
he's a danger for the whole world.

02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:49.980
I mean, like the whole world, like if an old person would die,

02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:52.220
he would like, you know, have like a hip replacement.

02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:55.580
We can need a new planet because of one decision.

02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:57.340
But it's not just that.

02:28:57.340 --> 02:28:57.980
It's not that.

02:28:57.980 --> 02:29:04.140
It's what are, when I came here, listen, I'm a Democrat.

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:07.420
I always like, and I told you, like I vote for Bernie Sanders.

02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:13.660
I like, I supported him like 2016, but I couldn't vote then.

02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:15.580
And of course, a huge fan of Obama.

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:20.700
And one of my friends, he's like, he's the first Muslim president,

02:29:20.700 --> 02:29:21.500
but he killed Muslims.

02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:22.700
Like, ah, that's the things Muslims do.

02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:25.420
But anyways, I love that one.

02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:35.260
And it just, I think the whole idea, like my shock is,

02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:40.060
I told you about like what Biden said about like, I'm a Zionist.

02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:41.020
Okay, we are Zionists.

02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.780
But then like Jews are not safe in anywhere.

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:44.460
Dude, what the hell are you saying?

02:29:45.980 --> 02:29:48.860
And if you don't care about me and you don't care about my misery,

02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:53.340
why would I care about you winning or losing, you know?

02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:59.100
And I have a joke that I told people, like, why would even Biden listen to us?

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:05.740
He just raised $145 million in California alone from pro-Israeli groups.

02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:11.100
I mean, what can we Arabs working in the vape business do to him?

02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:14.380
Yeah.

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:16.060
It's like we cannot compete with that.

02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:19.420
I mean, like practically, I mean, it's like life is like, life is unfair.

02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:21.180
The guy is a politician.

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:22.300
He needs bills to pay.

02:30:22.300 --> 02:30:23.820
He needs a campaign to run.

02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:25.020
He needs money.

02:30:25.020 --> 02:30:26.700
He will go to the people who will give him money.

02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:31.500
Joe Biden is the highest paid politician from Israeli lobby.

02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:35.020
It's $4.6 million over the years.

02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:39.340
Yeah, but I also believe in great leaders that go against all of that.

02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:42.380
But unfortunately, you know, Bernie Sanders was like that.

02:30:42.780 --> 02:30:47.020
Bernie Sanders, yes, but also age.

02:30:47.020 --> 02:30:48.140
I don't want to be ageist.

02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:49.020
Of course, no, no.

02:30:49.020 --> 02:30:55.180
Even with like, because I remember listening to Bernie Sanders 20 years ago on Tom Hartman's show

02:30:55.820 --> 02:31:00.540
and I don't want to say anything against Bernie, but like he was sharper then.

02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:01.020
Of course.

02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:02.300
There's a thing with age.

02:31:02.300 --> 02:31:02.940
Yeah, of course.

02:31:02.940 --> 02:31:08.700
Now, I think I'm a huge fan about like putting a limit on your working years

02:31:08.700 --> 02:31:11.420
because you don't want to have like a Mitch McConnell moment every now,

02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:13.420
because now the whole thing is like, what is this?

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:16.540
It's not like a house by scare home.

02:31:16.540 --> 02:31:18.780
It's just, it is unfair.

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:19.580
It is unfair.

02:31:19.580 --> 02:31:21.660
And that the whole idea that you have like unlimited,

02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:23.180
like you have a limit for the president,

02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:25.740
but you don't have a limit for Congress people and senators.

02:31:25.740 --> 02:31:26.460
That's what you mean.

02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:31.580
This is basically, you can go in and be in governance forever.

02:31:31.580 --> 02:31:35.020
And you know, the longer that you can get, the more corrupt you will get.

02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:38.860
Yes, and that is very concerning for Americans.

02:31:38.860 --> 02:31:41.420
Everybody, everybody becomes corrupt after.

02:31:41.420 --> 02:31:44.300
I mean, that's why two terms is a good limit.

02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:45.260
For everybody.

02:31:45.260 --> 02:31:45.740
Yeah.

02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:49.980
And you know, maybe half a term for Egyptian leaders.

02:31:51.100 --> 02:31:53.260
Well, you know, our half term is 15 years.

02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:55.660
Quarter term.

02:31:58.220 --> 02:32:00.940
You should come back and run for office there.

02:32:00.940 --> 02:32:02.140
Oh my God.

02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:07.660
No, no, there's a curse in Egyptian presidency.

02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:10.780
Nobody, nobody comes there like he's like dead or in jail.

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:11.340
Yeah.

02:32:11.340 --> 02:32:13.660
It's not the most appealing job.

02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.340
They might make a statue of you though.

02:32:15.340 --> 02:32:16.380
Make you look good.

02:32:16.380 --> 02:32:17.100
After my death.

02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:20.860
I look very good dead.

02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:24.140
Yeah.

02:32:24.140 --> 02:32:27.660
When you look at what happened with Navalny,

02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:33.660
since you kind of really thought about this in Egypt,

02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:36.460
what happened with Navalny in Russia?

02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:38.780
What do you think about that?

02:32:38.780 --> 02:32:41.740
Yeah, but what happened in Navalny in Russia is not something new in Russia.

02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:45.420
I mean, Putin have like this whole history of poisoning and killing people.

02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:51.020
And it's kind of like pretty much, I would have to cite credit Putin.

02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:54.220
He's like bringing us the essence of the dark ages, the middle ages.

02:32:54.220 --> 02:32:58.060
It's like, you know, we know like basically Putin is like,

02:32:58.060 --> 02:33:01.500
is the living example of what happens if Game of Thrones was reality.

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:04.540
It's like death by poison.

02:33:05.340 --> 02:33:06.940
Like a blow up a plane.

02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:08.700
It's like mysteriously disappears.

02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:14.860
It is very dark, but it's like, wow.

02:33:18.540 --> 02:33:20.140
It's a television show.

02:33:20.140 --> 02:33:22.940
Maybe that's what attracts us to that part of the world

02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:31.580
is that it's so much on display, this game of power, of geopolitics, of war.

02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:34.220
No, but the same happens in the West, but I'm behind closed doors.

02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:35.020
It's not that open.

02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:37.900
It's not that pronounced, you know.

02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:40.460
It's like, oops, Epstein.

02:33:44.060 --> 02:33:49.100
It's like, we just like, I think because of the West is more advanced,

02:33:49.100 --> 02:33:51.580
like in movies and cinemas, we kind of direct it better.

02:33:52.700 --> 02:33:55.980
I think the outcomes, like the way that you kind of like said the scene is like,

02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:57.980
scene and scene.

02:33:57.980 --> 02:33:59.980
That's why people are all like landing on the moon.

02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:06.140
They're like, I get it, but we haven't gone back.

02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:12.860
All right.

02:34:12.860 --> 02:34:18.700
If we zoom out, do you think there will always be war in the world, always be suffering?

02:34:18.700 --> 02:34:19.200
Yes.

02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:21.500
But here's the thing.

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:22.460
I don't think for long.

02:34:23.180 --> 02:34:24.460
I don't think that will happen for them.

02:34:25.020 --> 02:34:25.740
Wait a minute.

02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:27.660
Yeah, because here's the thing.

02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:34.460
I think humanity is destined to have war, especially it will have war, but something

02:34:34.460 --> 02:34:35.820
happened in the last 50 years.

02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:40.700
Now we have much more lethal weapons.

02:34:41.340 --> 02:34:45.980
The problem is, in the beginning, it's like swords against swords, horses, cavalry,

02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:49.260
like cannons, catapults, mini-missiles, cheeky, cheeky, cheeky.

02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:53.420
But now, like a press of a button, you can annihilate the whole planet.

02:34:54.140 --> 02:34:55.660
And this is the problem.

02:34:55.660 --> 02:34:56.780
Wars will all continue.

02:34:56.780 --> 02:35:01.020
The problem is when it's going to be the tipping point where we are actually going

02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:02.540
to destroy ourselves.

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:04.780
And it is so easy now to destroy ourselves.

02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:10.380
The amount of weapons and the quality of weapons that we have, it is designed to kill more

02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:14.220
effectively, it is crazy.

02:35:14.220 --> 02:35:16.700
It's like we can create our own destruction on ourselves.

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:19.180
And I think we're not that far away from it.

02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:24.060
Just looking at nuclear weapons, the fascinating thing about nuclear weapons that I've gotten

02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:34.140
to learn recently, just how few people are involved in a full-on nuclear war that basically

02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:35.420
kills everybody.

02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:39.580
Well, three plus billion people right away.

02:35:39.580 --> 02:35:44.780
And the consequences of the nuclear winter, it's unlivable.

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:48.860
But all it takes is, I mean, one president can do it.

02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:52.300
So it could be even a false alarm, misunderstanding.

02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:55.180
Like what happened in the Cuba Missile Crisis.

02:35:55.740 --> 02:36:04.140
But again, and now there's more nations are prepared and ready to launch.

02:36:04.140 --> 02:36:11.340
Yeah, and you have a media and a 24-hours kind of thing that makes you at edge the whole

02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:11.660
time.

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:12.460
That's crazy.

02:36:13.180 --> 02:36:18.940
There's a dark perspective on this where there's certain members of the media that would kind of

02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:21.980
enjoy the prospect of nuclear war.

02:36:21.980 --> 02:36:26.140
Like a little bit, just let's get as close to it as possible.

02:36:26.140 --> 02:36:29.900
You have another factor that will contribute to that.

02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:32.300
Religion.

02:36:34.380 --> 02:36:39.740
And remember how like the radical Islamists talk about like the end of time and whatever,

02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:42.220
but like most of the Islamists don't have that much power.

02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:45.500
Problem is with Christian Zionists now being on the top of the world with America.

02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:50.060
They have been pushing for that kind of conflict to kind of escalate, escalate.

02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:51.260
Listen to Sarah Palin.

02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:53.100
It's like God wants us here.

02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:59.580
Like Karl Rove, all of the new gods, the dispensationalist Reagan.

02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:02.140
There's an incredible book called like Forcing the Hands of Gods.

02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.260
Oh, beautiful book.

02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:07.100
I read it's like it's published 1998, but it still matters today.

02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:11.820
The whole idea of what like, especially the Zionist Christians who love Israel,

02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:13.020
but they hate the Jews.

02:37:13.020 --> 02:37:16.140
They're anti-Semite, but they love Israel because of its role.

02:37:16.140 --> 02:37:20.460
This is all basically formed because of the interpretation of the Bible of Schofield

02:37:20.460 --> 02:37:25.020
and how they talk about the end of time, the Armageddon and then the late great planet Earth

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.180
and then left behind Sirius and all of that.

02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:30.220
It's all about like we're heading to Armageddon.

02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:34.300
The problem is Islam has the people that believe that the end of time.

02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.380
And then we have the Christians that believe in the end of time.

02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:40.140
And then you have Israel happy that those people are using it for the end of time.

02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:46.140
And then the whole idea about them pushing as many weapons and troops and people in the Middle East

02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:48.780
to be there for the nuclear Holocaust.

02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:51.740
And John Hagee, one of the pastors talk about that,

02:37:51.740 --> 02:37:54.460
about the brimstone and it's not going to be a nuclear Holocaust.

02:37:56.460 --> 02:38:00.780
It's crazy how people are so despising life that they are wanting death.

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:06.060
So now you all would have these revelations, but these revelations mean nothing if you

02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:08.300
don't have an effective weapon in order to make it happen.

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:10.540
And this is the crazy thing.

02:38:10.540 --> 02:38:16.140
And I'm worried that the end is going to be by someone that wants to meet God a little bit earlier.

02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:21.820
Somebody who's really in a hurry.

02:38:23.660 --> 02:38:25.500
Well, I have good news for you.

02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:28.540
Maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species.

02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:32.700
Maybe Elon Musk will lead us the way to get out in space.

02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:33.660
Maybe he's one of them.

02:38:39.260 --> 02:38:42.700
I asked you offline to not mention the lizard people.

02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:47.180
There's like a whole people that believe in the lizard people.

02:38:47.180 --> 02:38:47.820
It's crazy.

02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:48.860
I actually have to be honest.

02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.940
I haven't fully looked into the lizard people.

02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:51.740
I probably should.

02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:52.540
You should.

02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:53.020
Yeah.

02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:55.100
Well, maybe I'm afraid of the truth.

02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:04.860
Removing my face.

02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:16.300
I mean, so let's say you're wrong about the end of the world and it all turns out great

02:39:16.300 --> 02:39:17.740
and humanity flourishes.

02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:20.300
Why would that happen?

02:39:20.300 --> 02:39:25.340
What gives you hope for that trajectory for humanity?

02:39:26.460 --> 02:39:27.100
Younger people.

02:39:28.460 --> 02:39:29.820
The people of TikTok that you don't like.

02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:35.100
Yeah, there is a lot of bullshit there.

02:39:36.220 --> 02:39:39.500
After you saying this, people just keep sending you TikTok videos.

02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:40.380
These younger people.

02:39:43.260 --> 02:39:44.700
This woman showing her boobs.

02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:45.660
That woman.

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:46.460
That's going to save us.

02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:49.100
All right, awesome.

02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:49.580
Thank you.

02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:56.860
I think there is a wealth of it.

02:39:56.940 --> 02:40:01.100
Remember the joke that said we thought that when we have internet, we're going to be more

02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:07.180
informed and now we're watching twerking videos and that is true.

02:40:07.180 --> 02:40:12.300
But on the other side, the fact that you have the availability of information.

02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:18.220
I'm learning a lot and there's people who are using that platform.

02:40:18.220 --> 02:40:22.300
It's not the majority because it's not very interesting and exciting.

02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:27.980
But I think there might be a tipping point where there's enough people that will be aware

02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:35.660
and maybe they would collectively do something in order to bring back the power to the small man.

02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:36.940
Maybe it sounds very naive.

02:40:38.300 --> 02:40:39.260
But we don't know.

02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:46.700
We don't know because you have already seen the legacy media and the legacy politicians shaking

02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:48.220
in the past few months.

02:40:48.220 --> 02:40:49.260
They're getting nervous.

02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.580
They're getting nervous because people are calling them out

02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:55.260
and those people were like hiding behind their desk, behind in their offices and not holding

02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:55.820
accounts for that.

02:40:55.820 --> 02:41:00.220
But people now are calling them out and it is not going to happen like this year or next year.

02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:01.900
But I think it's something.

02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:03.740
What advice would you give to those young folks?

02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:05.180
I will never give advice to those people.

02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:08.460
Get off TikTok.

02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:11.740
I will never because their input is different than mine.

02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:14.780
There's one thing I learned when people saw me.

02:41:14.780 --> 02:41:16.620
Did the revolution fail in Egypt?

02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:19.740
Did people that the people are like, listen, the revolution is not an event.

02:41:19.740 --> 02:41:21.500
It's not like, hey, we go in, we topple the government.

02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:22.220
It's not a revolution.

02:41:22.220 --> 02:41:23.820
A revolution is a process.

02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:25.340
It's a very long process.

02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:30.300
And maybe that process, I mean, as much as we don't like what happened in the Arab world,

02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:34.220
but the people there, the awareness of what happened and the discussions that have been

02:41:34.220 --> 02:41:38.620
opened that you didn't even imagine what happened in the Middle East is happening.

02:41:39.180 --> 02:41:46.140
And maybe the beginning of any hope of change is that people start talking, speaking out,

02:41:46.940 --> 02:41:50.140
talking about stuff they were not allowed to speak about.

02:41:50.140 --> 02:41:51.740
Like, for example, Israel.

02:41:54.140 --> 02:41:55.580
The revolution continues.

02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:00.220
Basim, you're a beautiful human being.

02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:02.460
It's truly a pleasure and honor to meet you.

02:42:02.460 --> 02:42:05.020
I could just feel the love radiating from you.

02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:07.820
I hope I get to see you perform live.

02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:10.060
I hope to get to see you many more times.

02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:11.580
Thank you for being who you are.

02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.380
Thank you so much.

02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:14.300
And I would love to invite you for my new special.

02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:20.940
That should be the title of your autobiography.

02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:21.980
Thank you so much.

02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:22.620
Thank you, brother.

02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:51.660
Use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows

02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:54.860
on the sudden unexpected dangerous flaming ant epidemic.

02:42:56.140 --> 02:42:59.900
If we amplify everything, we hear nothing.

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:04.380
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
