00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
Why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion

00:02.320 --> 00:05.400
and new materials and new methods of heat extraction

00:05.400 --> 00:07.500
and so forth because everybody knew fusion

00:07.500 --> 00:11.040
was 40 years away and now it's four years away.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.960
The following is a conversation with Dennis White,

00:15.960 --> 00:18.840
nuclear physicist at MIT and the director

00:18.840 --> 00:22.280
of the MIT Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.360
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.120
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:26.120 --> 00:27.560
in the description.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.200
And now, dear friends, here's Dennis White.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.780
Let's start with a big question.

00:33.780 --> 00:35.320
What is nuclear fusion?

00:35.320 --> 00:38.600
It's the underlying process that powers the universe.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.640
So as the name implies, it fuses together

00:41.640 --> 00:46.120
or brings together two different elements,

00:46.120 --> 00:49.080
technically nuclei, that come together.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.880
And if you can push them together close enough

00:51.880 --> 00:55.000
that you can trigger essentially a reaction,

00:55.040 --> 00:59.000
what happens is that the element typically changes.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
So this means that you change from one element

01:01.000 --> 01:03.200
to another, the chemical element to another.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.240
Underlying what this means is that you change

01:05.240 --> 01:07.800
the nuclear structure, this rearrangement

01:07.800 --> 01:11.160
through equals MC squared releases large amounts of energy.

01:11.160 --> 01:15.360
So fusion is the fusing together of lighter elements

01:15.360 --> 01:17.180
into heavier elements.

01:17.180 --> 01:19.480
And when you go through it, you say, oh, look,

01:19.480 --> 01:23.120
so here were the initial elements, typically hydrogen,

01:23.120 --> 01:26.440
and they had a particular mass, rest mass,

01:26.440 --> 01:29.400
which means just the mass with no kinetic energy.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.560
And when you look at the product afterwards,

01:31.560 --> 01:33.360
it has less rest mass.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.160
And so you go, well, how is that possible?

01:35.160 --> 01:37.760
Because you have to keep mass, but mass and energy

01:37.760 --> 01:41.360
are the same thing, which is what equals MC squared means.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.160
And the conversion of this comes into kinetic energy,

01:45.160 --> 01:47.860
namely energy that you can use in some way.

01:47.860 --> 01:51.440
And that's what happens in the center of stars.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.360
So fusion is literally the reason

01:54.360 --> 01:57.560
life is viable in the universe.

01:57.560 --> 02:00.320
So fusion is happening in our sun.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.760
And what are the elements?

02:01.760 --> 02:05.480
The elements are hydrogen that are coming together.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.440
It goes through a process, which is probably

02:07.440 --> 02:10.920
gets a little bit too detailed, but it's

02:10.920 --> 02:14.280
a somewhat complex catalyzed process that happens

02:14.280 --> 02:16.440
in the center of stars.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.400
But in the end, stars are big balls of hydrogen,

02:19.400 --> 02:20.520
which is the lightest.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.560
That's the simplest element, the lightest element,

02:22.560 --> 02:23.600
the most abundant element.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.200
Most of the universe is hydrogen.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.520
And it's essentially a sequence through which

02:28.520 --> 02:31.720
these processes occur that you end up with helium.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.040
So those are the primary things.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.120
And the reason for this is because helium

02:36.120 --> 02:41.120
has features as a nucleus, like the interior part of the atom,

02:41.120 --> 02:43.520
that is extremely stable.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.560
And the reason for this is helium has two protons

02:46.560 --> 02:47.880
and two neutrons.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.000
These are the things that make up nuclei, that make up

02:50.000 --> 02:51.840
all of us, along with electrons.

02:51.840 --> 02:56.280
And because it has two pairs, it's extremely stable.

02:56.280 --> 03:00.200
And for this reason, when you convert the hydrogen

03:00.200 --> 03:02.480
into helium, it just wants to stay helium,

03:02.480 --> 03:04.840
and it wants to release kinetic energy.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.080
So stars are basically conversion engines

03:09.080 --> 03:11.320
of hydrogen into helium.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.240
And this also tells you why you love fusion.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.720
Because our sun will last 10 billion years, approximately.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.880
That's how long the fuel will last.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.400
But to do that kind of conversion,

03:24.400 --> 03:26.480
you have to have extremely high temperatures.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.840
It is one of the criteria for doing this.

03:28.840 --> 03:30.600
But it's the easiest one to understand.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.280
And why is this?

03:31.280 --> 03:35.560
It's because, effectively, what this requires

03:35.560 --> 03:40.360
is that these hydrogen ions, which is really

03:40.360 --> 03:42.720
the berenucleus, so they have a positive charge.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.160
Everything has a positive charge of those ones.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.840
Is that to get them to trigger this reaction,

03:47.840 --> 03:50.480
they must approach within distances

03:50.480 --> 03:52.920
which are like the size of the nucleus itself.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.880
Because the nature, in fact, what it's really using

03:55.880 --> 03:57.840
is something called the strong nuclear force.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.080
There's four fundamental forces in the universe.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.800
This is the strongest one.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.400
But it has a strange property, is

04:03.400 --> 04:06.040
that while it's the strongest force by far,

04:06.040 --> 04:08.880
it only has impact over distances, which

04:08.880 --> 04:10.400
are the size of a nucleus.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.200
So to put that into, what does that mean?

04:13.200 --> 04:17.760
It's a millionth of a billionth of a meter,

04:17.760 --> 04:19.760
incredibly small distances.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.840
But because the distances are small

04:21.840 --> 04:23.760
and the particles have charge, they

04:23.760 --> 04:25.640
want to push strongly apart.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.600
Namely, they have repulsion that wants to push them apart.

04:28.600 --> 04:31.160
So it turns out, when you go through the math of this,

04:31.160 --> 04:34.480
the average velocity or energy of the particles

04:34.480 --> 04:38.480
must be very high to have any significant probability

04:38.480 --> 04:40.240
of the reactions happening.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.080
And so the center of our sun is at about 20 million degrees

04:44.080 --> 04:46.000
Celsius.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.400
And on Earth, this means it's one of the first things

04:48.400 --> 04:52.400
we teach entering graduate students.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.640
You can do a quick basically power balance,

04:54.640 --> 04:56.680
and you can determine that on Earth,

04:56.680 --> 04:59.600
it requires a minimum temperature of about 50

04:59.600 --> 05:02.240
million degrees Celsius on Earth.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.680
To perform fusion.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.920
To get enough fusion that you would

05:06.920 --> 05:10.880
be able to get energy gain out of it.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.720
So you can trigger fusion reactions at lower energy.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.920
They become almost vanishingly small at lower temperatures

05:16.920 --> 05:18.240
than that.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.640
First of all, let me just linger on some crazy ideas.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.960
One, the strong force.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.400
Just stepping out and looking at all the physics.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.120
Is it weird to you that there's these forces

05:29.120 --> 05:30.840
and they're very particular?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.640
Like it operates at a very small distance,

05:32.640 --> 05:34.880
and then gravity operates at a very large distance,

05:35.360 --> 05:37.280
and they're all very specific.

05:37.280 --> 05:40.600
And the standard model describes three of those forces

05:40.600 --> 05:42.000
extremely well.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.400
And this is one of them.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.240
Yeah, this is one of them.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.720
And it just all kind of works out.

05:46.720 --> 05:51.360
There's a big part of you that's an engineer.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.600
Did you step back and almost look at the philosophy

05:53.600 --> 05:54.920
of physics?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.160
So it's interesting because as a scientist,

05:57.160 --> 06:00.320
I see the universe through that lens of essentially

06:00.320 --> 06:02.640
the interesting things that we do are through the forces

06:02.640 --> 06:04.880
that get used around those.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.640
And everything works because of that.

06:07.640 --> 06:09.920
Richard Feynman had, I don't know if you ever had

06:09.920 --> 06:12.200
Richard Feynman, it's a little bit of a tangent, but.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.040
He's never been on the podcast.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.320
He's never been on the podcast.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.720
He just unfortunately passed away,

06:15.720 --> 06:19.520
but one of like a hero to almost all physicists.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.800
And then part of it was because of what you said,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.200
he kind of looked through a different lens at these,

06:25.200 --> 06:27.520
what typically look like very dry,

06:27.520 --> 06:29.440
like equations and relationships.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.200
And he kind of, I think he brought out the wonder of it

06:32.200 --> 06:34.480
in some sense, right, for those.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.080
He posited what would be,

06:36.080 --> 06:38.200
if you could write down a single,

06:38.200 --> 06:41.640
not even really a sentence, but a single concept

06:41.640 --> 06:44.200
that was the most important thing scientifically

06:44.200 --> 06:46.120
that we knew about that in other words,

06:46.120 --> 06:48.560
you had only one thing that you could transmit

06:48.560 --> 06:51.440
like a future or past generation.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.280
It was very interesting.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.200
It was, so it's not what you think.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.120
It wasn't like, oh, strong nuclear force or fusion

06:57.120 --> 06:58.440
or something like this.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.840
And it's very profound, which was,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.400
he goes that the reason that matter

07:04.320 --> 07:06.920
operates the way that it does is because

07:06.920 --> 07:10.400
all matter is made up of individual particles

07:10.400 --> 07:12.880
that interact with each other through forces.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.720
That was it.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.560
So just that atomic theory, basically.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.840
Yeah.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.440
Which is like, wow, that's like so simple,

07:19.440 --> 07:20.800
but it's not so simple.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.520
It's because like who thinks about atoms

07:23.520 --> 07:24.560
that they're made out of?

07:24.560 --> 07:27.840
Like, there's a good question I give to my students.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.280
How many atoms are in your body?

07:29.280 --> 07:31.000
Like almost no students can answer this.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
But to me, that's like a fundamental thing.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
By the way, it's about 10 to the 28.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.360
10 to the 28.

07:36.360 --> 07:40.720
So that's a trillion or million, trillion, trillion

07:40.720 --> 07:41.560
or something like that, yes.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.360
So one thing is to think about the number

07:43.360 --> 07:46.520
and the other is to start to really ponder the fact.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.600
That it all holds together.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.800
Yeah, it all holds together and you're actually that.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.840
You're more that than you are anything else.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.400
Yes, exactly, yeah.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.480
No, I mean, there are people who do study such things

07:56.480 --> 07:59.080
of the fact that if you look at the,

07:59.080 --> 08:02.560
for example, the ratios between those fundamental forces,

08:02.560 --> 08:03.400
people have figured out,

08:03.400 --> 08:05.960
oh, if this ratio was different by some factor,

08:05.960 --> 08:07.320
like a factor of two or something like that,

08:07.320 --> 08:10.040
I was like, oh, this would all like not work.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.080
And you look at the sun, right?

08:12.080 --> 08:15.440
So it turns out that there are key reactions

08:15.440 --> 08:17.560
that if they had slightly lower probability,

08:17.560 --> 08:19.120
no star would ever ignite

08:20.320 --> 08:21.880
and then life wouldn't be possible.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.280
It does seem like the universe set things up for us

08:26.280 --> 08:29.160
that it's possible to do some cool things,

08:29.160 --> 08:30.680
but it's challenging.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.000
So that keeps it fun for us.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.480
Yeah, yeah, that's the way I look at it.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.360
I mean, the multiverse model is an interesting one

08:38.360 --> 08:40.760
because there are quantum scientists who look at it

08:40.760 --> 08:42.880
and figure, it's like, oh, it's like, oh yeah.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.600
Like quantum science perhaps tells us

08:44.600 --> 08:46.760
that there are almost an infinite variety

08:46.760 --> 08:48.760
of other universes.

08:48.760 --> 08:51.280
But the way that it works probably is,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.080
it's almost like a form of natural selection.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.640
It's like, well, the universes that didn't have

08:55.640 --> 08:58.240
the correct or interesting relationships

08:58.240 --> 09:00.960
between these forces, nothing happens in them.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.160
So almost by definition,

09:02.160 --> 09:04.360
the fact that we're having this conversation

09:04.360 --> 09:07.560
means that we're in one of the interesting ones by default.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.040
Yeah, one of the somewhat interesting,

09:09.040 --> 09:11.840
but there's probably super interesting ones

09:11.840 --> 09:15.880
where I tend to think of humans as incredible creatures.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.520
Our brain is an incredible computing device,

09:18.520 --> 09:22.960
but I think we're also extremely cognitively limited.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.600
I can imagine alien civilizations

09:25.600 --> 09:28.600
that are much, much, much, much more intelligent

09:28.600 --> 09:30.200
in ways we can't even comprehend

09:30.200 --> 09:34.280
in terms of their ability to construct models of the world,

09:34.280 --> 09:36.920
to do physics, to do physics and mathematics.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.240
I would see it in a slightly different way.

09:39.240 --> 09:44.360
It's actually, it's because we have creatures

09:44.360 --> 09:47.240
that live with us on the earth that have cognition,

09:47.240 --> 09:49.760
that understand and move through their environment.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.080
But they actually see things in a way,

09:53.080 --> 09:54.560
or they sense things in a way

09:54.560 --> 09:58.040
which is so fundamentally different, it's really hard.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.680
Like the problem is the translation,

10:00.680 --> 10:02.040
not necessarily intelligence.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.480
So it's the perception of the world.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.040
So I have a dog, and when I go and I see my dog,

10:07.040 --> 10:10.360
like smelling things, there's a realization that I have

10:10.360 --> 10:14.840
that he sees or senses the world in a way that I can never,

10:14.840 --> 10:16.040
like I can't understand it

10:16.040 --> 10:18.600
because I can't translate my way to this.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.240
We get little glimpses of this as humans though, by the way,

10:21.240 --> 10:23.640
because there are some parts of it, for example,

10:23.640 --> 10:26.920
optical information, which comes from light,

10:26.920 --> 10:29.520
is that now, because we've developed the technology,

10:29.520 --> 10:32.440
we can actually see things, you know, I've had,

10:32.440 --> 10:35.760
I get this, you know, as one of my areas of research

10:35.760 --> 10:38.400
is spectroscopy, so this means the study of light.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.120
You know, and I get this quote unquote,

10:40.120 --> 10:42.920
see things or representations of them from, you know,

10:42.920 --> 10:46.480
the far infrared all the way to like hard, hard X-rays,

10:46.480 --> 10:48.800
which is several orders of magnitude

10:48.800 --> 10:52.320
of the light intensity, but our own human eyes,

10:52.320 --> 10:55.560
like see a teeny, teeny little sliver of this

10:55.560 --> 10:57.360
so that even like bees, for example,

10:57.360 --> 10:59.440
see a different place than we do.

10:59.440 --> 11:02.520
So I don't, I think if you think of,

11:02.520 --> 11:06.080
there's already other intelligences like around us

11:06.080 --> 11:08.880
in a way, in a limited way

11:08.880 --> 11:10.360
because of the way they can communicate,

11:10.360 --> 11:14.560
but it's like those are already baffling in many ways, yeah.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.240
If we just focus in on the senses,

11:16.240 --> 11:18.320
there's already a lot of diversity,

11:18.320 --> 11:19.320
but there's probably things

11:19.320 --> 11:22.040
we're not even considering as possibilities.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.760
For example, whatever the heck consciousness is,

11:27.240 --> 11:30.280
could actually be a door into understanding

11:30.280 --> 11:31.680
some physical phenomena we're not,

11:31.680 --> 11:33.560
haven't even begun understanding.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.600
So just like you said, spectroscopy,

11:35.600 --> 11:37.160
there could be a similar kind of spectrum

11:37.160 --> 11:39.240
for consciousness that we're just like,

11:39.240 --> 11:42.800
we're like these dumb descendants of apes

11:42.920 --> 11:43.760
walking around.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.760
It sure feels like something to experience the color red,

11:46.760 --> 11:48.360
but like we don't have,

11:48.360 --> 11:50.240
it's the same as in the ancient times

11:50.240 --> 11:52.560
you experience physics, you experience light.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.080
It's like, oh, it's bright and you know,

11:55.080 --> 11:58.720
and you construct kind of semi-religious kind of explanations.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.080
We might actually experience this faster than we thought

12:01.080 --> 12:05.040
because we might be building another kind of intelligence.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.680
Yeah, and that intelligence will explain to us

12:07.680 --> 12:10.080
how silly we are.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.080
There was an email thread going around

12:12.080 --> 12:14.880
the professors in my department already of,

12:14.880 --> 12:17.040
so what is it going to look like to figure out

12:17.040 --> 12:19.840
if students have actually written their term papers

12:19.840 --> 12:24.840
or it's chat, chat GPT, it was,

12:25.920 --> 12:30.920
so as usual, we tend to be empiricists in my field.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.280
So of course they were in there like trying to figure out

12:34.280 --> 12:36.960
if it could answer like questions for a qualifying exam

12:36.960 --> 12:39.720
to get into the PhD program at MIT,

12:39.880 --> 12:42.840
which was, they didn't do that well at that point,

12:42.840 --> 12:44.520
but of course this is just the beginning of it.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.080
So we have some interesting ones to go for.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.040
Eventually both the students and the professors

12:48.040 --> 12:51.960
will be replaced by chat GPT and we'll sit on the beach.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.720
I really recommend, you know,

12:53.720 --> 12:54.680
I don't know if you've ever seen them,

12:54.680 --> 12:57.400
it's called The Day the Universe Changed.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.640
This is James Burke.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.000
He's a science historian based in the UK.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.240
He had a fairly famous series on public television

13:07.240 --> 13:08.840
called Connections, I think it was,

13:08.840 --> 13:10.640
but the one that I really enjoyed

13:10.640 --> 13:12.840
was The Day the Universe Changed.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.400
And the reason for the title of it was that,

13:18.040 --> 13:22.720
it says the universe is what we know and perceive of it.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.320
So when there's a fundamental insight as to something new,

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
the universe for us changes.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.440
Of course, the universe from an objective point of view

13:30.440 --> 13:33.360
is the same as it was before, but for us it has changed.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.640
So he walks through these moments of perception

13:38.480 --> 13:42.840
in the history of humanity that changed what we were, right?

13:42.840 --> 13:46.840
And so as I was thinking about coming to discuss this,

13:46.840 --> 13:48.960
people see fusion, oh, it's still far away,

13:48.960 --> 13:51.320
or we've been, it's been slow progress.

13:51.320 --> 13:55.240
It's like when my godmother was born,

13:55.240 --> 13:58.040
people had no idea how stars worked.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.520
So you talk about that day, that insight,

14:01.520 --> 14:04.560
the universe changed, it's like, oh, this is the,

14:04.560 --> 14:06.840
I mean, and they still didn't understand all the parts of it,

14:06.840 --> 14:08.800
but they basically got it.

14:08.800 --> 14:13.040
It was like, oh, because of the understanding

14:13.040 --> 14:16.160
of these processes, it's like we unveiled the reason

14:16.160 --> 14:18.320
that there can be life in the universe.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.560
That's probably one of those days the universe changed,

14:20.560 --> 14:21.400
right?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.800
And that was around the 1930s, yeah.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.800
It seems like technology is developing faster

14:25.800 --> 14:26.960
and faster and faster.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.160
I tend to think that just like with Chad JPT,

14:30.160 --> 14:32.880
I think this year might be extremely interesting,

14:32.920 --> 14:37.400
just with how rapid and how profitable the efforts

14:37.400 --> 14:39.080
in artificial intelligence are,

14:39.080 --> 14:42.000
that just stuff will happen where our whole world

14:42.000 --> 14:45.800
is transformed like this, and there's a shock,

14:45.800 --> 14:47.520
and then next day you kind of go on

14:47.520 --> 14:48.880
and you adjust immediately.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.520
You probably won't have a similar kind of thing

14:51.520 --> 14:53.960
with nuclear fusion with energy,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.840
because there's probably going to be an opening ceremony

14:56.840 --> 14:57.680
and stuff like that.

14:57.680 --> 15:00.160
It's gonna be an announcement, it'll take months.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.000
But with digital technology,

15:02.000 --> 15:05.600
you can just have an immediate transformation of society,

15:05.600 --> 15:08.880
and then it'll be this gasp, and then you kind of adjust,

15:08.880 --> 15:09.720
like we always do.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.200
And then you don't even remember,

15:11.200 --> 15:12.760
just like with the internet and so on,

15:12.760 --> 15:14.080
how the days were before.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
And how it worked before, right?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.960
I mean, fusion will be because it's energy,

15:18.960 --> 15:21.360
it's nature is that it will be,

15:21.360 --> 15:22.920
and anything that has to do with energy use

15:22.920 --> 15:25.040
tends to be a slower transition,

15:25.040 --> 15:27.160
but they're the most, I would argue,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.120
some of the most profound transitions that we make.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.880
The reason that we can live like this

15:33.880 --> 15:36.160
and sit in this building and have this podcast

15:36.160 --> 15:39.520
and people around the world at its heart is energy use,

15:39.520 --> 15:42.720
and it's intense energy use that came from the evolution

15:42.720 --> 15:44.280
of starting to use intense energies

15:44.280 --> 15:47.400
at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution up to now.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.560
It's like it's a bedrock actually of all of these,

15:50.560 --> 15:52.720
but it doesn't tend to come overnight.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.040
And some of the most important,

15:55.040 --> 15:56.400
some of the most amazing technologies

15:56.400 --> 15:57.240
one we don't notice,

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
because we take it for granted,

15:58.240 --> 16:00.080
because it enables this whole thing.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.200
Yeah, exactly, which is energy,

16:02.200 --> 16:07.120
which is amazing for how fundamental it is to our society

16:07.120 --> 16:11.120
and way of life is a very poorly understood concept,

16:11.120 --> 16:13.040
actually, just even energy itself.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.000
People confuse energy sources with energy storage,

16:17.000 --> 16:18.280
with energy transmission.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.800
These are different physical phenomena,

16:21.800 --> 16:23.400
which are very important.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.000
So for example, you buy an electric car and you go,

16:27.000 --> 16:29.280
oh, good, I have an emission-free car.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.200
And, ah, but it's like, so why do you say that?

16:34.200 --> 16:36.440
Well, it's because if I draw the circle around the car,

16:36.440 --> 16:39.800
I have electricity and it doesn't emit anything.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.600
Okay, but you plug that into a grid

16:41.600 --> 16:43.400
where you follow that wire back,

16:43.400 --> 16:45.120
there could be a coal power plant

16:45.120 --> 16:47.560
or a gas power plant at the end of that.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.760
Oh, really?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.520
I mean, so this isn't like carbon-free?

16:50.520 --> 16:53.680
Oh, and it's not their fault, it's just, you know,

16:53.680 --> 16:57.160
they don't, like the car isn't a source of energy.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.520
The underlying source of energy

16:58.520 --> 17:01.160
was the combustion of the fuel back somewhere.

17:01.160 --> 17:05.640
Plus there's also a story of how the raw materials are mined

17:05.640 --> 17:09.600
in which parts of the world with sort of basic respect

17:09.600 --> 17:11.880
or deep disrespect of human rights

17:11.880 --> 17:12.920
that happens in that money.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.360
So the whole supply chain, there's a story there

17:15.360 --> 17:17.560
that's deeper than just a particular electric car

17:17.560 --> 17:18.480
with a circle around it.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.240
And the physics or the science of it too

17:20.240 --> 17:23.280
is the energy use that it takes to do that digging up,

17:23.280 --> 17:25.280
which is also important and all that.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.360
Yeah, anyway, so we wandered away from fusion,

17:28.360 --> 17:31.800
but yes, but it's very important actually

17:31.800 --> 17:34.720
in the context of this, just because, you know,

17:34.720 --> 17:38.280
those of us who work in fusion and these other kinds

17:38.280 --> 17:42.200
of sort of disruptive energy technologies,

17:42.200 --> 17:44.440
it's interesting, I do think about like,

17:44.440 --> 17:47.240
what would it, what is it going to mean to society

17:47.240 --> 17:50.240
to have an energy source that is like this,

17:50.240 --> 17:52.000
that would be like fusion, you know,

17:52.040 --> 17:55.960
which has such completely different characteristics.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.160
You know, for example, you know,

17:57.160 --> 17:59.760
free unlimited access to the fuel,

17:59.760 --> 18:01.880
but it has technology implications.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.560
So what does this mean geopolitically?

18:03.560 --> 18:06.680
What does it mean for how we distribute wealth

18:06.680 --> 18:07.880
within our society?

18:07.880 --> 18:12.880
It's very difficult to know, but probably profound, yeah.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.200
We're gonna have to find another reason

18:14.200 --> 18:18.160
to start wars instead of resources.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.000
We're gonna have to figure something else out.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.280
We've done a pretty good job of that

18:20.280 --> 18:23.360
over the course of our histories, yeah.

18:23.360 --> 18:26.000
So we talked about the forces of physics,

18:26.000 --> 18:27.960
and again, sticking to the philosophical

18:27.960 --> 18:31.160
before we get to the specific technical stuff,

18:31.160 --> 18:32.720
E equals MC squared, you mentioned.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.000
How amazing is that to you,

18:34.000 --> 18:36.680
that energy and mass are the same?

18:36.680 --> 18:39.120
And what does that have to do with nuclear fusion?

18:39.120 --> 18:40.640
So it has to do with everything we do.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.720
It's the fact that energy and mass

18:42.720 --> 18:43.960
are equivalent to each other.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.600
They're just, the way we usually comment to it

18:46.600 --> 18:49.440
is that they're just energy just in different forms.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.960
Can you intuitively understand that?

18:51.960 --> 18:54.440
Yes, but it takes a long time.

18:54.440 --> 18:59.400
I haven't for all, but usually,

18:59.400 --> 19:03.720
often I teach the introductory class

19:03.720 --> 19:05.760
for incoming nuclear engineers.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.440
And so we put this up as an equation

19:08.440 --> 19:12.160
and we go through many iterations of using this,

19:12.160 --> 19:15.960
how you derive it, how you use it and so forth.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.440
And then usually in the final exam,

19:19.440 --> 19:21.200
I would basically take all the equations

19:21.200 --> 19:23.040
that I've used before and I flip it around.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.720
I basically, instead of thinking about energy

19:25.720 --> 19:28.600
is equal to mass, it's sort of mass is equal to energy.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.760
And I asked the question in a different way

19:30.760 --> 19:32.800
and usually about half the students don't get it.

19:32.800 --> 19:35.680
It takes a while to get that intuition.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.440
Yeah, so in the end, it's interesting is that

19:39.440 --> 19:42.400
this is actually the source of all free energy

19:42.400 --> 19:43.960
because that energy that we're talking about

19:43.960 --> 19:47.520
is kinetic energy, if it can be transformed from mass.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.800
So it turns out even though we used equals MC squared,

19:51.800 --> 19:55.480
this was burning coal and burning gas

19:55.480 --> 19:58.560
and burning wood is actually still equals MC squared.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
The problem is that you would never know this

20:00.560 --> 20:04.280
because the relative change in the mass is incredibly small.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.880
By the way, which comes back to fusion,

20:05.880 --> 20:08.320
which is that equals MC squared.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.520
Okay, so what does this mean?

20:09.520 --> 20:12.000
It tells you that the amount of energy

20:12.000 --> 20:14.520
that is liberated in a particular reaction

20:14.520 --> 20:16.720
when you change mass has to,

20:16.720 --> 20:19.240
because C squared is that's the speed of light squared.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.080
It's a large number.

20:20.080 --> 20:20.960
It's a very large number

20:20.960 --> 20:23.120
and it's totally constant everywhere in the universe,

20:23.120 --> 20:24.440
which is another weird thing.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.240
Which is another weird thing and in all rest frames

20:26.240 --> 20:30.760
and actually the relatively stuff gets more difficult

20:30.760 --> 20:32.400
conceptually until you get through.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.960
Anyway, so you go to that and what that tells you

20:36.960 --> 20:40.280
is that it's the relative change in the mass

20:40.280 --> 20:41.720
will tell you about the relative amount

20:41.720 --> 20:43.240
of energy that's liberated.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.840
And this is what makes fusion

20:44.840 --> 20:46.280
and you asked about fission as well too.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.040
This is what makes them extraordinary.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.000
It's because the relative change in the mass is very large

20:53.000 --> 20:56.120
as compared to what you get like in a chemical reaction.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.040
In fact, it's about 10 million times larger.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.360
And that is at the heart

21:02.360 --> 21:04.800
of why you use something like fusion.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.440
It's because that is a fundamental of nature.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.400
Like you can't beat that.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.200
So of whatever you do, if you're thinking about,

21:13.200 --> 21:14.360
and why do I care about this?

21:14.360 --> 21:17.520
Well, because mass is like the fuel, right?

21:17.520 --> 21:20.400
So this means gathering the resources that it takes

21:20.400 --> 21:23.880
to gather a fuel, to hold it together, to deal with it,

21:23.880 --> 21:26.360
the environmental impact it would have.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.720
And fusion will always have 20 million times

21:29.720 --> 21:32.840
the amount of energy release per reaction

21:32.840 --> 21:33.680
that you get to those.

21:33.680 --> 21:36.480
So this is why we consider it the ultimate

21:36.480 --> 21:38.800
like environmentally friendly energy source

21:38.800 --> 21:40.200
is because of that.

21:40.200 --> 21:44.360
So is it correct to think of mass broadly

21:44.360 --> 21:46.040
as a kind of storage of energy?

21:46.040 --> 21:47.600
Yes.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.440
You mentioned it's environmentally friendly.

21:49.440 --> 21:53.000
So nuclear fusion is a source of energy.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.840
It's cheap, clean, safe.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.560
So easy access to fuel and virtually unlimited supply,

21:57.560 --> 21:59.440
no production of greenhouse gases,

21:59.440 --> 22:04.000
little radioactive waste produced allegedly.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.720
Can you sort of elaborate why it's cheap, clean and safe?

22:07.720 --> 22:09.480
I'll start with the easiest one, cheap.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.280
It is not cheap yet,

22:11.280 --> 22:14.000
because it hasn't been made at a commercial scale.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.800
Ryan flies when you're having fun, but yes.

22:15.800 --> 22:16.640
Yeah, yeah.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.560
But yes, not yet.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.400
We'll talk about it.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.960
Actually, we'll come back to that

22:21.960 --> 22:26.960
because this is cheaper or a more technically correct term

22:27.320 --> 22:29.840
that it's economically interesting

22:29.840 --> 22:33.280
is really the primary challenge actually

22:33.280 --> 22:34.800
of fusion at this point.

22:35.760 --> 22:36.920
But I think we can get back to that.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.480
So what were the other ones you said?

22:38.480 --> 22:41.440
So cheap, actually when we're talking about cheap,

22:41.440 --> 22:42.800
we're thinking like asymptotically,

22:42.800 --> 22:47.280
like if you take it forward several hundred years,

22:47.280 --> 22:51.400
that's sort of because of how much availability

22:51.400 --> 22:52.920
there is of resources to use.

22:52.920 --> 22:53.760
Of the fuel.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.580
Yeah, of the fuel.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.880
We should separate those two.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.280
The fuel is already cheap.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.280
It's basically free, right?

23:00.280 --> 23:01.720
What do you mean by basically free?

23:01.720 --> 23:06.200
So if we were to be using fusion fuel sources

23:06.200 --> 23:08.680
to power your, and it's like,

23:08.680 --> 23:10.680
that's all we had was fusion power plants around

23:10.680 --> 23:11.680
and we were doing it.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.360
The fuel costs per person are something like 10 cents a year.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.480
It's free, okay.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.760
This is why it's hard to,

23:18.760 --> 23:21.800
in some ways I think it's hard to understand fusion

23:21.800 --> 23:23.200
because people see this and go,

23:23.200 --> 23:24.600
oh, if the fuel is free,

23:24.600 --> 23:26.680
this means the energy source is free

23:26.680 --> 23:29.160
because we're used to energy sources like this.

23:29.160 --> 23:33.720
So we spend resources and drill to get gas or oil

23:33.720 --> 23:35.920
or we chop wood or we make coal.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.080
We find coal or these things, right?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.760
So fusion, this is what makes fusion.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.440
And it's also, it's not an intermittent renewable

23:44.440 --> 23:46.280
energy source like wind and solar.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.600
So it's like, but this makes it hard to understand.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.160
So if you're saying the fuel is free,

23:50.160 --> 23:53.760
why isn't the energy source free?

23:53.760 --> 23:57.240
And it's because of the necessary technologies

23:57.240 --> 24:01.640
which must be applied to basically recreate the conditions

24:01.640 --> 24:05.360
which are in stars, in the center of stars in fact.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.000
So there's only one natural place in the universe

24:08.000 --> 24:10.600
that fusion energy occurs.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.760
That's in the center of stars.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.360
So that's going to bring a price to it

24:15.360 --> 24:18.400
depending on the cost and, sorry,

24:18.400 --> 24:20.920
the size and complexity of the technology

24:20.920 --> 24:22.800
that's needed to recreate those things.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.120
And we'll talk about the details of those technologies

24:25.120 --> 24:27.520
and which parts might be expensive today

24:27.520 --> 24:29.880
and which parts might be expensive in too long.

24:29.880 --> 24:30.920
Exactly.

24:30.920 --> 24:34.480
It will have a revolution, I'm certain of it.

24:34.480 --> 24:37.720
So about clean, so clean is at its heart,

24:37.720 --> 24:41.280
what it does is convert, it basically converts hydrogen

24:41.280 --> 24:44.320
into its heavier forms of hydrogen,

24:44.320 --> 24:48.480
the one, the most predominant one that we use on earth

24:48.480 --> 24:51.600
and converts it into helium and some other products,

24:51.600 --> 24:54.120
but primarily helium is the product that's left behind.

24:54.120 --> 24:57.800
So helium, safe, inert, gas, you know.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.960
In fact, that's actually what our sun is doing

24:59.960 --> 25:01.720
is eventually going to extinguish itself

25:01.720 --> 25:03.720
because it'll just make so much helium

25:03.760 --> 25:05.040
and it doesn't do that.

25:05.040 --> 25:09.640
So in that sense, clean because there's no emissions

25:09.640 --> 25:12.840
of carbon or pollutants that come directly

25:12.840 --> 25:15.520
from the combustion of the fuel itself.

25:15.520 --> 25:16.680
And safe.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.320
Safe, yeah.

25:18.320 --> 25:20.120
We're talking about very high temperatures.

25:20.120 --> 25:22.760
Yeah, so this is also the counterintuitive thing.

25:22.760 --> 25:26.280
So I told you temperatures, which like 50 million degrees

25:26.280 --> 25:28.040
or it actually tends to be more like

25:28.040 --> 25:31.200
about 100 million degrees is really what we aim for.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.760
So how can 100 million degrees be safe?

25:33.760 --> 25:37.000
And it's safe because it is,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.560
this is so much hotter than anything on earth

25:40.560 --> 25:43.200
where everything on earth is at around 300 Kelvin,

25:43.200 --> 25:46.440
you know, it's around a few tens of degrees Celsius.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.560
And what this means is that in order to get a medium

25:50.560 --> 25:53.920
to those temperatures, you have to completely isolate it

25:53.920 --> 25:56.880
from anything to do with terrestrial environment.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.840
It can have no contact like with anything on earth basically.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.760
So this means what we, this is the technology

26:03.760 --> 26:06.120
that I just described is it fundamentally,

26:06.120 --> 26:08.680
what it does is it takes this fuel

26:08.680 --> 26:11.680
and it isolates it from any terrestrial conditions

26:11.680 --> 26:13.440
so that it has no idea it's on earth.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.800
It's not touching any object that's at room temperature.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.720
Including the walls of the containment.

26:18.720 --> 26:21.280
Even the, including the walls of the containment building

26:21.280 --> 26:24.840
or containment device or even air or anything like this.

26:24.840 --> 26:29.840
So it's that part that makes it safe in this

26:30.080 --> 26:31.720
and there's actually another aspect to it.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.080
But that fundamental part makes it so safe.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.920
And in the mainline approach to fusion

26:39.920 --> 26:42.200
is also that it's very hot

26:42.200 --> 26:46.560
where there's very, very few particles in at any time

26:46.560 --> 26:48.840
in the thing that would be the power plant.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.080
That actually the more correct way to do it is you say,

26:51.080 --> 26:54.360
there's very few particles per unit volume.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.560
So in a cubic centimeter and cubic meter,

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
some of that, so we can do this.

26:57.560 --> 27:00.680
So right now we're, although we don't think of air really

27:00.680 --> 27:04.160
as there's atoms floating around us and there's a density

27:04.160 --> 27:05.680
because if I wave my hand,

27:05.680 --> 27:08.240
I can feel the air pushing against my face.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.520
That means we're in a fluid or a gas, which is around us.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.520
That has a particular number of atoms per cubic meter, right?

27:16.800 --> 27:19.920
So it's what this actually turns out to be 10 to the 25th.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.960
So this is one with 25 zeros behind it per cubic meter.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.400
So we can figure out what a cubic,

27:25.400 --> 27:27.480
like cubic meters about like this,

27:27.480 --> 27:30.680
the volume of this table, like the whole volume of this table.

27:30.680 --> 27:31.600
Okay, very good.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
So like fusion, there's a few of those.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.920
So fusion, like the mainstream one of fusion,

27:36.920 --> 27:38.640
like what we're working on at MIT

27:38.640 --> 27:41.840
will have a hundred thousand times less particles

27:42.760 --> 27:45.200
per unit volume than that.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.320
So this is very interesting

27:46.320 --> 27:50.000
because it's extraordinarily hot, 100 million degrees,

27:50.000 --> 27:51.520
but it's very tenuous.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.160
And what matters from the engineering

27:54.160 --> 27:57.720
and safety point of view is the amount of energy

27:57.720 --> 28:00.480
which is stored per unit volume,

28:00.480 --> 28:04.160
because this tells you about the scenarios

28:04.160 --> 28:05.640
and that's what you worry about

28:05.640 --> 28:08.160
because when those kinds of energies are released,

28:08.160 --> 28:11.560
suddenly it's like what would be the consequences, right?

28:11.560 --> 28:14.720
So the consequences of this are essentially zero

28:14.720 --> 28:18.760
because that's less energy content than boiling water.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.720
Because of the low density?

28:21.720 --> 28:22.800
Because of the low density.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.760
So if you take water is at about a hundred million

28:26.760 --> 28:29.880
to a billion times more dense than this.

28:29.880 --> 28:33.120
So even though it's at much lower temperature,

28:33.120 --> 28:36.080
it's actually still, it has more energy content.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.960
So for this reason, one of the ways that I explain this

28:39.960 --> 28:41.600
is that if you imagine a power plant

28:41.600 --> 28:44.480
that's like powering Cambridge, Massachusetts,

28:44.480 --> 28:47.160
like if you were to, which you wouldn't do this directly,

28:47.160 --> 28:49.200
but if you went like this on it,

28:49.200 --> 28:52.040
it actually extinguishes the fusion

28:52.040 --> 28:56.240
because it gets too cold immediately, yeah.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.320
So that's the other one.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.280
And the other part is that it does not,

28:59.280 --> 29:03.800
because it works by staying hot rather than a chain reaction,

29:03.800 --> 29:05.320
it can't run out of control.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.200
That's the other part of it.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.480
So by the way, this is what very much distinguishes it

29:09.480 --> 29:12.280
from fission, it's not a process that can run away from you

29:12.280 --> 29:15.240
because it's basically thermally stable.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.400
What does thermally stable mean?

29:16.400 --> 29:18.160
That means is that you want to run it

29:18.160 --> 29:20.480
at the optimization in temperature

29:20.480 --> 29:22.800
such that if it deviates away from that temperature,

29:22.800 --> 29:24.920
the reactivity gets lower.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.000
And the reason for this is because it's hard

29:27.000 --> 29:28.720
to keep the reactivity going.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.520
Like it's a very hard fire to keep going basically.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.360
Oh, so it doesn't run away from you.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.480
It can't run away from you.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.240
How difficult is the control there to keep it at that?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.800
It varies from concept to concept,

29:39.800 --> 29:43.880
but in generally it's fairly easy to do that.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.920
And the easiest thing, it can't physically run away

29:46.920 --> 29:49.440
from you because the other part of it is that there's just

29:49.440 --> 29:52.240
at any given time, there's a very, very small amount

29:52.240 --> 29:55.320
of fuel available to fuse anyway.

29:55.320 --> 29:58.160
So this means that that's always intrinsically

29:58.160 --> 29:59.000
limited to this.

29:59.000 --> 30:02.680
So even if the power consumption of the device goes up,

30:02.680 --> 30:05.480
it just kind of burns itself out immediately, yeah.

30:05.480 --> 30:08.680
So you are the, just to take another tangent on a tangent,

30:08.680 --> 30:09.960
you're the director of MIT's

30:09.960 --> 30:11.760
Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.760
We'll talk about, maybe you can mention some interesting

30:15.760 --> 30:20.760
aspects of the history of the center in the broader history

30:21.080 --> 30:24.760
of MIT and maybe broader history of science and engineering

30:24.760 --> 30:26.320
in the history of human civilization,

30:26.320 --> 30:30.440
but also just the link on the safety aspect, you know.

30:32.680 --> 30:37.000
How do you prevent some of the amazing reactors

30:37.000 --> 30:40.560
that you're designing, how do you prevent from destroying

30:40.560 --> 30:42.920
all of human civilization in the process?

30:42.920 --> 30:44.360
What's the safety protocols?

30:44.360 --> 30:47.800
Fusion is interesting because it's not really

30:47.800 --> 30:51.360
directly weaponizable because what I mean by that

30:51.360 --> 30:55.640
is that you have to work very hard to make these conditions

30:55.640 --> 30:59.800
at which you can get energy gain from fusion.

30:59.800 --> 31:04.640
And this means that when we design these devices

31:04.640 --> 31:07.880
with respect to application in the energy field

31:07.880 --> 31:12.880
is that they, you know, while they will,

31:13.440 --> 31:15.640
because they're producing large amounts of power

31:15.640 --> 31:17.480
and they will have hot things inside of them,

31:17.480 --> 31:20.720
this means that they have like a level of industrial hazard

31:20.720 --> 31:22.560
which is very similar to what you would have

31:22.560 --> 31:25.720
like in a chemical processing plant or anything like that.

31:25.720 --> 31:29.320
And any kind of energy plant actually has these as well too.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.720
But the underlying, underneath it core technology

31:32.720 --> 31:37.240
like can't be directly used in a nefarious way

31:37.280 --> 31:39.160
because of the power that's being emitted.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.120
It just basically, well, if you try to do those things,

31:42.120 --> 31:43.600
typically it just stops working.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.200
So the safety concerns have to do with just regular things

31:46.200 --> 31:51.200
that like equipment malfunctioning, melting,

31:51.480 --> 31:53.640
like all this kind of stuff that has nothing to do

31:53.640 --> 31:54.960
with fusion necessarily.

31:54.960 --> 31:58.040
I mean, usually what we worry about is the viability

31:58.040 --> 32:01.280
because in the end we build pretty complex objects

32:01.280 --> 32:03.320
to realize these requirements.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.840
And so what we try really hard to do is like

32:05.840 --> 32:07.840
not damage those components,

32:07.840 --> 32:09.440
but those are things which are internal

32:09.440 --> 32:11.560
to the fusion device.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.920
And this is not something that you would consider

32:15.920 --> 32:18.960
about like it would, as you say, destroy human civilization

32:18.960 --> 32:22.000
because that release of energy is just inherently limited

32:22.000 --> 32:23.720
because of the fusion process.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.360
So it doesn't say that there's zero.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.640
So you asked about the other feature of it, that it's safe.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.600
So it is, the process itself is intrinsically safe

32:31.600 --> 32:33.880
but because it's a complex technology,

32:33.880 --> 32:36.760
you still have to take into consideration aspects

32:36.760 --> 32:38.000
of the safety.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.680
So it produces ionizing radiation instantaneously.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.000
So you have to take care of this,

32:43.000 --> 32:44.760
which means that you shield it.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.080
Think of like your dental x-rays or treatments for cancer

32:48.080 --> 32:48.920
and things like this.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.920
We always shield ourselves from this.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.360
So we get the beneficial effects,

32:52.360 --> 32:54.680
but we minimize the harmful effects of those.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.120
So there are all those aspects of it as well too.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.320
So we'll return to MIT's Plasma Science and Future Center,

33:01.320 --> 33:05.280
but let us linger on the destruction of human civilization,

33:05.280 --> 33:07.800
which brings us to the topic of nuclear fission.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.000
What is that?

33:09.000 --> 33:13.840
So the process that is inside nuclear weapons

33:13.840 --> 33:16.040
and current nuclear power plants.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.520
So it relies on the same underlying physical principle,

33:20.520 --> 33:22.920
but it's exactly the opposite,

33:22.920 --> 33:24.320
which actually the names imply.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.560
Fusion means bringing things together.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.800
Fission means splitting things apart.

33:28.800 --> 33:33.800
So fission requires the heaviest instead of the lightest

33:34.880 --> 33:39.000
and the most unstable versus the most stable elements.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.160
So this tends to be uranium or plutonium,

33:42.160 --> 33:43.120
primarily uranium.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.680
So take uranium.

33:44.680 --> 33:49.400
So uranium-235 is one of the heaviest unstable elements.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.880
And what happens is that this is,

33:52.880 --> 33:54.920
and fission is triggered by the fact

33:54.920 --> 33:57.120
that one of these subatomic particles, the neutron,

33:57.120 --> 33:58.960
which has no electric charge,

33:58.960 --> 34:02.080
basically gets in proximity enough to this

34:02.080 --> 34:04.960
and triggers an instability effectively

34:04.960 --> 34:09.760
inside of what is teetering on the border of instability

34:09.760 --> 34:11.440
and basically splits it apart.

34:12.360 --> 34:15.160
And that's the fission, the fissioning.

34:15.160 --> 34:17.400
And so when that happens,

34:17.400 --> 34:22.400
because the products that are roughly splits in two,

34:22.440 --> 34:24.120
but it's not even that, it's actually more complicated,

34:24.120 --> 34:27.080
it splits into this whole array of lighter elements

34:28.040 --> 34:28.880
and nuclei.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.240
And when that happens, there's less rest mass

34:34.560 --> 34:36.640
left than the original one.

34:36.640 --> 34:38.680
So it's actually the same, so it's again,

34:38.680 --> 34:41.160
it's rearrangement of the strong nuclear force

34:41.160 --> 34:44.880
that's happening, but that's the source of energy.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.280
And so in the end, it's like,

34:46.280 --> 34:49.440
so this is a famous graph that we show everybody

34:49.440 --> 34:52.680
is basically, it turns out every element

34:52.680 --> 34:54.240
that exists in the periodic table,

34:54.240 --> 34:56.160
all the things that make up everything

34:56.160 --> 34:59.360
have a, remember you asked a good question.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.240
It was like, so should we think of mass

35:01.240 --> 35:03.120
as being the same as stored energy?

35:03.120 --> 35:04.120
Yes.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.920
So you can make a plot that basically shows

35:06.920 --> 35:10.120
the relative amount of stored energy

35:10.120 --> 35:12.400
and all of the elements that are stable

35:12.400 --> 35:15.400
and make up basically the world, okay, and the universe.

35:15.400 --> 35:19.600
And it turns out that this one has a maximum amount

35:19.600 --> 35:22.800
of stability or storage at iron.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.400
So it's kind of in the middle of the periodic table

35:26.400 --> 35:29.680
because this goes from, it's roughly that.

35:29.680 --> 35:34.680
And so what that means is that if you take something heavier

35:35.920 --> 35:39.200
than iron, like uranium, which is more than twice as heavy

35:39.200 --> 35:42.360
than that, and you split apart, somehow just magically,

35:42.360 --> 35:43.840
you can just split apart as constituents

35:43.840 --> 35:46.040
and you get something that's lighter,

35:46.040 --> 35:48.320
because it moves to a more stable energy state,

35:48.320 --> 35:49.520
it releases kinetic energy.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.560
That's the energy that we use.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.680
Kinetic energy meaning the movement of things.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.960
So it's actually an energy you can do something with.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.880
And fusion, it sits on the other side of that

35:58.880 --> 36:01.760
because it's also moving towards iron,

36:01.760 --> 36:05.200
but it has to do it through fusion together.

36:05.200 --> 36:08.520
So this leads to some pretty profound differences.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.800
As I said, they have some underlying physics

36:11.800 --> 36:15.720
or science proximity to each other,

36:15.720 --> 36:16.920
but they're literally the opposite.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.920
So fusion, why is this?

36:18.920 --> 36:21.120
It actually goes in the practical implications of it,

36:21.120 --> 36:24.160
which is that fission could happen at room temperature.

36:24.160 --> 36:28.200
It's because this neutron has no electric charge

36:28.200 --> 36:31.520
and therefore it's literally room temperature neutrons

36:31.520 --> 36:32.960
that actually trigger the reaction.

36:32.960 --> 36:37.960
So this means in order to establish what's going on with it

36:38.040 --> 36:39.880
and it works by chain reaction,

36:39.880 --> 36:41.480
is that you can do this at room temperature.

36:41.480 --> 36:45.560
So Enrico Fermi did this like on a university campus,

36:45.560 --> 36:47.200
University of Chicago campus,

36:47.200 --> 36:49.880
the first sustained chain reaction was done

36:49.880 --> 36:53.840
underneath a squash court with a big blocks of graphite.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.440
It was still, don't get me wrong,

36:55.440 --> 36:57.760
an incredible human achievement, right?

36:57.760 --> 37:00.120
But that's, and then you think about fusion,

37:00.120 --> 37:02.520
I have to build a contraption of some kind

37:02.520 --> 37:04.400
that's going to get to a hundred million degrees.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.680
Okay, wow, that's a big difference.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.000
The other one is about the chain reaction

37:09.000 --> 37:11.960
that namely fission works by the fact that

37:11.960 --> 37:16.240
when that fission occurs, it actually produces free neutrons.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.720
Free neutrons, particularly if they get slowed down

37:18.720 --> 37:22.720
at room temperature, can trigger other fission reactions

37:22.720 --> 37:26.320
if there's other uranium nearby or fissile materials.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.720
So this means that the way that it releases energy

37:28.720 --> 37:31.600
is that you set this up in a very careful way

37:31.600 --> 37:35.960
such that every, on average, every reaction that happens

37:35.960 --> 37:38.440
exactly releases enough neutrons and slows down

37:38.440 --> 37:42.320
that they actually make another reaction, exactly one.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.480
And what this means is that because each reaction

37:44.480 --> 37:47.480
releases a fixed amount of energy, you do this

37:47.480 --> 37:48.680
and then in time, this looks like

37:48.680 --> 37:50.200
just a constant power output.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.040
So that's how our fission power plant works.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.560
And so their control of the chain reactions

37:54.560 --> 37:56.920
is extremely difficult and extremely important for fission.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.000
It's very important.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.640
And when you intentionally design it,

37:59.640 --> 38:03.560
that it creates more than one fission reaction

38:03.560 --> 38:07.160
per starting reaction, then it exponentiates away,

38:08.160 --> 38:10.400
which is what a nuclear weapon is.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.600
Yeah, so how does an atomic weapon work?

38:12.600 --> 38:15.760
How does a hydrogen bomb work, asking for a friend?

38:15.800 --> 38:20.800
Yeah, so at its heart, what you do is you very quickly

38:22.600 --> 38:25.040
put together enough of these materials

38:25.040 --> 38:28.360
that can undergo fission with room temperature neutrons

38:28.360 --> 38:30.880
and you put them together fast enough that what happens

38:30.880 --> 38:35.040
is that this process can essentially grow mathematically,

38:35.040 --> 38:36.400
like very fast.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.040
And so this releases large amounts of energy.

38:39.040 --> 38:42.400
So that's the underlying reason that it works.

38:42.400 --> 38:44.360
So you've heard of a fusion weapon.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.240
So this is interesting is that it is,

38:46.240 --> 38:48.840
but it's dislike fusion energy in the sense

38:48.840 --> 38:53.400
that what happens is that you're using fusion reactions,

38:53.400 --> 38:56.160
but it simply, it increases the gain actually

38:56.160 --> 39:00.120
of the weapon rather than, it's not a pure,

39:00.120 --> 39:02.880
at its heart, it's still a fission weapon.

39:02.880 --> 39:04.760
You're just using fusion reactions

39:04.760 --> 39:07.240
as a sort of intermediate catalyst basically

39:07.240 --> 39:10.200
to get even more energy out of it.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.680
But it's not directly applicable to be used

39:12.680 --> 39:14.760
in an energy source.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.200
Does it terrify you, just again, to step back

39:18.200 --> 39:21.040
at the philosophical that humans have been able

39:21.040 --> 39:24.240
to use physics and engineering

39:24.240 --> 39:27.440
to create such powerful weapons?

39:28.440 --> 39:29.800
I wouldn't say terrify.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.800
I mean, we should be, this is the progress of human.

39:35.160 --> 39:37.640
Every time that we've gotten access,

39:37.640 --> 39:40.040
you're talking, you know, the day the universe changed.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.280
It was really changed when we got access

39:42.280 --> 39:44.160
to new kinds of energy sources.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.400
But every time you get access,

39:45.400 --> 39:48.800
and typically what this meant was you get access

39:48.800 --> 39:50.720
to more intense energy, right?

39:50.720 --> 39:52.080
That's, and that's what that was.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.160
And so the ability to move from burning wood

39:55.160 --> 39:59.080
to using coal, to using gasoline and petrol,

39:59.080 --> 40:03.840
and then finally to use this is that both the potency

40:03.840 --> 40:08.000
and the consequences are elevated around those things.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.120
It's just like you said, the way that fusion,

40:12.120 --> 40:14.920
nuclear fusion would change the world,

40:14.920 --> 40:17.640
I don't think, unless we think really deeply,

40:17.640 --> 40:19.280
we'll be able to anticipate some of the things

40:19.280 --> 40:20.120
we can create.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.440
There's going to be a lot of amazing stuff,

40:22.440 --> 40:25.000
but then that amazing stuff is gonna enable

40:25.000 --> 40:27.680
more amazing stuff and more, unfortunately,

40:27.680 --> 40:31.840
or depending how you see on it, more powerful weapons.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.760
Well, yeah, but see, that's the thing.

40:33.760 --> 40:37.800
Fusion breaks that trend in the following way.

40:37.800 --> 40:42.280
So one of them, so fusion doesn't work on a chain reaction.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.480
There's no chain reaction, zero.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.280
So this means it cannot physically

40:46.280 --> 40:49.120
exponentiate away on you, because it works.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.920
And actually, this is why stars,

40:50.920 --> 40:52.680
by the way, we know this already.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.400
It's why stars are so stable,

40:54.400 --> 40:57.000
why most stars and suns are so stable.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.560
It's because they are regulated

40:59.560 --> 41:02.640
through their own temperature and their heating.

41:02.640 --> 41:05.280
Because what's happening is not that there's some probability

41:05.280 --> 41:07.640
of this exponentiating away, is that the energy

41:07.640 --> 41:08.920
that's being released by fusion

41:08.920 --> 41:10.880
basically is keeping the fire hot.

41:12.120 --> 41:15.000
And these tend to be, and when it comes down

41:15.000 --> 41:16.600
to thermodynamics and things like this,

41:16.600 --> 41:19.120
there's a reason, for example, it's pretty easy

41:19.120 --> 41:21.640
to keep a constant temperature, like in an oven

41:21.640 --> 41:22.480
and things like this.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.400
It's the same thing in fusion.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.000
So this is actually one of the features

41:26.000 --> 41:30.640
that I would argue fusion breaks the trend of this,

41:30.640 --> 41:35.640
is that it has more energy intensity than fission on paper,

41:36.640 --> 41:40.320
but it actually does not have the consequences of control

41:40.320 --> 41:42.760
and sort of rapid release of the energy,

41:42.760 --> 41:45.680
because it's actually, the physical system

41:45.680 --> 41:47.960
just doesn't want to do that.

41:47.960 --> 41:50.520
We're gonna have to look elsewhere for the weapons

41:50.520 --> 41:52.520
with which we fight World War III.

41:53.520 --> 41:54.840
Fair enough.

41:54.840 --> 41:59.840
So what is plasma that you may or may have not mentioned,

42:00.440 --> 42:02.440
you mentioned ions and electrons and so on.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.920
So what is plasma, what is the role

42:03.920 --> 42:05.960
of plasma in nuclear fusion?

42:05.960 --> 42:09.400
So plasma is a phase of matter or state of matter.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.760
So unfortunately, our schools don't,

42:12.760 --> 42:14.320
it's like, I'm not sure why this is the case,

42:14.320 --> 42:18.240
but all children learn the three phases of matter, right?

42:18.240 --> 42:19.640
So, and what does this mean?

42:19.640 --> 42:21.840
So we'll take water as an example.

42:21.840 --> 42:26.640
So if it's cold, it's ice, it's in a solid phase, right?

42:26.640 --> 42:29.160
And then if you heat it up, it's the temperature

42:29.160 --> 42:31.640
that typically depends, sets the phase,

42:31.640 --> 42:33.880
although it's not only temperature.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.240
So you heat it up and you go to a liquid,

42:36.240 --> 42:38.360
and obviously it changes its physical properties

42:38.360 --> 42:41.080
because you can pour it and so forth, right?

42:41.080 --> 42:44.240
And then if you heat this up enough, it turns into a gas,

42:44.240 --> 42:45.560
and a gas behaves differently

42:45.560 --> 42:48.520
because there's a very sudden change in the density,

42:48.520 --> 42:49.800
actually that's what's happening.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.080
So it changes by about a factor of 10,000 in density

42:53.080 --> 42:55.960
from the liquid phase into when you make it into steam

42:55.960 --> 42:58.560
and atmospheric pressure, all very good.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.400
Except the problem is they forgot,

43:00.400 --> 43:02.280
like what happens if you just keep elevating

43:02.280 --> 43:03.440
the temperature?

43:03.440 --> 43:04.960
You don't wanna give kids ideas.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.120
They're gonna start experimenting,

43:07.120 --> 43:08.640
they're gonna start heating up the gas.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.040
It's good to start doing it anyway.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.560
So it turns out that once you get above,

43:13.560 --> 43:16.880
it's approximately five or 10,000 degrees Celsius,

43:16.880 --> 43:18.600
then you hit a new phase of matter.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.160
And actually that's the phase of matter

43:20.160 --> 43:22.620
that is for all, pretty much all the temperatures

43:22.620 --> 43:24.380
that are above that as well too.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.640
And so what does that mean?

43:27.640 --> 43:28.960
So it actually changes phase,

43:28.960 --> 43:30.400
so it's a different state of matter.

43:30.400 --> 43:33.400
And the reason that it becomes a different state of matter

43:34.240 --> 43:36.480
is that it's hot enough that what happens

43:36.480 --> 43:39.080
is that the atoms that make up,

43:39.080 --> 43:40.200
go back to Feynman, right?

43:40.200 --> 43:42.600
Everything's made up of these individual things,

43:42.600 --> 43:43.700
these atoms.

43:43.700 --> 43:46.840
But atoms can actually themselves be,

43:47.960 --> 43:50.800
which are made of nuclei,

43:50.800 --> 43:54.040
which contain the positive particles in the neutrons.

43:54.040 --> 43:57.480
And then the electrons, which are very, very light,

43:57.480 --> 44:00.640
very much less mass than the nucleus

44:00.640 --> 44:01.480
and that surround us.

44:01.480 --> 44:03.200
This is what makes up an atom.

44:03.200 --> 44:06.880
So a plasma is what happens when you start pulling away

44:06.880 --> 44:10.280
enough of those electrons that they're free from the ion.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.480
So almost all the atoms that make us up

44:13.480 --> 44:14.760
and this water and all that,

44:14.760 --> 44:16.880
the electrons are in tightly bound states

44:16.880 --> 44:18.820
and basically they're extremely stable.

44:18.820 --> 44:21.360
Once you're at about 5,000 or 10,000 degrees,

44:21.360 --> 44:23.520
you start pulling off the electrons.

44:23.520 --> 44:27.400
And what this means is that now the medium that is there,

44:27.400 --> 44:31.640
it's constituent particles mostly have net charge on them.

44:31.640 --> 44:32.720
So why does that matter?

44:32.720 --> 44:36.240
It's because now this means that the particles

44:36.240 --> 44:38.920
can interact through their electric charge.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.840
In some sense they were when it was an atom as well too.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.920
But now that they're free particles,

44:42.920 --> 44:44.320
this means that they start,

44:44.320 --> 44:46.280
it fundamentally changes the behavior.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.480
It doesn't behave like a gas.

44:47.480 --> 44:49.480
It doesn't behave like a solid or a liquid.

44:49.480 --> 44:51.400
It behaves like a plasma, right?

44:51.400 --> 44:54.640
And so why is it disappointing

44:54.640 --> 44:55.920
that we don't speak about this?

44:55.920 --> 44:59.440
It's because 99% of the universe is in the plasma state.

44:59.440 --> 45:01.320
It's called stars.

45:01.320 --> 45:04.520
And in fact, our own sun at the center of the sun

45:04.520 --> 45:06.400
is what clearly a plasma,

45:06.400 --> 45:07.960
but actually the surface of the sun,

45:07.960 --> 45:11.840
which is around 5,500 Celsius is also a plasma

45:12.840 --> 45:14.040
because it's hot enough that is that.

45:14.040 --> 45:15.640
In fact, the things that you see,

45:15.640 --> 45:16.880
sometimes you see these pictures

45:16.880 --> 45:19.600
from the surface of the sun, amazing,

45:19.600 --> 45:23.400
like satellite photographs of like those big arms of things

45:23.400 --> 45:25.560
and of light coming off of the surface of the sun

45:25.560 --> 45:27.640
and solar flares, those are plasmas.

45:27.640 --> 45:30.320
What are some interesting ways that this fourth state

45:30.320 --> 45:32.400
of matter is different than gas?

45:32.400 --> 45:34.320
Let's go to how a gas works, right?

45:34.320 --> 45:35.600
So the reason a gas,

45:35.600 --> 45:37.240
and it goes back to Feynman's brilliance

45:37.240 --> 45:39.560
in saying that this is the most important concept.

45:39.560 --> 45:43.200
The reason actually solid, liquid and gas phases work

45:43.200 --> 45:45.640
is because the nature of the interaction

45:45.640 --> 45:47.680
between the atoms changes.

45:47.680 --> 45:51.600
And so in a gas, you can think of this as being this room

45:51.600 --> 45:53.680
and the things, although you can't see them,

45:53.680 --> 45:57.200
is that the molecules are flying around,

45:57.200 --> 45:58.600
but then with some frequency,

45:58.600 --> 46:00.880
they basically bounce into each other.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.720
And when they bounce into each other,

46:02.720 --> 46:07.320
they exchange momentum and energy around on this.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.760
And so it turns out that the probability

46:09.760 --> 46:12.280
and the distances and the scattering

46:12.280 --> 46:13.360
of those of what they do,

46:13.360 --> 46:17.240
it's those interactions that set the,

46:17.240 --> 46:19.320
about how a gas behaves.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.640
So what do you mean by this?

46:20.640 --> 46:24.560
For example, if I take an imaginary test particle

46:24.560 --> 46:27.360
of some kind, like I spray something into the air

46:27.400 --> 46:28.600
and it's got a particular color.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.640
In fact, you can do it in liquids as well too.

46:30.640 --> 46:35.080
Like how it gradually will disperse away from you.

46:35.080 --> 46:38.720
This is fundamentally set because of the way

46:38.720 --> 46:40.760
that those particles are bouncing into each other.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.040
The probabilities of those particles bouncing.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.360
The rate that they go at

46:44.360 --> 46:46.600
and the distance that they go at and so forth.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.800
So this was figured out by Einstein and others

46:48.800 --> 46:51.120
at the beginning of the Brownian motion,

46:51.120 --> 46:52.240
all these kinds of things.

46:52.240 --> 46:55.520
These were set up at the beginning of the last century

46:55.520 --> 46:58.080
and it was really like this great revelation.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.880
Wow, this is why matter behaves the way that it does.

47:00.880 --> 47:01.720
Like, wow.

47:03.440 --> 47:04.840
So, but it's really like,

47:04.840 --> 47:07.160
and also in liquids and in solids,

47:07.160 --> 47:11.480
like what really matters is how you're interacting

47:11.480 --> 47:13.400
with your nearest neighbor.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.840
So you think about that one,

47:14.840 --> 47:16.520
the gas particles are basically going around

47:16.520 --> 47:19.480
until they actually hit into each other though,

47:19.480 --> 47:21.400
they don't really exchange information.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.520
And it's the same in a liquid,

47:22.520 --> 47:23.600
you're kind of beside each other,

47:23.600 --> 47:24.800
but you can kind of move around.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.760
In a solid, you're literally like stuck beside your neighbor,

47:27.760 --> 47:29.760
you can't move like you're moving.

47:29.760 --> 47:34.080
Plasmas are weird in the sense is that it's not like that.

47:34.080 --> 47:37.760
So, and it's because the particles have electric charge,

47:37.760 --> 47:40.680
this means that they can push against each other

47:40.680 --> 47:44.320
without actually being in close proximity to each other.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.120
It's not, that's not an infinitely true statement,

47:47.120 --> 47:49.720
which it goes, it's a little bit more technical,

47:49.720 --> 47:52.840
but basically this means that you can start having action

47:52.840 --> 47:55.920
or exchange of information at a distance.

47:55.920 --> 47:58.120
And that's in fact the definition of a plasma

47:58.120 --> 48:00.120
that it says, these have a technical name,

48:00.120 --> 48:01.440
it's called a Coulomb collision,

48:01.440 --> 48:03.680
it just means that it's dictated by this force,

48:03.680 --> 48:06.600
which is being pushed between the charged particles,

48:06.600 --> 48:10.600
is that the definition of a plasma is a medium

48:10.600 --> 48:13.440
in which the collective behavior is dominated

48:13.440 --> 48:16.040
by these collisions at a distance.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.080
So you can imagine then this starts

48:18.080 --> 48:20.920
to give you some strange behaviors,

48:22.840 --> 48:25.080
which I could quickly talk about,

48:25.080 --> 48:27.800
like for example, one of the most counterintuitive ones

48:27.800 --> 48:32.520
is as plasmas get more hot, as they get higher

48:32.520 --> 48:36.040
in temperature, then the collisions happen less frequently.

48:37.240 --> 48:38.320
Like what?

48:38.320 --> 48:39.400
That doesn't make any sense.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.080
When particles go faster,

48:41.080 --> 48:43.440
you think they would collide more often.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.760
But because the particles are interacting

48:46.760 --> 48:49.520
through their electric field, when they're going faster,

48:49.520 --> 48:51.720
they actually spend less time

48:51.720 --> 48:53.880
in the influential field of each other.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.640
And so they talk to each other less

48:55.640 --> 48:58.520
in an energy and momentum exchange point of view.

48:58.520 --> 49:02.560
It's just one of the counterintuitive aspects of plasmas.

49:02.560 --> 49:06.280
Which is probably very relevant for nuclear fusion.

49:06.280 --> 49:07.360
Yes, exactly.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.200
So if I can try to summarize

49:10.200 --> 49:14.360
what a nuclear fusion reactor is supposed to do.

49:14.360 --> 49:18.040
So you have what, a couple of elements?

49:18.040 --> 49:19.320
What are usually the elements?

49:19.320 --> 49:20.640
Usually deuterium and tritium,

49:20.640 --> 49:22.360
which are the heavy forms of hydrogen.

49:22.360 --> 49:23.200
Hydrogen.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.640
You have those and you start heating it.

49:25.640 --> 49:27.280
And then as you start heating it,

49:27.280 --> 49:28.520
I forgot the temperature you said,

49:28.520 --> 49:29.800
but it becomes plasma. About 100 million.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.480
No, first it becomes.

49:31.480 --> 49:32.560
Oh, first it becomes plasma.

49:32.560 --> 49:35.160
So it's a gas and then it turns into a plasma

49:35.160 --> 49:36.440
at about 10,000 degrees.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.080
And then so you have a bunch of electrons

49:38.080 --> 49:39.800
and ions flying around,

49:39.800 --> 49:42.320
and then you keep heating the thing.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.720
And I guess as you heat the thing,

49:44.720 --> 49:46.960
the ions hit each other rarer and rarer.

49:46.960 --> 49:47.800
Yes.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.560
Man, that's not fun.

49:49.560 --> 49:54.320
So you have to keep heating it such that

49:54.320 --> 49:56.040
you have to keep hitting it

49:56.040 --> 49:58.280
until the probability of them colliding

49:58.280 --> 50:00.080
becomes reasonably high.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.400
And so-

50:01.400 --> 50:03.920
Also on top of that, and sorry to interrupt,

50:03.920 --> 50:07.440
you have to prevent them from hitting the walls

50:07.440 --> 50:09.520
of the reactor somehow.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.080
So you asked about the definitions

50:12.080 --> 50:13.840
of the requirements for fusion.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.720
So the most famous one, or in some sense,

50:15.720 --> 50:17.960
the most intuitive one, is the temperature.

50:17.960 --> 50:19.920
And the reason for that is that

50:19.920 --> 50:22.440
you can make many, many kinds of plasmas

50:22.440 --> 50:24.880
that have zero fusion going on in them.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.960
And the reason for this is that the average,

50:27.960 --> 50:31.000
so you can make a plasma at around 10,000.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.440
In fact, if you come, by the way,

50:32.440 --> 50:35.400
you're welcome to come to our laboratory at the PSFC.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.920
I can show you a demonstration of a plasma

50:37.920 --> 50:39.560
that you can see with your eyes

50:39.560 --> 50:41.240
and sit at about 10,000 degrees.

50:41.240 --> 50:43.880
And you can put your hand up beside it and all this.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.440
And it's like, and nothing, there's zero fusion going on.

50:47.440 --> 50:49.600
So you have, sorry, what was the temperature of the plasma?

50:49.600 --> 50:50.440
About 10,000 degrees.

50:50.440 --> 50:51.800
You can stick your hand in?

50:51.800 --> 50:53.280
Well, you can't stick your hand into it,

50:53.280 --> 50:54.280
but there's a glass tube.

50:54.280 --> 50:56.800
You can basically see this with your bare eye, yeah.

50:56.800 --> 50:58.520
And you can put your hand on the glass tube

50:58.520 --> 50:59.360
because it's-

50:59.360 --> 51:00.480
What's the color, is it purple?

51:00.480 --> 51:01.840
It's purple, yeah, yeah.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.680
It's blue and purple.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.720
It's blue and purple.

51:03.720 --> 51:05.400
It is kind of beautiful.

51:05.400 --> 51:08.560
Yeah, plasmas are actually quite astonishing sometimes

51:08.560 --> 51:09.640
in their beauty.

51:09.640 --> 51:12.040
Actually, one of the most amazing forms of plasma

51:12.040 --> 51:12.920
is lightning, by the way,

51:12.920 --> 51:15.840
which is an instantaneous form of plasma

51:15.840 --> 51:17.880
that exists on earth, but immediately goes away

51:17.880 --> 51:21.000
because everything else around it is at room temperature.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.880
Yeah, so there's different requirements in this.

51:22.880 --> 51:25.880
So making a plasma takes about this,

51:25.880 --> 51:29.840
but at 10,000 degrees, even at a million degrees,

51:29.840 --> 51:32.120
there's almost no probability

51:32.120 --> 51:33.720
of the fusion reactions occurring.

51:33.720 --> 51:37.120
And this is because while the charged particles

51:37.120 --> 51:38.840
can hit into each other,

51:38.840 --> 51:41.040
if you go back to the very beginning of this,

51:41.040 --> 51:43.880
remember I said, oh, these charged particles

51:43.880 --> 51:45.920
have to get to within distances,

51:45.920 --> 51:49.120
which are like this size of a nucleus

51:49.120 --> 51:51.200
because of the strong nuclear force.

51:51.200 --> 51:56.200
Well, unfortunately, as the particles get closer,

51:56.480 --> 51:59.480
the repulsion that comes from the charge,

51:59.480 --> 52:00.960
the Coulomb force,

52:00.960 --> 52:04.760
increases like the inverse distance squared.

52:04.760 --> 52:06.400
So as they get closer,

52:06.400 --> 52:09.400
they're pushing harder and harder apart.

52:09.600 --> 52:11.360
Then it gets a little bit more exotic,

52:11.360 --> 52:12.480
which maybe you'll like though,

52:12.480 --> 52:15.320
that it turns out that people understood this

52:15.320 --> 52:19.560
at the beginning of the age

52:19.560 --> 52:21.480
after Rutherford discovered the nucleus.

52:21.480 --> 52:22.600
It's like, oh, yeah, it's like,

52:22.600 --> 52:25.200
how is this gonna work, right?

52:25.200 --> 52:27.920
Because how do you get anything within these distances

52:27.920 --> 52:30.120
to inquire extraordinary energy?

52:30.120 --> 52:30.960
And it does.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.240
And in fact, when you look at those energies,

52:32.240 --> 52:33.720
they're very, very high.

52:34.920 --> 52:38.400
But it turns out quantum physics comes to the rescue

52:38.400 --> 52:42.160
because the particles aren't actually just particles.

52:42.160 --> 52:43.400
They're also waves.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.240
This is the point of quantum, right?

52:45.240 --> 52:48.640
You can treat them both as waves and as particles.

52:48.640 --> 52:50.560
And it turns out if you get,

52:50.560 --> 52:53.640
if they get in close enough proximity to each other,

52:53.640 --> 52:58.120
then the particle pops through

52:58.120 --> 52:59.800
basically this energy barrier

52:59.800 --> 53:02.800
through an effect called quantum tunneling,

53:02.800 --> 53:04.440
which is really just the transposition

53:04.440 --> 53:06.160
of the fact that it's a wave

53:06.160 --> 53:08.680
so that it has a finite probability of this.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.680
It's, by the way, you talk about like,

53:10.680 --> 53:13.160
do you have a hard time like conceptualizing this?

53:13.160 --> 53:14.520
These are, this is one of them.

53:14.520 --> 53:15.560
Quantum tunneling is one of them.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.880
Yeah, this is like throwing a ping pong ball

53:17.880 --> 53:20.120
like at a piece of paper.

53:20.120 --> 53:21.520
And then every like, you know,

53:21.520 --> 53:23.640
100 of them just like magically show up

53:23.640 --> 53:24.840
on the other side of the paper

53:24.840 --> 53:26.600
without seemingly breaking the paper.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.200
I mean, to use a physical analogy.

53:29.200 --> 53:33.040
And that phenomenized import is critical

53:33.040 --> 53:34.560
for the function of nuclear fusion.

53:34.560 --> 53:36.640
Yes, for all kinds of fusion.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.960
So this is the reason why stars can work as well too.

53:39.960 --> 53:42.000
Like the stars would have to be much,

53:42.000 --> 53:43.720
much hotter actually to be able to,

53:43.720 --> 53:46.880
in fact, it's not clear that they would actually ignite

53:46.880 --> 53:48.800
in fact, without this effect.

53:48.800 --> 53:50.320
And so we get to that.

53:50.320 --> 53:52.880
So this is why there's another requirement.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.120
It's not, so you must make a plasma,

53:55.120 --> 53:57.480
but you also must get it very hot

53:57.480 --> 53:59.200
in order for the reactions to have

53:59.200 --> 54:01.840
a significant probability to actually fuse.

54:01.840 --> 54:03.400
And it actually falls to effectively

54:03.400 --> 54:07.040
almost zero for lower temperatures as well too.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.800
And so there's some nice equation

54:09.800 --> 54:12.680
that gets you to 50 million degrees,

54:12.680 --> 54:17.240
or like, or you said, practically speaking, 100 million.

54:17.240 --> 54:18.520
So it's a really simple equation.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.080
It's the ideal gas law, basically almost.

54:21.080 --> 54:24.240
In the end, you've got a certain number of particle,

54:24.240 --> 54:26.400
of these fusion particles in the plasma state.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.320
They're in the plasma state.

54:27.320 --> 54:29.320
There's a certain number of particles.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.960
And if the confinement is perfect,

54:30.960 --> 54:33.040
if you put in a certain content of energy,

54:33.840 --> 54:37.000
eventually they come up in a temperature

54:37.000 --> 54:40.400
and they go up to high temperature.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.000
This turns out to be, by the way,

54:42.000 --> 54:45.640
extraordinarily small amounts of energy.

54:45.640 --> 54:46.480
And you go, what?

54:46.480 --> 54:49.040
It's like I'm getting something to like 100 million degrees.

54:49.040 --> 54:51.360
That's gonna take the biggest flame burner

54:51.360 --> 54:52.600
that I've ever seen.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.240
No.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.360
And the reason for this is it goes back

54:56.360 --> 54:59.320
to the energy content of this.

54:59.320 --> 55:03.440
So yeah, you have to get it to high average energy,

55:03.440 --> 55:05.840
but there's very, very few particles.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.000
This is low density.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.600
How do you get it to be low density in a reactor?

55:09.600 --> 55:12.200
So the way that you do this is primarily,

55:12.200 --> 55:15.760
again, this is not exactly true in all kinds of fusion,

55:15.760 --> 55:19.600
but in the primary one that we work on magnetic fusion,

55:19.600 --> 55:21.800
this is all happening in a hard vacuum.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.520
So it's like it's happening in outer space.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.160
So basically you've gotten rid of all the other particles,

55:26.160 --> 55:27.800
except for these specialized particles.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.320
So you add them one at a time.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.520
No, actually, it's even easier than that.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.680
You connect a gas valve

55:34.680 --> 55:36.880
and you basically leak gas into it.

55:36.880 --> 55:37.840
In a controlled fashion.

55:37.840 --> 55:38.920
Yeah, yeah.

55:38.920 --> 55:40.120
Oh, this is beautiful.

55:40.120 --> 55:41.640
It's a gas cylinder.

55:41.640 --> 55:43.280
How do you get it from hitting the walls?

55:43.280 --> 55:44.120
Yeah.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.600
So now you've touched on the other necessary requirements.

55:46.600 --> 55:49.360
So it turns out it's not just temperature that's required.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.720
You must also confine it.

55:51.720 --> 55:52.560
So what does this mean?

55:52.560 --> 55:53.380
Confine it.

55:53.380 --> 55:55.040
And there's two types of confinement, as you mentioned.

55:55.040 --> 55:56.080
You mentioned the magnetic one.

55:56.080 --> 55:57.360
Magnetic one.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.920
There's the one called inertial as well too.

55:59.920 --> 56:03.040
But the general principle actually has nothing to do with,

56:03.040 --> 56:06.320
in particular with what the technology is

56:06.320 --> 56:08.160
that you use to confine it.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.320
It's because this goes back to the fact

56:11.320 --> 56:14.320
that the requirement in this is high temperature

56:14.320 --> 56:15.880
and thermal content.

56:15.880 --> 56:18.200
So it's like building a fire.

56:18.200 --> 56:22.920
And what this means is that when you release the energy

56:22.920 --> 56:25.840
into this or apply heat to this,

56:25.840 --> 56:29.320
if it just instantly leaks out, it can never get hot, right?

56:29.320 --> 56:30.600
So you're familiar with this as like,

56:30.600 --> 56:33.720
you've got something that you're trying to apply heat to,

56:33.720 --> 56:36.360
but you're just throwing the heat away very quickly.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.160
This is why we insulate homes, by the way,

56:38.160 --> 56:39.000
and things like this, right?

56:39.000 --> 56:40.920
It's like, you don't want the heat that's coming

56:40.920 --> 56:43.200
into this room to just immediately leave

56:43.200 --> 56:44.520
because you will just start consuming

56:44.520 --> 56:47.080
infinite amounts of heat to try to keep it hot.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.120
So in the end, this is one of the requirements

56:49.120 --> 56:50.600
and it actually has a name.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.920
We call the energy confinement time.

56:52.920 --> 56:55.560
So this means if you release a certain amount of energy

56:55.560 --> 56:58.960
into this fuel, kind of how long,

56:58.960 --> 57:00.480
you sit there and you look at your watch,

57:00.480 --> 57:02.160
how long does it take for this energy

57:02.160 --> 57:03.400
to like leave the system?

57:03.400 --> 57:05.880
So you could imagine that in this room that, you know,

57:05.880 --> 57:08.560
these heaters are putting energy into the air in this room

57:08.560 --> 57:10.040
and you waited for a day,

57:10.040 --> 57:11.840
but all the heat have gone to outside

57:11.840 --> 57:12.840
if I open up the windows.

57:12.840 --> 57:14.440
Oh, there, that's energy confinement time.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.960
Okay, so it's the same concept as that.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.200
So this is an important one.

57:18.200 --> 57:21.440
So all fusion must have confinement.

57:21.440 --> 57:24.200
There's another more esoteric reason for this,

57:24.200 --> 57:29.040
which is that people often confuse temperature and energy.

57:29.040 --> 57:30.120
So what do I mean by that?

57:30.120 --> 57:32.120
So this is literally a temperature,

57:32.120 --> 57:36.240
which means that it is a system in which all the particles,

57:36.240 --> 57:39.640
every particle has high kinetic energy

57:39.640 --> 57:42.240
and is actually in a fully relaxed state,

57:42.240 --> 57:44.080
namely that entropy has been maximized.

57:44.080 --> 57:45.360
That gets a little bit more technical,

57:45.360 --> 57:48.840
but this means that basically it is a thermal system.

57:48.840 --> 57:51.120
So it's like the air in this room, it's like the water,

57:51.120 --> 57:51.960
it's the water in this.

57:51.960 --> 57:53.880
These all have temperatures,

57:53.880 --> 57:56.040
which means that there's a distribution of those energies

57:56.040 --> 57:58.520
because the particles have collided so much that it's there.

57:58.520 --> 58:02.840
So this is distinguished from having high energy particles,

58:02.840 --> 58:04.800
like what we have in like particle accelerators

58:04.800 --> 58:06.280
like CERN and so forth.

58:06.280 --> 58:10.480
Those are high kinetic energy, but it's not a temperature.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.560
So it actually doesn't count as confinement.

58:12.560 --> 58:14.000
So we go through all of those.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.120
You have temperature and then the other requirement,

58:17.120 --> 58:19.720
not too surprising is actually that there has to be

58:19.720 --> 58:22.840
enough density of the fuel.

58:22.840 --> 58:23.680
Enough, but not too much.

58:24.520 --> 58:27.200
Yes, and so in the end,

58:28.080 --> 58:30.120
the way that there's a fancy name for it,

58:30.120 --> 58:31.480
it's called the Lawson Criterion,

58:31.480 --> 58:34.680
because it was formulated by scientists

58:34.680 --> 58:39.280
in the United Kingdom about 1956 or 1957.

58:39.280 --> 58:41.440
And this was essentially the realization,

58:41.440 --> 58:43.000
oh, this is what it's going to take,

58:43.000 --> 58:45.360
regardless of the confinement method.

58:45.360 --> 58:46.960
These are, this is the basic,

58:46.960 --> 58:49.880
what it is actually power balances just says,

58:49.880 --> 58:52.320
oh, there's a certain amount of heat coming in,

58:52.320 --> 58:54.840
which is coming from the fusion reaction itself,

58:54.840 --> 58:57.360
because the fusion reaction heats the fuel

58:58.240 --> 59:00.360
versus how fast you would lose it.

59:00.360 --> 59:02.360
And it basically summarized,

59:02.360 --> 59:04.360
it's summarized by those three parameters,

59:04.360 --> 59:05.360
which are fairly simple.

59:05.360 --> 59:08.440
So temperature, and then the reason we say

59:08.440 --> 59:12.800
a hundred million degrees is because almost always in,

59:12.800 --> 59:15.240
in for this kind of fusion, deuterium tritium fusion,

59:15.240 --> 59:18.440
the minimum in the density and the confinement time product

59:18.440 --> 59:19.600
is at about a hundred million.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.240
So you almost always design your device around that minimum

59:23.240 --> 59:25.640
and then you try to get it contained well enough

59:25.640 --> 59:26.960
and you try to get enough density.

59:26.960 --> 59:31.360
So that temperature thing sounds crazy, right?

59:31.360 --> 59:33.480
That's what we've actually achieved in the laboratory.

59:33.480 --> 59:35.720
Like our experiment here at MIT,

59:35.720 --> 59:38.320
when it ran its optimum configuration,

59:38.320 --> 59:40.440
it was at a hundred million degrees.

59:40.440 --> 59:43.520
But it wasn't actually the product of the density

59:43.520 --> 59:45.640
in the confinement time wasn't sufficient

59:45.640 --> 59:47.760
that we were at a place that we were getting high

59:47.760 --> 59:51.400
net energy gain, but it was making fusion reactions.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.280
So this is the sequence that you go through,

59:53.280 --> 59:56.200
make a plasma, then you get it hot enough.

59:56.200 --> 59:57.360
And when you get it hot enough,

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.520
the fusion reactions start happening so rapidly

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.640
that it's overcoming the rate at which it's leaking heat

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.880
to the outside world.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.640
And at some point it just becomes like a star,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.960
like a sun and our own sun and a star

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.280
doesn't have anything plugged into it.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.600
It's just keeping itself hot

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.120
through its own fusion reactions.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:16.480
In the end, that's really close

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.000
to what a fusion power plant would look like.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.440
What does it visually look like?

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.960
Does it look like, like you said, like purple plasma?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.160
Yeah, actually it's invisible to the eye

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.960
because it's so hot that it's basically emitting light

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.600
in frequencies that we can't detect.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:32.360
It's literal, it's invisible.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.800
In fact, light goes through it,

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.400
visible light goes through it so easy

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.480
that if you were to look at it,

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:40.880
what you would see in our own particular configuration,

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.720
what we make is in the end is a donut shaped,

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.760
it's a vacuum vessel to keep the air out of it.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.960
And when you turn on the plasma,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.560
it gets so hot that most of it just disappears

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.960
in the visible spectrum, you can't see anything.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.800
And there's very, very cold plasma,

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.600
which is between 10 and a hundred thousand degrees,

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.680
which is out in the very periphery of it,

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.120
which is kind of, so the very cold plasma

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.480
is allowed to interact with the,

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.280
kind of has to interact with something eventually

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.200
at the boundary of the vacuum vessel.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.320
And this kind of makes a little halo around it

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.480
and it glows this beautiful purple light basically.

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.040
And these are, that's what we can sense

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:20.520
in the human spectrum.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:25.280
I remember reading on a subreddit called Shower Thoughts,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.680
which people should check out.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.760
It's just fascinating philosophical ideas

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.200
that strike you while you're in the shower.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:36.200
And one of them was, it's lucky that fire, when it burns,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.760
communicates that it's hot using visible light.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.800
Otherwise humans would be screwed.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.520
I don't know if there's a deep, profound truth to that,

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.200
but nevertheless, I did find it on Shower Thoughts subreddit.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:51.040
Actually, I do have, this goes off in a bit of,

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.320
you're right, this is actually, it's interesting.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.640
Cause you know, as a scientist,

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.720
you also think about evolutionary functions

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.680
and how we got, like, why do we have the senses

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.520
that we do?

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.760
It's an interesting question, right?

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.880
Like why can bees see in the ultraviolet and we can't?

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.320
Then you go, well, it's natural selection.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.200
For some reason, this wasn't really particularly

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:08.400
important to us, right?

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.600
Why can't we see in the infrared and other things can?

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.440
It's like, mm-mm.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.440
It's a fascinating question, right?

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.000
Obviously there's some advantage that you have there

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.800
that isn't there, and even color distinguishing, right?

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.120
Of something safe to eat, whatever it would be.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.080
I'll actually go back to this because it's something

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:29.720
that I tell all of my students when I'm teaching

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.840
ionizing radiation and radiological safety.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:35.720
Whatever you say, there's a cultural concern

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.400
or that when people hear the word radiation,

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.440
like what does this mean?

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:43.080
It literally just means light is what it means, right?

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.400
But it's light in different parts of the spectrum, right?

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.240
And so it turns out, besides the visible light

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.920
that we can see here, we are immersed

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.360
in almost the totality of the electromagnetic spectrum.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.040
There is visible light, there's infrared light,

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.080
there is microwaves going around

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.280
as that's how our cell phone works.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.280
You can't, it's way past our detection capability.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.800
But also higher energy ones,

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.520
which has to do with ultraviolet light,

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:13.080
how you get a sunburn and even X-rays and things like this

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.400
at small levels are continually being,

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.360
like from the concrete in the walls of this hotel,

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:20.480
there's X-rays hitting our body continuously.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:23.320
I can bring out, we can go down to the lab at MIT,

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.760
you can bring out a detector and show you.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.920
Every single room will have these.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.120
By our body, you mean the 10 to the 28 atoms.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.480
Yeah, the 10 to the 28 atoms and they're coming in

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.440
and they're interacting with those things.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.520
And those, particularly the ones where the light

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:39.680
is at higher average energy per light particle,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.120
those are the ones that can possibly have an effect

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:43.280
on human health.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:46.560
So we, it's interesting, humans and all animals

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:49.640
have evolved on earth where we're immersed

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.600
in that all the time.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.560
There's natural source of radiation all the time,

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.600
yet we have zero ability to detect it, like zero.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.360
Yeah, and our ability, cognitive ability

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.360
to filter it all out and not give a damn.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.160
It would probably overwhelm us actually

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.000
if we could see all of it.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.760
But my main point is it goes back to your thing

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.480
about fire and self-protection.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.480
If ionizing radiation was such a critical aspect

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.840
of the health of organisms on earth,

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.920
we would almost certainly have evolved methods

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.960
to detect it and we have none.

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.240
And yes.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.720
The physical world that's all around us is incredible.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:26.480
You're blowing my mind, Dr. Dennis White.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.000
Okay, let's, so you have experience

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.160
with magnetic confinement, you have experience

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.120
with inertial confinement.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.520
Most of your work has been in magnetic confinement,

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.520
but let's sort of talk about the sexy recent thing

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:41.400
for a bit of a time.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.400
There's been a breakthrough in the news

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.240
that laser-based inertial confinement was used

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.280
by DOE's National Ignition Facility

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.760
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.080
Can you explain this breakthrough that happened in December?

01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.080
Yeah.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.320
So it goes to the set of criteria that I talked about

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.720
before about getting high energy gain.

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.440
So in the end, what are we after in fusion

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:13.440
is that we basically assemble this plasma fuel in some way

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.320
and we provide it a starting amount of energy.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.280
Think of lighting the fire.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.560
And what you want to do is get back

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.240
like significant excess gain from the fact

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.200
that the fusion is releasing the energy.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.320
So it's like the equivalent of like,

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.080
we want to have a match, a small match, light a fire,

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.360
and then the fire keeps us hot.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.400
It's like, it's very much like that.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.800
So as I said, we've made many of the,

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.640
and what do we mean by we?

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.920
It's like the fusion community has pursued aspects of this

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.840
through a variety of different confinement methodologies

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.200
is that the key part about what happens,

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.960
what was the threshold we had never gotten over before

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.240
was that if you only consider the plasma fuel,

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.680
not the total engineering system,

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.760
but just the plasma fuel itself,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.440
we had not gotten to the point yet

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.720
where basically the size of the match

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.720
was smaller than the amount of energy

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.560
that we got from the fusion.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:15.800
Is there a good term for when the output

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.160
is greater than the input?

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.800
Yes, yes, there is.

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.600
Well, there's several special definitions of this.

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.320
So one of them is that if you like in a fire,

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.560
if you light a match and you have it there

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.880
and it's an infinitesimal amount of energy

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.640
compared to what you're getting out of the fire,

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.400
we call this ignition, which makes sense, right?

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.440
This is like what our own sun is as well too.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.080
So that was not ignition in that sense as well too.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.120
So what we call this the scientific,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.720
what the one that I just talked about,

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.800
which is for some instance,

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.560
when I get enough fusion energy released

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.800
compared to the size of the match,

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.280
we call this scientific breakeven.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.800
Breakeven.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.560
And it's because you've gotten past the fact

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.000
that this is unity now at this point.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.200
What is a fusion gain or as using the notation Q

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.160
from the paper overview of the Spark Takamak

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.760
before using just the same kind of term?

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:09.880
Yeah, actually, so sorry,

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.640
the technical term is Q, capital Q.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.440
Oh, so people actually use Q.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.800
We actually use capital Q or sometimes it's called Q.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.640
So Q is taken.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.760
Q sub P or something like this.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.960
Okay, so this is, which means that what it means

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.400
is that it's in the plasma.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.960
So all we're considering is the energy balance

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.440
or gain that comes from the plasma itself.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.840
We're not considering the technologies which are around it,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.280
which are providing the containment and so forth.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.640
So why the excitement and so forth?

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.480
Well, because for one reason,

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:44.000
it's a rather simple threshold to get over

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.160
to understand that you're getting more energy

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.200
out from the fusion, even the theoretical sense

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.120
than you were from the starting match.

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.360
Do you mean conceptually simple?

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.560
It's conceptually simple that you get past one,

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.400
that everyone under, like when you're less than one,

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.600
that's much less interesting than getting past one.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:03.840
So there's a really big threshold to get past.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.600
But it really is a scientific threshold

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.240
because what QP actually denotes

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.720
is the relative amount of self-heating

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:17.200
that's happening in the plasma.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:19.680
So what I mean by this is that in the end,

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:24.680
in these systems, what you want is something

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.800
that where the relative amount of heating,

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.560
which is keeping the fuel hot is dominated

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.000
by from the fusion reactions themselves.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.840
And so it becomes, it's sort of like thinking

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.760
like a bonfire is a lot more interesting physically

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.360
than just holding a blowtorch to a wet log, right?

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:45.600
There's a lot more dynamics.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.120
It's a lot more self-evolved and so forth.

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:50.800
And what we're excited as scientists

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.640
is that it's clear that the, in that experiment,

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.080
that they actually got to a point

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.960
where the fusion reactions themselves

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.720
were actually altering the state of the plasma.

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.880
It's like, wow, I mean, we'd seen it in glimpses before

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.560
in magnetic confinement at relatively small levels,

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.840
but apparently it seems like in this experiment,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:14.800
it's likely to be a dominant, dominated by self-heating.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.440
That's a very important, that's a very-

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.480
So that makes it a self-sustaining type of-

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.720
It's more self-sustaining,

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.440
it's more self-referential system in a sense,

01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.400
and it sort of self-evolves in a way.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.640
Again, it's not that it's gonna evolve to a dangerous state,

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.000
it's just that we want to see what happens

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.760
when the fusion is the dominant heating source.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.680
And we'll talk about that,

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.320
but there's also another element,

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.640
which is the inertial confinement,

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.040
laser-based inertial confinement.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.680
It's kind of a little bit of an underdog.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.600
So a lot of the broad nuclear fusion community

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.360
has been focused on magnetic confinement.

01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.040
Can you explain just how laser-based

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.160
inertial confinement works?

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.160
So it says 192 laser beams

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:59.840
were aligned on a deuterium-tradium-DT target

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.440
smaller than a P.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.880
Yes.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:03.720
This is like-

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:04.560
It's more like a BB actually, yeah.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:08.200
Well, it depends, not all P's are made the same.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.840
But this is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.680
from a pitch,

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.520
this is like a journalist wrote this, I think.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.000
This is like, oh no, it's not a journalist,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.320
it's DOE wrote this, Department of Energy.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.040
We try to use all these analogies.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.320
This is like throwing a perfect strike in baseball

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:27.080
from a pitcher's mount 350 miles away from the plate.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.920
There you go.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.360
Department of Energy.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.760
The United States Department of Energy wrote this.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.520
Can you explain what the lasers-

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.360
What actually happens?

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.680
Yeah, actually there's usually mass confusion about this.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.120
So what's going on in this form of energy?

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.840
So the fuel is delivered in a discreet,

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.080
the fusion fuel, the deuterium and tritium,

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.640
is in a discreet spherical, it's more like a BB,

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.480
let's call it a BB.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.800
So it's a small one.

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.320
And all the fuel that you're gonna try to burn

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320
is basically there.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.600
And it's about that size.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.000
So how are you going to get-

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.920
And it's at, literally it's like at 20 degrees

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.360
above absolute zero because the deuterium and tritium

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:11.760
are kept in a liquid and solid state.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:14.040
Oh wow, so the fuel is injected not as a gas,

01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.280
but as a solid.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:18.360
It's actually, and these are particular experiments

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:21.440
that can introduce one of these targets

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.720
once per day approximately, something like that.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.000
Cause it's very, it's kind of amazing technology actually

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.520
that I know some of the people that worked on this

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:34.000
back in the day is they actually make these things

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.680
at a BB size of this frozen fuel,

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.800
it's actually at cryogenic temperatures.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.920
And they're almost like smooth to the atom level.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.200
I mean, they're amazing pieces of technology.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:48.040
So what you do in the end is think you,

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.040
what you have is a spherical assembly of this fuel,

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.200
like a ball.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.200
And what is the purpose of the lasers?

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:59.360
The purpose of the lasers is to provide optical energy

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.840
to the very outside of this.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.080
And what happens is that energy is absorbed

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.720
because it's in the solid phase of matter.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.880
So it's absorbed really in the surface.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.360
And then what happens is that when it's absorbed

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:16.000
in something called the ablator, what does that mean?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.560
It means it goes instantly from the solid phase

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.680
to the gas phase.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.080
So it becomes like a rocket engine,

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.760
but you hit it like very uniformly.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.680
So all there's like rocket engines coming off the surface.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:31.320
Think of like an asteroid almost,

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.720
where there's like rockets coming off all this thing.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.560
So what does that do?

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.640
Well, what does a rocket do?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.760
It actually pushes by Newton's laws, right?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:41.040
It pushes the other thing on the other side of it,

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.680
equal and opposite reaction.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.080
It pushes it in.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.080
So what it does is that the lasers actually don't heat.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:49.520
This is what was confusing.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:50.560
People think the lasers,

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.600
oh, we're gonna get it to a hundred million degrees.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.360
In fact, you want the exact opposite of this.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.320
What you want to do is get essentially a rocket

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.680
going out like this.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.240
And then what happens is that the sphere like,

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.280
and this is happening in a billionth of a second

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.840
or less actually,

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.840
this rapidly, that force like so rapidly compresses the fuel

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:12.840
that what happens is that you're squeezing down on it.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.200
And you know, it's like, what was the,

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.000
see BB, that's bad actually BB.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.040
I should have started with a basketball.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:24.080
Goes from like a basketball down to something like this

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080
and a billionth of a second.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:30.080
And when that happens, I mean, scale that in your mind.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:33.720
So when that happens and in this comes from

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.000
almost from classical physics.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So there's some quantum in it as well too.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.320
But basically if you can do this like very uniformly

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.520
and so-called adiabatically,

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.480
like you're not actually heating the fuel.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.440
What happens is you get adiabatic compression

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.320
such that the very center of this thing

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.960
all of a sudden just spikes up in temperature

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.320
because it's actually done so fast.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.480
So why is it called inertial fusion?

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.760
It's because you're doing this on such fast timescales

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.520
that the inertia of the hot fuel basically is still finite.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.440
So it can't like push itself apart

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.640
before the fusion happens.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:09.600
Oh, wow.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.440
So how do you make it so fast?

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.000
This is why you use lasers

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.960
because you're applying this energy

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.080
in very, very short periods of time,

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.840
like under a fraction of a billionth of a second.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.960
And so basically that, and then the force,

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.000
which is coming from this comes from the energy

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:29.520
of the lasers, which is basically the rocket action,

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:30.840
which does the compression.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:34.840
So is the force, is the inward facing force,

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.960
is that increasing the temperature exponentially?

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.960
You wanna keep the fuel cold

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:43.240
and then just literally just ideally compress it.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.600
And then in something which is at the very center

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.440
of that compressed sphere,

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.440
because you've compressed it so rapidly,

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.960
the laws of physics basically require

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.640
for it to increase in temperature.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.480
So the change in temperature.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.920
The effect is like, if you know the thing,

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.600
so adiabatic cooling, we're actually fairly familiar with.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:03.000
If you take a spray can, right, and you push the button,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.840
when it rapidly expands, it cools.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:08.040
This is the nature of a lot of cooling technology

01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.120
we use actually.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.280
Well, the opposite is true

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.160
that if you would take all of those particles

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.520
and jam them together very fast back in,

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:15.520
they wanna heat up.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.240
And that's what happens.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:21.120
And then what happens is you basically have this

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.600
very cold compressed set of fusion fuel.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.280
And at the center of this,

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.720
it goes to this hundred million degrees Celsius.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.160
And so if it gets to that hundred million degrees Celsius,

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.360
the fusion fuel starts to burn.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.200
And when that fusion fuel starts to burn,

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.520
it wants to heat up the other cold fuel around it.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.640
And it just basically propagates out so fast

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:43.640
that what you would do ideally,

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.840
you would actually burn in a fusion sense,

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.040
most of the fuel that's in the pellet.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.240
So this was very exciting because what they had done

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.240
was it's clear that they propagated this,

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:56.480
they got this what they call a hotspot.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:57.720
And in fact, that this heating

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.920
had propagated out into the fuel.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.920
And that's the science behind inertial fusion.

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.880
So the idea behind a reactor

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.080
that's based on this kind of inertial confinement

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.240
is that you would have a new BB every like-

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.760
10 times a second or something like this.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.200
And that there's some kind of,

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.720
so there's a incredible device that you kind of implied

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.120
that kind of has to create one of those BBs that-

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.800
So you have to make the BBs very fast.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.880
There's reports on this, but about what does it mean?

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.960
The starting point is, can you make this gain?

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.160
So this was a scientific achievement primarily because-

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.600
And the rest is just engineering.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:39.320
No, no, no, the rest is incredibly complicated engineering.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:41.840
Well, in fact, there's still physics hurdles to overcome.

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:43.760
So where does this come from?

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.600
And it's actually because if you want to make

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.320
an energy source out of this,

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:50.520
this had a gain of around 1.5,

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:53.320
that namely the fusion energy was approximately,

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.480
was 1.5 times the laser input energy.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.760
Okay, this is a fairly significant threshold.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:01.920
However, from the science of what I just told you

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.400
is that there's two fundamental efficiencies

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.920
which come into it, which really come from physics really.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.040
One of them is hydrodynamic efficiency.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:11.360
What I mean by this is that it's a rocket.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:16.360
So this just has a fundamental efficiency built into it,

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.000
which comes out to orders of like 10%.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.920
So this means is that your ability to do work

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.560
on the system is just limited by that, okay?

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.920
And then the other one is the efficiency

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:28.320
of laser systems themselves,

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.960
which if their wall plug efficiency is 10%,

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.800
you've done spectacularly well.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:35.080
In fact, the wall plug efficiency of the ones

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.040
using that experiments are like more like 1%, right?

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.800
So when you go through all of this,

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:42.920
the approximate place that you're ordering this

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:48.080
for a fusion power plant would be a gain of 100, not 1.5.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.320
So you still, and hopefully we see experiments

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:53.920
that keep climbing up towards higher and higher gain.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.920
But then the whole fusion power plant

01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.480
is a totally different thing.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.480
So it's not one BB and one laser pulse per day.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:07.000
It's like five or 10 times per second,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.320
like like that, right?

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.040
So you're doing it there.

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.520
And then comes the other aspect.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.240
So it's making the targets, delivering them,

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.640
being able to repeatedly get them to burn.

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.200
And then we haven't even talked about like,

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.520
how do you then get the fusion energy out?

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.800
Which is mainly because these things

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.240
are basically micro implosions which are occurring.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:33.040
So this energy is coming out to some medium on the outside

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:33.880
that you've got to figure out

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:36.040
how to extract the energy out of this thing.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.280
How do you convert that energy to electricity?

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.640
So in the end, you have to basically

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.200
convert it into heat in some way.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.960
So in the end, what fusion makes mostly

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.560
is like very energetic particles from the fusion reaction.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.480
So you have to slow those down in some way

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:53.920
and then make heat out of it.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.360
So basically the conversion of the kinetic energy

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.840
of the particles into heating some engineered material

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.280
that's on the outside of this.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:04.080
And that's from a physics perspective

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.360
is a somewhat solved problem,

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:09.480
but from an engineering is still quite open.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.040
Physics, I can show you all the equations

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.680
that tell you about how it slows down

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.560
and converts kinetic energy into heat.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.600
And then what that heat means,

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.560
you can write out like an ideal thermal cycle,

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.400
like a Carnot cycle.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.960
So the physics of that, yeah, great.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.560
The integrated engineering of this is a whole other thing.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:28.360
I'll ask you to maybe talk about the difference

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.480
between inertial and magnetic,

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.760
but first we'll talk about magnetic.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.640
But let me just linger on this breakthrough.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.080
It's nice to have exciting things,

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:38.200
but in a deep human sense,

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:40.480
there's no competition in science and engineering.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:42.720
Or like you said, we were broad.

01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:45.160
First of all, we are humanity altogether.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:46.040
And you talk about this,

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:47.640
it's a bunch of countries collaborating.

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.480
It's really exciting.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:52.280
There's a nuclear fusion community broadly,

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.800
but then there's also MIT.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.000
There's colors and logos and it's exciting.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.880
And you have friends and colleagues here

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.560
that work extremely hard and done some incredible stuff.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.320
Is there some sort of,

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.160
how do you feel seeing somebody else get a breakthrough

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.920
and using a different technology?

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.600
Is that exciting?

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.720
Is this the competitive fire?

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:16.720
All of the above.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.800
I mean, the ignition.

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.080
I have, just to wave the flag a little bit.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:28.080
So MIT was a central player in this accomplishment.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.120
Interesting, I'd say it showed our two,

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.400
some of our two best traits.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.880
So one of them was that the,

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.920
like how do you know that this happened?

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:39.160
This measurement, right?

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.160
So one of the ways to do this is if I told you

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.440
is that in the DT fusion,

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:48.000
what it actually, the product that comes out is helium.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
We call it alpha, but it's helium.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.200
And a free neutron, right?

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.000
So the neutron contains 80% of the energy released

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.400
by the fusion reaction.

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.080
And it also, because it lacks a charge,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.680
it basically tends to just escape and go flying out.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:05.680
So this is what we would use eventually for,

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.520
that's mostly what fusion energy would be.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.360
But so what my colleagues, my scientific colleagues

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.960
at the plasma science and fusion center built

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.840
were extraordinary measurement tools

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:19.160
of being able to see the exact details

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.840
of not only the number of neutrons that were coming out,

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.320
but actually what energy that they're at.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.640
And by looking at that configuration,

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.760
it reveals enormous, I'm not gonna scoop them

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.120
because they need to publish the paper,

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:35.680
but it reveals enormous amounts of scientific information

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:37.320
about what's happening in that process

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.400
that I just described.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.720
So, I mean, and I have colleagues there

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:46.160
that have worked like for 30 years on this for that moment.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.680
Of course you're excited for them, right?

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.200
I mean, and there's one of those,

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.600
like there is nothing, it's hard to describe

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.840
to people who aren't, it's like almost addicting

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.760
to be a scientist when you get to be at the forefront

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:00.280
of research of anything.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.120
Like when you see like an actual discovery of some kind

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:04.960
and you're looking at it,

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.160
particularly when you're the person who did it, right?

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.600
And you go, no human being has ever seen this

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.600
or understood this.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.960
It's like, it's pretty thrilling, right?

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.680
So even in proxy, it's incredibly thrilling to see this.

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.680
It's not, I don't wanna say it's rivalry or jealousy.

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:23.880
It's like, I can tell you already, fusion is really hard.

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.600
So anything that keeps pushing the needle forward

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.640
is a good thing.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.120
But we also have to be realistic about what it means

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.920
to making a fusion energy system.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.760
That's the-

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.080
And then, but that's the fun.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.320
I mean, these are still the early steps.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.080
Maybe you can say the early leaps.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.800
So let's talk about the magnetic confinement.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:46.920
What is, how does magnetic confinement work?

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:47.960
What's the TACOMAC?

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.160
Yeah, how does it all work?

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.000
So go back to that.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.640
So why inertial confinement works on the same principle

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.560
that a star works.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:58.920
So like, what is the confinement mechanism in the star

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:03.920
is gravity because it's own inertia

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.640
of something the size of the sun

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:09.880
basically pushes literally a force by gravity

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:11.200
against the center.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:14.800
So the center is very, very hot, 20 million degrees.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:16.960
And literally outside the sun, it's essentially zero

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.800
because it's vacuum of space.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.160
How the hell does that do that?

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.840
It does that by, and it's out of,

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.640
like why doesn't it just leak all of its heat?

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:27.560
It doesn't leak its heat because it all is held together

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.360
by the fact that it can't escape because of its own gravity.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.040
So this is why the fusion happens in the center of the star.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.200
Like we think of the surface of the sun as being hot.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.080
That's the coldest part of the star.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.520
So if our own sun, this is about in 5,500 degrees,

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.400
a beautiful symmetry by the way, it's like,

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.600
so how do we know all this?

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.040
Because we can't of course see directly

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:48.280
into the interior of the sun by knowing the volume

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:50.160
and the temperature of the surface of the sun.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.320
You know exactly how much power it's putting out.

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.400
And by this, you know that this is coming

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.960
from fusion reactions occurring at exactly the same rate

01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.280
in the middle of the sun.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.560
Is it possible as a small tangent

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.560
to build an inertial confinement system like the sun?

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.440
Is it possible to create a sun?

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.200
It is of course possible to make a sun,

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:12.760
otherwise you wouldn't have stars,

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.560
but it is not impossible on earth

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.320
because for the simple reason that it takes,

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:19.600
the gravitational force is extremely weak.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.560
And so it takes something like the size of a star

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.200
to make fusion occur in the center.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.040
Well, I didn't mean on earth.

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.880
I mean, if you had to build like a second sun,

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:29.720
how'd you do it?

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.360
You can't, there's not enough hydrogen around.

01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.880
So the limiting factor is just the hydrogen.

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.960
Yeah, I mean, the forces and energy that it takes

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.800
to assemble that is just mind boggling.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.640
All right, to be continued.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.480
Yeah, to be continued.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.600
So what are we doing it with?

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600
So in the one that I just described, it's like you say,

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.680
so you have to replace this with some force,

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:52.600
which is better than that.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:56.160
And so what I mean by that, it's stronger than that.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.520
So what I talked about the laser fusion,

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.880
this is coming from the force,

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.760
which is enormous compared to gravity,

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.240
like from the rocket action of pushing it together.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.880
So in magnetic confinement, we use another force of nature,

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.080
which is the electromagnetic force.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.480
And that's very, it's orders and orders of magnitude

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:16.640
stronger than the gravitational force.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.320
And the key force that matters here

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.320
is that if you have a charged particle,

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.480
that namely it's a particle that has an electric,

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:25.160
net electric charge,

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:28.040
and it's in the proximity of a magnetic field,

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:31.640
then there is a force which is exerted on that particle.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.960
So it's called the Lorentz force

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.640
for those who are keeping track.

01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:38.000
So that is the force that we use

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.600
to replace physical containment.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:44.360
So this again, how do you hold something

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.800
at a hundred million degrees?

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.360
It's impossible in a physical container.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:49.760
This is not like, you know,

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.520
it's not this plastic bottle holding in this liquid

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.360
or a gas chamber.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.240
What you're doing is you're using,

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.440
you're immersing the fuel in a magnetic field

01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.360
that basically exerts a force at a distance.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:03.800
This comes back again to again,

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.800
like why plazas are so strange.

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.960
It's the same thing here.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.760
And if it's immersed in this magnetic field,

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.880
you're not actually physically touching it,

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.200
but you're making a force go onto it.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:18.200
So that's the inherent feature of magnetic confinement.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:20.680
And then magnetic confinement devices

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.240
are like a tokamak are basically configurations

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.720
which exploit the features of that magnetic containment.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:28.840
There's several features to it.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.000
One is that the stronger the strength of the magnetic field,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.200
the stronger the force.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.400
And for this reason is that if you increase

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:38.520
the strength of magnetic fields,

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:40.480
this means that the containment,

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.400
because namely the force which you're pushing against it

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.120
is more effective.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.000
And the other feature is that there is no force.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.080
So for those who remember magnetic fields,

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:50.920
what are all these things?

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.600
They're also invisible.

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.680
But if you think of a permanent magnets

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.440
or your fridge magnet, there are field lines

01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.120
which we actually designate as arrows,

01:26:59.120 --> 01:26:59.960
which are going around.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.800
You sometimes see this in school

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.880
when you have the iron filings on a thing

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:07.560
and you see the directions of the magnetic field lines

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.560
or when you use a compass, right?

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.200
So that's telling you in the world

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:13.880
because we're living in an immersed magnetic field

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:16.960
made by the earth, which is that very low intensity magnetic

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.800
but it's strong enough

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.440
we can actually see what direction is it.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:22.240
So this is the arrow that the magnetic field is pointing.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:25.320
It's always pointing north and for us is that.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.200
So an interesting feature of this force

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:28.640
is that there is no force

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:31.040
along the direction of the magnetic field.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.320
There's only force in the directions orthogonal

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.800
to the magnetic field.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.000
So this by the way is a huge deal

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.880
in a whole other discipline of plasma physics

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.200
which is like the study of like our near atmosphere.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:46.320
So the study of aurora borealis,

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.880
what's happening in the near atmosphere,

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:50.040
what happens when solar flares hit the magnetic.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:53.960
In fact, remember I said fusion is the reason

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.000
that life is responsible in the universe.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.520
We could also argue so is magnetic confinement

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:03.360
because the charged particles which are being emitted

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.880
from the galaxy and from our own star

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:09.840
would be very, very damaging on earth.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.880
So we get two layers of protection.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.720
One is the atmosphere itself

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.560
but the other one is the magnetic field

01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:16.880
which just surrounds the earth

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.960
and basically traps these charged particles

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.800
so they can't get away.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:21.880
It's the same, it's the same, it's the same deal.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.720
How do you create a strong magnetic field?

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.680
Yeah, so.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.760
With a giant magnet.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.080
Giant magnet, yeah.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:30.640
So it's basically true.

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:31.480
Engineering is awesome.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.920
There's essentially two ways to create a magnet.

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.720
So one of them is that we're familiar

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.200
with like fridge magnets and so forth.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.120
These are so-called permanent magnets

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:41.320
and what it means is that within these,

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:43.000
the atoms arrange in a particular way

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:44.400
that it produces the electrons

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.560
basically arrange in a particular way

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:48.880
that it produces a permanent magnetic field

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:50.440
that is set by the material.

01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.640
So those have a fundamental limitation

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:56.800
how strong they can be and they also tend to have this

01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.440
like circular shape like this.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.080
So we don't typically use those.

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.360
So what we use are so-called electromagnets.

01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.200
And what is this?

01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:06.920
It's like, so the other way to make a magnetic field

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:11.200
is to also go back to your elementary school physics

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.360
or science class is that you take a nail

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.000
and you wrap a copper wire around it

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
and connect it to a battery.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.840
Then it can pick up iron filings.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.120
This is an electromagnet.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.520
And it's simplest what it is.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.360
It's an electric current, which is going in a pattern

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.120
around and around and around.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.400
And what this does is it produces a magnetic field

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:32.560
which goes through it by the laws of electromagnetism.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.480
So that's what an electric,

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.600
so that's how we make the magnetic field

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.040
in these configurations.

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.560
And the key there is that it's not limited

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.440
by the magnetic property of the material.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.880
The magnetic field amplitude is set

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:50.520
by the amount of the geometry of this thing

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.000
and the amount of electric current

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.120
that you're putting through.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.520
And the more electric current that you put through,

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.520
the more magnetic field that you get.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:00.880
The closest one that people maybe see

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:05.360
is one of my favorite skits actually

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:09.360
was Super Dave Osborne on, it's probably past,

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.080
he was in a show called Bizarre, Super Dave Osborne,

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.920
which is a great comedian called, he was a stunt man.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.760
And one of his tricks was that he gets into a car

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.560
and then one of those things in the junkyard comes down

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.480
and picks up the car and then puts it into the crusher.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.560
This is his stunt, which is pretty hilarious.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:28.760
Anyway, but that thing that picks him up,

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.640
how does that work?

01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.480
That's actually not a permanent magnet,

01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.160
it's an electromagnet.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.280
And so you can turn, by turning off and on the power supply,

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.400
it turns off and on the magnetic field.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.040
So this means you can pick it up

01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.600
and then when you switch it off,

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.800
the magnetic field goes away and the car drops.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.480
Okay, so that's what it looks like.

01:30:46.480 --> 01:30:48.000
Speaking of giant magnets,

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.080
MIT and Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS,

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.560
built a very large high temperature

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:58.040
superconducting electromagnet

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.200
that was ramped up to a field strength of 20 Tesla,

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.320
the most powerful magnetic field of its kind

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.760
ever created on earth.

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:07.760
Because I enjoy this kind of thing,

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.320
can you please tell me about this magnet?

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.760
Yeah, sure.

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.960
Oh, it was, it's fun, yeah.

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.200
There's a lot to parse there.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.480
So maybe, so we already explained an electromagnet,

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.960
which in general is what you do is you take electric current

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.000
and you force it to follow a pattern of some kind,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.880
typically like a circular pattern.

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:29.560
Around and around and around and around

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.520
and it goes the more time,

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.440
the more current and the more times it goes around,

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:35.400
the stronger the magnetic field that you make of it.

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:36.440
And as I pointed out,

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.120
it's like really important in magnetic confinement

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.960
because it is the force that's produced by that magnet.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.560
In fact, technically it goes like the magnetic field squared

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:48.560
because it's a pressure which is actually being exerted

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.600
on the plasma to keep it contained.

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.000
Just so we know, for magnetic confinement,

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.240
what is usually the geometry of the magnet?

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:58.800
What are we supposed to imagine?

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.520
Yeah, so the geometry is typically is what you do is

01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.240
you want to produce a magnetic field

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:07.280
that loops back on itself.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.720
And the reason for this was,

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:12.440
goes down to the nature of the force that I described,

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:17.480
which is that there's no containment or force

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.000
along the direction of the magnetic field.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.360
So here's a magnetic field.

01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:24.080
In fact, what it's more technically

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.600
or more graphically what it's doing is that

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:29.720
when the plasma is, here's plasma particles here,

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:31.240
here's a magnetic field,

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.240
what it does is it forces all those,

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:35.680
because of this Lorentz force,

01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.000
it makes all of those charged particles execute circular

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.440
orbits around the magnetic field.

01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.960
And they go around like this,

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:46.520
but they stream freely along the magnetic field line.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.480
So this is why the nature of the containment is that

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:51.720
if you can get that circle smaller and smaller,

01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:56.000
it stays further away from earth, temperature materials.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.880
That's why the confinement gets better.

01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:00.560
But the problem is, is that because it freestreams along,

01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:03.400
so we just have a long straight magnetic field.

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:06.720
Okay, it'll just keep leaking out the ends like really fast.

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:07.960
So you get rid of the ends.

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.520
So you basically loop it back around.

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:13.320
So what these look like are typically donut shaped

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.640
or more technically toroidal shape,

01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:19.800
but donut shaped things where this collection

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:21.960
of magnetic fields loops back on itself.

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.440
And it also for reasons which are more complicated

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:28.680
to explain, basically it also twists slowly around

01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:30.520
in this direction as well too.

01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.000
So that's what it looks like.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.560
That's what the plasma looks like,

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.320
because that's what the fuel looks like.

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.160
So then this means is that the electromagnets are configured

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.720
in such a way that it produces

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.200
the desired magnetic fields around this.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.040
So they-

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:45.880
How precise does this have to be?

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:47.880
You were probably listening to our conversation

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:49.440
with some of my colleagues yesterday.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.520
So it's actually, it depends on the configuration

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:54.320
about how you're doing it.

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.120
The configuration of the electromagnets

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.520
and about how you're achieving this requirement.

01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:05.000
It's fairly precise, but it doesn't have to be,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:06.520
particularly in something like a tokamak,

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:08.960
what we do is we produce planar coils,

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:12.000
which just mean they're flat and we situate them.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.680
So if you think of a circle like this,

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.600
what does it produce?

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.680
If you put current through it,

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:19.160
it produces a magnetic field

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.720
which goes through the circle like this.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.680
So if you align many of them like this, this, this, this,

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.800
there's things online, you can go see the picture.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.600
You keep arranging these around in a circle itself,

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.200
this forces the magnetic field lines

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.600
to basically just keep executing around like this.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.800
So you tend to align.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.560
That one tends to, while it requires good alignment,

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.320
it's not like insane alignment

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.120
because you're actually exploiting the symmetry

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.200
of the situation to help it.

01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.600
There's another kind of configuration of magnetic,

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.000
of this kind of magnetic confinement called a stellarator,

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.800
which is, we have these names for historic reasons.

01:34:56.800 --> 01:34:58.080
Which is different than a tokamak.

01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.120
It's different than a tokamak,

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.960
but actually works on the same physical principle

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.240
that namely in the end it produces a plasma

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.000
which loops in magnetic fields,

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.400
which loop back on themselves as well.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.560
But in that case, the totality, basically the totality

01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.760
of the confining magnetic field is produced

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.200
by external three-dimensional magnets.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.200
So they're twisted.

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:23.080
And it turns out the precision of those is more stringent.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.840
So are tokamaks by far more popular

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.280
for research and development currently than stellarators?

01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:30.720
Of the concepts which are there,

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.280
the tokamak is by far the most mature

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.120
in terms of its breadth of performance

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.040
and thinking about how it would be applied

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.640
in a fusion energy system.

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:43.360
And the history of this was that many,

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.600
in fact, you asked about this,

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.520
if we go back to the history

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.400
of the plasma science and fusion center,

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:50.600
the history of fusion is that people,

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.440
scientists had started to work on this in the 1950s.

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:57.120
It was all hush-hush and cold war and all that kind of stuff.

01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.680
And it's like, they realized, holy cow,

01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:01.400
this is really hard.

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.400
We actually don't really know what we're doing in this

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400
because everything was at low temperatures.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.240
They couldn't get confinement.

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:09.080
It was interesting.

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.960
And then they declassified it.

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:13.480
And this is one of the few places

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.920
that the West and the Soviet Union

01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:17.960
actually collaborated on was the science of this.

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:18.800
Even during the cold war.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.280
Even during the middle of the cold war, it was really,

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.040
and this actually perpetuates all the way to now

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.760
for we can talk about the project

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.600
that that is sort of captured in now.

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.560
But in the reason they declassified it

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.240
was because everything kind of sucked basically

01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.840
about trying to make this confinement

01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.760
and high temperature plasma.

01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:46.000
And then the Russians, then the Soviets,

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.760
came along with this device called a tokamak,

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.400
which is a Russian acronym,

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.160
which basically means magnetic coils arranged

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:56.040
in the shape of a donut.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:00.760
And they said, holy cow,

01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:03.400
like everyone was stuck at like a meager,

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.840
like half a million degrees,

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:06.680
or half a million degrees,

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.680
which is like infusion terms of zero basically.

01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.240
And then they come along and they say,

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.080
oh, we've actually achieved a temperature

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.400
20 times higher than everybody else.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.320
And it's actually started to make fusion reactions.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:20.040
And everyone just go, oh, you know, no way.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.080
It's just hype from this.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.200
It's like, there's no way,

01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.680
because we've failed at this.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:26.800
It's a great story in the history of fusion

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.480
is that then, but they insisted and said,

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:30.160
no, look, you can see this from our data.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.080
It's like, this thing is really hot

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080
and it seems to be working.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.320
This is, you know, late 1960s.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:38.680
And there was a team that went

01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:41.440
in the United Kingdom's fusion development lab.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.640
And they brought this very fancy,

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.360
amazing new technology called a laser.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.160
And they use this laser and they shot the laser beam

01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.720
like through the plasma.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.320
And by looking at the scattered light that came from it,

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.720
they go, basically the scattered light

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:01.360
gets more broadened in its spectrum if it gets hotter.

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:03.920
So you could exactly tell the temperature of this.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:06.080
And even though you're not physically touching the plasma,

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.320
it's like, holy cow, you're right.

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.400
It is like, it is 10 million degrees.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.120
And so this was one of those explosions

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.240
of like everyone in the world then wanted to build a tokamak

01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.320
because it was clearly like, wow,

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:23.280
this is like so far ahead of everything else

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.440
that we tried before.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.840
So that actually has a part of the story to MIT

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.360
and the Plasma Science and Fusion Center was,

01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:32.880
why is there a strong fusion

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.160
and a major fusion program at MIT?

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.320
It was because we were host

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.320
to the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory,

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:42.480
which is also the National High Field Magnet Laboratory.

01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.080
Well, you can see where this goes, right?

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:46.280
From this, we're kind of telling the stories

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:51.280
backwards almost, but the advent of a tokamak

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.600
along with the fact that you could make

01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:57.000
some very strong magnetic fields with the technology

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:58.960
that had been developed at that laboratory,

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.720
that was the origins of sort of pushing together

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:04.400
the physics of the plasma containment

01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:07.520
and the magnet technology and put them together

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:09.920
in a way that I would say is a very typical

01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.480
MIT success story, right?

01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:14.680
We don't do just pure science or pure technology.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.560
We sort of set up this intersection between them.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.480
And there were several pioneers of people at MIT,

01:39:21.480 --> 01:39:23.000
like Bruno Cappi, who's a professor

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.960
in the physics department and Ron Parker,

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.240
who was a professor in electrical engineering

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:28.320
and nuclear engineering.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.200
It's like even the makeup of the people, right?

01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:33.080
Has got this blends of science and engineering in them.

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.320
And that's actually was the origin

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:35.800
of the Plymouth Science and Fusion Center

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:36.920
was doing those things.

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.200
So anyway, so back to this.

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:41.160
So why, so yes, tokamaks have been,

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:44.000
have achieved the highest in magnetic fusion by far,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.640
like the best amounts of these conditions

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.880
that I talked about.

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.280
And in fact, pushed right up to the point

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:53.960
where they were near QP of one.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.960
They just didn't quite get over one.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:59.360
So can we actually just linger on the collaboration

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.720
across different nations?

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.040
Just maybe looking at the philosophical aspect of this.

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:08.640
Even in the Cold War,

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:11.960
there's something hopeful to me besides the energy

01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:14.360
that these giant international projects

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.640
are a really powerful way to ease

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.160
some of the geopolitical tension,

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:23.040
even military conflict across nations.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:28.040
There's a war in Ukraine and Russia.

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:33.040
There's a brewing tension and conflict with China.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:38.040
Just the world is still seeking military conflict,

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.840
cold or hot.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.080
What can you say about sort of the lessons

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.960
of the 20th century in these giant projects

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.760
in their ability to ease some of this tension?

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.400
So it's a great question.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.360
So as I said, there was a reason because it was so hard.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:57.000
That was one of the reasons they declassified it.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.080
And actually they started working together

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.280
in some sense on it as well too.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.360
And I think it was really, there was

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:11.040
a heuristic or altruistic aspect to this.

01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.840
It's like, this is something that could change

01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.200
the future of humanity and its nature

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.000
and its relationship with energy.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.040
Isn't this something that we should work on together?

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.240
And that went along in those ones.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:28.600
And in particularly that any kind of place

01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.760
where you can actually have an open exchange

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.960
of people who are sort of at the intellectual frontiers

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.480
of your society, this is a good thing, right?

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:39.160
Of being able to collaborate.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.800
I've had an amazing career.

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:45.560
I've worked with people from,

01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.000
it's like hard to throw a dart at a country on the map

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.280
and not hit a country of people

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:51.520
that I've been able to work with.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.320
How amazing is that?

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.240
And even just getting small numbers of people

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.240
to bridge the cultural and societal divides

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.240
is a very important thing.

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:05.680
Even when it's a very teeny fraction

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.440
of the overall populations,

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.400
it can be held up as an example of that.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.200
But it's interesting that if you look at

01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.040
then that continued collaboration,

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.960
which continues to this day,

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.480
is that this actually played a major role in fact

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:24.720
in East-West relations or Soviet-West relations,

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:29.200
is that back in the Reagan-Gorbachev days,

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.080
which of course were interesting in themselves

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:36.080
of all kinds of changes happening on both sides, right?

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:40.320
But still like a desire to push down

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.760
the stockpile of nuclear weapons and all that,

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:47.760
within that context, there was a fairly significant

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.640
historic event that at one of the Reagan-Gorbachev summits

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:54.920
is that they didn't get there,

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.240
like they couldn't figure out how to bargain

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.400
to the point of some part of the treatic anymore,

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.160
the details of it anymore.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:06.640
But they needed some kind of a symbol almost to say,

01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:09.480
but we're still gonna keep working towards something

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.040
that's important for all of us.

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:11.880
What did they pick?

01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:12.920
A fusion project.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.920
And that was in the mid 1980s and actually then after,

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.760
so they basically signed an agreement

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.320
that they would move forward to like literally collaborate

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.520
on a project whose idea would be to show

01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.520
large net energy gain infusions commercial viability

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.080
and work together on that.

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:35.200
And very soon after that, Japan joined

01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200
as did the European Union.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:41.840
And now that project, it evolved

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.000
over a long period of time and had some interesting

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.680
political ramifications to it.

01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:49.640
But in the end, this actually also had South Korea,

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.160
India and China join as well too.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:58.160
So you're talking about a major fraction

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.840
and now Russia, of course, instead of the Soviet Union.

01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:04.000
And actually that coalition is holding together

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:07.520
despite the obvious political turmoil

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.280
that's going around on all those things.

01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:11.160
And that's a project called ITER,

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:12.840
which is under construction

01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:14.440
in the South of France right now.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.960
Can you actually, before we turn to the giant magnet

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.360
and maybe even talk about Spark and the stuff going,

01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:22.720
the all amazing stuff going on at MIT, what is ITER?

01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:26.320
What is this international nuclear fusion mega project

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.840
being built in the South of France?

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.400
So it's scientific purpose is a worthy one

01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.360
that it's essentially in any fusion device.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.560
The thing that you want to see is more and more

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.600
relative amounts of self heating.

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.240
And this is something that had not been seen,

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.640
although we had made fusion reactions

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:45.400
and we'd seen small amounts of the self heating,

01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.640
we never got to a dominant,

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:49.400
this actually goes to this QP business, okay?

01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:51.400
The goal of ITER,

01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.080
and it shifted around a little bit historically,

01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:55.040
but very, fairly quickly became,

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.720
we want to get to a large amount of self heating.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
So this is why it has a,

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:03.480
its primary feature is to get to QP of around 10.

01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.360
And through this, this is a way to study this plasma

01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:09.440
that has more higher levels

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.400
of self determination around on it.

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.240
But it also has another feature, which was,

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.760
let's produce fusion power at a relevant scale.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.720
And actually they're linked together,

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:23.200
which actually makes sense when you think about it

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.640
is that because the fusion power

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:27.480
is the heating source itself,

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:29.360
this means that they're linked together.

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:31.280
And so ITER makes,

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.200
is projected to make about 500 million Watts

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.760
of fusion power.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.480
So this is a significant amount,

01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.880
like this is what you would use for powering cities.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.000
So it's not just the research,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.480
it is the development of really trying to achieve scale here.

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:48.360
So self heating and scale.

01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:49.800
Yeah, yes.

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.840
So this meant then too,

01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.440
is the development of an industrial base

01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:57.160
that can actually produce the technologies

01:45:57.160 --> 01:45:59.120
like the electromagnets and so forth.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:00.880
And to do it with, it is a tokamak,

01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:03.000
it is one of these, yes.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:03.840
But very interesting,

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:06.920
it also revealed limitations of this as well too.

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:07.760
Like what?

01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.000
Well, it's interesting is that it is clearly a,

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:16.640
on paper and in fact, and in practice as well too,

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.920
the world, and very different political systems

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:25.160
and you consider at least geopolitical or economic rivals

01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.520
or whatever you want to use it.

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.480
Like working towards a common cause

01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:32.640
and one that we all think is worthy is very like,

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.600
okay, that's very satisfying.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.760
But it's also interesting to see the limitations of this.

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.880
It's because, well, you've got seven chefs in the kitchen.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:47.760
So what is this meant in terms of the speed of the project

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:50.160
and the ability to govern it and so forth?

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.880
It's just been a challenge, honestly, around this.

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:56.080
And this is, I mean, it's very hard technically

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:57.440
what's occurring,

01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:00.040
but when you also introduce such levels of,

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.680
I mean, this isn't just me saying it,

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.960
there's like GAO over reports from the US government

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:04.800
and so forth.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:07.760
It's hard to like steer all of this around.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.560
And what that's tended to do is make it,

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:14.760
it's not the fastest decision-making process.

01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.920
You know, my own personal view of it was,

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.480
it was interesting because you asked me,

01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:21.640
you said about the magnet and commonwealth fusion systems.

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.640
It was, I worked most of my career on ITER

01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.960
because when I came into the field in the early 1990s,

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.400
when I completed my PhD and started to work,

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:33.480
this was one of the most,

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.360
like you can't imagine being more excited about something.

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.640
Like we're going to change the world with this project.

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:39.920
We're gonna do these things.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.280
And we just like poured, like an entire generation

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.680
and afterwards as well too,

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.240
it was just poured their imagination and their creativity

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.880
about making this thing work.

01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.720
Very good.

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:51.400
But also at some point though,

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.680
when it got to being another five years of delay

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.120
or a decade of delay, you start asking yourself,

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:00.840
well, is this what I want to do?

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:02.640
Right, am I gonna wait for this?

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.640
So it was a part of me starting to ask questions

01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:07.160
with my students.

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:10.840
I was like, is there another way that we can get

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:13.040
to this extremely worthwhile goal,

01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.920
but maybe it's not that pathway.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.400
And the other part that was clearly frustrating to me

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.880
because I'm an advocate of fusion.

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.600
You asked me about, was I, you know,

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.120
I was like, well, it's laser fusion or inertial fusion

01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.280
or magnetic fusion.

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.160
I just want fusion energy, okay?

01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:33.880
Because I think it's so important to the world is that,

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:36.440
but the other thing, if that's the case,

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.600
then why do we have only one attempt at it

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.960
on the entire planet, which was Edirth?

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.920
It's like, that makes no sense to me, right?

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.240
We should have multiple attempts at this

01:48:50.240 --> 01:48:54.240
with different levels of whatever you want to think about,

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:56.680
a technical schedule, scientific risk,

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.000
which are incorporated in them.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.400
And that's gonna give us a better chance

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.280
of actually getting to the goal line.

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:03.680
With that spirit, you're leading MIT's effort

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.680
to design Spark, a compact high-field DT burning takamak.

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:10.760
How does it work?

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:11.600
What is it?

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.120
What's the motivation?

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:13.960
What's the design?

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.800
What are the ideas behind it?

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.840
At its heart, it's exactly the same concept as Eter.

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.240
So it's basically a configuration of electromagnets.

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.440
It's arranged in the shape of a donut.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.880
And within that, we would do the same thing

01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.000
that happens in all the other tokamaks,

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.960
and including in Eter and in this one,

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.720
is that, namely, you put in gas, make it into a plasma,

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:37.080
you heat it up, it gets to about 100 million degrees.

01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.040
The differentiator in Spark

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:43.080
is that we use the actual deuterium-tritium fuel,

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.080
and because of the access to very high magnetic fields,

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.080
it's in a very compact space.

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:54.000
It's very, very small.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.320
What do I mean by small?

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.320
So it's 40 times smaller in volume than Eter,

01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:02.920
but it uses exactly the same physical principles.

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:05.080
So this comes from the high magnetic field.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:07.400
So in the end, why does this matter?

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.720
What it does is it does those things,

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.120
and it should get to the point where it's producing

01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:15.920
over 100 million watts of fusion power,

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.880
but remember, it's 40 times smaller.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.920
So Eter was 500 megawatts.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.720
Technically, our design is around 150 megawatts,

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.440
so it's only about a factor of three difference,

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.440
despite being 40 times smaller.

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.800
And we see Qp large, order of 10 or something like this,

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.080
at that state is very important scientifically,

01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.200
because this is basically matches

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:42.760
what Eter is looking to do.

01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:45.560
The plasma is dominated by its own heating.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.440
That's very, very important.

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.520
And it does that for about 10 seconds.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.280
And the reason it's for 10 seconds

01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.960
is that basically allows everything to settle

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:59.240
in terms of the fusion in the plasma equilibrium.

01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.200
Everything is nice and settled.

01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:04.240
So you have seen the physical state

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.040
at which you would expect a power plant to operate

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.360
basically for magnetic fusion, like wow, right?

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.240
But it's more than that.

01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.160
And it's more than that,

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.640
it's because about who's building it and why,

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:19.240
and how it's being financed.

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:22.920
So that scientific pathway was made possible

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.520
by the fact that we had access

01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:28.560
to a next generation of magnet technology.

01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:30.680
So to explain this real quick, why do we call it,

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:33.400
you said it in the words, a superconducting magnet.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.760
What does this mean?

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.840
Superconducting magnet means that the materials

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:38.520
which are in the electromagnet

01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.440
have no electrical resistance.

01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:44.080
Therefore, when the electric current is put into it,

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.400
the current goes around unimpeded.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.680
So it could basically keep going around and around,

01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:52.080
technically for infinity or for eternity.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.800
And what that means is that when you energize

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.400
these large electromagnets,

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.480
they're using basically zero electrical power

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.560
to maintain them.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.800
Whereas if you would do this in a normal wire like copper,

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:08.200
you basically make an enormous toaster oven

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:10.280
that's consuming enormous amounts of power

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.560
and getting hot, which is the problem.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.800
That was the technical breakthrough

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:17.840
that was realized by myself.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.160
And at the time, my students and postdocs

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:24.360
and colleagues at MIT was that we saw the advent

01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:27.720
of this new superconducting material,

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:30.640
which would allow us to access much higher magnetic fields.

01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:33.480
It was basically a next generation of the technology.

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.720
And it was quite disruptive to fusion

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.240
that namely what it would allow

01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:40.080
that if we could get to this point

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.560
where we can make the round 20 Tesla,

01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.640
we knew by the rules of tokamaks

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:49.000
that this is going to allow us to vastly shrink

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.480
like the sizes of these devices.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:54.080
So it wouldn't take, although it's a worthy goal,

01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:57.720
it wouldn't take a seven nation international treaty

01:52:57.720 --> 01:52:59.160
basically to build it.

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.840
You could build it with a company and a university.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.120
So same kind of design,

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.360
but now using the superconducting magnets.

01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.200
Yeah.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:08.400
And if in fact, if you look at it's like,

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:11.280
if you just expand the size of it,

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:13.200
they look almost identical to each other

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.400
because it's based on the...

01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:16.000
And actually that comes for a reason, by the way,

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.440
is that it also looks like a bigger version

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:22.160
of the tokamak that we ran at MIT for 20 years,

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:24.840
where we established the scientific benefits

01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:27.280
in fact of these higher magnetic fields.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.000
So that's the pathway that runs.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
So we say, so what does this mean?

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:36.000
The context is different because it was made

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:37.600
because it's primarily being made

01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.640
by a private sector company spun out of MIT

01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:43.880
because the way that it raised money

01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:46.400
and the purpose of the entity which is there

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.720
is to make commercial fusion power plants,

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:51.240
not just to make a scientific experiment.

01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:55.440
This is actually why we have a partnership, right?

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:59.320
Is that our purpose at MIT is not to commercialize directly,

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.560
but boy, do we want to advance the technology

01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:03.040
and the science that comes along this.

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:05.360
And that's the reason we're sort of doing it together.

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.880
So it's MIT and Commonwealth fusion systems.

01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:10.320
So what's interesting to say about financing?

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.920
And this seems like from a scientific perspective,

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:15.280
maybe not an interesting topic,

01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.840
but it's perhaps an extremely interesting topic.

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.160
I mean, you can just look at the tension

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:22.320
between SpaceX and NASA, for example.

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.960
It's just clear that there's different financing mechanisms

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.880
that can actually significantly accelerate

01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.080
the development of science and engineering.

01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:33.440
It's great that you brought that up.

01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:36.160
We use several historic analogs

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:37.560
and one of them is around SpaceX,

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.200
which is an appropriate one because space,

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.160
putting things into orbit has a minimum size to it

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:48.040
and integrated technological complexity

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.120
and budget and things like this.

01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:54.000
So our point when we were talking about starting

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.840
a fusion commercialization company,

01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.240
people look at you like,

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:01.160
isn't this still really just a science experiment?

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.000
But one of the things that we pointed to

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.880
was SpaceX to say, well, tell me like 25 years ago,

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.240
how many people would have voted

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:11.000
that the leading entity on the planet

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.200
to put things into orbit, it's a private company.

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:15.400
People would have thought you were not so, right?

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:19.240
It's like, and what is interesting about SpaceX

01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:23.440
is that it proved it's more than actually just financing.

01:55:23.440 --> 01:55:26.600
It's really the purpose of the organization.

01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.400
So the purpose of, and I'm not against public finance

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.240
or anything like that,

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.680
but the purpose of a public entity like NASA

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:38.440
correctly speaks to the political,

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:43.640
because the cost comes from the political assembly

01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:47.360
that is there and I guess from us eventually as well too,

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:51.920
but its purpose wasn't about making a commercial product.

01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:54.560
It's about fundamental discovery and so forth,

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.360
which is all, which is all really great.

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:59.680
It's like, why did SpaceX, it's interesting

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:02.240
because why did SpaceX succeed so well

01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:03.920
is because the idea was,

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:07.680
it's like the focus that comes in the idea

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:11.320
that you're going to relentlessly like reduce cost

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:13.640
and increase efficiency is a drive

01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.200
that comes from the commercial aspect of it, right?

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.240
And this also then changes the people in the teams,

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:22.560
which are doing as well too.

01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:24.320
And in fact trickles throughout the whole thing

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.920
because the purpose isn't,

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:29.280
while you're advancing things,

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.440
like it's really good that we can put things in orbit

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.880
a lot less more cheaply,

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.000
like it advances science,

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.760
which is an interesting synergy, right?

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:37.880
It's the same thing that we think

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.040
is going to happen in fusion,

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.720
that namely this is a bootstrap effect

01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.880
that actually, that when you start to push yourself

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:47.880
to think about near term commercialization,

01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:51.640
it allows the science to get in hand faster,

01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.880
which then allows the commercialization to go faster

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.480
and up we go.

01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:57.760
By the way, we've seen this also in another,

01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.600
again, you have to watch out with analogies

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.080
because they can go so far,

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:04.640
but like biotech is another one.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:06.680
Like you look at the human genome project,

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:09.640
which was, it's sort of like,

01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:12.160
to me that's like mapping the human genome

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:15.560
is like that we can make net energy from fusion.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.040
Like it's one of those like in your drawer that you go,

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:22.040
this is a significant achievement by humanity, right?

01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:23.160
In the century.

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.840
And there's the human genome project,

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:27.800
fully government funded.

01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.960
It's gonna take 20, 25 years

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.560
because we basically know the technology.

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.200
We're just gonna be really diligent,

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.480
keep going to da, da, da.

01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:37.680
And then all of a sudden what comes along?

01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:40.400
Disruptive technology, right?

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.840
You can sequence, you know,

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:45.720
shotgun sequencing and computer recognition patterns.

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:49.400
And basically, oh, I can do this a hundred times faster.

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.800
Like, wow, right?

01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:54.400
So that's really the, you know,

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.040
to me that the story about why we started,

01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.800
why we launched common with fusion systems

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.160
was more than just about another source of funding,

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:04.600
which it is a different source of funding

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.960
because it comes, it's also a different purpose,

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.200
which is very important.

01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.040
But there's also something about a mechanism

01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.760
that creates culture.

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:16.320
So giving power to like a young student,

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:19.000
ambitious student to have a tremendous impact

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.240
on the progress of nuclear fusion

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.720
creates a culture that actually makes progress

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:24.560
more aggressively.

01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.840
Like you said, when seven nations collaborate,

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.840
it gives more incentive to the bureaucracy,

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:31.680
to slow things down, to kind of have,

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.320
let's first have a discussion

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:36.840
and certainly don't give voice to the young, ambitious minds

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.920
that are really pushing stuff forward.

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.640
And there's something about like the private sector

01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:46.640
that rewards, encourages, inspires young minds

01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:49.480
to say in the most beautiful ways,

01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:53.960
F you to the boss,

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:55.600
to sort of like, we'll make it faster,

01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:57.080
we'll make it simpler, we'll make it better,

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:57.920
we'll make it cheaper.

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.200
Yeah, and sometimes that brashness doesn't bear out.

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.800
That's an aspect that you just take

01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:04.560
a different risk profile as well too.

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:07.840
But you're right, it's this of the,

01:59:07.840 --> 01:59:09.280
I mean, it was interesting,

01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:12.400
our own trajectory at the fusion center was

01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:16.240
like we were pushed into this place by necessity as well too

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:18.080
because I told you we have,

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:19.840
and we had operated for a long time,

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:23.480
a tokamak on the MIT campus,

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:24.680
achieve these world records

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.720
like a hundred million degree plasma and stuff.

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:28.800
It's like, wow, this is fantastic.

01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:33.040
But somewhat ironically, I have to say is that it was like,

01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:36.520
oh, but we're not, this isn't the future of fusion anymore.

01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.120
Like we're not, we're just gonna stop with small projects

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.720
cause it's too small, right?

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:42.360
So we should need, we need to really move on

01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:43.880
to these much bigger projects

01:59:43.880 --> 01:59:45.880
cause that's really the future of fusion.

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:49.760
And so it was defunded and this basically put at risk

01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.680
like we were going to essentially lose MIT

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:55.120
in the ecosystem, really a fusion,

01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:56.360
both from the research,

01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:00.320
but also clearly important from the educational part of it.

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.880
So we, you know, we pushed back against this.

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.560
We got a lifeline.

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.880
We were able to go, it was in this,

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:08.600
it was in this time scale that we basically came up

02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:09.440
with this idea.

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.720
It's like, we should do this.

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:14.240
And in the end it was all of those,

02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:17.040
the people who were in the C level of the company

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:19.840
were all literally students who got caught in that.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:21.880
They were PhD students at the time.

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:24.880
So you talk about enabling another generation.

02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:27.400
It's like, yeah, there you go, right?

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:31.720
So Spark gave a lifeline, a lifeline fuel

02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:34.160
to the future center at MIT that it continues.

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.360
But it's way more than that.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.680
It was, it wasn't just about like surviving

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:38.960
for the sake of surviving.

02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:42.200
It was like, in the end for me, it became like this.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:43.280
I remember the moment,

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.160
do we talk about these moments as a scientist

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:47.960
and we were just like, we were working so hard

02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.280
about figuring out like, does this really,

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.280
will this really work?

02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:52.480
Like in this, it's complex.

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.560
Like does the magnet work?

02:00:53.560 --> 02:00:55.160
Does the interaction with the plasma work?

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:56.280
Does all these things work?

02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:59.080
And it was just a grind, push, push, push, push.

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.360
And I remember the moment,

02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:03.640
cause I was sitting in my office in Brookline

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.400
and there was just like, I read like,

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:07.760
and I was in, I don't know whatever,

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.080
the 20th or 40th slide or something into it.

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.240
And it was sort of that moment,

02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:13.760
like it just came together.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:16.440
And I like, I got, I couldn't even sit down

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:18.040
cause all it was just like, my wife was like,

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:19.960
why are you walking around the apartment like this?

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.560
Like I just couldn't, she, I said, it's going to work.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.760
Like it's going to work.

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.480
Like all the, that moment of realization

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:28.240
is like kind of amazing,

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:31.680
but it also brings the responsibility of making it work.

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.520
Yeah, how do you make it work?

02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:35.040
So you mean like that magic realization

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.080
that you can have this modern magnet technology

02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.920
and you can actually, like, why do we need to work with ITER?

02:01:41.920 --> 02:01:43.000
We can do it here.

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:43.840
Yeah, yeah.

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.800
But it's interesting that ITER is,

02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.440
that one of the reasons that like we started

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:52.440
with a group of six of us at MIT

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:56.000
once we got some funding through the establishment

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.160
of the company, it became a slightly larger.

02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.360
But in the end, we had a rather small team.

02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:04.640
Like this was like a team of order of like 20 to 25 people

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:08.800
design Spark in like about two years, right?

02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:09.880
How does that happen?

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.720
Well, we're clever, but you have to give ITER

02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:15.080
it's due here as well too, that again,

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:18.080
this is an aspect always of the bootstrap up.

02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.000
Like I go back to the human genome project.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.560
So modern day genomics would not be possible

02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:27.360
without the underlying basis that came from setting that up.

02:02:27.360 --> 02:02:28.240
It had to be there.

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.800
It had to be curiosity driven public program

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:32.040
is the same with ITER.

02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.120
But because we had the tools

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:35.600
that were there to understand ITER,

02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.720
we also had the tools to understand Spark.

02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:41.440
So we parlayed those in an extremely powerful way

02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.720
to be able to tell us about what was going to happen.

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:45.240
So these things are never simple, right?

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.440
It's like people look at this go,

02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:48.040
oh, this means we should like,

02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:50.680
should we really have a public based program about fusion

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:52.320
or should we have it all be in the private?

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.440
It's like, no, the answer is neither way

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.680
because in all these complex technologies,

02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:58.400
you have to keep pushing on all the fronts

02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:00.120
to actually get it there.

02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:01.800
So, you know, the natural question

02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:05.080
when people hear breakthrough with the inertial confinement,

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:06.960
with the magnetic confinement is,

02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.520
so when will we have commercial reactors power plants

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:13.720
that are actually producing electricity?

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.840
What's your sense looking out into the future?

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:19.960
When do you think you can envision a future

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:22.920
where we have actual electricity coming from nuclear fusion?

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.880
Partly driven by us, but in other places as well too.

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.440
So there's the advent, what's so different now

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.080
than three or four years ago,

02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.800
like we launched around four years ago.

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.040
What's so different now is the advent of a very nascent

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.040
but seemingly robust like commercial fusion endeavor.

02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:45.720
So it's not just Commonwealth Fusion Systems,

02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.040
there's something like 20 plus companies.

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.160
There's a sector now.

02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.560
There's a sector.

02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.840
They actually have something called

02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.400
the Fusion Industry Association,

02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.600
which if your viewers want to go see this,

02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:58.120
this describes the different,

02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:00.200
and they've got this plethora of approaches.

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:02.120
Like I haven't even described all the approaches,

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.000
I've basically described the mainline approaches.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.080
You know, and they're all at varying degrees

02:04:07.080 --> 02:04:09.200
of technical and scientific maturity

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:13.280
with very huge different, you know, balances between them.

02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.400
But what they share is that because they're going out

02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.080
and getting funding from the private sector

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.000
is that their stated goals are about getting fusion

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
into place so that both it meets the investor's demands,

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.840
which are interesting, right, and the time skills of that.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.520
But also it's like, well, there's gonna, and why?

02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.240
It's because it's easy.

02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.680
There's this enormous push driver

02:04:39.680 --> 02:04:43.240
about getting carbon-free energy sources out into the market.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:46.320
And whoever figures those out is going to be

02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:49.040
it's gonna be very important geopolitically,

02:04:49.040 --> 02:04:51.400
but also economically as well too.

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:55.480
So it's a different kind of bet, I guess,

02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.720
or a different kind of gamble

02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:59.920
that you're taking with fusion, but it's so disruptive

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:03.360
that it's like there's essentially a class of investors

02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:06.360
and teams that are ready to go after it as well too.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:08.280
So what do they share in this?

02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:12.480
They typically share getting after fusion on a time scale

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:16.360
so that could it have any relevance towards climate change,

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:17.960
battling climate change.

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:20.200
And I would say this is difficult,

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:22.520
but it's fairly easy because it's math.

02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:24.560
So what you do is you actually go to some target

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.920
like 2050 or 2060, something like this,

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:29.080
and say, I wanna be blank percent

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:32.120
of the world's market of electricity or something like that.

02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.280
And we know historically what it takes to evolve

02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:38.120
and distribute these kinds of technologies

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.720
because every technology takes some period of time,

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.600
so-called S curve, it's basically,

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:45.120
everything follows a logarithmic curve,

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:48.160
exponential type curve, it's a straight line of log plot.

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:51.320
And like you look at wind, solar, fission,

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:52.680
they all follow the same thing.

02:05:52.680 --> 02:05:54.800
So it's easy, you take that curve and you go,

02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:57.000
that slope and you work backwards and you go,

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.160
if you don't start in the early 2030s,

02:05:59.160 --> 02:06:04.160
like it's not gonna have a significant impact by that time.

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:07.160
So all of them share this idea.

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:09.280
And in fact, it's not just the companies now,

02:06:09.280 --> 02:06:11.960
the US federal government has a program

02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:14.200
that was started last year that said,

02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:17.000
we should be looking to try to get like the first,

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.120
and what I mean by like, what does it mean to start,

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.080
that you've got something that's putting electricity

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.160
on the grid, a pilot, what we call it.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:27.880
And if that can get started, like in the early 2030s,

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:31.640
the idea of ramping it up makes sense, it's math, right?

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:34.880
So that's the ambition, then the question is,

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:36.280
and actually this is different

02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.360
because the government program,

02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:39.840
and they vary around in this.

02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.720
So for example, the United Kingdom's government idea

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:45.520
was to get the first one on by 2040.

02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:50.520
And China has ambitions probably middle 2030s,

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.240
or maybe a little bit later.

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:56.880
And Europe, continental Europe is a little bit,

02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.120
I'm not exactly sure where it is,

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.760
but it's like later, it's like 2050 or 2060,

02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:03.760
because it's mostly linked to the Eater timeline as well too.

02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:06.800
The fusion companies, which makes sense,

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.720
it's like, of course they've got

02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.960
the most aggressive timelines.

02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.800
It's like, we're gonna map

02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.040
the human genome faster as well too, right?

02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.440
So it's interesting about where we are.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:17.960
And I think, you know, we're not all the way there,

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:20.240
but my intuition tells me we're probably gonna have

02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.920
a couple of cracks at it actually on that timeline.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:26.160
So this is where we have to be careful though,

02:07:26.160 --> 02:07:29.280
you say commercial fusion, you know, what does that mean?

02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:30.960
Commercial fusion to me means

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:35.960
that you actually have a known quantity about what it costs,

02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:38.720
what it costs to build and what it costs to operate

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:41.440
and the reliability of putting energy on the grid.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:43.280
That's commercial fusion.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.120
It's like, so it turns out that that's not necessarily

02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:48.280
exactly the first fusion devices

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:49.520
that put electricity on the grid,

02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.960
because you got it, there's a learning curve

02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:53.600
to get like better and better at it.

02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:57.600
But that's probably, I would suspect the biggest hurdle

02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:59.200
is to get to the first one.

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:01.720
The work I've done, the work I continue to do

02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.840
with autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomous vehicles,

02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.080
there's an interesting parallel there

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.200
where a bunch of companies announced a deadline

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:10.880
for themselves in 2020, 21, 22,

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:13.480
and only a small subset of those companies

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:15.920
have actually really pushed that forward.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:19.480
There's Google with Waymo, or Alphabet rather,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:25.080
and then there's Tesla with semi-autonomous driving

02:08:25.080 --> 02:08:27.440
in their autopilot full self-driving mode.

02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.760
And those are different approaches.

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:33.760
So Tesla is achieving much, much higher scale,

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:38.360
but sort of the quality of the drive is semi-autonomous.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.040
I don't know if there's a metaphor and analogy here.

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:43.160
And then there's Waymo that's focusing

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.360
on very specific cities, but achieving real full autonomy

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:50.200
with actual passengers, but the scales are much smaller.

02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:52.160
So I wonder, just like you said,

02:08:52.160 --> 02:08:53.600
there would be these kinds of similar

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.320
kind of really hard pushes.

02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.240
Absolutely.

02:08:57.240 --> 02:09:00.720
So actually this is why I'm encouraged about fusion.

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.680
So fusion's still hard, let's let everyone be clear,

02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:06.000
because of the science underneath it

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.120
of achieving the right conditions for the plasma

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:12.320
basically is a yardstick that you have to put up

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:13.640
against all of them.

02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:16.040
What's encouraging that I see in this,

02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.920
and it's actually what happens when you sort of let loose

02:09:18.920 --> 02:09:21.640
the creativity of this is,

02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:23.760
maybe I'll go back to first principles.

02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:27.120
So fusion is also a fairly strange.

02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:29.280
So if you think about building a coal plant,

02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:31.840
like burning wood and coal and gas

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.040
is actually not that much different from each other

02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:36.560
because they're kind of about the same physical conditions

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:38.840
and you get the fuel and you light it into that.

02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:40.960
Fusion is very, remember I told you

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.480
that there's this condition of the temperature,

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:44.400
which is kind of universal.

02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.040
But if you take the density of the fuel

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:49.680
between magnetic fusion and inertial fusion,

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:53.000
they're different by about a factor of 10 billion.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.640
So this and the density of fuel really matters.

02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.720
And actually so does the,

02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:58.760
this means energy confinement time is also different

02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:00.800
by a factor of 10 billion as well too,

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.400
because it's the product of those two.

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:05.000
So one's really dense and short lived,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.440
and the other one's really long lived

02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:09.600
and actually under dense as well too.

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.720
So what that means is that the way

02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:16.760
to get the underlying physical state

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:19.760
is so different among these different approaches.

02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.080
What it lends itself to is,

02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:25.480
does this mean that eventual commercial products

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.040
will actually fill different needs in the energy system?

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:31.240
So it sort of goes to your comment about,

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:34.480
I have to suspect this,

02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:36.960
because anything that is high tech

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:40.000
and is like a really important thing in our economy

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.320
tends to never find its way as one,

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.320
only one manifestation.

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:46.640
Like look at transportation as well too.

02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:49.680
We have scooters, Vespas,

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:53.720
you know, overland trucks, cars, electric cars.

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:54.560
Of course we have these

02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:56.880
because they meet different demands in it.

02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.840
So what's interesting that I find fascinating now

02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:01.200
is that we have infusion,

02:11:01.200 --> 02:11:03.000
it's going to look like that,

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.200
that probably there's the,

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:08.320
while the near term focuses on electricity production,

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.640
there might even be different kinds of markets

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.920
that actually make sense in some places,

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.000
less in others.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.640
It comes to trade-offs,

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:17.520
because we haven't really talked about the engineering yet,

02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:19.400
but the engineering really matters.

02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:22.320
To the operation of the device.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:25.000
And so it could be that,

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.800
I suspect what we'll end up with

02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:28.880
is several different configurations,

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.000
which have different features,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.440
which are trade-offs basically in the energy market.

02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:36.120
What do you see as the major engineering

02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:39.160
or general hurdles that are in the way?

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.640
Yeah.

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:45.640
So the first one is just the cost of building a single unit.

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:47.320
So fusion has,

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.120
and it's actually interesting you talked about

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:50.920
the different models that you have.

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:55.840
So fusion has one of its interesting limitations

02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:58.000
is that it's very hard,

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.800
almost at some point becomes physically impossible

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:03.400
to actually make small power units.

02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:06.640
Like a kilowatt, a thousand watts,

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.000
which is like a personal home,

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.200
like this is about a thousand watts,

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:12.160
or your personal use of energy,

02:12:12.160 --> 02:12:15.200
of electricity is about like a thousand watts.

02:12:15.200 --> 02:12:17.440
This is basically impossible

02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:19.960
for a single unit to do this.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.640
So like you're not gonna have a fusion power plant

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:24.800
like as your furnace

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:27.320
or your electric heater in your home.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:29.600
And the reason for this comes from the fact

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:32.400
that fusion relies on it being,

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.120
it's not just that it's very hot,

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:35.680
it says that the fusion power

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:37.440
is the heating source to keep it hot.

02:12:37.440 --> 02:12:40.280
So if you go too small,

02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.080
it basically just cannot keep it hot.

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:45.080
So it's interesting is that this,

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:46.320
so this is one of the hard parts.

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.760
So this means that the individual units,

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:51.440
you know, and it varies from concept to concept,

02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:54.120
but the National Academies report

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.600
that came out last year,

02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.320
sort of put the benchmark as being

02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.440
like probably the minimum size

02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:03.440
looks like around 50 million watts of electricity,

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.240
which is like enough for like a small to,

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:08.760
you know, mid-sized city actually.

02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:13.360
So that's sort of like a scale challenge.

02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:15.840
And in fact, it's one of the reasons why

02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.280
in Commonwealth and in other private sector ones,

02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.320
like they try to push this down actually

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:23.840
of trying to get to these smaller units,

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.960
just because it reduces the cost of it.

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:29.920
Then probably obviously,

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:31.520
I would say it's an obvious one,

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.520
like achieving the fusion state itself

02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:36.200
and high gain is a hard one,

02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:37.160
what we already talked about.

02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.280
What kind of hurdle, what kind of challenge is that?

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:41.520
That's achieving the right temperature density

02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.040
and energy confinement time in the fuel itself,

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:45.480
in the plasma itself.

02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:49.000
And so some of the configurations

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:53.160
which are being chosen are actually quite a ways to go

02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:54.200
in fact of seeing those.

02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.840
But what their consideration is,

02:13:56.840 --> 02:14:00.000
oh yes, but by our particular configuration,

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
the engineering simplicity confers

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.280
like an economic advantage,

02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:06.040
even if we're behind in sort of a science sense,

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:07.840
okay, which is fine.

02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:10.560
There's also what you get when you get an explosion

02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:11.720
in the private sector,

02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:13.480
you basically are distributing risks

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:14.480
in different ways, right?

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:15.320
Which makes sense.

02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:18.360
All of that good.

02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:21.280
So what I would say is that the next hurdle

02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:24.960
to really overcome is about making that electricity.

02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:28.560
So like we need to see a unit or several units,

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.640
like put using fusion in some way

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:33.600
to put a meaningful amount of energy on the grid,

02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.800
because this starts giving us real answers

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:40.560
as to like what this is going to look like.

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.640
The full end-to-end process.

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.040
The full end-to-end thing.

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:44.680
So Commonwealth's goal is that,

02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:46.760
I'll just comment to Commonwealth

02:14:46.760 --> 02:14:48.360
because I'll take some, you know,

02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:49.920
I guess some credit for this,

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.080
is that the origins of Commonwealth

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.440
were in fact in examining that.

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:58.000
Like we could see this new technology coming forward,

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.200
this new superconducting material,

02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:02.240
and the origins of our thought process

02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:04.760
were really around designing effectively

02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:06.720
the pilot plant or the commercial unit.

02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.800
It's called ARC,

02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:10.760
which is actually the step forward after Spark.

02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.760
And that was the origins of it.

02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:14.840
So all the things that were other parts of the plan,

02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.560
like Spark and the magnet,

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:20.440
were actually all informed totally by building something

02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:22.760
that's going to put net electricity on the grid.

02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:24.320
And the timing of that we still hope

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.000
is actually the early 2030s.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.280
So Spark is the design of the Takamak,

02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.320
and ARC is the actual full end-to-end thing.

02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:32.720
Is like a thing that actually puts the energy on the grid.

02:15:32.720 --> 02:15:35.120
So Spark is named, you know, intentionally,

02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:38.280
that it's like, it's on for a short period of time,

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:41.120
and it doesn't have a, it has, yeah, yeah, you know,

02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:43.760
it's the spark of the fusion revolution

02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:46.920
or something like that, I guess we could call it.

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:51.400
Yeah, so those are sort of the programmatic challenges

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:52.240
of doing that.

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:56.320
And, you know, you talked about SpaceX.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.000
So what has evolved even in the last year or so was,

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000
in fact, in March of 2022, the White House announced

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.280
that it was going to start a program

02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:08.640
that kind of looks like a SpaceX analogy,

02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:11.480
that namely, wow, we've got these things

02:16:11.480 --> 02:16:12.440
in the private sector.

02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.240
We should leverage the private sector

02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:16.480
and the advantages of what they obtain,

02:16:16.480 --> 02:16:18.920
but also with the things like this is gonna be hard

02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:22.040
and it's gonna take quite a bit of financing.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:25.120
So why don't we set up a program where we don't really get

02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:27.360
in the way of the private sector fusion companies,

02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:29.600
but we help them finance these difficult things,

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.320
which is how SpaceX basically became successful

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:34.640
through the COTS program, fantastic, right?

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:36.120
And that's evolving as well too.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.960
Like the fusion ecosystem is almost unrecognizable

02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:42.920
from where it was like five years ago around those things.

02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:47.480
How important is it for the heads of the companies

02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:50.520
that are working on nuclear fusion to have a Twitter account

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:52.880
and to be quite, you said you don't use Twitter.

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:53.720
I don't use Twitter.

02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:54.800
Very much.

02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:57.160
I mean, there is some element to,

02:16:57.160 --> 02:16:58.880
and I don't think this should be discounted,

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:02.760
whatever you think about figures like Jeff Bezos

02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:05.600
with Blue Origin or Elon Musk with SpaceX.

02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:10.840
There is a science communication, to put it in nice terms,

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:15.280
that's kind of required to really educate the public

02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:18.480
and get everybody excited and sell the sexiness of it.

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:20.480
I mean, just even the videos of SpaceX,

02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:23.000
just being able to kind of get everybody excited

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.040
about going out to space once again.

02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:26.880
I mean, there's all kinds of different ways of doing that,

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.000
but I guess what the companies do well

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.720
is to advertise themselves, to really sell themselves.

02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:33.560
It is, yeah.

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:36.760
Well, actually, I feel like one of the reasons

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:40.960
on this podcast, and so I don't have an official role

02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:43.960
in the company, and one of the reasons for this

02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:47.040
was also that it's interesting

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:49.760
because when you come from, like you're running a company,

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:52.200
it makes sense that they're promoting their own product

02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:54.960
and their own vision, which totally makes sense,

02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:58.680
but there's also a very important role for academics

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:00.920
who have knowledge about what's going on

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.520
but are sufficiently distant from it

02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.240
that they're not fully only self-motivated

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:09.160
just by their own projects or so forth.

02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:13.400
And for me, this is, I mean, we see particularly

02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:16.200
the problems of the distrust in technology,

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:21.040
and then honestly in the scientific community as well too,

02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:25.080
it will be one of the greatest tragedies, I would say,

02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:26.840
that if we go through all of this

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:29.480
and almost pull off what looks like a miracle,

02:18:29.480 --> 02:18:31.880
like technologic and scientific-wise,

02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:33.840
which is to make a fusion power plant,

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:36.320
and then nobody wants to use it

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:38.880
because they feel that they don't trust the people

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:41.480
who are doing it or the technology.

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:44.680
So we have to get so far out ahead of this.

02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.280
So I give lots of public lectures or things like this

02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:51.640
of accessing a larger range of people.

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:53.320
We're not trying to hide anything.

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.000
You can come and see, come do tours of our laboratory.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.080
In fact, I wanna set those up virtually as well too.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:01.480
You might look at our plasicized

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:02.960
and fusion-centred YouTube channel.

02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.920
So we are reaching out through those media,

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.440
and it's really important that we do those things.

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:09.720
But it's also, but also then realizing,

02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:11.640
setting up the realistic expectations

02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:12.920
of what we need to do.

02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:14.960
We're not there.

02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:17.320
We don't have commercial fusion devices yet.

02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:19.840
And you asked, what are the challenges?

02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:23.000
I'm not gonna get into any deep technical questions

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.600
about what the challenges are,

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.600
but it is the pathway not just to make fusion work

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:33.800
technically, but to make it economically competitive

02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:34.640
and viable.

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.840
So that's actually used out in the private sector

02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:38.880
is a non-trivial task.

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:41.960
And it's because of the newness of it.

02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:46.160
Like we're simultaneously trying to evolve the technology

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:49.160
and make it economically viable at the same time.

02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:52.920
Those are two difficult coupled tasks.

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:57.640
So my own research and my own drive right now

02:19:57.640 --> 02:20:00.520
is that fantastic commonwealth fusion systems is set up.

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:03.840
We have a commercialization unit of that particular kind,

02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:05.680
which is gonna drive forward a Tokamak.

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:09.640
In fact, I was just, there's discussions or there's dialogues

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.640
going on around the world with other kinds of ones

02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:15.040
like stellarators, which prefer different kinds of challenges

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:16.680
and economic advantages.

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:19.120
But what we have to, I know what we have to have.

02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:22.920
What we have to have is a new generation

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:26.160
of integrated scientists, technologists and engineers

02:20:26.160 --> 02:20:29.120
that understand like how, what needs to get done

02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:31.160
to get all the way to the goal line.

02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:32.440
Cause we don't have them now.

02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.640
So like a multidisciplinary team.

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:34.480
Yeah, exactly.

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:36.640
What's required, I mean, you've spoken about,

02:20:37.720 --> 02:20:40.040
you've said that fusion is quote,

02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:44.040
the most multidisciplinary field you can imagine.

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:45.080
Yes, yeah.

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:45.920
Why is that?

02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:46.760
What are the differences?

02:20:46.760 --> 02:20:49.880
Well, cause most of our discussion that we've had so far

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:52.160
is really like a physics discussion, really.

02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:57.160
So don't neglect physics is at the origin of this.

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.040
But already we touched on plasma physics and nuclear physics,

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:04.280
which are basically two somewhat overlap

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:06.120
but independent disciplines.

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:08.320
Then when it comes to the engineering,

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:09.440
it's almost everything.

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:10.880
So why is this?

02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:14.120
Well, let's build an electromagnet together, okay?

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:15.040
What is this gonna take?

02:21:15.040 --> 02:21:18.240
It's gonna take, it's basically electrical engineering,

02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:21.560
computer, so you understand how it goes together,

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:23.240
what happens.

02:21:23.240 --> 02:21:25.040
Computational engineering to model

02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.320
this very complex integrated thing.

02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:28.920
Materials engineering,

02:21:28.920 --> 02:21:32.200
because you're pushing materials to their limit

02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:34.120
with respect to stress and so forth.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:36.800
Takes cryogenic engineering, which is sort of a sub-discipline

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.480
but cooling things to extremely low temperatures.

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:41.200
Probably some kind of chemistry thing in there too.

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:42.480
Well, actually, yeah,

02:21:42.480 --> 02:21:44.160
which tends to show up in the materials.

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:46.320
And that's just one of the sub-components of it.

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:50.000
Like almost everything gets hit in this, right?

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.560
And you're also in a very integrated environment

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:54.880
because in the end, all of these things,

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:56.720
while you isolate them from each other

02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.600
in a physics sense, in an engineering sense,

02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.200
they all have to work like seamlessly together.

02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:05.960
So it's one of those, I mean, in my own career,

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:10.120
I've basically done atomic physics, spectroscopy,

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:13.960
plasma physics, ion etching.

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:18.120
So this includes material science,

02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:23.520
something called MHD, even magnetohydrodynamics.

02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:24.840
And now all the way through,

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:28.200
like I'm not even sure how many different careers I've had.

02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:32.120
It's also, by the way, this is also a recruiting stage

02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:34.160
for like young scientists thinking to come in.

02:22:34.160 --> 02:22:36.720
Like my comment to science is if you're bored in fusion,

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:37.800
you're not paying attention

02:22:37.800 --> 02:22:41.680
because there's always something interesting to go and do.

02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:45.520
So that's a really important part of what we're doing,

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:47.280
which isn't new in fusion, actually,

02:22:47.280 --> 02:22:50.920
and in fact is in the roots of what we've done at MIT.

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:55.200
But holy cow, like the proximity of possibility

02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.600
of commercial fusion is the new thing.

02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:59.560
You know, so my catchphrase is,

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:00.800
like you may be wondering like,

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:02.360
why weren't we doing all these things?

02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.840
Like, why weren't we pushing towards economic fusion

02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:07.880
and new materials and new methods of heat extraction

02:23:07.880 --> 02:23:08.720
and so forth,

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:11.160
because everybody knew fusion was 40 years away.

02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.520
And now it's four years away.

02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:17.360
There is a history, like you said, 40, 30, whatever,

02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:18.840
that kind of old joke.

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:23.880
There's a history of fusion projects that, you know,

02:23:23.880 --> 02:23:26.560
are characterized by cost overruns and delays.

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:28.800
How do you avoid this?

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.520
How do you minimize the chance of this?

02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:34.680
You have to build great teams is one of them.

02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:37.240
It tends to be that the smaller,

02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:39.640
there's sort of an, like I'm not an expert in this,

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:41.600
but I've seen this enough integrated-

02:23:41.600 --> 02:23:42.800
Is there an equation?

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.600
Yeah, well, there's almost,

02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:45.920
I've seen this from enough teams.

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:48.720
Like I've seen also the futility of lone geniuses

02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.480
trying to solve everything by themselves, like no.

02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:54.360
But also organizations that have 10,000 people in them

02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:57.520
is just not, doesn't lend itself at all to innovation.

02:23:57.520 --> 02:24:00.080
So like one of our original sponsors

02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:01.360
and a good friend, Vinod Khosla,

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.000
I don't know if you've ever talked to Vinod Khosla,

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:04.320
he's a venture,

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:08.160
he's got fantastic ideas about like the right sizes of teams

02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:10.360
and things that really innovate, right?

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.000
And there is an optimum place in there

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.640
is that you get enough cross-discipline and ideas,

02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:17.680
but it doesn't become so overly bureaucratic

02:24:17.680 --> 02:24:19.400
that you can't execute on it.

02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.600
So one of the ways,

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:23.400
and this was one of the challenges of fusion

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.880
is that everything was leading towards,

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:30.320
like I have to have like enormously large teams

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:33.000
just to execute because of the scale of the project.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.040
The fact that now through both technology

02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:40.120
and argue financing innovation,

02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.480
we're driving to the point where it's smaller focused teams

02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:44.440
about doing those things.

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:46.600
So that's one way to make it faster.

02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:49.720
The other way to make it faster is modularize the problem

02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:51.320
or parse the problem.

02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:54.160
So this is the other difficulty in fusion

02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:56.520
is that you tend to look at this as like,

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.000
oh, it's really just about making the plasma

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.280
into this state here that you get this energy gain.

02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:04.480
No, because in the end,

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.080
if you can parse out the different problems of making that

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:09.640
and then make it as separate as possible

02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:10.920
from extracting the energy

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:12.400
and then converting it into electricity,

02:25:12.400 --> 02:25:14.760
the more separate those are, the better they are

02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:17.920
because you get parallel paths that basically mitigate risk.

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.280
This is not new in fusion, by the way,

02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:20.960
and this is the way that we attack

02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:23.000
most complex technological,

02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.320
integrated technological challenges.

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.040
Have you by any chance seen some of the application

02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:32.200
of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning,

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:35.840
that DeepMind has a nice paper, has a nice effort

02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.040
on basically using reinforcement learning

02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:40.400
for a learned control algorithm

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:42.280
for controlling nuclear fusion?

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:44.960
Do you find those kinds of,

02:25:44.960 --> 02:25:46.440
I guess you throw them under the umbrella

02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:47.960
of computational modeling.

02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:51.160
Do you find those interesting, promising directions?

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.000
They're all interesting.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.040
So when people, I'll pull back,

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:57.360
maybe a natural question is like,

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.040
why is it different in fusion?

02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:00.560
There's a long history to fusion, right?

02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.280
It was going on for, like I told you,

02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:04.400
like stories from the late 1960s,

02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.520
like what's different now, right?

02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.040
So I think from the technology point of view,

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:11.960
there's two massive things which are different.

02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:14.120
So one of them, I'll be parochial,

02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:16.480
it's the advent of this new superconducting materials

02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:20.040
because the most mature ways that we understand

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:21.760
about how we're gonna get the fusion power plants

02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:22.600
are magnetic fusion.

02:26:22.600 --> 02:26:24.640
And by the fact that you've got access

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:28.120
to something which like changes the economic equation

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:31.600
by an over an order of magnitude is just a totally,

02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:33.200
and that wasn't that long ago,

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:34.920
it was only September of 2021

02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:36.720
that we actually demonstrated the technology.

02:26:36.720 --> 02:26:39.480
That changes the prospects there.

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:41.320
And the other one is computing

02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:43.240
and it's across the whole spectrum.

02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:46.120
It's not just in control of the fusion device.

02:26:46.120 --> 02:26:47.200
It's actually in the,

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:49.400
we actually use machine learning and things like this

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:51.120
in the design of the magnet itself.

02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:53.360
It's an incredibly complex design space.

02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.640
So you use those tools.

02:26:55.680 --> 02:26:59.120
The simulation of the plasma itself is actually,

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.080
we're at a totally different place than we were

02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:02.920
because of those things.

02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:05.280
So those are the two big drivers

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:08.400
that I see actually that make it different.

02:27:08.400 --> 02:27:09.920
And actually, and it's interesting,

02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:12.720
both those things self-enforce

02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:13.960
about what you asked about before,

02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:15.760
like how do you avoid delays and things.

02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:18.280
Well, it's by having smaller teams

02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.200
that can actually execute on those.

02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:21.600
But now you can do this

02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:26.160
because the new magnets make the devices all smaller

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.200
and the computing means your human effectiveness

02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.360
about exploring the optimization space is way better.

02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:34.240
It's like they're all interlinked to each other.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.960
Plus the modularization, like you said,

02:27:35.960 --> 02:27:37.680
and everything just kind of works together

02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:39.440
to make smaller teams more effective,

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:40.280
move faster.

02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:42.800
And it's actually, and it's through that learned experience.

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:45.800
I mean, of the things that I'm the most proud of

02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:47.480
about what came out, in fact,

02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:49.760
the origins of thinking about how we would use

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:53.240
the high temperature superconducting magnets

02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:56.640
came out of my design class at MIT.

02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:57.880
And in the design class,

02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.560
like one of the features that I kept,

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:00.400
I mean, it was interesting.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:01.320
I actually learned,

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.680
I really learned along with the students about this,

02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:05.680
but like this insistence on the features,

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:09.360
like we can't have so many coupled integrated

02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:10.960
hard technology developments.

02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.960
Like we have to separate these somehow.

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.680
So we worked and worked and worked at this.

02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:17.920
And in fact, that's what really, in my opinion,

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.040
the greatest advantage of the arc design

02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:24.480
and built into the Commonwealth Fusion System idea

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:26.320
is like to parse out the problems.

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.680
Like how can we attack these in parallel?

02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:32.080
Yeah, and so it really comes to,

02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.280
we talked about philosophy.

02:28:33.280 --> 02:28:34.880
It's like a design philosophy.

02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:37.680
Like how do you attack these kinds of problems?

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:39.600
And you do it like that.

02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:41.080
And also, like you mentioned offline,

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:42.640
that there's a power to,

02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:46.200
you know, as part of a class

02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:51.200
to design a nuclear fusion pop plan.

02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:56.320
Well, and it's hard to imagine a more powerful force

02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.000
than like 15 MIT PhD students,

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:02.000
like working together towards solving a problem.

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:03.920
And what I always, in fact,

02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.600
we recently just taught the most recent,

02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:08.760
you know, I say I teach it.

02:29:08.760 --> 02:29:10.880
I mean, I guide it actually,

02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.200
the most recent version of this,

02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:13.840
where they actually designed,

02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:15.840
based on this National Academies report,

02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:18.840
they actually designed like a pilot plant

02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:21.720
that has basis and similarities to what we had done before.

02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:24.400
But, you know, I kept wanting to like push the envelope

02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:25.240
and where they are.

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:30.080
It's like the creativity and the energy

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.640
that they bring to these things is kind of like,

02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:33.480
it keeps me going.

02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:36.000
Like I'm not gonna retire anytime soon

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:37.920
when I keep seeing that kind of dedication.

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.640
And it's wonderful around on that.

02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:45.640
It almost not to overuse or to paraphrase something, right?

02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:51.320
Which is that, you know, the famous quote by Margaret Mead,

02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:54.960
you know, never doubt that a small group of dedicated,

02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.600
you know, persons will change the world indeed.

02:29:57.600 --> 02:29:59.800
It's the only thing that ever has.

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:01.520
I mean, that's just such a powerful

02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:04.280
and inspiring thing for an individual.

02:30:04.280 --> 02:30:05.920
Find the right team, be part of that.

02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:07.960
And then you yourself, your passion,

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:09.920
your efforts could actually make a big change.

02:30:09.920 --> 02:30:11.280
Yeah, big impact.

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:16.280
I gotta ask you, so it's a whole nother

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.400
different conversation I'm sure to have,

02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:21.440
but nuclear power as it currently stands,

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:26.000
so using fission is extremely safe

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.280
despite public perception.

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:28.880
It is the safest actually.

02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:30.560
So that's a whole nother conversation,

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:35.560
but almost like a human bureaucratic physics,

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:39.320
engineering question of what lessons

02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:44.160
do you draw from the catastrophic events

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.040
where the power plants did fail?

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.320
So Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, Chernobyl.

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:50.360
What lessons do you draw?

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:52.200
Actually Three Mile Island wasn't really a disaster

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:53.440
because nothing escaped from the thing,

02:30:53.440 --> 02:30:58.440
but Chernobyl and Fukushima had obvious consequences

02:30:58.520 --> 02:31:01.200
in the populations that live nearby.

02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:03.800
What lesson do you draw from those

02:31:03.800 --> 02:31:05.880
that you can carry forward to fusion?

02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:08.400
Now I know there's, you can say that you're not gonna have

02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:10.360
the same kind of issues, but it's possible

02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:13.640
that the same folks also said they're not gonna be,

02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:15.240
have those same kind of issues.

02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:17.280
We humans, the human factor,

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:19.440
we haven't talked about that one quite as much,

02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:20.440
but it's still there.

02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.560
So to be clear, so fusion has intrinsic safety

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:27.360
with respect to it can't run away.

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:29.480
Those are physics bases.

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:32.280
Technology and engineering bases of running a complex,

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:34.720
again, anything that makes large amounts of power

02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:37.600
and heats things up has got intrinsic safety in it.

02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:40.080
And by the fact that we actually produce

02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.760
very energetic particles,

02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:44.920
this doesn't mean that there's no radiation involved in,

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:48.800
ionizing radiation to be more accurate, in fusion.

02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:51.440
It's just that it's in a very different order

02:31:51.440 --> 02:31:53.320
of magnitude basically.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:56.840
So what are the lessons in fusion?

02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:01.760
So one of them is make sure that you're looking

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:06.040
at aspects of the holistic environmental

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:09.480
and societal footprint that the technology will have.

02:32:09.480 --> 02:32:13.240
As technologists, we tend not to focus on these

02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:15.840
and particularly in early stages of development.

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:18.720
Like we just want something that works, right?

02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:21.080
But if we come with just something that works,

02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:24.480
but doesn't actually satisfy the societal demands

02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:26.920
for safety and for, I mean,

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:29.120
we will have materials that we have to dispose of

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:31.040
out of fusion, just this is,

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:33.240
but there's technological questions

02:32:33.240 --> 02:32:34.840
about what that looks like.

02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:37.920
So will this look like something that you have to put

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:40.360
in the ground for a hundred years or five years?

02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:44.120
Like, and the consequences of those are both economic

02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:47.560
and societal acceptance and so forth, but don't bury those.

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:51.120
Like bring these upfront, talk to people about them

02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:53.760
and make people realize that you're actually,

02:32:53.760 --> 02:32:55.800
the way I would look at it is that you're making fusion

02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:57.320
more economically attractive

02:32:57.320 --> 02:33:00.560
by making it more societally acceptable as well too.

02:33:01.800 --> 02:33:03.640
And then realize is that,

02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:06.920
I think there's a few interesting boundaries, basically.

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:09.200
So one of them, speaking of boundaries,

02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:11.640
that successful fusion devices,

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:15.320
I'm pretty sure will require that you don't have to

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:18.080
have an evacuation plan for anybody who lives

02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:19.160
at the site boundary.

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:24.040
So this has implications for what we build

02:33:24.040 --> 02:33:26.160
from a fusion engineering point of view,

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:29.040
but has major implications for where you can site

02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:30.920
fusion devices, right?

02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:32.960
So in many ways it becomes more like, well,

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:35.880
we have fences around industrial heat sources

02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:37.080
and things like this for a reason, right?

02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.440
For personal safety.

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:40.200
It looks more like that, right?

02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:41.440
It's not quite as simple as that,

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:43.120
but that's what it should look like.

02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:45.640
And in fact, we have research projects going on right now

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:48.680
at MIT that are like trying to push the technologies

02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:50.760
to make it more look like that.

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:52.120
I think that those are key.

02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:55.000
And then in the end, as I said,

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.160
so Chernobyl is physically impossible,

02:33:57.160 --> 02:33:59.640
actually in a fusion system.

02:33:59.640 --> 02:34:00.560
From a physics perspective.

02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:01.800
From a physics perspective,

02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:03.880
you can't run away like it did at Chernobyl,

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:05.360
which was basically human error

02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:10.120
that of letting the reactors run out of control, essentially.

02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:12.120
Human error can still happen nuclear

02:34:12.120 --> 02:34:13.680
with fusion based detectors.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.560
But in that one, if human error occurs,

02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:18.360
then it just stops and this is done.

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:19.280
And all of those things,

02:34:19.280 --> 02:34:22.120
this is the requirement of us as technologists

02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:24.880
and developers of this technology

02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.400
to not ignore that dimension in fact of the design.

02:34:28.400 --> 02:34:30.200
And that's why me personally,

02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:34.200
I'm actually pouring myself more and more into that area

02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:35.720
because this is going to be,

02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:37.760
I actually really think it is an aspect

02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.720
of the economic viability of fusion

02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:42.680
because it clearly differentiates ourselves

02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:45.440
and also sets us up to be about what we want fusion to be

02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:47.160
is that again, on paper,

02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:51.000
fusion can supply all of our energy, like all of it.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.240
So this means I want it to be

02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:55.320
like really environmentally benign,

02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.960
but this takes engineering ingenuity basically to do that.

02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:01.520
Let me ask you some wild out there questions.

02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:02.360
Sure.

02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:03.200
So first-

02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:04.640
We've been talking too much, you know.

02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:05.480
It's a-

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:06.320
Okay.

02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:11.080
Simple, practical things in everyday life.

02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:14.360
No, only revolutionizing the entire energy infrastructure

02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:15.720
of human civilization, yes.

02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:20.720
But so cold fusion, this idea, this dream,

02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:24.920
this interesting physical goals

02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:28.320
seem to be impossible, but perhaps it's possible.

02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:29.400
Do you think it is possible?

02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:31.000
Do you think down the line,

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.760
somewhere in the far distance it's possible

02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:37.960
to achieve fusion at low temperature?

02:35:39.160 --> 02:35:41.880
It's very, very, very unlikely.

02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:44.280
And this comes from,

02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:48.520
so this would require a pretty fundamental shift

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:53.160
in our understanding of physics as we know it now.

02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:54.960
And we know a heck of a lot

02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:57.400
about how nuclear reactions occur.

02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:00.360
But by the way, what's interesting is that there's,

02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.160
they actually have a different name for it.

02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:05.520
They call it leaner, like low energy nuclear reactions,

02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:07.360
but we do have low energy nuclear reactions.

02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:09.960
We know these, it's because these come from

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:12.600
particularly the weak interaction,

02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:15.320
the weak force, nuclear force.

02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:18.160
And so it's at this point,

02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:22.480
as a scientist, you always keep yourself open because,

02:36:22.480 --> 02:36:24.160
but you also demand proof, right?

02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:25.000
And that's the thing.

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:26.440
It almost requires a breakthrough

02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:28.160
on the theoretical physics side.

02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:29.880
So something, some deeper understanding

02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:31.280
about quantum mechanics,

02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:33.600
so the quantum tunneling, some weird.

02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:35.800
Yeah, and people have looked at that,

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:38.080
but even like something like quantum tunneling

02:36:38.080 --> 02:36:40.040
has a limit as to what it can actually do.

02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:42.800
So there are people who are genuine,

02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:45.240
that really want to see it make it,

02:36:45.240 --> 02:36:48.360
but it sort of goes to the extort, I mean,

02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:51.800
we know fusion happens at these high energies,

02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:54.920
like we know this extremely accurately,

02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:57.400
and I can show you a plot that shows that

02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:58.760
as you go to lower and lower energy,

02:36:58.760 --> 02:37:00.680
it basically becomes immeasurable.

02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:03.280
So if you're going down this other pathway,

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:07.040
it means there's really a very different

02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:09.520
physical mechanism involved.

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:14.520
So all I would say is that I actually poke in my head

02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:17.920
once in a while to see what's going on in that area.

02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:20.400
And as scientists, we should always try

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:21.760
to make ourselves open.

02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:25.080
But in this one, it's like,

02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:28.640
but show me something that I can measure

02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:29.760
and that it's repeatable,

02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:33.080
and then it's going to take more extraordinary effort.

02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.880
And to date, this has not met that threshold,

02:37:35.880 --> 02:37:36.720
in my opinion.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.720
So even more so than just mentioning or in that question,

02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:43.840
thinking about people that are claiming

02:37:43.840 --> 02:37:45.400
to have achieved co-fusion,

02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:48.160
I'm more thinking even about people

02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:49.840
who are studying black holes

02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:53.240
and they're basically trying to understand

02:37:53.240 --> 02:37:56.480
the function of theoretical physicists.

02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:59.240
They're doing the long haul,

02:37:59.240 --> 02:38:00.880
trying to investigate like,

02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:02.680
okay, what is happening at the cingularity?

02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:07.680
What is this kind of holographic projections on a plate,

02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:10.680
these weird fricking things that are out there

02:38:10.680 --> 02:38:13.000
in the universe, and somehow accidentally,

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.480
they start to figure out something weird.

02:38:15.480 --> 02:38:16.320
Weird, yeah.

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:17.640
And then all of a sudden-

02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:20.160
There's weirdness all over the place already, yeah.

02:38:20.160 --> 02:38:22.160
Somehow that weirdness will,

02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:24.880
I think in a timescale probably of a hundred years or so,

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:26.360
that weirdness will open.

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:31.800
It just seems like nuclear fusion and black holes

02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:33.080
and all of this are too,

02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:35.480
they're next door neighbors a little bit too much

02:38:35.480 --> 02:38:38.000
for like, you'll find something interesting.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:39.440
Well, let me tell you a story about this.

02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:40.400
Yes. Okay.

02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:41.640
It's a real story, okay.

02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.960
So there were really, really clever scientists

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:50.600
in the end of the late 1800s in the world.

02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:52.920
You talk about like James Clerk Maxwell,

02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:54.880
and you talk about Lord Kelvin,

02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:56.360
and you talk about Lorenz actually,

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:58.120
who named after these other ones,

02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:01.360
and on and on and on, and like Faraday,

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:04.160
and they discovered electromagnetism, holy cow.

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:07.120
And it's like, they figure out all these things,

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:12.120
and yet there were these weird things going on

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:14.240
that you couldn't quite figure out.

02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:17.560
And it's like, what the heck is going on with this, right?

02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.320
But we teach this all the time in physics classes, right?

02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:22.560
So what was going on?

02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:27.560
Well, there's just a few kind of things unchecked,

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:29.680
but basically we're at the end of discovery

02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:31.840
because we figured out how everything works.

02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:34.680
Because we've got basically Newtonian mechanics,

02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:36.440
and we've got Maxwell's equations,

02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:39.520
which describe basically how matter gets pushed around

02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:41.080
and how electromagnetism works.

02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:42.960
Holy cow, what a feat.

02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:45.560
But there were these few nagging things.

02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:48.720
Like for instance, there's certain kinds of rocks

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:49.640
that for some reason,

02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:52.160
like if you put a photographic plate around it,

02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:55.080
it gets burned or it gets an image on it.

02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.240
Like, well, where's the electromagnetism in that?

02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:00.800
There's no electromagnetic properties of this rock.

02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:03.040
Oh yeah, and the other thing too

02:40:03.040 --> 02:40:06.760
is that if I take this wonderful classical derivation

02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:11.420
of something that is hot about how it releases radiation,

02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:14.020
everything looks fantastic.

02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:17.980
Perfect match, oh, until I get to high frequencies

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:20.060
of the light.

02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:22.420
And then it basically just, the whole thing falls apart.

02:40:22.420 --> 02:40:24.740
In fact, it gives a physical explanation,

02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:26.460
which is total nonsense.

02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:27.740
It tells you that every object

02:40:27.740 --> 02:40:31.860
should basically be producing an infinite amount of heat.

02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:34.260
And by the way, here's the sun,

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:36.740
and we can look at the sun and we can figure out

02:40:36.740 --> 02:40:37.900
it's made out of hydrogen.

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:41.380
And Lord Kelvin actually made a very famous calculation

02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:44.420
of the sun, and he was basically one of the founders

02:40:44.420 --> 02:40:45.940
of thermodynamics.

02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:47.660
So you look at the hydrogen,

02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:49.620
hydrogen has a certain energy content

02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:52.100
that you know the latent heat basically of hydrogen.

02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:53.140
We know the mass of the sun

02:40:53.140 --> 02:40:54.620
because we knew the size of it.

02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:57.300
And he conclusively proved that basically

02:40:57.300 --> 02:41:00.460
the sun could only make net energy

02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:02.820
for about two or 3000 years.

02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.300
So therefore all this nonsense about like deep,

02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.500
because clearly the sun can only last

02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:09.100
for two or 3000 years.

02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:09.940
If you think about the,

02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:12.620
the energy content of hydrogen and what comes along.

02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:16.180
And one decade, basically one guy sitting

02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:19.020
in a postal office, you know, in Switzerland

02:41:19.020 --> 02:41:21.220
figures out that all of these, you know,

02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:23.740
Einstein of course, which was like figured out

02:41:23.740 --> 02:41:28.100
all of this, like took these seemingly unconnected things

02:41:28.100 --> 02:41:29.700
and it's like, boom, there it is.

02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:30.780
This is what, it wasn't just him,

02:41:30.780 --> 02:41:32.740
but it was like, there's quantum physics.

02:41:32.740 --> 02:41:34.980
Like this explains this other disaster.

02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:36.940
And then there's this other guy, my hero,

02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:38.900
Ernest Rutherford, experimentalist.

02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:42.060
He did the most extraordinary experiment,

02:41:42.060 --> 02:41:44.580
which is like, which was that, okay,

02:41:44.580 --> 02:41:45.740
they had these funny rocks.

02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:46.860
They emitted these particles.

02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:48.820
In fact, they called them alpha particles,

02:41:48.820 --> 02:41:50.460
alpha just A in the alphabet, right?

02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:52.860
Cause it was the first thing that they discovered.

02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:53.820
And what were they doing?

02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:56.940
So they were, they were taking these alpha particles.

02:41:56.940 --> 02:41:58.820
And I, by the way, I do this to all my students

02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:00.660
cause it's a demonstration of what you should be

02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:02.220
as a good scientist.

02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:03.540
So he took these alpha things

02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:05.660
and he was a classically trained physicist,

02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:07.780
knew everything about momentum scattering

02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:09.060
and stuff like that.

02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:11.180
And he took this and these alpha,

02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:13.300
which clearly were some kind of energy,

02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:14.860
but they couldn't quite figure out what it was.

02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:16.060
So he said, let's try to figure that,

02:42:16.060 --> 02:42:17.580
we'll actually use this to try to probe

02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:18.740
the nature of matter.

02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:22.060
So he took this, took these alpha particles

02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:24.460
and a very, very thin gold foil.

02:42:24.460 --> 02:42:25.900
And so what you wanted to see was that

02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:28.740
as they were going through the way that they would scatter

02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:31.300
based on classical, in fact, the Coulomb collision,

02:42:31.300 --> 02:42:32.940
based on classical mechanics,

02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:35.740
this will tell me, reveal something

02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:38.140
about what the nature of the charge distribution

02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:40.140
is in matter because they didn't know,

02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:42.020
like where the hell is this stuff coming from?

02:42:42.020 --> 02:42:44.020
Even though they'd solved that electromagnetism,

02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.780
they didn't know like what made up charges.

02:42:46.780 --> 02:42:48.500
Okay, very interesting.

02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:51.780
Through it goes, and so what did you set up?

02:42:51.780 --> 02:42:53.700
So it turns out in these experiments,

02:42:53.700 --> 02:42:57.940
what you did was because if these so-called alphas,

02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:00.700
which actually now we know something else,

02:43:00.700 --> 02:43:02.660
as they go through, they would deflect.

02:43:02.660 --> 02:43:03.980
How much they deflect tells you

02:43:03.980 --> 02:43:06.140
how strong an electric field they saw.

02:43:06.140 --> 02:43:07.220
So you put detectors,

02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:10.500
because if you put like a piece of glass in front of this,

02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:12.420
what will happen is that when the alpha particle hits,

02:43:12.420 --> 02:43:14.060
it literally gives a little boop,

02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:15.660
a little boop of light like this.

02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:18.180
It scintillates, a little blue flash.

02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:20.220
So he would train his students or postdocs

02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:21.780
or whatever the heck they were at the time.

02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:22.820
You have to train yourself

02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:24.340
because you have to put yourself in the dark

02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:27.060
for like hours to get your eyes adjusted.

02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:28.460
And then they would start the experiment

02:43:28.460 --> 02:43:30.900
and they would sit there and literally count the things.

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:32.620
And they could see this pattern developing,

02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:35.500
which was revealing about what was going on.

02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.340
But there was also another part to the experiment,

02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:41.220
which was that, it's like, here's the alphas,

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:43.300
here's the source, they're going this way.

02:43:43.300 --> 02:43:45.020
They could tell they were going in one direction only,

02:43:45.020 --> 02:43:47.380
basically, they're going in this direction.

02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:48.540
And you put all these over here

02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:50.780
because you wanna see how they deflect and bend through it.

02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:53.100
But you put a control in the experiment,

02:43:53.100 --> 02:43:58.100
but you basically put glass plates back here,

02:43:58.220 --> 02:44:01.020
because obviously everything should just deflect,

02:44:01.020 --> 02:44:02.620
but nothing should bounce back.

02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:05.380
So it's the control of the experiment.

02:44:05.380 --> 02:44:06.820
But what did they see?

02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:12.820
They saw things bouncing back, like what the hell?

02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:16.860
Like that fit no model of any idea, right?

02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:21.580
But Rutherford refused to ignore what was a clear,

02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.180
like they validated it and he sat down

02:44:24.180 --> 02:44:25.780
and based on classical physics,

02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:28.620
he made the most extraordinary discovery,

02:44:28.620 --> 02:44:30.540
which was the nucleus,

02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:33.460
which is a very, very strange discovery.

02:44:33.460 --> 02:44:34.580
What I mean by that,

02:44:34.580 --> 02:44:35.940
because what he could figure out from this

02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:38.380
is that in order for these particles

02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:40.820
to bounce back and hit this plate,

02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:45.180
they were hitting something that must be heavier than them.

02:44:45.180 --> 02:44:50.180
And that basically something like 99.999% of the mass

02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:52.740
of the matter that was in this gold foil

02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:54.580
was in something that contained

02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:57.460
about one trillionth of the volume of it.

02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:00.780
And that's called the nucleus.

02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:03.900
And until, and you talk about, so how revealing is this?

02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:07.700
This totally changes your idea of the universe

02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:11.780
because a nucleus is a very unintuitive, non-intuitive thing.

02:45:11.780 --> 02:45:13.860
It's like, why is all the mass

02:45:13.860 --> 02:45:15.860
in something that is like zero,

02:45:15.860 --> 02:45:19.340
like basically it was the realization that matter is empty.

02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:21.100
It's all empty space.

02:45:21.100 --> 02:45:22.180
And that changes everything.

02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:24.100
And it changes everything.

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.300
Until you had that, like you had steam engines,

02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:27.740
by the way, you had telegraph wires,

02:45:27.740 --> 02:45:28.980
you had all those things.

02:45:28.980 --> 02:45:31.620
But that realization like opened up,

02:45:31.620 --> 02:45:34.260
those two realization opened up everything,

02:45:34.260 --> 02:45:37.220
like lasers, you think about the modern world

02:45:37.220 --> 02:45:38.060
of what we use.

02:45:39.020 --> 02:45:40.140
And that set it up.

02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:42.700
So all I would point out is that there's a story already

02:45:42.700 --> 02:45:45.220
that sometimes there's these nagging things

02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.180
at the edge of science that, you know,

02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:49.460
we seem, we pat ourselves on the back

02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:51.420
and we think we got everything under control.

02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:54.940
Of course, by the way, that was the origin of also,

02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:57.300
that it, think about this, that was 1908.

02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:00.860
It took like another 20 some years

02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:02.900
before people put that together with,

02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:05.500
that's the process that's powering stars,

02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:09.180
is the rearrangement of those nuclei, not atoms.

02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:11.700
That's why Kelvin wasn't wrong.

02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:14.340
He just, he was working with the wrong assumptions, right?

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.540
So fast forward to today, like what would this mean, right?

02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:19.060
Well, there's a couple of things like this

02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:20.580
that sit out there in physics.

02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:22.980
And I'll point out one of them, which is very interesting.

02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:25.180
We don't know what the hell makes up 90%

02:46:25.180 --> 02:46:27.220
of the mass in the universe.

02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:29.580
So, you know, the search for dark matter, right?

02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:30.420
What is it?

02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:32.060
We still haven't discovered it.

02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:36.300
90% of the mass of the universe is undetectable.

02:46:37.140 --> 02:46:38.300
Like what?

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:40.300
And then, you know, and dark energy and again,

02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:42.740
black holes are the window into this.

02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:45.340
Well, then black hole, I mean, sometimes black holes

02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:49.140
are way better understood than those things as well too.

02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:51.540
So all it tells us is that we shouldn't have hubris

02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:54.420
about the ideas that we understand everything.

02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:57.940
And when we, you know, who knows what the next major

02:46:57.940 --> 02:47:00.100
intellectual insight will be

02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:02.300
about how the universe, you know, functions.

02:47:02.300 --> 02:47:06.620
And actually I think Rutherford is the one who's attributed

02:47:06.620 --> 02:47:10.420
at least that quote that physics is the only real science,

02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:12.500
everything else is stamp collecting, right?

02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:13.820
So there's-

02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:14.660
I'm sorry, he's my hero,

02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:18.220
but I'll slightly disagree with that, yes.

02:47:18.220 --> 02:47:19.940
Well, no offense to stamp collecting,

02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:21.100
it's very important too.

02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:23.860
But, you know, you have to have humility

02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:26.340
about the kind of disciplines that make progress

02:47:26.340 --> 02:47:29.140
at every stage in science.

02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:29.980
Yeah, exactly.

02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:32.180
Physics did make a huge amount of progress

02:47:32.180 --> 02:47:33.380
in the 20th century,

02:47:33.380 --> 02:47:35.820
but it's possible that other disciplines start to step in.

02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.460
Yeah, but Rutherford couldn't imagine

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:39.060
like mapping the human genome

02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:40.860
because he didn't even know about DNA.

02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:42.340
Yeah, or computers really.

02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:43.180
Or computers.

02:47:43.180 --> 02:47:45.140
He really probably didn't think deeply about computation.

02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:47.540
Who knows, it's like, here's a wild one,

02:47:47.540 --> 02:47:52.020
what if like the next great revelation to humanity

02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:54.620
about the universe is not done by the human mind?

02:47:54.620 --> 02:47:56.820
That seems increasingly-

02:47:56.820 --> 02:47:58.420
Likely. More likely.

02:47:58.420 --> 02:47:59.980
And then you start to ask deep questions

02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:02.020
about what is the purpose of science?

02:48:02.020 --> 02:48:07.020
For example, if AI system will design

02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:10.780
a nuclear fusion reactor better than humans do,

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:12.780
but we don't quite understand how it works,

02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.740
and the AI can't, we know that it works,

02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:17.420
we can test it very thoroughly,

02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:21.100
but we don't know exactly what the control mechanism is,

02:48:21.100 --> 02:48:23.660
maybe what the chemistry of the physics is.

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.100
AI can't quite explain it.

02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:26.100
They just can't, it's-

02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:28.900
It's impenetrable to our consciousness, basically,

02:48:28.900 --> 02:48:30.180
trying to hold it all together.

02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:32.660
And then, okay, so now we're living in that world

02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:34.820
where many of the biggest discoveries

02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:36.220
are made by AI systems.

02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:37.060
Yeah.

02:48:39.100 --> 02:48:40.340
As if we weren't growing bigger.

02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.260
Yeah, I say, again, I'll point out,

02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:46.220
like when my godmother was born,

02:48:46.220 --> 02:48:47.940
none of this was in front of us, right?

02:48:47.940 --> 02:48:49.900
It's like, we live in an amazing time.

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:54.900
It's like my grandfather plowed fields with a horse.

02:48:56.100 --> 02:48:58.300
I get to work on designing fusion reactors.

02:48:58.300 --> 02:48:59.700
Yeah. Yeah.

02:48:59.700 --> 02:49:00.940
Pretty amazing time.

02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:03.140
But still, there's humans, so we'll see.

02:49:03.140 --> 02:49:05.180
We'll see if that's around 100 years.

02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.260
Maybe it'll be cyborgs and robbers.

02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:09.260
I think we're pretty resilient, actually.

02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:10.100
Yeah, I know.

02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:14.540
One lesson from life is it finds a way.

02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:16.580
Let me ask even a bigger question,

02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:18.420
as if those weren't big enough.

02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:21.860
Let's look out maybe a few hundred years,

02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:24.060
maybe a few thousand years out.

02:49:24.060 --> 02:49:26.180
There's something called the Kardashev Scale.

02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:28.180
It's a method of measuring civilization's level

02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:29.700
of technological advancement

02:49:29.700 --> 02:49:32.540
based on the amount of energy it's able to use.

02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:34.580
So type one civilization,

02:49:34.580 --> 02:49:36.740
and this might be, given all your work,

02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:40.740
is no longer a scale that quite makes sense,

02:49:40.740 --> 02:49:45.740
but it very much focuses on the natural source of fusion,

02:49:46.140 --> 02:49:48.140
which is, for us, the sun.

02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:51.740
Type one civilizations are able to leverage,

02:49:51.740 --> 02:49:55.220
sort of collect all the energy that hits Earth.

02:49:55.220 --> 02:49:57.660
And then type two civilizations

02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:00.140
are the ones that are able to leverage

02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:03.100
the entirety of the energy that comes from the sun

02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:05.020
by maybe building something.

02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.820
Like a Dyson Sphere.

02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:09.620
So when will we reach type one status?

02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:12.500
Is get to the level which we're, I think,

02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:15.700
maybe a few orders of magnitude away from currently.

02:50:15.700 --> 02:50:17.780
And in general, do you think about this kind of stuff?

02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:22.980
Where energy is so fundamental to the life on Earth,

02:50:23.060 --> 02:50:25.980
but also the expansion of life into the universe.

02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:26.820
Oh, yeah.

02:50:26.820 --> 02:50:30.340
So one of the fun, on a weekend,

02:50:30.340 --> 02:50:32.460
when I sat down and figured out

02:50:32.460 --> 02:50:34.540
what would it mean for interstellar travel,

02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:36.980
like to have a DT fusion.

02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:39.900
In fact, I talked about my design class.

02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:42.540
One of my design classes was how you use,

02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:47.180
essentially, a special configuration of a fusion device

02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:50.620
for not only traveling to, but colonizing Mars.

02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:53.980
So, if you talk about energy use

02:50:53.980 --> 02:50:56.660
being at the heart of civilizations,

02:50:56.660 --> 02:50:58.780
so what if you want to go to Mars not to just visit it,

02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:02.540
but actually leave people there and make something happen?

02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:04.580
Needs massive amounts of energy.

02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.700
So what would that look like?

02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:08.340
And it actually transforms how you're thinking

02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:09.900
about doing that as well, too.

02:51:09.900 --> 02:51:11.900
Oh yeah, so we do those kinds of fun.

02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:15.180
And actually, it was a fairly quasi-realistic scenario.

02:51:15.180 --> 02:51:17.780
Do you think it'll be nuclear fusion

02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:20.420
that powers the civilization on Mars?

02:51:20.420 --> 02:51:22.260
Well, what we considered was something,

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:25.100
so it turns out that there's thorium,

02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:26.820
which is a heavy element,

02:51:26.820 --> 02:51:29.060
so it's a so-called fertile element,

02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:32.180
that we know, we still know fairly little

02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:36.460
about the geology of Mars in a deep sense.

02:51:36.460 --> 02:51:38.060
And we know that there's a lot of this

02:51:38.060 --> 02:51:39.180
on the surface of Mars.

02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:41.740
So one of the things we considered was what would happen,

02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:45.060
that it's basically a combination of a fusion device

02:51:45.060 --> 02:51:48.900
that actually makes fuel from the thorium.

02:51:48.900 --> 02:51:49.740
Oh.

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:51.580
But the underlying energy one

02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:53.860
was fission itself as well, too.

02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:55.940
So this is one of the examples of being,

02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:58.020
trying to be clever, right around those things.

02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:59.380
Or what is it, you know,

02:51:59.380 --> 02:52:01.540
this also means it's like interstellar travel.

02:52:01.540 --> 02:52:03.820
It's like, oh yeah, that looks almost like impossible,

02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:06.100
basically, from an energy balance point of view.

02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.700
It's just like the energy required

02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.660
that you have to transport to get there.

02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:13.700
Almost the only things that would work are DT fusion

02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:16.860
and basically annihilation.

02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:18.460
It's like Star Trek, right?

02:52:18.460 --> 02:52:22.380
So your sense is that interstellar travel

02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.580
will require fusion power.

02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:27.860
Oh, it's almost even impossible with fusion power, actually.

02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:29.420
It's so hard.

02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:33.500
It's so hard because you have to carry the fuel with you

02:52:33.500 --> 02:52:35.060
and the rocket equation tells you

02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:37.660
about how much fuel you'll use to take.

02:52:37.660 --> 02:52:39.460
So what you end up with is like,

02:52:39.460 --> 02:52:41.460
how long does it take to go to these places?

02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:44.900
And it's like staggering, you know, periods of time.

02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:48.140
So I tend to believe that there's alien civilizations

02:52:48.140 --> 02:52:50.100
dispersed all throughout the universe.

02:52:50.100 --> 02:52:52.860
Yeah, but we might be totally isolated from them.

02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:56.100
So you think we're not, there's none in this galaxy.

02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:58.860
So like, I guess, and the question I also have

02:52:58.860 --> 02:53:01.980
is what kind of, do you think they have nuclear fusion?

02:53:01.980 --> 02:53:04.060
It's like, is it all, is the physics all the same?

02:53:04.060 --> 02:53:06.100
Yeah, all the physics is all the same, yeah, right.

02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:08.300
So this is the, and this is the Fermi paradox.

02:53:08.300 --> 02:53:11.140
Like where the hell is everybody in the universe, right?

02:53:12.500 --> 02:53:15.180
Well, there's some, you know, the scariest one of those

02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:18.380
is that I would point out that there's been, you know,

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:21.540
there's, you know, order of many tens of millions

02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:23.780
of species on the planet earth.

02:53:23.780 --> 02:53:28.060
And only one ever got to the point of sophisticated tool use

02:53:28.060 --> 02:53:31.100
that we could actually start essentially leveraging

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:35.460
the power of what's in nature to our own will.

02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:37.500
Does this mean that basically this means,

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:40.180
so almost, look, there is almost certainly life

02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:43.180
or DNA equivalents or whatever would be somewhere.

02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:44.980
I mean, just cause you just need a soup

02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:47.860
and you need energy and you get organics

02:53:47.860 --> 02:53:50.900
and whatever the equivalent of amino acids are.

02:53:50.900 --> 02:53:53.100
But, you know, most of the life on earth has been that,

02:53:53.100 --> 02:53:55.540
those are still amazing, but it's still like,

02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:57.300
it's not very interesting.

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.700
Are we actually the accident of history?

02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:00.940
This is a very interesting one.

02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:03.060
A super, super rare accident.

02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:05.860
Super rare, and then of course the other part is that

02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:08.940
also just the other scary part of it,

02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:11.460
which is if you look at the fairy paradoxes,

02:54:11.460 --> 02:54:13.220
good, good, we got to this point.

02:54:13.220 --> 02:54:16.140
How long has it been in humans?

02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:18.740
So humans, Homo sapien has been around for whatever,

02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:21.740
100,000 years, 200,000 years, something like that.

02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:25.780
Our ability in that timeline to actually make an imprint

02:54:25.780 --> 02:54:28.620
on the universe by emitting radio waves

02:54:28.620 --> 02:54:32.260
or by modifying, you know, nature in a significant way

02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:35.820
has only been for about 100 of those 100,000 years.

02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:38.220
And, you know, are we, it's a good question.

02:54:38.220 --> 02:54:41.340
So is it by definition that by the fact

02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:43.860
that when you are able to reach that level

02:54:43.860 --> 02:54:46.980
of being able to manipulate nature and for example,

02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:51.100
discover, you know, discover like fission

02:54:51.100 --> 02:54:55.780
or burning fossil fuels and all this,

02:54:55.780 --> 02:54:57.780
is that what it says, oh, you're doomed.

02:54:57.780 --> 02:55:01.380
Because by definition, any species that gets to that point

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:03.740
that can modify their environment like that,

02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:06.860
they'll actually push themselves, you know, past.

02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:08.540
That's one of the most depressing scenarios

02:55:08.540 --> 02:55:09.380
that I can imagine.

02:55:09.380 --> 02:55:10.220
Yeah, so the-

02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:13.620
So basically we will never line up in time

02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:15.740
because you get this little teeny window in time

02:55:15.740 --> 02:55:17.660
of where civilization might occur

02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:20.420
and you can never see it because you never,

02:55:20.420 --> 02:55:23.820
these sort of like scatter like fireflies

02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:25.820
around the galaxy and you never, yeah, yeah.

02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:27.860
It goes up and then explodes,

02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:30.340
destroys itself because of the exponential.

02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:31.660
And when we say destroy ourselves,

02:55:31.660 --> 02:55:33.700
all we'd have to do is that we basically

02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:36.100
if humans are all left

02:55:36.100 --> 02:55:38.140
and we're still living on the planet

02:55:38.140 --> 02:55:40.980
but all we have to do is go to the technology

02:55:40.980 --> 02:55:44.180
of like, you know, 1800 and we're invisible

02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:45.540
in the universe again.

02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:47.180
Yeah.

02:55:47.180 --> 02:55:49.180
So it was, when I listened to the,

02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:50.980
I thought I wanted to talk about this as well too

02:55:50.980 --> 02:55:53.300
because it comes from, well, it comes from a science point

02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:55.100
actually of what it means.

02:55:55.100 --> 02:55:57.700
But also to me, it's like another compelling driver

02:55:57.700 --> 02:56:00.740
of telling us it's like why we should try really hard

02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:02.500
not to screw this up.

02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:04.220
Like we're in this unique place

02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:06.820
of our ability to discover and to make it.

02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:09.220
And I just don't want to give up

02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:11.100
about thinking that we can get through.

02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:13.260
Yeah, I tend to see that there's some kind

02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:14.580
of game theoretic force,

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:16.620
like with mutual assured destruction

02:56:16.620 --> 02:56:19.380
that ultimately in each human being,

02:56:19.380 --> 02:56:24.380
there's a desire to survive and a willingness to cooperate,

02:56:25.140 --> 02:56:27.820
to have compassion for each other in order to survive.

02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:32.020
And I think that, I mean, maybe not in humans

02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:35.020
but I can imagine a nearly infinite number of species

02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:40.020
in which that overpowers any technological advancement

02:56:41.260 --> 02:56:43.780
that can destroy or rewind the species.

02:56:43.780 --> 02:56:48.300
So I think if humans fail, I hope they don't.

02:56:48.300 --> 02:56:50.060
I see a lot of evidence for them not,

02:56:50.060 --> 02:56:52.300
but it seems like somebody will survive.

02:56:52.300 --> 02:56:53.940
And there you start to ask questions

02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:56.340
about why we haven't met yet.

02:56:56.340 --> 02:56:58.180
Maybe it's just space is large.

02:56:58.180 --> 02:57:00.700
Oh, space is, it's,

02:57:00.700 --> 02:57:05.220
I think in logarithms and I can't even fathom space.

02:57:05.220 --> 02:57:07.540
This is extraordinary, right?

02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:09.980
Yeah. It's extraordinarily large.

02:57:09.980 --> 02:57:11.420
I mean, there's so many places on earth.

02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:13.980
I just recently visited Paris for the first time

02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:15.580
and there's so many other places I haven't visited yet.

02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:16.660
There's so many other places.

02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:19.140
Well, I like to, it's interesting

02:57:19.140 --> 02:57:22.140
that we have this fascination with alien life.

02:57:22.140 --> 02:57:25.980
We have what is essentially alien life on earth already.

02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:27.660
Like you think about the organisms

02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:31.060
that develop around deep sea, like thermal vents.

02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:34.660
One of my favorite books of all time from Stephen J. Gould.

02:57:34.660 --> 02:57:37.780
If you've never read that book, it kind of blows your mind.

02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:40.340
It's about the Cambrian explosion of life.

02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:42.500
And it's like, oh, you look at these things

02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:46.300
and it's like, the chance of us existing as a species,

02:57:46.300 --> 02:57:50.260
like the genetic diversity was larger back then.

02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:52.540
You know, this was about 500 million years ago

02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:53.620
or something like that.

02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:56.460
It is a mind-altering trip

02:57:56.500 --> 02:57:58.180
of thinking about our place in the universe,

02:57:58.180 --> 02:57:59.020
I have to say.

02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:03.340
Plus the mind itself is a kind of alien with almost,

02:58:04.780 --> 02:58:06.300
almost a mystery to ourselves.

02:58:06.300 --> 02:58:07.420
We still don't understand it.

02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:10.620
The very mechanism that helps us explore the world

02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:12.260
is still a mystery.

02:58:12.260 --> 02:58:16.300
So that, like understanding that will also unlock,

02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:21.300
quite possibly unlock our ability to understand the world

02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:23.460
and maybe build machines that help us understand the world,

02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:24.500
build tools that...

02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:25.820
Yeah, I mean, it already has.

02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:27.860
I mean, our ability to understand the world

02:58:27.860 --> 02:58:31.460
is ridiculous almost, actually.

02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:34.460
And post the bot on TikTok.

02:58:34.460 --> 02:58:38.140
It's almost unbelievable where we've gotten all this to.

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:42.580
So what advice would you give to young folks

02:58:42.580 --> 02:58:44.980
or folks of all ages who are lost in this world,

02:58:44.980 --> 02:58:47.020
looking for a way, looking for a career

02:58:47.020 --> 02:58:49.700
they can be proud of or looking to have a life

02:58:49.700 --> 02:58:50.540
they can be proud of?

02:58:50.540 --> 02:58:53.460
Yeah, oh, the first thing I would say is don't give up.

02:58:53.460 --> 02:58:55.980
I get to see multiple sides of this.

02:58:55.980 --> 02:59:00.980
And there seems to be a level of despair

02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:03.180
in a young generation.

02:59:03.180 --> 02:59:07.260
It's like, no, it's almost like the Monty Python skit,

02:59:07.260 --> 02:59:08.820
like I'm not dead yet, right?

02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:11.860
I mean, we're not there.

02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:16.860
We're in a place that, don't say the world's gonna end

02:59:17.340 --> 02:59:18.740
in 300 days or something.

02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:20.380
It's not, okay.

02:59:20.420 --> 02:59:24.100
And what we mean by this is that we have a robust society

02:59:24.100 --> 02:59:26.420
that's figured out how to do like amazing things

02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:28.740
and we're gonna keep doing amazing things.

02:59:28.740 --> 02:59:32.780
But that shouldn't be complacency about what our future is

02:59:32.780 --> 02:59:35.740
and the future for their children as well too.

02:59:35.740 --> 02:59:37.980
And in the end, I mean, it's a very,

02:59:37.980 --> 02:59:41.500
it's a staggering legacy to think of what we've built up

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:43.700
primarily by basically using carbon fuels.

02:59:43.700 --> 02:59:45.380
Like people almost tend to think of this

02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:47.180
as an evil thing that we've done.

02:59:47.180 --> 02:59:49.660
I think it's an amazing thing that we've done,

02:59:49.660 --> 02:59:51.740
but we owe it to ourselves

02:59:51.740 --> 02:59:54.580
and to this thing that we've built.

02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:56.860
I mean, talking about the end of the world is just nonsense.

02:59:56.860 --> 03:00:00.380
What it is is it's the end of this kind of lifestyle

03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:02.980
and civilization at this scale

03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:05.260
and the ability to execute on these kinds of things

03:00:05.260 --> 03:00:06.980
that we are talking about today.

03:00:06.980 --> 03:00:09.580
Like we are extraordinarily privileged.

03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:13.500
We are in a place where it's almost unfathomable

03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:16.460
compared to most of the misery that humans have lived in

03:00:16.460 --> 03:00:17.380
for our history.

03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:19.780
So don't give up about this, okay?

03:00:19.780 --> 03:00:23.060
But also roll up your sleeves and let's get going

03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:25.180
at solving and getting real solutions

03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:26.940
to the problems that are in front of us,

03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:28.300
which are significant.

03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:33.420
Most of them are linked to what we use in energy,

03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:34.540
but it's not just that.

03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:36.620
It's around all the aspects of like,

03:00:36.620 --> 03:00:41.100
what does it mean to have a distributed energy source

03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:43.780
that lifts billions of people out of poverty,

03:00:43.780 --> 03:00:46.980
particularly outside of like the Western nations, right?

03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:50.140
That seems to me a pretty compelling,

03:00:50.140 --> 03:00:53.820
moral goal for all of us,

03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:57.500
but particularly for this upcoming generation.

03:00:57.500 --> 03:00:59.300
And then the other part is that

03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:02.340
we've got possible solutions in front of us.

03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:07.340
Apply your talents in a way that you're passionate about

03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:09.780
and is gonna make a difference.

03:01:10.780 --> 03:01:14.860
And that's only possible with optimism, hope and hard work.

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:15.820
Yeah.

03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:17.900
What, easy question.

03:01:19.340 --> 03:01:21.380
Certainly easier than nuclear fusion.

03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:22.540
What's the meaning of life?

03:01:22.540 --> 03:01:23.780
Why are we here?

03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:24.980
42.

03:01:24.980 --> 03:01:25.820
Is it 42?

03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:26.660
No, no.

03:01:28.180 --> 03:01:30.260
We already discussed about the beauty of physics,

03:01:30.260 --> 03:01:32.260
that there's almost a desire to ask a why question

03:01:32.260 --> 03:01:34.300
about why the parameters have these values.

03:01:34.300 --> 03:01:37.020
Yeah, it's very tempting, yeah.

03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:41.540
It's an interesting hole to go down as a scientist

03:01:41.540 --> 03:01:45.660
because we're a part of what people have a hard time,

03:01:45.660 --> 03:01:47.540
people who aren't scientists have a hard time

03:01:47.540 --> 03:01:49.940
understanding what scientists do to themselves.

03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:53.540
And a great scientist does a very non-intuitive

03:01:53.540 --> 03:01:54.980
or non-human thing.

03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:57.580
What we do is we train ourselves to doubt ourselves,

03:01:57.580 --> 03:01:59.860
like how, like that's a great scientist.

03:01:59.860 --> 03:02:01.660
We doubt everything we see,

03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:03.380
we doubt everything that we think,

03:02:03.380 --> 03:02:08.380
because we basically try to turn off the belief valve,

03:02:09.620 --> 03:02:12.100
right, that humans just naturally have.

03:02:13.540 --> 03:02:14.980
So when it comes to these things,

03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:17.260
like I can make my own comments to this,

03:02:17.260 --> 03:02:19.780
it's like, personally, you see these things

03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:20.820
about the ratios of life.

03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:22.660
And I made a comment where I said, well, you know,

03:02:22.660 --> 03:02:26.020
a wrap my, some part of my brain that just goes,

03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:28.380
yeah, well, yeah, because we're the only interesting,

03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:30.660
you know, multiverse, because by definition,

03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:33.380
it has to look like this, you know.

03:02:33.380 --> 03:02:35.420
But there's, I have to say, there's other times,

03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:37.820
I can say in the history of the whole

03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:40.020
of what has happened over the last 10 years,

03:02:40.020 --> 03:02:42.300
there have been some pretty weird coincidences,

03:02:42.300 --> 03:02:45.780
like coincidences that like you look at it and just go,

03:02:45.780 --> 03:02:48.780
is that really, was that really a coincidence?

03:02:48.780 --> 03:02:53.780
Is something like pushing us towards these things?

03:02:54.260 --> 03:02:56.580
And it's a natural, it's a human instinct because,

03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:58.660
you know, since the beginnings of humanity,

03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:01.820
we've always assigned, you know,

03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:06.820
human motivation and needs to these somewhat,

03:03:06.820 --> 03:03:08.740
you know, empirical observations.

03:03:08.780 --> 03:03:10.580
And in some sense, the stories,

03:03:11.500 --> 03:03:14.740
before we understand the real explanations,

03:03:14.740 --> 03:03:19.740
the stories, the myths serve as a good approximation

03:03:20.060 --> 03:03:22.140
for the thing that we're yet to understand.

03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:24.740
And in that sense, you said the antithesis

03:03:24.740 --> 03:03:28.060
to sort of scientific doubt is having a faith

03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:31.900
in these stories that are almost silly

03:03:31.900 --> 03:03:34.820
when looked at from a scientific perspective,

03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:36.420
but just even the feelings of,

03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:39.020
it seems that love is a fundamental fabric

03:03:39.020 --> 03:03:41.060
of human condition.

03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:42.380
And what the hell is that?

03:03:43.700 --> 03:03:45.980
Why are we so connected to each other?

03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:48.820
As a physicist, I go, it's, you know,

03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:52.500
this is a repeatable thing that's due to a set of synapses

03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:54.820
that fire in a particular pattern and all this.

03:03:54.820 --> 03:03:56.460
You know, that's kind of like, okay, man,

03:03:56.460 --> 03:03:57.980
what a, you know, what a drag that is,

03:03:57.980 --> 03:03:59.060
right, to think of it this way.

03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:01.660
And you can have an evolutionary biology explanation,

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:02.900
but there's still a magic to it.

03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:05.500
I mean, I see scientists, some of my colleagues,

03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:06.980
do this as well too.

03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:10.780
Like where, what is spirituality compared to science?

03:04:10.780 --> 03:04:15.020
And so I, my own feeling in this is that,

03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:18.580
as a scientist, cause I've had the pleasure

03:04:18.580 --> 03:04:21.380
of being able to like both understand

03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:22.700
what my predecessors did,

03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:24.540
but I also had the privilege of being able

03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:26.860
to discover things, right, as a scientist.

03:04:26.860 --> 03:04:30.500
And I see that, and you just,

03:04:30.500 --> 03:04:32.540
in just the range of our conversations,

03:04:32.540 --> 03:04:35.820
like that is my, in a weird way,

03:04:35.820 --> 03:04:39.340
it's the awe that comes from looking at that.

03:04:39.340 --> 03:04:43.620
That is, if you're not in awe of the universe and nature,

03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:45.020
you haven't been paying attention.

03:04:45.020 --> 03:04:48.020
I mean, my own personal feeling is that I feel,

03:04:49.300 --> 03:04:53.460
if I go snorkeling on a coral reef,

03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:56.940
I feel more awe than I could ever feel like in a church.

03:04:56.940 --> 03:04:59.980
You kind of notice some kind of magic there.

03:04:59.980 --> 03:05:01.220
There's something about the way

03:05:01.220 --> 03:05:03.620
the whole darn thing holds together

03:05:03.620 --> 03:05:06.700
that just sort of escapes your imagination.

03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:09.780
And that's, to me, this thing of,

03:05:09.780 --> 03:05:10.900
and then we have different words,

03:05:10.900 --> 03:05:13.420
we call them holistic or spiritual,

03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:15.180
the way that it all hangs together.

03:05:15.180 --> 03:05:16.580
In fact, one of the issues,

03:05:16.580 --> 03:05:18.300
you asked about like what I think about,

03:05:18.300 --> 03:05:20.180
one of the craziest things that I think,

03:05:20.180 --> 03:05:23.380
that how does it hold together is like our society.

03:05:23.380 --> 03:05:25.780
Like how does, what?

03:05:25.780 --> 03:05:28.260
Like how, cause there's no way,

03:05:28.300 --> 03:05:29.980
like you just think of the United States,

03:05:29.980 --> 03:05:34.980
there's 330 million people kind of working like this engine

03:05:35.540 --> 03:05:38.620
about going towards making all these things happen.

03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:41.900
But there's like no one in charge of this really, right?

03:05:41.900 --> 03:05:44.060
How the heck does this happen?

03:05:44.060 --> 03:05:47.020
It's kind of like, it's, so these things,

03:05:47.020 --> 03:05:48.780
these are the kinds of things mathematically

03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:51.780
and organization-wise that I think of

03:05:51.780 --> 03:05:54.540
just because they're sort of, they're awe-inspiring.

03:05:54.540 --> 03:05:57.780
And there's different ideas that would come up together

03:05:57.780 --> 03:06:01.060
and we share them and then there's teams of people

03:06:01.060 --> 03:06:03.140
that share different ideas and those ideas compete.

03:06:03.140 --> 03:06:04.860
Like there's the ideas themselves

03:06:04.860 --> 03:06:06.260
are these kinds of different organisms

03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:08.700
and ultimately somehow we build bridges

03:06:08.700 --> 03:06:10.100
and nuclear reactors.

03:06:10.100 --> 03:06:10.940
And do those things.

03:06:10.940 --> 03:06:13.300
Well, I have to give a shout out to my daughter, by the way,

03:06:13.300 --> 03:06:16.100
who's interested, she's an applied math major

03:06:16.100 --> 03:06:17.860
and she's amazing at math.

03:06:17.860 --> 03:06:19.180
And over the break, she was showing me

03:06:19.180 --> 03:06:23.420
she's doing research and it's basically about how ideas

03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:27.060
and ethos are transmitted within a society.

03:06:27.060 --> 03:06:29.340
So she's building an applied math model

03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:32.060
that is explaining like, she was showing me

03:06:32.060 --> 03:06:34.740
in this simulation, she goes, oh, look, look at this.

03:06:34.740 --> 03:06:37.620
And I said, oh, oh, that's like how political parties

03:06:37.620 --> 03:06:39.380
like evolve, right?

03:06:39.380 --> 03:06:40.740
And even though it was a rather, you know,

03:06:40.740 --> 03:06:44.180
quote unquote simple mathematical model, it wasn't really.

03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:45.820
It's like, oh, wow.

03:06:46.980 --> 03:06:49.860
Well, maybe she has a chance to derive mathematically

03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:52.500
the answer to what's the meaning of life.

03:06:52.500 --> 03:06:53.340
There we go.

03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:54.420
And maybe it is indeed 42.

03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:59.420
Well, Dennis, thank you so much for just doing,

03:06:59.420 --> 03:07:04.220
creating tools, creating systems, exploring this idea.

03:07:04.220 --> 03:07:07.140
That's one of the most amazing magical ideas

03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:10.780
in all of human endeavor, which is nuclear fusion.

03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:12.900
I mean, that's so interesting.

03:07:12.900 --> 03:07:16.260
You know, it's almost like my, one of my lifelong goals

03:07:16.260 --> 03:07:18.660
is like to make it, it's like, it's not magic.

03:07:18.660 --> 03:07:20.500
It's like, it's boring as all heck.

03:07:20.580 --> 03:07:24.340
And this means we're using it everywhere, right?

03:07:24.340 --> 03:07:25.420
Yeah.

03:07:25.420 --> 03:07:27.980
And the magic is then built on top of it.

03:07:27.980 --> 03:07:29.940
Well, thank you for everything you do.

03:07:29.940 --> 03:07:30.780
Thank you for talking to me.

03:07:30.780 --> 03:07:31.620
It's a huge honor.

03:07:31.620 --> 03:07:33.980
This was a fascinating and amazing conversation.

03:07:33.980 --> 03:07:35.500
Thank you.

03:07:35.500 --> 03:07:36.940
Thanks for listening to this conversation

03:07:36.940 --> 03:07:38.220
with Dennis White.

03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:44.060
And now let me leave you with some words

03:07:44.060 --> 03:07:45.420
from Albert Einstein.

03:07:46.340 --> 03:07:48.740
There are two ways to live your life.

03:07:48.740 --> 03:07:51.540
One is as though nothing is a miracle.

03:07:51.540 --> 03:07:54.900
The other is though everything's a miracle.

03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:55.980
Thank you for listening.

03:07:55.980 --> 03:07:57.860
I hope to see you next time.
