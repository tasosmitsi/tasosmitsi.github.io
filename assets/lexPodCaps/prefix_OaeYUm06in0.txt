00:01.000 --> 00:04.200
Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

00:07.360 --> 00:10.520
The following is a conversation with Karl Deisseroth,

00:10.520 --> 00:12.560
professor of bioengineering, psychiatry,

00:12.560 --> 00:15.600
and behavioral sciences at Stanford University.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.160
He's one of the greatest living psychiatrists

00:18.160 --> 00:20.480
and neuroscientists in the world.

00:20.480 --> 00:23.560
He's also just a fascinating human being.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.360
We discuss both the darkest and the most beautiful places

00:26.360 --> 00:28.640
that the human mind can take us.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.920
He explores this in his book called Projections,

00:31.920 --> 00:33.920
A Story of Human Emotions.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.840
I highly recommend it.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.360
It's written masterfully.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.320
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:42.240 --> 00:43.440
in the description.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.280
And now, dear friends, here's Karl Deisseroth.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.680
You open your book called Projections,

00:50.680 --> 00:51.920
A Story of Human Emotions,

00:51.920 --> 00:56.160
with a few beautiful words to summarize all of humanity.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.240
The book draws insights about the human mind

00:58.840 --> 01:01.280
from modern psychiatry and neuroscience.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.120
So if it's okay,

01:02.120 --> 01:05.080
let me read a few sentences from the opening.

01:05.080 --> 01:08.840
You gotta give props to beautiful writing when I see it.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.520
Quote, in the art of weaving,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.680
warped threads are structural and strong

01:14.680 --> 01:17.040
and anchored at the origin,

01:17.040 --> 01:19.280
creating a frame for crossing fibers

01:19.280 --> 01:21.120
as the fabric is woven.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.280
Projecting across the advancing edge into free space,

01:25.280 --> 01:27.920
warped threads bridge the formed past

01:27.920 --> 01:29.320
to the ragged present,

01:29.320 --> 01:31.200
to the yet featureless future.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.760
Yet featureless future.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.600
Well done.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.800
Well done, sir.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.920
The tapestry of the human story has its own warped threads

01:38.920 --> 01:41.600
rooted deep in the gorges of East Africa,

01:41.600 --> 01:44.320
connecting the shifting textures of human life

01:44.320 --> 01:46.440
over millions of years,

01:46.440 --> 01:50.240
spanning pictographs backdrop by creviced ice,

01:50.240 --> 01:52.760
by angulated forestry,

01:52.760 --> 01:54.080
by stone and steel,

01:54.080 --> 01:56.120
and by glowing rare earths.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.480
The inner workings of the mind give form to these threads,

01:59.480 --> 02:02.040
creating a framework within us

02:02.040 --> 02:03.760
upon which the story of each individual

02:03.760 --> 02:04.920
can come into being.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.840
Personal grain and color arise

02:07.840 --> 02:11.320
from the cross threads of our moments and experiences,

02:11.320 --> 02:13.520
the fine weft of life,

02:13.520 --> 02:16.680
embedding and obscuring the underlying scaffold

02:16.680 --> 02:19.720
with intricate and sometimes lovely detail.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.440
Here are stories of this fabric fraying

02:22.440 --> 02:24.800
in those who are ill,

02:24.800 --> 02:28.240
in the minds of people for whom the warp is exposed

02:28.240 --> 02:31.160
and raw and revealing.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.000
What have you learned about human beings,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.560
human nature, and the human mind

02:34.560 --> 02:38.240
from those who suffer from psychiatric maladies

02:38.240 --> 02:41.240
for those for whom this fabric is warped?

02:41.240 --> 02:43.440
And one thing we learn as biologists

02:43.440 --> 02:45.560
is that when something breaks,

02:45.560 --> 02:50.560
you see what the original unbroken part was for.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.160
And we see this in genetics,

02:52.160 --> 02:54.040
we see this in biochemistry.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.440
It's known that when you have a mutated gene,

02:57.440 --> 02:59.880
sometimes the gene is turned up in strength,

02:59.880 --> 03:01.320
they're turned down in strength,

03:01.320 --> 03:03.280
and that lets you see what it was originally for.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.960
You can infer true function from dysfunction.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.160
And this is a theme that I thought needed to be shared

03:11.160 --> 03:14.520
and needed to be made communicable to the lay public,

03:14.520 --> 03:15.840
to everybody, people who,

03:16.800 --> 03:19.440
which is, I think, almost all of us

03:19.440 --> 03:21.800
who think and care about the inner workings of our mind,

03:21.800 --> 03:26.360
but who also care for those who have been suffering,

03:26.360 --> 03:31.360
who have mental health disorders, who face challenges.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.760
But then more broadly,

03:33.760 --> 03:36.720
it's a very much larger story than the present.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.960
There's a story to be told

03:39.960 --> 03:42.200
where the protagonist really is the human mind.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.400
And that was one thing I wanted to share as well

03:44.400 --> 03:47.400
in projections is that broader story,

03:47.400 --> 03:50.480
but still anchored in the moment of patients,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.960
of people, of experiences of the moment.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.320
Is there a clear line between dysfunction and function,

03:57.320 --> 03:58.600
disorder and order?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.440
This is always debated in psychiatry,

04:02.440 --> 04:05.560
probably more so than any other medical specialty.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.680
I'm a psychiatrist, I treat patients still.

04:09.680 --> 04:14.320
I see acutely ill people who come to the emergency room

04:14.320 --> 04:15.440
where there's no doubt

04:15.440 --> 04:17.760
that this is not something that's working well,

04:17.800 --> 04:21.360
where the manifestation of disease is so powerful,

04:21.360 --> 04:23.000
where the person is suffering so greatly,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.720
where they cannot continue as they are.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.040
But of course it's a spectrum

04:28.040 --> 04:31.440
and there are people who are closer to the realm

04:31.440 --> 04:34.600
of being able to work okay in their jobs,

04:34.600 --> 04:36.320
but suffer from some small dysfunction.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.880
And everywhere in between.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.440
In psychiatry, we're careful to say,

04:39.440 --> 04:41.200
we don't call it a disease or disorder

04:41.200 --> 04:43.240
unless there's a disruption

04:43.240 --> 04:46.400
in social or occupational functioning.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.360
But of course, psychiatry has a long way to go

04:49.360 --> 04:51.840
in terms of developing quantitative tests.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.720
We don't have blood draws,

04:54.720 --> 04:57.840
we don't have imaging studies that we can use to diagnose.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.960
And so that line ultimately that you're asking about

05:00.960 --> 05:04.480
between order and disorder, function and dysfunction,

05:04.480 --> 05:05.840
it's operational at the moment.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.000
How are things working?

05:08.480 --> 05:10.840
Can we just like linger on the terms for a second?

05:10.840 --> 05:15.480
So this disease, dysfunction,

05:15.480 --> 05:18.000
how careful should we be using those words?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.240
Can we just, even in this conversation,

05:21.600 --> 05:24.440
from a sort of technical perspective,

05:24.440 --> 05:26.600
but also a human perspective,

05:26.600 --> 05:31.400
how quick should we be

05:31.400 --> 05:36.400
in saying that schizophrenia, depression, autism,

05:38.960 --> 05:42.880
as we kind of go down across the spectrum

05:42.880 --> 05:44.600
of different maladies,

05:44.600 --> 05:48.720
like just to use the word dysfunction and disease?

05:48.720 --> 05:50.760
I would say to give ourselves license

05:50.760 --> 05:53.000
to capture the whole spectrum, let's say disorder,

05:53.000 --> 05:57.160
because that captures truly, I think, the essence of it,

05:57.160 --> 05:59.640
which is we need to talk about it when it's not working,

05:59.640 --> 06:00.680
when there's disorder.

06:00.680 --> 06:05.680
And that's the fairest and most inclusive term to use.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.080
So is it fair to assume that basically

06:11.120 --> 06:14.160
every member of the human species suffers

06:14.160 --> 06:17.360
from a large number of disorders then?

06:17.360 --> 06:18.200
Well.

06:18.200 --> 06:22.040
And we just have to pick which ones are debilitating

06:22.040 --> 06:23.120
for each person?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.200
You know, if you look at the numbers,

06:25.200 --> 06:29.880
there are, if you look at how our mental health disorders

06:29.880 --> 06:30.840
are currently defined,

06:30.840 --> 06:34.560
you can look at population prevalence values

06:34.560 --> 06:35.560
for all these disorders.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.880
And you can come up with estimates

06:37.880 --> 06:42.200
that somebody will have a lifetime prevalence

06:42.200 --> 06:46.920
of having a psychiatric disorder that approaches 25% or so.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.200
And so that's, and in some studies it could be more,

06:50.200 --> 06:51.480
some studies it could be less.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.320
Now, what do we do with that number?

06:53.320 --> 06:54.160
What does that mean?

06:54.160 --> 06:55.560
And in some ways, that's the essence

06:55.560 --> 06:58.920
of what I was hoping to approach with the book

06:58.920 --> 07:00.640
is to reflect on this spectrum

07:00.640 --> 07:02.040
that exists for all the disorders.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.680
There is, and then taking nothing away

07:04.680 --> 07:06.080
from the severity and the suffering

07:06.080 --> 07:08.640
that comes at the extreme end of these illnesses,

07:08.640 --> 07:11.160
but nearly every one of them exists on a spectrum

07:11.160 --> 07:14.920
of severity from nearly functional

07:14.920 --> 07:17.360
to completely dysfunctional, life-threatening,

07:17.360 --> 07:19.240
and even fatal.

07:19.240 --> 07:22.520
And so that number, 25% more or less,

07:22.520 --> 07:27.520
it doesn't capture that spectrum of severity.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.960
To linger that number,

07:28.960 --> 07:30.480
where did those numbers come from?

07:30.480 --> 07:31.320
Is it self-reported?

07:31.320 --> 07:35.080
Is it people who show up and say, I need help?

07:35.120 --> 07:38.760
Is it somebody else that points out that person needs help?

07:38.760 --> 07:41.200
Or is it like estimates to even go beyond that

07:41.200 --> 07:42.920
for people who don't ask for help

07:42.920 --> 07:45.680
or are suffering quietly alone?

07:45.680 --> 07:47.240
When you look at self-report numbers,

07:47.240 --> 07:50.800
then those numbers get even higher, beyond 25% or more.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.680
Those, the most rigorous studies

07:54.680 --> 07:57.640
are done with structured psychiatric interviews

07:57.640 --> 08:01.600
where people who are trained in eliciting symptoms

08:01.640 --> 08:05.520
carefully do complete psychiatric inventories of individuals.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.560
And these are time-consuming, laborious studies

08:09.560 --> 08:10.880
that not often repeated.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.160
When they're done, they're done well.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.920
But very often you'll see a report of something in the news

08:16.920 --> 08:21.920
of a very high number for some disorder or symptom.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.520
And very often, if it's shockingly high,

08:24.520 --> 08:27.920
that's coming from a self-report of a person.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.400
And so that's another issue that we have.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.320
Again, take nothing away from the severity and reality

08:33.320 --> 08:35.880
and biological nature of these disorders,

08:35.880 --> 08:37.560
which are very genetic, very, you know,

08:37.560 --> 08:40.960
we understand that these are very biological.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.560
And yet we lack right now the lab tests

08:43.560 --> 08:45.440
and the blood draws to make the diagnosis.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.280
But we'll talk about it, just how biological they are.

08:48.280 --> 08:51.040
Cause it's a, that too is a mystery.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.800
I mean, you know, in terms of from our perspective

08:53.800 --> 08:55.400
of how to probe into the disease,

08:55.400 --> 08:57.680
how to understand it, how to help it.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.040
So some of it could be in your biological,

09:00.040 --> 09:04.920
some of it could be just the dance of human emotion

09:04.920 --> 09:07.440
and interaction and the, it's like,

09:09.480 --> 09:13.560
is love when it works and is love when it breaks down

09:13.560 --> 09:15.560
biological or is it something else?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.360
So we're gonna talk about it.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.480
But let me just like to linger in terms of disorder.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.600
What about genius?

09:23.600 --> 09:27.480
You know, that sort of cliche saying like the madness

09:27.480 --> 09:30.760
and genius that they kind of dance together.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.400
What about if the thing we see as disorder

09:33.400 --> 09:37.560
is actually genius, unheard or misunderstood?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.320
Well, here again, the numbers help us.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.760
And here's where being rigorous

09:41.760 --> 09:43.320
and quantitative actually really helps.

09:43.320 --> 09:47.520
If you look at disorders like autism and bipolar disorder

09:48.400 --> 09:52.120
and eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, for example,

09:53.200 --> 09:56.960
these, you know, particularly bipolar and anorexia,

09:56.960 --> 09:58.400
these can be fatal.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.800
They can cause immense suffering,

10:00.800 --> 10:04.520
but they are heavily genetic, all three of these.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.800
And what's very interesting is each one of these three

10:07.800 --> 10:10.480
is actually correlated positively,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.720
positively with measures of intelligence,

10:13.720 --> 10:18.280
of educational attainment and even of income.

10:18.280 --> 10:22.720
And so you look at this severe disorders in many cases

10:22.720 --> 10:26.360
causing quite an immense morbidity and mortality.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.960
And yet they are positively correlated

10:28.960 --> 10:31.240
at the population level with positive things.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.680
Can you say the three again, autism?

10:33.680 --> 10:37.360
Autism, anorexia and bipolar disorder.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.440
Bipolar, right.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.360
What's that book, forgot the book name,

10:40.360 --> 10:43.280
but is intelligence a burden?

10:43.280 --> 10:48.120
Well, you know, people can get into trouble

10:48.120 --> 10:49.600
when they think they're smarter than they are.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.560
I will say that.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
I don't know.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.880
Sometimes like in the deepest meaning of that statement,

10:56.880 --> 10:58.240
I think ignorance is bliss.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.960
I'm a big fan of Prince Mishkin from The Idiot

11:00.960 --> 11:04.440
and Ardorsha from Brother Karamazov.

11:04.440 --> 11:08.120
Optimism can be seen as naivety and dumbness,

11:08.120 --> 11:12.080
but I think it's a kind of deep intelligence.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.960
Maybe inability to reason sort of about the mechanics

11:17.960 --> 11:20.680
of the world, but instead kind of feel the world.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.280
It seems like that's one of the paths to happiness.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.880
There is how much you think versus how much you feel.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.160
This comes up all the time.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.720
In medicine, we encounter this all the time.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.920
When you're day after day, you encounter this,

11:33.920 --> 11:36.600
you know, the abyss of suffering from patients.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.400
How much do you let yourself feel?

11:39.480 --> 11:44.480
Or how much do you make it abstract and objective

11:44.560 --> 11:46.560
and try to make it clinical?

11:46.560 --> 11:49.080
And that range, how you're able to move yourself

11:49.560 --> 11:52.200
on that spectrum is very important

11:52.200 --> 11:54.000
for survival as a physician.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.440
And the way you protect yourself and your feelings

11:58.440 --> 12:00.160
turns out to be very important.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.720
So you quote Finnegan's Wake,

12:02.720 --> 12:05.200
mad props for that James Joyce book.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.720
I took a class on James Joyce in college.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.600
I think I read parts of Finnegan Wake.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.440
I might've been on drugs or some kind,

12:12.440 --> 12:15.720
or I somehow got an A in that class,

12:15.720 --> 12:18.000
which probably refers to some kind of curve

12:18.000 --> 12:19.800
where nobody understood anything.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.400
The only thing I understood and really enjoyed

12:21.400 --> 12:23.360
is his short stories, The Dead.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.360
And then Ulysses, I kind of, I think,

12:26.360 --> 12:28.880
read a few Cliffs Notes that kind of got to the point.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.400
And then Finnegan's Wake was just a hopeless person.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.680
For people who haven't looked at it,

12:35.680 --> 12:38.200
maybe you can elucidate to me better,

12:38.200 --> 12:43.200
but I felt like I was reading things, words,

12:43.400 --> 12:47.760
and the words made sense, like standing next to each other.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.520
But when you kind of read for a while,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.000
you realize you didn't actually understand

12:53.000 --> 12:54.080
anything that was said.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.880
Right, but did you have a feeling though?

12:55.880 --> 12:59.280
That's one thing I found interesting about Finnegan's Wake.

12:59.280 --> 13:00.600
I never fully understood it,

13:00.600 --> 13:02.240
but the words caused feelings in me,

13:02.240 --> 13:03.880
which I found fascinating.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.840
And sometimes I couldn't predict it

13:06.840 --> 13:09.680
from the semantic black and white context

13:09.680 --> 13:11.960
of what I was seeing in front of me on the page,

13:11.960 --> 13:14.520
but the rhythm or the melody would make me feel certain ways.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.600
And that was what I always was intrigued by with Joyce.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.880
Of course, that was his, he existed on a spectrum too.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.960
And he wrote, as you say, more accessible works.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.440
I learned a lot about Irish history

13:26.440 --> 13:28.720
from portrait of the artist as a young man.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.120
And there was just, he could be as objective

13:31.120 --> 13:32.320
as he wanted to be.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.240
But then when he let himself loose,

13:35.240 --> 13:39.800
he was in this realm where the words had their own purpose

13:39.800 --> 13:42.680
separate from semantic meaning,

13:42.680 --> 13:46.120
from their dry dictionary definition.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.400
You know, there's a funny story that was told,

13:48.400 --> 13:49.720
doesn't matter if it's true or not,

13:49.720 --> 13:53.040
but they said that James Joyce, when he was young,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.400
when he was in his teen years,

13:54.400 --> 13:57.800
would go around sort of Ireland drinking and so on,

13:57.800 --> 14:00.080
and telling everybody that he's going to be one of,

14:00.080 --> 14:03.080
if not the greatest writers of the 20th century.

14:03.080 --> 14:07.000
And he turned out to be that.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.760
So I always think about that little story

14:09.760 --> 14:11.720
that somebody told me,

14:11.720 --> 14:14.200
because I have a lot of people come up to me,

14:14.200 --> 14:16.280
including myself, I'm a bit of a dreamer.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.520
You get into certain moods where you say,

14:19.520 --> 14:22.800
I'm going to be the greatest anything ever.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.240
You get people tell you this, especially young people.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.240
And it kind of, it makes me feel all kinds of ways,

14:32.240 --> 14:36.320
but that story reminds me that you just might be

14:36.320 --> 14:39.440
one of the greatest writers of the 21st century,

14:39.440 --> 14:41.480
for example, if somebody were to tell me that.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.960
And don't immediately disregard that,

14:44.960 --> 14:47.320
because one of the people that say that,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
that's almost like a precondition,

14:49.320 --> 14:51.600
that's a good requirement just to believe in yourself.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.080
Maybe it's not a full requirement,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.240
but it's an interesting story.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.320
I think when someone tells you that,

14:58.320 --> 15:02.880
then it creates, one sees an opportunity,

15:02.880 --> 15:03.960
and then it would be a tragedy

15:03.960 --> 15:05.560
if the opportunity weren't captured, right?

15:05.560 --> 15:09.080
And so then that creates some impetus,

15:09.120 --> 15:12.040
some motivation to do something good.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.880
I think the mind, it's like,

15:14.920 --> 15:17.960
I guess that's what books like, or books or whatever,

15:17.960 --> 15:20.720
I don't even know if it's a book, The Secret plugs into,

15:20.720 --> 15:23.480
they kind of make a whole industry out of it.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.160
But there is something about the mind believing something,

15:27.160 --> 15:28.440
making it a reality.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.080
It is just time and time again with Steve Jobs,

15:32.080 --> 15:35.880
your belief in yourself, your belief in an idea,

15:35.920 --> 15:39.120
sort of embracing the me versus the world,

15:39.120 --> 15:42.040
embracing the madness of this idea

15:42.040 --> 15:44.480
and making it a life pursuit.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.480
Somehow morphs reality around,

15:46.480 --> 15:48.640
for some tiny fraction of the population,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.960
for everybody else, you descend into

15:54.080 --> 15:56.720
all the beautiful ways that failure

15:56.720 --> 15:59.400
materializes in our lifetime.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.960
Well, you know, you mentioned love earlier.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.160
I mean, that's a great example of how belief in something

16:04.160 --> 16:05.680
makes it real, right?

16:06.520 --> 16:08.240
It's not reasonable on the face of it,

16:08.240 --> 16:09.600
but because you believe it's reasonable,

16:09.600 --> 16:10.960
then it actually does become reasonable

16:10.960 --> 16:11.800
and then it is real.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.160
And so that's a good example.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.000
That doesn't happen.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
I'm also in a bioengineering department.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.520
We don't imagine that a bridge is soundly built

16:18.520 --> 16:19.560
and that it is soundly built.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.200
That's something that,

16:21.200 --> 16:23.320
it doesn't come up in too many realms of human existence,

16:23.320 --> 16:24.560
but love is one of them.

16:24.560 --> 16:29.560
And the ability to have a fixed idea

16:29.600 --> 16:32.440
and to say it's true and then it is true.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.640
A bridge is a kind of manifestation of love.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.000
Maybe it does work a little bit,

16:36.000 --> 16:38.360
but it can break down like Chernobyl did.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.200
You can't just say it's safe.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.320
You have to also prove it's safe.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.400
But on Finnegans Wake,

16:45.400 --> 16:47.120
I think, maybe correct me if I'm wrong,

16:47.120 --> 16:48.760
you're using kind of Finnegans Wake

16:48.760 --> 16:52.320
to give one perspective on what madness is

16:52.320 --> 16:53.760
of what's going on in the mind.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.080
How much of that is

16:57.000 --> 17:00.400
that we're simply unable to communicate

17:00.400 --> 17:03.800
with the person on the other side of their mind?

17:04.000 --> 17:07.600
There's almost like a little person inside the brain

17:07.600 --> 17:09.640
and they have some circuitry

17:09.640 --> 17:11.760
that's used to communicate emotion,

17:11.760 --> 17:14.080
communicate ideas to the outside world.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.680
And there's something about that circuitry

17:15.680 --> 17:17.200
that makes it difficult to communicate

17:17.200 --> 17:18.920
with the little person on the other side.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.240
So if you look at what shows up in schizophrenia

17:21.240 --> 17:25.200
with many cases, what we call thought disorders,

17:25.200 --> 17:30.200
what we call the individual speech symptoms of schizophrenia,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.720
Finnegans Wake is loaded with them.

17:34.640 --> 17:35.480
And it's just full of them.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.880
We talk about clang associations in schizophrenia

17:39.880 --> 17:44.000
where the word that is said echoes in some way

17:44.000 --> 17:44.840
the previous word.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.920
And we call that a clang association

17:46.920 --> 17:47.880
because there's no other reason

17:47.880 --> 17:49.320
than the similarity of the sound,

17:49.320 --> 17:52.800
like a clang of a garage door being hit.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.600
And sometimes it's not even a word

17:56.600 --> 17:59.960
and we call that a neologism, a new word being created.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.200
And of course, Finnegans Wake is full of that.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.240
And then we also in schizophrenia

18:05.240 --> 18:07.000
where there's what we call loose associations

18:07.000 --> 18:10.040
or tangential thought processes,

18:10.040 --> 18:11.880
of course, full of that where things just go off

18:11.880 --> 18:15.320
in directions that are not linear or logical.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.680
And you can't read Finnegans Wake, I think,

18:18.680 --> 18:21.520
without certainly as a psychiatrist,

18:21.520 --> 18:24.160
you can't read it without thinking about schizophrenia.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.440
And then when we look at the families of people

18:27.440 --> 18:30.560
with schizophrenia and Joyce was no exception,

18:30.600 --> 18:32.640
there very often are people within the family

18:32.640 --> 18:33.920
who are on the spectrum.

18:33.920 --> 18:38.920
Some have it, some are able to see it from a distance,

18:39.160 --> 18:40.880
from a safe distance.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.080
There's an association between schizophrenia

18:43.080 --> 18:46.680
and what we call Schizotypal Personality Disorder

18:46.680 --> 18:48.120
where people are not quite

18:48.120 --> 18:50.560
in this severe state of schizophrenia

18:50.560 --> 18:51.960
but have some magical thinking,

18:51.960 --> 18:54.600
have some unusual thought patterns.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.080
Very often those are family members

18:56.080 --> 18:57.720
of people with schizophrenia.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.240
So this points to this, again, to this idea

19:00.800 --> 19:05.800
that there is a range even along this very severe,

19:05.840 --> 19:07.520
very genetic biological illness

19:07.520 --> 19:10.280
that human beings dwell on different spots

19:10.280 --> 19:11.520
along that spectrum.

19:11.520 --> 19:14.400
I should mention that we have my friend Sergey

19:14.400 --> 19:16.880
pulling up stuff, young Sergey or old Sergey,

19:16.880 --> 19:17.800
I don't know what to call you,

19:17.800 --> 19:21.760
but there's drafts of Finnegans Wake.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.120
Yeah, I actually saw pictures of this from,

19:25.520 --> 19:27.120
I think it was on Instagram or something.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.280
These are early drafts of Finnegans Wake

19:29.320 --> 19:30.440
and it's so beautiful to see

19:30.440 --> 19:32.040
for people who are just listening,

19:32.040 --> 19:34.400
there's just random paragraphs

19:34.400 --> 19:37.160
and writing all over the page with stuff crossed out

19:37.160 --> 19:40.320
and it's great to see that Joyce himself

19:40.320 --> 19:42.000
was thinking in this kind of way

19:42.000 --> 19:44.840
as you're putting it together.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.040
How much do you think he was thinking

19:46.040 --> 19:48.400
about the schizophrenic mind?

19:48.400 --> 19:49.240
I think a lot.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.600
I think it's known that his daughter suffered

19:51.600 --> 19:55.240
from schizophrenia and this is,

19:55.240 --> 19:56.920
what's depicted here on the page

19:56.920 --> 20:00.640
is something that I'm sure he either felt himself

20:00.640 --> 20:03.480
and some level was able to access

20:03.480 --> 20:06.320
this non-linearity of processing

20:06.320 --> 20:10.600
or had seen enough in family that he knew what it was

20:10.600 --> 20:13.400
and was able to reflect it down

20:13.400 --> 20:14.600
in black and white on the paper.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.680
So what he was able to do was quite authentic

20:17.680 --> 20:19.280
in that sense.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.920
Of course, I don't wanna pigeonhole him,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.800
he was doing much more than that.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.560
It was much more than talking about

20:26.560 --> 20:31.360
altered human thought processes and thought disorders,

20:31.360 --> 20:34.840
but that was an aspect that he was so good at representing

20:34.840 --> 20:37.600
that it had to be intentional to some extent.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.760
In a tiny tangent,

20:38.760 --> 20:42.040
what is your own writing look like for this book?

20:42.040 --> 20:44.280
Cause it's extremely well written.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.160
How many edits, did you just drink some whiskey

20:48.160 --> 20:51.480
and like I'm imagining Hemingway style?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.520
What's a very different, the writing is very different.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.720
I mean, it's really, really well written,

20:55.720 --> 21:00.240
which was like, I was reading it.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.240
It makes you realize,

21:01.240 --> 21:03.640
cause I was expecting sort of a science kind of,

21:03.640 --> 21:07.600
which it is like, you know,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.920
elucidating something about the human mind kind of thing.

21:09.920 --> 21:14.920
But you could also probably write really strong novels.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.000
So maybe that's in the future.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.240
But anyway, what is your, how many edits,

21:19.240 --> 21:20.320
how many, what's your style?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.360
Does it look like that?

21:21.360 --> 21:22.920
Is it more structured, organized?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.480
Unfortunately, I used a laptop,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.520
so I didn't have this sort of a beautiful record.

21:26.520 --> 21:29.560
No typewriter, cigarette and whiskey.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.440
I did explore, I was, you know,

21:31.440 --> 21:33.200
which was their particular altered state

21:33.200 --> 21:34.920
that would help me to be most creative.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.920
And I found actually, I actually did the best while,

21:39.760 --> 21:42.680
you know, sober, but slightly disinhibited

21:42.680 --> 21:46.360
in the late hours of the night or early morning.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.240
Yeah, particularly late hours of the night there.

21:49.240 --> 21:52.440
You know, I have a friend who would tell me

21:52.760 --> 21:54.760
she thought that very early in the morning,

21:54.760 --> 21:57.200
her inner critic was still asleep

21:57.200 --> 21:59.320
and she could write more effectively

21:59.320 --> 22:01.360
before her inner critic woke up.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.880
And I actually found that outstanding advice for me

22:03.880 --> 22:05.920
that I often found that there was,

22:05.920 --> 22:09.400
I was looser and could write more in the morning.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.160
But the other interesting thing is each chapter,

22:12.160 --> 22:15.560
each story, it's about a different human being

22:15.560 --> 22:18.520
with a different class of psychiatric disorder.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.920
That's what each story, each chapter is anchored in.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.720
But I'm trying to use words that,

22:25.720 --> 22:30.080
and style of writing and, you know,

22:30.080 --> 22:32.960
diction that captures the feeling of the disorder.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.880
And so it's different in each story.

22:34.880 --> 22:39.520
In the story about mania, which is a very expansive,

22:39.520 --> 22:43.240
exuberant, at least briefly uplifting state

22:43.240 --> 22:45.200
where the words come out on a torrent

22:45.240 --> 22:48.600
and they're complex and pressured and elaborate.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.280
I try to capture that feeling

22:50.280 --> 22:52.480
with the words used in that chapter.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.560
And then in the schizophrenia or psychosis chapter

22:56.560 --> 22:58.440
where things slowly fragment over time

22:58.440 --> 23:01.840
and become looser and separated,

23:01.840 --> 23:03.840
I tried to capture that in the writing too.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.720
So for each, it wasn't as if there was a single mode

23:06.720 --> 23:08.320
I could be in for the whole book.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.240
For each chapter, I had to put myself into a different mode

23:11.240 --> 23:14.400
to capture that inner feeling of the disorder.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.680
I mean, you put yourself in that mode.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.520
Does that change you?

23:17.520 --> 23:19.880
Yeah, I couldn't turn it on and off right away.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.880
I had to, first I would start by thinking about the person

23:23.880 --> 23:26.200
or the people, one or two people based on real patients

23:26.200 --> 23:29.960
and the stories that are put forth.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.360
The symptom descriptions are real.

23:31.360 --> 23:32.240
They're from the patients.

23:32.240 --> 23:35.400
Of course, all details change to protect privacy,

23:35.400 --> 23:38.040
but the actual symptom descriptions are real.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.240
And I would sit with them and really try to inhabit

23:41.400 --> 23:45.600
the space of the mind of that person that I knew.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.480
And that's not instantaneous.

23:47.480 --> 23:48.800
It would take some time.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.640
I needed quiet.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.160
I needed to be still.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.640
That's another reason late at night is good.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.760
Sergey posted that drowsiness gives creativity boosts

23:56.760 --> 23:58.800
according to Andrew Huberman.

23:58.800 --> 23:59.640
Thank you, Andrew.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.480
He's not wrong.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.320
He's not wrong.

24:03.320 --> 24:04.760
Why projections?

24:04.760 --> 24:07.440
Is it, I mean, there's,

24:07.440 --> 24:09.840
instead of putting words into your mouth,

24:09.960 --> 24:11.360
because I can imagine a lot.

24:11.360 --> 24:15.760
I mean, to me, I will start putting words in your mouth

24:15.760 --> 24:17.000
despite what I just said.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.560
So, I mean, to me, projections,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.080
working on neural networks, for example,

24:22.080 --> 24:23.400
from artificial neural networks,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.320
from a machine learning perspective,

24:25.320 --> 24:27.600
it's often, that's exactly what you're doing.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.360
You have an incredibly complex thing

24:29.360 --> 24:33.000
and you're trying to find simple representations

24:33.000 --> 24:34.720
in order for you to make sense of it.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.840
So I was kind of thinking about in that way,

24:36.840 --> 24:41.840
which is like this incredibly complex neural network

24:43.160 --> 24:47.000
that is kind of projecting itself onto the world

24:47.000 --> 24:50.560
through this low bandwidth expression of emotion

24:50.560 --> 24:52.360
and speech and all that kind of stuff.

24:52.360 --> 24:57.080
And the way it, we only have that window into your soul,

24:57.080 --> 24:58.520
the eyes and the speech and so on.

24:58.520 --> 25:03.520
So that, in that way, when there's any kind of disorder,

25:04.560 --> 25:06.360
we get to only see that disorder

25:06.360 --> 25:08.200
through that narrow window

25:08.200 --> 25:11.120
as opposed to the full complexity of its origins.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.920
The word projections definitely serves that purpose here,

25:13.920 --> 25:17.680
but it's got a few other really appropriate

25:17.680 --> 25:19.400
other connotations as well.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.960
So the first thing is a projection

25:20.960 --> 25:24.840
in terms of neuroscience is this long range connection

25:24.840 --> 25:26.920
that goes from one part of the brain to another.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.600
And so it's what binds two parts of our brain together.

25:30.600 --> 25:33.960
There are projections, long range connections of axons.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.360
These are the outgoing threads that connect

25:37.360 --> 25:39.760
one part of the brain to another part.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.920
There's a projection that links, for example,

25:41.920 --> 25:44.160
auditory cortex, where we hear things,

25:44.160 --> 25:46.960
to reward centers where we can feel

25:46.960 --> 25:50.080
where feelings of pleasure and reward are initiated.

25:50.080 --> 25:53.480
And it's been shown that if you have reduced connectivity

25:53.480 --> 25:56.520
along that dimension, you are less able to enjoy music.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.720
And so these connections, these projections matter.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.880
They define how effectively two parts of the brain

26:01.880 --> 26:04.520
can engage with each other and join together

26:04.520 --> 26:07.760
to form a joint representation of something.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.360
So that's one meaning it's pure neuroscience.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.440
The word projection is used all the time.

26:11.440 --> 26:13.800
And it happens to be something that optogenetics,

26:13.800 --> 26:16.040
a technique that we maybe we'll talk about a little later,

26:16.040 --> 26:17.200
it works particularly well with.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.960
We can use light to turn on or off the activity

26:19.960 --> 26:22.200
along these projections from one spot of the brain

26:22.200 --> 26:23.040
to another.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.080
And this is particularly referring

26:24.080 --> 26:25.840
to the long range connections.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.360
It's particularly straightforward

26:27.360 --> 26:28.720
along these long range projections

26:28.720 --> 26:29.840
that connect different parts of the brain,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.040
it works over shorter range too.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.120
But then there's this other meaning of projections

26:34.120 --> 26:35.760
which you were bringing up, which is very relevant,

26:35.760 --> 26:39.040
which is at some point you can reduce something

26:39.040 --> 26:41.120
from one level of dimensionality to another.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.000
And you can project down

26:42.000 --> 26:44.840
into a lower dimensional space, for example.

26:44.840 --> 26:49.200
And then finally, there's a psychiatric term projections,

26:49.200 --> 26:50.200
which comes up all the time,

26:50.200 --> 26:55.200
which is we very often will look at our internal states

26:56.440 --> 26:57.720
and to understand somebody else,

26:57.720 --> 27:00.520
we'll project them onto somebody else.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.800
We'll try to understand someone else's behavior

27:02.800 --> 27:06.440
and make sense of it by projecting our own inner feelings,

27:06.440 --> 27:10.880
our own sort of narrative onto them

27:10.880 --> 27:15.040
and use that as a way to help us understand them better.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.120
And we'll do the reverse too.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.400
We'll take things we see in the outside world

27:18.400 --> 27:19.640
and we'll bring them into ourselves

27:19.640 --> 27:21.480
and see how well they map, how well they align.

27:21.480 --> 27:23.200
That's called introjection.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.840
So projections turns out to be a really rich word.

27:25.840 --> 27:26.680
And then finally, of course,

27:26.680 --> 27:30.080
there's the very common sense of it as a projector

27:30.080 --> 27:33.560
that illuminates by conveying information

27:33.560 --> 27:35.920
across space with light.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.200
So for English language, perfect word to use for this book,

27:40.200 --> 27:42.360
but what was funny is not every,

27:43.280 --> 27:45.000
there are a lot of international translations now

27:45.000 --> 27:46.760
and all those rich connotations

27:46.760 --> 27:48.640
aren't captured in other languages.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.920
And so for some translations,

27:51.920 --> 27:54.400
connections is used instead of projections.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.120
In fact, even in England,

27:56.120 --> 27:58.320
the British version is connections instead of projections

27:58.320 --> 28:00.040
because apparently projections

28:00.040 --> 28:02.640
doesn't have the full connotation I was told.

28:02.640 --> 28:06.560
So you have to sacrifice some of the rich ambiguity

28:06.560 --> 28:08.880
of meaning with connections.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.920
That's interesting.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.680
I mean, and words are so interesting.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.000
They could have so many me.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.960
I love language and how much is lost in translation.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.760
I'm very fortunate enough to be able to speak.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.760
I'm not good at languages.

28:20.760 --> 28:24.560
I was just, I guess, forced to by life circumstance

28:24.560 --> 28:27.760
to learn two languages, Russian and English.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.680
And it's just so interesting to watch how much of culture,

28:30.680 --> 28:32.720
how much of people, how much of history

28:32.720 --> 28:34.280
is lost in translation.

28:35.280 --> 28:40.000
The poetry, the music, the history, the pain,

28:40.000 --> 28:41.920
the way the scientists actually express themselves,

28:41.920 --> 28:43.040
which is funny.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.280
I mean, it's so sad

28:46.280 --> 28:51.280
to see how much brilliant work that was written in Russian.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.840
There's a whole culture of science in the Soviet Union

28:56.840 --> 28:57.920
that is now lost.

28:57.920 --> 29:01.000
It makes me wonder in the modern day,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.120
how much incredible science is going on in China

29:05.040 --> 29:06.920
that is lost in translation.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.920
And I'll never, I mean, that makes me very sad

29:08.920 --> 29:13.360
because I'll never learn Chinese in the same way

29:13.360 --> 29:15.800
that I've learned English and Russian.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.400
Whenever I say stuff like that, people are like,

29:18.400 --> 29:19.760
well, there's still time.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.840
Yeah, that's actually fair.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.800
I think the 21st century,

29:28.800 --> 29:30.960
both China and US will have very important roles

29:30.960 --> 29:32.800
in the scientific development.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.880
And we should actually bridge the gap through language.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.440
And that doesn't just mean convincing Chinese

29:39.440 --> 29:40.680
to speak English.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.240
That means also learning Chinese.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.720
Well, we need these bridge people who can do both.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.960
The Nabokov, for example, writing in English beautifully.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.400
One of my favorite poets, Borges, who I mentioned earlier,

29:55.400 --> 29:57.880
he wrote both in English and in Spanish,

29:57.880 --> 30:00.800
I think beautifully in both.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.640
We need those people who can serve as bridges

30:03.640 --> 30:05.600
across cultures, he really can do both.

30:07.360 --> 30:08.440
You mentioned Borges.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.920
So you opened your book with a few lines from a poem

30:11.920 --> 30:15.920
by Jorge Luis Borges, a love poem.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.040
I'm gonna read parts of it,

30:17.040 --> 30:18.680
because it's a damn good poem.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.400
It's called Two English Poems.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.120
I mean, there's, I'd like to understand why you used it

30:24.120 --> 30:27.520
and the specific parts you used, which is interesting.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.480
But then when I read the full thing,

30:30.480 --> 30:35.480
so I think you used it as a sort of beautiful description

30:36.400 --> 30:39.840
of what it means to delve deep into understanding,

30:40.120 --> 30:42.480
offering yourself to the task of understanding

30:42.480 --> 30:44.000
another human being.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.040
But if you look at the full context of the poem,

30:46.040 --> 30:49.120
it's also a damn good description of being hit by love

30:49.120 --> 30:52.800
and overtaking by it and sort of,

30:52.800 --> 30:56.600
and trying to figure out how to make sense of the world

30:56.600 --> 30:59.360
now that you've been stricken by it.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.880
It says a bunch of things about chatting

31:03.880 --> 31:05.040
and significantly with friends

31:05.040 --> 31:06.080
and all those kinds of things.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.200
And then the poem reads,

31:08.200 --> 31:10.640
the big wave brought you,

31:10.640 --> 31:13.320
like this is the moment, I guess,

31:13.320 --> 31:16.760
of the universe where the two people, you fall in love.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.840
Maybe I'm totally misreading this poem, by the way.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.800
Doesn't matter, you can't misread the poem.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.400
That's right.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.920
So it goes on, words, any words, your laughter,

31:25.920 --> 31:28.920
and you so lazily and incessantly beautiful.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.920
We talked and you have forgotten the words.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.600
The shattering dawn finds me

31:33.600 --> 31:35.760
in a deserted street of my city.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.760
Your profile turned away.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.320
The sounds that go to make your name.

31:40.320 --> 31:42.160
The lilt of your laughter.

31:42.160 --> 31:45.280
These are the illustrious toys you have left me.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.480
So these little memories

31:46.480 --> 31:49.000
of these peculiar little details he remembers,

31:49.000 --> 31:51.080
those are the illustrious toys.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.200
I apologize to mix my own words with the poem,

31:53.200 --> 31:55.640
but you should definitely read it.

31:55.640 --> 31:57.800
I turn them over in the dawn.

31:57.800 --> 31:58.680
I lose them.

31:58.680 --> 31:59.840
I find them.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.760
I tell them to the few stray dogs

32:01.760 --> 32:03.960
and to the few stray stars of the dawn.

32:04.960 --> 32:08.720
Your dark rich life.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.240
I must get at you somehow.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.120
I put away those illustrious toys you have left me.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.640
I want your hidden look, your real smile.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.720
That lonely mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.

32:21.720 --> 32:24.800
I want your hidden look, your real smile.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.680
I haven't, so I, this is the first part of the poem

32:27.680 --> 32:29.040
and then it goes on,

32:29.040 --> 32:31.600
which is some of the parts that you reference.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.920
The second part is, what can I hold you with?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.400
I offer you lean streets, desperate sunsets,

32:37.400 --> 32:39.200
the moon of the jagged suburbs.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.000
I offer you the bitterness of a man

32:41.000 --> 32:44.120
who has looked long and long at a lonely moon.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.320
I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,

32:47.320 --> 32:50.240
the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.160
My father's father killed in the frontier of Buenos Aires.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.720
Two bullets through his lungs and so on, so on.

32:56.720 --> 32:59.360
I offer you whatever insights my books may hold,

33:00.360 --> 33:02.520
whatever manliness or humor in my life.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.760
I offer you the loyalty of a man who has never been loyal.

33:05.760 --> 33:08.000
I offer you that kernel of myself

33:08.000 --> 33:10.040
that I have saved somehow the central heart

33:10.040 --> 33:11.600
that deals not in words,

33:11.600 --> 33:14.040
traffics not with dreams,

33:14.040 --> 33:18.520
and is untouched by time, my joy and adversities.

33:18.520 --> 33:22.000
And I think this is the part that you include in the book.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.560
I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset,

33:25.560 --> 33:27.200
years before you were born.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.640
All right, damn, that's a good line.

33:30.640 --> 33:35.240
Okay, I offer you explanations of yourself,

33:35.240 --> 33:36.480
theories about yourself,

33:36.480 --> 33:39.040
authentic and surprising news of yourself.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.960
I can give you my loneliness, my darkness,

33:41.960 --> 33:43.520
the hunger of my heart.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.600
I'm trying to bribe you with uncertainty,

33:45.600 --> 33:47.680
with danger, with defeat.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.920
That is a man who's in love and longing.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.920
But I just wanna go back to,

33:52.920 --> 33:55.080
maybe you could say why you wanted to include that poem,

33:55.080 --> 34:00.040
but also your dark rich life I must get at you somehow.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.400
I put away those illustrious toys you have left me at.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.040
I want your hidden look, your real smile,

34:06.040 --> 34:09.000
that lonely mocking smile, your cool mirror nose.

34:09.000 --> 34:12.040
Sometimes I meet a stranger and I just,

34:13.280 --> 34:15.880
it's like a double take.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.760
It's like, who are you?

34:17.760 --> 34:19.440
Have we met before somewhere?

34:19.440 --> 34:22.240
Who's that person behind there?

34:22.240 --> 34:24.960
And I wanna get at that, whatever that is.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.000
And of course, maybe that's what love is

34:27.000 --> 34:30.200
because maybe that's the whole pursuit,

34:30.200 --> 34:32.360
like a lifelong pursuit of getting at that person.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.640
Maybe that's what that is.

34:33.640 --> 34:37.960
And like that insatiable sort of curiosity to keep getting,

34:37.960 --> 34:40.400
like, well, who's that person in your own private life?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.680
Yeah, so that, absolutely, I think that,

34:42.680 --> 34:44.920
it was a beautiful description of what you just said

34:44.920 --> 34:46.840
when there's that first moment

34:46.840 --> 34:48.880
and then you wanna dive deeper.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.160
You want to know what the hidden mysteries are.

34:52.160 --> 34:55.280
In a way, it's a love poem.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.560
As a scientist, though, it also,

34:58.480 --> 35:01.120
it's a bit of how a scientist can love science.

35:01.120 --> 35:06.120
And that wanting to dive deeper is,

35:07.560 --> 35:09.760
it's almost like, again, where the,

35:09.760 --> 35:10.840
it could be a love affair

35:10.840 --> 35:13.320
with investigating the human mind, for example.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.600
And that was one reason it spoke to me also.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.160
Again, thinking about the broader sweep

35:19.160 --> 35:20.920
of where the human mind came from,

35:21.920 --> 35:24.960
the steps it took to get where it is today,

35:24.960 --> 35:26.880
what was given up along the way,

35:26.880 --> 35:28.120
what compromises were made.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.720
And here's where the darkness of the poem

35:29.720 --> 35:31.440
starts to come in a little bit too.

35:31.440 --> 35:35.040
It doesn't shy away from the negativity,

35:35.040 --> 35:39.040
from the confusion, from the danger.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.320
And then at the very end,

35:42.080 --> 35:46.480
the board face is offering up scenes from his life,

35:46.480 --> 35:48.160
parts of himself.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.480
And this is how we connect with people.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.920
We offer up parts of ourselves, just here it is.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.640
And then we see how well does that map onto what you have.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.800
And it's that offering up that I liked

35:57.800 --> 36:00.400
and not the good stuff, or not only the good stuff.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.400
The yellow rose is nice,

36:01.400 --> 36:03.640
but he's offering up the bad stuff too.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.240
And that to me was important for the book

36:06.240 --> 36:10.000
because I'm offering up hard stuff too.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.200
In fact, a lot of it.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.440
And also hard stuff from within me,

36:13.440 --> 36:15.080
from my own personal side too.

36:15.080 --> 36:17.480
And that was, there's a lot of vulnerability

36:17.480 --> 36:18.320
that comes with that,

36:19.280 --> 36:21.280
that comes with love, that comes with writing.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.520
You have to be open, you have to be vulnerable.

36:23.520 --> 36:28.200
And so I thought that reflected what I was trying to do.

36:28.200 --> 36:29.720
And I thought it was as an epigraph,

36:29.720 --> 36:33.760
it kind of made it clear how vulnerable I was

36:33.760 --> 36:38.280
in taking this step, but also what could come out of it.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.600
And also in a meta way,

36:39.600 --> 36:41.720
because I was not familiar with this poem,

36:43.960 --> 36:47.640
it made me curious of the poem itself

36:47.680 --> 36:51.280
to pull at that thread of finding out more.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.360
You picked a very particular part

36:53.360 --> 36:57.680
that kind of made you want to pull at that thread

36:57.680 --> 37:02.680
and see where did these few lines come from?

37:02.960 --> 37:05.840
Because I read it as a curiosity of a scientist,

37:05.840 --> 37:08.400
those lines alone.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.400
And also as a desperate human being searching,

37:14.080 --> 37:17.360
like offering himself for understanding

37:18.200 --> 37:19.480
or a connection with another human being.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.960
And then, because I wasn't sure if it's a love poem or not,

37:21.960 --> 37:23.640
or if it's desperation or if it's curiosity,

37:23.640 --> 37:26.200
whatever it is, and then you see the love poem.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.280
I mean, I don't know, that's gonna stick with me

37:28.280 --> 37:32.160
for a while, your dark rich life.

37:32.160 --> 37:35.320
And then a few lines in here are just,

37:35.320 --> 37:37.960
I mean, those are, I'm gonna just use them

37:37.960 --> 37:40.200
as pick up lines at a bar.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.400
I offer you the memory of a yellow rose

37:42.400 --> 37:44.880
seen at sunset years before you were born.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.560
Now that's a pick up line if I've ever heard one.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.400
Anyway, sorry.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.440
But this is universal.

37:52.440 --> 37:55.480
You see it in so many forms of art.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.280
Like, we're in Texas now.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.560
You see this in country and Western songs.

38:00.560 --> 38:02.080
It's often a list of things.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.560
Like, here's how I describe myself.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.080
There's this and there's that and there's the other thing.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.280
And here you are.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.880
These things matter to me.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.240
And I hope they matter to you too.

38:09.240 --> 38:11.360
It's a pretty universal form.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.640
But he did it in this very artful

38:14.640 --> 38:16.760
and very vulnerable way.

38:16.760 --> 38:20.560
It was both beautiful and you could feel the hurt

38:20.560 --> 38:22.920
coming from him too, and that was important.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.280
The dark stuff too.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.760
I offer you my ancestors, my dead men,

38:26.760 --> 38:29.440
the ghosts that living men have honored in bronze

38:29.440 --> 38:32.280
and talking about two bullets through his lungs,

38:32.280 --> 38:36.640
bearded and dead, wrapped by his soldiers

38:36.640 --> 38:37.960
in the hide of a cow.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.360
A mother's grandfather, just 24,

38:40.360 --> 38:43.640
heading a charge of 300 men in Peru,

38:43.640 --> 38:47.000
now ghosts on vanished horses.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.120
So all of it, the whole history of it.

38:50.360 --> 38:51.840
Since it is a love poem,

38:52.680 --> 38:55.960
what do you think about love, Carl?

38:55.960 --> 38:58.680
What's the role of love in the human condition?

38:58.680 --> 39:00.680
We'll talk about the dark stuff.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.960
But maybe love is the dark stuff too.

39:02.960 --> 39:07.000
I mean, it's the most powerful connection we can form

39:07.000 --> 39:11.320
and that's what makes it so important to us.

39:11.320 --> 39:16.320
It's the strongest and most stable connection

39:16.320 --> 39:17.720
that we can form with another person.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.920
And that matters immensely.

39:19.920 --> 39:24.440
It matters for the human family to have evolved

39:24.440 --> 39:27.240
to be something that could survive against the odds

39:27.240 --> 39:29.880
that we've faced over the years.

39:29.880 --> 39:34.880
That unreasonable bond that becomes reasonable

39:35.560 --> 39:37.760
by virtue of its own existence.

39:38.600 --> 39:43.600
And of course, that joy, the wild,

39:43.920 --> 39:46.640
raw joy of love is not a bad thing either.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.560
So you put these together, the strongest bridge we can form

39:51.560 --> 39:54.360
and the reward and the joy that it brings.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.800
That's what love is to me.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.360
And from my perspective, this is something that,

40:01.520 --> 40:05.040
you know, it can be hard to capture fairly

40:05.040 --> 40:07.240
because you wanna talk about the positive

40:07.240 --> 40:09.080
and the negative sides at once.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.360
They need to be wrapped up together

40:10.360 --> 40:13.680
for a full honest description of what it is.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.640
And that's hard to do in a compact form.

40:16.640 --> 40:19.360
And so you have to take time to talk about love.

40:19.360 --> 40:23.600
You have to take time to do it justice.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.560
It takes a book or at least a poem.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.440
Or several thousands of them.

40:28.440 --> 40:30.640
I don't know, could you pull up,

40:30.680 --> 40:34.000
there's a video I saw, yeah, like right here.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.560
So can you pause for a second?

40:37.400 --> 40:39.240
So there's more to the penguins.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.000
So you always see like penguins huddling together

40:43.160 --> 40:45.920
against, I mean, sorry if I see just metaphors

40:45.920 --> 40:48.640
and everything, but them huddling together

40:48.640 --> 40:52.200
against the harshness of the conditions around them.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.720
That's very kind of, that's like a metaphor for life.

40:55.720 --> 40:59.280
Like finding this connection, that's kind of what love is.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.160
It's like allows you to forget whatever the absurdity,

41:02.160 --> 41:04.320
whatever the suffering of life is together,

41:04.320 --> 41:06.760
you get to like huddle for warmth.

41:06.760 --> 41:11.520
And that's why I love the sort of just the honesty

41:11.520 --> 41:13.160
and the intensity of the way penguins

41:13.160 --> 41:15.240
just in the middle of like the cold do this.

41:15.240 --> 41:19.160
And then this video I saw a lonely,

41:19.160 --> 41:20.960
this is misinformation.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.960
So the name of the video is Lonely Deranged Penguin.

41:23.960 --> 41:26.080
I don't know if he's deranged.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.320
So if you play it, so he left his pack

41:32.280 --> 41:34.560
and there's a nice like voiceover

41:34.560 --> 41:36.080
and you don't need to play it,

41:36.080 --> 41:38.960
but he for some reason left the pack

41:38.960 --> 41:41.800
and journeyed out into the mountains.

41:41.800 --> 41:44.760
And so the narrator says that he's deranged,

41:44.760 --> 41:46.520
he's lost his mind.

41:46.520 --> 41:50.720
Now I'd like to project the idea that he's actually,

41:50.720 --> 41:52.960
there's so many stories you could think of.

41:52.960 --> 41:55.160
He's returning to his homeland.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.760
He's an outsider thinking,

41:56.760 --> 41:58.400
journeying out into the unknown,

41:58.400 --> 42:00.200
thinking he may be able to discover

42:00.200 --> 42:02.120
something greater than the tribe.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.680
He might be looking for a lost love.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.680
Why is he deranged immediately?

42:06.680 --> 42:08.040
Why has he lost his mind?

42:08.040 --> 42:11.000
Anyway, but people should look up this video

42:11.000 --> 42:12.960
because to me, I might be the only one

42:12.960 --> 42:15.360
who romanticizes this,

42:15.360 --> 42:18.800
but it's such a nice kind of,

42:18.800 --> 42:21.880
it's both a picture of perhaps a mental disorder,

42:21.880 --> 42:23.920
which is what the video kind of describes.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.960
And it may be some deeper explanation

42:25.960 --> 42:30.960
that's not, that has to do with the motivation of a mind.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.520
Yeah, I don't know if you have a deeper analysis

42:35.520 --> 42:36.360
on this penguin.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.160
Well, I, like you,

42:38.160 --> 42:40.120
as a psychiatrist.

42:40.120 --> 42:42.120
I would want to sit down with the penguin

42:42.120 --> 42:45.480
and go through, I want to see the notes

42:45.480 --> 42:47.720
from his prior therapist.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.680
But this actually is relevant,

42:51.680 --> 42:54.680
not knowing what was that penguin's motivation.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.760
We have very clear situations

42:57.760 --> 42:59.640
where there are both within an individual

42:59.640 --> 43:00.840
we go through periods of time

43:00.840 --> 43:03.760
when we stay in one place

43:03.760 --> 43:06.600
and we reap the benefits from what we've built.

43:06.600 --> 43:09.200
And then we go through periods of foraging,

43:09.200 --> 43:11.320
of wandering.

43:11.320 --> 43:15.520
Even if there may be resources where we are,

43:15.520 --> 43:18.280
we have periods of time in our lives where we wander,

43:18.800 --> 43:22.680
where we go in an exploratory mode.

43:22.680 --> 43:26.520
And different people express that trait in different ways.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.840
This is not a human specific trait.

43:27.840 --> 43:31.560
If you go down to the tiny little nematode worm,

43:31.560 --> 43:34.720
C. elegans with 302 nervous system cells,

43:34.720 --> 43:37.200
they go through these phases of foraging and rest.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.560
And different individuals have different propensity

43:39.560 --> 43:42.880
to forage or to rest and stay in one place.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.520
At the level of the species, that's really good

43:45.560 --> 43:50.560
that there's that diversity in their willingness to forage.

43:51.080 --> 43:53.000
Some stay where they are.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.680
The species is somewhat on a firm footing then,

43:56.680 --> 44:00.360
but some carry a burden, a risk for themselves,

44:00.360 --> 44:03.360
but it's good for the species that they're explorers

44:03.360 --> 44:05.480
and they will venture out.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.480
The migration patterns that different species

44:08.480 --> 44:10.760
blunder into and that turn out to be really good,

44:10.760 --> 44:13.320
they weren't logically derived.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.240
They most certainly started from something like this,

44:17.240 --> 44:18.080
an exploration.

44:18.080 --> 44:19.360
And humans do this too, you think?

44:19.360 --> 44:20.440
And we do it too.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.880
In fact, it's something we do extremely well.

44:23.880 --> 44:25.920
Let's talk about psychiatry a little bit.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.920
So in my book, you're a rock star.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.080
First of all, for people who don't know,

44:33.080 --> 44:38.080
aside from sort of the neurological view of the brain

44:38.320 --> 44:40.200
and neuroscience view of the brain,

44:40.200 --> 44:43.200
you're also one of the great psychiatrists of our time.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.760
Not always, but when I was younger,

44:45.760 --> 44:47.680
I dreamed about being a psychiatrist.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.360
So it's like getting to meet your heroes

44:53.360 --> 44:58.360
and also getting to meet the people who the best,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.560
at the top of the world at the thing you've failed to pursue.

45:03.560 --> 45:07.240
So I'm getting a free therapy session on top of that.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.480
Okay, so what big picture, what is the practice,

45:11.480 --> 45:13.880
the goal, the hope of modern psychiatry?

45:13.880 --> 45:18.800
If you could try to describe the discipline as you see it,

45:18.800 --> 45:23.080
maybe historically throughout the 20th century

45:23.080 --> 45:25.520
in contrasting to what it is today.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.440
Or maybe if you want to describe to what you hope

45:28.440 --> 45:32.720
psychiatry becomes or longs to become in the 21st century.

45:32.720 --> 45:36.320
Yeah, it's been an interesting journey.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.360
Psychiatry started out pretty firmly grounded

45:39.360 --> 45:40.960
in neurology and pathology.

45:40.960 --> 45:44.280
Some of the initial founders effectively of the field

45:44.280 --> 45:47.000
were very well grounded in microscopy,

45:47.000 --> 45:51.240
looking at cells, working with patients,

45:51.240 --> 45:52.520
particularly on the neurological side.

45:52.520 --> 45:54.280
And this certainly included Freud

45:54.280 --> 45:55.840
and some of his contemporaries.

45:58.360 --> 46:03.120
But they rapidly discovered that what they could work with

46:03.120 --> 46:07.560
at the level of cells and microscopy was so far

46:07.600 --> 46:11.600
from the realm of what they could get from a human being.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.160
And what they were getting from the human being

46:13.160 --> 46:16.440
was so much more interesting and was so mysterious

46:16.440 --> 46:18.880
and so unknown that many of them just said,

46:18.880 --> 46:20.240
we're gonna inhabit this domain

46:20.240 --> 46:23.240
and we're gonna work with the people with their words

46:23.240 --> 46:27.080
and understand what we can based on verbal communication

46:27.080 --> 46:30.560
because that was the only tool that people really had.

46:30.560 --> 46:35.560
And that was a very important step for the field.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.760
I would say one of the interesting things

46:37.760 --> 46:41.280
that came from the early decades of psychiatry

46:41.280 --> 46:44.080
really was this distinction between the conscious

46:44.080 --> 46:48.520
and the unconscious mind and paying particular attention

46:48.520 --> 46:50.280
to the unconscious mind as something

46:50.280 --> 46:52.480
that was worthy of consideration,

46:52.480 --> 46:57.000
that might be important in explaining people's actions

46:57.000 --> 46:59.040
and that perhaps even insight into that

46:59.040 --> 47:01.040
was valuable in its own right.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.680
And out of that psychoanalysis,

47:03.800 --> 47:07.600
psychoanalysis became a practice

47:07.600 --> 47:12.600
that was not always focused on cures or treatment

47:12.840 --> 47:14.240
but was more focused on insight.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.400
What does it mean?

47:15.400 --> 47:17.360
How can we help people understand

47:17.360 --> 47:19.920
why they're feeling something or thinking something

47:19.920 --> 47:21.200
or dreaming something?

47:22.280 --> 47:24.720
And that insight separate even from treatment

47:24.720 --> 47:26.560
was an interesting thing.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.280
As long as one was honest about that and said,

47:29.280 --> 47:31.160
you know, we're going for understanding,

47:31.160 --> 47:32.400
we're going for insight.

47:32.440 --> 47:34.880
Maybe it's useful to just pause on that.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.840
If you look at the father of psychoanalysis,

47:37.840 --> 47:42.840
Sigmund Freud, what do you make of the ideas that he had?

47:43.360 --> 47:46.880
So you mentioned taking the unconscious,

47:46.880 --> 47:49.400
the subconscious seriously.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.240
That's like step one, like that there could be worlds

47:52.240 --> 47:53.920
we do not have direct access for

47:53.920 --> 47:57.840
and we probe at them through conversation

47:57.840 --> 48:00.920
or is that too simplistic

48:00.920 --> 48:03.160
to call psychoanalysis conversation?

48:03.160 --> 48:05.240
That's not too simplistic, but that's right.

48:05.240 --> 48:06.680
And I think that was valuable.

48:06.680 --> 48:09.080
Where Freud ended up breaking

48:09.080 --> 48:10.320
from some of his contemporaries,

48:10.320 --> 48:13.320
he was very focused on this unconscious

48:13.320 --> 48:15.760
as being so tightly linked to libido.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.920
And really from his perspective,

48:18.920 --> 48:20.880
you couldn't really separate the operation

48:20.880 --> 48:23.040
of the unconscious mind from these aspects,

48:23.040 --> 48:24.200
the libidinous aspects.

48:24.200 --> 48:29.200
And that was one reason, sexual related drives.

48:29.200 --> 48:33.160
Carl Jung, who was his contemporary,

48:33.160 --> 48:37.200
that's one factor that led to them separating was,

48:37.200 --> 48:40.480
Carl Jung felt there was a lot more to the unconscious

48:40.480 --> 48:42.720
than this libidinous aspect of it.

48:42.720 --> 48:45.880
And he saw it as a much more complete

48:47.520 --> 48:50.960
alternate representation of the conscious self,

48:50.960 --> 48:53.520
one that maybe reflected a whole range

48:53.520 --> 48:58.400
of different motivations and desires.

49:00.040 --> 49:04.800
And to properly treat it, one had to consider all of them

49:04.800 --> 49:06.600
rather than the ones that Freud was hooked on.

49:06.600 --> 49:11.600
Carl Jung, thank you for the high level of images

49:13.360 --> 49:15.520
that Sergei is pulling up for people who are just listening.

49:15.520 --> 49:19.480
He pulled up a, as a quote from Sigmund Freud,

49:19.480 --> 49:22.560
it's a meme, your mom quote, Freud.

49:23.440 --> 49:26.760
So the shadow, the Carl Jung shadow

49:26.800 --> 49:28.800
encompasses everything,

49:28.800 --> 49:31.280
not just the desire to have sex with your mother

49:31.280 --> 49:32.640
or sex period.

49:32.640 --> 49:34.360
That's right, that's right.

49:34.360 --> 49:38.160
If you look at those two folks en masse,

49:38.160 --> 49:40.040
I mean, there's a kind of,

49:40.040 --> 49:44.200
it's almost like a technique for philosophical exploration

49:44.200 --> 49:47.360
of human mind, human motivations.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.040
So it's not even like necessarily,

49:50.040 --> 49:53.760
it's also doubles as a methodology for helping people,

49:53.760 --> 49:55.000
but it's almost like a,

49:56.480 --> 49:59.960
it's a kind of philosophical method.

49:59.960 --> 50:01.120
Right.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.760
This is the fascinating thing about psychoanalysis

50:03.760 --> 50:06.920
and even though it's, I would say,

50:06.920 --> 50:10.400
mostly not considered a treatment today,

50:10.400 --> 50:11.800
it persists for a couple of reasons.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.880
One is it's thought that it gives people some insight,

50:15.880 --> 50:19.960
but second, there's been a huge influence on literature,

50:19.960 --> 50:22.080
on philosophy, on art,

50:22.080 --> 50:24.520
and the opening up of discussion

50:24.520 --> 50:27.600
about what was below our conscious mind

50:27.600 --> 50:31.720
was so fertile in the implications

50:31.720 --> 50:34.720
that it sort of reverberated and still does

50:34.720 --> 50:37.120
throughout all these different realms of human endeavor

50:37.120 --> 50:42.120
from different artistic experiences that people have

50:45.040 --> 50:50.040
can be colored by this concept of the unconscious.

50:50.040 --> 50:51.760
Now, the other thing that was interesting

50:51.760 --> 50:54.120
is this distinction,

50:55.880 --> 50:57.760
what are the parts of the unconscious?

50:57.760 --> 51:00.680
And so there were these id and ego

51:00.680 --> 51:04.040
and superego subdivisions that,

51:06.560 --> 51:08.920
that Freud, for example, would talk about them

51:08.920 --> 51:11.760
and the id was the primary,

51:11.760 --> 51:14.960
the primal drives that an infant would have

51:14.960 --> 51:18.200
or that a very young child just warmth and feeding

51:18.200 --> 51:22.560
and then later the sexual or libidinous aspects.

51:22.560 --> 51:25.240
And for Freud, the later happened very quickly.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.440
That's the controversial thing about him, I think.

51:29.440 --> 51:32.560
I guess he thought like even children had sexual desires

51:32.560 --> 51:35.160
that they're like dealing with, contending with.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.960
So it's the full thing, hungry, wanting to eat,

51:37.960 --> 51:39.960
wanting to poop, wanting to have sex.

51:39.960 --> 51:43.720
Yeah, and he was extremely focused on that aspect.

51:43.720 --> 51:46.320
But then there was the superego,

51:46.320 --> 51:49.120
which brought on these later sort of moralistic

51:51.120 --> 51:52.840
sort of codes of conduct.

51:52.840 --> 51:56.240
And that of course was very often in tension,

51:56.240 --> 51:58.600
but all this could play out subconsciously.

51:58.600 --> 52:01.840
And then the ego, this third aspect was mediating

52:01.840 --> 52:04.720
and Freud's conception mediated this tension

52:04.720 --> 52:06.360
between the different parts.

52:07.320 --> 52:09.520
Now, I think that's interesting.

52:09.520 --> 52:14.520
I will say that in some ways it's maybe unnecessary

52:15.280 --> 52:17.080
from the perspective of modern neuroscience

52:17.080 --> 52:22.080
to divide things up that way from the moralistic drives

52:23.920 --> 52:28.120
and the primal gratification drives.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.000
In some ways they're all drives

52:30.000 --> 52:32.840
and maybe they're even all primal drives.

52:32.840 --> 52:35.280
The moralistic drives, they're taught

52:35.280 --> 52:37.880
and they're taught in ways that ultimately relate

52:37.880 --> 52:39.280
back to survival.

52:39.280 --> 52:43.520
And you could even say selfish aspects

52:43.760 --> 52:47.520
of health and life for the self and family.

52:47.520 --> 52:52.520
And so this is, I think it's maybe an artificial distinction.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.240
The concept of the unconscious is very valuable

52:56.240 --> 52:57.640
and very interesting.

52:57.640 --> 53:02.640
But these categorizations of id and superego

53:03.280 --> 53:07.480
may not map onto neurobiology in any particular way.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.520
There's a town hall of competing drives and desires

53:10.520 --> 53:13.720
and they interrelate to each other.

53:13.720 --> 53:16.040
They involve different aspects of the brain

53:16.040 --> 53:18.760
and the history of the person.

53:18.760 --> 53:22.120
And actions and choices come out of the result

53:22.120 --> 53:25.440
of that overall shouting in the town hall.

53:25.440 --> 53:27.920
So in some sense Carl Jung was a step into the direction

53:27.920 --> 53:32.280
of liberating yourself from such harsh categorizations.

53:32.280 --> 53:35.240
Do you think, I mean, you have Daniel Kahneman

53:35.240 --> 53:37.400
with system one and system two.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.480
There's just these very compelling categorizations

53:41.480 --> 53:44.560
of the human mind that seem to be sticky

53:44.560 --> 53:48.240
in our, in the superego.

53:48.240 --> 53:52.720
No, in the how we talk about these ideas and so on.

53:52.720 --> 53:55.520
Do you think those are helpful or do they get in the way?

53:55.520 --> 53:57.920
Is it some kind of balance in terms of deeper understanding

53:57.920 --> 53:59.400
of how the mind actually works?

53:59.400 --> 54:01.720
You know, it's from modern neuroscience,

54:02.920 --> 54:07.920
whenever we seem to get closer to addressing a question

54:08.200 --> 54:10.040
like this at the level of cells,

54:10.880 --> 54:12.320
it seems to get farther away.

54:12.320 --> 54:14.800
And I'll give you an example of what I mean by that.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.800
So one thing I'm doing in my laboratory

54:16.800 --> 54:20.760
and many people are doing is we are listening in

54:20.760 --> 54:24.440
on the activity of cells, neurons in the brain

54:24.440 --> 54:27.720
of mice or rats or fish or monkeys.

54:27.720 --> 54:28.560
Individual cells.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.960
Individual cells, exactly.

54:29.960 --> 54:33.280
Of which there are, you know, in our brain, many billions.

54:33.280 --> 54:37.320
And when we do and we try to predict

54:37.320 --> 54:39.360
what action will be taken by an animal

54:40.560 --> 54:43.680
to address this question, where does the choice arise?

54:43.680 --> 54:47.120
Where does the impetus to make a particular selection

54:47.120 --> 54:48.800
of one action versus another action?

54:48.800 --> 54:50.080
Where does that start in the brain?

54:50.080 --> 54:53.000
If you're recording, listening in on the activity of cells

54:53.000 --> 54:56.680
all across the brain, where's the earliest spot

54:56.680 --> 55:00.640
you can pick up a choice being made?

55:00.640 --> 55:01.480
Well.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.320
That's so awesome.

55:02.320 --> 55:05.680
Yeah, at one level you might think how excited

55:05.920 --> 55:08.160
would Jung have been to see this or Freud

55:08.160 --> 55:11.640
or the early psychoanalyst to see where this starts.

55:12.520 --> 55:15.840
But it's not so simple because an emerging theme

55:15.840 --> 55:17.440
in very recent neuroscience literally

55:17.440 --> 55:22.400
over the last few years is that things sort of all

55:22.400 --> 55:24.400
start together all across the brain.

55:24.400 --> 55:27.080
And so you can be recording from the cortex,

55:27.080 --> 55:29.880
this rim of cells at the surface of the brain

55:29.880 --> 55:32.360
or you can be recording deeper in a structure

55:32.360 --> 55:34.920
called the striatum, which is a little older.

55:34.960 --> 55:38.400
It's more tightly linked to action.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.320
And then structures called the thalamus,

55:40.320 --> 55:41.720
other parts of the brain.

55:41.720 --> 55:43.080
And if you record from these,

55:43.080 --> 55:48.080
these all sort of represent the action and the choice,

55:48.880 --> 55:51.320
more or less all at about the same time, very close.

55:51.320 --> 55:54.240
And so you can't point to a particular spot

55:55.720 --> 55:59.200
and say, here's where the choice or the action originates.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.680
It's a group.

56:00.680 --> 56:02.680
Finding the free will neuron.

56:03.640 --> 56:05.160
It's relevant to that question.

56:05.160 --> 56:08.160
Nobody is close to being able to point to such a thing.

56:08.160 --> 56:11.880
Well, close is a relative term.

56:11.880 --> 56:16.200
And nobody, what I tweet today,

56:16.200 --> 56:17.920
all generalizations are wrong.

56:19.880 --> 56:22.280
So including this one, let's actually talk about that.

56:22.280 --> 56:25.360
So the study of individual cells,

56:25.360 --> 56:29.280
if you could linger on your sense that as you get closer

56:29.280 --> 56:30.520
to that understanding,

56:30.520 --> 56:33.120
it feels like you're getting farther away.

56:33.120 --> 56:34.080
Why is that?

56:34.080 --> 56:36.040
Because that often is the feeling

56:36.040 --> 56:37.600
until you're actually there.

56:38.480 --> 56:42.920
So like, you know, that's when I'm running

56:42.920 --> 56:45.000
and I know there's only a mile left,

56:45.000 --> 56:48.480
it just feels like that mile is just getting longer

56:48.480 --> 56:50.160
and longer, but eventually you finish.

56:50.160 --> 56:52.800
So maybe we're getting close to cracking open

56:52.800 --> 56:54.520
these like beginnings of a sense,

56:54.520 --> 56:56.200
like we'll talk about consciousness

56:56.200 --> 56:59.560
or these very difficult, big questions

56:59.560 --> 57:00.880
about the human mind.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.360
Where do they start?

57:02.360 --> 57:04.680
You're right to say we shouldn't generalize

57:04.680 --> 57:06.400
or make absolutist statements,

57:06.400 --> 57:09.960
but I would say right now the reason things

57:09.960 --> 57:12.880
are looking even harder to crack

57:12.880 --> 57:14.720
than we had initially thought.

57:14.720 --> 57:18.200
We now have the data streams that we've wanted for so long

57:19.240 --> 57:22.240
in terms of activity patterns all across the brain

57:22.240 --> 57:23.240
at the level of cells.

57:23.240 --> 57:26.680
We can literally see what cells are doing.

57:26.680 --> 57:29.120
Immense data sets, you know, we get,

57:29.640 --> 57:32.080
these are time series of one individual cell

57:32.080 --> 57:34.920
with sub-second resolution and you can collect this

57:34.920 --> 57:38.080
from enormous numbers of cells across the brain.

57:38.080 --> 57:40.880
So very rich data sets that we've wanted for a long time

57:40.880 --> 57:45.880
and yet having these has not led to an understanding

57:46.160 --> 57:49.560
of truly where actions initiate

57:49.560 --> 57:51.960
in terms of regions or locations.

57:51.960 --> 57:54.160
And let's get a few questions on that.

57:54.160 --> 57:59.000
Is the answer high-level question by your intuition?

57:59.680 --> 58:01.680
Is the answer within the data?

58:01.680 --> 58:04.640
Or do we need different kind of data?

58:04.640 --> 58:07.920
So we should also say that when you collect data

58:07.920 --> 58:10.680
about the brain, there's like the richness

58:10.680 --> 58:12.600
of information you're collecting,

58:12.600 --> 58:14.760
but there's also human doing stuff.

58:16.880 --> 58:20.280
Like, and the information, so static information

58:20.280 --> 58:23.480
about the human and dynamic information about the human

58:23.480 --> 58:25.320
and you can get them to do different stuff

58:25.320 --> 58:27.440
and you can select different humans

58:27.480 --> 58:30.720
and that's part of the collection of data aspects.

58:30.720 --> 58:33.440
So like when you're collecting data about the brain,

58:33.440 --> 58:36.640
there's some truths that you can, you know,

58:36.640 --> 58:38.240
in machine learning is like annotations,

58:38.240 --> 58:39.720
like supervised learning.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.120
There's some true things you can hold onto

58:42.120 --> 58:46.080
before you look at the full rich mess complexity

58:46.080 --> 58:47.640
of the human mind.

58:47.640 --> 58:50.120
So given the data you've looked at,

58:50.120 --> 58:54.080
do you think the answer for the origin of free will

58:54.080 --> 58:56.680
in the human mind can be found?

58:58.120 --> 59:03.120
Well, one amazing thing is that nobody's found it,

59:04.320 --> 59:05.840
but we have these rich data sets

59:05.840 --> 59:08.880
and then there's a conundrum, which is,

59:09.800 --> 59:10.800
is it in the data?

59:10.800 --> 59:12.080
And we just don't know how to look at it.

59:12.080 --> 59:13.760
Maybe we don't know the right scale,

59:13.760 --> 59:15.800
the right projection to make of the data,

59:15.800 --> 59:17.760
the right way to interpret it.

59:17.760 --> 59:21.280
And here's where causal testing becomes very valuable

59:21.280 --> 59:23.840
because then instead of just passively observing,

59:24.840 --> 59:28.400
well, here are the activity patterns

59:28.400 --> 59:30.640
and then here's the choice made by the animal

59:32.280 --> 59:36.080
as we've gotten more powerful at reaching in

59:36.080 --> 59:38.040
and causing things to happen in the brain,

59:38.040 --> 59:42.200
turning up or down the activity of certain types of cells

59:42.200 --> 59:44.480
or defined populations of cells

59:44.480 --> 59:46.440
and seeing how that affects actions.

59:46.440 --> 59:48.960
These causal perturbations have turned out

59:48.960 --> 59:50.520
to be very valuable.

59:50.520 --> 59:52.280
We're just now getting to the point

59:52.280 --> 59:57.280
where we can apply these in very wide swaths of the brain

59:58.480 --> 59:59.640
at cellular resolution.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:02.640
And so we're gonna be able hopefully to make some headway

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.040
on this question with causality.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:08.760
And that's the one thing that optogenetics provides us

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.200
this way of using light that we develop to control cells.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.200
This is relatively untapped at this broad brain-wide scale

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.920
and hopefully we can get there in the near future.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.680
But I would say that the answer may be in the data,

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.400
but we don't know how to find it.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.040
Well, there's this interactive element

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.720
like where you can cause stuff that's really powerful

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.600
because you get to, I mean,

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.520
as opposed to collecting data passively,

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.280
you're collecting data actively.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.440
So can you maybe describe

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.680
one of the many things you're known for?

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.360
One of the big things is called optogenetics.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.600
What is it?

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.200
Optogenetics is a way of causing things to happen.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.240
It's a way of determining what actually matters

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.200
in terms of the activity of the brain

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.200
for the amazing things it does, sensation, cognition, action.

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.680
And what it does is it provides activity.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.280
It's a way of playing in, if you will,

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.520
activity patterns into precisely defined cells.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.760
And the way we do it is pretty cool, I think.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.240
Right away, there's a problem.

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.360
If you think about how do we do this,

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.400
how could we play in well-defined activity patterns

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:20.120
and provide a stream of activity into this cell

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.720
and that cell and that cell, but not these other cells?

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.480
But just for context,

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.440
we're talking about the brains of mice, monkeys, humans,

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.920
and then the goal is to try to control accurately

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.320
the behavior of a single neuron

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.680
and then to be able to monitor

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.000
a single collection of single neurons to then say,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
well, to draw some deeper insight about the origins,

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.320
first of all, the function of different parts of the brain,

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:55.000
different neurons, different kinds of neurons,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.440
but also the origins of the big things,

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.440
the flap of the butterfly wing

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.520
that leads to an actual behavioral thing.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.040
Yeah, so if you could, exactly.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.360
So if you could turn on or off the brain

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.600
or parts of the brain or cell types

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:15.600
or individual cells at the natural rate and rhythm

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.880
and timing of normal brain activity,

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.840
that would be immensely valuable

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.480
because you could determine what actually mattered,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.880
what could cause complex things to happen

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.440
and what could prevent complex things

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.720
from happening in a specific way.

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.880
But right away, you've got a problem if you wanna do this

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.240
and neuroscientists have wanted to do this for a long time.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:37.240
Francis Crick of Double Helix of DNA fame,

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.560
he wrote a famous paper in 1999.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.080
He got interested in neuroscience later in life.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.720
And he said, what we need in neuroscience

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.800
is a way that we could turn on or off

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:52.640
the activity of individual types of neurons

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.440
in a behaving animal.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.240
And he even said the ideal signal would be light

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.560
because it would be fast,

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.760
it could penetrate through the brain to some extent.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.840
And he had no idea how to do it.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.680
He said this would probably be very far-fetched,

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.520
but it would be a good thing.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.160
And so that's what you're actually saying.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.320
Like if you wanna do this kind of thing

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.840
and imagine like, how do I get inside the brain?

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:24.600
It's pretty difficult.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.440
It's pretty difficult.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.680
And then even once you get in,

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.200
it's hard because all brain cells are electrical.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.480
All neurons are electrically activated.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.760
And so if you wanted to use electricity

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.320
as what you were putting in,

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.480
you won't have any specificity at all.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.360
If you have an electrode, a wire,

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:42.400
and you put it in the brain

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.360
and you send current through it,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.280
all the cells near the electrode will be stimulated.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.160
That's like trying to control fish

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.680
by spraying them with water.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.000
Yeah, right.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.280
Because there's already a lot of electricity

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.240
going around anyway, and you're adding more.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:00.800
But there's no specificity,

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.600
even among the different kinds of cells either,

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.080
because all around the wire that you've put in,

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.840
there are gonna be so many different cells

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.560
doing totally different things,

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:10.560
many of them in opposition to each other.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.280
We know that's one way the brain is set up.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.280
There are parts of the brain that

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.040
where neurons side by side

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.400
are doing completely different things

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.280
and maybe even antagonistic to each other.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.120
So what do you do?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.720
How do you play in activity with any kind of specificity?

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.080
Well, what we found is what you can do

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.080
is make some cells responsive to light.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.720
Now, normally no cells deep in the brain

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.640
really respond to light.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.120
They're not built for that.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.360
There's no reason for them to respond to light in there,

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.240
which is a great situation to start with,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.960
because any light sensitivity you can provide to some cells

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.560
will be a huge signal above the noise.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.520
And so that's what we do with optogenetics.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.560
We take genes, bits of DNA

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.800
from microbes, single-celled organisms.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.080
And these single-celled organisms like algae,

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.360
they make little proteins

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.960
that sit in the surface of their cells

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.240
that receive light, capture a photon of light

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.400
and open up a little hole in the membrane of the cell

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.840
and let charged particles, ions like sodium and potassium

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.440
flow across the membrane of the cell.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.440
And these algae and bacteria,

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.760
they do this for their own reasons

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.280
because that helps them move.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.880
It helps them make and use energy.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.560
But that's a beautiful thing for neuroscience

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:39.160
because movement of ions, charged particles

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.680
across the membrane of the cell

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:43.960
is exactly the kind of electricity that neurons work with.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.240
So if we can take this bit of DNA

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.760
that encodes this beautiful protein

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.440
that turns light into electricity from algae,

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.600
and if we can put it into some neurons

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:58.200
but not other neurons, which we can do using genetic tricks,

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.240
then you've got a situation, then you can shine on the light

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.920
and only the cells that have the gene

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.760
and that are expressing the gene

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.160
will be the initial direct cells

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.160
that are activated by the light.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.880
And so that's the essence of optogenetics

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.600
is the ability to do that.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.080
We get that initial specificity

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.840
that you could never get with an electrode.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.240
First of all, let me say that this is,

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.560
we recently got the Alaska Prize for this.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.240
It's a brilliant idea.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.880
So I talked to Andrew Huberman,

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.080
who's a friend of yours, a friend of mine,

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.480
not to jinx things, but he believes

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.720
that he deserves the Nobel Prize for this.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:41.720
So I do too, but what, my votes.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.680
Anyway, the thing is, it doesn't matter.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.280
Prizes will be all forgotten.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.480
All of us will be forgotten.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.920
When the cool idea is a cool idea,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.640
that's a really powerful idea.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.800
It's actually the origins of it

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.640
you might be interested in are even are very deep.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.880
There was a botanist in St. Petersburg

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.600
named Andre Fomenson.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:05.640
In 1866, he published a paper

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.880
on the single celled green algae.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.000
And he was the botanist who first noticed

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.120
that they moved in response to light.

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.560
These are tiny single celled algae that have flagella,

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.480
so they swim through the water.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.120
And he noticed this, he was a botanist,

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.560
and he published this.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.160
It was a paper, he wrote in German,

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.760
but he published it in a French journal,

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.680
and he was doing it from St. Petersburg,

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.440
so it was a very international effort.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:34.160
But you have to go back to 1866,

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.120
and that, I like to highlight how far back

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.880
that discovery goes is back to Andre Fomenson.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.040
And this is a, it highlights the value

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.760
of just pure basic science discovery.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.400
That always originates somewhere

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.560
in the Eastern European block.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.640
But I don't think he expected the splicing

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:57.960
of genetic material from the algae into the human brain.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.480
And one of the cool things we've been able to do now

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.080
with modern methods is to really study these proteins.

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.320
And so we've discovered some of these proteins,

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.520
other groups have as well.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.680
We've dived deep into their structure,

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.960
just like the double helix structure of DNA

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.600
was uncovered with X-ray crystallography.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.880
We used the same method, X-ray crystallography,

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:18.080
to see how these beautiful little proteins work.

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.080
We've re-engineered them for all kinds of function.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.360
We can make them, instead of responding to blue light,

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.520
we can make them respond to red light.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.400
We can speed them up, slow them down.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.920
We can make them, with genetic engineering,

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.320
we can make them have different ions flow through them.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.720
And so it's this convergence, as you said,

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:36.280
like the botanist in 1866

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.440
couldn't have predicted what we could do with this.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.680
And the fact that we've been able to discover

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.240
how these beautiful proteins work,

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.040
and then apply them to neuroscience

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.320
is really a thrilling story.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.480
Is it possible to achieve scale, do you think, with this?

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.760
Meaning, what is the progress of the next 50 years,

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.840
100 years looks like in terms of the precision

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.120
and the scale of control of using light?

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:02.320
It's going so fast, it's hard to predict.

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.960
I'll give you a sense of it, though.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:11.120
First paper we published in 2005,

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.440
that was just encultured neurons.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:14.560
By 2007, so that was in a dish.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.560
By 2007, we had it working in behaving mice.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.840
By 2009, we had it pretty general.

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:23.360
So we had methods to really make it a versatile method.

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.280
It could be applied to essentially any cell.

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.280
By 2012, we could get to single cell resolution.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.120
We used light guidance strategies

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.120
to target individual cells in the brain of a living mouse.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:41.560
By 2019, we were able to control up to 20 to 50

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.840
individually specified single cells

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:47.160
in the brain of a mouse in ways

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.240
that specifically changed its behavior,

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.640
that could bias its decisions one way or the other.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.440
In fact, we could take a mouse

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:59.000
and without any visual stimulus at all,

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.760
we could make it act as if it had seen

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.440
a particular visual stimulus

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:07.600
by playing in using the single cell resolution optogenetics,

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.040
a specific pattern of activity

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.920
into 20 or 25 individually specified cells.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.520
That's 2019.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.680
To your question of scale, now in 2022,

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.200
we're controlling hundreds

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.840
of individually specified single cells

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.880
over all of visual cortex of a mouse,

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.000
all the part of the brain

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.840
that is the initial direct target

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:31.160
of the incoming information from the retina.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.320
Are you constrained to specific types of cells currently?

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.800
Like you mentioned, long range is a little easier.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.720
Is there constraints on which cells?

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.040
Now there really isn't.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.600
Now that we have this individual cell guidance,

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.440
we can target any individual kind of cell very reliably.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.080
And so now to your question of scale,

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.520
how far can we go?

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.680
Well, things are moving quickly.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.080
It's hard to say.

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:03.680
We can access individual cells across the entire brain now.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.800
If you look 10, 20 years in the future,

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.880
I think we'll surprise ourselves,

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.560
but the fact that we're already able

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.200
to cause specific perceptions to happen

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.760
and specific actions means we're essentially

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.600
where we wanna be.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.600
And now it's a matter of just more experiments,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:26.840
more discoveries,

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.960
but the basic principles are clear now.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.240
The basic capability is there.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:36.360
Is there a pathway to doing the same for humans?

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.440
Optogenetics is primarily, it's a discovery tool

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.800
that really is well-suited for use in mice and rats

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:46.800
and monkeys because it involves putting in a gene

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.760
and also delivering light.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.640
And those are two things that you can do in human beings,

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.760
but you'd wanna do in a very careful way.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.280
Now that said, there is actually just less than a year ago,

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.320
my friend Botan Roska in Switzerland,

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.840
he did the first human optogenetics therapy.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.040
And he published this in the journal Nature Medicine.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.440
So about 10, 12 years ago,

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.920
he and I published a paper together

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920
where we gave him one of our optogenetic tools,

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:25.080
one of these light-activated regulators of ion flow.

01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.000
These are called microbial opsins, by the way, opsins.

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.160
And he put one of those into an extracted retina

01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.760
from a human being who had died.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.840
So it was a cadaveric retina.

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:41.600
And he was able to show that optical control in this paper

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:45.400
was able to turn on or off individual cells

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.440
in the human retina.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.480
So that was a while back.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.760
He spent about 10 years of going through

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:54.520
all the regulatory, you know, hoops and hurdles

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:56.440
and going through primate studies.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:00.560
And finally, he was able to take a human being

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.920
with a retinal degeneration syndrome.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.240
So someone who was blind in both eyes.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.440
And he gave one of these opsins into one eye

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.040
of this human being who was blind

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:18.480
and with the goal of conferring light sensitivity

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.480
onto this retina that was not able to see light.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480
And he was able to make this person see through that eye.

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.000
So he took a blind person and the blind person could see,

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.520
now could reach for objects selectively on a table.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.440
And he published this in Nature Medicine.

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:39.680
And it was, you know, that's an amazing thing.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.560
Do you know the title of the paper?

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560
What's his name again?

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.920
Roska, R-O-S-K-A.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.480
Can you look up the Nature paper?

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.840
Yeah, Nature Medicine.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.760
Nature Medicine.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.440
So that's sort of proof of principle.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.240
Now the retina is very accessible.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.720
It's near the surface.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.160
You can use natural light

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.120
or you can use brighter natural light.

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:02.040
I'm myself, I see optogenetics as a discovery tool.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.440
It's a way to figure out the principles

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.840
by which the brain works and how it operates.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.640
Partial recovery of visual function

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.240
in a blind patient after optogenetic therapy.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:14.000
So he went through the full process of doing primates,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.280
that is, and then going, wow, that's dedication.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.120
And that's really exciting to see.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.320
Yeah.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.720
As beautiful as that is,

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:24.000
and I'm glad he did all that work,

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.360
there are so many other ways

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.600
that optogenetics could help with therapies.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.440
Once you know the principles,

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.960
then any kind of therapy can become more powerful.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.800
Once you know the causal cells in a symptom,

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:41.320
like in lack of motivation or inability to enjoy things

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:44.040
or altered sleep or altered energy,

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.160
once you know the cells that are causal,

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.680
then you can make medications that address those cells.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.280
You could address brain stimulation treatments

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:53.480
that might address those cells.

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.680
Also diagnosis,

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.760
you need to be a very effective systematic way

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.440
of diagnosing or at least providing you rich data

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:04.800
to some of these deep questions about schizophrenia,

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.840
about bipolar, all of those kinds of things that are,

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.760
the tools are low resolution currently

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.360
for determining the degree to which you have a thing

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:18.040
and whether you have a thing at all.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:18.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.440
And so the hope is,

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:25.600
this is a great example of how you can cure

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.360
or you can provide some relief

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.840
for a symptom of a person

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.360
who has a serious degenerative disease.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.240
But the principles are what we're after.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.520
And that's why I spend, even though I'm a psychiatrist,

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.160
even though I still see patients,

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.080
I'm not myself trying to drive

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.480
any clinical trials in the lab.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.360
I'm trying to discover,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:50.920
and then any kind of therapy could result from that.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.920
What do you think about my friend Elon Musk

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.360
and his efforts with Neuralink?

01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.640
So this is another,

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.880
there's a lot of things to say here

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.480
because there's a lot of ideas

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.320
under the umbrella of Neuralink.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.680
But one of them is to use electrical signals to stimulate

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.280
and then you also record,

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.840
you collect electrical signals from the brain

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:17.920
at a higher and higher resolution

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.920
and you go implant surgically the methods

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:26.440
by which you do the stimulation and the data collection.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.520
So it's possible for the ideas of optogenetics

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.040
to play well with this.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.680
And we can even zoom out outside of just Neuralink

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.560
and just the whole idea of brain-computer interfaces.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.800
Well, what are your thoughts?

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.640
Well, I think the engineering that they've done

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:44.520
is actually pretty cool.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.160
So I like the-

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.000
Robots.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.520
Yeah, from the design perspective

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:52.240
and it was a design approach

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.600
that wasn't being taken in academia.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.760
And it's great that they did it

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.440
and I think it's pretty cool.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.040
So I'll say that.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.600
Also, there are many ways that you can record

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.880
from many thousands of neurons.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:08.040
That's not the only way, it's a very interesting way.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.440
We and others are using brain penetrating electrodes

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:13.880
that actually get quite deep.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.480
The whole structure of the brain is very interesting.

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.880
There's the surface cortex

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:21.520
where it's the most recently emergent part

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:23.680
of the brain in evolution.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.600
Mammals have it, reptiles have something a little bit

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.920
like it, but it's not really the full thing.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.080
This is a very recent thing.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:33.640
That's what we can access with some of these,

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.120
like the Neuralink approach

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.320
and with some of these short electrodes.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.520
This part of the brain, the cortex,

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.720
is only a few millimeters thick.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.920
There's so much that's deep though that's so important.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.720
There's the striatum, there's the thalamus.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.160
There are the parts of the brain that drive motivation,

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:53.000
that drive hunger and thirst and social interaction

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and parenting and flight and fear and anxiety.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.480
All these things are, there's so much that's deep

01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.840
that these surface approaches are not getting to.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.640
And so we and others are using these very long electrodes

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.840
that help us get deep and we can still record

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.600
for many cells, many thousands of cells.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.360
We can have multiple of these at once in the same animal.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:18.480
And so there's a diversity of methods to get to this goal.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:20.640
I think it's great that people coming

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.640
from the outside academia will bring ideas

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.080
that weren't being worked on, at least approaches.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.200
They may turn out to be synergistic.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.640
These things do work very well with optogenetics

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.440
because all these electrical recording methods,

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:39.680
that's one channel of information flow.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.240
Light delivery is a separate, more or less independent.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.400
There can be some artifacts that happen,

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.240
but if you're careful,

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.880
that's another independent pathway of information flow.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.200
And we've done really fun experiments in mice

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.280
where we play in patterns of activity with light

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.760
and we record activity from all across the brain

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.160
of a mouse electrically.

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.320
And so using optical and electrical together

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.000
is extremely powerful.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.240
So like optoelectric brain computer interfaces,

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.080
which by the way, there's efforts on the computing side

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:16.200
to build optoelectric servers.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.120
So like where you have both electricity,

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.160
because optics is really interesting.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.880
Light is a very interesting method of communication

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:26.240
that's, like you said, orthogonal in many ways.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.920
It doesn't have some of the constraints of bandwidth

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.360
that electricity does going through wires,

01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:34.280
but you're able to,

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.600
but less ability to control precisely at scale.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.640
So like there's challenges and there's benefits

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:42.760
and having those two interplay is really, really,

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.000
really fascinating.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.600
Especially when obviously on the other side

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:51.600
of your signal is a biological mesh, mush, mushy mesh.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640
Well, the mushy mesh is kind of interesting

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.400
because we have, there are problems with light,

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.040
light scatters in the brain.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:02.600
So the photons don't just go linearly through.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.360
Whenever they hit an interface between fat and water,

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:09.080
lipid and water, they bounce off in different directions.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.960
And so you can come in with all the resolution you want.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:14.680
You could play in an incredibly detailed

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.560
high resolution pattern of light,

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:19.400
but the photons start scattering quite quickly.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:22.160
And by the time you've gone a couple of millimeters deep,

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.480
you've lost almost all that fine spatial information.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:27.920
So, but we've developed workarounds.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.080
The longer wavelength light you use,

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.040
if you get into the infrared, there's less scattering.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:34.800
You can use two photon methods or three photon methods

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.000
where the photons have to arrive all together

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.480
at the same time.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.080
You can put in fiber optics.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.400
We developed these fiber optic methods in 2007,

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.080
where you can access these deep structures

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.280
with fiber optic methods.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.840
And you can put in many of these fiber optics

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.680
at the same time in an animal.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.320
We've used a holographic methods, 3D holograms

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.920
to play in hundreds of individual cell sized spots of light

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.120
and we can change those quickly.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.360
And so there are a lot of tricks,

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:01.840
a lot of interesting optics engineering

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.880
that has come together with neuroscience

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:04.800
in a pretty exciting way.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:06.040
Well, but it's engineering too.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.680
It was just super, super, super exciting.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.880
I should have mentioned, cause I remember,

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.200
I mentioned Elon, I recently got,

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:15.760
for the first time ever, got COVID.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.040
How did I go so long without the, finally,

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.360
so I'm all vaccinated and everything like that.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.920
And so I got, cause I think he mentioned it publicly

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.040
so I can mention it,

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.640
but I won't mention anybody else involved.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.800
But hanging out, we all got, Elon got COVID.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.200
And the interesting thing about,

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.560
maybe you can comment about this.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.880
So I was only sick for like a half a day.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.880
I got a fever of like 104, just went up and then crashed.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.640
And then I was, now maybe I'm just seeing

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.800
the silver lining of everything, but afterwards,

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.600
I have like a greater clarity about the world.

01:21:57.600 --> 01:21:58.800
You just think it's greater clarity.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:03.800
Maybe, maybe I just, it was so, maybe so intensely,

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:07.920
the mind fog kind of thing for such a short amount of time,

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:12.080
but the people weren't involved or also reporting this.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.200
It's kind of interesting.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.320
Cause like, because I do know,

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.360
like the immune system is involved with the brain

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.880
in very interesting ways.

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.760
Like the human mind also incorporates all these other,

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:28.120
it's not just the, it's not just the nervous system.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.200
And I just wonder, cause everyone always says,

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.240
no, not like, everyone always says like,

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.720
COVID does all these bad things or whatever the disease is

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:36.080
or whatever the virus.

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.720
But I wonder like, I hate to be a Steven Pinker on this,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.160
but like, I wonder what the benefits of certain disease are

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:43.880
if you're able to recover.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.480
Like what, is there some like, again,

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.560
don't want to romanticize it,

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.200
but if your system goes to some kind of hardship

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.920
and you come out on the other end,

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.880
I wonder sometimes if there's a greater,

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:56.480
maybe killed off a bunch of neurons

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:57.440
that I didn't need anyway,

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.880
and they were actually getting in the way.

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.600
There were the hater neurons.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.440
I don't know.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.520
Your inner critic that I was talking about.

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.360
Exactly.

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.080
Killed off your critic.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.360
Well, you know, there are mechanisms for what,

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.480
the potential mechanisms for what you're talking about.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:13.280
There are, there's actually been a fair bit of research

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.280
on post COVID neurological function.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.960
Actually, my wife, Michelle Monge, who's at Stanford,

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.360
she's done a lot of this work.

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.520
Akiko Iwasaki at Yale has done a lot of this.

01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:30.320
But what they found is that there's a loss of myelin.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:33.360
This is the coating of those long range projections

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.440
that go from one part of the brain to another.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.560
Myelin is this sort of insulator

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:39.240
that coats these long range projections

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.240
and makes the impulses go faster and more reliably.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.240
And there's altered function of the myelin producing cells

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.680
and altered myelin in the case of COVID.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:55.640
They've looked in both mouse and human brains.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.000
And, but of course it could be very idiosyncratic.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.400
Many people have cognitive problems post COVID.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.520
You're definitely aware of that.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.240
So many people report this persistent brain fog

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.960
and the ability to function.

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.000
But it depends on where the inflammation was.

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:15.000
Maybe the people who have dysfunction post COVID,

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.080
they had a global effect.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.320
Maybe you lost some of these projections

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.720
that were restraining you in some way.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.320
And these plausibly exist.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.040
And it's known that there are cell populations

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.360
in the prefrontal cortex

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.080
that actively restrain deeper structures

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.400
from expressing what they do.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.800
And it's theoretically possible

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.000
that you had a lucky.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.440
Somebody has to get lucky, right?

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:44.080
Somebody has to get lucky.

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.200
Why not?

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.040
All right.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.920
If we can actually go back to this idea

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:51.800
of trying through optogenetics

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:58.760
to find origins of when the wave first starts,

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:01.800
origins of a decision,

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.040
origin of idea,

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.240
origin of maybe consciousness

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.760
or the subjective experience,

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.160
or origin of things in the mind.

01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.120
So one thing, it's Carl Jung.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.520
Is there a God neuron?

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.080
Is there a belief neuron?

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:27.600
Is there, through this methodology of optogenetics,

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.600
can you start getting to where a belief begins

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.720
or an idea begins?

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.080
And especially looking at the strongest of our beliefs,

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:43.280
maybe beliefs of love and hate,

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.280
but religious belief into something like really grand

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.920
on the grandest of scale.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.360
Neuroscience and neurology point us a little bit.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.920
We don't have an answer to that, but for example.

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.360
A lot of these questions I'm gonna ask you,

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.280
there's no good answer,

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:08.080
but you're providing the tools that give us hope

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.640
to find the answer one day.

01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:11.040
Yeah, and we have early clues.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.680
So for example, when patients with epilepsy

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.280
have experiences of religiosity

01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:23.560
as part of their seizure or the aura before their seizure,

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:27.640
very often those are in the temporal lobe,

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.320
in these parts of the brain that are at the side.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.440
And so that's initial clue.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.320
There are also parts of the brain

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:41.320
that are involved in the definition of the self

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.680
and defining the borders or boundaries of the self.

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.560
And we know this,

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.480
there's just some experiments that we did in my lab.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.640
There's a part of the brain

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:56.240
where if there's a rhythm of a particular type,

01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:00.720
you can cause a separation of the sense of self

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.840
from the sense of the body.

01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:05.120
What's normally bound up and unitary,

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.720
we normally think of ourself and our body

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:08.880
as pretty tightly bound up together.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.440
Those can be separated, it turns out.

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:11.680
We can't take that for granted.

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.760
And there are certain conditions,

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.640
certain patterns of activity in one part of the brain

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.880
called the retrosplenial cortex

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:20.960
where you can actually separate those two out.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.920
And so if you think about these very big questions,

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:30.200
where are the origins of religiosity?

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.200
How do we define the boundaries of who we are

01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.560
relative to others and to the world?

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:40.520
How do we link ourself to our body

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.160
and how can that become separated?

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.120
These are actually, believe it or not,

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:49.000
now accessible and rigorously and quantitatively so.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:50.920
We did an experiment with optogenetics

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.680
where we provided this abnormal rhythm

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:57.160
to this particular part of the mouse brain.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:02.160
And we saw this separation of detection of a stimulus

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.640
and caring about it.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.640
So that's stimulating something about the mouse brain

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:11.960
that affects these neurons that give the conception of self.

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.400
So you're able to dissociate the experience

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.960
from the impact of the experience unto you.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:19.520
That's right, exactly right.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:22.160
So these are the goals of meditation.

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.840
These are the goals whenever I get drunk,

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.360
pretty much effective.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.040
I mean, that's not a scientific statement,

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.960
just an experiential anecdotal one.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.080
Also psychedelics seek to attain this kind of state.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.160
That's so interesting.

01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:42.960
Well, you mentioned psychedelics, DMT and 5-MEO DMT.

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:46.760
These create this religious experience, this connection.

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.720
People describe them as a strong connection to God.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:53.440
In theory, these are accessible with modern methods.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:56.240
Now that we have these rich recording methods,

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.240
we can explore what are the precise millisecond resolution,

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.320
cellular resolution, brain-wide manifestations

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:06.680
of these altered states.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.080
So like you could look at an altered state like on DMT,

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:14.600
record it across many people.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:18.040
And then from there, see where do these experiences

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:21.600
originate in the brain in terms of single neurons?

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.280
And then how do they propagate

01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:26.560
and interact with everything else?

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.000
And if there's some kind of common signal,

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.360
like how do you narrow down the set of neurons

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.760
that are responsible for particular experience

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.920
or for a particular behavioral effect?

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.480
Here's where optogenetics is so useful

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:45.480
because anytime you give an agent like ketamine or PCP,

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.520
which we used for our dissociation experiments

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:50.680
that I was mentioning,

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:55.040
or you have a psychedelic LSD or DMT

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:57.920
for this altered perceptual state,

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.600
if you give either of those,

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.040
these change everything across the brain, okay?

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.080
So just the fact that you maybe give them to a mouse,

01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:08.120
let's say, or eventually to a human,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.680
you won't know yet which cells to home in on

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.200
as the causal players in all this

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.400
just by recording the activity.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.960
But then what we found is that optogenetics

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:24.920
providing a causal pattern of activity guided

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.080
by what you see can let you test hypotheses.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.200
And we saw this rhythm with ketamine and PCP

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:32.920
for dissociation, and then we said,

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.880
okay, let's test what's causal.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.120
We came in and provided that rhythm.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.520
We tried a few different things,

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.920
but only one of the causal tests we tried

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:45.120
actually caused the behavioral dissociation.

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:47.320
And so that's how we home in on what actually matters.

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.280
And is it repeatable once you see the causal?

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.320
So that's one definition of causality,

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:55.160
is you try and it repeats across different mice

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.120
and all that kind of stuff.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:56.960
Exactly.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.000
And so you could do that for DMT.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.360
You could do that for the really fascinating mind expanding.

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:05.960
Thank you.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.800
Thank you for the,

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.400
so the meme for people just listening,

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.200
this is, again, another disagreement

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.480
between Freud and Carl Jung,

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.160
religion and spirituality.

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:17.040
This is the, I guess, the ring scene

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.920
from Lord of the Rings.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.840
Religion and spirituality, Freud says,

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:23.520
cast it into the fire, destroy it.

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.320
Carl Jung says, no.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:26.600
So for people who don't know,

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:31.600
Sergei is the Slavic lord of the meme.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.800
Thank you, I appreciate that.

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.720
So what were we talking about?

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.720
So there is, I mean, I think a connection

01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:38.560
between DMT and religious experiences

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.400
are some of these psychedelics.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.920
Do you think it's possible to

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.400
sort of stimulate religious experiences?

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.120
So religious experiences are one of the most

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.640
deep kind of experiences.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:57.160
And so here you could first understand

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:01.400
where they originate, how they propagate to the brain,

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.920
and then to stimulate them.

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.000
And so this is, and these can happen in people

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.720
who had no predisposition.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.960
People who are as agnostic or atheistic as you'd like,

01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:17.720
they can have these, they can feel connected

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.160
to God in these states.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.960
Now, to be clear, I'm not advocating these.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:24.760
We don't know what's safe in human beings,

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.920
but we definitely, not yet,

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.560
but we definitely can do these experiments in mice.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.320
And that was already very productive

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.680
in understanding dissociation.

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:37.360
So we can already imagine making headway on these methods.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:38.480
And then, you know, I had a,

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.960
and this does map onto the non-psychedelic human experience.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.720
I had a patient who's actually described

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:47.280
in the book, Projections.

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.720
This was the patient that's in the mania chapter,

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.600
the bipolar chapter.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:56.320
Here was a guy who had never had a psychiatric illness

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.360
or symptom in his life.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.640
He was a retirement age gentleman

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.880
and nobody in his family either.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:05.000
So no family history, no personal history

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
of any psychiatric illness.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.800
And he had never been religious particularly before either.

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:13.320
Certainly no passionate, you know, type of religion.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.880
But he, not through any psychedelic or drug,

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:18.040
he had a stressful experience,

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:21.680
actually a post 9-11 change in how he was thinking.

01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:24.920
And he was pushed into a mania, a manic state,

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.800
revealing that he had bipolar,

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.640
never before known in this case, in this person.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:33.960
And his mania, his elevated state in bipolar

01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.120
included this profound religiosity he had,

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.280
which he had never had before.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.280
And he was, you know, preaching in a elevated,

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.160
you know, vigorous way to his family.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.080
And so this state can be created in people

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:52.600
even late in life who had no predisposition for it

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:55.040
and no, even without a neurochemical.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:59.440
So there's the causality of that

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.840
is very interesting to explore.

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:05.960
How did the manic state unleash this religiosity?

01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.640
But you see that in other realms of psychiatry too,

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:11.720
OCD can manifest as religiosity also.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.560
You can take people who never really had a religion,

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:18.520
never played a powerful role in their life.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.160
But then when their obsessive compulsive symptoms

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.200
become severe, they can manifest in this.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.360
I think I'm in that group.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:26.360
So I'm a bit OCD.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.760
We have, there's, I think these subreddits,

01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.880
one is oddly satisfying things.

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.000
So there's certain things that are really satisfying

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.640
to my OCD, I mean, my mild OCD.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:41.960
I think it's pretty much a religious experience.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.920
So I understand that there's, if it's not direct,

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:48.400
it's at least rhymes.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.880
So maybe can you speak to the,

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:54.760
as Sergey is probably desperately scrambling

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.080
to pull up oddly satisfying, thank you.

01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.320
People can check it out themselves.

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.760
It is, as the subreddit promises, oddly satisfying.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:08.040
Can we talk about bipolar and maybe depression?

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.520
Well, let's talk about, I mean, I don't know

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:13.960
if there's a nice way to discuss the differences

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.720
in the full landscape of suffering that's here,

01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.120
but maybe what is depression

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:23.280
and what are the types of depression?

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.240
What kind of depression have you seen

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.480
and experienced and researched

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.320
and how can people overcome it?

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:33.560
How can humans overcome it and deal with it,

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:34.960
live with it and overcome it?

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.960
So this is my clinical specialty.

01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:42.000
I see patients in my outpatient clinical work

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.400
with treatment resistant depression.

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.480
So very hard to treat severe illness

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.560
where medications haven't been working.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.600
I also see patients with autism spectrum disorders.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.520
These are my two clinical focal areas.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:02.560
But then I do emergency room work as well.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.120
But the depression, why do I focus on that?

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:11.120
It's so, one feels tantalizingly close

01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:16.800
to helping these people who are suffering so deeply.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:20.600
And that's why I focused on it is these are people who,

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.960
there may not even be anything situational

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:25.400
that's difficult or challenging in their life.

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.080
You can have people who seem to have everything

01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:28.920
that you would want.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.760
Every objective measure of the life is fine

01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:35.760
and yet they can be just hit with this unstoppable

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:43.320
hopelessness and inability to see into the future,

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.520
a discounting of the value of their own action.

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:51.000
Anything they can imagine themselves doing seems worthless

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.880
or they are unable to enjoy things.

01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.440
We call this anhedonia.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.600
There's no reward, no pleasure, not in food,

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.200
social interaction, movies, books,

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.880
anything that they would enjoy, positivity gone.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:09.280
They can have a profound negative internal state,

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.160
psychic pain and these things can seem

01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:16.920
and in the severe cases are inescapable.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.320
So what is going on?

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:23.440
Why is this state part of the human existence?

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.960
It's got a strong biological genetic link.

01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.320
We know that it's been linked to certain genes,

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:34.560
certain regions of the chromosome and twin studies.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.200
There's a clear genetic link.

01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:39.200
It doesn't explain everything, but it's a big part of it.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.360
Genetics are a strong contributor.

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:45.960
And although you can have depression

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.280
without anything terrible going on in your life,

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:52.080
symptoms can be made worse by stressors, by trauma.

01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.200
But at a very deep level,

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.960
there's nothing we can measure in a person objectively.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.480
So we don't have, there's not a known chemical,

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:07.040
not a known structure that's different,

01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.960
not a known brain activity pattern

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.040
that we can pick up with EEG.

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.520
A lot of people are exploring this,

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.280
but right now we have no objective measures.

01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:18.240
All we do is talk to people and we elicit these symptoms.

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:20.080
We explore them,

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.720
distinguish them from other possible causes.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.360
And then what do we do?

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.440
Well, we have a range of treatments.

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:30.520
We have medications that can help people,

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:32.360
do help people, but not everybody.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.360
And if they don't work,

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.800
then we can go to brain stimulation methods.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:39.680
We can do things even like electroconvulsive therapy,

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.440
which is very effective,

01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:45.960
but that's sort of the final thing we go to in the end.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.160
And so we have treatments.

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:52.000
They work for some people.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.400
They don't do everything we'd like,

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.520
but here's the problem is at a very deep level,

01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400
we don't understand really what's going on in the brain.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.000
We don't have a physical interpretation of the problem.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.600
We have all these symptoms,

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.600
but we can't yet point to a set of cells

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:10.360
or a set of circuits or an activity pattern

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:12.040
that is causing major depression,

01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:14.480
this disease state per se in human beings.

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:17.760
Why do you think you can't yet

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:19.240
from an optogenetics perspective?

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:22.120
Is it because there's so many possible causes?

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:24.840
Is it so many things involved?

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.480
So I think the answer is there are many things involved

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:30.560
and all these different symptoms that I've mentioned,

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.840
those we can study and those we can fix,

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.480
the individual symptoms.

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:37.120
And we can do this in animals to be clear.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.960
So in a mouse, for example,

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:42.760
we can instantaneously and precisely

01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.520
turn up or down the motivation of an animal

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.080
to overcome a challenge.

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.520
We can turn up or down its ability to be motivated by

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.520
or we think experience reward from situations or actions.

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:01.480
We can increase its apparent energy level,

01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:06.200
its drive to meet challenges.

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:10.120
We can turn up or down social interaction,

01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:12.320
all these individual features of depression,

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.600
individual symptoms.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.440
We now can point to exact projections and cells

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:20.720
that are causal in meeting these.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.760
But we don't know is why all these different symptoms

01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.480
show up together in major depression

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.040
in the human disease syndrome.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.640
And that's the mystery.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.960
It's sort of in other fields of medicine,

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.480
someone with congestive heart failure

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.760
who comes into the clinic,

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.080
they have very different symptoms.

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.520
They have shortness of breath and they have swollen feet.

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.240
Couldn't be two more different across the body

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.720
sets of symptoms.

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:49.760
Neither one obviously related to the heart,

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.800
but they're both happening

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:53.040
because the heart is not working as a pump.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.200
And now thankfully in cardiology,

01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.000
we understand these disparate symptoms

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.160
that seem totally unrelated

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.600
can be completely understood

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.760
because there's an altered pump action of the heart.

01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.320
That's what we are hoping for in psychiatry

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.640
and in the study of depression or any disease.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.600
These different symptoms,

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.760
the inability to enjoy things,

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:18.840
the hopelessness.

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.640
What's the unifying principle?

01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:23.480
Unifying.

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:25.200
I mean, is there some truth to that?

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:28.840
The Tolstoy quote that all happy families are alike

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:31.720
and each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.480
So basically, I mean, this is the human condition.

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.160
And then basically there might,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.280
so the physicists long to find the theory of everything.

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:48.240
Isn't understanding depression essentially

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.960
require you to really have the big theory of everything

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:53.960
for the human mind?

01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.840
I think it would certainly be nice

01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:59.720
to have a theory of everything.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.760
Don't get me wrong.

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.600
I don't think we need it.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.880
The understanding of the century.

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.280
It would be nice.

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:07.840
Well, it's also a good question if it's possible.

01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.800
Yeah, yeah.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.920
Well, that I have some thoughts on too.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.880
But to this specific question,

01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.360
I don't think we need a theory of everything.

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:20.400
I think there will be unifying principles we can get to.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.520
But even shy of that, we can treat symptoms

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.640
and that's a big step.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.920
And as you say, different unhappy families are different.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:30.080
Different unhappy people are different.

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:31.760
If we have somebody who comes to the clinic

01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:34.720
and I see someone with a profound anhedonia

01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:38.080
as one of their main symptoms, inability to enjoy things.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.400
And if I know based on optogenetics work and animal work

01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:44.720
that a particular medication can treat anhedonia,

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:47.360
even if it doesn't fix major depression in everybody,

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.400
if I treat that one symptom in that one person,

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.600
that's a good thing.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:55.320
And so we don't need the theory of everything

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.400
and we don't even need the unifying principle

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.640
to help people with insights that come from optogenetics.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.640
How much does talking help for diagnosis and for treatment?

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.800
Would you say for depression?

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:11.600
It's a big part of what we do.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:15.280
Every good psychiatrist should be a pretty adept

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:18.240
in these verbal communications and talk therapy

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:20.040
as part of what they do.

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:22.920
I give medications, I deliver brain stimulation treatments,

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:26.360
but a big, big part of everything I do with every patient

01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.040
is talk therapy because it works so well together

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:33.320
with these other modalities.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.240
Even alone, it can help people with moderate

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.000
or mild depression by itself.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.600
People with severe depression,

01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:46.320
people with other psychiatric illnesses that are severe,

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:47.840
you don't wanna do talk therapy alone,

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:50.480
it's not gonna do it, but it still is crucial

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.240
to do together with the others.

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.240
And it's critical because it's part of how you reshape

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.360
cognitions, complex activity patterns,

01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.600
and you won't get to that with a medication

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.440
or a brain stimulation treatment.

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.840
Do you have advice for people who suffer

01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:12.720
from mild forms of depression or feel as they might,

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:16.600
both for those people and do you have advice for people

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:20.840
who love the people who suffer from depression

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.160
and want to help?

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.400
Yeah, one of the incredibly frustrating things

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.600
about depression is the very nature of it

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.280
makes it hard for the people who suffer to get treatment

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.840
because they're hopeless.

01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.560
So they don't think treatment will help.

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:40.640
They have low energy, so they're not motivated

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.680
to participate in treatment in many cases.

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.560
Sometimes they're actively suicidal,

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.360
that certainly doesn't help.

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:53.360
They have all these things that seem to prevent treatment

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:54.720
from being effective.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.440
So the loved ones, that's where the loved ones

01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:59.880
are so important is helping them overcome these barriers

01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.120
to treatment, the motivation, the safety and the insight.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.560
That's critical and particularly for the severe cases.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:13.880
For the mild cases where people still have some insight

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.680
and motivation and energy to get something done,

01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.280
there are many things you can do.

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:25.560
Exercise is extremely important in mood, maintenance,

01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:28.520
regulation of sleep and getting sufficient

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.200
and regular enough sleep is very important.

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:33.560
And talk therapy can be helpful in those mild

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.400
or moderate cases, just looking at cognitions,

01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.720
looking at patterns of thought that people

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:43.560
may have fallen into, where they catastrophize,

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:47.680
where they spiral from small things into big things.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.680
A little bit of talk therapy, 10, 12 sessions

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:55.720
can help people identify those patterns they may have

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:00.720
in themselves that are taking occasional negative thoughts

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.840
which everybody has and magnifying those

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.680
into more persistent negative states.

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.840
Once you, if you work at this, it's kind of like homework.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:14.080
This is what we call cognitive behavioral therapy.

01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:16.320
It's very structured, very organized, you work hard,

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.120
it requires insight and motivation

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.360
and you have to be motivated.

01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:23.440
But if you are, then you can identify these triggers

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.320
that send you down particular pathways.

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.120
And work to intercept them.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.520
And that is amazingly very effective

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:32.360
in mild to moderate cases.

01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:35.480
So you're basically have to train yourself

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.320
to see the world as a collection of triggers.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:44.920
And you have to first understand, collect the data,

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.240
like basically see every experience

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.800
as a thing that creates a follow on emotion, a feeling.

01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.640
And like, I've learned this, you know, like on social media

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.480
where like early on, you know, like all of us, you know,

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:10.840
I'll say something, I kind of respond to negativity

01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:15.840
with negativity and then you observe the results of that.

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.240
And then over time, you think, wait a minute,

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:24.080
this thing that I've been doing where

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:27.560
when somebody says you suck and you say, no, you suck,

01:47:29.040 --> 01:47:33.000
that never produces the result you thought it might.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.000
And so might not want to just don't say you suck back.

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.680
And I do this through a lot of things in life.

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.480
I'm very fortunate to not suffer from depression,

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.400
but I, first of all, I have had

01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.160
and have people in my life who do.

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.120
And also, you know, all of us have depression

01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.760
who don't suffer from depression and have depression out.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.160
Like it's always knocking on the door.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.400
Right.

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.400
And so you have mild, I mean,

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:14.320
if you're very careless with the triggers all around you,

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.080
then you, you're just, I think all of us

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:19.720
have the capacity to really suffer

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.720
from that kind of chemical or psychological

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:26.240
or philosophical existential crisis.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.400
But then it raises the question, why are we built this way?

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.720
It seems like it doesn't make sense, right?

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.440
And here's where some of this thinking

01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:38.960
about where we came from as the human family

01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:40.520
is kind of interesting.

01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:44.440
It doesn't make sense that somewhere on that spectrum

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:48.240
that it's good to detect that there's an array

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.920
of adverse forces out there in the world right now

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:56.920
at this moment and to withdraw, to hunker down,

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.520
to not fight, not strive, not try to meet the challenge

01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:06.600
and outweigh these negative forces

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.240
that are present out there.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.760
And that makes a lot of sense.

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:14.000
And all animals that have been studied

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
in one form or another show this.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.280
Even the worm that I mentioned earlier,

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.960
C. elegans with 302 neurons,

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:24.040
it can effectively give up in challenging situations.

01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:25.920
We've done this with zebrafish,

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:28.440
tiny little transparent fish.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.400
You can give them a challenging situation

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.320
and they will give up.

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.960
But then if you stimulate a couple

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.200
of very specific brain regions in particular ways,

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.480
you can motivate them to overcome the challenge.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.800
And if you inhibit those regions,

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:44.680
they give up much more easily than they would otherwise.

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.240
You can do this in mice, you can do this in rats.

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:49.880
So this is an ancestral conserved pattern

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.000
to detect that things are pretty bad out there

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.680
and to conserve energy, to hunker down,

01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:00.240
to wait out the storm.

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.320
So as you, unfortunately, many of our maladies

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:09.360
have useful roots that contribute to our survival.

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.920
So both depression and motivation have uses.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:18.560
And sometimes it's nice to just shut the hell up

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.040
and huddle with the penguins

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.720
versus for some unknown reason,

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:25.920
venture out on your own into the mountains

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.080
like a David Goggins type character.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:31.680
So what's the difference to you between,

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.120
you see patients between sort of rigorous psychoanalysis.

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:40.320
I don't know if you consider

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:41.920
like talk therapy and psychoanalysis,

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.080
are they neighbors, are they overlapping?

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.280
They're neighbors.

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:49.160
Psychoanalysis is, it's a, they're relatively,

01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:51.960
it's not nearly done as much as the talk therapy

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.160
like the cognitive behavioral therapy I mentioned.

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.600
The behavioral, yeah.

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.600
The psychoanalysis is a little more niche now

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.160
and partly because it's not,

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:06.960
data isn't, in terms of actual treatment

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.120
of actual therapeutic effects,

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:13.120
data not as supportive as for cognitive behavioral therapy.

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.040
But it's still interesting as for insight.

01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.600
People, a lot of people still do it

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.800
to gain insight into themselves.

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.240
And in general, it's a good sort of conversation starter.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:27.520
Those methods, they're good for getting things out.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:30.360
We don't focus on dreams typically these days

01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:32.600
in psychiatry, but they're great conversation starters.

01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:35.600
They're great ways to get things out if people have.

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.080
And so we like to use those methods

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.120
just to get the ball rolling sometimes,

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.000
get people to open up a little bit.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.040
But the actual treatment that tends not to involve

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.120
these psychoanalytic approaches

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.600
where you are really probing the unconscious mind

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.760
and its manifestation through dreams,

01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:58.080
for example, as the goal.

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.280
That's not the goal.

01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.600
Modern talk therapy, we're really focusing on treatment,

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.080
how to get people to feel better.

01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:05.160
See, I use that as a conversation opener,

01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:09.880
the Freudian thing where I try to delve at a bar

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.280
of the deep sexual desires in a person's subconscious

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:16.080
and I find that opens up possibilities very quickly.

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.400
No, what's, I mean, this is a silly sounding question,

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.640
but what's the difference

01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:26.080
between cognitive behavioral therapy and conversation?

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:30.360
So, because I personally, as a fan of conversations,

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.800
as a fan of just, I like listening to podcasts

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.400
versus like audio book.

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:37.040
I like both, but they're very different.

01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.640
And I like conversation.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:41.280
I like, it makes me personally very anxious.

01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:42.800
So I like to be the listener,

01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.080
like a third wheel,

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.720
like overhearing a conversation kind of thing.

01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:51.240
But it's a really powerful method for humans

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.400
to explore each other's mind, just raw conversation.

01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.320
So do you think it can be more productive

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.040
to be very systematic about it

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:04.760
or is conversation itself the art form of helping each other,

01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.800
understanding each other and helping each other?

01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.640
There are forms of talk therapy

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.000
that are essentially conversational

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.480
or they much more approach pure conversation.

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.160
There's a befriending therapy.

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.520
There's interpersonal therapy.

01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:23.080
These are approaches that are purely talk therapy,

01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:26.800
but they're not as structured as cognitive behavioral therapy.

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.960
Cognitive behavioral therapy is,

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:31.040
there are manuals, there are guidelines.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:33.720
You can almost go through it in a very cookbooky way.

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.720
There's homework that you get done.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.680
So it's in its fullest form,

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:42.160
it's very different from these more conversational strategies.

01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:44.280
But what's interesting is sometimes people compare them.

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:47.800
And so you'll see almost like randomized controlled studies

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:51.320
comparing cognitive behavioral therapy

01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.160
with interpersonal therapy, for example.

01:53:53.160 --> 01:53:54.920
And they both can work.

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.000
And actually in some studies they look comparable.

01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:02.040
So there's, to your point,

01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:04.520
conversation and insights that come from conversation,

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:09.040
if done well, if done artfully, can be as powerful.

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.920
This reminds me of Robin Williams.

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:13.960
So I have to ask you several questions here on that.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:17.000
But one of my favorite movies is Good Will Hunting.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.400
I don't know if you've seen it with Robin Williams.

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:21.960
So as a psychiatrist yourself,

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:23.960
can you do a deep analysis

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.680
of this other famous psychiatrist,

01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:29.080
which is the movie character played by Robin Williams

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.760
at Good Will Hunting?

01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:33.320
Is it just a caricature between a psychiatrist

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.360
and patient relationship?

01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:39.400
Or is there something to you that was moving

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.280
about his ability to connect

01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.320
to this obviously struggling young kid?

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:46.600
I think you've hit on the key thing there,

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:48.880
which is the depth of the connection.

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:53.920
If there's too powerful a connection

01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.400
that can impair therapy

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:01.200
because it could impair open communication.

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:05.600
If someone, if a patient sees the role,

01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:08.200
sees the relationship in a particular way,

01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.760
like in a friendly way, maybe,

01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:14.440
or like a parental child type way,

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:16.520
that can cause problems

01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:18.640
because then what they choose to share,

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:20.400
what they choose to bring up,

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:22.880
is selected to be appropriate

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.600
for that view of the relationship.

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.520
And so I and many other talk therapists

01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.640
actually prefer not to let things get,

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.520
not let the connection get that deep.

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:39.200
You wanna have trust,

01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:41.600
you wanna have a therapeutic alliance,

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.640
we sometimes call it.

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.200
But it's got to be enough of a blank slate

01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.160
that the patient is not consciously or unconsciously

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:54.520
constrained in what they choose to share.

01:55:55.800 --> 01:56:00.800
And so great movie, great actors, all good,

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:06.360
no complaints, except realistically,

01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.480
the relationship should be a little more

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:09.640
arm's length than that.

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:13.160
Let's pretend this is real life.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.920
Sometimes can't you leave a little bit of yourself

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.560
in the interaction with the patient?

01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.520
I mean, it's another human being.

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.440
Yes, so there's a balance

01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.400
and actually you do need some of it

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:28.840
because let's say this person is having challenges,

01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.760
interpersonal challenges in their life.

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:35.040
The best way to notice what those are

01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.880
and to identify them and to work with them

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.200
is if you can elicit some of those problems

01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.600
in the office, in the therapeutic interaction.

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.960
And this is really powerful.

01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.400
As long as you're alert to it, aware of it,

01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:56.960
and you don't let it go out of hand,

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.960
this transference, we call it,

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.960
is when you transfer in between

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:06.360
the current therapeutic relationship

01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.560
and external relationships

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.760
that the patient may have had with others.

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.920
And so if the therapist starts to feel

01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:19.040
an inner feeling like anger, let's say,

01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:20.040
so let's say you have a patient

01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.400
who is stirring frustration in you

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.440
or even in extreme cases, anger,

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:27.960
the best thing for the therapist to do in that case

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.160
is to recognize it and to realize

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:33.720
that's probably being stirred

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:35.880
by other people in the patient's life.

01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:38.160
And that could be the source of a lot of problems.

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:41.000
And so instead of trying to wall it off

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.880
and say, oh, I shouldn't be feeling that,

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:45.240
I better be a better therapist instead

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:49.000
and recognize it and use it and help the patient that way.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.360
And so you've gotta be a human being.

01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.840
You've gotta be a person who feels.

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.440
You've gotta be open.

01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:57.280
But be in control of it and be aware of it.

01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.120
If I may, I just wanna read the,

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.760
because it's one of my favorite scenes,

01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:03.320
probably one of the greatest scenes,

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:05.280
one of the greatest scenes in movie history

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:08.200
because Robin Williams does a single take.

01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.120
Is that right?

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.040
So this is a very interesting interaction between them.

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:15.400
So Will, and I'm sure this is a common interaction,

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.080
maybe with a therapist and a patient,

01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.280
maybe with a father and son,

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.480
where Will, the young character,

01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:25.040
they're a young brilliant mathematician

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.360
and Sean is the therapist, the older therapist,

01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:31.800
where Will looks at a painting that Sean painted

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.200
and then does like a deep critical analysis

01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.920
of the painting that basically, you know,

01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:42.040
describes pretending as if he can understand

01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.440
another human being completely

01:58:43.440 --> 01:58:45.440
by just looking at their painting.

01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:48.120
And then Sean gives this whole speech

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:52.360
that contrasts sort of raw intelligence

01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:54.320
and the wisdom of experience.

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.880
And Sean says, single take.

01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:59.640
He says, you've never been out of Boston, right?

01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:01.280
And Will says, nope.

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:03.680
All this in a sexy Boston accent, by the way.

01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:07.440
And then Sean gives the speech.

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.880
If I asked you about art,

01:59:08.880 --> 01:59:10.400
you'd probably give me this skinny

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.000
on about every art book I've ever written.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.720
Michelangelo, you know a lot about him.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.600
Life's work, political aspirations,

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.760
him and the Pope, sexual orientation,

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:21.400
the whole works, right?

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:22.920
But I bet you can't tell me

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:26.080
what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.680
You never actually stood there

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:31.520
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seen that.

01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:32.840
If I asked you about women,

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:34.880
you'll probably give me a syllabus

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.760
of your personal favorites.

01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:40.240
You may have even been laid a few times.

01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:42.760
The language here is just beautiful.

01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:45.440
But you can't tell me what it feels like

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:48.240
to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy.

01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.640
You're a tough kid.

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.800
If I asked you about war,

01:59:51.800 --> 01:59:54.480
you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right?

01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:57.400
Probably not, but let's say.

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.880
Once more into the breach, dear friends.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:02.240
But you've never been near one.

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:05.080
You've never held your best friend's head on your lap

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:07.120
and watched him gasp his last breath,

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:09.320
looking to you for help.

02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:11.480
If I asked you about love,

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:13.360
you'd probably quote me a sonnet.

02:00:14.480 --> 02:00:18.600
But you've never looked at a woman and be truly vulnerable,

02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:21.800
known someone who can love you with their eyes,

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.440
feeling like God put an angel on earth just for you,

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.800
who could rescue you from the depths of hell

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.400
and you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel.

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:34.360
To have that love for her,

02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:38.400
be there forever, through anything, through cancer.

02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:40.320
And you wouldn't know about sleeping,

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:42.680
sitting up in a hospital room for two months,

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:46.320
holding her hand because the doctors could see in your eyes

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:49.240
the terms visiting hours don't apply to you.

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:51.280
You don't know about real loss

02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.200
because that only occurs when you love something

02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:56.680
more than you love yourself.

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.880
I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much.

02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.280
I look at you.

02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.720
I don't see an intelligent, confident man.

02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:08.920
I see a cocky, scared, shitless kid.

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.400
But you're a genius, Will.

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.080
No one denies that.

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.840
No one can possibly understand the depths of you.

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:16.760
But you presume to know everything about me

02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:18.760
because you saw a painting of mine,

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:21.680
you ripped my fucking life apart.

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:22.940
You're an orphan, right?

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:25.320
Do you think I know the first thing

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:27.640
about how hard your life has been,

02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:31.760
how you feel, who you are, because I read Oliver Twist?

02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:33.960
Does that encapsulate you?

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:36.000
Personally, I don't give a shit about all that

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.520
because you know what?

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.200
I can't learn anything from you

02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:41.720
that I can't read in some fucking book

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:45.240
unless you want to talk about you, who you are.

02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:47.520
And I'm fascinated, I'm in.

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:50.360
But you don't want to do that, do you, sport?

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.640
You're terrified of what you might say.

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:55.800
Your move, chief.

02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:57.480
Well done, sir, I know it's a movie.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:58.800
It's interesting, right?

02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:00.120
So some of that conversation

02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:03.120
is at some intellectual level, too.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.040
It's not just emotional, it's something,

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:09.560
it's like, the reason I kind of connect with that

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:14.280
is that's a lot of work for a therapist.

02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.120
Like, to really understand another,

02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.480
because he's, I mean, from, okay, I know this is fictional,

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.840
but just, there's calculation happening.

02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:26.040
He deeply cares to say the words

02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:27.960
that the other person needs to hear,

02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.600
but also a little bit loses himself in the pride,

02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.240
but then catches himself again,

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:38.600
switches from anger to connection.

02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:40.920
Yeah, a lot is brought up there.

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.880
You're right, there has to be some emotion

02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:46.160
in the therapist to care enough to keep going,

02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:51.160
to keep probing, to open up as he's doing so, right?

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:53.960
He revealed a lot about himself, his own vulnerabilities,

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:56.760
but that gave him authenticity.

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:00.000
He had to open himself up so that the kid

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.800
would see the authenticity and open himself up in return.

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:10.080
So how do you do that as a psychiatrist, as a therapist?

02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:10.920
You have to be careful.

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:13.760
You don't wanna do too much,

02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:17.560
but opening up a little bit does help.

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.280
It does create a chance.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:21.400
You're offering up something,

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:24.720
and that helps the patient come back in return.

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:28.760
And it gives you that believability and authenticity.

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:31.400
Do you pay the price for that, for opening it up?

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:32.920
You can.

02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:33.880
You have a family,

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:38.280
you have an incredibly difficult research.

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.400
You're doing a lot of things in your world.

02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.520
I mean, it's a price you pay for like...

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.760
Well, this was one of the terrifying things

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:48.600
about writing the book was,

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:52.600
I do open up in a little bit about my own personal life,

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.840
my own personal challenges,

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.520
and that was a considered decision

02:03:55.520 --> 02:04:00.520
because I could have done the patient work

02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.200
and the science work

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:04.880
and the history of the human family work

02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.480
and tied it all together.

02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:12.880
But it wasn't, in an early draft, it was like that,

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.600
but it wasn't real yet.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.520
It wasn't something that everybody could connect with.

02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.320
And I said, then I realized, look, if I'm gonna do this,

02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:26.320
I've gotta open up myself

02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.360
and then people can connect with me

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:31.000
and see what I'm really saying.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:31.840
And so I did.

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.840
And that was not something that I'd gone in planning to do.

02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.320
In retrospect, I learned a lot about myself.

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:42.280
It was actually really, I think, a good thing that I did,

02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.760
but it was scary.

02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.880
Where are the darkest places you've ever gone in your life?

02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:52.880
You know, I had, things haven't always been easy personally

02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.320
or professionally.

02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:00.840
I had moments, I was effectively a single dad

02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:03.200
for a while, a number of years,

02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:05.320
and these came at probably the hardest,

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:09.440
also professional lifetimes for me too.

02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:11.720
The absolute hardest days

02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:16.560
of late medical school, internship, taking call,

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:21.560
getting up at 3 a.m., surgery, medicine, rounds,

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:26.200
unforgiving environments, and then all the while,

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:30.000
personal life stripped down to the bare.

02:05:31.120 --> 02:05:32.520
And these were low moments.

02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:36.600
And then I was hit particularly hard by just experiences

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:41.600
on the clinical ward, connecting too deeply with patients,

02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:45.680
like a child with a brain tumor and feeling it too strongly.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:51.000
And those things, when you get down to those lowest

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.560
of the low moments, when everything is stripped away

02:05:53.560 --> 02:05:58.560
and there's only this raw core, well, that's pretty hard.

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:02.080
That was probably the lowest moment.

02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:04.400
And you learn a lot about yourself in those moments,

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.400
what's left and then what are the roots out from there.

02:06:10.040 --> 02:06:15.040
And that can be powerful to see in yourself.

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:18.840
Have you thought about killing yourself?

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:20.240
I have not.

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:21.080
I have not.

02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:23.600
Have you seen that thought in the distance?

02:06:25.120 --> 02:06:28.920
I am fortunate that that has not come to my mind

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:32.000
and I have not seen it even in the distance.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:36.920
And in some ways, I've wondered if that's made me,

02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:40.760
am I a less effective psychiatrist because of that?

02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.080
I've felt everything stripped away.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:48.240
I've been at the lowest of the low and yet that-

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:49.080
There's still hope.

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:52.440
There's a light of hope still at the end of the tunnel.

02:06:52.440 --> 02:06:55.320
So you've never lost, even for brief moments, that-

02:06:56.840 --> 02:06:57.800
Never did.

02:06:57.800 --> 02:06:59.040
What was- I don't know why.

02:06:59.040 --> 02:06:59.880
You don't know why.

02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:00.840
There was no reason.

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:01.680
You don't know why.

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.880
No reason to feel hope at that moment, honestly.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:07.760
So it was just the light without reason.

02:07:07.760 --> 02:07:08.880
Yeah, that's right.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.240
What wisdom do you draw from that time?

02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:19.480
About, so first of all, you said something funny,

02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:22.040
which is I wonder if it,

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:26.480
that it's somehow not having thoughts of suicide

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:30.960
limits your capacity to truly understand somebody

02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:34.760
who is having those thoughts.

02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:39.360
So how many demons must a psychiatrist have

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:41.440
in order to be a good psychiatrist?

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:45.480
Yeah, you know, this is a really interesting question.

02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.600
I think everybody knows, and I can say this,

02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:50.720
that psychiatrists can be a little unusual.

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:53.720
We think about ourselves, right?

02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:54.800
We think about our brains.

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.960
That may be one reason why we become psychiatrists

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:59.360
is we think, oh, that's interesting going on in there.

02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:00.680
What's that about?

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:03.920
So a little introspective, a little introverted maybe,

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:07.120
and that's what can make us good when we're good.

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:12.680
And, but also that may select for people

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:14.720
who have some unusual aspects,

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:17.120
but you don't have to have all of them.

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:21.080
There's a lot that can go wrong in the psychiatric realm.

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:24.840
I think having some of those, some of it,

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.120
but not all of it is enough.

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:29.600
You get to see how low things can get.

02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:34.600
You can get a, you get empathy from that,

02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:38.360
even if the symptoms are not the same.

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:41.000
Just empathy for struggle, for suffering.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:42.760
That's right, that's right.

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.760
Do you yourself have to practice observing triggers

02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:49.440
just as a human operating in this world?

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:53.120
I've definitely, those skills that have come from therapy,

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.880
I've found them useful.

02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.960
If I noticed that we've all been through experiences

02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:03.320
where we wonder, oh, I got really mad in that interaction.

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.360
Why did I get that mad?

02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:07.000
Yeah, sure, maybe I could have been irritated,

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.680
but man, why did I?

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:12.760
And then thinking about it and realizing, okay,

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.560
back up here, think about the broader context,

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.200
think about how that relates to prior events in my life.

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:25.960
Okay, yeah, so this is a thing for me

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:28.400
when something of this class happens,

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.200
then it triggers me.

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:32.480
So going forward, I'm gonna be aware of that.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.280
And I've definitely used that because it's,

02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:40.400
you don't wanna be out of control of those emotions.

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.880
You wanna identify them, you wanna know where they come from,

02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.040
and you wanna head them off as a civilized human being

02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.080
living on this earth, trying to get along with other people.

02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.000
You wanna understand those moments.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.880
Let me return to Robin Williams for a second,

02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:00.800
and looking at Robin Williams, the actor,

02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:05.800
sorry, the human, because you mentioned for depression,

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.240
you can have everything going well.

02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:12.960
And I think there's just famous cases of just public figures

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.160
because a lot of people know them,

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.720
where they suffer quietly,

02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:22.680
and it seems like from the outside perspective

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.880
that they have everything going for them,

02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:27.240
that they're at the top of their career.

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:30.400
Two people that come to mind are Robin Williams

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.360
and Anthony Bourdain.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:36.600
What insight do you have in why either of those have taken,

02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:39.920
why Robin Williams, a comedian,

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:42.400
one of sort of the most jolly humans?

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:43.880
Obviously, there was always the darkness

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.880
that he was channeling in order to present the happiness,

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.200
but it feels like that realness is only possible

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:56.360
when you're deeply self-honest and analytical,

02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:59.480
and then if you're deeply self-honest,

02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:00.960
you're going to realize that there's a lot

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:03.640
of beautiful things about life that you can discover,

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:05.280
and if you do that,

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.840
how can you possibly then take your own life?

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.240
I mean, you go through all of these thoughts,

02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.240
and I think a lot of people really loved Robin Williams,

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:18.040
which is why it was really difficult to see,

02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:20.120
how can even him,

02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:22.280
how can even Robin Williams take his own life?

02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:24.680
So I don't know if there's something to be said

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:26.000
about the nature of depression

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.840
from just looking at his case.

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:33.120
I think the action of suicide is not well understood.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:34.640
It doesn't always,

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:37.680
although often is correlated with depression.

02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:39.320
There are cases of suicide

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:41.680
where there is not clear depression.

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:42.880
That's in the minority.

02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.240
By the way, if I just,

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:46.120
because you said it's so interesting,

02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.720
action of suicide,

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:49.840
because there's also thoughts of suicide,

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:51.360
and probably those,

02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:54.600
they're probably somewhat understood,

02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:55.880
but it's an interesting,

02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:59.280
because you can think of suicide,

02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.880
if you have suicidal ideation,

02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:03.960
you can think of that for so many reasons.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.800
That's right.

02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:13.680
I mean, thoughts sometimes,

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:16.360
like painful thoughts,

02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:17.280
angry thoughts,

02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.240
or thoughts in general,

02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:20.200
can be very different,

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:21.320
like fantasies, for example.

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:22.960
You can fantasize,

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:24.400
like sexual fantasies.

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.160
You can fantasize,

02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:28.520
I was just for humor's sake,

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.440
wanted to mention stuff,

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.840
but then people will think I'm serious.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.400
I'm not gonna mention anything.

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.160
But sexual fantasies,

02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.000
and then there's,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.440
I know there's people that have sexual fantasies

02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.600
and they don't wanna actually do that in real life.

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:41.440
That sexual fantasy serves some kind of purpose

02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:43.520
in imagination only.

02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:44.360
In that same way,

02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.960
suicide might serve a purpose in imagination only

02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:48.840
is very unlikely to lead to action.

02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:51.200
And yet there's other thoughts

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:52.560
that maybe are more amorphous

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:54.200
that do lead to action.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:55.840
And that leap,

02:12:56.880 --> 02:12:57.720
yeah, that,

02:12:57.720 --> 02:12:58.560
oh boy, that's a fascinating,

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:02.120
and that's such a philosophically powerful thought

02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:03.680
to not exist.

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.680
Like that question,

02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.680
that's this,

02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:07.880
is it Sarcher or Camus,

02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:11.000
Camus, or the mythicist Camus,

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:11.840
who says,

02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:14.440
like basic question of why live?

02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:17.280
Good question, yeah.

02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:18.120
Right.

02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.840
So that's a great question, actually.

02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:22.840
And there are other related questions.

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.360
Some people may have the thought of suicide

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:31.800
because there seems no point,

02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:33.200
there's no joy in life.

02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.800
That's one reason that some people can put forward.

02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:39.920
Sometimes it's not just the absence of joy,

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:41.520
there's an active pain,

02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.040
an active psychic pain in some people.

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.600
And the inescapability of that

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:50.520
is enough to drive the thoughts of suicide.

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:52.400
And then there are interpersonal

02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:54.680
and cultural reasons as well that can show up.

02:13:56.240 --> 02:13:57.320
But the act,

02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.080
this act of ending of the self is,

02:14:00.080 --> 02:14:01.120
in all these cases,

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:03.440
there's no real way to study this in animals,

02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:06.280
no other animal as far as we know that we can study

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.920
has this concept of,

02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:10.760
this is myself,

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:13.160
the situation is not tolerable,

02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:15.400
therefore I will end the self.

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.240
To our knowledge,

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:18.720
this is not something that can be studied in another animal.

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.720
So it remains this very poorly understood action.

02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:28.600
And in predicting it,

02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:29.840
so what do we do as psychiatrists?

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:30.680
We have this challenge,

02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:32.680
people come to the emergency room,

02:14:32.680 --> 02:14:33.960
they say they're suicidal

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.360
or their friends say they're suicidal

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:39.040
or they've taken some action that didn't lead to death.

02:14:40.200 --> 02:14:41.040
What do we do?

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:43.960
Well, there's a whole range of options.

02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:45.640
Was it a suicidal gesture

02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:48.280
in the sense of not intending death

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.880
or was the intent death?

02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:53.560
And if it was the intent was death,

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.400
what were the reasons?

02:14:54.400 --> 02:14:55.440
Are the reasons transient?

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:56.920
Are they gone now?

02:14:56.920 --> 02:15:00.160
What's the probability that it'll be repeated?

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:01.600
So we do all these things

02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.280
just to decide what sort of treatment should be carried out,

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:09.040
but nowhere is there a deep understanding of the biology,

02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:12.480
of the cells and circuits and activity patterns

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.840
that underlie the action to end the self.

02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:21.440
It's a very, it's this frustrating thing.

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:24.960
It's so timely, it's so common,

02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.760
it shows up in veterans, it shows up in kids,

02:15:27.760 --> 02:15:30.680
it shows up in people at every stage of life.

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.080
And yet we're very bad at understanding it

02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:37.040
and we're relatively poor at predicting it

02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:40.760
and our tools are not very powerful.

02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:42.720
We can put people in a locked unit,

02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:44.880
we can give them care therapy for a while.

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:47.160
At some point we release them

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:48.680
and there's only so much we can do.

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:50.880
It's one of the most frustrating things

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:53.640
about the suffering that is linked to suicidality.

02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:56.720
But it is a decision and it is an action.

02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:58.440
And if you look at optogenetics,

02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.800
you should be able to one day sort of understand

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.480
the dynamics of such weighty decisions.

02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:07.640
The individual causes then, if someone is anhedonic,

02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:09.400
if there is no joy in life,

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:12.800
that very likely is addressable by optogenetics.

02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:16.880
We know how to turn that dial very robustly in animals.

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:21.080
The motivation to overcome challenges that

02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:25.760
we have some hope of understanding.

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.400
Psychic pain, internal negative states,

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.360
we have actually a handle on that as well.

02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:33.000
There's a structure in the brain called the habenula

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.440
and some linked structures around it

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:39.120
that seems to generate this negative internal state.

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.520
It's active when a state of acute disappointment,

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:47.320
acute outcomes that go wrong, not as expected,

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.280
moments of unexpected pain.

02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:55.800
The habenula is there, it seems it's active

02:16:55.800 --> 02:17:00.800
to report on internal negativity with its action.

02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:02.720
And so you could imagine strategies

02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:03.920
to target this brain structure

02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:07.280
that might have the effect of reducing psychic pain,

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.800
reducing the negativity of internal states.

02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:12.000
That is a very concrete hope.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.200
It's precise, it's anatomical.

02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:17.440
Optogenetics has given us all the firm foundation we need

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:19.760
to go after that question.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:21.480
So I think there is hope.

02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:23.000
If you look at the individual causes,

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.960
the individual symptoms relating to suicide.

02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:27.000
And then it's like a puzzle,

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.360
you put together the puzzle pieces.

02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:33.360
By the way, I do think my habenula

02:17:33.360 --> 02:17:37.400
is very functioning, very actively.

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:39.920
And I wonder if it's like,

02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.160
because you can also learn to channel these things, right?

02:17:43.160 --> 02:17:45.920
Some of the things we suffer from,

02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:48.160
I mean, there's degrees of suffering,

02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:53.160
can be a source of progress and personal growth

02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.000
and development and all those kinds of things.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:01.120
I mean, what is it?

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:05.000
Nietzsche suffered from stomach issues.

02:18:06.160 --> 02:18:09.160
You know, I wonder if he's written some of those things,

02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:12.200
if his stomach was all great.

02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:13.040
Right.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.320
I mean, there's, I kind of think that

02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.520
a difficult life in some form,

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.840
you get to choose in some regard and some that you don't.

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:25.400
The difficulties you have and the ones you do have,

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.480
it's nice to use if possible.

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:28.800
Sometimes it's nice to treat,

02:18:28.800 --> 02:18:31.480
sometimes it's nice to use.

02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:33.600
Well, the way you phrase it, I think you're using it.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:36.600
I could be wrong, but if you phrased

02:18:36.600 --> 02:18:39.240
in this semi-humorous way about your habanula,

02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.840
it seems to me that you're using that to good effect.

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:46.360
Now, but one never really knows

02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:48.120
what someone else's internal state is.

02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:51.880
As I look at you, I don't know the depths of what's going on

02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.880
and it's possible that it's a much harder situation in there.

02:18:57.840 --> 02:18:58.720
Yes.

02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:00.440
So that's, I actually worry about this a lot.

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:02.160
So I'm extremely self-critical,

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:04.440
like in the privacy of my own mind,

02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.960
which is an interesting thing

02:19:05.960 --> 02:19:07.840
when you get to meet the internet

02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:10.000
and the internet will tell you you suck.

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.160
But for now, now this is what I worry about

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:16.880
and I'm very paying attention.

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:20.800
For now it's really, I just have this very negative voice,

02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:25.160
but that voice seems to be very useful for productivity.

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.360
And so I channel it.

02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:29.920
I just put it on the table and let that voice talk to me.

02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.000
But I'm very, I'm like monitoring that voice

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:35.800
because looking at Robin Williams,

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:38.960
you get older, your brain changes or like you're,

02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:43.600
and then that voice can now all of a sudden grow, right?

02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.400
And then where you can't control it as much.

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:47.920
You have to be very careful with these kinds of things.

02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:50.200
You're very right about that.

02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:53.120
So my negativity, I have this,

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.480
I never think I've done enough

02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:57.480
is sort of where my negativity comes from inside.

02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:02.480
I never think that I've met the potential

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.280
of the moment I haven't done,

02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:10.360
haven't made the most of the opportunities

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:12.200
that are available.

02:20:12.200 --> 02:20:16.680
Still early, I haven't progressed as far as I should.

02:20:16.680 --> 02:20:20.960
And exactly as you're saying, that works for a while,

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:23.680
but then what happens as you get later in life

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:28.680
and there's less runway to fix that.

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:33.040
And then maybe then that negative voice is a problem.

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:34.240
But also at that point,

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:36.760
the negative voice starts having more and more of a point

02:20:36.760 --> 02:20:39.920
between when you're being very successful,

02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:42.200
it's easy to be like, no, okay, well,

02:20:43.720 --> 02:20:46.640
like later in life, you're really literally just sitting

02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:49.720
there on a rocking chair doing nothing.

02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:53.680
And then it's, or maybe any kind of tragedy happens,

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:57.200
loss of a loved one, loss of a job,

02:20:57.200 --> 02:21:01.520
loss or you get screwed over in some kind of way.

02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:02.600
I don't know.

02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:04.200
And then all of a sudden the negative voice

02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.680
is just you and the negative voice

02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:07.960
for days and days and days.

02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:09.480
And so I don't know,

02:21:09.480 --> 02:21:11.160
to go back to your example of Robin Williams,

02:21:11.160 --> 02:21:13.440
I don't know what was going on inside him.

02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:15.440
I don't know the nature of his internal state.

02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:18.560
Was it active psychic pain that finally-

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:20.240
May I mention, may I interrupt to just say

02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:23.720
that Sergey posted an examination of Robin Williams'

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:27.360
brain tissue suggested that he suffered from, quote,

02:21:27.360 --> 02:21:32.360
diffuse L-E-W-Y, Lewy body dementia.

02:21:32.640 --> 02:21:36.560
L-B-D, depression is a symptom of L-B-D

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:38.280
and it's not about psychology.

02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.480
It's rooted in urology.

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.000
This is words from Sergey.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.640
His brain was falling apart.

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:45.360
Yeah, Lewy body dementia.

02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:47.680
This is a very interesting neurological disorder

02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:51.880
where among other things, there's neuron death indeed.

02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.560
So you've got frank neuron loss.

02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:58.280
It's not just a matter of some longstanding psychic pain,

02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:00.920
but you've got a progressive loss.

02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:03.000
And so clearly you've got a situation

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.480
where he could have finally reached a point

02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:07.520
where the balance that he'd worked out

02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:10.080
between negativity and positivity

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:12.440
was disrupted due to loss.

02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:13.480
The wrong cells died.

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:16.920
The wrong projections were cut by the Lewy body dementia.

02:22:16.920 --> 02:22:19.600
Certainly dopamine neurons die in Lewy body dementia.

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:23.440
Those are neurons that give rise to much of the feelings

02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:25.760
of reward and pleasure that we experience

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:27.360
among other roles.

02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:30.200
So clearly in his case,

02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:33.520
there could have been a very concrete cellular

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:35.280
neurological issue that was progressive

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:36.880
and pushed him to that point.

02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:41.720
But were you about to make a point about broader

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:45.040
that if there is a neurological degeneration?

02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:47.400
Yeah, so in his case, not knowing that,

02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:49.680
it could have been simply that,

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:52.800
let's say he had an internal psychic pain state

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:56.680
and he was in sort of a compensated mode

02:22:56.680 --> 02:22:57.520
for much of his life,

02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.840
able to generate enough joy from his comedy

02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.080
and his social interactions.

02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:04.000
And then, but eventually later in life,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.200
you know, those things drop away, the balance shifts.

02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:10.760
You get tired of fighting the pain for that long.

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:13.320
And then, so you've got this time dependent

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.760
non-stationarity that happens.

02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:18.320
And then the same symptom

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:20.320
becomes no longer tolerable in the end.

02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:22.720
What is autism?

02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:24.360
What do we know about autism?

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:28.120
Human beings exist on a spectrum

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:30.720
of how social we can be.

02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:34.640
And this is pretty interesting actually, scientifically,

02:23:34.640 --> 02:23:38.240
but also very important clinically.

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:39.640
There are hyper-social states

02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:42.800
where people are almost too social.

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:44.760
There are chromosomal deletion states

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:47.760
where people have instant affinity and bonding

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:52.760
and rich deep seeming connections with people, very verbal.

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:57.600
On the other end, people with autism spectrum disorder

02:23:57.600 --> 02:24:02.600
are not able to keep up with social interactions.

02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.560
And it's a spectrum.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:09.480
Some have mild to moderate difficulties.

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:13.800
They may have inability to understand

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:16.160
what the next thing to do in a social situation is,

02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:18.960
but may have perfectly good language abilities.

02:24:19.840 --> 02:24:21.880
And as you progress further along the spectrum,

02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:23.200
that gets more and more severe.

02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.200
So they can't make eye contact

02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:28.120
because it's too overwhelming

02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:29.800
to think about what has to be done next

02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:32.280
if a person looks in a particular way.

02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:33.480
And then as you go farther,

02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.040
then language and social communication themselves break down.

02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:42.000
So there's no reciprocity, there's no shared enjoyment.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.520
And that this gets very hard then

02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:45.360
as you get to this far end of the spectrum

02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:50.080
where there's really an absence of social cognition at all

02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.840
and social bonding.

02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:54.600
So why does this exist?

02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:55.640
What is it?

02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:56.880
It's very genetic.

02:24:56.880 --> 02:25:00.040
As I mentioned, it's one of the top three or four

02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:03.840
most biological in the sense of most genetically determined

02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:05.440
of the psychiatric illnesses.

02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:08.040
It does have these interesting positive correlations,

02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:09.280
slight positive correlations

02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:11.440
with intelligence and education.

02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.280
And the reason for that is kind of interesting

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:18.320
to think about.

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:19.520
Is there something good about it?

02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:23.080
Just like, or at least with at least part of the spectrum,

02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.000
is there something good about it?

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.240
Just as we were talking about for depression,

02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:27.480
as you could say for mania,

02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:29.240
as you could say for schizophrenia.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.720
And here it's kind of interesting to think about

02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:38.360
the underlying science of what it means

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.280
to be good at a social interaction.

02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:44.080
Someone who's very good at a social interaction

02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:48.440
is incredibly good at dealing with unpredictable information,

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.440
is able to handle this torrent of information

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:56.440
coming through rapidly changing model of the other person

02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.720
and of the interaction and their model of you,

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:02.520
your model of them.

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:03.920
With each word that changes,

02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:05.600
with each new bit of information

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:06.920
that comes in through the conversation,

02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:09.720
each bit of body language, all this is rapidly changing.

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:12.400
And some people are able to keep up

02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:15.640
with that firehose of information perfectly well.

02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:17.280
But that's a special brain state to be in.

02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:20.400
That's working with unpredictability.

02:26:20.400 --> 02:26:24.480
That's the only way that can be done

02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:29.080
is most likely by constantly running models

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.200
of what the other person might be about to say.

02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:33.360
So you can't stop and think,

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.360
oh, what did that word mean?

02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.640
What did that shift in eye contact mean?

02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:38.800
What do they mean together?

02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:41.200
There has to be some advanced work going on

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.440
where you're predicting what's going on

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:45.640
if you're to keep up with a rich and fast social interaction.

02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.600
Now, on the flip side, there are brain states

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:53.600
that maybe don't have to work so fast

02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:54.960
but that are extremely important still.

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:57.080
Dealing with something that's not moving

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:00.200
or that's predictable, still complex,

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:05.200
like mathematical proof or a very complex arrangement

02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:07.960
of geometrical shapes,

02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:11.120
a large number of individual non-moving things.

02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:13.640
There's possibly a way of being

02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:15.800
that's particularly good at dealing with these static,

02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:19.360
unmoving or predictable situations

02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:22.480
and less so with these rapidly changing social situations.

02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:25.960
And so the way I conceptualize autism

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:31.000
is these are people whose brains are not so good

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.440
with the high bit rate unpredictable information

02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:38.040
but may be quite good at given enough time,

02:27:38.040 --> 02:27:43.040
given the grace to work with,

02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:46.600
the system to look at it from different angles,

02:27:47.800 --> 02:27:49.720
to take different perspectives with a confidence

02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:52.840
that it's not changing in between perspectives.

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:55.640
That's a brain state that's valuable.

02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:59.560
It's something that has probably has contributed

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.120
to a lot of the success of the human family,

02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:02.320
being able to design something,

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.320
being able to consider all the different contributions

02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:12.760
to a static, predictable system.

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.840
So autism in a sense is a spectrum

02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:21.200
that has identifiable characteristics

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:25.120
about the way people deal with dynamic information,

02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:29.120
often expressed itself as like social dynamic information.

02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:31.200
But you critically, your use of the word often there

02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:34.400
is really, I think smart because it's not just

02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:37.280
social interaction that is a challenge in autism.

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:40.040
And so many people conceptualize it purely

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:44.840
as a social dysfunction disorder.

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:47.600
But it's really any unpredictable information

02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.560
that's a problem, that's a challenge

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:50.920
for people on the spectrum.

02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:55.920
They react very negatively to unexpected sounds

02:28:56.280 --> 02:28:59.320
even if not social sounds, unexpected lights,

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:01.200
unexpected touches.

02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:03.400
And so it's really unpredictable information

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:06.080
that is in my view the core problem

02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:09.240
with the processing in autism, not just social.

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:11.560
Social just shows up because it's so unpredictable.

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.000
Yeah, that's so interesting.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.840
I mean, I tried to not to think about that stuff.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:22.600
I'm afraid of thinking about disorders

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:25.480
and things like that because just like I don't like

02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:28.040
sort of economics or game theory,

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:30.240
I want to be careful with it

02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:34.360
because whenever you have a category or a model,

02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:39.360
it's too easy to just, it's the OCD thing.

02:29:39.440 --> 02:29:42.280
I like models too much, I like categories too much.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:44.240
The moment you acknowledge yourself,

02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:46.400
well, I have an eating disorder, for example,

02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:49.200
or something like that, as opposed to just being a,

02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.360
well, I'll just leave it at that

02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.560
for my own critical understanding of myself.

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:57.000
Let's just say I don't know how to moderate eating fruit.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:01.080
People make fun of me, they think all fruit is healthy.

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:05.240
No, well, I don't know how to moderate anything,

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:10.240
but even fruit, apples and cherries is a nightmare.

02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:14.440
Anyway, that's such a psychiatrist thing to say,

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:19.440
very interesting, but there's characteristics

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:23.560
and it's interesting to think about,

02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:26.560
like for example, I have trouble making eye contact,

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:29.040
but I actually, as you said it now,

02:30:29.040 --> 02:30:34.040
it's not that I'm shy at all in that sense.

02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:38.560
It's literally, I'm getting way too much information

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:40.240
and it's distracting me.

02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:44.080
Like I need to just close my eyes so I can,

02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:46.600
like all the things that people seem to be able to do

02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:51.040
in parallel, it's just, you just asked me a question,

02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:53.320
for me to think about the answer to that question,

02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:55.160
I can't have all this cool, rich,

02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:57.200
visual information coming my way.

02:30:57.200 --> 02:31:01.040
That's literally, because I often close my eyes to think,

02:31:01.040 --> 02:31:04.080
it's not because I'm afraid of something, whatever,

02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:06.360
it's just like too much information happening here.

02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:09.000
Yeah, well, that's a beautiful description.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.320
It's amazing that that is how you experience

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:15.680
the eye contact aspect.

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:18.840
I think that's, I mean, you've articulated what,

02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.640
captures it for so many people,

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:23.760
which is that it's overwhelming.

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:26.040
There's just too much information just coming in

02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:30.760
through the eyes and to keep up with it,

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:33.480
to know you're gonna be expected to keep up with it,

02:31:33.480 --> 02:31:35.160
first of all, so there's that aspect.

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:37.240
You know, you learned socially

02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:38.920
that there's gonna be an expectation.

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:40.760
If you're making eye contact,

02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:42.800
people are gonna think you're keeping up with it

02:31:42.800 --> 02:31:44.760
and you don't want to,

02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:46.360
because you wanna focus on other things

02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:50.240
and make progress in other dimensions.

02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:52.840
Yeah, and so then there's a strong desire to look away

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:56.960
or to close the eyes because it's overwhelming,

02:31:56.960 --> 02:31:58.880
it's a distraction and it's gonna cause

02:31:58.880 --> 02:32:00.240
errors of understanding.

02:32:00.240 --> 02:32:02.000
And of course, our eyes, that's part,

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.520
the way we use our eyes is part of the human communication

02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:07.520
so it can be aware of that element of it.

02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:12.160
So yeah, I mean, but it's fascinating.

02:32:12.160 --> 02:32:13.920
You should be aware of your own self

02:32:13.920 --> 02:32:16.200
and those little characteristics,

02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:19.600
whether it's classified on some aspect

02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:22.800
of the autism spectrum or just in general.

02:32:23.760 --> 02:32:26.240
Whether it's eating, whether it's depression,

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:29.760
whether it's even like schizophrenia that would,

02:32:29.760 --> 02:32:33.000
I hope we get a chance to talk to a little bit.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.480
Yeah, but those things are all made up

02:32:35.480 --> 02:32:40.120
of different symptoms and characteristics

02:32:40.120 --> 02:32:43.440
and use them as a superpower, I suppose,

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:47.960
is the best we can hope for in mild cases, I guess.

02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.560
I do think both brain states

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.040
can't coexist at the same time.

02:32:51.040 --> 02:32:52.880
The way of dealing with something unpredictable

02:32:52.880 --> 02:32:55.200
and dealing with something predictable,

02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.560
those are different ways of being,

02:32:56.560 --> 02:33:01.560
here's a huge opportunity for very creative model building

02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:06.080
in theoretical neuroscience and linking that to

02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:09.480
these data streams we're getting across the brain

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:11.040
that we talked about earlier,

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:13.680
these immense data sets of activity across the brain.

02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:18.280
Here's where I think there could be a real convergence

02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:20.200
of theoreticians and experimentalists to say,

02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:23.080
okay, given what we know about wiring of the brain,

02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.920
here is what the brain state is likely to be

02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:30.960
that deals well with unpredictable information.

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:31.880
And here's the brain state

02:33:31.880 --> 02:33:33.920
that deals with predictable information.

02:33:33.920 --> 02:33:36.600
Here's why they're incompatible at least at the same time.

02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:39.120
Here's why you've got to be able to detect

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:40.200
which state you should be in.

02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:42.200
Here's how you could switch between them.

02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:44.720
Here's the kind of cells that you would predict

02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:46.560
almost like predicting the Higgs boson.

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:49.560
Here's the kind of circuitry that I would predict

02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:51.880
should govern the switching

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:55.400
or might make one state too sticky,

02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:57.800
too hard to get out of, right?

02:33:57.800 --> 02:33:58.640
Yeah.

02:33:58.640 --> 02:34:01.160
That is a huge opportunity for an interaction

02:34:01.160 --> 02:34:05.160
from the theoretical and experimental side together.

02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:07.960
Make one state too sticky.

02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:12.680
The sort of measure the stickiness of the state

02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:14.520
and how to lessen the stickiness.

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:15.360
That's right.

02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:16.560
Get some oil in the machine.

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:17.400
Yes.

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:20.440
What would predict the kind of oil that would work well.

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:26.920
What in your practice is treatment or advice

02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:31.360
for people on the autism spectrum?

02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:34.480
So right now there's no real medical treatment.

02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:36.600
There are behavioral treatments

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.880
that are most effective early in life.

02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:42.160
They make sure people don't fall too far behind.

02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:43.760
If you're not interacting socially,

02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:46.880
you create this vicious cycle

02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.600
where you fall farther and farther behind

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:49.720
because you're not interacting.

02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:52.680
And these therapies which are applied early in life,

02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:54.400
therapists work with the kids,

02:34:55.880 --> 02:34:57.840
train them to deal with these things

02:34:57.840 --> 02:34:59.840
that otherwise would be aversive to them,

02:34:59.840 --> 02:35:02.640
teach them how to predict things and interact.

02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:06.840
And that has a big effect, but it's behavioral therapy.

02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:08.800
There's no medicine that works.

02:35:08.800 --> 02:35:12.040
There are ways of reducing individual symptoms though

02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:14.000
that sometimes come along with autism

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:15.720
and those do respond to medications.

02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:18.680
So you can, you know, one thing very often

02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:21.400
my patients with autism are very anxious

02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:23.840
because they live in a world

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:25.520
that they have a really hard time

02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:26.560
predicting what's gonna happen.

02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:29.200
And so they find, and some of these are high functioning,

02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:31.520
you know, Silicon Valley types who, you know,

02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:33.880
they may make, you know, great livings,

02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:37.240
but they're very unhappy because they're on the spectrum.

02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:43.200
They don't understand how social interactions really work.

02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.200
They're very anxiety provoking

02:35:46.200 --> 02:35:47.240
because they don't know what to say.

02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:48.360
They don't have any clue

02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.920
how anybody else knows what to say.

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:52.760
They're constantly worried they're gonna say something

02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:54.560
that's completely inappropriate.

02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:55.600
And so they're very anxious.

02:35:55.600 --> 02:35:57.440
And I can treat their anxiety.

02:35:57.440 --> 02:35:59.680
It doesn't touch the autism per se,

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:02.480
but I can help them with their anxiety.

02:36:02.480 --> 02:36:04.320
What I just talked about, eye contact.

02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:08.240
I am richly, you know, with eyes closed

02:36:08.240 --> 02:36:09.320
and all those kinds of things,

02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.240
I'm richly experiencing the world.

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:14.440
And it's not like you're afraid of the world

02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:16.120
or you're not able, I don't know what to do.

02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:17.480
No, I know everything.

02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:19.160
In fact, I know way too much.

02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:20.880
There's so many cool options.

02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:24.600
Like at any one moment, there's all this stuff happening

02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:26.240
and it's all beautiful.

02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:28.680
And at any one moment, you can do anything you want.

02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:29.840
You can take off your clothes.

02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:31.760
You can punch that guy over there.

02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:33.880
You can run away.

02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:35.880
You can go in for a hug.

02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:38.400
You can say something profound and deep,

02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.040
or you can say something generic,

02:36:40.040 --> 02:36:42.280
or you can do so many things you can say.

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:46.400
And then it'll go, it'll unravel in all these kinds of ways

02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:48.960
and this moment could be completely life-changing

02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:51.360
or it can be mundane and meaningless.

02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:54.560
And all of those options are before you at any one moment.

02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:59.840
And so it's like, it's amazing and overwhelming

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:02.120
if you allow yourself to think about it,

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:04.720
which, whatever, exactly.

02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:06.360
Like, well, unfortunately with chess,

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:08.520
you have a few set options.

02:37:08.520 --> 02:37:09.360
Two-dimensional space.

02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:11.920
Two-dimensional as constraints.

02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:15.160
There is unlimited possibilities

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:18.480
and unlimited beautiful things happening all around you.

02:37:18.480 --> 02:37:20.560
So I don't think there's a kind of sense

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.560
that somehow you're limited in the places of,

02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:29.880
in the way you can see the world

02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:31.880
and how you can interact with that world.

02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:35.360
I am overwhelmed by the lack of limit

02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.600
that all of us should be,

02:37:37.600 --> 02:37:38.560
have you looked around,

02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:40.240
you can do whatever the hell you want.

02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:42.240
Nobody will remember you anyway.

02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:44.120
All of us will be dead one day.

02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:45.840
You could do anything.

02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:48.680
You can, I don't know.

02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:50.960
You can get naked and run around the city

02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:52.720
as long as you're not hurting anybody

02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:54.600
and it doesn't matter.

02:37:54.600 --> 02:37:55.440
So.

02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:56.280
Austin anyway.

02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:57.120
Austin, yeah.

02:37:58.240 --> 02:37:59.080
Exactly.

02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:01.840
Seems like a to-do item

02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:04.600
for anybody living in Austin for sure.

02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:07.240
But you know, the spectrum is an interesting concept

02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:10.480
because that is, you know, when I say,

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.480
when I refer to the spectrum,

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:15.360
I'm actually referring to it's a precise clinical term

02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:17.920
but you're right, it's been co-opted more broadly

02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:19.160
and it is widely used

02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:22.160
and it can be an unfair categorization

02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:25.920
of someone who's socially and occupationally very healthy.

02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:28.200
And that is critical

02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:32.320
because we don't define a disorder

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:34.800
unless there's social or occupational dysfunction.

02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.840
It doesn't matter what the symptoms are.

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:39.760
I've had patients who are pleasantly hallucinating.

02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:43.160
So frankly, psychotic, but doesn't affect their lives.

02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:46.400
So I don't give that person as diagnosis

02:38:46.400 --> 02:38:49.960
because there's not social or occupational dysfunction.

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.640
Same with anything on this, you know,

02:38:53.640 --> 02:38:57.320
any of the diverse symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:00.000
If someone has them,

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.120
but they're successful socially and occupationally,

02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:05.640
we don't say that there's a disorder.

02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:06.480
But then you're right,

02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:09.720
that the concept of the spectrum does become a useful,

02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:12.720
you know, pigeonholing device,

02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:14.840
which is maybe not the best thing.

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:20.000
Yeah, and the eye contact is interesting one,

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.200
is interesting one.

02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:22.280
I'm torn on it.

02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:25.920
I'm torn about the usefulness of eye contact

02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:27.440
because people kind of make fun of it,

02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:31.640
but let me just say one thing about eye contact

02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:33.200
and about life in general.

02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:34.720
It's okay to be weird.

02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:39.440
But like some people, when you have your eyes closed

02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:40.280
and there's that weird,

02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:41.800
what is happening to this creature?

02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:44.880
Like you see a weird creature on the side of the road.

02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:46.400
It's interesting.

02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:49.160
And you wanna, I mean, the weird stuff,

02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:51.600
I'm gonna go back to Robin Williams with the,

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:53.840
that's the good stuff, right?

02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:56.400
He has that whole speech about him and his wife

02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:59.320
and what he loves all the little peculiarities,

02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:00.200
all the weird stuff.

02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:04.280
And that like, let those flourish.

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:06.440
Celebrate those in yourself.

02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:08.600
And not in some kind of woke way,

02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:10.960
but in some very human way.

02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:13.080
This is what makes us, is the weirdness.

02:40:13.080 --> 02:40:16.720
Yeah, I'm 100% on board with that.

02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:21.720
And I don't think people who are happy

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:27.120
and who have people in their lives who are happy with them,

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.440
these are, I think, let the weirdness flourish.

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:34.240
Let all the different ways members of the human family

02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:35.200
can be different.

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:36.120
Let's see them all.

02:40:36.120 --> 02:40:38.800
That's one of the joys of being alive

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:41.120
is seeing all the ways we can be human.

02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:43.920
And I think about it all the time.

02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:48.040
Why do we have all these ways of being human?

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:52.960
And even within one individual,

02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:54.200
you go through phases of life

02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:57.120
where you express different sides of your way of being,

02:40:57.120 --> 02:40:59.240
which is also a pretty fun opportunity, right?

02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.840
You can go through phases where you're in one mode

02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.280
and phases when you're in another mode.

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:09.720
And let that flourish too.

02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:13.360
Let the ways that you can be you vary as well.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:15.720
I think that's important for people to explore.

02:41:15.720 --> 02:41:19.720
And I should, Mike, as if you can address the internet,

02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:25.320
but I would like to sort of ask the internet

02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.440
to celebrate the weirdness of people.

02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:35.680
That's, it's the Robin Williams,

02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:39.800
people call these imperfections, but they're not.

02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:40.800
That's the good stuff.

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:43.000
For any one individual person,

02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:47.680
find the weird stuff and celebrate it

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:50.480
as opposed to what the internet often does,

02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:55.000
which is find the weird stuff and criticize it.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.600
Because when you criticize the weird stuff,

02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:01.760
you're creating conformity, which is another human thing,

02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:06.760
but that conformity creates a boring world.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:10.800
You want the weird, you want the crazy.

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:12.360
That's what fun is made of.

02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:16.280
That's the foundation of humor

02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:19.040
and all the ways in which we deal

02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:21.680
with the suffering in the world,

02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:23.560
with the injustices in the world,

02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:28.320
is this huge variety of weird.

02:42:30.920 --> 02:42:32.640
Yeah, I don't know.

02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.000
And that's what, at the depth of psychiatry,

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:38.760
is you wanna acknowledge the weird,

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:41.880
celebrate the weird, step around it

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.960
to find the particular aspects of weird

02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:47.280
that are debilitating, like you said.

02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:49.640
They're somehow negatively affecting your ability

02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:51.080
to function in the world,

02:42:51.080 --> 02:42:54.680
as opposed to trying to shut it all down.

02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.520
That's right.

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.440
Well, on that topic,

02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:00.680
I'd love to talk to you about schizophrenia.

02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:04.920
What is schizophrenia?

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.480
From your research and from your general understanding,

02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:10.680
and what is the full landscape of suffering

02:43:10.680 --> 02:43:15.000
and wisdom that schizophrenia explores?

02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:20.320
Schizophrenia is a state where there is a break

02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:23.320
from reality, and so this can show up

02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:27.680
as we call them the positive symptoms of schizophrenia.

02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:30.560
These include hallucinations, hearing something

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.040
or seeing something that's not there,

02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:34.680
usually auditory hallucinations.

02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:38.480
Paranoia, people can have complex fears.

02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:41.200
Delusions, which we call fixed false beliefs.

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:43.400
People get an extremely unshakable

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:46.600
but completely implausible idea about something.

02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:49.880
Sometimes it relates to themself, sometimes to the world.

02:43:49.880 --> 02:43:51.520
These we call the positive symptoms,

02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:53.240
break from reality as we know it.

02:43:54.640 --> 02:43:57.000
Then there are the negative symptoms that come with it,

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.840
and these are progressive.

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.480
These are flattening of emotion, as we call it.

02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:07.560
So starting to express less and less positive emotion,

02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:12.080
ending more in a neutral or flat state.

02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:15.120
Thought disorder, inability to work

02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:18.120
with complex patterns of planning or thinking.

02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:19.600
So you can't make plans.

02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:21.240
You'd have poor working memory.

02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:25.440
You can't keep track of where you were in a conversation,

02:44:25.440 --> 02:44:26.960
in a sequence of actions.

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:32.880
So poor and impaired, working with the thoughts of oneself,

02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:38.040
and then these positive symptoms of break from reality.

02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:41.120
Okay, now why do these come together?

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:44.120
What's the neurobiology of it?

02:44:44.120 --> 02:44:45.440
Again, we don't know.

02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:48.040
Schizophrenia, extremely genetically determined.

02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:48.880
If you look at the numbers,

02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:51.960
could be upwards of 80% genetically determined.

02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:57.280
1% of the human population around the world,

02:44:57.280 --> 02:44:58.840
it's universal, okay?

02:44:58.840 --> 02:45:00.880
It's not confined to any one culture,

02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:04.640
not even really biased in one culture or another,

02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.200
about 1% around the world.

02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:12.360
And has this progressive quality to it, untreated.

02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:13.560
So it's very interesting.

02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.080
There's a break that happens.

02:45:15.080 --> 02:45:17.040
We call it first break.

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:22.040
When someone experiences their first disruption of reality,

02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:25.160
they can have a completely typical life up until that point.

02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:27.160
So you might have a, and I've seen,

02:45:27.160 --> 02:45:29.520
just heartbreaking cases of like this

02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.560
in the Stanford emergency room,

02:45:31.560 --> 02:45:33.160
where a kid who's come there,

02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:37.000
has been extremely high functioning

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.160
in that sense of academic achievement,

02:45:39.160 --> 02:45:41.720
and athletic, and interpersonal,

02:45:41.720 --> 02:45:43.360
and then comes to college.

02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:46.880
Usually in men, it's around 18, 19,

02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:48.320
when the first break happens.

02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:52.520
Some terrifying paranoia hits,

02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:55.280
or some auditory hallucinations start.

02:45:55.280 --> 02:45:57.760
They're getting screamed at by a voice in their head.

02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.520
So devastating.

02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.800
With women, comes on also often a little later,

02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:06.120
sometimes in the 20s, and it can be progressive.

02:46:06.120 --> 02:46:09.640
If it's not treated, it just progresses and progresses.

02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:12.920
The voices become overwhelming.

02:46:13.480 --> 02:46:16.760
The delusions and paranoia extend and expand.

02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:18.400
The thought, the negative symptoms particularly,

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:20.400
become more and more severe.

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:23.160
So one can't even maintain thoughts

02:46:23.160 --> 02:46:24.880
in any sort of ordered fashion.

02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:30.080
And then eventually, it can be fatal.

02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:31.480
It can lead to suicide.

02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:35.520
It can lead to erratic behavior that leads to accidents.

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:38.920
Now, it can be treated.

02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:42.280
There are medications that help, fortunately.

02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:44.120
They have side effects, so they're not perfect.

02:46:44.120 --> 02:46:46.360
You can have movement problems,

02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.560
and actually a whole host of different side effects

02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:51.680
that come from the medications.

02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:55.240
But we can help people now with schizophrenia

02:46:55.240 --> 02:46:56.640
very, very significantly.

02:46:58.120 --> 02:46:59.440
But the amazing thing,

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:02.400
and this is emblematic of where psychiatry stands,

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.520
we don't have the deep understanding.

02:47:04.520 --> 02:47:05.840
Just like with depression,

02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:09.680
we don't have that heart as a pump level of understanding

02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:11.520
that we'd like to have with schizophrenia,

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:15.440
despite it being so biological, so genetic in its nature.

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:20.000
So is there a way to return

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.440
to the other side of the first break?

02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:24.120
So when you have a break with reality,

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:26.960
is there a way to kind of stitch it together?

02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:29.560
Yeah, so some people, that works.

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:32.400
But we don't really know how.

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:36.160
So medications, anti-psychotic medications, we call them,

02:47:36.160 --> 02:47:39.280
they block a particular neurotransmitter receptor

02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:44.280
called the serotonin 2A receptor.

02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:46.480
And they modulate dopamine as well

02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:48.320
and other neurotransmitters.

02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:53.760
These can take someone who's actively hallucinating,

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:57.200
actively paranoid, put them back in a completely normal state,

02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:01.280
and some people stay that way indefinitely.

02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.240
And so you can bring people back from that,

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:07.240
back to the other side, have it stitched together.

02:48:07.240 --> 02:48:11.920
More typically, you'll end up in some intermediate state

02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:15.440
where symptoms are reduced powerfully,

02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:16.960
but there might be still something there

02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:19.480
and you've got a drop down in functioning

02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:22.000
that may be persistent for a while.

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.080
But concepts, what physically is going on?

02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:31.080
One idea is that it's communication within the brain.

02:48:31.680 --> 02:48:35.240
One part of the brain is not able to tell other parts

02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:36.400
of the brain what it's doing.

02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:38.000
And so the auditory hallucinations

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.240
are very interesting in this regard.

02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:42.080
They often have this conversational

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:44.280
inner monologue quality.

02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:45.440
As we're walking along the street,

02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:47.600
we may have an inner monologue thoughts

02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:49.200
about what's going on.

02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:50.680
If we see somebody we don't like,

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:52.080
we may have a thought out,

02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.160
wish somebody would punch that guy, something like that,

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:55.320
or maybe I should punch that guy.

02:48:55.320 --> 02:48:59.960
But these are so far below where we would ever act

02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:02.360
or even think of acting,

02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:04.440
but they're just things that come up.

02:49:04.440 --> 02:49:06.040
And in people with schizophrenia,

02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:09.960
those inner thoughts, that inner monologue

02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:14.960
is not recognized as the inner monologue of the self.

02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:20.240
And so it's perceived as something coming from the outside

02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:23.400
or from inside, but from another entity.

02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:25.120
Another, oh, another entity.

02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:27.800
I thought you meant like another room

02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:29.280
inside the same building.

02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:31.040
Another room inside there, yeah.

02:49:31.040 --> 02:49:31.880
Yeah.

02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:35.320
And so it could be conceptualized

02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:38.360
as a communication within the brain problem,

02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.920
notifying another part of the brain, what's going on.

02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:43.440
And there's some evidence consistent with that.

02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:45.800
I don't know if you can help with this,

02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:48.360
but I sometimes, so I've been talking

02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.320
to quite a few homeless folks recently,

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:54.160
just what I do is I hang out at night

02:49:56.120 --> 02:49:59.840
and talk to interesting people.

02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:02.560
And some of them, and I've known people in the past

02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:03.920
who suffer from schizophrenia,

02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:07.040
and some of them like self will describe

02:50:07.920 --> 02:50:11.360
as that as something they suffer from.

02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:14.400
And they seem to understand something deeply

02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:15.880
about this world.

02:50:15.880 --> 02:50:20.880
I don't know if it's correlated or maybe it's,

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:23.440
it's another aspect of like depression,

02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:27.720
all those things that I've encountered in my own life

02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:31.600
is maybe just the struggle and the suffering

02:50:31.600 --> 02:50:33.160
has taken you through a life

02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:35.280
where you think deeply about life.

02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:37.520
Like there's like self-reflection

02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:39.560
that society forces on you

02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:43.320
because it's a disorder of some kind.

02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:46.040
It's interesting, I guess my only

02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:47.480
sort of anecdotal observation

02:50:47.480 --> 02:50:49.720
is people who suffer from schizophrenia

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:55.920
seem to be very interesting and very thoughtful

02:50:56.120 --> 02:50:58.360
in a nonlinear way about the world.

02:51:00.120 --> 02:51:03.000
I've noticed that it's not always positive.

02:51:04.080 --> 02:51:06.560
There are the unusual ways they view the world.

02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:10.040
It was, but it's always interesting.

02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:12.480
That could be conspiratorial thinking too.

02:51:12.480 --> 02:51:13.320
Yeah.

02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:15.040
Like, but like the theories they have

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:17.120
about the way the world functions,

02:51:17.120 --> 02:51:20.480
often very well read, which is also interesting

02:51:20.480 --> 02:51:21.640
because they're almost like looking

02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:23.680
for helpful answers from somewhere.

02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:24.520
Absolutely there.

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:26.480
And so there might be citing

02:51:26.480 --> 02:51:29.160
some very interesting literature and then using that

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:33.480
to, there's a stickiness in their mind

02:51:33.480 --> 02:51:34.840
to different models of the world

02:51:34.840 --> 02:51:36.680
and trying to make sense of that world.

02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:39.120
And those models could include conspiracy theories.

02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.200
Yeah.

02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:42.440
They're very attuned to complexity

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:45.000
and they come up with unlikely explanations,

02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:48.480
which is one of the things that makes them,

02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:50.800
it makes it hard for them to function in the world

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:53.040
is how unlikely their explanations are.

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:53.880
But you're right.

02:51:53.880 --> 02:51:55.800
There's a depth of consideration

02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:59.520
of the complexity of the world and a concern about it

02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:04.640
and a work, an impulse to work to understand it

02:52:04.640 --> 02:52:07.080
that is actually quite refreshing.

02:52:07.080 --> 02:52:11.120
But the first case in the medical literature,

02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:15.280
there was a classical schizophrenia.

02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:17.880
There was a patient named James Tilly Matthews

02:52:17.880 --> 02:52:22.400
who had this, he sketched out for his doctor

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:26.600
the experiences he was sensing.

02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:31.600
And he drew himself as a cowering figure on the ground

02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:35.560
controlled by a loom, a weaving device

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:39.720
that was sending threads, long threads, projections

02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:42.960
across space from the loom to him, to his arms

02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:46.800
and to his body and controlling him from afar.

02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:51.760
And he called this the heirloom, a loom in the heir.

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:54.240
And it was such an evocative thing

02:52:54.240 --> 02:52:56.680
because this was the start of the industrial revolution

02:52:56.680 --> 02:53:01.320
or mid, and it was where really industrial strength,

02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:05.880
looms and weaving devices were really kind of the emblematic

02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:10.320
of the most complex, powerful technological achievements

02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:11.160
of the time.

02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:14.120
And so that was the explanation available to him

02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:18.080
to explain how his body was seemingly moved

02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:19.400
without his volition.

02:53:20.240 --> 02:53:22.920
And these days, of course, people with schizophrenia

02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:26.360
will have more technology appropriate interpretations.

02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:29.760
They'll have a, you know, delusions of satellite

02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:32.920
or alien control or beamed information,

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:35.080
very, very common to have this delusion

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:39.640
of a government agency, you know, sending electromagnetic

02:53:39.640 --> 02:53:43.400
or radio frequency information to control their limbs.

02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:45.800
But it's the same thing, it's that whether it's a thread

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:48.320
from an industrial revolution loom

02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:51.920
or, you know, RF, you know, radiation,

02:53:51.920 --> 02:53:55.400
it's the same thing just adapted to the moment explaining,

02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:57.240
trying to explain the world they live in

02:53:57.240 --> 02:53:58.560
and their relationship to the world.

02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:01.200
But unconstrained by sort of the thing

02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:04.440
that's socially acceptable, which is both refreshing

02:54:04.440 --> 02:54:05.280
and dangerous.

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:06.120
Yes.

02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:10.880
I wrote down a question.

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:12.000
Why do we cry?

02:54:13.240 --> 02:54:15.200
Are tears a window to some depths

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:17.520
that we ourselves don't know?

02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:19.600
I almost want to make fun of myself for that question,

02:54:19.600 --> 02:54:22.600
but you do talk seriously about crying in the book.

02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:26.280
In fact, the whole first chapter really, really tussles

02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:28.680
with crying as a, as why do we do it?

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:29.520
What does it mean?

02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:31.000
Why is it involuntary?

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:32.320
It seems like a weakness, right?

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.240
It's because it's so involuntary

02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:36.640
and it's reflecting something true and inside

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:39.160
at the level of the individual,

02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:40.480
that seems like a problem, right?

02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:42.600
Wouldn't it be better if we could control it?

02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:46.960
If we could not show that emotion

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:49.520
when it's not useful, show it when it's useful,

02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:51.840
but it's not, it's largely involuntary.

02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:55.560
And so there's a value to it, I think,

02:54:55.560 --> 02:54:58.720
as an honest reporter of a need,

02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:03.560
of hope and frailty at the same time.

02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:05.040
I am a human being.

02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:11.080
There's a frail, a frailty to myself or my situation

02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:14.720
where I need social help, I need help from my community.

02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:16.800
I have hope that that is possible,

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.720
but I'm not enough for myself.

02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:21.560
I need the community.

02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:25.440
That I think is what the social signal of crying is.

02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:27.040
Now, people have studied crying.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:31.880
It's an extreme, you can quantify the extent

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:34.880
to which the presence of tears on a face

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:37.960
triggers reactions in onlookers.

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:40.440
And you can show the same face

02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:42.480
in the presence or absence of tears

02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:45.560
and show that to people under quantifiable

02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:49.400
and rigorous psychological conditions.

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:52.280
And tears are much more powerful

02:55:52.280 --> 02:55:57.080
at stirring the desire to help in viewers

02:55:57.080 --> 02:56:01.160
than any other facial feature,

02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:04.040
which is pretty interesting that it's the honest one

02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:05.680
that's also the most powerful, right?

02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:07.760
It kind of indicates there's a certain logic

02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:11.280
to our design as social beings

02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:13.720
that we have an honest report.

02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:17.200
That's hard to control.

02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:21.560
But is it well understood how that connects

02:56:21.560 --> 02:56:26.400
to the internal state of emotion?

02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:30.520
Yeah, there are long range projections that come.

02:56:30.520 --> 02:56:31.880
So where is crying generated?

02:56:31.880 --> 02:56:33.240
This is the confusing thing about it.

02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:36.640
So that we have a little tear duct, the lacrimal gland

02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:38.120
that leads to the release of fluid,

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:40.400
it ejects fluid and it comes out.

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:43.520
And those of course, that whole system was designed

02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.120
to keep the eye clean, to wash out particulate irritants.

02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:49.840
So it's a long standing, as long as we've had eyes

02:56:49.840 --> 02:56:52.920
and have been out of the water in our evolution,

02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.000
we've needed this sort of thing.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.200
So long standing biological structure

02:56:56.200 --> 02:57:00.040
recently co-opted it seems by our evolution

02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:02.120
as social primates.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:03.960
Now, how could that happen?

02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:07.640
Well, the lacrimal gland is controlled by structures

02:57:07.640 --> 02:57:10.360
in the pons, which is a structure deep in our,

02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:14.160
just above our neck, between our neck and our head

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.840
and reflecting its ancient origin, right?

02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:18.640
As you go farther down toward the spinal cord,

02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:21.880
these are the more basic, early evolved structures.

02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:25.320
And in the pons, that's where breathing is controlled,

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.520
tear duct contraction.

02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:34.080
And what we found and with optogenetics,

02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:35.440
we helped sort this out.

02:57:35.440 --> 02:57:37.640
There are long range projections from fear

02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:41.040
and anxiety regions in the forebrain

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:43.440
that project all the way to the pons

02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:45.440
in and around those areas.

02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:49.160
The reason those are there, we think is to regulate

02:57:49.160 --> 02:57:50.800
the respiratory rate changes,

02:57:50.800 --> 02:57:53.040
the breathing changes of fear and anxiety.

02:57:53.040 --> 02:57:55.800
So we know when we're in a state of fear and anxiety,

02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:58.880
we need, we cope better if we have elevated heart rate,

02:57:58.880 --> 02:58:01.520
elevated respiratory rate, more blood pumping around,

02:58:01.520 --> 02:58:03.720
more oxygenated blood, we're ready to meet the threat

02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:05.080
if it happens.

02:58:05.080 --> 02:58:07.520
All those cells are down there in the pons too,

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:12.520
right next to the lacrimal duct, the tear gland neurons.

02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:17.520
And so almost certainly this fear anxiety induced crying

02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:23.000
arose from a very slightly misdirected long range

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:27.520
projection that was there to regulate breathing

02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:29.800
and a little twist, just a little misdirection,

02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:33.640
a little missing of one sign post to stop here

02:58:33.640 --> 02:58:35.360
and going on a little farther,

02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:38.960
getting to the lacrimal gland neurons gave us crying.

02:58:38.960 --> 02:58:40.440
And that's, and we just have it,

02:58:40.440 --> 02:58:42.840
that peculiar sort of structure,

02:58:42.840 --> 02:58:44.640
neuronal structure that resulted in that,

02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:46.720
that's what we're stuck with.

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:50.040
And then, and ends up being, in terms of social interaction,

02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:55.040
one of the more important authentic involuntary displays

02:58:55.880 --> 02:58:58.920
of interstate and social communication.

02:58:59.280 --> 02:59:02.400
Oh, yeah.

02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.000
Is there other stuff like that?

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:07.400
I mean, do you, yeah, I mean, the human face

02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:09.680
is fascinating as a display of emotion,

02:59:09.680 --> 02:59:12.280
as a display of truth and lying

02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:13.880
and all those kinds of things.

02:59:13.880 --> 02:59:18.880
I personally, I mean, we're all, I suppose,

02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:24.160
have different sensors that are sensitive

02:59:24.160 --> 02:59:25.760
to certain aspects of the human face,

02:59:25.760 --> 02:59:28.360
but to me, it seems like the eyes

02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:31.480
are really important communication of something.

02:59:31.480 --> 02:59:35.320
I've talked to a few girls about Botox and stuff like that,

02:59:35.320 --> 02:59:37.600
and it always bothers me when,

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:38.800
I guess guys can do this too,

02:59:38.800 --> 02:59:43.800
but when women speak negatively of,

02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:46.320
I guess you can call them wrinkles

02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:49.760
at the tips of an eye,

02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:54.760
but to me, when you smile, when you not wink,

02:59:55.200 --> 02:59:59.400
but narrow the eyes, something is communicated,

02:59:59.400 --> 03:00:03.160
and that stuff is really useful, the human face,

03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:05.520
and when it's gone, something is missing.

03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:08.600
And a lot of little stuff, it feels like can really,

03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:10.720
it's almost involuntary, I guess,

03:00:10.720 --> 03:00:12.120
but it's harder to describe

03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:13.920
as the presence or absence of tears.

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:16.640
It's like something about this person,

03:00:16.640 --> 03:00:18.880
you can tell they're not bullshitting you.

03:00:18.880 --> 03:00:21.960
Yeah, and so that was what made, presumably,

03:00:22.520 --> 03:00:24.880
that tear recruitment so powerful,

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:28.440
is it just landed in this very high-value real estate

03:00:28.440 --> 03:00:29.800
for social communication.

03:00:29.800 --> 03:00:34.000
If it had gone to, there's a lot of neurons in the pons

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:39.000
that control movement of large muscles elsewhere,

03:00:40.200 --> 03:00:42.480
that would have been much less effective as a social signal

03:00:42.480 --> 03:00:43.440
than something around the eye,

03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:46.800
so it was, however that little misdirection happened,

03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:50.440
it landed in a great area for social communication,

03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:53.440
and because it was coming from the fear and anxiety circuits

03:00:53.440 --> 03:00:57.040
that regulate that necessary involuntary change

03:00:57.040 --> 03:00:59.680
in heart rate and respiratory rate,

03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:02.480
it also was involuntary, and that became valuable

03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:05.920
as a truth signal, as social beings.

03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:08.520
So very interesting when you think about

03:01:08.520 --> 03:01:09.720
the origins of the human family,

03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:14.200
the origins of social structures and our ability and need

03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:16.280
to call for help when there's hope,

03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:18.120
but need at the same time.

03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:23.080
What is consciousness, Carl?

03:01:23.080 --> 03:01:26.560
So you're actually using techniques,

03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:28.360
I mean, even putting psychiatry aside,

03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:31.760
just looking at optogenetics,

03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:34.440
you're trying to understand some of these deep aspects

03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:37.200
of the human mind, and maybe this is a good time

03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:39.440
to return to a question you mentioned

03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:41.200
you might have an opinion on,

03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:43.320
if there's such a thing as a theory of everything

03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:46.640
for the human mind, because surely answering

03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:51.000
of what is consciousness is as, well, that's not sure,

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.560
but it seems like it's a fundamental part

03:01:53.560 --> 03:01:56.240
of the human experience and the human mind,

03:01:56.240 --> 03:02:00.760
and solving that question will result in solving

03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:02.680
the bigger thing about the human mind.

03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:05.080
The flip side could be consciousness,

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:07.760
it's just a few neurons that are generating

03:02:07.760 --> 03:02:10.120
some useful thing that make us,

03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:14.280
it's like the sense of self that you talked about

03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:18.680
in the mice, maybe it's a subset of those cells

03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:21.160
that are just creating a richer sense of self,

03:02:21.160 --> 03:02:22.000
and that's it.

03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:26.320
So this is a great question,

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:28.160
all neuroscientists think about this,

03:02:28.160 --> 03:02:29.920
and a lot of non-neuroscientists too,

03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:32.960
it's such a, it's the reason a lot of people

03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:34.600
came to the study of the brain

03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:36.160
is to think about consciousness,

03:02:36.160 --> 03:02:38.440
and not just being awake or alert,

03:02:38.440 --> 03:02:40.560
but really what's sometimes called

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.320
the hard problem of consciousness,

03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:45.000
which is what is that nature

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.880
of that inner subjective sense we have,

03:02:47.880 --> 03:02:50.240
not just information processing,

03:02:51.880 --> 03:02:55.080
but feeling something about the information,

03:02:55.080 --> 03:02:59.200
what is that inner state of subjectivity physically?

03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:00.040
What is it?

03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:03.400
And that's called the hard problem of consciousness,

03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:08.400
and it's not a extremely well-defined question,

03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:11.440
everybody has sort of a sense of what it means,

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:14.320
but it's such a hard problem

03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:17.240
because you run into paradoxes quite quickly

03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:18.560
the more you think about it,

03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:21.920
and that is exciting also,

03:03:21.920 --> 03:03:23.440
because it makes us think,

03:03:23.440 --> 03:03:25.200
actually there's some fundamental,

03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:28.240
there's a big thing that we're missing,

03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:31.000
the brain is not just a collection of little tricks,

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.880
there is a big, big concept.

03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:34.080
So that's your sense of the big,

03:03:34.080 --> 03:03:37.680
because like a flip side could be with optogenetics,

03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:40.400
you can, there's an engineering question,

03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:43.040
can you turn consciousness on and off,

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:43.920
like a light switch?

03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:47.200
Okay, so here's where exactly consciousness

03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:48.960
frames the problem extremely well,

03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:50.600
and it frames it the following way.

03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:55.600
So I told you earlier that we can stimulate 20 or 25 cells

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.640
in the visual cortex of a mouse,

03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:01.800
and we can make it behave,

03:04:01.800 --> 03:04:03.520
and we can make its brain act

03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:06.040
as if it's seeing something that isn't there.

03:04:06.040 --> 03:04:07.240
We have that level of control now,

03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:09.480
we can pick out 25 neurons,

03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:13.080
play an activity in both behavior and in the brain,

03:04:13.080 --> 03:04:16.120
it's as if it's seeing something specific.

03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:18.600
Okay, now let's do a thought experiment,

03:04:18.600 --> 03:04:20.600
you know, a Gdankin experiment,

03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:21.840
and let's play this out,

03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.360
let's say we could do the same thing

03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:27.880
for every single neuron in the brain of a human being.

03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:30.120
Let's say we had total control,

03:04:30.120 --> 03:04:31.520
and I could do something like,

03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:34.800
I could show you a rich deep color red,

03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:35.720
and you could look at it,

03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:36.960
and you would be aware that it's red,

03:04:36.960 --> 03:04:39.280
but also you might have some feelings about it,

03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:40.320
something would be stirred in you,

03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:43.480
some subjective sense as you looked at that rich color red.

03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:48.880
And then I would take away the visual stimulus,

03:04:48.880 --> 03:04:50.320
and I would, in this thought experiment,

03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:53.280
I would, using some hyperoptogenetics,

03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:57.000
I would play in exactly the same pattern of activity

03:04:57.000 --> 03:05:00.360
in every cell in your brain for as long as was needed,

03:05:00.360 --> 03:05:03.360
whatever, 15 seconds, something like that,

03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:06.880
that exactly matched what was going on

03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:10.360
when you were feeling that inner subjective sense.

03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:12.200
Okay, so in that thought experiment,

03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:13.560
a question for you is,

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:18.120
would you be feeling that same inner subjective sense?

03:05:18.120 --> 03:05:20.600
Stimulus is gone, every neuron's doing the same thing

03:05:20.600 --> 03:05:21.960
because I'm controlling it.

03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:25.840
There's a philosophical question there,

03:05:25.840 --> 03:05:29.400
if you ask me specifically, I would say yes.

03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:31.440
Okay, good, most people would say that

03:05:31.440 --> 03:05:33.760
because it's hard to say no, right?

03:05:33.760 --> 03:05:34.880
It's very hard to say no.

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.240
Every cell in your brain is doing what it was doing,

03:05:38.240 --> 03:05:39.560
what else could be different?

03:05:39.560 --> 03:05:40.400
How could-

03:05:40.400 --> 03:05:42.720
Well, most normal people would say yes.

03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:46.320
Of course, philosophers would then start saying no.

03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:48.240
They're the ones that say,

03:05:50.440 --> 03:05:52.640
I'm in sort of, to parallel,

03:05:52.640 --> 03:05:54.240
and sorry if it's a bit of an interruption,

03:05:54.240 --> 03:05:57.600
but if there's a robot that's conscious in front of you,

03:05:58.440 --> 03:06:02.880
if it appears conscious, then it's conscious.

03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:07.280
Like to me, of course, philosophers again speak up

03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:10.040
and say, well, no, how do you know it's conscious?

03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:12.360
Well, how do you know anything is conscious?

03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:15.440
And sort of as normal humans,

03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:19.160
we tend to lean on the experience

03:06:19.160 --> 03:06:22.640
versus some kind of philosophical concept.

03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:25.320
So the great thing about what you just said,

03:06:25.320 --> 03:06:28.400
the Turing test is it's very practical.

03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:31.000
If it acts conscious, it is conscious.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:32.880
But I think that's limiting.

03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:34.760
I like the thought experiment.

03:06:34.760 --> 03:06:36.240
I think it's actually more informative.

03:06:36.240 --> 03:06:39.760
And so I'm halfway to the conclusion there,

03:06:39.760 --> 03:06:43.240
but let's take it as your answer was yes,

03:06:43.240 --> 03:06:44.920
that you would be feeling the same thing.

03:06:44.920 --> 03:06:47.120
Okay, now here's where it gets fun.

03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:51.840
Now that every cell in your brain

03:06:53.520 --> 03:06:56.920
knows what it has to do in the sense that we know it

03:06:56.920 --> 03:06:58.080
and we're providing it,

03:06:58.840 --> 03:07:01.720
your brain cells don't need to be in your head anymore

03:07:01.720 --> 03:07:03.160
at all, right?

03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:04.960
The only reason they're next to each other,

03:07:04.960 --> 03:07:06.520
the only reason they're wired together

03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:08.360
is to affect each other,

03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:10.600
to stimulate or inhibit each other.

03:07:10.600 --> 03:07:13.720
But we don't need that anymore because optogenetically,

03:07:13.720 --> 03:07:15.680
we're providing that activity pattern

03:07:15.680 --> 03:07:16.520
for as long as needed.

03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:18.560
We're providing the effect of the communication.

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.720
They don't need to be connected anymore.

03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:22.880
They don't even need to be in your head.

03:07:22.880 --> 03:07:26.680
I could spread your neurons all over the continent

03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:29.280
all over the galaxy.

03:07:30.320 --> 03:07:34.120
And I could still provide the same stimulus pattern

03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:36.880
over 10 or 15 seconds to all those neurons.

03:07:36.880 --> 03:07:41.680
And somewhere Lex Fridman would have to be,

03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:45.360
even though no longer existing as a physical object anymore

03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:48.320
would be feeling that subjective feeling.

03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:50.720
And it's inescapable because it's exactly the same

03:07:50.720 --> 03:07:52.120
as the previous situation.

03:07:52.120 --> 03:07:54.960
All the neurons have to be spatially,

03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:56.880
like the locality constraint.

03:07:56.880 --> 03:07:59.040
They have to be spatially close to each other.

03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:03.720
And you talk about light, opto,

03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:08.720
which is funny because light is the fastest traveling thing

03:08:09.320 --> 03:08:10.360
that we know of.

03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:13.080
Maybe let's not put them all over the universe

03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:14.640
because we might get relativistic problems then.

03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:15.760
Let's just keep them out.

03:08:15.760 --> 03:08:16.960
Let's keep all your neurons.

03:08:16.960 --> 03:08:19.200
Let's spread them over North America, okay?

03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:21.040
And let's play them out.

03:08:21.040 --> 03:08:22.680
Same pattern of activity.

03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:24.160
And right, it seems absurd, right?

03:08:24.160 --> 03:08:25.920
There's no way that could be true.

03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:29.720
There's no way that Lex would be feeling that internal sense

03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:32.760
if his neurons were spread all over North America.

03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:35.160
And yet it's exactly the same as the previous situation

03:08:35.160 --> 03:08:36.680
where you said, sure.

03:08:36.680 --> 03:08:37.520
Wow.

03:08:37.520 --> 03:08:38.360
So we've got a paradox.

03:08:38.360 --> 03:08:39.200
And this is what makes people think.

03:08:39.200 --> 03:08:40.240
Is this a paradox though?

03:08:40.240 --> 03:08:41.680
Sorry, yeah, yeah.

03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:42.600
Maybe paradox is the wrong word.

03:08:42.600 --> 03:08:44.000
We've got a problem.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.120
We've got a problem because it reveals

03:08:46.120 --> 03:08:50.440
that there's something big about that internal

03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:53.120
subjective state that we're not explaining.

03:08:53.160 --> 03:08:54.720
And we don't really have a hope of explaining

03:08:54.720 --> 03:08:55.760
in the near future.

03:08:55.760 --> 03:08:58.720
But don't you think we would still have that?

03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:00.600
It's just the word internal loses meaning,

03:09:00.600 --> 03:09:02.240
but don't you think we would still have

03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:04.400
that internal subjective state?

03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:09.400
Or if not, then where the heck is the magic coming from?

03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:15.800
Okay, well, I just think, I think one of the problems

03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:21.600
that I think we need to let go of is we tend to,

03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:23.520
outside of the experience of consciousness,

03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:25.760
the hard problem of consciousness,

03:09:25.760 --> 03:09:28.000
we tend to think that we individual humans

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:29.200
are really special.

03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:33.240
Not the subjective experience, but the entirety of it,

03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:35.840
like the body that contains the thing.

03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:40.840
So the local, the constraint of all the stuff

03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:43.360
has to be together and it's all mine.

03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:48.680
That's a very, I don't know if that has anything to do

03:09:48.680 --> 03:09:52.000
with the mechanisms that are creating this.

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:57.000
So in fact, one really nice way to break through that

03:09:57.000 --> 03:10:01.040
is to either achieve, either observe

03:10:01.040 --> 03:10:06.040
or create consciousness that spans multiple organisms.

03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:10.800
So like, let's say it's not,

03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:15.160
it's not an organism-dependent phenomena,

03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:17.560
that the phenomena can,

03:10:17.560 --> 03:10:22.160
that's just a peculiar way it has evolved on Earth,

03:10:22.160 --> 03:10:26.320
but it's a phenomena that doesn't have anything to do

03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:30.520
with a specific biological system.

03:10:31.680 --> 03:10:35.760
Yeah, so and we have different parts of our brain exist

03:10:35.760 --> 03:10:40.760
and sometimes create complex awarenesses of things

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:46.360
that involve different neurons that are distributed widely

03:10:47.360 --> 03:10:49.040
and that need to communicate with each other

03:10:49.040 --> 03:10:51.240
to form this joint representation,

03:10:51.240 --> 03:10:53.120
this state of consciousness.

03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:57.280
But indeed, why do they have to be in the same head?

03:10:57.280 --> 03:11:01.280
We don't know why that would be the case that they do.

03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:06.640
And so that's a huge unanswered question in the field

03:11:06.640 --> 03:11:11.640
is what is it that binds the activity of neurons together

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:14.440
so they can form a joint representation?

03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:16.840
And actually this comes back to the dissociation experiment

03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:18.560
we talked about before where you can,

03:11:18.560 --> 03:11:22.440
your sense of self becomes separated from your body.

03:11:23.760 --> 03:11:26.600
Those things that were fused in a joint representation,

03:11:26.600 --> 03:11:29.880
the same concept unitary are now separate.

03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:35.440
And in late 2020, we published a paper in Nature

03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:37.160
showing how this could be,

03:11:37.160 --> 03:11:41.000
we used optogenetics to drive this rhythm

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:44.000
that ketamine and PCP cause in retrosplenial cortex

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:47.520
and we got different parts of the brain to be out of sync

03:11:47.520 --> 03:11:49.360
and when they were active,

03:11:49.360 --> 03:11:51.680
never able to be active at the same time,

03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:56.120
never able to form a joint representation at the same time.

03:11:56.120 --> 03:11:58.080
And so we've got a toehold into these questions.

03:11:58.080 --> 03:11:59.920
We don't have the answers, but.

03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:02.600
And that mimics the dynamics of ketamine effects.

03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:04.280
Exactly, exactly.

03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:06.920
And you're able to find that kind of oscillation.

03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:09.960
Wow, wow, wow.

03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:13.520
So if you get even greater and greater control

03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:16.000
with more control over individual neurons

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:17.280
and understanding,

03:12:18.120 --> 03:12:19.840
like if you think of certain neurons

03:12:19.840 --> 03:12:24.520
that having some role to play in the sense of self,

03:12:24.520 --> 03:12:26.120
you can play like an orchestra

03:12:27.760 --> 03:12:31.720
that to create certain degrees of consciousness,

03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:33.240
degrees of subjectivity

03:12:33.240 --> 03:12:37.480
and thereby understand what is consciousness

03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:40.880
by having a very complicated light switch essentially.

03:12:41.720 --> 03:12:44.800
And here's the challenge is the nice thing

03:12:44.800 --> 03:12:48.240
about the thought experiment is it kind of highlights

03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:51.800
that we're gonna hit a point where

03:12:53.920 --> 03:12:57.440
we're addressing some very, very fundamental questions.

03:12:57.440 --> 03:13:02.440
What allows the activity of two sets of neurons

03:13:03.680 --> 03:13:07.120
to become mutually relevant to each other?

03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:09.600
This is in some ways,

03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:12.360
maybe one of the deepest remaining questions

03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:15.520
in neurosciences is what allows activity patterns

03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:18.920
to become relevant to each other.

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:21.200
Do they have to be in sync temporarily?

03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:22.480
Do they need to be?

03:13:23.920 --> 03:13:26.880
Is there some other quality that we don't know about

03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:28.440
that also needs to be present

03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:32.120
to allow cells to fuse together into a joint representation?

03:13:32.120 --> 03:13:34.080
Just so I understand,

03:13:34.120 --> 03:13:39.120
because it feels close to some very, very deep idea.

03:13:41.120 --> 03:13:43.640
So there's a bunch of semi-distributed signals

03:13:43.640 --> 03:13:44.880
going on in the brain.

03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:50.280
And you're saying there could be

03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:53.840
something like a theory of everything if one to exist

03:13:53.840 --> 03:13:56.200
is to understand why,

03:13:56.200 --> 03:13:59.600
how and why signals close to each other

03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:05.320
start becoming relevant to each other.

03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:07.040
That's right, that's right.

03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:10.880
As part of some very much bigger signal

03:14:10.880 --> 03:14:12.440
that they're producing.

03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:14.960
How they coordinate, essentially.

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:18.440
Because it's very distributed.

03:14:18.440 --> 03:14:22.440
I mean, that's a kind of, within a distributed system,

03:14:22.440 --> 03:14:24.280
how is order achieved?

03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:28.840
And this is a very specific kind of distributed system

03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:31.000
that is one of the most intelligent

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.920
that we're aware of in the known universe.

03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:37.040
And that will maybe be something,

03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:42.040
also an understanding of the full conscious experience, too.

03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.480
That this kind of coordination.

03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:46.680
How does the coordination between different neurons

03:14:46.680 --> 03:14:49.080
that are responsible for sense of self,

03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:51.800
how do they begin to form a big picture

03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:54.120
that we see as a human experience?

03:14:54.120 --> 03:14:55.560
That's really, really interesting.

03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:56.920
So uniting the small,

03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:00.960
I mean, that's actually literally theory of everything.

03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:03.840
Uniting the small, the sort of the theory of the neuron.

03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:07.800
The function of the neuron with the big,

03:15:07.800 --> 03:15:12.040
which is the functioning of the entire mind.

03:15:12.040 --> 03:15:12.880
That's right.

03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:14.200
And I think keeping a toehold

03:15:14.200 --> 03:15:17.800
in both at the cellular level of resolution

03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:19.720
and the brain-wide resolution will be critical.

03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:21.320
If you lose touch with either,

03:15:21.320 --> 03:15:23.560
I think you'll miss the big insight.

03:15:23.560 --> 03:15:25.360
So that's what we're trying to do.

03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:29.200
Keeping grounded in the cellular resolution,

03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:32.200
trying to keep the broadest brain-wide perspective

03:15:32.200 --> 03:15:33.240
and meet in the middle.

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:36.920
Do you think you'll see it in your lifetime?

03:15:36.920 --> 03:15:39.560
A major breakthrough in that dimension.

03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:40.400
I have hope.

03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:42.040
I have hope.

03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:43.760
It's very hard to predict what will happen

03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:45.480
with big things like this.

03:15:45.480 --> 03:15:46.840
If we don't get there,

03:15:46.840 --> 03:15:48.560
there'll be plenty of other exciting stuff.

03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:49.760
So it's okay.

03:15:50.760 --> 03:15:52.920
But the other aspect of this whole thing

03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:56.000
is that your life is pretty short.

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:56.840
That's true.

03:15:56.840 --> 03:15:59.440
So first of all, you can die any day.

03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:01.320
I tend to try to think about that,

03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:03.880
that it can get in at any moment

03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:05.640
because it really, really can.

03:16:05.640 --> 03:16:08.760
And if not, it'll be soon anyway.

03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:09.960
Do you think about that?

03:16:09.960 --> 03:16:12.280
Do you think about your mortality?

03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:13.120
I do, yeah.

03:16:13.120 --> 03:16:15.880
It comes back to what we talked about earlier.

03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:18.480
I never think I've done enough

03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:20.840
and it's relevant to that for sure.

03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:23.480
There's a deadline.

03:16:25.080 --> 03:16:27.200
Do you think there's ever going to be a feeling

03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:31.720
where you sit back and you're really proud of yourself?

03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:35.680
I hope so.

03:16:35.680 --> 03:16:36.720
I've done enough.

03:16:36.720 --> 03:16:38.480
I've done everything there is.

03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.080
Because the thing is,

03:16:41.080 --> 03:16:44.840
a warrior has some number of battles in them.

03:16:44.840 --> 03:16:45.880
And at a certain point,

03:16:45.880 --> 03:16:47.040
if you're deeply honest,

03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:50.280
it's like, well, that was a pretty good run.

03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:53.080
As far as runs goes, that was pretty good.

03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:55.280
And you can hang up your helmet

03:16:55.280 --> 03:17:00.280
and then go sort of drink some ale,

03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:03.640
listen to some music with the old lady

03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:04.960
and say, I did pretty good.

03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:06.320
You think you'll get there?

03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:13.000
Nature always has surprises for us.

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:17.440
The curious mind is always after more.

03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:22.160
But biology gives us other rewards,

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:25.040
children and family, community.

03:17:26.080 --> 03:17:28.440
And one can feel good about those things.

03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:31.760
Biology is full of rewards.

03:17:31.760 --> 03:17:34.800
But do you think about those rewards?

03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:37.080
What do you think is the why of those rewards?

03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:40.200
What's the meaning of life and this existence?

03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:44.520
What's the why of biology?

03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:45.520
What does it want from us?

03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:48.000
Why are all these cells very busy

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:49.360
putting together an organism

03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:53.720
that seems to want to just be in a hurry to do stuff

03:17:53.720 --> 03:17:56.360
and survive, but it also just doesn't,

03:17:56.360 --> 03:17:57.600
it's not happy being survived.

03:17:57.600 --> 03:17:59.280
Like you said, it's curious.

03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:01.680
It keeps wanting to get into more trouble.

03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:03.000
Why?

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:07.400
Yeah, we're clearly designed for that, right?

03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:10.760
We're clearly designed to ask why and to answer.

03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:15.360
And that I think is, I don't know the meaning of all life.

03:18:15.360 --> 03:18:17.960
I think a meaning of our lives is that,

03:18:17.960 --> 03:18:21.560
and this is the Aristotelian happiness.

03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:24.360
This is an organism is happy, an animal's happy

03:18:24.360 --> 03:18:26.480
if it's performing to its design, right?

03:18:26.480 --> 03:18:29.440
If it's doing what it was made for.

03:18:30.560 --> 03:18:33.720
Well, you have to understand what's the design

03:18:33.720 --> 03:18:38.720
and who is the designer and what were they up to

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:43.880
and how hard is it?

03:18:43.880 --> 03:18:45.240
Do you have to build the whole universe?

03:18:46.080 --> 03:18:47.680
And does the design even know what the hell they're doing?

03:18:47.680 --> 03:18:51.760
Because maybe the designer built humus

03:18:51.760 --> 03:18:56.520
to find out about themselves.

03:18:56.520 --> 03:18:58.000
That's what I would do.

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.760
If I had the power to build clones,

03:19:00.760 --> 03:19:02.520
I'll build a lot of clones

03:19:02.520 --> 03:19:04.880
and I'll get them into different trouble

03:19:04.880 --> 03:19:09.880
to understand what's this body designed to do?

03:19:10.480 --> 03:19:11.760
How far can I go that way?

03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:12.920
Exactly.

03:19:13.400 --> 03:19:15.680
And I dissociate myself completely

03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:19.200
from having any way that I know that person.

03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:20.040
That's good.

03:19:20.040 --> 03:19:21.320
I mean, I suppose you could do that

03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:25.080
in a single person's body by dissociation.

03:19:25.080 --> 03:19:27.360
You could, yeah.

03:19:27.360 --> 03:19:32.360
But I do wonder what, if you look at Earth

03:19:32.640 --> 03:19:33.800
as a collection of humans,

03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:35.960
as a collection of biological organisms,

03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:39.000
it seems that we're busy doing something.

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:45.000
And it just seems too beautiful and too special

03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:48.440
to be a random experiment.

03:19:51.680 --> 03:19:55.760
It seems like it's an experiment that's cleverly designed

03:19:57.160 --> 03:19:58.000
That's right.

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.680
by some forces of nature

03:20:00.680 --> 03:20:03.600
that are beyond our current understanding.

03:20:03.600 --> 03:20:05.560
And maybe that's part of our design

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:06.560
is to keep asking why.

03:20:06.560 --> 03:20:07.400
He said answer.

03:20:07.400 --> 03:20:10.400
I'm not sure that's part of the design, the answer.

03:20:11.840 --> 03:20:14.680
I think we're given just the sufficiently

03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:16.400
limited cognitive capability

03:20:16.400 --> 03:20:20.760
that we know how to long to find the answer

03:20:20.760 --> 03:20:24.160
and we lack the ability to find the answer.

03:20:24.160 --> 03:20:26.480
That's basically a summary of your career.

03:20:26.480 --> 03:20:27.840
No, I'm just kidding.

03:20:27.840 --> 03:20:29.520
And then we give each other Nobel prizes

03:20:29.520 --> 03:20:33.240
for having even an inkling of a good step

03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:35.160
towards the right direction.

03:20:35.160 --> 03:20:37.280
Carl, you're an incredible human being.

03:20:38.600 --> 03:20:41.040
I'm a huge fan of who you are as a person,

03:20:41.040 --> 03:20:43.600
who you are as a scientist, who you are as a writer.

03:20:43.600 --> 03:20:45.320
I just thank you so much.

03:20:45.320 --> 03:20:46.720
I'm so honored that you would sit down

03:20:46.720 --> 03:20:47.560
and talk to me today.

03:20:47.560 --> 03:20:48.400
It was amazing.

03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:49.880
It's been incredibly fun.

03:20:49.880 --> 03:20:50.720
Let's do it again sometime.

03:20:50.720 --> 03:20:51.560
Let's do it again.

03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:52.400
It's been really great.

03:20:52.400 --> 03:20:55.640
Your insights and wit and modesty

03:20:55.640 --> 03:20:58.280
are really quite rewarding.

03:20:58.280 --> 03:20:59.280
Thanks so much, man.

03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:02.080

And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Jung.

03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:14.000
Knowing your own darkness is the best method

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.360
for dealing with the darkness of other people.

03:21:17.240 --> 03:21:20.480
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
