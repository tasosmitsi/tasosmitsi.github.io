00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
Listen, when it comes to romantic relationships,

00:02.080 --> 00:07.080
if it's not a hundred percent in you, it ain't happening.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.240
And I've never seen a violation of that statement

00:12.240 --> 00:14.800
where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good and there this,

00:14.800 --> 00:17.120
and there's like the negotiations,

00:17.120 --> 00:19.400
already it's doomed.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.800
And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect,

00:20.800 --> 00:22.020
the relationship has to be perfect,

00:22.020 --> 00:24.840
but it's got to feel a hundred percent inside,

00:24.840 --> 00:27.480
like yes, yes, and yes.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.440
The following is a conversation with my dear friend,

00:32.440 --> 00:35.880
Andrew Huberman, his fourth time on this podcast.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.200
It's my birthday, so this is a special birthday episode

00:39.200 --> 00:41.480
of sorts, Andrew flew down to Austin

00:41.480 --> 00:43.160
just to wish me a happy birthday,

00:43.160 --> 00:45.860
and we decided to do a podcast last second.

00:45.860 --> 00:48.120
We literally talked for hours beforehand,

00:48.120 --> 00:51.440
and a long time after, late into the night,

00:51.440 --> 00:53.420
he's one of my favorite human beings,

00:53.420 --> 00:55.680
brilliant scientist, incredible teacher,

00:55.720 --> 00:58.160
and a loyal friend.

00:58.160 --> 01:02.280
I'm grateful for Andrew, I'm grateful for good friends,

01:02.280 --> 01:04.160
for all the support and love I've gotten

01:04.160 --> 01:05.640
over the past few years.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.040
I'm truly grateful for this life,

01:09.040 --> 01:11.360
for the years, the days, the minutes, the seconds

01:11.360 --> 01:14.800
I've gotten to live on this beautiful earth of ours.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.820
I really don't want to leave just yet.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.340
I think I'd really like to stick around.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.800
I love you all.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.120
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast,

01:26.120 --> 01:30.280
and now, dear friends, here's Andrew Huberman.

01:31.440 --> 01:34.560
Trying to run a little bit more.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.600
Are you losing weight?

01:35.600 --> 01:36.540
I'm not trying to lose weight,

01:36.540 --> 01:39.200
but I always do the same fitness routine.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.640
After like 30 years, basically lift three days a week,

01:42.640 --> 01:46.760
run three days a week, but one of the runs is a long run,

01:46.760 --> 01:48.920
one of them's medium, one of them's a sprint type thing.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.200
So what I've decided to do this year

01:51.200 --> 01:55.620
was just extend the duration of the long run,

01:55.620 --> 01:59.160
and I like being mobile.

01:59.160 --> 02:03.040
I never want to be so heavy that I can't move.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.400
Like I want to be able to go out

02:04.400 --> 02:07.640
and run 10 miles if I have to, so sometimes I do.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.600
And I want to be able to sprint if I have to,

02:09.600 --> 02:10.720
so sometimes I do.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.760
And lifting in objects feels good.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.960
It feels good to train like a lazy bear

02:16.960 --> 02:17.920
and just lift heavy objects,

02:17.920 --> 02:20.160
but I've also started training with lighter weights

02:20.160 --> 02:24.860
and higher repetitions for three month cycles,

02:24.860 --> 02:26.640
and it gives your joints a rest.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.440
And yeah, so I think it also is interesting

02:30.440 --> 02:33.660
to see how training differently changes your cognition.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.360
That's probably hormone related,

02:35.360 --> 02:37.140
hormones downstream of training heavy

02:37.140 --> 02:40.800
versus hormones downstream of training a little bit lighter.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.920
I think my cognition is better when I'm doing more cardio

02:44.920 --> 02:49.120
and when the repetition ranges are a little bit higher,

02:49.120 --> 02:52.320
which is not to say that people who lift heavy are dumb,

02:52.320 --> 02:53.440
but there is a,

02:53.440 --> 02:55.200
because there's real value in lifting heavy.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.240
There's a lot of angry people listening to this right now.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.280
No, no, no, but lifting heavy

02:59.280 --> 03:01.320
and then taking three to five minutes rest

03:01.320 --> 03:04.360
is far and away a different challenge

03:04.360 --> 03:08.680
than running hard for 90 minutes.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.560
That's a tough thing.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.640
Just like getting in an ice bath,

03:10.640 --> 03:11.480
people say, oh, well,

03:11.480 --> 03:14.040
how is that any different than working out?

03:14.040 --> 03:15.040
Well, there are a lot of differences,

03:15.040 --> 03:18.680
but one of them is that it's very acute stress

03:18.680 --> 03:21.000
within one second you're stressed.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.120
So I think subjecting the body

03:23.120 --> 03:25.760
to a bunch of different types of stressors

03:25.760 --> 03:28.000
in space and time is really valuable.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.600
So yeah, I've been playing with the variables

03:29.600 --> 03:30.860
in a pretty systematic way.

03:30.860 --> 03:35.860
Well, I like long and slow for, like you said,

03:35.960 --> 03:37.760
the impact that has on my cognition.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.440
Yeah, the wordlessness of it,

03:41.440 --> 03:43.760
the way it puts you in a,

03:43.760 --> 03:46.640
the way it seems to clean out the clutter,

03:46.760 --> 03:49.520
you know, it can take away that hyper focus

03:49.520 --> 03:53.840
and put you more in a relaxed focus for sure.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.040
Well, for me, it brings the clutter

03:55.040 --> 03:56.720
to the surface at first.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.560
Like all these thoughts come in there

03:58.560 --> 03:59.920
and then they dissipate.

03:59.920 --> 04:00.760
You know, I've been,

04:00.760 --> 04:02.560
because I got knee barred pretty hard.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.120
That's when somebody tries to break your knee.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.280
That was just what's a knee bar.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.520
They try and break your knee?

04:06.520 --> 04:07.560
Oh, I see you tap.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.400
So they-

04:08.400 --> 04:09.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:09.220 --> 04:11.040
So it's, you know, hyper extending the knee

04:11.040 --> 04:11.880
that direction.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.280
I got knee barred pretty hard.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.080
So in ways I don't understand,

04:16.080 --> 04:17.800
it kind of hurts to run.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.720
I don't understand what's happening behind there.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.080
I need to investigate this.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.880
It basically, this, the hamstring flex,

04:24.880 --> 04:27.320
like curling your leg hurts a little bit.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.880
And that results in this weird dull,

04:30.880 --> 04:34.440
but sometimes extremely sharp pain in the back of the knee.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.160
So I'm working through this anyway,

04:37.160 --> 04:38.280
but walking doesn't hurt.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.280
So I've been playing around with walking recently,

04:42.280 --> 04:44.360
like for two hours and thinking.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.120
Because I know a lot of like smart people

04:47.120 --> 04:50.880
throughout history have walked and thought,

04:50.880 --> 04:52.280
and you have to like, you know,

04:52.280 --> 04:54.680
play with things that have worked for others,

04:54.680 --> 04:56.080
not just to exercise,

04:56.080 --> 04:59.440
but to like integrate this very light kind of

04:59.440 --> 05:03.000
prolonged exercise into a productive life.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.960
So they do all their thinking while they walk.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.200
It's like a meditative type of walking.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.600
And it's really interesting.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.960
It really works.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.680
Yeah, the practice I've been doing a lot more of lately

05:13.680 --> 05:15.400
is I walk while reading a book.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.000
In the yard, I'll just pace back and forth

05:17.000 --> 05:18.160
or walk in a circle.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.000
Audio book?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.680
No, a hard copy.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.520
Where you just holding?

05:21.520 --> 05:23.280
I holding the book and I'm walking and I'm reading.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.080
Yeah, and I usually have a pen and I'm underlining.

05:25.080 --> 05:25.920
I have this whole system,

05:25.920 --> 05:28.240
like underlining stars, exclamation points,

05:28.240 --> 05:31.160
goes back to university of what things I'll go back to,

05:31.160 --> 05:34.040
which things I export to notes and that kind of thing.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.280
But from the beginning, when I opened my lab

05:37.280 --> 05:38.360
at that time in San Diego,

05:38.360 --> 05:40.200
before I moved back to Stanford,

05:41.400 --> 05:43.480
I would have meetings with my students or postdocs

05:43.480 --> 05:46.160
by just walking in the field behind the lab.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.800
And I'd bring my Bulldog Costello,

05:51.800 --> 05:54.600
Bulldog Mastiff at the time, and he was a slow walker.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.520
So these were slow walks,

05:56.520 --> 05:58.680
but I can think much more clearly that way.

05:58.680 --> 06:01.400
There's a Nobel Prize winning professor

06:01.400 --> 06:04.120
at Columbia University School of Medicine, Richard Axel,

06:04.120 --> 06:05.200
won the Nobel Prize,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.400
co-won Nobel Prize with Linda Buck

06:07.400 --> 06:09.480
for the discovery of the molecular basis of olfaction.

06:09.480 --> 06:13.240
And he walks in and voice dictates his papers.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.000
And now with Rev or these other,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.120
maybe there are better ones than Rev,

06:17.120 --> 06:20.200
where you can convert audio files into text very quickly

06:20.200 --> 06:21.280
and then edit from there.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.960
So I will often voice dictate first drafts

06:24.960 --> 06:26.160
and things like that.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.480
And I totally agree on the long runs, the walks,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.240
the integrating that with cognitive work,

06:31.240 --> 06:32.520
harder to do with sprints.

06:33.440 --> 06:36.520
And then the gym, are you weight trained?

06:36.520 --> 06:40.160
You just seem naturally strong and like thicker jointed.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.320
It's true, it's true.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.560
I mean, we did the one very beginner

06:43.560 --> 06:46.720
cause I'm a very beginner of jujitsu class together.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.080
And yeah, as I mentioned then,

06:49.080 --> 06:52.400
but if people missed it, Lex is freakishly strong.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.120
I think I was born genetically to hug people.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.640
Oh, like Costello.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.480
Exactly.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.920
You guys have a certain similarity.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.480
He had wrists like, you know,

07:00.480 --> 07:03.160
it's like you and Jaco and Costello have these like wrists

07:03.160 --> 07:05.320
and elbows that are super thick, you know?

07:05.320 --> 07:07.640
And then when you look around, you see tremendous variation.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.440
Some people will have like the wrist width of a Whippet

07:12.440 --> 07:13.320
or Woody Allen.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.800
And then other people like you or Jaco or, you know,

07:15.800 --> 07:19.320
there's this one Jaco video or thing on GQ or something.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.680
Have you seen the comments on Jaco?

07:20.680 --> 07:21.800
These are the best.

07:21.800 --> 07:22.760
No.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.040
The comments, I love the comments on YouTube

07:25.040 --> 07:27.160
cause occasionally they're funny.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.960
The best is when Jaco was born,

07:28.960 --> 07:33.440
the doctor looked at his parents and said, it's a man.

07:35.600 --> 07:36.720
Chuck Norris type comments.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.160
Oh yeah, those are great.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.240
That's what I miss about Rogan being on YouTube

07:40.240 --> 07:41.520
with the full length episodes.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.680
Oh, that comment.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.720
So this is technically a birthday podcast.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.920
What do you love most about getting older?

07:50.760 --> 07:55.760
It's like the confirmation that comes from getting more

07:57.560 --> 08:00.160
and more data, which basically says, yeah,

08:00.160 --> 08:01.800
the first time you thought that thing,

08:01.800 --> 08:03.520
it was actually right because the second, third

08:03.520 --> 08:05.600
and fourth and fifth time,

08:05.600 --> 08:06.880
it turned out the exact same way.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.320
In other words, there have been a few times in my life

08:10.320 --> 08:15.320
where I did not feel easy about something.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.160
I felt a signal from my body, this is not good.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.280
And I didn't trust it early on, but I knew it was there.

08:25.280 --> 08:30.280
And then two or three bad experiences later,

08:31.040 --> 08:33.040
I'm able to say, ah, every single time

08:33.040 --> 08:36.160
there was a signal from the body informing my mind,

08:37.040 --> 08:38.600
this is not good.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.200
Now, the reverse has also been true

08:40.200 --> 08:41.880
that there've been a number of instances

08:41.880 --> 08:44.160
in which I feel sort of immediate delight.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.480
And there's this kind of almost astonishingly

08:47.480 --> 08:51.400
simple experience of feeling comfortable with somebody

08:51.400 --> 08:55.400
or at peace with something or delighted at an experience.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.720
And it turns out all, literally all of those experiences

08:59.720 --> 09:01.800
and people turned out to be experiences

09:01.800 --> 09:03.720
and people that are still in my life

09:03.720 --> 09:06.440
and that I still delight in every day.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.360
In other words, what's great about getting older

09:09.360 --> 09:14.360
is that you stop questioning the signals

09:14.560 --> 09:17.080
that come from the, I think, deeper recesses

09:17.080 --> 09:20.120
of your nervous system to say, hey, this is not good

09:20.120 --> 09:23.280
or hey, this is great, more of this.

09:23.280 --> 09:28.280
Whereas I think in my teens, my 20s, my 30s,

09:28.640 --> 09:31.400
I'm 40, almost 48, I'll be 48 next month.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.880
I didn't trust, I didn't listen.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.720
I actually put a lot of work into overriding those signals

09:39.720 --> 09:40.800
and learning to fight through them,

09:40.800 --> 09:42.840
thinking that somehow that was making me tougher

09:42.840 --> 09:46.960
or somehow that was making me smarter

09:46.960 --> 09:49.600
when in fact, in the end, those people that you meet

09:49.600 --> 09:53.480
that are difficult or there are other names for it,

09:53.480 --> 09:54.840
it's like in the end, you're like,

09:54.840 --> 09:56.480
yeah, that person's a piece of shit.

09:56.480 --> 10:01.480
Or this person is amazing and they're really wonderful

10:01.640 --> 10:03.720
and I felt that from go.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.920
So you've learned to trust your gut

10:05.920 --> 10:09.000
versus the influences of other people's opinions.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.720
I've learned to trust my gut versus the forebrain

10:13.720 --> 10:16.680
over analysis, overriding the gut.

10:16.680 --> 10:21.680
Other people often in my life have had great optics.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.080
I've benefited tremendously from an early age

10:24.080 --> 10:25.560
of being in a large community

10:25.600 --> 10:26.640
and I've been mostly guys

10:26.640 --> 10:27.800
but I have some close female friends

10:27.800 --> 10:31.240
and always have as well who will tell me

10:31.240 --> 10:34.000
that's a bad decision or this person not so good

10:34.000 --> 10:37.400
or be careful or they're great or that's great.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.640
So oftentimes my community and the people around me

10:39.640 --> 10:44.520
have been more aligned with the correct choice than not.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.600
Really? Yes.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.320
Really, when you were younger, like grandparents and so on?

10:50.320 --> 10:53.200
I don't recall ever really listening to my parents.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.440
I grew up in a, you know,

10:54.440 --> 10:56.160
we don't have to go back to my childhood thing

10:56.160 --> 10:58.160
but my sense- It's not your fault, Andrew.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.000
Thank you.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.320
I learned that recently in a psilocybin journey.

11:02.320 --> 11:06.040
My first high dose psilocybin journey, which was-

11:06.040 --> 11:06.880
Welcome back.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.160
Done with a clinician, thank you very much, thank you.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.320
I was worried there for a second at one point

11:11.320 --> 11:14.720
in my not coming back but in any event,

11:14.720 --> 11:17.680
yeah, I grew up with some wild kids.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.040
I would say about a third of my friends

11:19.040 --> 11:20.840
from childhood are dead or in jail.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.680
About a third have gone on to do

11:23.680 --> 11:25.520
tremendously impressive things,

11:25.520 --> 11:28.400
start companies, excellent athletes,

11:28.400 --> 11:32.400
academics, scientists, and clinicians.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.160
And then about a third are living their lives

11:34.160 --> 11:35.600
as kind of more typical.

11:35.600 --> 11:40.440
I just mean that they are happy family people with jobs

11:40.440 --> 11:44.400
that they mainly serve the function to make money.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.200
They're not sort of career into their career

11:46.200 --> 11:47.040
for career sake.

11:47.040 --> 11:52.040
But so some of my friends early on gave me some bad ideas

11:53.560 --> 11:56.640
but most of the time my bad ideas came

11:56.640 --> 12:01.640
from overriding the signals that I knew that my body

12:02.880 --> 12:07.880
and I would say my body and brain were telling me to obey.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.520
And why I say body and brain is that there's this brain

12:10.520 --> 12:14.480
region, the insula, which does many things

12:14.480 --> 12:18.040
but it represents our sense of internal sensation

12:18.040 --> 12:19.240
interoception.

12:19.240 --> 12:21.200
And I was talking to Paul Conte about this,

12:21.200 --> 12:24.960
you know, who, as you know, I respect tremendously.

12:24.960 --> 12:27.560
I think he's one of the smartest people I've ever met.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.560
I think for different reasons, he and Marc Andreessen

12:29.560 --> 12:32.560
are some of the smartest people I've ever met

12:32.560 --> 12:34.920
but Paul's level of insight into the human psyche

12:34.920 --> 12:36.480
is absolutely astounding.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.640
And he says the opposite of what most

12:44.600 --> 12:46.520
people say about the brain, which is most people say,

12:46.520 --> 12:48.760
oh, the supercomputer of the brain is the forebrain.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.000
It's like a monkey brain with a extra real estate

12:51.000 --> 12:53.600
put on there and the forebrain is what makes us human

12:54.800 --> 12:57.360
and gives us our superpowers.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.600
Paul has said, and he's done a whole series

13:01.600 --> 13:04.340
on mental health that's coming out from our podcast

13:04.340 --> 13:05.180
in September.

13:05.180 --> 13:06.300
So this is not an attempt to plug that

13:06.300 --> 13:08.120
but he'll elaborate on what I'm about to say.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.360
Wait, you're doing a thing with Paul?

13:09.360 --> 13:10.200
We already did.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.360
Yeah, so Paul Conte shot up, we did,

13:13.360 --> 13:15.440
he and I sat down, he did a four episode series

13:15.440 --> 13:16.560
on mental health.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.740
This is not mental illness, mental health

13:18.740 --> 13:20.860
about how to explore one's own subconscious,

13:21.900 --> 13:26.900
explore the self, build and cultivate the generative drive.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.860
You'll learn more about what that is from him.

13:28.860 --> 13:31.740
He's far more eloquent and clear than I am.

13:32.620 --> 13:36.080
And he provides essentially a set of steps

13:36.080 --> 13:38.680
to explore the self that does not require

13:38.680 --> 13:39.720
that you work with a therapist.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.040
This is self-exploration that is rooted

13:42.040 --> 13:45.400
in psychiatry, it's rooted in neuroscience.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.280
And I don't think this information exists anywhere else.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.240
I'm not aware that it exists anywhere else.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.600
And he essentially distills it all down

13:52.600 --> 13:56.640
to one eight and a half by 11 sheet

13:56.640 --> 13:58.400
which we provide for people.

13:58.400 --> 14:03.160
And he says there, I don't wanna give too much away

14:03.160 --> 14:05.840
because I would detract from what he does so beautifully

14:05.840 --> 14:08.600
but if I tried and I went to accomplish it anyway.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.660
But he said, and I believe that the subconscious

14:13.660 --> 14:16.000
is the supercomputer of the brain.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.580
All the stuff working underneath our conscious awareness

14:18.580 --> 14:21.400
that's driving our feelings and what we think

14:21.400 --> 14:24.520
are the decisions that we've thought through so carefully.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.520
And that only by exploring the subconscious

14:27.520 --> 14:29.820
and understanding it a little bit,

14:29.820 --> 14:34.240
can we actually improve ourselves over time.

14:34.240 --> 14:35.240
And I agree.

14:35.760 --> 14:40.440
So the mistake is to think that thinking can override it all.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.720
It's a certain style of introspection and thinking

14:43.720 --> 14:47.260
that allows us to read the signals from our body,

14:47.260 --> 14:48.320
read the signals from our brain,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.920
integrate the knowledge that we're collecting

14:50.920 --> 14:53.520
about ourselves and to use all that in ways

14:53.520 --> 14:56.400
that are really adaptive and generative for us.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.800
What do you think is there in that subconscious?

14:58.800 --> 15:01.640
What do you think of the younging and shadow?

15:01.640 --> 15:03.360
What's there?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.380
There's this idea, as you're familiar with too,

15:05.380 --> 15:06.880
I'm sure that this younging and idea

15:06.880 --> 15:09.840
that we all have all things inside of us,

15:09.840 --> 15:11.880
that all of us have the capacity to be evil,

15:11.880 --> 15:14.520
to be good, et cetera, but that some people express one

15:14.520 --> 15:16.520
or the other to greater extent.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.960
But he also mentioned that there's a unique category

15:19.960 --> 15:22.480
of people, maybe two to 5% of people

15:22.480 --> 15:24.800
that don't just have all things inside of them

15:24.800 --> 15:27.080
but they actually spend a lot of time exploring

15:27.080 --> 15:29.520
a lot of those things, the darker recesses,

15:29.520 --> 15:31.380
the shadows, their own shadows.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.320
I'm somebody who's drawn to goodness and to light

15:37.320 --> 15:39.640
and to joy and all those things like anybody else,

15:39.640 --> 15:43.000
but I think maybe it was part of how I grew up.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.700
Maybe it was the crowd I was with.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.560
But then again, even when I started spending more time

15:49.560 --> 15:50.920
with academics and scientists,

15:50.920 --> 15:54.120
I mean, you see shadows in other ways, right?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.680
You see pure ambition with no passion.

15:56.680 --> 16:00.920
I recall a colleague in San Diego who,

16:00.920 --> 16:03.720
it was very clear to me, did not actually care

16:03.720 --> 16:05.100
about understanding the brain,

16:05.100 --> 16:07.640
but understanding the brain was just his avenue

16:07.640 --> 16:10.200
to exercise ambition.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.780
And if you gave him something else to work on,

16:11.780 --> 16:12.620
he'd work on that.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.360
In fact, he did, he left and he worked on something else.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.640
And I realized he has no passion

16:15.640 --> 16:17.640
for understanding the brain like all the,

16:17.640 --> 16:19.440
I assumed all scientists do,

16:19.440 --> 16:21.060
certainly why I went into it,

16:21.060 --> 16:23.160
but some people's just raw ambition.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.320
It's about winning.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.520
It doesn't even matter what they win,

16:26.520 --> 16:27.760
to which to me is crazy,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.160
but I think that's a shadow that some people explore,

16:30.160 --> 16:32.040
not one I've explored.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.960
I think the shadow parts of us are very important

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
to come to understand.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.920
And look, better to understand them

16:37.920 --> 16:41.380
and know that they're there and work with them

16:41.380 --> 16:44.880
than to not acknowledge their presence

16:44.880 --> 16:47.240
and have them surface in the form of addictions

16:47.240 --> 16:52.080
or behaviors that damage us and other people.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.960
So one of the processes for achieving mental health

16:54.960 --> 16:56.640
is to bring those things to the surface.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.820
So fish the subconscious mind.

16:58.820 --> 17:03.820
Yes, and Paul describes 10 cupboards

17:03.860 --> 17:06.420
that one can look into for exploring the self.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.900
There's the structure of self and the function of self.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.860
Again, this all be spelled out in the series

17:10.860 --> 17:11.700
in a lot of detail,

17:11.700 --> 17:14.780
also in terms of its relational aspect between people,

17:14.780 --> 17:17.100
how to pick good partners and good relationship.

17:17.100 --> 17:20.500
It gets really into this from a very different perspective.

17:20.500 --> 17:21.860
Yeah, fascinating stuff.

17:21.860 --> 17:24.740
I was just sitting there just, I will say this,

17:25.180 --> 17:30.180
that four episode series with Paul is at least to date,

17:30.220 --> 17:33.180
the most important work I've ever been involved in

17:33.180 --> 17:35.500
in all of my career.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.220
Because it's very clear that we are not taught

17:38.220 --> 17:40.140
how to explore our subconscious

17:40.140 --> 17:42.780
and that very few people actually understand how to do that.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.180
Even most psychiatrists,

17:45.220 --> 17:46.620
he mentioned something about psychiatrists.

17:46.620 --> 17:49.300
If you're a cardiothoracic surgeon or something like that

17:49.300 --> 17:51.340
and 50% of your patients die,

17:51.340 --> 17:53.860
you're considered a bad cardiothoracic surgeon.

17:53.860 --> 17:56.540
But with no disrespect to psychiatrists,

17:56.540 --> 17:58.820
there are some excellent psychiatrists out there.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.180
There are also a lot of terrible psychiatrists out there

18:01.180 --> 18:05.300
because unless all of their patients commit suicide

18:05.300 --> 18:06.620
or half commit suicide,

18:06.620 --> 18:09.460
they can treat for a long time without it becoming visible

18:09.460 --> 18:11.180
that they're not so good at their craft.

18:11.180 --> 18:13.460
Now he's superb at his craft.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.180
And I think he would say that, yes, exploring some shadows,

18:17.180 --> 18:19.620
but also just understanding the self,

18:19.620 --> 18:24.620
like really understanding like who am I

18:24.900 --> 18:25.980
and what's important?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.060
What are my ambitions?

18:27.060 --> 18:28.260
What are my strivings?

18:28.260 --> 18:29.780
Again, I'm lifting from some of the things

18:29.780 --> 18:32.660
that he'll describe exactly how to do this.

18:32.660 --> 18:37.660
People do not spend enough time addressing those questions.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.540
And as a consequence,

18:39.540 --> 18:43.340
they discover what resides in their subconscious

18:43.340 --> 18:47.380
through the sometimes bad, hopefully also good,

18:47.380 --> 18:50.380
but manifestations of their actions.

18:50.380 --> 18:55.380
We are driven by this huge 90% of our real estate

18:55.540 --> 18:58.900
that is not visible to our conscious awareness.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.620
And we need to understand that.

19:01.580 --> 19:02.420
I've talked about this before.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.700
I've done therapy twice a week since I was a kid.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.980
I had to as a condition of being let back in school.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.020
I continued, I found a way to either through insurance

19:11.020 --> 19:12.020
or even when I didn't have insurance,

19:12.020 --> 19:14.260
I took an extra job writing for Thrasher magazine

19:14.260 --> 19:16.820
when I was a postdoc so I could pay for therapy

19:16.980 --> 19:18.900
at a discount because I didn't make much money

19:18.900 --> 19:19.980
as a postdoc.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.500
I mean, I think for me,

19:21.500 --> 19:23.420
it's as important as going to the gym.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.180
And people think it's just, you know,

19:25.180 --> 19:27.260
ruminating on problems or getting support.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.100
No, no, no.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.940
If you work with somebody really good,

19:29.940 --> 19:31.540
they're forcing you to ask questions

19:31.540 --> 19:34.580
about who you really are, what you really want.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.300
It's not just about support,

19:37.300 --> 19:38.340
but there should be support.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.260
There should be rapport,

19:39.260 --> 19:42.980
but then it's also there should be insight, right?

19:42.980 --> 19:45.260
Most people who get therapy, they're getting support.

19:45.260 --> 19:46.740
There's rapport,

19:46.740 --> 19:49.540
but insight is not easy to arrive at.

19:49.540 --> 19:52.020
And a really good psychologist or psychiatrist

19:52.020 --> 19:53.820
can help you arrive at deep insights

19:53.820 --> 19:56.620
that transform your entire life.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.140
Well, sometimes when I look inside and I do this often,

20:00.140 --> 20:02.260
you know, exploring who you truly are,

20:02.260 --> 20:04.500
you come to this question,

20:04.500 --> 20:07.660
do I accept once you see parts,

20:07.660 --> 20:11.500
do I accept this or do I fix this?

20:12.460 --> 20:15.420
Is this who you are fundamentally

20:15.420 --> 20:17.500
and it will always be this way

20:17.500 --> 20:19.620
or is this a problem to be fixed?

20:19.620 --> 20:23.060
Like, for example, one of the things,

20:23.060 --> 20:24.620
especially recently, but in general,

20:24.620 --> 20:27.180
over time I've discovered about myself,

20:28.020 --> 20:29.700
probably has roots in childhood,

20:29.700 --> 20:32.620
probably has roots in a lot of things,

20:32.620 --> 20:34.580
is I deeply value loyalty,

20:35.500 --> 20:39.300
maybe more than the average person.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.020
And so when there's disloyalty,

20:41.020 --> 20:43.380
it can be painful to me.

20:43.380 --> 20:44.620
And so this is who I am.

20:44.620 --> 20:48.300
And so do I have to relax a bit?

20:48.300 --> 20:50.060
Do I have to fix this part?

20:50.060 --> 20:51.060
Or is this who you are?

20:51.060 --> 20:53.460
And there's a million, that's one like little.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.140
I think loyalty is a good thing to cling to,

20:55.140 --> 20:58.140
provided that when loyalty is broken,

20:58.140 --> 21:02.620
that it doesn't disrupt too many other areas of your life.

21:02.620 --> 21:05.140
But it depends also on who's disrupting that loyalty.

21:05.140 --> 21:08.460
If it's a coworker versus a romantic partner

21:08.460 --> 21:10.460
versus your exclusive romantic partner,

21:10.460 --> 21:13.380
depending on the structure of your romantic partner life.

21:13.380 --> 21:17.140
I mean, I have always experienced extreme

21:20.500 --> 21:24.260
joy and feelings of safety

21:24.260 --> 21:27.700
and trust in my friendships.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.900
Again, mostly male friendships, but female friendships too,

21:29.900 --> 21:32.220
which is only to say that they were mostly male friendships.

21:32.220 --> 21:34.660
The female friendships have also been very loyal.

21:35.620 --> 21:40.620
So getting backstabbed is not something I'm familiar with.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.540
And yeah, I love being crewed up.

21:45.100 --> 21:45.940
For sure.

21:45.940 --> 21:46.780
And I'm with you.

21:46.780 --> 21:50.100
And you and I are very much have the same values on this.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.900
But that's one little thing.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.140
And then there's many other things

21:53.140 --> 21:55.340
like I'm extremely self-critical.

21:55.340 --> 21:59.780
And I look at myself as I'm regularly very self-critical.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.860
There's a self-critical engine in my brain.

22:01.860 --> 22:03.700
And I've talked to actually Paul about this.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.060
I think on the podcast quite a bit.

22:06.060 --> 22:08.700
And he's saying, this is a really bad thing.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.340
Like you need to fix this.

22:10.340 --> 22:12.540
You need to be able to be regularly

22:12.540 --> 22:15.140
very positive about yourself.

22:15.140 --> 22:16.180
And I kept disagreeing with him.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.380
No, this is like who I am.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.620
Like you, and it seems to work.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.700
Don't mess with the thing that seems to be working.

22:22.700 --> 22:23.580
It's fine.

22:23.580 --> 22:25.860
Like I oscillate between being really grateful

22:25.860 --> 22:27.300
and really self-critical.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.500
But then you have to like figure out what is it?

22:29.500 --> 22:30.980
Maybe there's a deeper root thing.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.940
Maybe there's an insecurity in there somewhere

22:33.940 --> 22:35.380
that has to do with childhood.

22:35.380 --> 22:36.740
And then you're trying to prove something

22:36.740 --> 22:39.180
to somebody from your childhood, this kind of thing.

22:39.180 --> 22:40.980
Well, a couple of things that I think

22:40.980 --> 22:43.460
are hopefully valuable for people here.

22:43.460 --> 22:48.460
One is one way to destroy your life

22:48.700 --> 22:51.100
is to spend time trying to control

22:51.100 --> 22:52.980
your or somebody else's past.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.180
So much of our destructive behavior and thinking

22:58.180 --> 23:01.060
comes from wanting something that we saw

23:01.060 --> 23:04.460
or did or heard to not be true

23:05.580 --> 23:07.260
rather than really working with that

23:07.260 --> 23:09.060
and getting close to what it really was.

23:09.060 --> 23:11.780
And sometimes those things are even traumatic

23:11.780 --> 23:13.780
and we need to really get close to them

23:13.780 --> 23:15.820
and for them to move through us.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.540
And there are a bunch of different ways to do that

23:18.540 --> 23:20.900
with support from others and hopefully,

23:20.900 --> 23:23.260
but sometimes on our own as well.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.700
I don't think we can rewire our deep preferences

23:26.700 --> 23:30.300
and what we find despicable or joyful.

23:30.300 --> 23:33.300
I do think that it's really a question

23:33.300 --> 23:35.260
of what allows us peace.

23:35.260 --> 23:36.780
Like, can you be at peace with the fact

23:36.780 --> 23:39.140
that you're very self-critical and enjoy that,

23:39.140 --> 23:41.620
get some distance from it, have a sense of humor about it,

23:41.620 --> 23:43.140
or is it driving you in a way

23:43.140 --> 23:44.540
that's keeping you awake at night

23:44.540 --> 23:47.660
and forcing you back to the table to do work

23:47.660 --> 23:50.100
in a way that feels self-flagellating

23:50.100 --> 23:51.340
and doesn't feel good?

23:52.540 --> 23:55.020
Can you get that humility and awareness

23:55.020 --> 23:57.660
of your one's flaws?

23:57.660 --> 23:59.340
And I think that that can create,

24:00.420 --> 24:02.260
this word space sounds very new agey,

24:02.260 --> 24:03.100
like get space from it.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.900
It's that you can have a sense of humor

24:04.900 --> 24:07.420
about how neurotic we can all be.

24:07.420 --> 24:10.780
I mean, neurotic isn't actually a bad term

24:10.780 --> 24:12.940
in the classic sense of the psychologists

24:12.940 --> 24:14.700
and psychiatrists, the Freudians,

24:14.700 --> 24:17.260
so that the best case is to be neurotic,

24:17.260 --> 24:19.620
to actually see one's own issues and work with them,

24:19.620 --> 24:22.980
whereas psychotic is the other way to be,

24:22.980 --> 24:24.460
which is obviously not good.

24:24.460 --> 24:27.940
So I think the question whether or not to work on something

24:27.940 --> 24:31.820
or to just accept it as part of ourselves,

24:31.820 --> 24:34.180
I think really depends if we feel like

24:34.180 --> 24:36.020
it's holding us back or not.

24:36.020 --> 24:38.180
And I think you're asking perhaps

24:38.180 --> 24:41.860
the most profound question about being a human,

24:41.860 --> 24:44.860
which is what do you do with your body?

24:44.860 --> 24:45.700
What do you do with your mind?

24:45.700 --> 24:48.940
I mean, it's also a question we started off talking

24:48.940 --> 24:51.780
about fitness a little bit, which is for whatever reason.

24:54.580 --> 24:58.220
Do I need to run an ultra marathon?

24:58.220 --> 24:59.580
I don't feel like I need to.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.820
David Goggins does and does a whole lot more than that.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.380
So that for him, that's important.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.100
For me, it's not important to do that.

25:08.100 --> 25:11.140
I don't think he does it just so he can run the ultras.

25:11.140 --> 25:13.420
There's clearly something else in there for him

25:13.420 --> 25:17.020
and guys like Cam Haines and tremendous respect

25:17.020 --> 25:19.580
for what they do and how they do it.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.100
Does one need to make their body more muscular,

25:24.100 --> 25:27.660
stronger, more endurance, more flexibility?

25:27.660 --> 25:30.020
Do you need to read harder books?

25:30.020 --> 25:32.260
I think doing hard things feels good.

25:33.780 --> 25:35.220
I know it feels good.

25:35.220 --> 25:40.220
I know that the worst way to feel

25:40.220 --> 25:42.980
is when I'm procrastinating and I don't do something

25:42.980 --> 25:44.740
and then whenever I do something and I complete it

25:44.740 --> 25:46.460
and I break through that point where it was hard

25:46.460 --> 25:48.060
and then I'm doing it, at the end,

25:48.060 --> 25:50.060
I actually feel like I was infused

25:50.060 --> 25:52.660
with some sort of super chemical

25:52.660 --> 25:55.380
and who knows if it's probably a cocktail

25:55.380 --> 25:57.220
of endogenously made chemicals,

25:57.220 --> 25:59.620
but I think it is good to do hard things,

25:59.620 --> 26:02.540
but you have to be careful not to destroy your body,

26:02.540 --> 26:03.660
your mind in the process.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.820
And I think it's about whether or not

26:05.820 --> 26:07.820
you can achieve peace.

26:07.820 --> 26:09.340
Can you sleep well at night?

26:09.340 --> 26:11.980
Stress isn't bad if you can sleep well at night.

26:11.980 --> 26:14.660
You can be stressed all day, go, go, go, go, go, go.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.420
And it'll optimize your focus,

26:16.420 --> 26:19.620
but can you fall asleep and stay deeply asleep at night?

26:19.620 --> 26:21.580
Being in a hard relationship.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.700
Something people say, that's not good.

26:24.700 --> 26:25.820
Other people like it.

26:25.820 --> 26:27.660
Can you be at peace in that?

26:27.660 --> 26:32.660
And I think we all have different RPM

26:32.660 --> 26:34.900
that we all kind of idle at different RPM.

26:34.900 --> 26:38.420
And some people are big, mellow Costellos

26:38.420 --> 26:41.220
and others are kind of like need more friction

26:41.220 --> 26:43.460
in order to feel at peace.

26:43.460 --> 26:47.460
But I think ultimately what we want is to feel at peace.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.300
Yeah, I've been through some really low points

26:50.300 --> 26:51.620
over the past couple of years.

26:51.620 --> 26:56.620
And I think the reason could be boiled down to the fact

26:56.900 --> 26:59.740
that I haven't been able to find a place of peace.

26:59.740 --> 27:04.740
A place or people or moments that give deep inner peace.

27:07.700 --> 27:09.180
Yeah, I, you know,

27:11.100 --> 27:13.220
and I think you put it really beautifully.

27:13.220 --> 27:17.300
It's you have to figure out, given who you are,

27:17.340 --> 27:20.260
the various characteristics of your mind,

27:20.260 --> 27:23.340
all the things, all the contents of the cupboards,

27:23.340 --> 27:25.340
how to get space from it.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.740
And ultimately one good representation of that

27:27.740 --> 27:29.460
is to be able to laugh at all of it.

27:29.460 --> 27:31.980
Whatever is going on inside your mind,

27:31.980 --> 27:33.940
to be able to step back and just kind of chuckle

27:33.940 --> 27:36.860
at the beauty and the absurdity of the whole thing.

27:36.860 --> 27:37.980
Yeah, and keep going.

27:37.980 --> 27:40.700
There's this beautiful, as I mentioned,

27:40.700 --> 27:42.500
seems like every podcast lately.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.260
I'm a huge Rancid fan, mostly because I just think

27:45.260 --> 27:47.580
Tim Armstrong's writing is pure poetry

27:47.580 --> 27:50.860
and whether or not you like the music or not, you know,

27:50.860 --> 27:53.060
and he's written on music for a lot of other people too.

27:53.060 --> 27:56.260
He's not, doesn't advertise that much because he's humble.

27:56.260 --> 27:57.100
But I-

27:57.100 --> 27:57.940
And that, by the way,

27:57.940 --> 27:59.460
I went to a show of theirs like 20 years ago.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.780
Oh yeah, I'm going to see them in Boston on September 18th.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.740
I'm literally flying there for,

28:04.740 --> 28:06.900
or I'll take the train from New York.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.620
I'm going to meet a friend of mine named Jim Thiebaud,

28:08.620 --> 28:10.820
who's a guy who owns a lot of companies,

28:10.820 --> 28:12.300
the skateboard industry.

28:12.300 --> 28:13.900
We're meeting there like a couple of little kids

28:13.900 --> 28:14.940
to go see them play.

28:15.660 --> 28:18.620
Amazing people, amazing music.

28:18.620 --> 28:19.460
Very intense.

28:19.460 --> 28:22.500
Very intense, but embodies all the different emotions.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.420
That's why I love it, right?

28:23.420 --> 28:25.220
They have some love songs, they have some hate songs,

28:25.220 --> 28:27.820
they have some, and, but, you know, there's a,

28:27.820 --> 28:31.100
going back to what you said, I think there's a song,

28:31.100 --> 28:34.180
the first song on the Indestructible album, I think it,

28:34.180 --> 28:36.220
there's a, it's sort of,

28:36.220 --> 28:38.100
he's just talking about like shock and disbelief

28:38.100 --> 28:41.180
of discovering things about people that were close to you.

28:41.180 --> 28:44.260
And you know, it's, I won't sing it,

28:44.260 --> 28:46.540
but you know, nor I wouldn't dare.

28:46.540 --> 28:50.060
But, but there's this one lyric where,

28:50.060 --> 28:52.220
that's really stuck in my mind for,

28:52.220 --> 28:54.700
ever since that album came out in 2003,

28:54.700 --> 28:59.700
which is, you know, that nothing's what it seems.

28:59.980 --> 29:01.540
So I just sit here laughing.

29:01.540 --> 29:02.580
I'm going to keep going on.

29:02.580 --> 29:04.220
I can't get distracted.

29:04.220 --> 29:05.300
There is this piece of like,

29:05.300 --> 29:07.460
you got to learn how to push out the disturbing stuff

29:07.460 --> 29:10.220
sometimes and go forward.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.900
And I mean, I remember hearing that lyric

29:13.140 --> 29:14.420
and then writing it down.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.100
And you know, that was a time where my undergraduate advisor,

29:17.100 --> 29:20.620
who was like a, a mentor and a father to me, you know,

29:20.620 --> 29:22.220
blew his head off in the bathtub,

29:23.500 --> 29:25.980
like three weeks before.

29:25.980 --> 29:27.900
And then my graduate advisor,

29:27.900 --> 29:28.980
who I was working for at that time,

29:28.980 --> 29:31.260
who I loved and adored, was really like a mother to me.

29:31.260 --> 29:33.420
I knew her when she was pregnant with her two kids,

29:33.420 --> 29:35.460
died at 50, breast cancer.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.860
And then my post-doc advisor, you know,

29:37.860 --> 29:40.700
first day of work at Stanford as a faculty member,

29:40.700 --> 29:42.260
sitting across the table like this from him,

29:42.260 --> 29:43.500
had a heart attack right in front of me,

29:43.500 --> 29:45.740
died of pancreatic cancer at the end of 2017.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.300
And I remember just thinking like, you know,

29:47.300 --> 29:50.060
going back to that song lyric over and over like,

29:50.060 --> 29:52.260
and where people would, you know,

29:52.260 --> 29:53.700
I haven't had many betrayals in life.

29:53.700 --> 29:55.460
I've had a few, but just thinking like,

29:55.460 --> 29:57.420
or seeing something or learning something about something,

29:57.420 --> 29:59.420
you just like, you can't believe it.

29:59.420 --> 30:04.420
And I mentioned that lyric off that first song,

30:04.420 --> 30:06.420
indestructible on that album,

30:06.420 --> 30:09.940
because it's this, like just the raw emotion of like,

30:09.940 --> 30:11.180
I can't believe this.

30:11.180 --> 30:14.060
What I just saw is so disturbing,

30:15.740 --> 30:17.700
but I have to just keep going forward.

30:17.700 --> 30:20.380
There are certain things that we really do need to push,

30:20.380 --> 30:21.980
not just into our periphery,

30:21.980 --> 30:23.780
but off into the gutter and keep going.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.340
And that's a hard thing to learn how to do.

30:26.340 --> 30:29.340
But if you're going to be functional in life, you have to.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.100
And actually just to get at this issue of do I change

30:32.100 --> 30:34.500
or do I embrace this aspect of self,

30:35.500 --> 30:38.200
about six months, it was April,

30:40.060 --> 30:41.220
of this last year,

30:41.220 --> 30:44.580
I did some intense work around some things

30:44.580 --> 30:46.100
that were really challenging to me.

30:46.100 --> 30:50.300
And I did it alone and it may have involved some medicine.

30:50.300 --> 30:53.780
And I expected to get peace through this.

30:53.780 --> 30:55.020
I was like, I'm going to let go of that.

30:55.020 --> 31:00.020
And I spent 11 hours just getting more and more frustrated

31:00.260 --> 31:02.540
and angry about this thing that I was trying to resolve.

31:02.540 --> 31:06.120
And I was so unbelievably disappointed

31:06.120 --> 31:07.340
that I couldn't get that relief.

31:07.340 --> 31:08.420
And I was like, what is this?

31:08.980 --> 31:11.380
This is not how this is supposed to work.

31:11.380 --> 31:13.280
I'm supposed to feel peace.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.240
The clouds are supposed to lift.

31:15.240 --> 31:20.100
And so a week went by and then another half week went by.

31:20.100 --> 31:22.980
And then someone whose opinion I trust very much,

31:22.980 --> 31:25.300
I explained this to them

31:25.300 --> 31:26.860
because I was getting a little concerned,

31:26.860 --> 31:28.020
like what's going on?

31:28.020 --> 31:29.540
This is worse, not better.

31:29.540 --> 31:31.540
And they said, this is very simple.

31:31.540 --> 31:34.020
You have a giant blind spot,

31:34.020 --> 31:37.540
which is your sense of justice, Andrew,

31:37.540 --> 31:41.760
and your sense of anger are linked like an iron rod.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.180
And you need to relax it.

31:45.060 --> 31:48.500
And as they said that, I felt the anger dissipate.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.580
And so there was something that I think is, it is true.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.060
I have a very strong sense of justice

31:53.060 --> 31:57.120
and my sense of anger, then at least,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.260
was very strongly linked to it.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.300
So it's great to have a sense of justice, right?

32:00.300 --> 32:01.920
I hate to see people wrong.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.760
I absolutely do.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.600
And I'm human.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.780
I'm sure I've wronged people in my life.

32:04.780 --> 32:05.620
I know I have.

32:05.620 --> 32:06.720
They've told me I've tried to apologize

32:06.720 --> 32:08.220
and reconcile where possible.

32:08.220 --> 32:10.620
Still have a lot of work to do.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.600
But where I see injustice,

32:13.600 --> 32:15.680
it draws in my sense of anger in a way

32:15.680 --> 32:18.080
that I think is just eating me up.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.680
And, but it was only in hearing that link

32:20.680 --> 32:22.640
that I wasn't aware of before,

32:22.640 --> 32:24.820
it was in my subconscious, obviously,

32:26.120 --> 32:27.680
did I feel the relaxation.

32:27.680 --> 32:31.880
It wasn't, there's no amount of plant medicine or MDMA

32:31.880 --> 32:35.440
or any kind of, you know, chemical you can take

32:35.440 --> 32:37.360
that's naturally just going to dissipate

32:37.360 --> 32:39.000
what's hard for oneself.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.080
It needs, if one embraces that,

32:41.080 --> 32:43.460
or if one chooses to do it through just talk therapy

32:43.460 --> 32:46.420
or journaling or friends or introspection or all of the above,

32:46.420 --> 32:49.180
there needs to be an awareness

32:49.180 --> 32:51.260
of the things that we're just not aware of.

32:51.260 --> 32:52.720
So I think the answer to your question,

32:52.720 --> 32:56.560
do you embrace or do you fight these aspects of self is,

32:56.560 --> 32:58.400
I think you get in your subconscious

32:58.400 --> 33:00.640
through good work with somebody skilled,

33:00.640 --> 33:03.320
or, and sometimes that involves the tools I just mentioned

33:03.320 --> 33:04.360
in various combinations,

33:04.360 --> 33:06.880
and you figure it out.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.440
You figure out if it's serving you.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.920
Obviously it was not bringing me peace.

33:10.920 --> 33:13.200
It was undermining my sense of justice,

33:13.200 --> 33:15.640
was undermining my sense of peace.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.660
And so in understanding this link,

33:17.660 --> 33:19.200
now I would say that the,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.780
in understanding this link between justice and anger,

33:21.780 --> 33:24.600
now I think it's a little bit more of like,

33:24.600 --> 33:26.520
you know, it's not like a Twizzler stick bendy,

33:26.520 --> 33:28.760
but it's at least it's not like an iron rod.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.560
Like, you know, when I see somebody wrong,

33:30.560 --> 33:33.360
I mean, it used to just like, like immediately,

33:33.400 --> 33:34.780
but you're able to step back.

33:34.780 --> 33:39.780
Now that's like, to me, the ultimate place to reach

33:39.940 --> 33:41.500
is laughter.

33:42.760 --> 33:43.960
I just sit here laughing.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.760
Exactly. That's, that's the lyric.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.040
I like, I can't believe it.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.120
So I just sit here laughing.

33:48.120 --> 33:52.520
Like can't get distracted just at some point,

33:52.520 --> 33:55.520
but the problem I think in just laughing at something,

33:55.520 --> 33:57.520
like that gives you distance.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.760
But the question is, does,

33:59.760 --> 34:02.520
do you stop engaging with it at that point?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.520
Like I experienced this.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.840
I mean, recently I got to see how sometimes I'll see

34:07.840 --> 34:09.560
something that's just like, what?

34:09.560 --> 34:10.400
Like this is crazy.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.320
So I just laugh, but then I continue to engage in it

34:13.320 --> 34:15.940
and it's taking me off course.

34:15.940 --> 34:18.480
And so there is a place where, you know, I mean,

34:18.480 --> 34:20.560
I realize this is probably a kid's show too.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.080
So I want to keep it, you know, G rated,

34:22.080 --> 34:24.440
but at some point for certain things,

34:24.440 --> 34:27.840
it makes sense to go fuck that.

34:27.840 --> 34:31.140
But also laugh at yourself for saying fuck that.

34:31.140 --> 34:32.440
Yeah. And then move on.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.400
So the question is, do you get stuck or do you move on?

34:35.400 --> 34:36.400
Sure.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.280
Sure. But like there's a lightness of being

34:38.280 --> 34:39.240
that comes with laughter.

34:39.240 --> 34:41.040
I mean, I've gotten, I guess, you know,

34:41.040 --> 34:43.160
I spent the day with Elon today.

34:43.160 --> 34:45.220
He just gave me this burnt hair.

34:45.220 --> 34:46.060
Do you know what this is?

34:46.060 --> 34:46.960
I have no idea.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.920
I'm sure there's actually,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.660
there's, it should be a human lab episode on this.

34:50.660 --> 34:53.360
It's a cologne that's burnt hair.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.360
And it's like supposedly a really intense smell.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.240
And it is, to please, it's not going to leave your nose.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.080
That's okay.

34:59.080 --> 34:59.920
Well, that's okay.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.640
I'll take a gentle, I'll whiff it as if I were

35:01.800 --> 35:02.640
a chemical in the lab.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.680
You have to actually spray it on yourself.

35:03.680 --> 35:04.600
Cause I don't know if you can.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.400
So I'm reading an amazing book

35:07.400 --> 35:09.240
called An Immense World by Ed Yong.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.880
He won a Pulitzer for We Contain Multitudes

35:11.880 --> 35:12.880
or something like that.

35:12.880 --> 35:14.900
I think it's the title of the other book.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.880
And the first chapter is all about olfaction

35:16.880 --> 35:20.200
and the incredible power that olfaction has.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.880
That smells terrible.

35:21.880 --> 35:22.720
I don't even need to.

35:22.720 --> 35:23.960
And it doesn't leave you.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.560
For those listening, it doesn't quite smell terrible.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.480
It's just intense and it stays with you.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.280
This to me represents like just laughing

35:34.280 --> 35:35.680
at the absurdity of it all.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.800
So I have to ask, so you were rolling jiu-jitsu?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.160
Yeah, we're training jiu-jitsu, yeah.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.680
So is that fight between Elon

35:42.680 --> 35:45.080
and Zuck actually going to happen?

35:45.080 --> 35:47.440
I think Elon is a huge believer of this idea

35:47.440 --> 35:51.560
of the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.

35:51.560 --> 35:56.440
And he almost like, there is almost the sense

35:56.440 --> 35:58.640
that there's not a free will

35:58.640 --> 36:02.040
and the universe has a kind of deterministic

36:02.040 --> 36:06.400
gravitational field pulling towards the most fun.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.000
And he's just the player in that game.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.880
So from that perspective, I think it seems like

36:11.880 --> 36:14.280
something like that is inevitable.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.440
Like a little scrap in the parking lot

36:16.440 --> 36:17.840
of Facebook or something like that?

36:17.840 --> 36:18.680
Exactly.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.560
Sorry, Meta.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.040
But it looks like they're training for real

36:21.040 --> 36:23.400
and Zuck has competed, right, in jiu-jitsu.

36:23.400 --> 36:27.200
So I think he is approaching it as a sport.

36:27.240 --> 36:32.040
Elon is approaching it as a spectacle.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.920
And I mean, the way he talks about it,

36:33.920 --> 36:35.000
he's a huge fan of history.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.440
He talks about all the warriors

36:36.440 --> 36:38.000
that have fought throughout history.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.040
If you look, he wants to really do it at the Coliseum.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.840
And the Coliseum is, for 400 years,

36:44.840 --> 36:47.360
there's so much great writing about this.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.560
I think over 400,000 people have died

36:50.560 --> 36:52.640
in the Coliseum, gladiators.

36:52.640 --> 36:56.960
So this is this historic place that sheds so much blood,

36:57.520 --> 37:01.640
so much fear, so much anticipation of battle, all of this.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.200
So he loves this kind of spectacle

37:04.200 --> 37:08.880
and also the meme of it, the hilarious absurdity of it,

37:08.880 --> 37:12.920
the two tech CEOs battling it out on sand

37:12.920 --> 37:16.160
in a place where gladiators fought to the death

37:16.160 --> 37:19.360
and then bears and lions ate prisoners

37:19.360 --> 37:21.320
as part of the execution process.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.720
Well, it's also gonna be an instance where Mark Zuckerberg

37:24.720 --> 37:27.680
and Elon Musk has changed bodily fluids.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.240
They bleed, this one, things about fighting, you know?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.840
I think it was in that book, it's a great book,

37:32.840 --> 37:35.760
Fighter's Heart, where he talks about the intimacy

37:35.760 --> 37:37.160
of sparring.

37:37.160 --> 37:38.640
I only rolled Jiu-Jitsu with you once,

37:38.640 --> 37:40.880
but there was a period of time where I boxed

37:40.880 --> 37:43.080
and which I don't recommend.

37:43.080 --> 37:46.040
I got hit, I hit some guys and I definitely got hit back.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.760
I'd spar on Wednesday nights when I lived on San Diego.

37:50.760 --> 37:54.560
And you know, when you spar with somebody,

37:55.520 --> 37:57.120
even if they hurt you, especially if they hurt you,

37:57.120 --> 37:59.040
you see that person afterwards

37:59.040 --> 38:01.000
and there's an intimacy, right?

38:01.000 --> 38:03.440
It was in that book, Fighter's Heart, where he explains,

38:03.440 --> 38:05.120
you know, you're exchanging bodily fluids

38:05.120 --> 38:06.600
with a stranger, right?

38:06.600 --> 38:11.080
And you're in your primitive mind

38:11.080 --> 38:13.800
and so there's an intimacy there that persists.

38:13.800 --> 38:18.320
You go together through a process of fear, anxiety.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.640
Yeah, when they get you, you nod.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.360
I mean, you watch somebody, you catch somebody,

38:22.360 --> 38:23.520
not so much in professional fighting,

38:23.520 --> 38:26.080
but if people are sparring and they catch you,

38:26.080 --> 38:27.760
you acknowledge that they caught you.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.760
Like, you got me there.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.920
And on the flip side of that, so we trained

38:31.920 --> 38:34.680
and then after that we played Diablo 4.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.160
I don't know what that is.

38:36.160 --> 38:37.640
I don't play video games, sorry.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.480
But it's a video game.

38:38.480 --> 38:43.080
So it's like, it's a pretty intense combat in the video.

38:43.080 --> 38:46.120
You're fighting like demons and dragons.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.320
Last video game I played was Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

38:48.320 --> 38:49.160
There you go, that's pretty cool.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.040
I met him recently, went on his podcast.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.200
You went, you went, wait.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.040
It hasn't come out yet.

38:53.880 --> 38:57.520
Yeah, I asked Mike, kids are great.

38:57.520 --> 38:59.720
They came in, they're super smart kids.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.280
Goodness gracious, they ask great questions.

39:03.760 --> 39:06.440
Asked Mike what he did with the piece of a Vander's ear

39:06.440 --> 39:08.360
that he bit off.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.200
Did he remember?

39:09.200 --> 39:11.560
Yeah, he's like, get back to him.

39:11.560 --> 39:12.880
Here you go.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.040
Sorry about that.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.600
He sells edibles that are in the shape of ears

39:16.600 --> 39:18.040
with a little bite out of it.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.480
Yeah, his life has been incredible.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.840
He's, and I met, yeah, his family,

39:25.840 --> 39:29.000
you get the sense that they're really a great family.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.200
They're really-

39:30.200 --> 39:31.280
Mike Tyson?

39:31.280 --> 39:33.480
That's a heck of a journey right there, of a man.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.280
Yeah, my now friend Tim Armstrong, like I said,

39:36.280 --> 39:38.000
Lee Zimmer from Ransy, he put it best.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.320
He said, you know, that Mike Tyson's life

39:40.320 --> 39:42.440
is, you know, Shakespearean.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.960
Down, up, down, up, and just the arcs of his life

39:47.960 --> 39:52.280
are just like, sort of an only in America kind of tale too.

39:52.280 --> 39:53.360
So speaking of Shakespeare,

39:53.360 --> 39:55.400
I've recently gotten to know Neri Oxman,

39:55.400 --> 39:58.280
who's this incredible scientist

39:58.280 --> 40:01.480
that works at the intersection of nature and engineering.

40:01.480 --> 40:06.480
And she reminded me of this Anna Akhmatova line.

40:07.960 --> 40:09.640
This is this great Soviet poet

40:09.640 --> 40:13.400
that I really love from over a century ago,

40:13.400 --> 40:16.160
that each of our lives is a Shakespearean drama

40:16.160 --> 40:17.920
raised to the thousand degree.

40:18.920 --> 40:23.000
So I have to ask, why do you think humans are attracted

40:23.000 --> 40:26.160
to this kind of Shakespearean drama?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.760
Is there some aspect, we've been talking about

40:30.760 --> 40:35.200
the subconscious mind that pulls us towards the drama,

40:35.200 --> 40:38.080
even though the place of mental health is peace?

40:39.360 --> 40:41.000
Yes, and yes.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.280
Do you have some of that?

40:42.280 --> 40:44.080
Draw towards drama?

40:45.280 --> 40:46.480
Yeah.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.160
Yes, I mean, right.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.280
If I look at the empirical data,

40:49.280 --> 40:51.680
I mean, I think about who I chose to work for

40:51.680 --> 40:52.600
as an undergraduate, right?

40:52.600 --> 40:54.840
I was barely finished high school,

40:54.840 --> 40:57.640
finally get to college, barely.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.520
This is really embarrassing and not something to aspire to.

41:01.520 --> 41:05.400
I was thrown out of the dorms for fighting,

41:05.400 --> 41:07.520
barely passed my classes.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.320
The girlfriend and I split up.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.720
I mean, I was living in a squad,

41:10.720 --> 41:13.800
got into a big fight, was getting in trouble with the law.

41:13.800 --> 41:15.560
Eventually got my act together, go back to school,

41:15.560 --> 41:16.600
start working for somebody.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.360
Who do I choose to work for?

41:18.360 --> 41:20.640
A guy who's an ex-Navy guy,

41:20.640 --> 41:24.080
who smokes cigarettes in the fume hood, drinks coffee,

41:24.080 --> 41:26.400
and we're injecting rats with MDMA.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.360
And I was drawn to the personality, his energy,

41:30.360 --> 41:32.640
but he was a great scientist,

41:32.640 --> 41:35.040
worked out a lot on thermal regulation in the brain

41:35.040 --> 41:37.280
and more.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.920
Go to graduate school, I'm working for somebody

41:40.920 --> 41:45.120
and decide that working in her laboratory

41:45.120 --> 41:46.000
wasn't quite right for me.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.240
So I'm literally sneaking into the laboratory next door

41:48.240 --> 41:49.800
and working for the woman next door

41:49.800 --> 41:51.680
because I liked the relationships that she had

41:51.680 --> 41:53.120
to a certain set of questions.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.000
And she was kind of a quirky person.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.640
So drawn to drama, but drawn to, I like characters.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.680
I like people that have texture.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.800
And I'm not drawn to raw ambition.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.000
I'm drawn to people that seem to have a real passion

42:06.000 --> 42:08.480
for what they do and a uniqueness to them

42:08.480 --> 42:12.560
that I, you know, you can kind of, not kind of,

42:12.560 --> 42:13.480
I'll just say how it is.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.760
I can feel their heart for what they do

42:15.760 --> 42:19.320
and I'm drawn to that, like, and that can be good.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.520
The same reason I went to work for Ben Barris

42:22.520 --> 42:25.880
as a postdoc, it wasn't because he was the first transgender

42:25.880 --> 42:27.400
member of the National Academy of Sciences.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.600
That was just a feature of who he was.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.360
I loved how he loved glia.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.920
He would talk about these cells

42:32.920 --> 42:34.720
like they were the most enchanting things

42:34.720 --> 42:35.960
that he'd ever seen in his life.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.280
And I was like, this is like the biggest nerd I've ever met

42:38.280 --> 42:39.720
and I love him.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.680
I think we're, I'm drawn to that.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.880
This is another thing that Conti makes,

42:44.880 --> 42:46.560
elaborates on quite a bit more

42:46.560 --> 42:48.440
in the series on mental health coming out,

42:48.440 --> 42:50.720
but there are different drives within us.

42:50.720 --> 42:53.920
There's this, there are aggressive drives,

42:53.920 --> 42:57.560
not always for fighting, but for intense interaction.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.240
I mean, look at Twitter, look at some of the,

42:59.240 --> 43:02.840
look at people clearly have an aggressive drive.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.680
There's also a pleasure drive.

43:04.680 --> 43:07.480
Some people also have a strong pleasure drive.

43:07.480 --> 43:09.440
They want to experience pleasure through food,

43:09.440 --> 43:13.280
through sex, through friendship, through adventure,

43:13.280 --> 43:16.080
but I think the Shakespearean drama

43:16.080 --> 43:18.680
is the drama of the different drives

43:18.680 --> 43:21.560
in different ratios in different people.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.760
I know somebody and she's incredibly kind,

43:24.760 --> 43:27.400
has an extremely high pleasure drive,

43:27.400 --> 43:30.640
loves taking great care of herself and people around her

43:30.640 --> 43:32.720
through food and through retreats

43:32.720 --> 43:33.560
and through all these things

43:33.560 --> 43:37.600
and makes spaces beautiful everywhere she goes

43:37.600 --> 43:39.120
and is gifts these things

43:39.120 --> 43:42.160
that are just so unbelievably feminine

43:42.160 --> 43:44.320
and incredible these gifts to people

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
and the kind and thoughtful about what they like.

43:46.320 --> 43:50.880
And then, but I would say very little aggressive drive

43:51.960 --> 43:53.080
from my read.

43:53.080 --> 43:54.080
And then I know other people

43:54.080 --> 43:56.200
who just have a ton of aggressive drive

43:56.200 --> 43:57.560
and very little pleasure drive.

43:57.560 --> 44:00.480
And I think, so there's this alchemy that exists

44:00.480 --> 44:02.640
where people have these things in different ratios

44:02.640 --> 44:07.080
and then you blend in the differences in the chromosomes

44:07.080 --> 44:08.280
and differences in hormones

44:08.280 --> 44:09.600
and differences in personal history

44:09.600 --> 44:12.120
and what you end up with is a species

44:12.120 --> 44:17.120
that creates incredible recipes of drama,

44:17.200 --> 44:21.320
but also peace, also relief from drama, contentment.

44:21.320 --> 44:23.840
I mean, I realize this isn't the exact topic

44:23.840 --> 44:28.000
of the question, but someone I know very dearly,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.880
actually an ex-girlfriend of mine, long-term partner,

44:30.880 --> 44:33.320
mine sent me something recently

44:33.320 --> 44:34.400
and I think it hit the nail on the head,

44:34.400 --> 44:37.760
which is that ideally for a man,

44:37.760 --> 44:41.960
they eventually settle where they find and feel peace,

44:41.960 --> 44:43.240
where they feel peaceful,

44:43.240 --> 44:45.480
where they can be themselves and feel peaceful.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.680
Now, I'm sure there's a equivalent

44:47.680 --> 44:50.160
or a mirror image of that for women,

44:50.160 --> 44:53.000
but this particular post that she sent was about men.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.320
And I totally agree.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.480
And so it isn't always that we're seeking friction,

44:58.480 --> 45:01.800
but for periods of our life, we seek friction, drama,

45:01.800 --> 45:05.200
adventure, excitement, fights,

45:07.200 --> 45:09.160
and doing hard, hard things.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.360
And then I think at some point,

45:11.360 --> 45:13.560
I'm certainly coming to this point now where it's like,

45:13.560 --> 45:15.160
yeah, that's all great.

45:15.160 --> 45:17.560
And checked a lot of boxes,

45:17.560 --> 45:18.680
but had a lot of close calls,

45:18.680 --> 45:20.680
flew really close to the sun on a lot of things

45:20.680 --> 45:23.680
with life and limb and heart and spirit.

45:23.680 --> 45:28.160
And some people close to us didn't make it.

45:28.160 --> 45:30.000
And sometimes not making it means

45:30.000 --> 45:31.680
the career they wanted went off a cliff

45:32.520 --> 45:33.960
or their health went off a cliff

45:33.960 --> 45:35.480
or their life went off a cliff.

45:35.480 --> 45:39.640
But I think that there's also the Shakespearean drama

45:39.640 --> 45:42.520
of the characters that exit the play

45:42.520 --> 45:44.960
and are living their lives happily in the backdrop.

45:44.960 --> 45:47.320
It just doesn't make for as much entertainment.

45:49.400 --> 45:52.680
That's one other thing that's a benefit.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.640
You could say it's a benefit of getting older

45:54.640 --> 45:58.840
is finding the Shakespearean drama less appealing

45:58.880 --> 46:01.760
or finding the joy in the peace.

46:01.760 --> 46:02.680
Yeah, definitely.

46:02.680 --> 46:05.760
I mean, I think that there's real peace with age.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.600
I think the other thing is this notion

46:07.600 --> 46:11.040
of checking boxes is a real thing for me anyway.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.360
I have a morning meditation that I do.

46:14.560 --> 46:16.520
Well, I wake up now and get my sunlight,

46:16.520 --> 46:17.920
I hydrate, I use the bathroom,

46:17.920 --> 46:19.920
I do all the things that I talk about.

46:20.800 --> 46:23.480
I've started a practice of prayer in the last year,

46:23.480 --> 46:25.680
which is new-ish for me,

46:25.680 --> 46:27.080
which is, we could talk about it.

46:27.080 --> 46:27.920
In the morning?

46:28.080 --> 46:29.240
Can you talk about it a little bit?

46:29.240 --> 46:30.440
Sure, yeah.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.520
And then I have a meditation that I do

46:33.520 --> 46:35.360
that actually is where I think through

46:35.360 --> 46:37.200
what the different roles that I play.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.320
So I start very basic.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.200
I say, okay, I'm an animal.

46:42.200 --> 46:46.680
We are biologically animals, human.

46:48.200 --> 46:51.480
I'm a man, I'm a scientist, I'm a teacher,

46:51.480 --> 46:53.320
I'm a friend, I'm a brother, I'm a son.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.640
I go through this, I have this list

46:54.640 --> 46:56.920
and I think about the different roles that I have

46:56.920 --> 47:00.160
and the roles that I still want in my life going forward

47:00.160 --> 47:02.160
that I haven't yet fulfilled.

47:02.160 --> 47:04.480
It just takes me, it's sort of an inventory

47:04.480 --> 47:06.360
of where I've been, where I'm at,

47:06.360 --> 47:08.000
and where I'm going, as they say.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.320
And I don't know why I do it,

47:10.320 --> 47:12.360
but I started doing it this last year,

47:12.360 --> 47:16.200
I think because it helps me understand

47:16.200 --> 47:19.240
just how many different contexts I have to exist in

47:19.240 --> 47:22.040
and remind myself that there's still more

47:22.040 --> 47:24.400
that I haven't done that I'm excited about.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.880
So within each of those contexts,

47:25.880 --> 47:30.120
there's things that you want to accomplish to define that.

47:30.120 --> 47:32.840
Yeah, and I'm ambitious, so I think I'm a brother.

47:32.840 --> 47:35.920
I have an older sister and I love her tremendously.

47:35.920 --> 47:39.320
And I think I wanna be the best brother I can be to her,

47:39.320 --> 47:40.480
which means maybe a call,

47:40.480 --> 47:44.240
maybe just we do an annual trip together for our birthdays,

47:44.240 --> 47:45.200
our birthdays are close together,

47:45.200 --> 47:46.520
we always go to New York for our birthdays

47:46.520 --> 47:48.400
and we've gone for the last three, four years.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.880
Really reminding myself of that role,

47:49.880 --> 47:50.880
not because I'll forget,

47:50.880 --> 47:52.040
but because I have all these other roles

47:52.040 --> 47:53.200
I'll get pulled into.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.800
I say the first one, I'm an animal,

47:56.720 --> 47:57.600
because I have to remember that I have a body

47:57.600 --> 47:59.920
that needs care, like any of us.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.880
I need sleep, I need food, I need hydration.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.200
I need that I'm human,

48:03.200 --> 48:07.600
that the brain of a human is marvelously complex,

48:07.600 --> 48:12.200
but also marvelously self-defeating at times.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.800
And so I've been thinking about these things

48:13.800 --> 48:15.160
in the context of the different roles.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.120
And the whole thing takes about four or five minutes

48:17.120 --> 48:19.880
and I just find it brings me a certain amount of clarity

48:19.880 --> 48:22.200
that then allows me to ratchet into the day.

48:22.200 --> 48:25.960
The prayer piece, I think I've been reluctant

48:25.960 --> 48:30.120
to talk about until now,

48:30.120 --> 48:33.920
because I don't believe in pushing religion on people.

48:33.920 --> 48:38.600
And I think that, and I'm not,

48:39.680 --> 48:41.000
it's a highly individual thing.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.640
And I do believe that one can be an atheist and still pray

48:44.640 --> 48:45.920
or agnostic and still pray.

48:45.920 --> 48:50.760
But for me, it really came about through understanding

48:50.760 --> 48:55.520
that there are certain aspects of myself

48:55.520 --> 49:00.120
that I just couldn't resolve on my own.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.760
And no matter how much therapy, no matter how much,

49:03.760 --> 49:04.800
and I haven't done a lot of it,

49:04.800 --> 49:07.000
but no matter how much plant medicine

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
or other forms of medicine or exercise or podcasting

49:12.000 --> 49:14.960
or science or friendship or any of that,

49:14.960 --> 49:17.760
I was just not going to resolve.

49:17.760 --> 49:22.760
And so I started this because someone close to me said,

49:26.600 --> 49:31.120
a male friend said, you know, prayer is powerful.

49:31.120 --> 49:32.320
And I said, well, how?

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
And he said, I don't know how,

49:33.320 --> 49:38.320
but if you can allow you to get outside yourself,

49:38.600 --> 49:41.960
let you give up control and at the same time take control.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.080
I don't even like saying take control,

49:43.080 --> 49:46.560
but the whole notion is that, again, forgive me,

49:46.560 --> 49:48.040
but there's no other way to say it.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.400
The whole notion is that, you know,

49:49.400 --> 49:52.480
like God works through us, whatever God is to you.

49:52.480 --> 49:56.560
He, him, her, whatever, life force, nature,

49:56.560 --> 49:57.920
whatever it is to you, right?

49:57.920 --> 49:59.520
That it works through us.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.340
And so I do a prayer, I'll just describe it,

50:01.340 --> 50:06.340
where I ask, I make an ask to help remove my defects,

50:08.480 --> 50:09.560
my character defects.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.720
I pray to God to help remove my character defects

50:12.720 --> 50:16.880
so that I can show up better in all the roles of my life

50:16.880 --> 50:18.960
and do good work, like to,

50:18.960 --> 50:21.480
which for me is learning and teaching,

50:21.480 --> 50:22.800
learning and teaching.

50:22.800 --> 50:24.440
And so you might say, well,

50:24.440 --> 50:25.880
how is that different than a meditation?

50:25.880 --> 50:28.740
Well, I'm acknowledging that there is something

50:28.740 --> 50:31.960
that bigger than me, bigger than nature,

50:31.960 --> 50:32.800
as I understand it,

50:32.800 --> 50:35.720
that I cannot understand or control, nor do I want to.

50:35.720 --> 50:37.680
And I'm just giving over to that.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.160
And does that make me less of a scientist?

50:40.160 --> 50:41.820
I sure as hell hope not.

50:41.820 --> 50:43.260
I certainly know,

50:43.260 --> 50:45.260
there's the head of our neurosciences

50:45.260 --> 50:46.900
at Stanford until recently.

50:48.100 --> 50:49.380
You should talk to him directly about it.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.380
Bill Newsom has talked about his religious life.

50:52.380 --> 50:56.460
For me, it's really a way of getting outside myself

50:56.460 --> 50:59.700
and then understanding how I fit into this bigger picture.

50:59.700 --> 51:02.620
And it's, and the character defects part is real, right?

51:02.620 --> 51:04.860
I'm a human, I have defects like,

51:04.860 --> 51:08.860
I got a lot of flaws in me, like anybody, but,

51:09.860 --> 51:13.700
and trying to acknowledge them

51:13.700 --> 51:17.660
and asking for help in removing them, not magically,

51:17.660 --> 51:21.580
but through right action, through my right action.

51:21.580 --> 51:23.140
So I do that every morning.

51:23.140 --> 51:26.860
And I have to say that it's helped, it's helped a lot.

51:26.860 --> 51:28.540
It's helped me be better to myself,

51:28.540 --> 51:30.520
be better at other people.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.780
I still make mistakes,

51:33.180 --> 51:36.780
but it's becoming a bigger, bigger part of my life.

51:36.780 --> 51:38.660
And I never thought I'd talk like this.

51:39.500 --> 51:44.500
But I think it's clear to me that

51:45.980 --> 51:50.860
if we don't believe in something,

51:50.860 --> 51:53.780
again, doesn't have to be traditional standardized religion,

51:53.780 --> 51:56.980
but if we don't believe in something bigger than ourselves,

51:56.980 --> 52:01.140
we at some level will self-destruct.

52:02.180 --> 52:03.700
I really think so.

52:03.700 --> 52:07.260
And it's powerful in a way that all the other stuff,

52:07.260 --> 52:09.860
meditation and all the tools is not

52:09.860 --> 52:13.460
because it's really operating at a much deeper

52:13.460 --> 52:14.940
and bigger level.

52:14.940 --> 52:19.940
And, yeah, I think that's all I can talk about it,

52:22.260 --> 52:24.900
mostly because I'm still working out,

52:24.900 --> 52:26.860
the scientist in me wants to understand how it works

52:26.860 --> 52:27.700
and I want to understand.

52:27.700 --> 52:29.220
And the point is to just go,

52:32.260 --> 52:33.940
for lack of a better language for it,

52:33.940 --> 52:37.180
there's higher power than me and what I can control.

52:38.140 --> 52:40.740
I'm giving up control on certain things.

52:40.740 --> 52:44.180
And somehow that restores a sense of agency

52:44.180 --> 52:47.060
for right action, better action.

52:47.060 --> 52:50.220
I think perhaps a part of that is just the humility

52:50.220 --> 52:53.020
that comes with acknowledging there's something bigger

52:53.020 --> 52:54.340
and more powerful than you.

52:54.340 --> 52:56.580
And then you can't control everything.

52:56.580 --> 52:59.900
I mean, you go through life as a hard-driving person,

52:59.900 --> 53:01.020
forward center of mass.

53:01.020 --> 53:03.140
I remember being that way since I was little.

53:03.140 --> 53:05.380
It's like in Legos, I'm like, oh, Legos.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.580
Learning about medieval weapons

53:07.580 --> 53:09.180
and then giving lectures about it in class

53:09.180 --> 53:10.860
when I was five or six years old.

53:10.860 --> 53:12.100
We're learning about tropical fish

53:12.100 --> 53:14.140
and cataloging all of them at the store

53:14.140 --> 53:17.660
and then organizing it and making my dad drive me

53:17.660 --> 53:19.100
or my mom drive me to some fish store

53:19.100 --> 53:20.180
and then spending all my time there

53:20.180 --> 53:22.380
until they throw me out, all of that.

53:22.380 --> 53:25.660
But I also remember my entire life,

53:25.660 --> 53:29.100
I would secretly pray when things were good

53:29.100 --> 53:29.940
and things weren't good,

53:29.940 --> 53:31.180
but mostly when things weren't good

53:31.180 --> 53:32.940
because it's important to pray.

53:32.940 --> 53:35.340
For me, it's important to pray each morning regardless.

53:36.340 --> 53:38.860
But when things weren't right,

53:38.860 --> 53:39.780
I couldn't make sense of them.

53:39.780 --> 53:40.740
I would secretly pray,

53:40.740 --> 53:43.660
but I felt kind of ashamed of that for whatever reason.

53:43.660 --> 53:46.260
And then it was once in college, I distinctly remember.

53:46.260 --> 53:49.420
I was having a hard time with a number of things

53:50.540 --> 53:53.780
and I took a run down to Sands Beach.

53:53.780 --> 53:54.820
It was UC Santa Barbara.

53:54.820 --> 53:56.700
And I remember I just, I was like,

53:56.700 --> 54:00.260
I don't know if I even have the right to do this,

54:00.260 --> 54:01.300
but I'm just praying.

54:01.300 --> 54:06.260
I just prayed for the ability

54:06.260 --> 54:09.420
to be as brutally honest with myself

54:09.420 --> 54:11.340
and with other people as I possibly could be

54:11.340 --> 54:14.380
about a particular situation I was in at that time.

54:14.380 --> 54:16.420
I mean, I think now it's probably safe to say

54:16.420 --> 54:17.380
I'd gone off to college

54:17.380 --> 54:18.460
because of a high school girlfriend.

54:18.460 --> 54:21.580
We had, essentially she was my family,

54:21.580 --> 54:23.860
frankly more than my biological family was

54:23.860 --> 54:25.100
at a certain stage of life.

54:25.100 --> 54:27.180
And we'd reached a point where we were diverging

54:27.180 --> 54:29.340
and it was incredibly painful.

54:29.420 --> 54:31.820
It was like losing everything I had.

54:31.820 --> 54:33.020
And it was like, what do I do?

54:33.020 --> 54:34.020
How do I manage this?

54:34.020 --> 54:35.700
Do I, you know, I was ready to quit

54:35.700 --> 54:38.340
and join the fire service just to support us

54:38.340 --> 54:39.620
so that we could move forward.

54:39.620 --> 54:42.780
And, you know, it was just,

54:42.780 --> 54:45.900
but praying, just saying, I can't figure this out on my own.

54:45.900 --> 54:48.020
It's sort of like, I can't figure this out on my own.

54:48.020 --> 54:49.020
And how frustrating that is,

54:49.020 --> 54:51.180
no number of friends could tell me

54:51.180 --> 54:53.300
and inner wisdom couldn't tell me.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.180
And eventually it led me to the right answers.

54:55.180 --> 54:57.900
And she and I are friendly friends to this day.

54:57.900 --> 55:01.380
She's happily married with a child and we're on good terms.

55:01.380 --> 55:06.380
But I think, you know, it's a scary thing,

55:08.500 --> 55:10.780
but it's the best thing when you,

55:10.780 --> 55:11.860
I can't control all of this.

55:11.860 --> 55:14.860
And asking for help, I think is also the piece.

55:14.860 --> 55:16.300
You're not asking for some magic hand

55:16.300 --> 55:17.140
to come down and take care of it.

55:17.140 --> 55:20.540
You're asking for the help to come through you, right?

55:20.540 --> 55:23.540
So that your body is used to do these right works,

55:23.540 --> 55:24.500
right action.

55:24.500 --> 55:27.540
Isn't it interesting that this secret thing

55:27.580 --> 55:28.700
that you're almost embarrassed by

55:28.700 --> 55:31.020
that you did it as a child is something you,

55:31.020 --> 55:32.820
that's another thing you do as you get older,

55:32.820 --> 55:35.100
is you realize like those things are part of you

55:35.100 --> 55:37.020
and it's actually a beautiful thing.

55:37.020 --> 55:38.380
A lot of the content of the podcast

55:38.380 --> 55:40.820
is deep academic content.

55:40.820 --> 55:43.180
And we talk about everything from, you know,

55:43.180 --> 55:45.740
eating disorders to bipolar disorder to depression,

55:45.740 --> 55:47.020
you know, a lot of different topics,

55:47.020 --> 55:49.700
but the tools are the protocols, as we say, right?

55:49.700 --> 55:51.660
The sunlight viewing and all the rest.

55:52.860 --> 55:54.100
You know, a lot of that stuff is just stuff

55:54.100 --> 55:56.420
I wish I had known when I was in graduate school.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.260
If I'd known to go outside every once in a while

55:58.260 --> 56:01.740
and get some sunlight, not just stay in the lab,

56:01.740 --> 56:03.820
I would have, you know, I might not have hit

56:03.820 --> 56:06.500
like a really tough round of depression

56:06.500 --> 56:09.140
when I was a postdoc and working twice as hard.

56:09.140 --> 56:11.300
And, you know, when my body would break down

56:11.300 --> 56:13.420
or I'd get sick a lot, I don't get sick much anymore.

56:13.420 --> 56:15.300
Occasionally, about once every 18 months to two years,

56:15.300 --> 56:16.740
I get a, you know, I'll get something.

56:16.740 --> 56:20.900
But, you know, I used to break my foot skateboarding

56:20.900 --> 56:21.740
all the time.

56:21.740 --> 56:22.700
I couldn't understand what's wrong with my body.

56:22.700 --> 56:23.540
I'm getting injured.

56:23.540 --> 56:24.460
I can't do what everyone else can.

56:24.460 --> 56:25.700
You know, I developed more slowly,

56:25.700 --> 56:27.140
I had a long arc of puberty.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.980
But I, so that was part of it.

56:30.980 --> 56:32.340
I was still developing, but, you know,

56:32.340 --> 56:34.300
how to get your body stronger, how to build endurance.

56:34.300 --> 56:36.700
Like no one told me, the information wasn't there.

56:36.700 --> 56:38.520
So a lot of what I put out there is the information

56:38.520 --> 56:39.820
that I wish I had had.

56:39.820 --> 56:42.540
Because once I had it, I was like, wow,

56:42.540 --> 56:44.340
like A, this stuff really works.

56:44.340 --> 56:46.540
B, it's grounded in something real.

56:46.540 --> 56:49.620
You know, sometimes certain protocols are a combination

56:49.620 --> 56:53.060
of, you know, animal, human and animal and human studies,

56:53.060 --> 56:54.020
sometimes clinical trials,

56:54.020 --> 56:57.900
sometimes there's some mechanistic conjecture for some,

56:57.900 --> 56:59.660
not all, I always make clear which.

56:59.660 --> 57:04.660
But in the end, like figuring out how things work

57:05.080 --> 57:08.060
so that we can be happier, healthier, more productive,

57:08.060 --> 57:11.900
suffer less, like reduce the suffering of the world.

57:11.900 --> 57:16.900
And I think that, well, I'll just say thank you

57:17.380 --> 57:22.100
and for asking about the prayer piece.

57:23.980 --> 57:27.060
Again, I'm not pushing or even encouraging it on anyone.

57:27.060 --> 57:29.800
I've just found it to be tremendously useful for me.

57:32.140 --> 57:34.940
You know, I mean, about prayer in general,

57:34.940 --> 57:38.220
you said information and figuring out how to get stronger,

57:38.220 --> 57:41.260
healthier, smarter, all those kinds of things.

57:41.260 --> 57:45.120
A part of me believes that deeply, you know,

57:45.120 --> 57:49.380
you can gain a lot of knowledge and wisdom through learning.

57:49.380 --> 57:53.220
But a part of me believes that all the wisdom I need

57:53.220 --> 57:57.900
was there when I was 11 and 12 years old.

57:57.900 --> 58:00.040
And then it got cluttered over.

58:00.040 --> 58:03.380
Well, listen, I can't wait for you and Conti to talk again,

58:03.380 --> 58:06.500
because when he gets going about the subconscious

58:06.500 --> 58:08.560
and the amount of this that sits below the surface,

58:08.560 --> 58:13.260
like an iceberg and the fact that when we're kids,

58:13.260 --> 58:18.260
we're not obscuring a lot of that subconscious as much.

58:18.620 --> 58:21.220
And sometimes that can look a little more primitive.

58:21.220 --> 58:26.220
I mean, the kid that's disappointed will let you know.

58:26.700 --> 58:28.740
The kid that's excited will let you know.

58:28.740 --> 58:32.860
And you feel that raw exuberance or that raw dismayal.

58:32.860 --> 58:35.460
And I think that as we grow older,

58:35.460 --> 58:36.740
we learn to cover that stuff up.

58:36.740 --> 58:39.700
We wear masks and we have to be functional, right?

58:39.700 --> 58:40.860
I don't think we all wanna go around

58:40.860 --> 58:43.980
just being completely raw.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.020
But as you said, as you get older,

58:46.700 --> 58:48.820
you get to this point where you kinda go,

58:48.820 --> 58:53.020
eh, what are we really trying to protect anyway?

58:53.020 --> 58:56.380
I mean, I have this theory that certainly

58:56.380 --> 59:01.380
my experience has taught me that a lot of people,

59:01.920 --> 59:06.220
but I'll talk about men, cause that's what I know best,

59:07.560 --> 59:10.900
whether or not they show up strong or not,

59:10.900 --> 59:15.900
that they're really afraid of being weak.

59:15.980 --> 59:16.980
Like they're just afraid.

59:16.980 --> 59:18.520
Like sometimes the strength is even a way

59:18.520 --> 59:20.660
to try and not be weak, right?

59:20.660 --> 59:23.340
Which is different than being strong for its own sake.

59:23.340 --> 59:24.660
I'm not just talking about physical strength.

59:24.660 --> 59:25.740
I'm talking about intellectual strength.

59:25.740 --> 59:26.580
I'm talking about money.

59:26.580 --> 59:30.020
I'm talking about expressing drive.

59:30.020 --> 59:34.080
I've been watching this series a little bit of Chimp Empire.

59:34.080 --> 59:35.220
Oh yeah.

59:35.220 --> 59:37.420
So Chimp Empire is amazing, right?

59:37.420 --> 59:39.780
They have the head chimp, he's not the head chimp,

59:39.780 --> 59:44.660
but the alpha in the group and he's getting older.

59:44.660 --> 59:46.060
And so what does he do?

59:46.060 --> 59:49.580
Every once in a while, he goes on these vigor displays.

59:49.580 --> 59:50.900
He goes and he grabs branch.

59:50.900 --> 59:51.740
He starts breaking them.

59:51.740 --> 59:53.500
He starts thrashing them and he's incredibly strong.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.960
And they're all kind of like watching.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.780
I mean, yeah, I immediately think of people

59:56.780 --> 59:58.940
like they're deadlifting on Instagram.

59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.360
And I just think vigor displays a vigor.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.340
This is just the primate sowing that displays the vigor.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:08.000
Now what's interesting is that he's doing that specifically

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.420
to say, hey, I still have what it takes to lead this troop.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.260
Okay.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.940
And then there are the ones that are subordinate to him,

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.020
but not so far behind.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.960
It seems to be that there's a very clear

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.340
like numerical ranking.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:22.180
There is.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.620
Like it's clear who's the number two, number three.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.460
Oh yeah.

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.140
Who gets to mate first, who gets to eat first.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.980
This exists in other animal societies too,

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.860
but Bob Sapolsky would be a great person

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.980
to talk about this with,

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:34.220
because he knows obviously tremendous amount about it.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.620
And I know just the top contour, but yeah.

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.300
So number two, three, and four males are aware

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.580
that he's doing these vigor displays,

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.440
but they're also aware because in primate evolution,

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.020
they got some extra forebrain too, not as much as us,

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.140
but they got some.

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.900
And they're aware that the vigor displays are displays

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.280
that because they've done them as well

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.540
in a different context might not just be displays of vigor,

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.460
but might also be an insurance policy

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.700
against people seeing weakness.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.540
Okay.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:08.460
So now they start using that prefrontal cortex

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.620
to do some interesting things.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:14.100
So in primate world, if a male is friendly

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.900
with another male, wants to affiliate with him

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:18.900
and say, hey, I'm backing you,

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:22.780
they'll go over and they'll pick off the little parasites

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.620
and eat them.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.060
The grooming is extremely important.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.600
In fact, if they want to ostracize

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.100
or kill one of the members of their troop,

01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.380
they will just leave it alone.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.300
No one will groom it.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:35.900
And then there's actually a really disturbing sequence

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.100
in that show of then the parasites start to eat away

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.160
on their skin, they get infections, they have issues,

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.780
no one will mate with them.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.740
They have other issues as well and can potentially die.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.020
So the interesting thing is is number two and three

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.580
start to line up a strategy to groom this guy,

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:56.380
but they are actually thinking about overtaking

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.980
the entire troop, setting in a new alpha.

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.140
But the current alpha did that to get where he is.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.860
So he knows that they're doing this grooming thing,

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:09.180
but they might not be sincere about the grooming.

01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:10.020
So what does he do?

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:12.140
He takes the whole troop on a raid to another troop

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.140
and sees who will fight for him and who won't.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.140
This is advanced contracting of behavior

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.580
for species that normally we don't think of

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.140
as sophisticated as us.

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.220
So it's very interesting and it gets to something

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.060
that I hope we'll have an opportunity to talk about

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.780
because it's something that I'm obsessed with lately

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.060
is this notion of overt versus covert contracts, right?

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.300
There are overt contracts where you exchange work

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.380
for money or you exchange any number of things

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.100
in an overt way, but then there are covert contracts

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.880
and those take on a very different form

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.700
and always lead to, in my belief, bad things.

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.220
Well, how much of human and chimp relationships

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:53.100
are overt versus covert?

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:55.660
Well, here's one thing that we know is true.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:00.020
Dogs and humans, the dog to human relationship

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.940
is 100% overt.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:04.120
They don't manipulate you.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.740
Now, you could say they do in the sense that they learn

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.540
that if they look a certain way or roll on their back,

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:13.540
they get food, but there's no banking of that behavior

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.020
for a future date where then they're going to undermine you

01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:19.740
and take your position, okay?

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:22.380
So in that sense, dogs can be a little bit manipulative

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.420
in some sense, but now, okay.

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:29.260
So overt contract would be,

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.100
we both want to do some work together,

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.540
we're going to make some money,

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:35.220
you get X percentage, I get X percentage.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.700
Overt.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.700
Covert contract, which is, in my opinion, always bad,

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.140
would be, we're going to do some work together,

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:45.280
you're going to get a percentage of money,

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.500
I'm going to get a percentage of money.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.460
Could look just like the overt contract,

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:54.220
but secretly, I'm resentful that I got the percentage I got.

01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:59.220
So what I start doing is covertly taking something else.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:00.800
What do I take?

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.740
Maybe I take the opportunity to jab you verbally

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.020
every once in a while.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.840
Maybe I take the opportunity to show up late.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.820
Maybe I take the opportunity to get to know

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.900
one of your coworkers so that I might start a business

01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:14.040
with them, that's covert contracting.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.080
And you see this sometimes in romantic relationships.

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.060
One person, we won't set the male or female

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.180
in any direction here and just say,

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.460
it's I'll make you feel powerful

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.580
if you make me feel desired.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.420
Okay, great.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:29.300
There's nothing explicitly wrong about that contract

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:31.340
if they both know and they both agree.

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.820
But what if it's, I'll do that,

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.280
but I'll have kids with you so you feel powerful,

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.260
you'll have kids with me so I feel desired,

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.920
but secretly, I don't want to do that.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.780
Or one person says, I don't want to do that, or both don't.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.760
So what they end up doing is saying,

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.940
okay, so I expect something else.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.040
I expect you to do certain things for me,

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.220
or I expect you to pay for certain things for me.

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:58.020
Covert contracts are the signature of everything bad.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.080
Overt contracts are the signature of all things good.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.580
And I think about this a lot

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.180
because I've seen a lot of examples of this.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.360
Like anyone, we participate in these things,

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.200
whether or not we want to or not.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.200
And the thing that gets transacted the most is,

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.340
well, I should say the things that get transacted the most

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:21.420
are the overt things.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:26.420
You'll see money, time, sex, property,

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.140
whatever it happens to be, information.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:37.660
But what ends up happening is that when people,

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.440
I believe, don't feel safe, they feel threatened in some way.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.720
Like they don't feel safe in a certain interaction.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.740
What they do is they start taking something else

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.320
while still engaging in the exchange.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.620
And I'll tell you, if there's one thing

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.960
about human nature that's bad, it's that feature.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.640
Why that feature?

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.080
Or is it a bugger feature, as you engineers like to say?

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.840
I think it's because we were allocated

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.140
a certain extra amount of prefrontal cortex

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:08.640
that makes us more sophisticated than a dog,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.720
more sophisticated than a chimpanzee, but they do it too.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.720
And it's because it's often harder

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.200
to deal with, in the short term,

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.520
to deal with the real sense of this is scary,

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.800
this feels threatening,

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.800
than it is to play out all the iterations.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.200
It takes a lot of brain work.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.520
You're playing chess and go simultaneously

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.840
trying to figure out where things are gonna end up

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:36.960
and we just don't know.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.440
So it's a way I think of creating a false sense of certainty,

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.760
but I'll tell you, covert contracts,

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.760
the only certainty is that it's gonna end badly.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.420
The question is how badly?

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:51.420
Conversely, overt contracts always end well, always.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.420
The problem with overt contracts is that

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:56.220
you can't be certain that the other person

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.460
is not engaging in the covert contract.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.300
You can only take responsibility for your own contract.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.900
Well, one of the challenges of being human

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.420
is looking at another human being

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:11.420
and figuring out their way of being, their behavior,

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.460
which of the two types of contracts it represents,

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.300
because they look awfully the same on the surface.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.940
And one of the challenges of being human

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.700
is the decision we all make,

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.260
is are you somebody that takes a leap of trust

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.820
and trusts other humans that are willing to take the hurt?

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:31.300
Are you going to be cynical and skeptical

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.860
and avoid most interactions until they're,

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:37.860
they over a long period of time prove your trust?

01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.460
Yeah, I never liked the phrase history repeats itself

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.820
when it comes to humans

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:48.740
because it doesn't apply if the people or the person

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:52.660
is actively working to resolve their own flaws.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:54.140
I do think that if people are willing

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.940
to do dedicated introspective work,

01:07:56.940 --> 01:08:00.060
go into their subconscious, do the hard work,

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:03.420
have hard conversations and get better at hard conversation,

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.040
something that I'm constantly trying to get better at,

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.740
I think people can change, but they have to want to change.

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:13.300
It does seem like deep down,

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.980
we all can kind of tell the difference

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.540
between overt and covert.

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.940
Like we have a good sense.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.220
I think one of the benefits

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.540
of having this characteristic of mind

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.500
where I value loyalty,

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:26.380
I've been extremely fortunate to spend most of my life

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.460
in overt relationships.

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:31.900
And I think that creates a really fulfilling life.

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.260
But there's also this thing that maybe we're in this

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.380
portion of the podcast now, but I've experienced this-

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.780
She says this is late at night, we're talking.

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:40.140
That's right, certainly late for me,

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.920
but I'm two hours, I came in today on,

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.760
I'm still in California.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.140
And we should also say that you came here

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.300
to wish me a happy birthday.

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.340
I did.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.180
I did.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.380
And the podcast is just like a fun

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.860
last minute thing I suggested.

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.060
Yeah, some close friends of yours have arranged a dinner

01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.140
that I'm really looking forward to.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.340
I won't say which night, but it's the next couple of nights.

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.780
You know, your circadian clock

01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:06.940
is one of the most robust features of your biology.

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.780
I know you can be nocturnal or you can be diurnal.

01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.660
We know you're mostly nocturnal

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.960
at certain times of the year, Lux,

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.100
but there are very, very few people

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.460
can get away with no sleep.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:18.480
Very few people can get away

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.200
with a chaotic sleep wake schedule.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.960
So you have to obey a 24 hour, AKA circadian rhythm

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.300
if you want to remain healthy of mind and body.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:32.300
We also have to acknowledge that aging isn't linear, right?

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.400
So- What do you mean?

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.400
Well, I mean, the degree of change

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:41.800
between years 35 and 40 is not going to be the degree

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.680
of change between 40 and 45.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:47.240
But I will say this, I'm 48 and I feel better

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.000
in every aspect of my psychology and biology now

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.960
than I did when I was in my twenties.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.860
Yeah, sort of quality of thought, time spent.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:04.840
Physically, I can do what I did then,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.860
which is probably says more about what I could do then

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.100
than what I can do now.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.040
But if you keep training, you can continue to get better.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.220
The key is to not get injured.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.140
And I've never trained super hard.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.660
I've trained hard, but I've been cautious to not,

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.500
for instance, weight train more than two days in a row.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.380
I do a split which is basically three days a week

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.700
and the other days a run, take one full day off,

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:25.660
take a week off every 12 to 16 weeks.

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:28.080
I've not been the guy hurling the heaviest weights

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.540
or running the furthest distance.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:31.620
But I have been the guy who's continuing to do it

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.620
when a lot of my friends are talking about knee injuries.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.460
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:41.500
But of course with sport, you can't account for everything

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:42.840
the same way you can with fitness.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.900
And I have to acknowledge that, you know,

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.400
unless one is power lifting, weightlifting and running,

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.640
you can get hurt, but it's not like skateboarding

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.660
where if you're going for it, you're gonna get hurt.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.220
That's just you're landing on concrete

01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:01.420
and with jujitsu, like people are trying to hurt you

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:02.900
so that you say stop.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:06.220
So with a sport, it's different.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:10.060
And these days, I don't really do a sport any longer.

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.380
I work out to stay fit.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.380
I used to continue to do sports, but I kept getting hurt.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.680
And frankly, now like a rolled ankle,

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.900
I may put out a little small skateboard part in 2024

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.860
because people have been saying,

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.300
well, we want to see the kick flip.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.940
And I'll just say, well, I'll do a heel flip instead.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.540
But okay, I might put out a little part

01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:33.940
because some of the guys that work on our podcast

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.780
are from DC.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.940
I think by now I should at least do it

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:42.220
just to show like I'm not making it up and I probably will.

01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.100
But I think doing a sport is different.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.860
That's how you get hurt.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:48.380
Overuse and doing an actual sport.

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:52.040
And so, you know, hat tip to those do an actual sport.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.640
And that's a difficult decision.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.600
Like a lot of people have to make,

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:58.720
I have to make which jiu-jitsu, for example.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:00.480
Like if you just look empirically,

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.600
I've trained really hard from all my life

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.160
in grappling sports and fighting sports

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.680
and all this kind of stuff.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.360
And I've avoided injury for the most part.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:13.360
And I would say, I would attribute that to training a lot.

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.080
Sounds counterintuitive, but training well and safely

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.880
and correctly, keeping good form, saying no,

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.360
and then you have to say no,

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.020
but training a lot and taking it seriously.

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.120
Now, when this training is kind of a side,

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.680
really a side thing,

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:33.200
I find that the injury becomes a higher

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.360
and higher probability.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.960
But when you're just doing it every once in a while.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:36.800
Every once in a while.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.840
Yeah, I think you said something really important,

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:41.360
the saying no.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.680
I mean, the times I have gotten hurt training

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.680
is when someone's like,

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.120
hey, let's hop on this workout together.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.040
And it becomes a, let's challenge each other

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.440
to do something outrageous.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.720
Sometimes that can be fun though.

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.480
I went up to Cam Haynes' gym

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.880
and he does these very high repetition weight workouts

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.080
that are in circuit form.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.240
I was sore for two weeks,

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.720
but I learned a lot and didn't get injured.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.440
And yes, we ate bow hunted elk afterwards.

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.560
Nice.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.920
But the injury has been a really difficult

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.160
psychological thing for me.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:16.280
So I've injured my finger, pinky finger, injured my knee.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.240
Yeah, your kitchen is filled with splints.

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.080
Splints.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.720
I'm trying to figure out.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.040
It's like, if you look in Lex's kitchen,

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.680
there's some really good snacks.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.880
I had some right before.

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.160
He's very good about keeping cold drinks in the fridge

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.320
and all the water has element in it, which is great.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.160
I love that.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:41.320
But then there's a whole like hospital's worth of splints.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:42.160
Yeah, I'm trying.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:42.980
I'm trying to figure out.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:43.820
So here's the thing.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.640
You, I think it like pop out like this, right?

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.600
Pinky finger.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.160
I'm trying to figure out how do I splint in such a way

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.600
that I can still program, still play guitar,

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.000
but protect this kind of torque motion

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.240
that creates a huge amount of pain.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.640
Not to have a jujitsu injury.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.320
Jujitsu, but it's a, it's not the kind of,

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:04.600
it's probably more like a skateboarding style injury,

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:09.520
which is, it's unexpected in a silly,

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.360
in a silly way.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360
That's the thing that happens in a second.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.720
I didn't break my foot doing anything important.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.600
I broke my fifth minute, stepping off a curb.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.440
Yep.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.960
So it's, that's why they're called accidents.

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.920
You know, if you get hurt doing something awesome,

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:28.160
that's a trophy that you have to work through.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.700
It's part of your payment to the universe.

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.080
If you get hurt stepping off a curb

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.040
or you're doing something stupid,

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.240
it's called a stupid accident.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:40.640
Since we brought up Chimp Empire,

01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.440
let me ask you about relationships.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.720
I think we've talked about relationships.

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.560
Yeah, I only date homo sapiens.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.400
Homo sapiens.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.320
It's the morning meditation.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.240
The night is still young.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.560
You are human.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.920
No, but you are also animal.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.040
Don't sell yourself short.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.960
No, I always say, listen,

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:58.160
any discussion on the Human Lab podcast

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.840
about sexual health or anything,

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.000
I always speak the critical forms.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.480
Consensual, age appropriate, context appropriate,

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.760
species appropriate.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.600
Species appropriate, well.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.720
Can I just tell you about sexual selection?

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.560
I've been watching Life in Color with David Annenborough.

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.160
I've been watching a lot of nature documentaries.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Talking about inner peace,

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:20.440
it brings me so much peace to watch nature

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.100
at its worst and at its best.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.340
So Life in Color is a series on Netflix

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:28.580
where it presents some of the most colorful animals

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.400
on earth and kind of tells their story

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.680
of how they got there through natural selection.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.400
So you have the peacock with the feathers

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.720
and it's just such incredible colors.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.720
The peacock has these tail feathers, the male.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.240
They're like gigantic and they're super colorful

01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.000
and there are these eyes on it.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:52.120
It's not eyes, it's like I like areas

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.560
and they wiggle their ass like to show the tail.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560
They wiggle the tails.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.400
The eye spots.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.480
The eye spots, yes, thank you.

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.360
You know this probably way better than me.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360
I'm just quoting it.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.480
No, no, please continue.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.360
But it was, it's just, I'm watching this

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:06.120
and then the female is as boring looking as,

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.240
like she has no colors and nothing,

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.560
but she's standing there bored

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:13.760
just seeing this entire display.

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.440
And I'm just wondering like the entirety of life on earth,

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.880
or not the entirety, post-bacteria,

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.400
is like at least in part, maybe in large part,

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.880
can be described through this process

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.200
of natural selection, of sexual selection.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:34.200
So dudes fighting and then women selecting.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.920
Women selecting.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.400
It seems like it's just, the entirety of that series

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:44.160
shows some incredible birds and insects and shrimp.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.040
They're all beautiful and colorful.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:46.880
Manta shrimp.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.760
Manta shrimp.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:50.320
They're just, they're incredible.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:53.080
And it's all about getting laid.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:53.960
It's fascinating.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:58.160
Like I just, and there's nothing like watching Dad

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.280
and Champ Empire to make you realize,

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:03.120
we humans, that's the same thing.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:04.480
That's all we're doing.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.760
And all the beautiful variety,

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.200
all the bridges and the buildings

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.040
and the rockets and the internet,

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.280
all of that is this kind, is at least in part,

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.720
this kind of a product of this kind of showing off

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.920
for each other and all the wars and all of this.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.600
Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm asking.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.920
Oh, relationships, yes.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.200
Right, before you ask about relationships,

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:31.200
I think what's clear is that every species, it seems,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:36.400
animal species wants to make more of itself

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.440
and protect its young.

01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.960
Well, to protect its young is non-obvious.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.080
So not destroy enough of itself

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:49.840
that it can't get more to reproductive competent age.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.560
I mean, I think that, you know, we have a natural,

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.000
I mean, healthy people have a natural reflex

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.080
to protect children.

01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.800
Well, I don't know that.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.120
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.640
I've seen enough animals that are murdering the children

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.920
of some other- Sure, sure.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.240
There's even cyblicide, first of all,

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.880
I just wanna say that I was delighted in your delight

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.280
around animal kingdom stuff

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.120
because this is a favorite theme of mine as well.

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.240
But there's, for instance, some fascinating data on,

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:25.080
for instance, for those that grew up on farms,

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.760
they'll be familiar with free martins.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.360
You know about free martins, this is,

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:33.360
they're cows that have multiple calves inside them.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.080
And there's a situation in which the calves will secrete

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:41.040
if there's more than one inside will secrete chemicals

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.840
that will hormonally castrate the calf next to them

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.680
so they can't reproduce.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.600
So already in the womb, they are fighting

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:50.400
for future resources.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.320
That's how early this stuff can start.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.520
So it's chemical warfare in the womb against the siblings.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.880
Sometimes there's outright cyblicide.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:00.720
Siblings are born, they kill one another.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.000
This also becomes biblical stories, right?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.680
There are instances of cuttlefish,

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.840
beautiful cephalopods, like octopuses,

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:13.160
and that is the plural as we made clear.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.400
It's a meme on the internet.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.760
Oh yeah, that became a meme or a little discussion.

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.320
Yeah, it spread pretty quick.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.000
And now we just resurfaced it.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.560
That's great.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.880
The dismay in your voice is so amusing.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:29.360
In any event, the male cuttlefish will disguise themselves

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.520
by as female cuttlefish infiltrate

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:35.520
the female cuttlefish group and then mate with them.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.200
All sorts of types of covert operations.

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:44.760
So I think that-

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.400
It's like a drinking game where every time we say

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:51.120
covert contract in this episode,

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.880
you have to take a shot of espresso.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.200
Please don't do that, you'd be dead by the end.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.200
So actually it's just a small tangent.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:00.160
It does make me wonder how much intelligence

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.960
covert contracts require.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.000
It seems like not much.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.760
If you can do it in the animal kingdom,

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.560
there's some kind of instinctual,

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:10.280
it is based perhaps in like fear.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.880
Yeah, it could be simple algorithm.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:16.720
If there's some ambiguity about numbers

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.520
and I'm not with these guys,

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.320
and then flip to the alternate strategy.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.160
I actually have a story about this that I think is relevant.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.880
I used to have cuttlefish in my lab in San Diego.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.040
We went and got them from a guy out in the desert.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:30.000
We put them in the lab, it was amazing.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.120
And they had a postdoc who was studying

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.160
prey capture and cuttlefish.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.440
They have a very ballistic, extremely rapid strike

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:38.800
and grab of the shrimp.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.720
And we were using high-speed cameras

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.240
to characterize all this, looking at binocular.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.240
They normally have their eyes on the side of their head.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.080
When they see something they wanna eat,

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.600
the eyes translocate to the front,

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.840
which allows them stereopsis,

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.480
depth perception allows them to strike.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.160
We were doing some unilateral eye removals,

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:56.280
they would miss, et cetera.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:59.480
Okay, this has to do with eye spots.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:02.280
This was during a government shutdown period

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.280
where the ghost shrimp that they normally feed on,

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.480
that we would ship in from the Gulf down here,

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480
weren't available to us.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.040
So we had to get different shrimp.

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.960
And what we noticed was the cuttlefish normally

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.440
would just sneak up on the shrimp.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.760
We learned this by data collection.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.800
And if the shrimp was facing them,

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.400
they would do this thing with their tentacles

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.720
of kind of enchanting the shrimp.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.280
And if the shrimp wasn't facing them, they wouldn't do it.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.400
And they would ballistically grab it and eat them.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:35.280
Well, when we got these new shrimp,

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:38.440
the new shrimp had eye spots on their tails.

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:40.880
And then the cuttlefish would do this kind of attempt

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.640
to enchant regardless of the position of the ghost shrimp.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.480
So what does that mean?

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:46.480
Okay, well, it means that there's some sort of algorithm

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.440
in the cuttlefish's mind that says,

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.960
okay, if you see two spots, move your tentacles.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.280
So it can be, as you pointed out,

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.640
it can be a fairly simple operation,

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.480
but it looks diabolical.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.960
It looks cunning, but all it is is strategy B.

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.360
Yeah, but it's still somehow emerged.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.840
I mean, I don't think that,

01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:13.600
calling it an algorithm doesn't, I feel like-

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.760
Well, there's a circuit there

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.120
that gets implemented in a certain context,

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.080
but that circuit had to evolve.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:22.480
You do realize super intelligent AI will look at us humans

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:24.360
and will say the exact thing.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.680
There's a circuit in there that evolved

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.360
to do this algorithm A and algorithm B, and it's trivial.

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.320
And to us humans, it's fancy and beautiful

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.640
to write poetry about it, but it's just trivial.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.960
We don't understand the subconscious

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:42.880
because that AI algorithm cannot see into what it can't see.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.080
It doesn't understand the underworkings

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.640
of what allows all of this conversation stuff to manifest.

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:49.800
And we can't even see it.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.800
How could AI see it?

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.840
Maybe it will.

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.600
Maybe AI will solve and give us access to our subconscious.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:59.400
Maybe your AI friend or coach,

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.120
like I think Andreessen and others are arguing

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.840
it's going to happen at some point, is going to say,

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:07.160
hey, Lex, you're making decisions lately

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.440
that are not good for you,

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.280
but it's because of this algorithm

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.000
that you picked up in childhood

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:17.200
that if you don't state your explicit needs upfront,

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.960
you're not going to get what you want, so why do it?

01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.240
From now on, you need to actually make a list

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:25.320
of every absolutely outrageous thing that you want,

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.240
no matter how outrageous,

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.800
and communicate that immediately, and that will work.

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.840
We're talking about color-efficient sexual selection,

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.880
and then we went into some, where do we go?

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.360
And you said you were excited.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:40.000
I was excited.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.240
Well, you were just saying,

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.640
what about these covert contracts in animals do them?

01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:46.680
I think it's simple contextual engagement of a neural circuit,

01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.280
which is not just nerd speak for saying

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.160
they do a different strategy,

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.280
it's saying that there has to be a circuit there,

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.120
a hardwired circuit, maybe learned,

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.560
but probably hardwired, that can be engaged, right?

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.720
You can't build neural machinery in a moment.

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.200
You need to build that circuit over time.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.360
What is building it over time?

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.200
You select for it.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:08.200
The cuttlefish that did not have

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.000
that alternate context-driven circuit

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
didn't survive when all the shrimp

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.280
that they normally disappear

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.840
and the eye-spotted shrimp showed up,

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.520
and there were a couple that had some mis-wiring.

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.480
This is why mutation, right, X-Men stuff is real.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.840
They had a mutation that had some alternate wiring,

01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.520
and that wiring got selected for it,

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:32.680
became a mutation that was adaptive,

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:33.960
as opposed to maladaptive.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:35.560
This is something people don't often understand

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:39.320
about genetics, is that it only takes a few generations

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.240
to devolve a trait, make it worse,

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.520
but it takes a long time to evolve an adaptive trait.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:50.160
There are exceptions to that, but most often that's true.

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:52.320
So a species needs a lot of generations.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.400
We are hopefully still evolving as a species,

01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:00.280
and it takes a long time to evolve more adaptive traits,

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.120
but it doesn't take long to devolve adaptive traits

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.880
so that you're getting sicker

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.680
or you're not functioning as well.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.360
So choose your mate wisely,

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.680
and that's perhaps the good segue

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:12.480
into sexual selection in humans.

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.960
I could tell you're good at this.

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.680
We said, well, why did I bring up sexual selection

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.600
in relationships?

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.800
So sexual selection in humans.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.960
I don't think you've done an episode on relationships.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.360
No, I did an episode on attachment,

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.960
but not on relationships.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.760
The series with Conti includes one episode of the four

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.320
that's all about relational understanding

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.320
and how to select a mate based on matching of drives.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.240
All the demons inside the subconscious,

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:49.800
how to match demons, that they dance well together or what?

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.040
And how generative two people are.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:52.880
What does that mean?

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.000
Means how, the way he explains it is

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
how devoted to creating growth within the context

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.480
of the family, the relationship with work.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.160
Well, let me ask you about mating rituals

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.200
and how to find such a relationship.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:09.400
I mean, you're really big on friendships,

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.640
on the value of friendships.

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:11.480
I am.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.880
And that I think extends itself into one of the deepest

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:19.000
kinds of friendships you can have,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.360
which is a romantic relationship.

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:26.360
What mistakes, successes and wisdom can you impart?

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:32.440
Well, I've certainly made some mistakes.

01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:34.840
I've also made some good choices in this realm.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.800
First of all, we have to define

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.600
what sort of relationship we're talking about.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:43.640
If one is looking for a life partner,

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.280
potentially somebody to establish family with,

01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:48.320
with or without kids, with or without pets, right?

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.760
Families can take different forms.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.360
I mean, I certainly experienced being a family

01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:55.640
in a prior relationship where it was the two of us

01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:58.080
and our two dogs and then it was like, it was family.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.560
Like we had our little family.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:04.840
I think based on my experience and based on input

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.040
from friends who themselves

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:15.200
have very successful relationships,

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.200
I must say I've got friends who are in long-term,

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:25.640
monogamous, very happy relationships

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:30.120
where there seems to be a lot of love,

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:35.000
a lot of laughter, a lot of challenge and a lot of growth.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.600
And both people, it seems really want to be there

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.320
and enjoy being there.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.840
Just to pause on that.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:47.240
One thing to do, I think by way of advice

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:48.560
is listen to people who are

01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.600
in long-term successful relationships.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:53.880
That's like, it seems dumb, but like,

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.560
like we both know and are friends with Joe Rogan

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:59.600
who's been in a long-term really great relationship

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:01.520
and he's been an inspiration to me.

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.160
So you take advice from that guy.

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.320
Definitely.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.600
And several members of my podcast team

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.800
are in excellent relationships.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.640
I think one of the things that rings true

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:17.800
over and over again in the advice and in my experience

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.800
is find someone who's really a great friend.

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.760
Like build a really great friendship with that person.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.920
Now, obviously not just a friend

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.440
if we're talking romantic relationship,

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.400
but and of course sex is super important,

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:37.120
but it should be a part of that particular relationship

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:39.840
alongside or meshed with the friendship.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:45.320
Can it be a majority of the positive exchange?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.600
I suppose it could,

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.640
but I think the friendship piece is extremely important

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.440
because what's required in a successful relationship

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:54.960
clearly is joy in being together,

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.360
trust,

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:03.120
a desire to share experience,

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:07.680
both mundane and more adventurous,

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.120
support each other, acceptance,

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:15.880
a real maybe even admiration,

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:18.680
but certainly delight in being with the person.

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:20.320
Earlier we were talking about peace

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.960
and I think that that sense of peace comes from knowing

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.560
that the person you're in friendship with

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.600
or that you're in romantic relationship or ideally both,

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.880
because let's assume healthy,

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:30.160
the best romantic relationship

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.160
includes a friendship component with that person.

01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.360
It's like you just really delight in their presence,

01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:36.880
even if it's a quiet presence

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:43.760
and you delight in seeing them delight in things, right?

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.880
That's clear.

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.760
The trust piece is huge,

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.520
and that's where people start.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:53.440
We don't wanna focus on what works, not what doesn't work,

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:57.080
but that's where I think people start engaging

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:58.080
these covert contracts.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:00.960
They're afraid of being betrayed, so they betray.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:05.280
They're afraid of giving up too much vulnerability,

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.040
so they hide their vulnerability,

01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:11.280
or in the worst cases, they feign vulnerability.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.760
Again, that's a covert contract

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.120
that just simply undermines everything.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.000
It becomes one plus one equals two minus one to infinity.

01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:22.040
Conversely, I think if people

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.600
can have really hard conversations,

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:26.200
this is something I've had to work really hard on

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.520
in recent years that I'm still working hard on,

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.400
but the friendship piece seems to be the thing

01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:34.760
that rises to the top when I talk to friends

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:37.160
who are in these great relationships.

01:30:37.160 --> 01:30:40.240
It's like they have so much respect and love

01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.760
and joy in being with their friend

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.200
is the person that they wanna spend

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.440
as much of their non-working,

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:50.160
non-Platonic friendship time with

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.000
and the person that they wanna experience things with

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:52.840
and share things with.

01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:57.240
And it sounds so kind of canned and cliche nowadays,

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:59.640
but I think if you step back and examine

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.960
how most people go about finding a relationship,

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.600
sort of like, oh, am I attracted?

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.600
Of course, physical attraction is important

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:07.600
and other forms of attraction too.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:10.280
And they sort of enter through that portal,

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.720
which makes sense.

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.280
That's the mating dance, right?

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.080
That's the peacock situation.

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:17.920
Hopefully not the Cuddlefish situation.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:25.080
But I think that there seems to be a history

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.480
of people close to me getting into great relationships

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.600
where they were friends for a while first

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.600
or maybe didn't sleep together right away,

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.240
that they actually intentionally deferred on that.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:41.080
This has not been my habit or my experience.

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.840
I've gone the more, I think, typical,

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:46.320
like, oh, there's an attraction like this person.

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.160
There's an interest.

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.920
You kind of explore all dimensions of relationship

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.000
really quickly, except perhaps the moving in part

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.560
and the having kids part,

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.400
which ideally, because it's a bigger step,

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.360
harder to undo without more severe consequences.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.520
But I think the whole take it slow thing,

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.960
I don't think is about getting to know someone slowly.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.440
I think it's about that physical piece,

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.240
because that does change the nature of the relationship.

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:12.440
And I think it's because it gets right

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.840
into the more hardwired primitive circuitry

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.480
around our feelings of safety, vulnerability.

01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:26.280
There's something about romantic and sexual interactions

01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:31.320
where it's almost like assets and liabilities, right?

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.840
Where people are trying to figure out

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.480
how much to engage their time and their energy

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.640
in multiple, I'm talking about from both sides,

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:41.480
male, female, or whatever sides,

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.520
but where it's like assets and liabilities.

01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:45.240
And that's where it starts getting

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.480
into those complicated contracts early on, I think.

01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:53.440
And so maybe that's why if a really great friendship

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.560
and admiration is established first,

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.840
even if people are romantically and sexually attracted

01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.800
to one another, then that piece can be added in

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.520
a little bit later in a way that really kind of just

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.600
seals up the whole thing.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.440
And then who knows?

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:08.320
Maybe they spend 90% of their time having sex.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.840
I don't know.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:13.800
That's not for me to say or decide, obviously.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:17.720
But there's something there about staying out

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:22.720
of a certain amount of risk of having to engage

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:29.080
covert contract in order to protect oneself.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:34.080
But I do think love at first sight, this kind of idea,

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.080
is in part realizing very quickly

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.960
that you are great friends.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.320
Like I've had that experience of friendship recently.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.080
It's not really friendship, but like,

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:50.120
oh, you get each other with humans,

01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:52.000
not in a romantic setting.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:52.840
Right, friendship.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.680
Yeah, just friendship.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:55.880
Well, dare I say, I felt that way about you

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.720
when we met, right?

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.680
I was like, this dude's cool, and he's smart,

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.120
and he's funny, and he's driven, and he's giving,

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.440
and he's got an edge.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:10.440
And I want to learn from him, want to hang out with him.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.560
I mean, that was the beginning of our friendship

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:17.000
was essentially that set of internal realization.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:17.840
Just keep going, just keep going.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:19.480
And a sharp dresser.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.560
Yeah, yeah, just looks great shirtless on a horseback, yes.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.520
No, no, listen, despite what some people might say

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.320
on the internet, it's a purely platonic friendship.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.080
Somebody said, somebody asked if Andrew Huberman

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.440
has a girlfriend, and somebody says, I think so.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.280
And the third comment was, this really like breaks my heart,

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.600
like that Alex and Andrew are not an item.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.200
We are not, we are great friends, but we are not an item.

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.040
Yeah, true.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:46.880
It's official.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.440
I hear over and over again from friends

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.760
that have made great choices and awesome partners

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.200
and have these fantastic relationships

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:01.480
for long periods of time that seem to continue to thrive.

01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:02.320
At least that's what they tell me

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.600
and that's what I have observed.

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.720
Establish the friendship first

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:11.160
and give it a bit of time before sex.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.160
And so, I think that's the feeling, that's the feeling.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.320
And these are, we're talking micro features

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.040
and macro features, we're talking,

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:24.280
and this isn't about perfection,

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:25.600
it's actually about the imperfections,

01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.520
which is kind of cool.

01:35:26.520 --> 01:35:27.560
I like quirky people.

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.960
I like characters.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.520
I'll tell you where I've gone badly wrong,

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.720
where I see other people going badly wrong.

01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.120
If there is no rule that says that you have to be attracted

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.160
to all attractive people, by any means,

01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:44.640
it's very important to develop a sense of taste

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.480
in romantic attractions, I believe.

01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:51.040
What you really like in terms of a certain style,

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.840
a certain way of being.

01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:58.000
And of course, that includes sexuality

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.080
and sex itself, the verb.

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.120
But I think it also includes

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.240
there's just general way of being.

01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.680
And when you really adore somebody,

01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.640
you like the way they answer the phone.

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.040
And when they don't answer the phone that way,

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.120
you know something's off and you wanna know.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:18.120
And so, I think that the more you can tune up

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:20.600
your powers of observation,

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.400
not looking for things that you like,

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:26.360
and the more that stuff just kind of washes over you,

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.880
the more likely you are to quote unquote fall in love.

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.480
As a mutual friend of ours said to me,

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:33.680
you know, listen, when it comes to romantic relationships,

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:38.680
if it's not 100% in you, it ain't happening.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.840
And I've never seen a violation of that statement

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.960
where it's like, yeah, it's mostly good,

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:48.680
and there this, and there's like the negotiations.

01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:51.000
Already, it's doomed.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.400
And that doesn't mean someone has to be perfect,

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:53.600
the relationship has to be perfect,

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.600
but it's gotta feel 100% inside, like yes, yes, and yes.

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.400
I think Diceroth, when he was on here, your podcast,

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.120
mentioned something that, you know,

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.840
like I think the words were,

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.240
or maybe it was in his book, I don't recall,

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.360
but that love is one of these things

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.400
that we story into with somebody.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:15.320
We create this idea of ourselves in the future,

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:18.280
and we look at our past time together,

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.240
and then you story into it.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:21.640
I mean, there are very few things like that.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.920
I can't story into, you know, building flying cars.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.520
I have to actually go do something.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.520
I mean, yeah, and love is also retroactively constructed.

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:35.040
I mean, anyone who's gone through a breakup

01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.960
understands the grief of knowing, ah,

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:39.000
like this is something I really shouldn't be in

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.840
for whatever reason, because if it only takes one,

01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:42.200
if the other person doesn't want to be in it,

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.280
then you shouldn't be in it.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:45.800
But then missing so many things,

01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.080
and that's just the attachment machinery really at work.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:51.960
I have to ask you a question that somebody

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.880
on our amazing team wanted to ask.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.640
He's happily married.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.960
Another, like you mentioned, incredible relationship.

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.000
Are they good friends?

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.240
Are they amazing friends?

01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:02.080
There you go.

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.520
But folks, as I said, I'm not saying who it is,

01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.080
so I can say some stuff,

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:10.880
which is it started out as a great sexual connection.

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.720
Oh, well, there you go.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:14.360
But then became very close friends after that.

01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:15.760
Listen. There you go.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:16.600
So speaking of sex.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.280
There are many paths to right.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.280
He has a wonderful son,

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.720
and he's willing to have a second kid,

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.480
and he went to ask the great Andrew Huberman,

01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:29.480
is there like sexual positions or any kind of thing

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.200
that can help maximize the chance

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.440
that they have a girl versus a boy?

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:36.880
Because they had a wonderful boy, they want a girl.

01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:39.240
Is there a way to control the gender?

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:41.800
Well, this has been debated for a long time,

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:45.120
and I did a four and a half hour episode on fertility.

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.920
And the reason I did a four and a half hour episode

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.600
on fertility is that, first of all,

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:52.240
I find that reproductive biology be fascinating,

01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:57.240
and I wanted a resource for people that were thinking about

01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:01.280
or struggling with having kids for whatever reason.

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.360
And it felt important to me to combine the male

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.320
and female components in the same episode.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.160
It's all timestamped,

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:07.680
so you don't have to listen to the whole thing.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.080
And we talk about IVF and neutral fertilization,

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.400
and we talk about natural pregnancy.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.000
Okay, the data on position is very interesting.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.200
But let me just say a few things.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.200
There are a few clinics now, in particular,

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:21.200
some out of the United States,

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.240
that are spinning down sperm

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.520
and finding that they can separate out fractions,

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.360
as they're called,

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:29.360
that can spin the sperm down at a given speed,

01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:32.640
and they'll separate out at different sort of depths

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.800
within the test tube that allow them to pull out the sperm

01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:41.160
on top or below and bias the probability

01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.440
towards male or female births.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.440
It's not perfect, it's not 100%.

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.840
It's a very costly procedure.

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.760
It's still very controversial.

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.000
Now, with in vitro fertilization, you can extract eggs.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.200
You can introduce a sperm directly by pipette

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.520
in this process called ICSI,

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.840
or you can set up a sperm race in a dish.

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.040
And if you get a number of different embryos,

01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.680
meaning the eggs get fertilized,

01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:07.280
they duplicate and start formoblasticis,

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.400
which is a ball of cells, early embryo,

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.160
then you can do karyotyping.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:14.040
So you can look for XX or XY, select the XY,

01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.320
which then would give rise to a male offspring

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.240
and implant that one.

01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.880
So there is that kind of sex selection.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:25.000
With respect to position, there's a lot of lore

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:29.920
that if the woman is on top or the woman's on the bottom

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.700
or whether or not the penetration is from behind,

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:34.680
whether or not it's gonna be male or female offspring,

01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.200
and frankly, the data are not great, as you can imagine,

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:43.200
because those would be interesting studies to run, perhaps.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.160
But there is study, there is paper.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:46.600
There are some.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.520
They're not, I guess, there's more lore than science.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.520
And there are a lot of other variables

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:52.720
that are hard to control.

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.080
So for instance, if it's ejaculation during intermission,

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.600
during sex penetration, et cetera,

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.000
then you can't measure, for instance, sperm volume

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:05.920
as opposed to when it's IVF,

01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.520
and they can actually measure how many milliliters,

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.880
how many forward motile sperm.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:11.120
It's hard to control for certain things,

01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:13.480
and it's just gonna vary between individuals

01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:15.520
and even from one ejaculation to the next.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.480
And okay, so there's too many variables.

01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:20.380
However, the position thing is interesting

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.120
in the following way.

01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:24.240
And then I'll answer whether or not

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:25.680
you can bias towards a female.

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.960
As long as we're talking about sexual-

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.160
I have other questions about sex-

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:31.000
But as long as we're talking about sexual position,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.560
there are data that support the idea

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.560
that in order to increase the probability

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.640
of successful fertilization,

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.640
that indeed the woman should not stand upright after sex

01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:52.120
and should, right after the man is ejaculated inside her,

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.000
and should adjust her pelvis, say, 15 degrees upwards.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.360
I mean, some of the fertility experts, MDs,

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:02.200
will say, that's crazy,

01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:06.280
but others that I sought out,

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.800
and not specifically for this answer,

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.760
but for researching that episode,

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.200
said that, yeah, you know what you're talking about

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:14.320
is trying to get the maximum number of sperm

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.800
and it's contained in semen,

01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.400
and yes, the semen can leak out.

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.200
And so keeping the pelvis tilted for about 15 degrees,

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.760
for about 15 minutes,

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.120
obviously tilted in the direction

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:25.760
that would have things running upstream,

01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:27.960
not downstream, so to speak.

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.000
Gravity.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:30.280
Gravity, it's real.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:36.120
So for maximizing fertilization,

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.600
the doctors I spoke to just said,

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:42.040
look, given that if people are trying to get pregnant,

01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.480
what is spending 15 minutes on their back?

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:46.680
This sort of thing.

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.920
Okay, so then with respect to female,

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.920
getting a female offspring or XX female offspring,

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:01.560
selectively, there is the idea that as fathers get older,

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:04.440
they're more likely to have daughters as opposed to sons.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.680
That's a, from the papers I've read is a significant,

01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:11.560
but still mildly significant result.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.880
So with each passing year,

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.360
this person increases the probability

01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.920
they're gonna have a daughter, not a son.

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:19.760
So that's interesting.

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.040
But the probability differences are probably tiny.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.440
I mean, it's not, you know, it's a significant,

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:28.240
it's not trivial, it's not a trivial difference.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.160
But if they want to ensure having a daughter,

01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:37.480
then they should do IVF and select an XX embryo.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.280
And when you go through IVF,

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.520
they genetically screen them for karyotype,

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:42.760
which is XX, XY.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.880
And they look at mutations, genotypic mutations

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:51.920
for things like, you know, trisomies and aneuploidies,

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.960
all the stuff you don't want.

01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.320
But there is a lot of lures.

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.480
You look on the internet. Sure, different foods.

01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.520
So there are a lot of variables.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.360
There's a lot of variables,

01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:00.680
but there haven't been systematic studies.

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:04.880
So I think probably the best thing to do,

01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:07.040
unless they're gonna do IVF, is just, you know,

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:08.000
roll the dice.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.440
And, you know, I think with each passing year,

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:14.800
they increase the probability of getting a female offspring.

01:44:14.800 --> 01:44:17.680
And with, but of course, with each passing year,

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:20.440
the egg and sperm quality degrade.

01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:23.000
So, you know, get after it soon.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.520
So I went down a rabbit hole.

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.680
There's like sexology, there's journals on sex.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.640
Sure.

01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.480
Okay, so I-

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.640
And some of them, some of them, not all quite reputable.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:36.480
Yeah.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:37.880
And some of them really pioneering

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.920
in the sense that they've taken on topics

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:45.120
that are, you know, considered, you know,

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.040
outside the main frame of what people talk about,

01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.480
but they're very important.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.800
We have episodes coming out soon with, for instance,

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.960
the head of male urology, sexual health,

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:57.120
and reproductive health at Stanford, Michael Eisenberg,

01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.720
but also, you know, one with a female urologist,

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.080
sexual health, reproductive health, Dr. Rina Malik,

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.880
who's on, has a quite active YouTube presence.

01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:10.800
She does these really like dry,

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.480
like scientific presentation, but very nice.

01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.200
She has a lovely voice and she,

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.280
but she'll be talking about, you know,

01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.200
erections or squirting or like all is it like,

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:23.240
she does like very kind of internet type content,

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:25.440
but she's a legitimate urologist,

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.040
reproductive health expert.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:30.160
And in the podcast, we did talk about

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.040
both male and female orgasm.

01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.200
We talked a lot about sexual function, dysfunction.

01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.640
We talked a lot about pelvic floor.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:42.640
One interesting factoid is that only three,

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.800
only 3% of sexual dysfunction

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:50.800
is hormonal endocrine in nature.

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:53.320
It's more often related to some pelvic floor

01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:58.320
or vasculature, blood flow related or other issue.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.480
And then when Eisenberg came on the podcast,

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:04.240
he said that far less sexual dysfunction

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.600
is psychogenic in origin than people believe

01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.120
that far more of it is pelvic floor, neuro and vascular.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.760
So, you know, there are the myths of,

01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.960
I mean, it's not saying that it's,

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:17.080
that psychogenic dysfunction doesn't exist,

01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.840
but that a lot of the sexual dysfunction

01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.720
that people assume is related to hormones

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:24.320
or that is related to psychogenic issues

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.560
are related to vascular or neural issues.

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:31.280
And the good news is that there are great remedies for those.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:33.880
And so both those episodes detail

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.560
some of the more salient points

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.840
around what those remedies are and could be.

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.480
I mean, one of the kind of, again, factoids,

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.120
but it was interesting that a lot of people

01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:45.040
have pelvic floor issues,

01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.960
and they think that their pelvic floors

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.640
are quote unquote, messed up.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.480
So they go on the internet,

01:46:50.480 --> 01:46:52.640
they learn about kegels, kegels, you know,

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.240
and it turns out that some people need kegels,

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:56.760
they need to strengthen their pelvic floor.

01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.280
Guess what?

01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.160
A huge number of people with sexual

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:05.200
and urologic dysfunction have pelvic floors

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.040
that are too tight,

01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:08.000
and kegels are gonna make them far worse,

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.200
and they actually need to learn to relax their pelvic floor.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.320
And so seeing a pelvic floor specialist is important.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.000
I think in the next five, 10 years,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.080
we're gonna see a dramatic shift

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.800
towards more discussion about sexual

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:20.520
and reproductive health in a way that acknowledges

01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.200
that, yeah, the clitoris comes from the same origin tissue

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.720
as the penis, and in many ways,

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.920
the neural innervation of the two,

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.360
while clearly different, has some overlapping features

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.360
that there's gonna be discussion around kind of anatomy

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:40.080
and hormones and pelvic floors in a way

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:45.080
that's gonna erode some of the kind of cloaking

01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.400
of these topics,

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.000
because they've been cloaked for a long time,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.200
and there's a lot of, well, let's just call it what is,

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.120
there's a lot of bullshit out there about what's what.

01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:56.760
And now the hormonal issues, by the way,

01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:00.160
just to clarify, can impact desire.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.800
So a lot of people who have lack of desire

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:06.000
as opposed to lack of anatomical function,

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.120
this could be male or female,

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:10.920
that can originate with either things like SSRIs

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.400
or hormonal issues, and so we talk about that as well.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:15.080
So it's a pretty vast topic.

01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.600
Okay, you're one of the most productive people I know.

01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:22.320
What's the secret to your productivity?

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.680
How do you maximize the number of productive hours in a day?

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.440
You're a scientist, you're a teacher,

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:30.200
you're a very prolific educator.

01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.520
Well, thanks for the kind words.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.680
I struggle like everybody else,

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.680
but I am pretty relentless about meeting deadlines.

01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:44.520
I miss them sometimes,

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.760
but sometimes that means cramming,

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:48.520
sometimes that means starting early, but.

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:51.240
Has that been hard, sorry, to interrupt with the podcast?

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:52.600
There's certain episodes,

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:58.120
I mean, you're like taking just incredibly difficult topics

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.840
and you know there's going to be a lot

01:49:00.840 --> 01:49:03.360
of really good scientists listening to those

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.400
with a very skeptical and careful eye.

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.520
Do you struggle meeting that deadline sometimes?

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.760
Yes, we've pushed out episodes

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.360
because I want more time with them.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.400
I haven't advertised this,

01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:19.800
but I have another fully tenured professor

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:24.440
that started checking my podcasts

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:27.000
and helping me find papers.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:27.920
He's a close friend of mine,

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:30.680
he's an incredible expert in neuroplasticity

01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:34.480
and that's been helpful, but I do all the primary research

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.400
for the episodes myself.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.200
Although my niece has been doing a summer internship with me

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:42.040
and finding amazing papers, she did last summer as well.

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:44.120
She's really good at it.

01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:45.680
Just stick that kid on the internet

01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:47.840
and she gets great stuff.

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:50.840
Can I ask you, just going on tangents here,

01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:53.720
what's the hardest, finding the papers

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.440
or understanding what a paper is saying?

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.600
Finding the best papers, yeah.

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:02.320
Because you have to read a bunch of reviews,

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.080
figure out who's getting cited,

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.480
call people in a field, make sure that this is the stuff.

01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.160
I mean, I did this episode recently on ketamine,

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.960
about ketamine, I wasn't on ketamine,

01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:15.000
and there's this whole debate about S versus R ketamine,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:18.080
SR ketamine, and I called two clinical experts at Stanford.

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.320
I had a researcher at UCLA help me.

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.120
Even then, a few people had gripes about it.

01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:24.680
I don't think they understood a section

01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:27.080
that I was perhaps could have been clearer about.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.240
But yeah, you're always concerned

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:34.160
that people either won't get it or I won't be clear.

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.920
So the researching is mainly about finding the best papers.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.400
And then I'm looking for papers

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.000
that establish a thoroughness of understanding

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.560
that are interesting, obviously.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.840
It's fun to get occasionally and look at some of the odder

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:51.520
or more progressive papers that are what's new in a field,

01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.680
and then where there are actionable takeaways

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.440
to really export those with a lot of thoughtfulness.

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:01.240
I mean, I think that going back to the productivity thing,

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:05.400
I do, I get up, I look at the sun,

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.800
I don't stare at the sun, but I get my sunshine.

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.280
It all starts with a really good night's sleep.

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:11.320
I think that's really important to understand.

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:13.720
So much so that if I wake up and I don't feel rested enough,

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.400
I'll often do a non-sleep deep rest, yoga nidra,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.600
or go back to sleep for a little bit, get up,

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.200
really prioritize the big block of work

01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:23.800
for the thing that I'm researching.

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.160
I think a little bit of anxiety

01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:27.760
and a little bit of concern about deadline helps.

01:51:29.240 --> 01:51:30.720
Turning the phone off helps.

01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.920
Realizing that those peak hours, whenever they are for you,

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:38.880
you do not allow those hours to be invaded

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.520
unless there's a nuclear bomb goes off.

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:48.520
And nuclear bomb is just a phraseology for,

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.640
it could be family crisis would be good justification

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.880
if there's an emergency, obviously.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:56.680
But it's all about focus.

01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.520
It's all about focus in the moment.

01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:01.600
It's not even so much about how many hours you log.

01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:02.800
It's really about focus.

01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:05.440
How much total focus can you give to something?

01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:08.680
And then I like to take walks and think about things

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:11.320
and sometimes talk about them in my voice recorder.

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:14.560
So I'm just always churning on it all the time.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.400
And then of course, learning to turn it off

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.640
and engage with people socially

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:24.880
and not be podcasting 24 hours a day in your head is key.

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:27.280
But I think I love learning and researching

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:29.840
and finding those papers and the information

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.840
and I love teaching it.

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:33.160
And these days I use a whiteboard.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:36.480
Before I start, I don't have any notes, no teleprompter.

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:38.560
Then the whiteboard that I use beforehand

01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:41.640
is to really sculpt out the different elements and the flow,

01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:44.560
get the flow right and move things around.

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.120
The whiteboard is such a valuable tool.

01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:48.400
Then take a couple of pictures of that

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:50.400
when I'm happy with it, put it down on the desk.

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:51.800
And these are just bullet points.

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.120
And then just churn through and just churn through.

01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:57.520
And nothing feels better than researching

01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:58.680
and sharing information.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:02.440
And as you did, grew up writing papers

01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:05.360
and it's hard and I like the friction of like,

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:08.320
can't, you know, I wanna get up, wanna use the bathroom.

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:12.000
When I was in college, I was trying to make up deficiencies

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.960
from my lack of attendance in high school.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:17.520
So much so that I would set a timer,

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.320
I wouldn't let myself get up to use the bathroom even.

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.520
Never had an accident, but I was, you know,

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.560
I mean, it was like, I listened to music,

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:27.560
classical music, rancid, a few other things,

01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:32.160
some Bob Dylan maybe thrown in there and just study.

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:36.040
And it felt, and then, you know, hit the two hour mark

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.440
and you're in pain and then you get up and you're like,

01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.680
use the bathroom, like that felt so good.

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:43.400
There's something about the human brain that likes

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:45.720
these kinds of friction points and working through them

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.800
and you just have to work through them.

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:51.080
So yeah, I'm productive and my life is arranged around it.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:53.400
And, you know, that's been a bit of a barrier

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.440
to personal life at times,

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.400
but my life's been arranged around it.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:00.800
I've set up everything so that I can learn more, teach more

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.680
including, you know, some of my home life.

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:09.720
And, but I do, you know, still watch Chimp Empire.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.240
Still got time to watch Chimp Empire.

01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:14.080
Look, the great Joe Strummer, right?

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:16.640
Clash or my favorite Mescalero as he said, you know,

01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:20.360
this famous Strummer quote, no input, no output.

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.320
So you need experience, you need outside things

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:27.840
in order to foster the process.

01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.280
But yeah, just nose to the grindstone, man.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.120
I don't know.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.760
And that's what I'm happy to do with my life.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.080
I don't think anyone should do that just because,

01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.680
but this is how I'm showing up.

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:43.440
And, you know, if you don't like me, then scroll.

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:44.280
What do they say?

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.760
Swipe left, swipe right, I don't know.

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:47.600
I'm not on the apps, the dating apps.

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:48.960
So that's the other thing.

01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.280
I keep waiting for when listens to Lex Freeman podcast

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:56.360
is a check box on like Hinge or Bumble or whatever it is.

01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.120
But I don't even know are those that are field

01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.280
is I don't know what the, what are the apps now?

01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:04.960
I've never used an app and I always felt troublesome

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.440
how little information is provided on apps.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.480
Well, they're the ones that are like a stock lake,

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.960
like Raya, you know, it's like they sort of like companies

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.960
will actually fill them with, you know,

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.880
people that look a certain way and-

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.840
Well, soon it'll be filled with AI.

01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:22.320
Oh, yeah.

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:25.920
That's the way you said oh, the heartbreak within that.

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.000
Well, I, you know, I'm guilty of liking

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.360
real human interaction.

01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:32.400
Have you tried AI interaction?

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:36.400
No, but I have a feeling you're gonna convince me to.

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:38.640
One day.

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:43.880
Yeah, I've also struggled finishing projects that are new,

01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:46.360
that are something new.

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.840
Like for example, one of the things I've really struggled

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:51.240
finishing is something that's in Russian

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.320
that requires translation and overdub

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.600
and all that kind of stuff.

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:57.240
The other project I've been working on for like over

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:03.160
at least a year, off and on, but trying to finish

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:04.640
is something we've talked about in the past

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.360
is I'm still on it, a project on Hitler in World War II.

01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:11.040
I've written so much about it and I just don't know

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:11.880
why I can't finish it.

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:16.120
I have trouble like really, I think I'm terrified

01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:18.320
being in front of the camera.

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:19.160
Like this?

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:19.980
Like this.

01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:20.820
Or solo?

01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:22.880
Well, actually, no, no, no, solo.

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:25.280
Well, if ever you wanna do solo, and seriously,

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.600
because we've done this before, right?

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:29.760
Our clandestine study missions.

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:31.640
I'm happy to sit in the corner and work on my book

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.440
or do something if you wanna, if it feels good.

01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.480
Just for the feeling of somebody else?

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.320
Definitely.

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:37.640
Well, what do you, I mean, how do you,

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.560
you don't seem to, you seem to have been fearless

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.360
to just sit in front of the camera by yourself

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.040
to do the episode.

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:48.920
Yeah, it was weird.

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.640
I mean, the first year of the podcast,

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:51.840
it just spilled out of me.

01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:54.280
It was just, I had all that stuff I was so excited about.

01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.640
I'd been talking to everyone who would listen

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:01.640
and anyone, even when they'd run away, I'd keep talking.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:04.720
Before there was ever a camera, wasn't on social media.

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:05.920
2019, I posted a little bit.

01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:07.720
2020, as you know, I started going on podcasts.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.680
But yeah, I had so, I just,

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:14.360
I just, the zest and delight in this stuff.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.400
It's like circadian rhythms.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:16.400
I'm gonna tell you about this stuff.

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:18.260
I just felt like here was the opportunity

01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:19.840
and just let it burst.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.680
And then as we've gotten into topics

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:25.720
that are a little bit further away from my home knowledge,

01:57:25.720 --> 01:57:30.720
you know, it's like, I still get super excited about it.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.160
It's music in the brain episode

01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:34.480
I've been researching for a while now.

01:57:34.480 --> 01:57:36.320
I'm just so hyped about it.

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:37.880
It's so, so interesting.

01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:39.040
There's so many facets.

01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:43.880
Singing versus improvisational, excuse me, music versus,

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:47.200
I'm listening to music versus learning music.

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:48.760
I mean, it just goes on and on.

01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:51.480
There's just so much that's so interesting.

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.920
I just can't get enough.

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:56.140
And I think, I don't know, you put a camera in front of me,

01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:57.440
I sort of forget about it.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:01.020
And I'm just trying to just teach.

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.560
Yeah, so that's a different, that's interesting.

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.320
I mean, maybe I need to find that joy as well.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.080
But like for me, a lot of the joy is in the writing

01:58:09.080 --> 01:58:11.940
and the camera, there's something.

01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:13.720
Well, the best lecturers, as you know,

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:15.440
and you're in a phenomenal lecturer,

01:58:15.440 --> 01:58:17.080
so you embody this as well.

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.880
But when I teach at Stanford,

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.320
I was directing this course in neuroanatomy and neuroscience

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.500
and for medical students.

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:25.160
And I noticed that the best lecturers would come in

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.500
and they're teaching the material

01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:28.960
from a place of deep understanding,

01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:33.280
but they're also experiencing it as a first-time learner

01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:34.400
at the same time.

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:36.480
So it's just sort of embodying the delight of it,

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.940
but also the authority over the, not authority,

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.460
but the sort of mastery of the material.

01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:43.760
And it's really the delight in it

01:58:43.760 --> 01:58:45.480
that the students are linking onto.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:47.100
And of course they need and deserve

01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:48.720
the best accurate material.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.140
So they have to know what they're talking about.

01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:53.260
But yeah, just tap into that energy of learning

01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.260
and loving it and people are along for the ride.

01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.140
Or, you know, I get accused of being long-winded,

01:58:58.140 --> 01:59:01.300
but you know, things get taken out of context

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:03.040
that leads to greater misunderstanding.

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:04.420
And also I look at, listen,

01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:07.060
I come from a lineage of three dead advisors,

01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:09.620
three, all three.

01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:12.760
So I don't know when the reaper's coming for me.

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.640
I'm doing my best to stay alive a long time,

01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:16.420
but whether or not it's a bullet or a bus

01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:20.260
or cancer or whatever, or just old age,

01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:24.820
I mean, I'm trying to get it all out there as best I can.

01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:26.380
And if it means you have to hit pause

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:27.620
and come back a day or two later,

01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.260
like that seems like a reasonable compromise to me.

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:33.960
I'm not going to go longer than I need to.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.620
And I'm trying to shorten them up.

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.700
But again, that's kind of how I show up.

01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:42.020
It's like Tim Armstrong would say about writing songs.

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.440
I asked him, do you write, how often do you write?

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:45.300
Every day, every day.

01:59:45.340 --> 01:59:46.700
Is Rick ever stopped creating?

01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:47.540
No.

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:48.780
Is Joe ever stopped preparing for comedy?

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:51.940
Are you ever stopping to think about world issues

01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:54.340
and technology and who you can talk to?

01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:57.500
I mean, it seems to me you've always got a plan,

01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:58.340
the inside.

01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:01.620
The thing I love about your podcast the most,

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.260
to be honest, these days,

02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.660
is the surprise of like,

02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:06.420
I don't know who the hell is going to be there.

02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:10.160
It's almost like I get a little nervously excited

02:00:10.160 --> 02:00:12.020
about when a new episode comes out,

02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:14.780
because I have no idea, no idea.

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:17.220
I have some guesses based on what you told me

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.060
during the break.

02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:20.380
I mean, you've got some people where it's just like,

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:23.740
whoa, Lex's went there?

02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:24.580
Awesome.

02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.900
Can't wait, click.

02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:28.620
I think that's really cool.

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:30.300
You're constantly surprising people.

02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:33.300
So you're doing it so well.

02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:34.780
It's such a high level.

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:38.140
And I think it's also important for people to understand

02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:42.260
that what you're doing, Lex, there's no precedent for it.

02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:43.620
Sure, there have been interviews before.

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:44.820
There have been podcasts before.

02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:46.120
There are discussions before.

02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:46.960
But it's not like,

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:48.660
how many of your peers can you look to

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:51.580
to find out how best to do the content like yours?

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:52.540
Zero.

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.660
There's one peer, you.

02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:59.660
And so that should give you great peace and great excitement

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:02.700
because you're a pioneer.

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.540
You're literally the tip of the spear.

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.680
I don't want to take an unnecessary tangent,

02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.300
but I think this might thread together

02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.620
two of the things that we've been talking about,

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:12.160
which are, I think, of pretty key importance.

02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:13.960
One is romantic relationships

02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:16.360
and the other is creative process and work.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.560
And this, again, is something I learned from Rick,

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.440
but that he and I have gone back and forth on

02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:23.500
and that I think is worth elaborating on,

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:25.800
which is earlier we were saying,

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.800
the best relationship is going to be one

02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.920
where it brings you peace.

02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:32.720
I think peace also can be translated to,

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.240
among other things, lack of distraction.

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:38.080
So when you're with your partner,

02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:42.120
can you really focus on them and the relationship?

02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:47.120
Can you not be distracted by things that you're upset

02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:51.680
about from their past or from your past with them

02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.560
or their, and of course the same is true for them, right?

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.560
They ideally will feel that way towards you too.

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.120
They can really focus.

02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.960
Also, when you're not with them,

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:02.560
can you focus on your work?

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.900
Can you not be worried about whether or not they're okay

02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:07.240
because you trust that they're an adult

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.120
and they can handle things

02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:11.020
or they will reach out if they need things.

02:02:11.020 --> 02:02:13.720
They're going to communicate their needs like an adult,

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:16.200
not creating messes just to get attention

02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:21.040
and things like that or disappearing for that matter.

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:26.040
So peace and focus are intimately related

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:31.380
and distraction is the enemy of peace and focus.

02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.720
So there's something there, I believe,

02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:38.140
because with people that have the strong generative drive

02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:41.720
and want to be productive in their home life

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.520
in the sense of have a rich family life or partner life,

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.600
whatever that is, and in their work life,

02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.240
the ability to really drop into the work

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:51.640
and like, okay, you might have that sense,

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:54.640
like I hope they're okay or need to check my phone

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:56.880
or something, but just know we're good.

02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.580
So peace and focus, I think, and being present are so key

02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:03.760
and it's key at every level of romantic relationship

02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:07.240
from certainly presence and focus,

02:03:07.240 --> 02:03:12.240
everything from sex to listening, to raising a family,

02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.080
to tending to the house, and in work,

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.800
it's absolutely critical.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:21.300
So I think that those things are kind of mirror images

02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:24.420
of the same thing and they're both important reflections

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:25.260
of the other.

02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:28.680
And when you start to just, when work is not going well,

02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:33.640
then the focus on relationship can suffer and vice versa.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.000
And it's crazy how important that is,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:42.000
how incredibly wonderful it could be to have a person

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:47.240
in your life that kind of enables that creative focus.

02:03:47.240 --> 02:03:50.640
Yeah, and you supply the peace and focus

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.200
for their endeavors, whatever those might be.

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:57.060
I mean, that symmetry there, because clearly,

02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.720
people have different needs and the need

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:01.520
to just really trust, like when Lex is working,

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:06.560
he's in his generative mode and I know he's good.

02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:11.040
And so then they feel sure they've contributed to that,

02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:13.760
but then also what you're doing is supporting them

02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.560
in whatever way it happens to be.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:17.180
And I think that sometimes you'll see that.

02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:19.120
People will pair up along creative creative

02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:22.380
or musical musical or computer scientists.

02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:25.800
But I think, again, going back to this Conti episode

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:29.640
on relationships is that the superficial labels

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:32.360
are less important, it seems, than just the desire

02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:36.000
to create that kind of home life and relationship together.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.480
And as a consequence, the work mode,

02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:43.020
and for some people, both people aren't working

02:04:43.020 --> 02:04:47.000
and sometimes they are, but I think that's the good stuff.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.240
And I think that's the big learning in all of it

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.680
is that the further along I go with each birthday,

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:54.280
I guarantee you're gonna be like,

02:04:54.280 --> 02:04:57.240
what I want is simpler and simpler and harder and harder

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.200
to create, but oh, so worth it.

02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:04.480
The inner and the outer piece.

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:09.480
It's been over two years, I think, since Costello passed away.

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:12.560
It still tears me up.

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:15.520
I cried about him today.

02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:16.720
Cried about him today.

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:21.060
It's proportional to the love,

02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:22.880
but yeah, I'll cry about it right now if I think about it.

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:23.960
It wasn't putting him down.

02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:26.160
It wasn't the act of him dying, any of that.

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:28.760
Actually, that was a beautiful experience.

02:05:28.760 --> 02:05:31.320
I didn't expect it to be, but it was in my place

02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:33.200
when I was living in Topanga during the pandemic

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.920
where we launched the podcast and I did it at home

02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:39.520
and he hated the vets, I did it at home.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:44.520
And he gave out this huge, right at the end.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:47.360
And I could just tell he had been in just,

02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:48.640
not a lot of pain, fortunately,

02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:52.340
but he had just been working so hard just to move at all.

02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:55.320
And the craziest thing happened, it was unbelievable.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:57.000
I've never had an experience like this.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.180
I expected my heart to break

02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:00.720
and I felt a broken heart before.

02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:04.040
I felt it, frankly, when my parents split.

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:07.140
I felt it when Harry shot himself.

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.320
I felt it when Barbara died

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:14.320
and felt it when Ben went as well.

02:06:14.680 --> 02:06:17.000
And so many friends, like way too many friends.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.680
I mean, end of 2017, my friend Aaron King,

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:24.840
Johnny Farrer, John Eichelberry.

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.760
Stomach cancer, suicide, fentanyl.

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:30.320
It's like, whoa, all in a freaking week.

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.840
And I just remember thinking like, what the,

02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:36.000
but when it just heartbreak and you just carry that

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.040
and it's like, ugh, and that's just a short list.

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.240
And I don't say that for sob stories,

02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:43.680
just for a guy that wasn't in the military

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:44.880
or didn't grow up in the inner city,

02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.440
like it's an unusual number of deaths, like close people.

02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:54.240
When Costello went, the craziest thing happened.

02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:56.960
My heart warmed up, it like heated up

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:59.240
and I wasn't on MDMA and I wasn't,

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:03.400
I was just, just the moment he went, he just went whoosh.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.760
And I was like, what the hell is this?

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.680
And it was just, it was like a supernatural experience to me.

02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.520
I just never had that.

02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:11.080
I put my grandfather in the ground.

02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.360
I was a pallbearer at the funeral.

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.280
I've like done that more times than I'd like

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:17.120
to have ever done it.

02:07:17.120 --> 02:07:20.200
And it just heated up with Costello

02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:22.160
and I thought, what the fuck is this?

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:24.120
And it was almost like, and you can make up these,

02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:25.760
we make up these stories about what it is,

02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:28.560
but it was almost like, he was like, all right,

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:31.160
I have to be careful because I will cry here

02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.480
and I don't want to.

02:07:34.240 --> 02:07:37.320
It was almost like he was like all that effort

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.200
because I put in putting so much effort into him.

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:41.240
I was like, all right, you get that back.

02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:44.320
It was like the giant freaking thank you.

02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:46.360
And it was incredible, you know,

02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.280
and I'm not embarrassed to shed a tear or two about it

02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:50.760
if I have to, like, I was like, holy shit.

02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:53.400
Like that's how close I was to that animal.

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:57.040
Where do you think you can find that kind of love again?

02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.440
Man, I don't know.

02:07:58.440 --> 02:08:01.480
I mean, when, and excuse me for welling up,

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.680
but it was just, I mean, it's a frigging dog, right?

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:04.640
I get it.

02:08:04.640 --> 02:08:09.160
But for me, it was the first real home I ever had.

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:13.400
But when Costello went, it was like,

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:15.880
we'd had this home in Topanga, we'd set it up

02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:17.920
and we're like, and he was just so happy there.

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:21.440
And I think it just, I don't know,

02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:25.920
it was like this weird, like victory slash massive loss.

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.280
Like, we did it, 11 years.

02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.400
We can did everything, everything to make him

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:33.360
as comfortable as possible.

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:35.120
And he was super loyal, beautiful animal,

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.840
but also just funny and fun.

02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:39.960
And I was like, I did it.

02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:43.520
Like, you know, I gave as much of myself to this being

02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:47.360
as a human, I felt I could without making it, you know,

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:51.120
you know, detracting from the rest of my life.

02:08:51.120 --> 02:08:53.720
And he loved, and so I don't know,

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:55.800
when I think about Barbara, especially,

02:08:57.120 --> 02:08:59.000
I well up and it's hard for me,

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.320
but I mean, I talked to her before she died

02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:02.800
and that was a brutal conversation,

02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:06.200
saying goodbye to someone, especially with kids.

02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:09.000
And that was hard.

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:15.640
I think that really flipped a switch in me

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:17.560
where I'm like, I always knew I wanted kids.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.160
I say, I want kids, I want a lot of kids.

02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:20.520
That flipped a switch in me.

02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:22.840
I was like, I want kids, I want my own kids.

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.520
You might be able to find that kind of love.

02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:26.760
Yeah, I think it, cause it was the caretaking.

02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:29.640
It wasn't about what he gave me all that time.

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.920
And the more I could take care of him and see him happy,

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.240
the better I felt, it was crazy.

02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:36.320
And I don't know.

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:40.560
So I miss him every day, every day.

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.560
I miss him every day.

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:45.960
You're, you got a heart that's so full of love.

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:48.560
I can't wait for you to have kids.

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:49.400
Thanks man.

02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.240
For you to be a father.

02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:52.120
Yeah, well, when I'm ready for it,

02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:57.120
when, you know, when God decides I'm ready, I'll have them.

02:09:58.720 --> 02:10:01.320
And then I will still beat you to it,

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.120
as I told you many times before.

02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:07.920
I think you should absolutely have kids.

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:10.000
I mean, look at the people in our life,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.840
cause we're kind of the,

02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:13.120
in case you haven't realized it already,

02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:17.040
like we're the younger of the podcasters,

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:22.040
but you know, like Joe and Peter and Segura and, you know,

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.080
and the rest, right?

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:29.160
They're like the tribal elders, right?

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:32.640
And we're, you know, we're not the youngest in the crew,

02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:36.680
but we're, if you look at all those guys,

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:38.480
they all have kids.

02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.160
They all adore their kids.

02:10:41.160 --> 02:10:43.880
And their kids bring tremendous meaning to their life.

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.400
Like we'd be morons if, you know,

02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.320
if you didn't go off and start a family,

02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.120
I didn't start a family.

02:10:53.080 --> 02:10:55.560
And yeah, I think that's the goal.

02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.640
I mean, I think of the goals, that's one of them.

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:01.920
The kids not only make their life more joyful

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.240
and brings love to their life,

02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.560
it's also makes them more productive,

02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:05.920
makes them better people, all of that.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.240
It's like, it's kind of obvious.

02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:10.080
Yeah.

02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:11.360
I think that's what Costello wanted.

02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:12.760
I think I have this story in my head

02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:16.120
that he was just like, okay, like take this, like you can.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:16.960
Yeah.

02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:18.800
And don't fuck this up.

02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.640
Lord knows, don't fuck this up.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.040
Andrew, I love you, brother.

02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:23.880
This is incredible.

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:24.800
Love you too, thanks.

02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.040
I appreciate you.

02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:29.240
Let's, we will talk often on each other's podcast

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.400
for many years to come.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:31.240
Yes.

02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:32.080
Many, many years to come.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:32.920
Thank you.

02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:34.160
Thanks for having me on here.

02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:37.480
And there are no words for how much I appreciate

02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:38.840
your example and your friendship.

02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.120
So love you, brother.

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:40.960
Love you too.

02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.760

And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:54.240
In the midst of winter,

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:58.120
I found there was within me an invincible summer.

02:11:58.120 --> 02:11:59.520
And that makes me happy.

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:01.880
For it says that no matter how hard the world

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:04.280
pushes against me, within me,

02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:07.120
there's something stronger, something better.

02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:10.160
Pushing right back.

02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:13.120
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
