00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
The following is a conversation with Bhaskar Sankara.

00:02.800 --> 00:08.720
He's a democratic socialist, a political writer, founding editor of Jacobin, president of the

00:08.720 --> 00:14.080
nation, former vice chair of the Democratic Socialist of America, and the author of The

00:14.080 --> 00:19.840
Socialist Manifesto, the case for radical politics in an era of extreme inequality.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.800
As a side note, let me say that this conversation with Bhaskar Sankara,

00:24.800 --> 00:29.520
who's a brilliant socialist writer and philosopher, represents what I hope to do with this podcast.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.240
I hope to talk to the left and the right, to the far left and the far right, always with the goal

00:36.240 --> 00:40.240
of presenting and understanding both the strongest interpretation of their ideas

00:40.880 --> 00:44.400
and valuable thought-provoking arguments against those ideas.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.040
Also, I hope to understand the human being behind the ideas.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.880
I trust in your intelligence as the listener to use the ideas you hear to help you learn,

00:54.880 --> 00:57.760
to think, to empathize, and to make up your own mind.

00:58.880 --> 01:06.480
I will often fall short in pushing back too hard or not pushing back enough, of not bringing up

01:06.480 --> 01:12.080
topics I should have, of talking too much, of interrupting too much, or maybe sometimes,

01:12.080 --> 01:17.440
in the rare cases, not enough, of being too silly on a serious topic, or being too serious

01:17.440 --> 01:23.680
on a silly topic. I'm trying to do my best, and I will keep working my ass off to improve.

01:24.960 --> 01:31.200
In this way, I hope to talk to prominent figures in the political space, even controversial ones,

01:31.200 --> 01:36.160
on both the left and the right. For example, I hope to talk to Donald Trump

01:36.160 --> 01:42.640
and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, to Ron DeSantis and Barack Obama, and of course,

01:42.640 --> 01:48.720
many others across the political spectrum. I sometimes hear accusations about me being

01:48.720 --> 01:55.440
controlled in some way by a government or an intelligence agency, like CIA, FSB,

01:55.440 --> 02:00.960
Mossad, or perhaps that I'm controlled in some way by the very human desire for money, fame,

02:00.960 --> 02:07.360
power, access. All I have is my silly little words, but let me give them to you.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.600
I'm not and will never be controlled by anyone. There's nothing in this world that can break me

02:13.600 --> 02:20.560
and force me to sacrifice my integrity. People call me naive. I'm not naive. I'm optimistic.

02:21.280 --> 02:27.200
And optimism isn't a passive state of being. It's a constant battle against the world that

02:27.200 --> 02:33.600
wants to pull you into a downward spiral of cynicism. To me, optimism is freedom. Freedom

02:33.600 --> 02:39.760
to think, to act, to build, to help, at times, in the face of impossible odds.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.920
As I often do, please allow me to read a few lines from the poem If by Rajar Kipling.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.360
If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.

02:52.080 --> 02:56.400
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.760
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about on dealing lies, or being hated,

03:04.160 --> 03:08.800
don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good or talk too wise.

03:10.160 --> 03:15.280
Even this very poem is mocking my over romantic ridiculousness as I read it.

03:15.280 --> 03:21.120
The meta irony is not lost on me, my friends. I'm a silly little kid trying to do a bit of

03:21.120 --> 03:26.320
good in this world. Thank you for having my back through all of it. All of my mistakes.

03:27.040 --> 03:31.040
Thank you for the love. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.880
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

03:36.880 --> 03:40.400
And now, dear friends, here's Bhaskar Sankara.

03:41.680 --> 03:47.920
Let's start with a big broad question. What is socialism? How do you like to define it?

03:47.920 --> 03:49.200
How do you like to think about it?

03:49.200 --> 03:54.560
Well, there's so many socialists out there and we can't seem to agree about anything. So my

03:54.560 --> 03:58.880
definition, I'm sure, is really just my definition. But I think at the minimum,

03:58.880 --> 04:06.000
socialism is about making sure that the core necessities of life—food, housing, education,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.120
and so on—are guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of being born so that those people

04:11.120 --> 04:16.240
can reach their potential. And I think that's a minimum requirement of socialism.

04:16.240 --> 04:21.120
Beyond that, I think socialism, especially democratic socialism, the type of socialism

04:21.120 --> 04:27.600
that I believe in, is about taking democracy from just the political democratic realm and

04:27.600 --> 04:32.960
extending it into economic and social spheres as well. So if we think that democracy is a good thing,

04:33.680 --> 04:38.640
why do we allow our workplaces to be run in autocratic ways?

04:39.440 --> 04:48.960
So economic, political, social, in all those realms, the ideas, the philosophical ideas apply.

04:49.680 --> 04:57.040
What are, if you can put words to it, what are some philosophical ideas about human beings

04:57.040 --> 04:58.080
that are at the core of this?

04:58.800 --> 05:06.880
I think at the core, it's the idea that we have intrinsic value. We are individuals that have

05:06.880 --> 05:14.000
unequal talents, of course. We're individuals that want different things. But this unique

05:14.000 --> 05:21.360
individualness can only truly come to light in a society in which there are certain collective

05:21.360 --> 05:29.680
or social guarantees. So we could think, just like Stephen Jay Gould, the scientist and socialist,

05:29.680 --> 05:38.480
used to say, about how many thousands of potential Einsteins or Leonardo da Vinci's that died in

05:38.480 --> 05:44.400
sweatshops and on plantations and never got the chance to cultivate what was unique and

05:44.400 --> 05:51.040
human about themselves and also never got a chance to have families and impart what was special and

05:51.040 --> 05:57.120
important to them, to future generations and to posterity. My own grandmother was born in

05:57.120 --> 06:03.520
Trinidad and Tobago. She was illiterate till her dying days in East Orange, New Jersey. She never

06:03.520 --> 06:09.760
had the chance to write down her memories of her life in Trinidad as a young woman and what

06:09.760 --> 06:15.120
it meant. She, of course, had lots of children and she was able to impart some stories to her

06:15.120 --> 06:20.880
children and grandchildren. But I often think about what someone with her wit and intelligence

06:20.880 --> 06:23.680
could have done with a little bit more support.

06:24.480 --> 06:30.480
But if all human beings have intrinsic value, you don't have to be an Einstein for the application

06:30.480 --> 06:35.520
of some of the ideas that you're talking about. Is there a tension or a trade-off between

06:37.280 --> 06:43.040
our human civilization, our society, helping the unlucky versus rewarding

06:44.640 --> 06:46.880
the skillful and the hardworking?

06:47.440 --> 06:51.840
I think you could do both. There's always a balance between the two. I think you could reward

06:51.840 --> 06:57.840
people who make innovations and who improve lives for everyone through their innovations

06:57.840 --> 07:02.320
by giving them, let's say, even more consumption, even that level of inequality,

07:02.320 --> 07:08.640
while still making sure that there's not people in poverty and suffering and while making sure

07:08.640 --> 07:17.040
that, hey, we're going to give these people who want to work that extra 10 hours or 20 hours or

07:17.040 --> 07:24.960
want to apply their hard work some extra benefits, but that these benefits would be

07:25.920 --> 07:28.160
not the extreme disparities that you have today.

07:28.960 --> 07:36.240
So at the core of socialism and maybe democratic socialism is maybe a reallocation of wealth,

07:36.240 --> 07:37.840
reallocation of resources?

07:37.840 --> 07:42.880
I think it's wealth and resources, yes, but it's also power. And I guess one way to think about

07:42.880 --> 07:49.840
this is some thinkers on the right, like Hayek, they would say in their most generous moments,

07:49.840 --> 07:56.000
talking about socialists and socialism, they would say, socialists want to trade some of

07:56.000 --> 08:03.840
your freedom for equality. And that's them trying to just accurately describe what socialism is

08:03.840 --> 08:09.120
trying to do. The way that I would put it, it's a little bit different. Socialists are proposing a

08:09.120 --> 08:13.920
trade-off, but it's really a trade-off between freedom and freedom. And by that, I mean,

08:14.560 --> 08:20.960
let's say you set up a successful business and you set up a business right here in Austin,

08:20.960 --> 08:27.840
Texas, some sort of firm, it's producing some widget or whatever, and it's producing

08:28.720 --> 08:32.800
a good that people really want and demand, but you have some competition.

08:33.920 --> 08:40.400
You decide to hire 20, 30 people to help you. You entered into a free contract with these people

08:41.040 --> 08:47.360
who under capitalism, of course, we're not living in feudalism, have the option to join any other

08:47.360 --> 08:51.440
firm, but they like you and they like this firm and they like your offer. And you're paying them,

08:51.440 --> 09:01.920
let's say $20 an hour for 40 hours of work per week. Now, if the government comes along and says,

09:03.040 --> 09:08.080
okay, there's now a new minimum wage, minimum wage is $22 an hour. And also there's a maximum

09:08.080 --> 09:14.400
work week, 35 hour work week. And if you work someone over 35 hours, even if they agree,

09:14.400 --> 09:21.440
you have to pay them time and a half. Now, that of course is now an abridgment of your freedom as

09:21.440 --> 09:26.720
an entrepreneur, your freedom to set certain terms of employment, to engage in a contract

09:26.720 --> 09:31.520
with free people. But now your workers and other workers in the sector, because if you did it

09:31.520 --> 09:36.320
unilaterally, you just get undercut by your competition. Now, these people now have a few

09:36.320 --> 09:41.680
extra hours a week, they can do whatever they want with. They could watch more NFL with it,

09:41.680 --> 09:45.680
they could spend more time with their friends or family or whatever else. And they're still

09:45.680 --> 09:51.920
getting paid the same, if not better, because the wages also went up. So it's really a question

09:51.920 --> 09:58.400
often of trade-offs between whose freedom and autonomy are you going to prioritize? The freedom

09:58.400 --> 10:05.120
and autonomy of the entrepreneur or the capitalist in this case, or the freedom and autonomy of

10:05.120 --> 10:11.200
ordinary workers. Now, you could create a society that swings so far in the direction of

10:12.800 --> 10:17.920
prioritizing the freedom of one group or one class or whatever else compared to another,

10:17.920 --> 10:22.800
that you end up in some sort of tyranny. Now, if the state said, you know, you Lex,

10:22.800 --> 10:28.400
you're a capitalist, so you don't get the right to vote, or we're going to take away your private

10:28.400 --> 10:34.480
home or your ability to do things that we think are intrinsic human rights. Now, this would be

10:34.480 --> 10:40.880
tyranny. This would be an abridgment of your rights, but shaping your ability in the economic

10:40.880 --> 10:46.880
sphere to be an economic actor is, I think, within the realm and scope of democratic politics.

10:47.680 --> 10:54.400
Yeah. So those are the extremes you're referring to. And one perspective I would like to take

10:54.400 --> 11:01.120
on socialism versus capitalism is under each system, the extremes of each systems and the

11:01.120 --> 11:08.080
moderate versions of each system, how can people take advantage of it? So it seems like no matter

11:08.080 --> 11:13.120
what part of human nature is, whatever the rules, whatever the framework, whatever the system,

11:13.120 --> 11:19.680
somebody is going to take advantage of it. And that's the kind of pragmatic look at it.

11:19.680 --> 11:27.600
In practice, what actually happens? Also, the incentives and the human behavior, what actually

11:27.680 --> 11:32.400
happens in practice under these systems? So if you have a higher and higher minimum wage

11:32.960 --> 11:38.800
and people watch more and more NFL, how does that change their actual behavior as a productive

11:38.800 --> 11:47.200
member of society? And actually at the individual level, as somebody who could be an Einstein

11:47.200 --> 11:53.280
and chooses not to because NFL is so awesome to watch. So is both how do malicious people

11:53.280 --> 12:00.320
that want to take advantage, maybe not malicious, but people that like me are lazy and want to take

12:00.320 --> 12:07.520
advantage. And people that also I think like me, like I tend to believe about myself that I have

12:08.560 --> 12:15.040
potential. And if I let my laziness naturally take over, which it often does,

12:15.040 --> 12:21.440
I won't materialize the potential. So if you make life too easy for me,

12:21.440 --> 12:27.200
I feel like I will never get anything done. Me personally, of course, there's a giant set

12:27.200 --> 12:32.640
of circumstances of the unlucky and the overburden and so on. Okay. So how can

12:33.280 --> 12:36.960
people take advantage of each system, socialism, capitalism?

12:36.960 --> 12:40.480
So for one thing, people are going to take advantage of systems. They're going to find

12:40.480 --> 12:46.640
loopholes. They're going to find ways around. They're going to find ways to at times dominate

12:46.640 --> 12:51.360
and coerce others even in systems meant to get rid of domination and coercion. That's why we

12:51.360 --> 12:57.200
need to design our systems in such a way that it eliminates as many of these things as possible.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.560
And also that's why we need democracy. We need freedom. So in a Soviet system, for instance,

13:03.280 --> 13:08.240
you had the rise of this authoritarian bureaucracy that dominated, of course,

13:08.240 --> 13:15.360
others in the name of socialism. Now that system desperately could have used some

13:15.360 --> 13:19.680
political democracy and some checks on what people were doing and some ability to reverse

13:19.680 --> 13:24.960
their power. And as soon as, of course, little elements of democracy was brought to that system,

13:25.680 --> 13:33.040
the system collapsed because there started to be outlets for dissent and for dissatisfaction.

13:33.040 --> 13:38.480
So I think we can't design a priori a perfect system. We need to be committed to certain

13:38.480 --> 13:45.280
principles that allow systems to be perfected. And for me, that's the importance of democracy.

13:45.280 --> 13:52.240
So even a few years ago, not to go on a tangent, but people were allowed in Chinese authoritarianism

13:52.240 --> 13:56.640
and they're saying China is building this efficient system. The state runs so well.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.760
There's technocratic excellence. Plus, there's just productivity and they're just working harder

14:01.760 --> 14:07.440
than Americans and whatever else. But looking in practice would really happen with COVID,

14:07.440 --> 14:14.480
both the initial suppressing of information about what was happening in Wuhan and the outbreak where

14:14.480 --> 14:19.200
many ordinary Chinese workers and doctors and others were trying to get the word out and they

14:19.200 --> 14:25.200
were suppressed by Communist Party officials locally in Wuhan, probably with the collusion

14:26.480 --> 14:34.000
nationally. And now with zero COVID policies and whatever else. So I think that often we find that

14:34.000 --> 14:41.760
even though it seems like these are weak systems and democracy makes us less competent technocratically

14:41.760 --> 14:46.480
and otherwise, I think it's kind of a necessity for systems to grow and evolve to have that

14:46.480 --> 14:53.840
freedom in civil society. But as for individuals, now the first part of it is, yeah, I think people

14:53.840 --> 14:59.280
should be free to make their own choices. You might have tremendous potential, but you might choose

14:59.280 --> 15:04.240
to spend it in leisure. And leisure doesn't only mean sitting around at home,

15:04.240 --> 15:06.960
drinking a bunch of beers, kind of wasting your life away that way.

15:07.040 --> 15:12.240
Leisure might mean spending more time with your friends and family, building these sort of

15:12.240 --> 15:17.760
relationships that are going to maybe not change the world in some medicines, but will change the

15:17.760 --> 15:23.600
lives of people around you and will change your community for the better. I'm taking notes here

15:23.600 --> 15:28.160
because for me, leisure just meant playing a lot of Skyrim. This whole family relationship that I'm

15:28.160 --> 15:32.640
going to have to work on that. I didn't realize that's also including leisure. I'm going to have

15:32.640 --> 15:37.440
to reconsider my whole life here anyway. Leisure should mean civic activity too,

15:37.440 --> 15:42.080
right? I mean, there's that famous book that Robert Putnam won, Bowling Alone or whatever,

15:42.080 --> 15:48.560
which described it for now. I mean, I was born 1989. I like video and computer games.

15:50.160 --> 15:56.320
So I definitely do that type of leisure too. But I found a lot more richness in my life when

15:56.320 --> 16:01.760
in the last decade, a lot of my leisure has returned to going to the local bar for the

16:01.760 --> 16:06.720
couple drinks I have a week instead of doing it at home alone, watching TV or something,

16:06.720 --> 16:12.080
because you get that random conversation, that sense of a place and belonging.

16:13.840 --> 16:20.320
I guess what's the undercurrent maybe of your question was, now if you have a system with lots

16:20.320 --> 16:26.480
of carrots, but not the whip of, hey, you might be destitute, you might be unemployed, you might not

16:26.480 --> 16:34.880
be able to support yourself unless you're working a certain amount, would we still be as productive?

16:34.880 --> 16:42.880
Would we still be able to generate enough value for society? I think that that's a question that

16:42.880 --> 16:50.720
is quite interesting. I think that we're living in a society now with enough abundance that we

16:50.720 --> 16:57.760
could afford more people deciding to opt out of the system, out of production.

16:58.560 --> 17:06.320
And that the carrots of staying in, more money for consumption, more ability to do

17:06.320 --> 17:12.480
cool things, more just social rewards that comes from being successful or from providing

17:13.120 --> 17:16.640
would be enough. But that's another thing that would have to be balanced in a system.

17:16.640 --> 17:23.200
So if we're seeing mass unemployment by choice in a democratic socialist system,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.560
then you might need to reconfigure the incentives. You might need to encourage

17:28.560 --> 17:32.640
people to go back into production. But that's something that, again, you could do through

17:32.640 --> 17:39.200
democracy and through good governance. You don't have to set the perfect blueprint in motion,

17:40.480 --> 17:45.200
write up a treatise now in 50 years from now, try to follow it like it's scripture.

17:46.160 --> 17:51.040
So by the way, I do like how you said whip instead of stick in Carrot and Stick.

17:52.240 --> 17:59.120
That's putting a weight on the scale of which is better. But yes. But I would actually argue

17:59.120 --> 18:05.200
to push back that the wealthier we get as a society, as a world, that the more comfortable

18:06.080 --> 18:12.880
the social nets become, so the less of a whip or a stick they become.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.040
Because one of the negative consequences, even if you're on welfare, is like, well,

18:17.040 --> 18:24.160
life is not going to be that great. But the wealthier we become, the better the social

18:24.160 --> 18:30.480
programs become, the easier life becomes at the bottom. And so you might not have this

18:31.680 --> 18:38.400
motivation financially to get out from the bottom. That said, the pushback and the pushback

18:38.400 --> 18:43.680
is that there's something about human nature in general, money aside, that strives for greatness,

18:44.320 --> 18:51.200
that strives to provide a great life, a great middle class life for your family.

18:51.200 --> 18:54.560
So that's the motivated to get off from the bottom.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.440
Well, I think a lot of people who are stuck at the bottom of the labor market today,

19:00.640 --> 19:05.520
one, these are people who are kind of are our true philanthropists, because a lot of them are

19:05.520 --> 19:12.400
the ones who are working two jobs and are working 60 plus hours and are providing in this country,

19:12.400 --> 19:17.040
it's such a bargain for their labor because they're so underpaid, so many of the things

19:17.040 --> 19:24.240
that the rest of us use to enjoy life and consumption or whatever else. I got here from

19:24.240 --> 19:30.320
downtown Austin and I think my Lyft, I did tip, but I think my Lyft was like eight bucks base

19:30.320 --> 19:40.240
or whatever else. I think that we are all indebted to people who are working and we

19:40.240 --> 19:47.360
don't see it at various stages of the production process from the workers in China and Taiwan

19:47.360 --> 19:57.440
producing technological things that we're recording this on, to growers and workers

19:57.440 --> 20:03.840
in agriculture in the US. So I think that one, working class people are already working,

20:03.840 --> 20:11.360
but as far as getting out from under poverty and desperation, we're in a society that doesn't

20:11.360 --> 20:20.560
give people a lot of tools. So if you don't have access to good public schools from age five until

20:21.520 --> 20:27.920
12, 13, it's going to be really hard to move from generations of your family being involved

20:27.920 --> 20:33.760
in manual labor to doing other forms of labor. You're going to be stuck at a certain part

20:33.760 --> 20:42.000
of our labor market as a result. If you don't have access to decent health care throughout your life,

20:42.000 --> 20:47.520
you might be already preordained to an early grave by the time that something kicks in,

20:47.520 --> 20:53.200
you really want to change something in your life in your mid-twenties. Obviously, it's a combination

20:53.200 --> 20:59.120
of agency and all these other factors. There's still something I think innately human, innately

20:59.120 --> 21:04.000
striving that a lot of people have, but we don't really give people in our current society the

21:04.000 --> 21:09.760
tools to really be full participants in our society. We just take for granted, for example,

21:09.760 --> 21:14.560
and I'm from the Northeast, so I give excessively Northeast examples, but we take for granted that

21:14.560 --> 21:21.440
someone from Hartford, Connecticut, your average working-class person in Hartford is going to have

21:21.440 --> 21:28.560
a very different life outcome than someone born on the same day, the same hour in Greenwich,

21:28.560 --> 21:35.040
Connecticut. We take for granted that accidents of birth are going to dictate outcomes.

21:35.600 --> 21:41.760
So you mean depending on the conditions of where you grew up, there's going to be fundamentally

21:41.760 --> 21:46.320
different experience in terms of education, in terms of the resources available to you

21:46.880 --> 21:53.440
to allow yourself to flourish? Yes. A poor city and a rich city. Connecticut is great. It's highly,

21:53.440 --> 21:58.800
highly underrated. Both New Yorkers and people from Boston have a colonial feeling about

21:58.800 --> 22:03.440
Connecticut where we make fun of it and we try to carve it up. The West belongs to New York,

22:03.440 --> 22:09.280
the East to Boston, but I'm here for Connecticut nationalism. I think it's a great place.

22:10.080 --> 22:15.280
Okay. Can we actually step back a little bit on definitions? Because you said that

22:16.160 --> 22:20.000
some of the ideas practically that you're playing with is democratic socialism.

22:21.120 --> 22:25.760
We talked about the higher level, the higher kind of vision of socialism,

22:25.760 --> 22:32.960
the ideals, the philosophical ideas, but how does it all fit into the big picture historically

22:32.960 --> 22:41.440
of ideas of Marxism, communism, and socialism as it was defined and experienced and implemented

22:41.440 --> 22:46.080
in the 20th century? So what's your key differences? Maybe even just like socialism,

22:46.080 --> 22:51.280
communism. Yeah. Well, I hate the no true Scotsman sort of response to this, which is,

22:51.760 --> 22:57.440
oh, that socialism is bad. So it wasn't really socialism and my socialism is good. So it is

22:57.440 --> 23:04.160
socialism. But I think that socialism and communism share a common ancestor,

23:04.880 --> 23:13.120
which is they both emerged out of the turmoil and development of late 19th century capitalism

23:13.760 --> 23:19.040
and the fact that there was all these workers parties that were organizing across the capitalist

23:19.040 --> 23:26.480
world. So in Europe, for instance, you had this mass party called the German Social Democratic

23:26.480 --> 23:34.480
Party that became probably the most important, the most vibrant party in Germany in the 1880s

23:34.480 --> 23:40.640
and 1890s, but they were locked out of power because Germany at the time was still mostly

23:40.640 --> 23:47.680
autarkic. It had a parliamentary democracy, but it was a very undemocratic democracy. The Kaiser

23:47.680 --> 23:53.600
still ruled. These movements took root across the capitalist world, but including in Russia

23:53.600 --> 24:00.240
and in conditions of illegality. So it was assumed for many, many years and the workers

24:00.240 --> 24:04.560
movement across Europe and among socialists of Europe, they call themselves social Democrats then

24:05.280 --> 24:11.600
that the revolution would first probably happen in Germany in this developed growing hub of

24:11.600 --> 24:20.240
industrial capitalism and not in semi-feudal Russia. But then war for one came, the workers

24:20.240 --> 24:26.000
movement was split between parties that decided to either keep their head down or to implicitly

24:26.000 --> 24:32.000
support the war and support the war for an hour, keep your heads down, don't get banned,

24:32.000 --> 24:38.320
don't get arrested. Then we'll just take power after the war is over. And those like Russia,

24:38.320 --> 24:44.160
and also in the United States for that matter, they chose the path of resistance to the war.

24:45.120 --> 24:55.440
And it was the Bolshevik faction of the Russian movement, Lenin's Bolshevik party that took power

24:55.440 --> 25:00.320
in Russia after a period of turmoil where it didn't seem, well, was it going to go to the

25:00.320 --> 25:04.560
fascist right or was it going to go to the far left? There was a period of flux and turmoil

25:04.560 --> 25:11.280
in Russia, but definitely the old regime was not able to stand. And these Russian social Democrats,

25:11.280 --> 25:19.200
these Bolsheviks, said social democracy has so betrayed the idea of internationalism and

25:19.200 --> 25:23.040
brotherhood and progress it was supposed to stand for that we can't call ourselves social

25:23.040 --> 25:27.520
Democrats anymore. We're going to go back to this old term that Marx used, we're going to call

25:27.520 --> 25:36.320
ourselves communists. And that's where official kind of communism out of Russia emerged. In other

25:36.320 --> 25:41.440
parts of Europe, parties were actually able to take power, some in the interwar period,

25:41.440 --> 25:47.600
but most in the postwar period. And they also came out of this old social democratic movement.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.800
And these parties mostly just call themselves socialists. And a lot of them still on paper

25:52.800 --> 25:58.400
wanted to go beyond capitalism. But in practice, they just managed capitalism better in the

25:58.400 --> 26:05.680
interests of workers. But they all had the same common ancestor. And in practice, to me,

26:06.400 --> 26:12.960
social democracy means trying to insert doses of socialism within capitalism,

26:12.960 --> 26:19.840
but maintaining capitalism. Communism meant this attempt to build a socialism outside of capitalism

26:19.840 --> 26:27.200
and often authoritarian ways, in part because of the ideology of these communists, but in part

26:27.200 --> 26:30.800
because of the conditions in which they inherited. They were inheriting a democracy,

26:30.800 --> 26:38.240
they were inheriting a country that had been ruled by the Tsars for centuries. And with very

26:38.240 --> 26:44.560
little condition, like a very weak working class, very poor and devastated by war, and so on,

26:44.560 --> 26:51.120
where authoritarianism kind of lended itself to those conditions. And then there's me,

26:51.120 --> 26:53.680
then there's democratic socialists. And the way I would define it is,

26:54.160 --> 26:59.360
we like a lot of what the social democrats accomplished, but we still believe in going

26:59.360 --> 27:04.960
beyond capitalism. And not just building socialism within capitalism, but we believe in this ultimate

27:04.960 --> 27:11.840
vision of a world after capitalism. What does that world look like? And how's it different

27:11.840 --> 27:16.720
from communism? Actually, maybe we can linger before we talk about your vision of democratic

27:16.720 --> 27:23.280
socialism. What was wrong with communism, Stalinism, implementation of communism in

27:23.280 --> 27:29.520
the Soviet Union? Why did it go wrong? And in what ways did it not go wrong? In what ways did it

27:29.520 --> 27:34.000
succeed? Let me start with the second part of that question. And that's a very difficult one

27:34.000 --> 27:41.520
to answer in part because I morally and ethically am opposed to any form of authoritarianism or

27:41.520 --> 27:47.440
dictatorship. And often when you talk about the successes of a government or what it did

27:47.440 --> 27:52.080
developmentally that might've been positive, we have to abstract ourselves from what we

27:52.080 --> 28:00.000
morally believe and just kind of look at the record, right? I would say that the Soviet

28:00.000 --> 28:08.960
experiment started off in Lenin's time as the attempt to kind of just hold a holding action.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.920
Hey, we don't really have the conditions to rule this country. We have the support of the

28:13.920 --> 28:21.040
working class or most of it, but the working class is only 3% of the population. The peasantry is

28:21.040 --> 28:26.080
really against us. A lot of this 3% of the population has died in war and half of them

28:26.080 --> 28:32.800
supported the Mensheviks and the more moderate socialists anyway. But the alternative in their

28:32.800 --> 28:40.160
minds was going to be a far right reaction, some sort of general taking power in a coup

28:40.160 --> 28:45.360
or whatever else, or just them ending up back in prison because a lot of them were in prison

28:45.360 --> 28:51.200
under the Tsar or just killed. So they figured, all right, we're going to have a holding action

28:51.200 --> 28:58.560
where we maintain as much of this territory of the old Russian empire as possible. We'll try to

28:59.120 --> 29:04.320
slowly implement changes, restabilize the economy through something called the New Economic Program,

29:04.320 --> 29:10.720
which was kind of a form of social democracy, if you will, because it allowed market exchange for

29:10.720 --> 29:18.320
the peasants combined with state ownership of industries in the cities. And for a while,

29:18.320 --> 29:22.880
it seemed to be working. The revolution never came that they were expecting in Western Europe,

29:22.880 --> 29:27.440
but in Russia itself, they were able to restabilize things by the middle or end of

29:27.440 --> 29:33.040
the 1920s. And they were able to build more of a popular base for some of their policies because

29:33.040 --> 29:39.040
people who had seen the chaos of World War I and revolution and then civil war,

29:39.040 --> 29:44.800
kind of just wanted stability. And after a decade plus of war, if you had a government that was

29:44.800 --> 29:52.000
able to give you enough to eat and a job, that was good enough for them. Then Stalin came into

29:52.000 --> 29:58.240
power and he wanted to rapidly industrialize. And his logic was the revolution's not going to

29:58.240 --> 30:03.520
come in the West. We need to build socialism in one country and we need to catch up with the West.

30:03.520 --> 30:08.240
We need to turn ourselves into an industrial powerhouse as quickly as possible. And that's

30:08.240 --> 30:14.640
where you got forced collectivization to try to increase the productivity of Russian agriculture

30:14.640 --> 30:20.800
through state ownership of previously fragmented agricultural holdings and through the

30:22.480 --> 30:26.960
implementation of mechanization. So bring in more machines to make agriculture more productive,

30:26.960 --> 30:33.280
all under state ownership, plus more ambitious attempts to build heavy industry through

30:33.280 --> 30:39.680
five-year plans. Now, I say this kind of coolly, but we know in practice what that meant.

30:39.680 --> 30:45.440
Forced collectivization was a disaster. I mean, first of all, I think was built on the faulty

30:45.440 --> 30:51.520
premise that scale always equals more productivity when in fact, especially in agriculture,

30:51.520 --> 30:56.400
but in any field, it's a little bit more complicated than that. And it led to millions of deaths,

30:56.400 --> 31:03.200
led to famine, it led to a host of other problems. Industrialization in the way that it happened

31:03.200 --> 31:10.160
under Stalin also kind of unbalanced the Soviet economy to lean too heavy towards heavy industry,

31:10.160 --> 31:19.520
not enough for medium or light industry. But this did mean especially the five-year plan

31:19.520 --> 31:27.120
industrialization did manage to put Russia on a different developmental trajectory.

31:28.160 --> 31:35.120
So by the time the post-war period came, one, it might have gave them the ability to survive

31:35.120 --> 31:38.800
the Nazi invasion to begin with. That's a complicated question. And then by the time

31:38.800 --> 31:45.200
the post-war period came, Russia had kind of jumped ahead of its developmental trajectory in a way that

31:45.280 --> 31:49.920
a lot of other countries didn't do. There are a few examples, like Japan is one that managed to.

31:49.920 --> 31:57.360
If you kind of ran a scenario where Japan would be in the 1870s, 1880s and ran it a hundred times,

31:57.360 --> 32:02.720
the Japan and post-war period is kind of one of the best outcomes, right? And I think that you

32:02.720 --> 32:09.440
could say that about Russian economic development, its ability to catch up at a certain level to the

32:09.440 --> 32:18.240
West. And then after that, of course, later on, as economies got more complex, as they kind of moved

32:18.240 --> 32:24.720
beyond regular heavy industry and as the main stable of the economy, the Russian economy

32:24.720 --> 32:29.040
in its command system was unable to adapt and cope and ended up falling back behind

32:29.760 --> 32:36.240
the West again by the 1970s. So all this is a very long story to say that a lot went wrong.

32:36.320 --> 32:40.320
In Russia, the economic picture is actually a little bit more complicated. Politically,

32:41.440 --> 32:47.200
I think it's just a small party without much popular support, but with real popular support

32:47.200 --> 32:54.960
in a couple of cities, but without a lot of popular support, empire-wide took power and they felt they

32:54.960 --> 33:01.360
couldn't give back power. And they kept holding on to power. And eventually among their ranks

33:01.360 --> 33:08.400
in these conditions, one of history's great tyrants took power and was able to justify

33:08.400 --> 33:14.560
what he was doing in the context of the Russian nation and development, but also all the threats

33:14.560 --> 33:21.040
that came from abroad. The Civil War wasn't just a Civil War. It was really an invasion by many

33:21.040 --> 33:27.520
imperial powers all around the world as well. So I think a lot of it was conditions and circumstance.

33:27.760 --> 33:35.120
And I guess the question really is to what role ideology played? Is there something within the

33:35.120 --> 33:39.600
socialist tradition that might have lent itself to authoritarianism? And that's something we should

33:40.160 --> 33:48.400
talk about. And that's a really complicated human question. It does seem that the rhetoric,

33:48.480 --> 33:55.600
the populism of workers unite. We've been fucked over for way too long.

33:56.400 --> 34:05.920
Let's stand together. Somehow that message allows flawed or evil people to take power.

34:07.040 --> 34:13.520
It seems like the rhetoric, the idea is so good. Maybe the utopian nature of the idea is so good

34:13.520 --> 34:20.400
that allows a great speaker to take power. It's almost like if the mission,

34:22.400 --> 34:29.440
come with me, friends, beyond the horizon, a great land is waiting for us. That encourages

34:30.640 --> 34:36.640
dictators, authoritarians to take power. Is there something within the ideology that allows for that,

34:36.640 --> 34:43.760
for the sort of for lying to people, essentially? Well, I might surprise you with my answer,

34:43.760 --> 34:52.400
because I would say, yes, maybe. But I think that it's not just socialism. Any sort of ideology

34:52.400 --> 35:02.080
that appeals to the collective and appeals to our long term destiny, either as a species or as a

35:02.080 --> 35:06.800
nation or as a class or whatever else, can lend itself to authoritarianism.

35:07.600 --> 35:13.440
You can see this in many of the nationalisms of the 20th century. Now, some of these nationalisms

35:14.160 --> 35:21.200
use incredibly lofty collective rhetoric, like in Sweden, the rhetoric of we're going to create

35:21.200 --> 35:26.000
the people's home. We're going to make this a country with dignity for all Swedes. We're going

35:26.000 --> 35:30.960
to make this a country that's more developed, more free, and so on. And they managed to build

35:30.960 --> 35:38.240
a pretty excellent society, in my estimation, from that. In countries like fascist Germany

35:38.240 --> 35:43.200
and Italy, they managed to do horrendous things in Japan and horrendous things with that.

35:43.920 --> 35:52.400
In the US, with national popular appeals, FDR was able to unite a nation to elevate ordinary

35:52.400 --> 35:56.640
working class people into a position where they felt like they had a real stake in the country.

35:57.200 --> 36:05.280
And I think did great things with the New Deal. In Russia, of course, this language was used

36:05.280 --> 36:14.960
to trample upon individual rights and to justify hardship and abuses of ordinary individual people

36:14.960 --> 36:20.640
in the name of a collective destiny. A destiny, of course, that was just decided by the party in

36:20.640 --> 36:31.120
power and during the 30s and 40s by Justall and himself, really. Now, I think that that's really

36:31.120 --> 36:37.600
the case for making sure that we have a bedrock of civil rights and democracy. And then on top

36:37.600 --> 36:44.240
of that, we can debate. We can debate different national destinies. We can debate different

36:44.240 --> 36:50.080
appeals, different visions of the world. But as long as people have a say in what sacrifices

36:50.080 --> 36:55.600
they're being asked to do, and as long as those sacrifices don't take away what's fundamentally

36:55.600 --> 37:09.440
ours, which is our life, which is our basic rights. And voice, our voice. So this complicated picture,

37:10.400 --> 37:20.240
because help me understand. You mentioned that social democracy is trying to have social policies

37:20.240 --> 37:28.640
within a capitalist system in part, but your vision, your hope for a social democracy is one

37:28.640 --> 37:35.680
that goes beyond that. How do you give everybody a voice while not becoming the Soviet Union,

37:36.640 --> 37:43.040
while not becoming where basically people are silenced either directly through violence

37:43.040 --> 37:46.240
or through the implied threat of violence and therefore fear?

37:46.960 --> 37:52.080
So I think you need to limit the scope of where the state is and what the state can do and how

37:52.080 --> 38:00.080
the state functions, first of all. Now, for me, social democracy was like the equivalent of,

38:00.960 --> 38:07.120
I'll give a football analogy. It was the equivalent of getting to the red zone and then

38:07.120 --> 38:11.920
kicking a field goal. You'll take the three points, but you would have rather got a touchdown. And

38:11.920 --> 38:16.400
for me, socialism would be the touchdown. It's not a separate, different playing field.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.720
Some people would say socialism would be an interception.

38:19.600 --> 38:26.240
Sure, sure. No, and they would have the right to, again, to say that and to say,

38:26.240 --> 38:33.360
we shouldn't go further. And most coaches would take the safe route, right? So you're going

38:34.560 --> 38:42.640
against the decision. Anyway, I understand. I understand. So for you, the goal is full

38:42.640 --> 38:48.960
socialism. But I'll take the three points. I just want to march down the field. I want to get within

38:48.960 --> 38:53.920
scoring position. The reason why we should really move from this analogy, but the reason why

38:54.720 --> 39:00.960
I call myself a socialist is looking through history and these examples of social democracy,

39:00.960 --> 39:07.600
you saw that they were able to give working class people lots of rights and income and power in

39:07.600 --> 39:12.960
their society. But at the end of the day, capitalists still have the ultimate power, which is

39:13.520 --> 39:20.880
the ability to withhold investment. So they could say in the late 1960s and early 70s,

39:21.760 --> 39:28.800
listen, I was fine with this arrangement 10 years ago, but now I feel like I'm going to take my

39:28.800 --> 39:33.520
money and I'm going to go move to a different country or I'm just going to not invest because

39:33.520 --> 39:38.800
my workers are paid too much. I'm still making money, but I feel like I could be making more.

39:38.800 --> 39:46.080
I need more of an upper hand, right? So their economic power is then challenging the democratic

39:46.080 --> 39:51.120
mandate of Swedish workers that were voting for the Social Democratic Party and were behind this

39:51.840 --> 39:58.640
advance. So to me, what socialism is in part is taking the means of production where this

39:58.640 --> 40:04.720
capitalist power is coming from and making it socially owned so that ordinary workers

40:04.720 --> 40:12.880
can control their workplaces, can make investment decisions and so on. Now, does that mean total

40:12.880 --> 40:17.600
state ownership of everything or a planned economy? I don't think that makes any sense.

40:17.600 --> 40:24.240
I think that we should live in a society in which markets are harnessed and regulated and so on.

40:24.240 --> 40:32.560
My main problem is capitalist ownership in part on normative grounds, just because I think that

40:32.560 --> 40:37.360
it doesn't make sense that we celebrate democracy and all these other spheres, but we have workplaces

40:38.000 --> 40:44.800
that are just treated like tyrannies and in part because I think that ordinary workers

40:44.800 --> 40:51.920
would much prefer a system in which over time they accrued shares and ownership where they got,

40:51.920 --> 40:57.200
in addition to base kind of ways, they got dividends from their firm being successful

40:58.000 --> 41:02.560
and that they figured out how to, you know, large firms, they're not going to be making

41:02.560 --> 41:07.840
day-to-day decisions by democratic vote, right? But maybe you would elect representatives,

41:07.840 --> 41:13.040
elected managements once every year or two, depending on your operating agreement and so

41:13.040 --> 41:19.920
on. That's kind of my vision of a socialist society and this sounds, I hope, like agree or

41:19.920 --> 41:26.080
disagree, like it would not be a crazy leap into year zero, right? That this could be maybe a way

41:26.080 --> 41:31.120
in which we could take a lot of what's existing in society but then just add this on top. But

41:31.200 --> 41:38.240
what it would mean is a society without a capitalist class. This class hasn't been,

41:38.240 --> 41:44.480
you know, individually these people, you know, haven't been taken to re-education camps or

41:45.920 --> 41:52.080
whatever else, but they're just no longer in this position and they're now part of the economy in

41:52.080 --> 41:57.920
other ways. Like they'll probably be the first set of highly competent technocrats and managers and

41:57.920 --> 42:03.600
so on. They'll probably be very well compensated for their time and expertise and whatever else.

42:04.160 --> 42:11.760
But to me, both the practical end of things like taking away this ability to withhold investment

42:11.760 --> 42:19.120
and increasing our ability to democratically shape investment priorities and to continue down the

42:19.120 --> 42:26.000
road of social democracy and on normative grounds by kind of egalitarian belief that ordinary people

42:26.000 --> 42:33.440
should have more stake in their lives in the workplace leads me beyond social democracy to

42:33.440 --> 42:40.400
socialism. So there's a tricky thing here. So in Ukraine especially, but in the Soviet Union,

42:40.400 --> 42:49.040
there's the Kulaks. The possible trajectory of fighting for the beautiful message of respecting

42:49.040 --> 42:59.120
workers' rights has this dynamic of making an enemy of the capitalist class, too easily making

42:59.120 --> 43:08.160
an enemy of the capitalist class, with a central leader, populist leader, that says the rich and

43:08.160 --> 43:14.000
the powerful, they're taking advantage of you. We need to remove them. We need to put them in camps,

43:14.000 --> 43:20.960
perhaps, not set explicitly until it happens. It can happen overnight, but just putting a giant

43:20.960 --> 43:27.920
pressure on that capitalist class. And again, the Stalin-type figure takes hold. So I'm trying to

43:27.920 --> 43:35.360
understand how the mechanism can prevent that. And perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias here

43:35.360 --> 43:41.200
as I've been reading, I was going to say too much, maybe not enough, but a lot about

43:42.160 --> 43:46.400
books like Stalin's War in Ukraine and just I've been reading a lot about the 30s and the 40s

43:47.680 --> 43:53.120
for personal reasons related to my travels in Ukraine and all that kind of stuff. So I have a

43:53.120 --> 43:59.040
little bit of a focus on the historical implementations of communism currently without

43:59.040 --> 44:03.440
kind of an updated view of all the possible future implementation. So I just want to lay

44:03.440 --> 44:11.360
that out there, but I worry about the slippery slope into the authoritarian figure that takes

44:11.360 --> 44:17.440
the sexy message, destroys everyone who's powerful in the name of the working class,

44:18.000 --> 44:23.920
and then fucks the working class afterwards. So first of all, I think it's worth remembering

44:23.920 --> 44:30.480
that the socialist movement had different outcomes across Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And in

44:30.480 --> 44:35.440
some of these countries in Western Europe, there wasn't actually democracy before the workers

44:35.440 --> 44:42.000
movement and before the socialist movement. So the battle in Sweden, for instance, was about

44:42.000 --> 44:46.400
establishing political democracy, establishing true representation for workers. And that's how

44:46.400 --> 44:52.480
the parties became popular. Same thing in Germany too. Then it was the social Democrats who were

44:52.480 --> 44:58.640
able to build political democracy. Then on top of that, add layers of economic democracy,

44:59.520 --> 45:07.280
social democracy. The Swedish social Democrats ruled basically uninterrupted from the early 1930s

45:07.280 --> 45:12.400
until 1976. It's kind of crazy to think about, but they were just in government. They were the

45:12.400 --> 45:16.640
leading member of government that a few different coalition partners would shift. Sometimes they

45:16.640 --> 45:22.560
were with the agrarians, sometimes they were with the communists briefly, but they ruled

45:22.560 --> 45:28.160
uninterrupted and they lost an election in 1976 and they just left power. Then they got back into

45:28.160 --> 45:34.000
power in the 80s. So in other words, they created a democratic system, of course, with mass support

45:34.000 --> 45:39.600
of working class people. Then they truly honored the system because when they lost power, they

45:39.600 --> 45:46.000
lost power. They left power. There's plenty of cases like that across Europe and the world and

45:46.000 --> 45:50.160
in other countries like Korea and elsewhere, where the workers movements, the most militant,

45:50.160 --> 45:57.440
the most class centric workers, South Africa is the same way, created democratic systems.

45:58.400 --> 46:03.440
Now Russia, I think a lot of what happened had to do with the fact that it was never a democratic

46:03.440 --> 46:10.160
country. It was ruled by a party and the party itself was very easy to shift from a somewhat

46:10.160 --> 46:16.240
democratic party in Lenin's day to an authoritarian one in Russia. There was no distinction then

46:16.240 --> 46:21.040
between the party and the state. So your authoritarian party then became authoritarian

46:21.040 --> 46:29.200
total control over the entirety of the state. Now the fact that the Soviet system involved total

46:29.200 --> 46:35.600
state ownership of production meant that the authoritarianism of the party state could go

46:35.600 --> 46:42.000
even deeper into the lives of ordinary people compared to other horrific dictatorships like

46:42.000 --> 46:48.400
Pinochet's Chile and so on, when maybe you could find some solace just at home or whatever else.

46:48.480 --> 46:55.440
You didn't have the same sort of totalitarian control of people's lives,

46:56.720 --> 47:00.880
but I would say that socialism itself has yielded different outcomes. Now on the question of

47:00.880 --> 47:09.760
polarization, I guess that implies that this polarization, this distinction is a distinction

47:09.760 --> 47:15.280
that isn't real in society and that is kind of being manufactured or generated.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.640
You mean the capitalist class and the working class, just to clarify? Yeah, okay.

47:18.640 --> 47:27.040
So in certain populist distinctions, the division is basically arbitrary or made up. The us versus

47:27.040 --> 47:33.600
them polarization, depending who the us and who the them are, it's truly something that's

47:33.600 --> 47:42.320
manufactured. But capitalism itself as a system based on class division, whether you support it

47:42.320 --> 47:47.440
or oppose it, I think we should acknowledge it's based on class division, that is the thing

47:47.440 --> 47:53.520
creating that polarization. Now, I think what a lot of what socialists try to do is we try to

47:54.720 --> 48:01.040
take bits of working class opposition to capitalism, to their lives, to the way they're

48:01.040 --> 48:08.240
treated at work and so on. And yes, we do try to organize on those bases to help workers take

48:08.240 --> 48:16.000
collective action, to help them organize in political parties and so on to represent their

48:16.000 --> 48:22.880
interests, economic and otherwise. But the contradiction exists to begin with. And if anything,

48:23.440 --> 48:29.760
this system, which I'm proposing, democratic socialism, would be kind of a resolution of this

48:29.760 --> 48:35.440
conflict, this dilemma, this thing that has always existed since chieftain and follower and so on.

48:35.440 --> 48:40.640
We've had class division since the Neolithic Revolution. I think this is a democratic road

48:40.640 --> 48:46.080
out of that tension and that division of humanity and to people who own and people have nothing to

48:46.080 --> 48:52.960
give but their ability to work. So that idea is grounded in going all the way back to Marx, that

48:52.960 --> 48:58.560
all of human history can be told through the lens of class struggle. Is there some sense,

48:58.560 --> 49:05.840
can you still man the case that this class difference is over exaggerated, that there's

49:05.840 --> 49:14.160
a difference but it's not the difference of the abuser and the abused. It's more of a difference of

49:15.920 --> 49:20.480
people that were successful and people that were less successful.

49:20.480 --> 49:26.960
So I'll play devil's advocate, which is that maybe one could argue that in its purest,

49:26.960 --> 49:33.840
earliest stage, capitalism was based on a stark difference. But then since then, two things have

49:33.840 --> 49:40.240
happened. One, a bunch of socialists and workers have organized to guarantee certain rights for

49:40.240 --> 49:46.800
working class people, certain protections. So in our system now, there are certain safety nets,

49:46.800 --> 49:51.920
less in the US than in other countries, but in a lot of countries are pretty extensive safety nets.

49:51.920 --> 49:58.320
Even like 40 hour work week, minimum wage, safety regulations, all that kind of stuff.

49:58.320 --> 50:03.920
And all those things are, in my mind, doses of socialism within capitalism, because what you're

50:03.920 --> 50:10.000
doing is you are taking the autonomy of capitalists to do whatever they want with the people

50:10.000 --> 50:15.840
contracted to them. And the only thing stopping them is them potentially being able to go to

50:15.840 --> 50:20.160
another employer. But even then, it's kind of a potentially a race to the bottom if

50:20.720 --> 50:27.440
you can't get more than $2 an hour from any employer in your market, you're going to have

50:27.440 --> 50:35.600
to live with it. So one factor is we have built in those protections. So we've taken enough

50:35.600 --> 50:41.840
socialism into capitalism that you could say that at a certain point, maybe it makes a qualitative

50:41.840 --> 50:46.720
difference and not just a quantitative difference in people's lives. The other thing is over time,

50:46.720 --> 50:54.560
we've gotten wealthier and more productive as a society. So maybe at some point, the quantitative

50:54.560 --> 51:01.280
difference of just more and more wealth means that even if in the abstract, the division between

51:01.280 --> 51:06.720
a worker and a capitalist is real, if that worker is earning a quarter million dollars a year

51:06.720 --> 51:10.960
and has a good life and only has to clock in 35 hours a week, 30 hours a week,

51:11.680 --> 51:18.000
and has four weeks of vacation, then isn't it just an abstract or philosophical

51:19.440 --> 51:23.840
difference? So I think you could level those two arguments. What I would say is that one,

51:26.320 --> 51:31.280
a lot of these rights that we have fought for are constantly being eroded and they're under attack,

51:31.840 --> 51:38.480
in part because the economic power the capitalists have bleeds into our political democracy as well.

51:38.480 --> 51:44.320
There's constant lobbying for all sorts of labor market deregulations and so on.

51:45.200 --> 51:51.280
I fundamentally believe that if tomorrow all those regulations went away,

51:51.840 --> 51:57.840
capitalists would fight to pay people as little as possible and we'd be back in 19th century

51:57.840 --> 52:04.240
capitalism. And not because they're bad people, because if I'm running a firm and all of a sudden

52:04.240 --> 52:10.800
my competition is able to find a labor pool and is paying people less than me, I'm going to be

52:10.800 --> 52:15.920
undercut because they'll be able to take some of that extra savings and invest into new technology

52:15.920 --> 52:21.840
or whatever else and they'll gobble up my market share before long. And then also beyond that,

52:21.840 --> 52:30.240
I do think there's a normative question here, which is now, do we believe that ordinary people

52:30.240 --> 52:36.000
have a capacity to be able to make certain decisions about their work? Do we believe they

52:36.000 --> 52:42.000
know more about their work than their bosses? Now, I don't think that's not true at every level,

52:42.000 --> 52:49.040
but I think there's no doubt that in workplaces workers know how to productively do their task

52:49.040 --> 52:52.800
in ways that their manager might not know. I think we've all been in workplaces where we've

52:52.800 --> 53:00.320
had managers who kind of don't know what you do or whatever else. And I think that collectively,

53:00.320 --> 53:06.960
if incentivized, we could have them, one, instead of hoarding that information,

53:08.160 --> 53:13.680
since they're getting a stake in production and so on, they'd be able to more freely share it and

53:13.680 --> 53:20.000
be able to reshape how their day-to-day work happens. And also with elected managers,

53:20.000 --> 53:26.560
you kind of take that up the chain. I think you would have perfectly efficient market-based firms

53:28.240 --> 53:35.040
that could exist without capitalists. So there's a lot of things to say,

53:35.920 --> 53:41.360
maybe within just very, very low-level question of if the workers are running the show,

53:43.360 --> 53:48.320
there's a brutal truth to the fact that some people are better, and the workers know this,

53:49.120 --> 53:53.120
it's the Steve Jobs, A-players, you want to have all the A-players in the room

53:53.120 --> 53:58.160
because one B-player can poison the pool because then everybody gets demotivated by

54:02.080 --> 54:10.000
the nature of that lack of excellence and competence. This is just to take

54:10.000 --> 54:17.040
sort of a crude devil's advocate perspective. Are the workers going to be able to remove

54:17.040 --> 54:24.000
the incompetent from the pool in the name, in the goal of towards the mission of succeeding

54:24.000 --> 54:29.680
as a collective? So I think that any successful model of socialism that involves a market,

54:29.680 --> 54:36.720
you need two things. One is at the micro level, you need the ability to fire people and for them

54:36.720 --> 54:44.000
to exit firms, which might be a slower process in cooperative-based firms than it is in a

54:44.000 --> 54:47.920
capitalist firm without a union, but it would be probably akin to the process that would happen

54:47.920 --> 54:53.600
in a capitalist firm of which there are many with unions. So you need that. And then at the macro

54:53.600 --> 55:01.120
level, you need firm failure. You need to avoid a dilemma that happened in Soviet-style economies,

55:01.120 --> 55:09.040
which was soft-budget constraints and firms basically not being allowed to fail because

55:09.040 --> 55:13.360
the government was committed to full employment, the firms employed people, so even inefficient

55:13.360 --> 55:17.760
firms where at the end of the day, they knew they were going to be propped up by the government

55:17.760 --> 55:22.000
and they would be given all the resources they would need no matter how inefficiently they were

55:22.000 --> 55:28.400
using those resources to maintain employment. So I think you need both. Do you worry about

55:28.400 --> 55:33.920
this idea of firing people? Man, I'm uncomfortable with the idea. I hate it,

55:33.920 --> 55:39.920
but I also know it's extremely necessary. So is there something about a collective,

55:39.920 --> 55:47.200
a socialist system that makes firing, you said it might be slower, might it become extremely slow,

55:47.840 --> 55:53.040
too much friction? Isn't there a tension between respecting the rights of a human being

55:53.680 --> 56:00.080
and saying, like, you need to step up, maybe sort of deposit the carrot, like you really like to

56:00.080 --> 56:06.400
really encourage fellow workers know when there's a person that's not pulling their side of the

56:07.280 --> 56:13.440
doing as great of a job as they could be? But isn't the person that's not doing a great of a job

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
going to start to manipulate the system that slows the firing in their self-interest?

56:18.800 --> 56:23.200
Well, I think there would be certain, so maybe another way to put it is think about like if

56:23.200 --> 56:27.440
you're a partner in a law firm, right? I don't really know how law firms work, so I probably

56:27.440 --> 56:32.000
shouldn't use this analogy, but correct me if I'm wrong, but let's say you're a partner, you kind

56:32.000 --> 56:37.120
of have equity in your law firm or something beyond your billable hours, and let's say you're

56:38.240 --> 56:41.840
going to be fired from your law firm or they're laying off people or whatever else.

56:41.840 --> 56:46.400
They could just get rid of you, but they would also have to figure out how to kind of buy you out,

56:46.400 --> 56:54.160
too, after a certain point. So I think that like in a cooperative firm, you probably have a system

56:54.160 --> 56:59.600
where you, after a certain point of working productively, you probably have a period where

56:59.680 --> 57:06.080
you get fired really quickly, no matter what, but once your job security kicks in, you would

57:06.080 --> 57:13.840
be able to, it would be a process. It would probably be like a day or two process to figure

57:13.840 --> 57:18.880
it out, or maybe they would have a progressive discipline process, which is first you have to get

57:18.880 --> 57:24.960
a verbal feedback, then maybe a written performance review, then you could be fired. I mean, that's

57:24.960 --> 57:29.600
how it works in a lot of workplaces with either unions or with just basic job security.

57:31.040 --> 57:34.880
Most countries, that's how it works because there's not at-will employment in most countries.

57:34.880 --> 57:43.760
So I think that the real tension is if you fire someone, if you're condemning them to destitution,

57:43.760 --> 57:48.400
then morally, you would really feel something there, as you should as a human being concerned

57:48.400 --> 57:54.080
about other people. But in a social system or even basic social democratic system,

57:54.560 --> 57:59.600
there would be mechanisms to take care of that person. So one, if a firm is failing for any

57:59.600 --> 58:08.000
reason, they're getting outcompete or whatever else, those workers would then lend in the hands,

58:08.000 --> 58:12.960
just for a little bit, of the state, right? And there could be active labor market policies to

58:12.960 --> 58:17.280
retrain people to go into expanding sectors, or your sector is now obsolete, but here you have

58:17.280 --> 58:22.480
these skills, you're going to be trained and here are some resources to kind of help you along your

58:22.480 --> 58:27.040
training and then there's a bunch of firms hiring, so go on your way. And then also just with an

58:27.040 --> 58:32.480
expanded welfare state, being destitute in certain countries, being unemployed in certain countries,

58:32.480 --> 58:41.600
is easier than in other countries or situations. So you still can fall back on that mechanism.

58:41.600 --> 58:49.200
And also my vision of a market socialism, a democratic socialism, there would be an

58:49.200 --> 58:54.560
expanded state sector. Not anything you can imagine, but the way in which there's more of

58:54.560 --> 58:59.280
a state sector in countries like Norway or Denmark than there is in the US. So there would be

59:00.080 --> 59:07.600
various forms of state employment and whatever else. So I think that the real question is,

59:08.160 --> 59:14.000
should being bad at your job or getting fired for any reason or getting laid off, should that be a

59:14.000 --> 59:19.680
cause to have you totally lose your shirt? Or maybe should you just have the rebound,

59:19.680 --> 59:24.400
maybe you have less money for consumption or whatever else and you'll be on your way

59:24.400 --> 59:31.200
onto bigger and better things in a few months. So a strong social net in many ways make it

59:32.000 --> 59:37.040
more efficient to fire people who are not good at their job because then they won't be,

59:38.560 --> 59:42.160
that won't actually significantly damage their quality of life and they have a chance to find

59:42.160 --> 59:52.560
a job at which they can flourish. To step out into the macro, there's a tension here as well.

59:52.560 --> 59:57.440
So you said that there's inequality between the classes, the capitalist class and the working

59:57.440 --> 01:00:02.240
class. There's a lot of ways you can maybe correct me on the numbers, but you could say

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:07.120
that the top 1% of Americans have more wealth than the bottom 50%. That's not talking about

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.120
perhaps capitalist class and the working class, but it's a good sort of estimate, right?

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:21.200
The flip side of that, if you just look at countries that have more economic freedom

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:29.200
versus less economic freedom, more capitalism versus less capitalism, their GDP seems to be

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:37.120
significantly higher. And so at the local level, you might say that there's an inequality,

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.800
but if you look historically over decades, it seems like the more capitalism there is,

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.920
the higher the GDP grows and therefore the level of the quality of life and the basic income,

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.920
basic wealth, the average, even including the working class goes up over time. Can you see

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.280
both sides of this? I could definitely accept some of that premise. One, within capitalism,

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:10.960
you want a bigger pie. Then if you divide up that pie, even if the bottom 10% or the working class

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:20.640
share is less as a percentage, it's still more in raw terms. So it's better for everyone.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:27.520
The part that I would dispute is more economic freedom versus less economic freedom. There's

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:34.960
obviously some countries in which capitalism doesn't work and maybe economic freedom plays a

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:41.760
role. If you're in a country like Egypt or India with a highly or previously highly bureaucratic

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.680
system, so you need to get licenses to do anything and you need to run things for the state or you

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.240
need to bribe someone to get an incorporation done or whatever else, that's in case in which

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:57.280
I would accept the premise of, okay, economic freedom to take entrepreneurial risk to start

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:05.200
something new is limited. There's all sorts of factors in which it's too difficult to

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.200
start a firm and it benefits no one really except for whatever bureaucracy might be

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:21.120
might be taking their 15% cut. But in general, I think in advanced economies,

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:27.760
it doesn't really work that way. So think about it this way. If you pretend like we're back,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:32.560
I'm sorry to go to Scandinavia again, but this is a good example.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.160
Let's say you're back in the 1970s in Scandinavia or whatever else. You're in a country with

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:47.680
extremely powerful unions. So the unions have a lot of labor rights, the state has certain

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:52.480
high taxation and certain guarantees on you too, but you're a capitalist there.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:03.120
Now, what would you do if your capitalist competitors in the US were able to pay workers

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:12.000
$10 an hour and you have to pay them $20? You would probably, and assuming you can't

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.520
just flee or shut down or whatever else, you'd probably find ways to use labor-saving technology.

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:26.320
That power of the high wages might encourage you to invest more in technology and to utilize

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.720
people's time is better so they're more productive at work, so they're not just sitting around or

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:37.120
whatever else. So this really happened in practice in the Scandinavian countries,

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:44.080
in part because it was combined with a certain type of pattern wage bargaining.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:53.280
So I'll explain this really simply, but let's pretend that you're in a sector with three

01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:01.440
different companies, let's say an automotive sector, and I'll just say one is GM, one is Ford,

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:10.080
one is Chrysler. Now, all these workers in your sector are all unionized, they're all

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:17.680
Swedish UAW, whatever the equivalent is, members, and they're all paid the same,

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.920
and the union is setting through bargaining, the union is setting the wages across the sector.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:28.320
But the unions, and let's say GM is the most productive of these companies, Ford is number

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:36.640
two, Chrysler is number three. The unions would intentionally set the wages, set their benchmark

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:42.960
to Ford in the middle. So what that would do is say to Ford, okay, Ford will stay in business

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:49.520
because they'll be able to meet the wage demands. Chrysler might go out of business because they

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.880
won't be able to meet the demands, or they'll have to really adapt really quickly, they might

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.480
have to lay off people, they might have to restructure. So the union knows this in advance,

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:04.720
and all the auto workers know this. But the most efficient manufacturer, GM, now has excess profits

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:09.840
because if they were negotiating with just the GM workers, the GM workers might even have been able

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.160
to demand more, but instead these workers are pegging their wage demands to Ford's level,

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:22.240
and GM is in theory able to expand and employ more people and adopt new production

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.960
techniques with their surplus. Then those Chrysler workers would be absorbed by the state,

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:36.160
by active labor market policies, then put back to work for GM or for these expanding sectors.

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.360
So in other words, you're now in a situation where the state has a pretty big role in your economy,

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:49.920
taking a lot of your money and taxes. Unions are really shaping your life as a capitalist far more

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.760
than would happen in a country like the United States, and yet still, despite your more limited

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:02.960
economic freedom, you're still creating a more productive economy. So it could work. The system

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.640
has to be designed right, and I think social democracies were designed the right way. I think

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:11.200
any future democratic socialism after social democracy would have to be designed the right way.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:18.720
Could you just link on that a little more, the pattern wage bargaining? So GM is the most efficient,

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:26.560
and Ford is the second most. Can you explain to me again the wages,

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:33.680
sending the wages to the Ford level, how that is good for GM? How that encourages more GM?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:43.840
This is just sectoral, or actually in this case, centralized wage bargaining. So setting the wages

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:49.680
at a level that Ford can afford, but a level that would probably be too expensive for Chrysler and

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:58.720
the automotive sector, would benefit GM because they're drawing what we could call excess profits.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:09.200
Because if the GM itself could potentially have to deal with just the enterprise of GM workers

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.360
bargaining for wages, and if they saw their profitability was high, they would know their

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.720
leverage, and they would say, pay us even more, or else we're going to go on strike. But instead,

01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:25.600
they're accepting slightly lower wages than they would have otherwise had in return for the company

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:31.920
having excess profits, that they're, through both the state, their union, and sometimes there's

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.120
worker councils or whatever else, they're playing a role in saying, okay, we're going to make sure

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:45.920
this excess profit is actually invested productively in order to expand employment and just output.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:53.200
Okay, can we talk about unions? In general, then, what are the pros and cons of unions?

01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:01.120
So the interest of the union, maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong. I have a lot to learn

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:09.680
both about the economics and the human experience of a union. The union's interest is to what? To

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:18.480
protect worker rights and to maximize worker happiness, not the success and the productivity

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:24.320
and the efficiency of a company, right? No, I would disagree. So I think a union's

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:31.440
interest is in what's collectively bargaining on behalf of workers, because in certain cases,

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:43.120
I am right now a manager at The Nation magazine. If I have a problem with my working conditions,

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.320
or I need a raise or whatever else, I could, with my skill set, my background, my role in the

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.840
company, I could go to my boss, the owner of The Nation, and say, okay, I need to renegotiate my

01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:02.800
contract on these terms. I could bargain, right? Now, if I was an ordinary worker at a CVS or

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.680
something, if I didn't like my conditions and I went to my boss and said, hey, I need a $2 raise

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:17.280
and I need to be home by 830 because I have obligations at home, the boss would probably

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:23.280
say, I'm sorry, that's not possible. Maybe try the Rite Aid down the street or the Walgreens down

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:32.800
the street or whatever. Now, if I went to the boss at a place like CVS, or even better, if all the

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:41.280
pharmaceutical workers at Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens, went to our bosses and said, listen,

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:52.000
we collectively need $2 more and better hours, shorter shifts, or whatever else,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.040
then they would probably have no choice but to concede. You have to bargain collectively at any

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:05.040
level if you're an ordinary worker. There are some exceptions, but that's for certain highly

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.400
skilled workers, but even in those cases, of course, all workers are skilled. I mean,

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.320
just the technical definition. Even in those cases, a lot of those workers have to bargain

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:25.120
collectively as well in order to get more wealth, but they cannot make their demands so excessive

01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:31.280
that their firm gets out of business. The workers only are workers as long as they're

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:39.840
gainfully employed. Often unions will try to select their wage demands at such a level

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:43.040
that it ensures that their firm will stay in business.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:47.920
Yeah, but the problem is the way firms go out of business isn't by explosion,

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:58.560
like the way popcorn starts getting cooked. At a certain moment, it just is over. It seems like

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:04.560
the union can, through collective bargaining, keep increasing the wage, keep increasing the interest

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.480
of the worker until it suffocates the company that it doesn't die immediately, but it dies

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.520
in like five years. That might still serve the interest of the worker,

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:20.480
but it doesn't serve the interest of society as a whole that's creating cool stuff.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.960
A market that's operating and increasing cool stuff and constantly innovating and so on,

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.640
and creating more and more cool stuff and increasing the quality of life in general.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.680
I disagree with the premise because I think even taking your example, that would be better for

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:43.840
society. If a firm cannot pay its workers a living wage, but its competitors can, then that firm

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:50.320
will either figure out a way to innovate, develop new techniques, new markets, new ways to be

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:56.240
productive, or it should go out of business. It would be better for it to go out of business

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:01.200
than to stay in business or to be artificially kept in business in any sort of way.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.360
That's the Chrysler, my old centralized bargaining.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.600
But then there is innovation costs money too. The flip side of that,

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:20.480
I think to play devil's advocate, is that it incentivizes automotive industry is probably

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:27.920
a good example of that. It incentivizes cutting costs everywhere and whatever has been making

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:34.160
you money currently, figuring out how to do that really well without investing into the long-term

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.280
future of the company for all the different ways it can pivot, all the different interesting

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.360
things it could do in terms of investing into R&D. Whenever there's more and more and more

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:52.880
pressure on paying a living wage for the workers, it might suffocate and die over the next 5, 10,

01:12:52.880 --> 01:13:00.640
20 years, which might be a good destructive force from a capitalist perspective,

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:07.200
but it might rob us of the Einstein of the flourishing that the company and the workers

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:13.040
within it can do over a period of 5, 10, 20 years. This is just a problem with a lot of

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.640
capitalism, which is about short-termism. The same thing could be said from you're starting

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.920
a company, you have a plan for it to make a lot of money, but your investors want dividends right

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:33.840
away. You have to take away from your long-term R&D or other plans and deliver short-term dividends.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:40.480
That's often why a lot of, I think, R&D is often rooted in state institutions and research and

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.880
whatever else is being drawn on. Also, I think that that's a reason why the state has some sort

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.880
of role in fostering firms in either my version of a socialist economy or a capitalist economy

01:13:52.880 --> 01:14:00.800
or whatever else to help with these time horizon problems. I won't dispute that workers could play

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.000
a role or wage demands could play a role in time horizon problems, but more often than that,

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.400
it's coming from investors, it's coming from just a host of other market pressures that people might

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:20.800
have. I would say that in the real world, a lot of investment funds don't come from just retained

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.560
earnings. It comes from a lot of sources. I think this is a problem that could be solved

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:31.360
through public policy, but definitely exists today as well. You mentioned living wage.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.560
Is there a tension between a living wage, and maybe you could speak to what a living wage means,

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.000
and the workers owning all of the profit of the company?

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:54.720
Sort of this kind of spectrum. No, I guess the spectrum is from no minimum wage, the lowest

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.200
possible thing you could pay to a worker, then somewhere in that spectrum is a living wage,

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.120
and then at the top is all of the profit from the company is owned by the workers.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:12.880
So split to the workers. I think that any society is going to have to make distributional

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:20.880
choices. You could imagine a variety of capitalism in which workers are paid quite little,

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.080
but there's extremely high taxation, and there's redistribution after the fact. You could imagine

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.320
a system in which there is less taxation after the fact, but there's more guarantees and

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:37.440
regulations on how much people are paid before the fact. In my vision of a social society,

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.880
there would be some other way that unions work. In my example, the centralized bargaining unions

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:50.800
would work that bargain at the sectoral level and not just at the enterprise level like our unions

01:15:51.520 --> 01:16:00.080
do today. There could be benchmarks set for different occupations or wages, and the reason

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.000
why you would want a benchmark at a worker-controlled firm is that you don't want workers self-exploiting

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.680
themselves in order to gobble up market share because you don't want them collectively deciding,

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:16.160
okay, we're going to invest in this longer-term time horizon and out-compete other people that

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.840
way. So you might say, okay, if you do this sort of clerical work, you have to be paid

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:30.800
the equivalent of $15 an hour. That's a minimum, but on top of that, you get dividends from excess

01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:38.400
profits. I think it would also have to be combined with public financing for expansions

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:43.920
and for development, which could be done in quite a competitive way. You could have a variety of

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:53.360
banks. In my vision, state-owned banks, but how would they decide who to invest in and who

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.560
to not invest in, who to give a loan for expansion to and who not to? Because you don't want it to be

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.920
like, oh, I'm going to invest in my nephew's firm and not this other firm, or I'm going to invest

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:08.640
in this guy's firm because he's an Italian, but not this guy's firm because he's Albanian,

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:15.520
or whatever else. Just make it rational at the level of their goal is just like any other

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:24.080
investment person at a bank today to maintain a certain risk profile and to have an interest

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:30.800
yield and decide to invest on that basis. There's a huge automotive firm that has been on business

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:37.520
for 50 years that needs a little operating cash. Yeah, they could get their $50 million or 3% loan.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.320
If you have some crazy blue sky idea and you manage to get it to that point, maybe you and

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.360
your friends would get it at 12% or something close to what a VC would offer today. I only go

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:57.920
into these details to say that a system doesn't have to in advance map out all the different

01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:04.800
possibilities, but I think it does have to be willing to accept a lot of things that we know

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:09.680
today. I can't give you a version of socialism that everything's going to be fine, we're going

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:16.480
to live harmoniously, and we won't have these sort of tensions. You could hunt in the evening and

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:24.320
fish in the afternoon and write criticism, whatever else. I do hope that there's horizons

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:31.280
beyond this that we could aspire to. I do have those visions, but for now, I think our task

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:39.280
as socialists is to imagine five minutes after midnight, what can we do right away within our

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:47.520
lifetime vision? That means through some level of central planning, reallocating resources to the

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:55.680
workers. I think the primary mechanism in this private sector under socialism would be a market

01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:02.400
mechanism, firms competing against each other to expand, connected to a system of public financing.

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:09.440
Even at that level, the individual bankers and public banks and so on would be operating based

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:18.160
on their own rationality. The state would strictly shape investment decisions, but maybe no more than

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.840
they do in a lot of capitalist systems. The state might already today in a lot of countries decide

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.400
we want to invest in green technology, so it's going to be favorable rates for people or tax

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.240
credits for people investing in green technology. The state already shapes investment.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:39.920
I think what should be centrally planned, and this is where I'm proud to sound like an old school

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:48.880
socialist, is things like healthcare, things like transit, things like our natural monopolies of

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:56.320
lots of types can be done very well through planning. We already have plenty of examples,

01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:04.320
but a lot of this society I think would be the private sphere of worker-controlled cooperatives

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:09.280
competing against each other, weak firms failing, successful firms expanded.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.080
And the banks, you're saying publicly or privately owned?

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:12.960
Publicly owned.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.720
Let's just put it all on the table that it's almost guaranteed that every system has corruption.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.480
I guess the bigger question is which system has more corruption?

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:31.120
This one was central planning and worker cooperatives versus unfettered capitalism

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:33.200
or any flavor of capitalism.

01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:40.160
I think any system has potential for corruption. I think it depends on how good your civil service

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:44.640
is, how much oversight do you have to resolve a problem once it arises?

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.680
How does corruption happen in a socialist system? So you have to, again, I apologize,

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:55.520
but the large scale examples of it. So we can look at Soviet Union, China, and Sweden,

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:04.000
fundamentally different nations and histories and peoples and economic systems and political systems,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:14.240
but all could be called in part socialist. And so there's a ridiculous almost caricature

01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.320
of corruption in the Soviet system, the gigantic bureaucracy that's built.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:28.000
Where somehow corruption seeps in through kind of this version of responsibility

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.200
that nobody's really responsible for the corruption.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.440
I just had a conversation with Ed Calderon who fought the cartels in Mexico,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.840
and there is a huge amount of corruption in Mexico, but it's not like even seen as

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:46.240
corruption. You understand when the cop pulls you over, you give this much money and so on.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.880
And so that kind of seems to happen in certain systems, and it seems to have happened in social

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:57.440
systems more than in capitalist systems in the 20th century. Or maybe I'm wrong on that.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:22:01.040
No, I mean, I think in a lot of countries it's seen as the cost of doing business.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:08.400
Now, in particular countries built on a system of central planning or just state allocation

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:14.480
resources where the state both produces and allocates and things run through bureaucracies,

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:21.680
then I think you're much more apt to have corruption than in a system with just a smaller

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:28.080
sphere for the state. So for example, if you're in a hypothetical version of the U.S., you might see

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:32.880
a lot more corruption in the post office, but you wouldn't have that corruption in your workplace,

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:41.120
so you kind of learn to go around that. For one thing, even in state sectors, you can have,

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:47.280
and this often is the case in democratic countries, you have a transparent civil service

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:54.160
where people who are corrupt are prosecuted by judges, where it's frowned upon, and it just,

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.160
over time, it goes away. So you go from having political machines that were tied to certain,

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.680
you know, had friends in certain precincts and whatever else in the U.S. in the 19th century and

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:10.400
an early 20th century to now today, that would be a huge scandal and unheard of, right? So I think

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:20.480
over time, having an independent court system, having a truly meritocratic civil service can be

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:26.640
implemented anywhere. I think, though, in the Soviet Union, the extra little bit that happened

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:32.880
was you had a bureaucracy that just had so much power because the bureaucracy was producing and

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.360
distributing everything, and everyone was relying on the bureaucracy with jobs. The way to social

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.360
advancement was through the bureaucracies, so you end up with people like Khrushchev,

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:49.120
people going from peasants to supreme leaders of countries just through getting hooked up in the

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:55.200
bureaucracy and advancing within it. Not all these were bad people. I don't think Khrushchev was that

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.240
bad of a person or Gorbachev, but this is their mechanism to advancement in systems like this.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:07.760
In the vision of democratic socialism that I propose, the state doesn't have that overriding

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:13.760
power to begin with, but I think in either case, corruption has arose in many different systems and

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.320
has been successfully dealt with. I think on the developmental trajectory of even countries today

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:29.040
that we think of as being very corrupt, corruption will fade away as well, but you definitely need

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:40.640
a system in which individuals are incentivized to act rationally. If you're in a system

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:47.120
in which cops who are corrupt are prosecuted and investigated, and there's internal controls,

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:54.080
a civilian board review, and internal investigators within police departments or whatever else,

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:59.920
there will be less corruption over time if people are punished. If you're in a system in which

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.600
if you're running a firm or you're the manager of a firm, an elected manager, and everyone at that

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:10.800
firm is trying for more efficiency and trying for more excess profits or whatever else at the end

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:15.360
of the day, dividends at the end of the day, then if you try to hire your nephew and he's not good

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:22.640
at your job, you're not going to win reelection. I think no system should rely on a change in

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.320
culture that come naturally or some sort of individual altruism. I think the systems have

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:35.120
to be constructed in such a way that it's not rational to behave poorly. From a theoretical

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:44.240
perspective, either a socialist or capitalist system can have either culture, but it seems like

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:52.960
if you prioritize meritocracy, if the people that are good, whatever the good means,

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:59.360
in terms of integrity, in terms of performance, in terms of competence, it seems like that leads

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.400
to a less corrupt system, and it seems like capitalism, there's all kinds of flavors of

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:11.520
capitalism, but capitalism, because it does prioritize meritocracy, more often leads to less

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:17.440
corruption. That's not a question of political or economic systems, it's a question of what kind

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.480
of stuff do you talk about that leads to a culture of less corruption? First of all, I think in

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:30.320
theory, maybe capitals and birds, meritocracy, but I think in practice, anyone watching this,

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.040
or you and me, we think of some of the people we know that work the hardest, and they're often

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:41.360
working class people, work in the food service industry or whatever else, right? I think we

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.480
don't have, in practice, I don't think we actually live in a society that rewards

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:54.000
people for hard work. I think we reward people for a combination of accidents of birth plus hard work.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.480
Let me push back, because yes, I agree with you, but let me push back on a subtle point,

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:09.040
because I like to draw a difference between hard work and meritocracy. As a person who works

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:14.720
really hard, I work crazy hard, but I've also worked with a lot of people that are just much

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:22.800
better than me. Hard work does not equal skill, good, productive. I just want to draw that

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:31.840
distinction, but I agree with you, I don't think our society rewards directly hard work or even

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:35.840
high skill. There's many examples at least we can see that it does not do so.

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.040
We have an unequal distribution of talent, of course. If we lived in a society in which

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:47.520
there was some level of acceptable inequality, and it's a normative question of how much we

01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:54.800
would say is acceptable, and that inequality was based on this unequal distribution of talent,

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.160
then I think that would be fine with me. That would actually be a meritocracy.

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:07.040
What I see in the US is often, if you are a upper middle class or a rich kid and you

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:15.280
get a good education, K through 12, out of those people, there will be some that work extra hard

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:19.280
and go on to do incredible things or are very successful, and there will be other people that

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:28.080
do not and decide for whatever reason or go down a different path. You could say maybe among that

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:33.120
group of the upper middle class, there is a meritocracy, but they're actually given those

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.560
opportunities to make their own decisions and to fail, whereas many, many other people, the vast

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:43.680
majority of American society, I would say, 60 plus percent, don't really get those opportunities to

01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:50.240
make those choices to begin with. I would aspire to the type of world at least as a first step

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:59.520
in which our only inequalities are based on our unequal, innate distributions of talent.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:07.600
I guess a lot of people worry that when you have a socialist in any degree central planning or

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:12.880
perhaps a collective of workers, that it won't result in that kind of meritocracy that you're

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.360
talking about, but you're saying that no, it's possible to have that kind of meritocracy.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:23.280
Think about it this way. The workers themselves are incentivized and are shaped by market forces

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:28.400
too. They're trying to respond to consumer needs and preferences. They're trying to expand market

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:33.120
share. They're trying to make money. It requires no leap into these people are going to be more

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.080
altruistic or whatever else. Even on purely bourgeois terms, the same way you would maybe

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.360
justify competitive capitalist firms, I think you could justify this system as long as you think

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:49.840
that people elected management can perform just as well. I think based on the experiences of

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:56.480
cooperatives, we've seen that they can. Then at the state level, state bureaucracies have their

01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:04.080
own sets of incentives, but in most systems that already have extensive state bureaucracies,

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:09.680
these people at high levels are appointed or elected. They're held to certain standards.

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:16.960
At the national level, a national government wants to maintain the tax revenue that they need to pay

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:23.200
for services. We already, I think, have incentive structures that you could say that some people

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:29.040
might disagree with the normative thing of why would people have to own their own means of

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.240
production, control their workplaces or whatever else? Why do we need this level of equality?

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:40.480
Can't we just get by with our existing system, but just make things a little bit easier for

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.000
capitalists to make money than everyone will benefit or whatever else? That's a normative

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:49.600
question. In my vision of socialism, there'll be plenty of multiple parties with different views

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:55.360
and perspectives trying to either push us deeper into more radical forms of socialism or on the

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:03.040
other hand, to roll back to more capitalist forms of government. I think that, again, you can't try

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:11.600
to make up a perfect system and try to implement it. You have to do it as a process democratically

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.800
and so on. Just philosophically, in your gut,

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:22.960
you're more concerned about the innate equal value of human beings versus the efficiency

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.440
of this wonderful mechanism that we call human civilization at producing cool stuff.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:34.640
Just like a gut, if we're sitting at a bar, that's where the gut feeling you come with. Of course,

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.960
your mind is open, but you want to protect the equal value of humans.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.760
I don't want to fight the hypothetical, so I'll say equality. I am concerned with equality,

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:49.040
but I don't think the two are necessarily always in tension.

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:55.600
But also, when you think about all the great things that human beings have produced,

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:04.800
often, I think people today just look at the end outcome. We go to the pyramids and we'll marvel

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.840
at the pyramids and the human achievement that it took to make it happen, but we won't

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.880
stop to think about all the suffering that went into the making of that thing.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:19.760
I think we kind of lean in the opposite direction where we marvel at our achievements,

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:24.960
but we don't often think about the suffering or exploitation that went into certain human

01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:32.320
achievements. I would love a society in which we could marvel at things and not have to worry

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.480
about the exploitation that was involved because there was no exploitation or oppression involved.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:40.480
There was just human ingenuity and creativity and collaboration.

01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:45.760
And to a degree, which you may disagree, to the degree there's a tension between the two,

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.800
at least give equal weight to the consideration of the suffering

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.480
and don't just marvel at the beauty of the creations. To the degree there is a tension

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:58.160
between the two. What Stalin did, actually, too, it's not just capitalist, but what Stalin did was

01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:03.280
he sacrificed whole generations because he thought that he was building something for the future,

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:09.440
for future Russians to enjoy and for future people of the world to enjoy. And actually,

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:15.760
that analogy that I just gave about the pyramids was written by Karl Kotzky, the German

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.560
socialist, anti-Stalinist critic, when he was complaining about US journalists and others

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.640
going to Russia in the 1930s and marveling at all the new industries.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.280
Are these people blind to the suffering behind these things they're marveling about?

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.680
Speaking of which, I think you mentioned in the context of

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:39.840
a social democracy that freedom of speech and freedom of the press,

01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.560
or basically the freedom of people to have a voice is an important component,

01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:48.720
which I think is something that caught my ear a little bit. Because if you think about

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:55.680
the Soviet Union, one of the ways that the authoritarian regime was able to control,

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:00.560
it's almost part of the central planning is you have to control the message and you have to limit

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:07.520
the freedom of the press. So there's a kind of notion, especially in ideas, or maybe

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.960
caricatures of the ideas of cultural Marxism, sometimes caricatured even further as wokeism,

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.560
that you want to be careful with speech. You want to censor speech because some speech

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:25.120
hurts people. So in some sense, you want to respect the value, the equality of human beings

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.400
by being careful with the words you say. Is there a tension there for you?

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:37.360
I think there's no tension. And in part, I think that it is very condescending or patronizing

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:45.760
to assume that people can't take debate, that people can't either as a society or individuals

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:56.320
visually be engaged in the exchange of ideas or even very vigorous debate without being broken

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:02.560
by it. It's just not the case. I'm basically a free speech absolutist. I would draw the line at

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:09.120
direct incitements of violence or certain other speech like that, but in general.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.360
Do you think a lot of people would be surprised to hear that?

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.160
No, I mean, not people who know my work. I mean, more generally, I think a lot of people on the

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:23.040
right, even in the center, I think might have the idea that a lot of the far left wants to censor

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:28.400
them. I think some of the center left wants to censor them. But I think a lot on the far left,

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:37.520
on the Marxist or socialist left, I think that free speech is more or less the norm.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:46.800
Yeah. Where is the imperative, the censor coming from? Is this just some small subset of the left

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:52.960
on Twitter? Is there some philosophical idea behind certain groups that like if we're to

01:35:52.960 --> 01:36:00.800
steal man the case and which group actually has the interest of humanity in mind in wanting to

01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.480
censor speech? I think we might need to just take it case by case for an example by example,

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:12.400
because honestly, I would have to think about a particular case. But let's just say generally

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:22.560
that a lot of American liberalism rightly sees the revolution around the civil rights and later

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:30.400
the extension of this rights revolution for gay rights and so on as being a very positive

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:37.200
achievement of the last half century and I completely agree. Now for me, now that we've

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:43.680
won those rights, a lot of our battle for change needs to go beyond the representational realm

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:50.960
and needs to really reground itself in the material bread and butter struggles of ordinary

01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:57.360
people trying to survive, the battle for good healthcare for all Americans and so on. These

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:02.160
are my immediate demands. I think there's a segment of American liberalism that doesn't

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:07.680
want to go in that confrontational economic direction and wants to steer it away from

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.840
battles over things like universal healthcare and so on and really are just still caught at

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:21.120
this battle over rights and representation and it's devolved in such a way that they feel like

01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.560
they need to make change. The way they make change is only through interventions and culture

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.680
because they don't really have the same sense of class and class struggle that agree or disagree

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:38.480
with it. It's a very material plane. So instead, they look at comedians who said the wrong thing

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:45.120
or they look at all sorts of other ways to make change. It's not really making a change. It's

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:52.880
just making them look bad and making our culture worse and I think that's where a lot of it comes

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:59.600
from but I think that a lot of the left, even the left that's much more into battles over

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.720
race and lots of other stuff like real serious anti-racist on the left. Of course, I'm an anti-racist

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:12.880
but a lot of my work is focused on the primacy of class but even these people are very concerned

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:19.360
about material struggles and issues and they don't really care about these issues they think are

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:26.480
ephemeral kind of issues. So when you focus exclusively on language, that somehow leads

01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:35.840
you astray like on being concerned about language without deeper economic inequalities and so on.

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:39.360
You just become an asshole that's on Twitter pointing out how everything,

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:46.720
how racist everyone is. So the anti-racism becomes a caricature of anti-racism. Exactly,

01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:53.120
anti-racism was really about the struggle of people for equal rights and voting. It was about

01:38:53.120 --> 01:39:00.400
the struggle for people who were trapped into bad neighborhoods because they couldn't get decent

01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:04.080
jobs and their neighborhoods were redlined or whatever else. It was really like a struggle

01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:11.120
for survival and what was the main demands, the language of this one? It was the march for jobs

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:17.600
and freedom. It was the slogan, I am a man, asserting the universal dignity of people.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.320
This is what the civil rights movement was about and it wasn't surprised there was a lot of

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:29.600
self-described socialists, people like Bayard Rustin, A. Philip Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr.

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:38.800
These were people who were, Ella Baker, they were socialists and I think a lot of Americans

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.640
agree with them with their immediate demands even though they weren't themselves a socialist,

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:50.320
but it was a very materialistic struggle and I think a lot of this has been co-opted into

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:59.040
just some sort of vague and just disconcerting complaints about language or culture and so on.

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.760
Martin Luther King was a socialist. To what degree was he a socialist? I would love to

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:08.240
learn about that. Martin Luther King, I think, broadly called himself at various points in his

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:16.960
life a Christian socialist or a democratic socialist, especially after his speech against

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:23.120
the Vietnam War in the Riverside Church, I think it was 67. The last years of his life, he became

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:30.000
much more involved in struggles against the war and also struggles for workers' rights. He was

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.280
assassinated when he was at a rally at workers' rights, so he thought the next battle was going

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:41.520
to be an economic battle. He had this famous line where he said, I don't just want to integrate

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:47.040
the lunch counter if it means that we can't afford to order a burger while we're there.

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:50.240
That was the line along those lines and I think that got to his point where the civil rights

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:56.080
struggle was part of a step of building some sort of wider movement. He and these other civil

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:00.480
rights leaders were very much interested in working with organized labor, working with

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.240
the left as it was constructed then and building some sort of mass space for

01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:12.320
not just rights but redistribution. It's fascinating. It's fascinating which figures

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:18.400
self-identified and were in part socialists. Albert Einstein was one. Albert Einstein

01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:25.200
wrote an article for the first issue of this left-wing magazine, it's actually still publishing

01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:32.000
today called Monthly Review and I think 1949. His article is called Why Socialism? I don't think

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:36.160
it's paywalled, so people should check it out. But yeah, Einstein was one.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:45.120
Probably the central idea is the pacifist, the anti-war idea for him or no?

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:53.360
Honestly, it's been so many years since I read it. I think it was more economically focused,

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:59.920
but I would need to go back and read it. But is war in general a part of the fundamental

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:05.760
ideas that democratic socialists are against? What's the relation between socialism and war?

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:09.920
I think that traditionally in the socialist movement, war was associated with

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:16.400
capitalist competition and international competition. You can look at World War I

01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.760
as very much a case where different nations were competing with each other and developing quite

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:27.840
violent rivalries that was in part based on competition and the periphery over access to

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:33.040
markets and colonies and whatever else. It was very easy to draw a direct correlation.

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:44.080
I am opposed to war. I'm opposed to imperialism, the domination of strong nations dominating

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.320
smaller nations. I wouldn't call myself a pacifist. I think most socialists wouldn't call

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:54.240
themselves pacifists because there are some struggles that are worth fighting for. There's

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.840
national liberation struggles and so on where if there's no democratic avenue for change,

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.200
positive change has been made through armed revolts around colonialism and whatnot.

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:09.920
We're living in an age where hopefully, I know neither of us have children,

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:17.040
our children or children's children in the future won't have to live through war. That is one thing

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:23.680
that as countries have gotten more developed, as the world has changed, we've actually seen

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:31.520
less and less war. I won't dispute Pinker on this. I think it's true. Obviously, Putin's invasion of

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:38.400
Ukraine and the conflict in Ethiopia is an exception, but on the whole, I think we're

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:46.000
going in that direction. I think it's always been a major organizing plank of socialists

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:53.280
against war and against this sense of right-wing nationalism and national identity that often leads

01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.640
to war. Obviously, not everyone on the right has embraced that. A lot of libertarians are consistently

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:05.440
anti-war as well, but I think the right ideologically has been associated with war,

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:11.280
even if some advocates of capitalism have not been. Then there's the military industrial complex,

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:19.280
which is the financial machine of the whole thing, I presume. Well, since a lot of that is

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:24.320
government, what's the relation to socialism and the military industrial complex?

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:29.520
Well, a lot of it's government contracts, but it's privately produced by companies like Lockheed

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:35.760
Martin and things like that. You could draw a very crude materialist connection between any

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:41.680
of these things to prove an ideological point, but we could produce just as many arms and then

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:48.000
just bury them or never fire them off or whatever else. Obviously, there are companies that have a

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.200
vested interest in heightening up tensions or saying that we need to buy a new weapon system

01:44:55.200 --> 01:45:00.560
to be prepared for a conventional war with China, Russia. Meanwhile, I think we all know that if

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:06.640
there's going to be a conventional war between these countries, it's going to lead to something

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:16.160
worse. No amount of advanced fighter jets is going to make a difference, but I try to avoid

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:24.080
cruder, causal connections, even though there are relationships. It's like the old slogan,

01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:30.160
which was quite an effective slogan in the early 2000s at my first anti-war marches when I was a

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:36.560
teenager. I definitely have shouted it, but no war for oil. Both is correct in that it gets to

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:42.960
what people's senses of what's going on and how it's bad, but also analytically, it's wanting

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:49.040
to explain what really happened or why we ended up in the Middle East, which is a much more complex

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:55.840
geopolitical story. Yeah, and it is a story of geopolitics. It's perhaps less a story of

01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:05.520
capitalism or socialism. It's a geopolitical story that I think actually operates outside

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:12.160
of the economic system of the individual nations. It has to do more with, honestly, in part, egos

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:21.040
of leaders. There's an international battle for resources, but surely there's alternatives.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:28.880
Yeah, definitely. I think that part of what being a socialist is about dreaming in the long term

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:34.400
about a different sort of world without, in my mind, needless divisions of people into nations

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:39.920
with standing armies. I'm sure we'll still have pride about where we're from and there'll still

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:46.320
be distinctive cultural features and so on about where we're from. We definitely would, at least

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.120
for the foreseeable future, be divided into places as administrative units, but the idea that there

01:46:53.120 --> 01:47:00.480
should be a Mexican army and an American army and a Russian army and a Ukrainian army is just on the

01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.520
face of it, I think, in the long run will be seen as ridiculous, just like we see it as ridiculous

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:15.840
today looking back at the idea that a lord from London would be engaged in civil strife with a

01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:22.880
lord from Liverpool and a bunch of peasants would die. On the face of it just seems ridiculous that

01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:27.920
these different places would have their own banners and lords and armies. I think in the long run,

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:32.480
you might have to zoom out a thousand years, but in the long run, people will say the same about

01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:41.840
nation states and standing armies and battles over specks of dirt that mean nothing in a cosmic sense.

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:49.920
Yeah, no, for sure aliens would laugh at us or humans that go far beyond Earth and look at the history.

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:58.400
Well, most of the history will be forgotten because if humans successfully expand out into

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:05.520
the universe, just the scale of civilization will grow so fast that the bickering of the first few

01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:11.520
thousand years of human history will be seeming significant. There's a very Marxist idea that I

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:17.040
both appreciate in one way, but on the other hand, it's kind of scary, which is that human

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:22.720
history is only now beginning before we're in prehistory, but in the future will be in

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:29.040
kind of real history. I think that a lot of really important history has already happened

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:35.920
and I think posterity will remember it. I think that it will be easier to assign

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:44.800
certain people the role of like villains, the people not to engage in the contentious topic,

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:50.640
off topic of Ukraine or whatever else, but the idea that one government or man would launch a

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:59.520
war to recover or to take several hundred square miles of territory and tens of thousands of

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.320
people will die, I think seems absurd to us many people today, luckily, but it would not have seemed

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:09.440
absurd 50, 60 years ago, it would have just been a normal thing, these kind of territorial disputes

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.760
and so on. I think projecting in the future, I think within our lifetimes, we'll live to see

01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:23.200
that kind of conflict be eradicated. In part, you could say that why? I think it's because

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.400
of popular pressure and organization, so you could say the pro-worker socialist organizing part of

01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:34.000
it, making it less normal. If you're a capitalist, you could say, well, markets are more interlinked,

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:39.840
war is even more irrational. I don't really have a firm answer or whatever it is. I think it's a

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:45.440
good thing. You mentioned Marxist view of history, it's kind of interesting to just briefly talk

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:51.920
about. What do you think of it? What do you think of this Marxist view of how the different systems

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:57.840
evolve from the perspective of class struggle as we were talking about? Well, I fundamentally,

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:03.920
I'm a Marxist. I fundamentally believe in the broad contours of historical materialism,

01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:10.880
but I think we should be clear of what Marxist theory tells us and what it doesn't tell us.

01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:16.880
I think Marxist theory tells us pertinent things about how societies evolve, about how

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:23.040
the distributional resources work in any given society, who owns, who doesn't, how

01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.560
the conflict, distributional conflicts and so on. I think Marxism can tell us a lot.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:34.480
How surplus is distributed. Exactly, exactly. What it can't tell us is like,

01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:43.040
as a friend put it, the sex appeal of blue jeans or whatever else. That's beyond what Marxism is

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.800
meant to do. What economic system can tell us about the sex appeal of blue jeans?

01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:52.000
No economic system, but socialism in the Soviet sense, when it was turned into

01:50:52.960 --> 01:50:58.080
the Soviet style dialectical materialism, was meant to tell us everything from

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:08.160
explain genetics and agriculture and whatever else in a very disastrous way. I definitely don't

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:17.200
believe in the application of these ideas in an extremely wide way. Also, I'm a Marxist because

01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:23.920
it's a framework that helps me understand pertinent facts about the world. If at some

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:30.320
point I no longer think the framework is doing that, I will not be a Marxist, but I'm a socialist

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:36.560
on normative grounds because I have certain beliefs about the equality of people because

01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:44.480
we should have a society with liberty, with equality, with fraternity. I hope I'll always

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.480
be a socialist until the day I die, but it's a very unscientific or unserious thing to say,

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:54.720
this is my framework from beginning to end for the rest of my life.

01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:00.640
But from a perspective of history, I should say that Sir Marx says that societies go through

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:08.560
different stages. It could be crudely summarized as primitive communism, imperialism, maybe slave

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:18.080
society, feudalism, defined by mercantilism, then capitalism, then socialism, and finally

01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:26.160
stateless communism. Did I miss something there? I think that was close enough. I think that's

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:34.480
definitely true of Marxist theory, that the contradictions of capitalism, the fact that

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:42.000
it has brought together all these workers, all these materials and whatever else, and it's now

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.720
allowing us to socially create wealth on a mass scale, but that wealth, that process is being

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:57.040
privately directed, and also the surplus is being privately appropriated, is a contradiction,

01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:03.840
and that would lead to some sort of rebellion or revolution or change. Eventually, this contradiction

01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:09.200
would be a fetter on production too, so we would have to move into a socialist society.

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:14.480
But actually, just to backtrack, so in terms of contradictions, so it starts when we're in a

01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:19.120
village, hunter-gatherers, that's what you call primitive communism, where everyone's kind of

01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:25.040
equal. It's kind of a collective, right? All right, maybe you could just let me, hold on a second.

01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.880
And then inequalities form of different flavors, so that's what imperialism is, is

01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:35.360
one dude rises to the top and has some control of different flavor. That's what feudalism with,

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:41.200
when you have one dude at the top, and you have merchants doing some trading and so on, and then

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:47.200
that leads to capitalism, you have private ownership of companies, and they result in

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:54.080
some kind of class inequality. And eventually, that results in a revolution that says, no,

01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:58.800
that's, this inequality is not okay, it's not natural, it doesn't respect the value of human

01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:06.240
beings, and therefore it goes to socialism, where there is, under Marx's view, I guess some role for

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:14.320
the state. The state is doing some redistribution, and then the pure communism at the end is when

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:24.800
it's a collective, where there's no state centralized power. What's part of that is wrong?

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:32.640
No, I think broadly, the Marxist theory of history is about different types,

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:41.840
different modes of production that exist at various times, based on material conditions.

01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:48.720
In the early times, in this theory, there was not much surplus being generated,

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:56.960
and there was generally egalitarian societies. Then, as we became agricultural, as society

01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:02.880
developed, there was more surplus being produced. Then there was a group of people, the ruling

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:10.320
classes of their age, that controlled and distributed, that controlled that division

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:14.960
of labor and appropriated more of that surplus for themselves, and they weren't involved

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:19.360
in productive labor. In early print of society, everybody's involved in productive labor.

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:26.160
Later on, you had castes of priests who did nothing but pray and write and lecture people

01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:32.080
all day, and you had kings and rulers and bureaucrats and traders and so on. You have

01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:38.240
a more complex division of labor, but also more inequity driving out of that.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.160
Capitalism was a revolutionary system because it took away, one, it made us tremendously more

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:53.440
productive. It expanded production beyond our wildest imaginations, but it also no longer bound

01:55:54.480 --> 01:56:00.400
workers to their lord or manor or whatever else. They were now free to move, free to engage in

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:08.160
contracts with employers and so on. Even though workers are now producing all this tremendous

01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:15.280
wealth, and even though productive forces had been matured in such a way, they were ultimately

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:20.640
taken away from all the wealth they were created. They got some of it back. They were in wealthy

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.480
societies, but they were all there collectively together producing this wealth, and that was a

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:33.040
potent force. Marx theorized that would lead to a revolution or change in a socialist direction.

01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:42.960
I think, in fact, what we saw was that yes, capitalists are dependent on workers,

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:50.400
but the dependency is obviously symmetrical in the sense that workers are also dependent

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:55.520
on capitalists, but in fact, it's an asymmetrical dependency in that ordinary workers need their

01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:03.520
jobs more than capitalists need the contribution of individual workers. It became a collective

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:09.200
action problem where you would need the mass of workers to get together to decide to change

01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.720
things, but also people would be afraid because they'd be dependent on their jobs for their

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:20.320
livelihood and so on. Revolution became a lot harder than people thought, especially in democratic

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.680
countries where workers had certain outlets and certain powers and rights and responsibility.

01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:29.600
It's no surprise that where you did have socialist revolutions, they were in places like

01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:36.960
the Third World, post-colonial states trying to emerge out of colonialism. They were in places

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:44.880
like China and Russia, autocratic countries, and never in an advanced capitalist country.

01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:53.280
Now, in Marxist theory of history, even as interpreted by a lot of smart Marxists like

01:57:53.280 --> 01:58:01.600
G. A. Cohen and others, there is a certain inevitability to socialism after capitalism.

01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:07.200
The way that I would put it myself is I have a more, I guess you could say,

01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.200
Kantian view of it. I think socialism is something that ought to happen,

01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:20.080
but it's not something that necessarily will happen and will need to organize and persuade.

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:28.560
Also, potentially, again, the key part of any social system that's democratic is you have to

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:33.120
allow for the possibility of a democratic revision to a different sort of system.

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:37.760
I'd be more than happy in my vision of socialism for there to be capitalist parties

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:43.200
getting, hopefully, three, four, or five percent of the vote, maybe a lot more,

01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:47.840
in the same way that in the US or a republic, we could right now have a monarchist party.

01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:53.360
No one's going to support a monarchist party in the US in serious numbers.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:55.360
Although that's gaining popularity.

01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.320
In Europe or elsewhere?

01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:05.200
No. In anarchist tradition, aren't they saying that one of the ways you could have a leader

01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:10.480
in monarchy, because they're more directly responsible to the citizens? If you have a

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.040
leader, it's healthier to have a monarch. Anyway, I'm not familiar with this,

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.680
but I've heard this stated multiple times.

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:22.240
The left-wing anarchist traditions like anarcho-syndicalism or whatever else,

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:31.280
their slogan is no kings, no gods, no masters or whatever, so no bosses. They definitely

01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:37.040
would not agree with that, but I'm not familiar enough. Anarchism runs a gamut from

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.120
left to right in interesting ways.

01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:48.880
I'll have to ask you about that. You don't believe Marx's theory of history in the sense that

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.320
every stage is a natural consequence of every other stage. Of course, he would predict that

01:59:54.320 --> 02:00:00.160
somebody like you must exist in order for those stages to go from one to the next,

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:06.480
because you have to believe ought in order for action to be taken to inspire the populace to

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:07.040
take action.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:14.400
Two things. One is I do broadly believe in Marx's theory of history because it's just explaining how

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:22.320
productive forces develop in the relations of production in any given system. I guess there's

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:27.280
a theory of transition from capitalism to socialism that Marx didn't really spell out,

02:00:27.280 --> 02:00:32.880
but it was implied that it would naturally happen. Marx was living in an era of tremendous

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:40.000
upheaval. Marx himself actually saw when he was living in London in the 1870s the Paris Commune,

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.480
when workers took over for just a few months, but they took over the producers of Paris,

02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:47.840
took over the city, basically created their own government, their own system,

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:56.320
and so on. He was living through an era of upheaval. Engels especially oversaw and was

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:04.800
the mentor to all these rising socialist parties. He was very closely collaborating with socialists

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:09.520
in places like Britain and Germany when they were drafting their first programs

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:17.520
for the Social Democratic Party. It felt like this was going to happen. It felt like this rising

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:25.360
working class would take power, but I think the stability of the system was underestimated. It's

02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:30.080
easy to see the contradictions in the system, but can you see its mechanisms of stability,

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:36.800
the way in which mass collective action or revolution is more the exception or the norm?

02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:41.440
Could you have imagined if your Marx not only how much wealth the system would produce over time,

02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:47.280
which I think he could have imagined, but also developments like the welfare state and mass

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:53.520
democracy and universal suffrage, which might have changed how workers relate to the system or

02:01:53.520 --> 02:02:00.800
operate within it? It's just a transition part that I think wasn't spelled out properly,

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:08.000
but I think in either case, as socialists, we can assume that history is working in our favor. We

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:15.520
just need to hold out and wait for the inevitable revolution. We have to convince people of both,

02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.080
one, the struggle for day-to-day reforms and why it's important to be politically organized,

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:26.240
why it's important to be a member of a union or to advocate for things like universal health care

02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:33.520
or whatever else to try to build the cohesion and sense of self of the class, then ultimately

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:39.520
for the desirability once we accomplish it, once we build social democracy of going beyond social

02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.760
democracy, which is, of course, the challenge. Now, I don't think it requires leadership from

02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:49.440
the outside. I think there are plenty of organic leaders that have emerged from the working class

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:59.440
and have advocated for socialism from the working class. If you look at the class composition during

02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:05.040
the glory days of the European socialist parties, this was very much a working class

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.120
parties and organizations. It's only been the last 30 years that it's been taken over by professionals

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:18.960
and not coincidentally, they have accomplished very little in those 30 years.

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:27.200
So, that's the practical and the pragmatic. Can we actually jump to the horizon? As you mentioned,

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:32.240
as a social democrat, you focus on the policies of today, but you also have a vision and dream

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:38.880
of a future. And so, Marx did as well. So, the perfect communism at the end. Can you describe

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:47.840
that world? Also, is there elements to that world that has elements of anarchism? Like I said,

02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:53.360
there's Michael Malice next door. So, anarcho-communism, I don't even know if I'm

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.400
using that term correctly, but basically no central control. Can you describe what that

02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:04.000
world looks like? I think the traditional socialist vision of, if you want to call it,

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.240
full communism, would be very similar to the anarchist vision of a world without

02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:15.520
coercion and mass abundance and so on. I myself don't share that vision.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:28.720
I believe that we will always need to have a state in some form as a way to, one, even just

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:34.720
mediate difference. I think traditionally, a lot of Marxists have thought that after you remove

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:42.720
the primary contradiction of class, that all other political questions would be resolved.

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:45.680
And I think that's a lot behind a lot of the thinking of we're going to have a full

02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:50.720
communism after politics. I don't think there will be an after politics. I think,

02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.720
for one thing, let's say, I'll give you another Northeast example. Let's say me and you are trying

02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:01.200
to, with different groups of people, we're trying to figure out how to build a crossing of the

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.560
Hudson River. And for various reasons, you and the people around you want to build a bridge,

02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:13.040
me and the people around me want to build a tunnel. That's a question that you will

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:18.800
probably need a mediation for. One, it's a big project. There'll be a very complex division of

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:24.640
labor and so on. But even beyond that, just politically, you will need the state to mediate

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:28.560
the difference. You'll need to have a vote, have a vote that people trust, have institutions that

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:35.280
people trust, and so on, to make a decision. Society is never going to go beyond that decision

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:40.640
making. You don't think it's possible outside of the state to create stable voting mechanisms?

02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:48.320
Or is human nature going to always seep into that? I just wonder why we would have to if the state

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:54.000
is democratic and responsive. The state is an authoritarian. So it might not be called a state,

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.080
but it would function as a state, right? But why not just call it a state? But in other words,

02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:03.360
if you don't have something like that, then don't you have a greater risk of tyranny or a tyrant

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:09.680
emerging in the vacuum? So I think people's fear of the state is what would happen if the state had

02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:14.400
too much power. And I think that's a legitimate fear. That's why we have democratic checks on

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:22.720
state power and certain guarantees of freedom and so on. But yeah, I guess I just wonder,

02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:28.720
I'm more afraid of the vacuum and not having a democratic responsive state and what the world

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:34.320
would turn into. And also, I'm just not a utopian thinker, if that makes sense. I like to think

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:45.040
that I'm an egalitarian thinker. I'm a socialist. But my mind just goes to, I can see a vision of

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:51.440
the future that I would like 50, 60 years from now. Maybe there's some sort of future of super

02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:58.720
abundance and automation, and there's some sort of techno utopian future. We don't want some of

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:08.000
those things that would exist in my five minutes from now vision of socialism. But I just don't

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:16.640
see it. And in general, I'm kind of wary of visions of change that seem like they're not built off

02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:21.440
little pieces that we have now and not built off of history and experience and whatever else.

02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:26.560
I don't want a year zero. I don't even like the term prehistory because I think there's a lot

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.680
in history that I want. I want Shakespeare under socialism. I want a lot of things that I think

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:39.920
we should be grateful for. There's a part of tradition that I think that exists that's

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.160
hierarchical and exploitative and whatever else. But there's another part of tradition that's our

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:50.080
sense of place and belonging and our connection with the past and hopefully the future. And I

02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:56.720
want to keep that. Yeah. So you're worried about revolution or otherwise a vacuum being created

02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:03.120
and you're worried about the things that might fill that vacuum. So the anarchists often worry

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:11.440
about the same mechanism of the state that controls voting or keeps voting robust and

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:15.920
resilient and stable, the same mechanism also having a monopoly on violence.

02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:24.400
That's the tension. So they get very nervous about a central place having a monopoly on violence.

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:30.560
Whereas if there is going to be a place within a monopoly on violence, let's just say we temporarily

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:39.040
take that for granted. Should it not be a place with a skilled, elected, accountable, transparent

02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:45.920
civil service with a democratic mandate and so on? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well put. Speaking

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:50.800
of AI, just to go on that tangent, do you think it's possible to have a future world that's 50

02:08:52.160 --> 02:09:05.040
hundred years where there's an AI sort of central planning? We remove some of the human elements

02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:10.880
that I think get us into a lot of trouble. You can take a perspective on the Soviet Union and

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:16.240
the flaws of the system there have less to do with the different ideologies and more to do with

02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:21.040
the humans and the vacuums and how humans fill vacuums and the corrupting nature of power and

02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:28.480
so on. If we have AI that's more data-driven and is not susceptible to the human elements,

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:32.400
is that possible to imagine such a world? Almost like from a sci-fi perspective.

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.960
Maybe in the future you can imagine certain calculation problems that arose during central

02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:44.320
planning solved through advanced computing. But I would say that there's another whole

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:48.320
set of problems with the system that were incentive problems and I'm not sure how that

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:54.400
advanced computing would solve the incentive problems of how do you get people to actually

02:09:54.400 --> 02:10:00.000
produce things that other people want. Kind of that informational question, how do you communicate

02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:07.280
without endless meetings or someone reading your brain what you actually want? So there's

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:12.000
that kind of informational question but then there's the incentive of how do you get people

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:20.720
to work efficiently at work and how do you get firms to use their resources that they're getting

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:29.120
more efficiently. I think solving the calculation problem solves some of these questions but not

02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:35.760
all of them. That's kind of a who knows but if your vision of the future requires some sort of

02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:40.560
leap into a technological unknown that's very hard to advocate for today.

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:46.560
It's exciting to consider the possibility of technology empowering a better reallocation

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:55.040
of resources. If you care about the innate value of human beings and think of the mechanism of

02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:02.000
reallocation of resources as a good way to empower that equality, it's nice to remove the

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.520
human element from that. If you work really hard and you're really good at your job,

02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:11.600
it's nice to be really data driven in allocating more resources to you.

02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:22.160
I kind of think that the agency part requires human beings and conscious human activity.

02:11:22.880 --> 02:11:29.280
I think if you have a sort of planning system that works, and let's say the technology is

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.320
there for it to work, I would want it to be democratic planning in such a way. There is

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:39.040
a human element. There is some debate and deliberation in society. Also even in my vision

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:44.240
of socialism with the state sector and state investments and so on, I want there to be more

02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:49.040
public discussion and debate about certain things so it's not just left to technocrats because

02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:54.240
you'd want to live in society where you just find out the next day that there's some massive

02:11:54.240 --> 02:12:00.480
infrastructure project that you haven't had a chance to think about or debate or feel like

02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:09.040
you're participating in. And debate is not just facts and logic. That's why if the whole universe

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.480
was about facts and logic, computers could do a better job of that. There's something about

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:20.400
humans debating each other that goes into the difficult gray areas of what it means to be human

02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:26.240
and what it means to have a life that's worth living. That requires humanity.

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:31.920
I'm also worried about, while I'm excited by the possibility of AI controlling everything,

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:39.840
half joking, but the reason I'm really terrified of that is because usually there's a possibility

02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:44.880
of a human taking control of that system. You now start to get the same kind of authoritarian

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:52.480
thing. Well, I am a human. I'm smart enough to be able to control this AI system and I will do

02:12:52.480 --> 02:12:58.480
based on what this AI system says, what's good for you. It's kind of like talking down to people

02:12:58.480 --> 02:13:03.600
and then use that AI system to now have the same kind of thing as Hall and Moore in 1930s.

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:11.120
Also, our preferences might change. An AI system might say the goal of humanity is to just increase

02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:17.040
infinitely efficiency or increase output, whereas we might collectively decide that

02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:26.000
we have enough and we want to have a trade-off. I think that we need a system that allows for

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.320
people to make certain trade-offs. Have more of this leisure that I've been

02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:39.280
learning about from you. This is a very interesting concept, leisure. How do you spell that?

02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:48.080
If we can step into the practical, we were talking about historical and philosophical,

02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:54.240
into the practical of today. What are some of the exciting policies that represent

02:13:54.240 --> 02:14:00.400
democratic socialism today, modern socialism? I think you mentioned some of them, Medicare

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:06.240
for All or universal healthcare. Something you haven't mentioned is tuition-free college,

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:13.920
increasing minimum wage, maybe stronger unions like we talked about. What are some ideas here?

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.880
What are some ideas, especially policies, especially exciting to you?

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:22.400
Well, I think that hours reduction has always been an important demand for

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:31.360
socialists. It's been a reality in certain countries like France in recent decades where

02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:38.160
part of the logic is if you have a bunch of people working for 40 plus hours a week and you also have

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:42.720
some unemployed people who would like more employment, then it's not a zero sum game.

02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:49.600
You could reduce hours to 35 hours and still maintain the same output by employing more people

02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:57.120
to fill the slack in hours. One, I think it's a solidaristic thing in working-class movements

02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:03.920
between unemployed and employed workers. I also think that it gives people more time.

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:14.160
Marx was a big advocate in his day of a 10-hour bill in the UK that would reduce the hours of

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:23.680
working time and reduce child labor and other things as well. Part of it was this is a radical

02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:30.160
demand because it's reducing the sphere of exploitation. It's putting limits on how much

02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:34.640
time the capitalists can take from ordinary workers and how much freedom they would have.

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:42.800
With healthcare, one, I just think it's a government healthcare system. You could tell

02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.960
me that you don't want it in the US, but you can't tell me it doesn't work because we've seen it

02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:52.320
work in every other major industrial system in different forms. What does that usually involve?

02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:58.160
What does universal healthcare involve? There's different varieties. In the UK, for instance,

02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:03.840
they have a national health service in which medical personnel and hospitals are

02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:08.800
run directly by the state. It's almost like a mini Soviet system, to be honest, but just for

02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:16.000
healthcare. It works pretty well just for healthcare. I think it's one example of the way

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.760
in which you could actually take the market. I give you a vision of socialism that involves

02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:24.240
a lot of market, but I think there are certain spheres where you could remove the market from

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:36.160
and still have an efficient system in part because this is an area in which people don't have,

02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:42.400
obviously, for cosmetic procedures, whatever they have preferences. For most routine things that

02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:47.760
people do in healthcare, they just need to see a doctor. They need to get diagnosed.

02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:53.040
Some of these systems have had trouble with waitlists for specialists or whatever. That's

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:57.600
more of an allocation problem of if you want more specialists, you pay specialists more.

02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:04.240
This is problems that could be solved through the mechanisms of planning and government-run

02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.080
healthcare. That's the most left-wing that you could get is the system of the United Kingdom.

02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:14.480
Beyond that, you have a system like Medicare for All where you say,

02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:18.640
all right, most of the doctors, besides for public hospitals that already exist,

02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:28.480
are going to be privately employed by hospitals. The hospitals are going to be private, but instead

02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:33.920
of having all these different insurance carriers, we're just going to have one national insurance

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:38.720
carrier that we're all going to pay into. That national insurance carrier is going to negotiate

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:45.760
the price of healthcare with doctors, the price of drugs with pharmaceutical companies and so on to

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:54.720
hopefully reduce prices and to implement a different little bit of planning into the system

02:17:54.720 --> 02:18:00.960
because if there's only one big national insurance company, that company has a lot of weight and

02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:10.720
power, but you can still visit your same doctor and it's not as radical of a shift in that

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.280
direction. That's the dominant demand of Bernie Sanders and the left right now.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.880
There's 30 plus million people in the US that would be insured that currently aren't insured.

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:25.040
If we move to this system, there's a lot of other people that are underinsured or worried about how

02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:30.560
to pay co-pays or premiums involved. I think it would be a net benefit for the vast majority

02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:36.400
of the US population even if it was offset with certain taxes because we spend a lot of money out

02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:43.040
of pocket with health insurance. It's a demand also that's widely popular. For me, it's almost

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.600
like if you're trying to build support for something like socialism. We were talking

02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.280
this lofty vision of socialism after capitalism or what worker ownership the means of production

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:57.920
would look like in practice and so on. By the way, you're one of the few interviewers who

02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.200
ever asked me any of the details. It's good that I've been thinking of a rough sketch in my head

02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:12.320
for the last 16 years that I've been a socialist. We have to start in the here and now. If you can't

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:17.840
convince people that the state should play a bigger role in their health insurance and you

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:22.240
can't convince Americans and a whole host of other sectors that they should be living in something

02:19:22.240 --> 02:19:26.240
closer to a social democracy, how are you going to convince those people that there should be

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:31.840
worker ownership of the means of production? It's kind of a ridiculous leap if you don't

02:19:31.840 --> 02:19:36.960
have the credibility as the group of people organizing for universal health care, organizing

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:43.360
for a $15 benefit wage and able to get the goods. Also, in practice, as we fight for these reforms,

02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:50.480
ordinary people will have a better sense, at least my hope is, of what it means to be involved with

02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:56.080
politics and what politics can do for their lives. It's positive because right now,

02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:59.520
when we talk about politics, it often just seems that we're talking about

02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:08.800
a very glib cultural conflict removed from the things that are important in our lives,

02:20:08.800 --> 02:20:13.680
whereas in truth, I think politics can be a tool for us to make our lives better.

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:19.840
Yeah, and there's deep ideas here where in some sense, universal health care and worker

02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:27.360
collectives are not so radically different that there's philosophical ideas to explore and accept.

02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:33.680
And also from my perspective, at least, maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like with a lot of

02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:42.800
things at the core of politics, the right answer from an alien perspective is not clear. Everybody's

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:48.240
very certain of what's the right answer. Everyone's certain universal health care is terrible, or

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:51.920
in the case of universal health care, majority of people think it's a good idea,

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:57.360
but I don't think anyone knows. Because I think that depends on cultural history,

02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:02.640
on the particular dynamics of a country, of a political system, on the dynamics of the economic

02:21:02.640 --> 02:21:09.280
system in this country, of the changing world. The 21st century is different than the 20th century.

02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:14.960
Maybe the failures of communism in the 20th century will not be repeated in the 21st century,

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:19.280
or the flip side of that, maybe capitalism will actually truly flourish

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:24.320
with the help of automation in the 21st century. I don't think anyone knows.

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:31.360
People like you are basically arguing for ideas, and we have to explore those ideas together.

02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:36.320
Why do you think if universal health care is popular,

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:40.720
why don't we have universal health care in the United States?

02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:47.200
Democracy is a great thing. Political democracy is wonderful. It came from the struggles of

02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:53.680
ordinary people to expand suffrage and so on, but the economic sphere, entrenched power in the

02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:58.320
economic sphere, bleeds into our political democracy. I think there's a lot of people

02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:03.760
with a vested interest in not having universal health care. There's large industries with a

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:10.480
vested interest in not having universal health care. They pay for ads, pay lobbyists, they

02:22:10.480 --> 02:22:15.680
influence government, and they have made it very difficult. You can't get universal health care

02:22:17.040 --> 02:22:20.800
done without the bill, even if you pass something and you're trying to make a change.

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:24.320
Obamacare was supposed to have a public option. Everybody's been running on a public option

02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:27.920
in the Democratic Party for 12, 13 years. Why don't we have a public option?

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:32.480
People know that if people have the choice of buying into a government plan,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.960
that might be the slow road to really having universal health care. I think a lot of it's

02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:46.960
opposition. Do you like that idea, the public option? Isn't there complexities, pre-existing

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:56.000
conditions? Isn't a public option mean you can not have any insurance until you get into trouble?

02:22:57.760 --> 02:23:01.360
If it covers pre-existing conditions, just start paying for insurance then. Therefore,

02:23:01.360 --> 02:23:06.000
young people don't pay for insurance. Isn't it better to go full in?

02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:10.960
I don't support a public option in part because I think if we allow politicians to just say,

02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:16.320
hey, I support a public option, it's just kind of a way to signal your support for universal

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:20.800
health care but give us nothing. I think that's what we saw with Biden and a lot of other

02:23:20.800 --> 02:23:26.080
politicians that have supported a public option. I think in practice, if a public option is defined

02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:35.040
in such a way that it just means you by default can just opt into a public plan and let's say

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:39.120
hypothetically you don't even have to pay for it, then it's just a back door to universal health

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.360
care really quickly because I think the vast majority of people who aren't currently covered,

02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:47.680
and also a lot of employers to be honest would probably drop their private coverage if they knew

02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:52.720
their employees can just get a public option and maybe would only provide supplemental insurance

02:23:52.720 --> 02:24:00.400
or whatever else. I think the broad overarching point of all these demands is to say that

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:06.720
socialists need to be really connected to the day-to-day struggles of people to just improve

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:13.120
their lives. If you're feeling like you're paying $400, $500 on the Obamacare market for

02:24:13.120 --> 02:24:17.440
health insurance and that's hampering your ability to do what you want to do in your life,

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:22.960
then maybe you would support a candidate who's for universal health care. If you feel like you're

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:28.960
struggling to find work that you could afford to pay your rent with or whatever else, maybe you'll

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:36.880
support a candidate committed to all sorts of mechanisms to reduce housing prices or increase

02:24:36.880 --> 02:24:43.600
your power as a tenant and whatever else. I think it's like these day-to-day concerns

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:49.600
need to be connected to the more abstract and lofty vision of change. Otherwise, our politics

02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:58.960
just becomes this fantasy world thing that's nice ideas to think about or debate but really

02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:04.240
won't make much of a difference in people's lives. What do you think about free college?

02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:10.880
Should college be free? I would say free college is not at the top of my list of

02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:16.400
priorities, but it definitely should be free in my vision of a just society.

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:20.240
What is at your top? Just to clarify, is the universal health care up there?

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.400
Yeah, universal health care is probably far higher in my priorities than free college. I think right

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.840
now the way our system is built, when someone goes to college, they're given credentials,

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:34.480
they're given the degree they carry with them for the rest of their life, it gives them a chance to

02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:42.000
join a privileged part of the labor market. It's not a zero-sum game. I don't want college-educated

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:48.000
people to think that non-college-educated people are their enemies and vice versa because a lot of

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:52.480
them are just ordinary working class people trying to survive and they're in different areas or in

02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:58.960
different sectors. Some of them are in nursing sectors where they need a college degree and so

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:07.760
on. But if you just make college tuition free but you don't also make trade skills and other things

02:26:09.680 --> 02:26:14.000
free for someone to learn how to become an electrician or a plumber or whatever else,

02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:19.600
then to some degree you're privileging one sector of the labor market over another.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:25.680
I would advocate just if you're going to make something like that free, you just have to make

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:31.360
sure that you're doing it in an egalitarian way and that one, the options, the routes to college

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:40.560
are more equal. There's more investment in K-12 education so that more kids in rough neighborhoods

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.320
have the chance to go to college and for those that choose the trade route from any part of the

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:53.840
country, that they're given the skills and resources for vocational trainings and those

02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:58.640
are also free. It just feels like in terms of order of operation, I would just start with

02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:05.920
K-12 education, improving it and whatever else than college after, but I'm not opposed to it.

02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:12.720
Improving K-12 education, does that mean investing more into it? Is it as simple as just

02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.120
increasing the amount of money that's invested in public education?

02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:21.040
In general, when it comes to the public sector or any sphere that you're investing in,

02:27:21.040 --> 02:27:26.080
obviously, it's not just as simple as throwing money at a problem. I do think we have a lot of

02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:31.920
schools that are underfunded, but we have other schools that are adequately funded,

02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.240
but the conditions in which those schools are, like the neighborhoods they're in and what's

02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:41.840
going on in society, the problems are so deep that it's impossible for just education to

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:45.600
solve everything. I think especially a lot of liberals think that education should be the

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:51.200
panacea. Investing in education, you'll help people. If kids are living in poverty,

02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:57.680
if they go into school hungry or whatever else, education's not going to give them

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:05.440
everything they need to succeed. Sometimes we, I think, put too much weight on education.

02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:13.600
Of course, you can define education more broadly, which is the care of the flourishing of the young

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:20.800
mind, whatever that is. A lot of it starts early. A lot of it starts with ... New York City, at least,

02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:28.720
we do have universal pre-K. From age three onward, you have the option for that. It's

02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:35.120
important for kids' socialization. Their parents are now able to know that they could go to work

02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:40.480
or do something else and have their kids taken care of. There's a lot of measures like that that

02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:47.440
we could do to equalize things. Again, for libertarians in the audience, some of this stuff

02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:54.480
is scary because it's obviously more state involved. State involved in pre-K. State is already

02:28:54.480 --> 02:29:01.120
very involved in K through 12. More investment into state institutions like our state universities

02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:06.960
and in college. For me, it's not a question of state versus non-state. It's a question of

02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:16.640
good outcomes for people. It just happens to be that for working class people,

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:24.640
having the collective power to elect representatives that will build a broader safety net is in their

02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:28.960
interest. For upper middle class people, for others, they could afford to pay for their

02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:33.200
own provisioning either directly or through Obamacare-like schemes where you just get a

02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:38.480
subsidy and you pay the rest yourself and whatever. This is for really the bottom 40%

02:29:38.480 --> 02:29:43.040
plus of the population. They really don't have any options so they prioritize other things

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.840
and they end up with some sort of injury or health problem or whatever else. It's bad for

02:29:47.840 --> 02:29:51.600
everyone in society but it's especially bad for the people at the bottom of the labor market.

02:29:52.160 --> 02:29:56.880
I saw various estimates for socialist programs like social security expansion, free college,

02:29:57.840 --> 02:30:02.560
Medicare for all will cost upwards of $40 trillion over 10 years,

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:10.480
for zero. They could argue with those numbers and so on. There's a cost. There's a taxpayer cost.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:19.680
Given the weight of that cost, can you still make the case with these programs and then can

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:26.160
you try to make the case against them that the cost is too high? I will not argue with you on

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:29.840
the numbers because you just threw out random numbers. I do think universal health care,

02:30:29.840 --> 02:30:34.320
if done right, can be basically cost neutral. I think it's an exception because we spend a

02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:39.680
tremendous amount of money on health care, a huge percentage of our GDP. I think it could be done

02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:45.600
in a way that's close to cost neutral. Actually, can you argue on the numbers

02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:50.080
without arguing on the numbers? You're saying just your gut says that there's a lot of,

02:30:50.080 --> 02:30:55.120
depending on how these programs are done, there's a lot of variance in how much it will actually

02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:58.720
cost. There's a lot of bureaucracy and billing right now in our health care sector, for example,

02:30:58.720 --> 02:31:06.000
that would be eliminated. There's a lot of costs that are spiraling upward, provider costs from

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:11.760
both doctors, hospitals, but also pharmaceuticals and drug costs that insurance companies shoulder

02:31:11.760 --> 02:31:18.720
because their market share is too fragmented to really negotiate hard. Medicare can sometimes

02:31:18.720 --> 02:31:22.400
negotiate better rates, but Medicare for all would negotiate even better rates. I think there's a

02:31:22.400 --> 02:31:27.440
cost spiral that we can adjust with more government involvement. There's a reason why

02:31:27.440 --> 02:31:33.440
we spend a bigger share of our GDP on health care than other places, but let me just accept

02:31:33.440 --> 02:31:44.000
the broad premise that social programs cost money. Now, I think that one, for ordinary people,

02:31:44.960 --> 02:31:52.560
most of them, the trade-off, even hypothetically, if taxes on lower middle class and working class

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:58.960
people in certain cases go up, the trade-off would still be in their benefit because they're

02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:06.720
the ones who currently would be consuming more of those goods. Also, our tax system and whatnot is

02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:13.600
progressive, so the rich will pay more, the majority will consume more of them.

02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:18.320
Also, I think a lot of these programs are the bedrock of a healthy society.

02:32:20.400 --> 02:32:27.440
One reason, for example, that we have so much crime and violence in the US, there's lots of cultural

02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:35.200
and other causes with our level of gun ownership, American history, and so on, but one really

02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:41.200
important factor is just the level of poverty and inequality in the US compared to other countries.

02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:46.720
That combined with guns and other factors means that we live in more violent, unequal societies.

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:53.200
A European would be shocked by the fact that in even some of our nicest areas and

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:58.640
cities and elsewhere, because there's not a real violence too, it's just normal to have gun

02:32:59.440 --> 02:33:07.520
violence, it's normal to have drug-related violence. We have four or five hundred people

02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:14.480
some years in Baltimore, a city of under a million, getting killed. These are all recipes

02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:21.360
for a society in which, one, the public sphere is drunk like crazy because you're not going to

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:26.000
go wander out for an evening stroll in a park if you live in a dangerous area or whatever else.

02:33:26.800 --> 02:33:33.520
The rot goes very deep and a welfare state is one way to live in a better society for everyone.

02:33:34.080 --> 02:33:40.400
There's been plenty of studies. There's one book called The Spirit Level on inequality that was

02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:47.280
quite popular that just notes that inequality is really terrible for the psyches of the rich too,

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:53.680
not just for the poor. I think spending some more money living in a more just society is doable.

02:33:54.240 --> 02:34:00.640
There are different ways to address certain cost spirals. One reason why our welfare states are

02:34:00.640 --> 02:34:07.040
getting more and more expensive is in part just because our population is aging, but many of the

02:34:07.040 --> 02:34:13.360
same people who say we can't afford more in our welfare states because we're already spending so

02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.440
much on social security and all these other entitlements are the same people also for,

02:34:18.400 --> 02:34:26.000
one, closing borders so immigrants can't come in to help build the economy and to fill gaps

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:31.600
in the economy and also who aren't for things that will make it easier to have kids. I'm

02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:39.120
33 years old. I have a lot of friends who have been putting off having kids until they save up

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.960
X amount of dollars even though they have someone they could raise children with

02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:51.920
because they can't afford the cost of childcare. Their job probably won't give them more than four

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:58.400
or six weeks of family leave or whatever else. This is not the case in other countries. I think

02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:05.200
there's all sorts of benefits from having a bigger welfare state, but yes, there are costs

02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:09.360
and there are going to be certain trade-offs. It's not a magical thing where you could just

02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:13.920
have everything without trade-offs. In a progressive tax system,

02:35:17.680 --> 02:35:24.560
to push back on the costs here, is there a point at which taxing the rich

02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:30.080
is kind of productive in the long term? In the short term, there might be a net benefit of

02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:36.480
increasing taxes because the programs the middle class, the lower middle class gets is more

02:35:36.480 --> 02:35:44.960
beneficial. Is there a negative side to taxing the rich? In theory, yes, of course. One would be

02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:51.520
if you tax the rich so much, they change their consumption patterns and that has negative impacts

02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:57.360
on the economy as a whole. You would have to really model it out, but there would be a certain

02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:04.720
point in which the consumption changes might have net detrimental effects. I think that's

02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:11.680
more unlikely and the more likely scenario is you tax corporations and other

02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:21.440
wealthy people in society to the point that they have potentially less money for productive

02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:26.080
investment because you're in a capitalist society so you're reliant on capitalists to invest.

02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:32.080
You don't want to be in the worst of both worlds where you've gone too far for capitalism but not

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:38.720
far enough for socialism. In my vision, of course, of socialism, that's one reason why we'd have to

02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:45.440
take the investment function away from capitalists. If you're going to make it so hard for them

02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:50.720
that they can't invest or they can't employ labor the way they're employing now, you have to create

02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:59.600
another mechanism for supply to be created and that's a transition point. What about longer term

02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:05.600
de-incentivizing young people that are dreaming of becoming entrepreneurs and realizing that

02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.360
there's a huge tax on being wealthy? If you take these big risks, which is what's required to be

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:16.800
an entrepreneur, and you are lucky enough to succeed and good enough to succeed,

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.560
that the government will take most of your money away. I think realistically that's not a

02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:28.560
disincentive for most people. First of all, we already have a progressive taxation system.

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:34.080
The government does take a bunch of the money away and people are still striving to become

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:40.240
rich. A lot of what people want when they dream of success is they want accolades,

02:37:40.240 --> 02:37:48.240
they want respect, and of course, they want some more wealth to consume luxury goods with

02:37:48.240 --> 02:37:58.240
or whatever else. At a certain point, it becomes better for the state to tax and either redistribute

02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:05.680
directly or through social programs or redirect that money through tax credits and other ways to

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.240
shape investment towards productive investment. We don't want a society in which a bunch of rich

02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:15.040
people fly around in helicopters going from club to club while the productive economy

02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:22.960
does nothing. At that point, I think a lot of ordinary rich people might prefer the government

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:29.440
to come in to tax them and to try to spur investment in certain productive sectors.

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:37.440
It really just depends, but I honestly believe that most people don't necessarily want to be

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:41.840
rich for the sake of being rich. They want to be successful and there's many different

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:48.240
dynamics to that. Accolades and social respect is an important one of them. It's also why

02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:54.400
people who just become filthy rich often, the first thing they do is start out filling traffic

02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:59.120
trusts and try to give away their money because they want the social respect and accolades and

02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:05.200
whatever else. They don't want just their money. On that topic, a little bit of a tangent.

02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:14.080
There's a lot of folks in the left community, far left community, socialist community that

02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:21.520
I think are at the source of a derision towards the B word, the billionaires. Does it bother you

02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:28.000
or do you think that's in part justified using the word billionaire as a dirty word?

02:39:28.640 --> 02:39:34.080
I think it's perfectly justified that it's a popular shorthand. Obviously, when I talk

02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:41.600
about inequality, I often talk about power dynamics between workers and bosses and so on.

02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:48.080
Billionaire is just the 99%-1% version of it. It's just a popular shorthand to just explain

02:39:48.800 --> 02:40:00.000
the fact that there's a lot of people who have accumulated obscene wealth. These people aren't,

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:07.520
in my mind, parasites in the very, very old school socialist rhetoric.

02:40:11.760 --> 02:40:17.280
Capitalists provide employment, take entrepreneurial risks, come up with new ideas,

02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:22.720
sometimes themselves, sometimes directly manage work and whatever else.

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.800
They exert so much power over the lives of not just their workers but society as a whole.

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:39.440
Taking away some of their wealth and power is a way to just empower others. Again,

02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:45.520
these things have policy trade-offs. If you just snap your fingers and say,

02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:54.000
Elon Musk, all your wealth is gone, you're now on food stamps or whatever else in that arbitrary

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:59.680
way, you'd be a totally disincentivized people from trusting the rules of the game as they've

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:03.600
been set up in a capitalist society. I think that would have negative consequences for workers.

02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:10.640
But saying that, hey, this person has too much power and too much wealth and has too much ability

02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:19.040
to dictate things about the lives of others, I think is just simply a fact. I think it's true

02:41:19.040 --> 02:41:23.520
in the cases of people who are good people and have risen to this position, and it's true in

02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:28.320
the cases of people who are maybe not so good people and who have risen to these positions.

02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:33.520
I agree with you in part, but I have to push back here. One of the problems I see

02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.600
is using billionaires as shorthand to talk about power inequality and wealth inequality

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:48.320
often dismisses the fact that some of these folks are some of the best members of our society.

02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:55.200
So outside of however the system has created inequalities, a young person today

02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:03.440
should dream to build cool stuff, not for the wealth, not for the power, the fame,

02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:09.360
but to be part of building cool stuff. Now, there's a lot of examples of billionaires that

02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:15.680
have gotten there in shady ways and so on, and you can point that out. But in the same way,

02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:24.960
we celebrate great artists and great athletes and great literary icons and writers and poets

02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:34.800
and musicians and engineers and scientists. We should separate the human creator from the

02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:42.880
wealth that the system has given them. That's what I worry about is in our system, some of

02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:47.680
the greatest humans are the ones that have become rich. And so we sometimes mix up

02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:56.400
if you want to criticize the wealth, we sometimes criticize the human and the creator,

02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:59.200
while that should actually be the person we aspire to be.

02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:06.560
So I would agree with that. LeBron James, if he's not already in his lifetime, will be a billionaire

02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:14.480
and he got his money largely through just being an incredible athlete, excelling in his field

02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:19.360
more than anyone, besides for Michael Jordan. I think he's my number two. He might be my number

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:24.880
one. We'll see. Yeah, I'm willing to keep keeping open mind about the LeBron versus Jordan

02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:33.440
conversation. But he got that through his merit and he's been rewarded and a party is getting

02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:37.280
rewarded because he's created vast amounts of wealth beyond what he's getting. This is just his

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.480
share. It's the salary cap league. Whenever he's doing an endorsement, obviously that company

02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:47.280
is thinking that he's worth more than what they're paying him for that endorsement and so on.

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:53.440
And to the extent with Elon Musk, people see innovation and they see someone who

02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:59.840
will put himself out there with sometimes crazy ideas because he's trying to think about the

02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:05.280
future and trying to just push things forward instead of just sitting on whatever money he has

02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:12.640
now and just investing it earning 6% return for the rest of his life. I think that that's a

02:44:12.640 --> 02:44:18.400
positive thing. But I think it doesn't get to the broader policy question. When people invoke

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:26.560
billionaires, they're invoking the specter of inequality and power. It's not normally the

02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:34.640
rhetoric that I use because I propose and I use more traditional socialist rhetoric and terms,

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:39.120
but I think it gets at something real. Often with these sorts of shorthands we use in politics,

02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:46.960
they're imperfect, but they speak to a real thing.

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:54.720
And they feed a little bit of fun that folks like AOC and Elon have with each other. It feeds,

02:44:54.800 --> 02:45:01.280
it inspires, it serves as a catalyst for productive discourse. Speaking of which,

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:05.920
you said you're a fan of Bernie Sanders. Would you classify yourself as a Bernie bro? What's

02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:11.360
the technical definition of a Bernie bro? Is it a subset? No, no, no, I'm sorry. You're a sophisticated

02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:17.440
philosopher, writer, economic and political thinker. Of course you would not call yourself

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:21.680
a Bernie bro. I'm fine with calling myself a Bernie bro because it was made up by liberal

02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:30.320
journalist to smear Bernie and his supporters during the 2016 campaign, even though disproportionately

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:38.640
his supporters were young women in their twenties. But whatever, I think I'll ride for Bernie.

02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:44.160
There's worse things in the world being called a bro, so it's fine. What do you like about Bernie

02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:50.960
Sanders and to what degree does he represent ideas of socialism? To what degree does he represent

02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:58.240
the more traditional sort of liberal ideas? I love Bernie. Most of all, I like his clarity.

02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:06.240
He's by far the best communicator we have on the left. He speaks with a moral force. He's relatable

02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:13.600
and he's taken a lot of socialist rhetoric from academia and brought it down to its core in a way

02:46:13.600 --> 02:46:18.320
that's comprehensible for ordinary people and speaks to their daily lives. So when Bernie does

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:22.960
a speech, people can finish his lines because they know what he's going to say. They know what

02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:29.600
points he's going to hit because socialism in my mind should not be a complicated thing. Now,

02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:34.080
when we get to more abstract discussions about what a future system would look like, when we get to

02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:40.000
the policy trade-offs today, I think we need to put on a different hat. We should embrace all sorts

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:46.720
of nuance and contradiction and complication. When it comes to the core moral and ethical appeal,

02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:50.080
I think Bernie grasps that and how to communicate it.

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:57.440
Now, Bernie Sanders was politicized a very long time ago. I actually once told him,

02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:03.600
I've only met him a few times, but one time I joked that in his book, he mentioned that

02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:11.040
one politicizing moment in his life was when the Brooklyn Dodgers left town and he was devastated

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:17.040
because he was a Dodgers fan from Brooklyn. And I said, this is a 2020 campaign. This may be 2019.

02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:20.240
I said, Bernie, you're running for president. You do not need to keep reminding people your age.

02:47:25.920 --> 02:47:31.120
He was politicized through the Young People's Socialist League, which was an old offshoot

02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:35.280
of the Norm Thomas Socialist Party of America. So very old school socialist tradition.

02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:42.000
Then he was engaged in labor struggles in the 60s. He was engaged in the civil rights movement.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:48.160
So he came from this old left generation that I think just had a more plain spoken,

02:47:48.160 --> 02:47:52.960
more rooted way of understanding change and socialism. It wasn't, in my mind,

02:47:52.960 --> 02:48:00.880
polluted by academia and by some of the turn towards issues of culture and excessive focus

02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.000
on representation or whatever else. It was rooted. It was really rooted in something economic in a

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:11.520
way. Then obviously he had all his ideas and he was also a product of the left and that he

02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:16.160
went to Vermont. He kind of did the back to the land thing. He was basically not quite a hippie

02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:23.520
and affect, but he was out there trying to farm or whatever in cold as hell Northern Vermont.

02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:30.720
Then he decided to do politics, do electoral politics, and he failed for a long time.

02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:34.960
He did third party politics. He kept losing races. Eventually he became

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.200
savvy and luck in things he learned, the mayor of Burlington, Vermont,

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:47.040
and he just kept with the same message. In my book, I talk about, I quote, I think a Bernie speech

02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:53.120
from the 1970s, one of his early campaigns, and I compared it to a Bernie speech

02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:58.800
during his 2016 campaign. It was virtually identical. Millionaires were swapped with

02:48:58.800 --> 02:49:02.480
millionaires and billionaires, speaking of billionaires, which is beautiful.

02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.760
I think there's something great to what he offered American politics. Also, all around the world,

02:49:09.760 --> 02:49:14.160
there's a socialist poll in politics, whether you agree with it or not, in all these countries

02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:20.160
in Europe and any rich country, Japan and so on. The US really didn't have that. The furthest left

02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:29.200
you could go was like Chris Hayes and MSNBC or whatever. I'm very glad that there's a socialist

02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:36.080
poll, and I think we have Bernie to thank for it, to the extent that a lot of self-described

02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:41.280
socialists don't think Bernie is a real socialist. It's in part because he stays grounded in people's

02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:48.160
day-to-day lives and struggles. I don't think he thinks often the way that I do and other people

02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:55.120
more disconnected or step or move from day-to-day politics think about the future contours of a

02:49:55.120 --> 02:50:01.280
socialist society and so on, but I think he's morally committed to an egalitarian different

02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:08.400
sort of future. I don't think he, at least I haven't heard him talk about this big, broad

02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:13.520
history and future, the Marxist ideology and so on. Not that he's afraid of it or something,

02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:17.440
it's just not how he thinks about it. Yeah, I think he's a practical thinker and also,

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:25.520
yeah, he should be afraid of it too because he is a major politician running for president.

02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:34.320
I think what people want is they want the left wing of the possible, or at least the segment of

02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:38.000
the party that was voting for him, the Democratic Party is voting for him. They wanted something

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:44.800
that was a step or two removed from what they had now and was visionary, but not so far removed that

02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:52.160
it seemed like a scary leap. I think we lost a chance in 2016 to elect someone that I think

02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:58.160
would have beaten Trump or at the very least would have been close.

02:50:58.160 --> 02:50:59.920
Do you think the Democrats screwed him over?

02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:07.280
Yes, not in the way of deliberate or direct vote rigging, but they put their thumb on the scale

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:13.520
for sure. It's not even conspiracy theory. There's all this stuff in the debates about

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:19.920
Clinton's people being fed questions and whatever else and just the tone of the media.

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:25.920
The media was extremely dismissive and hostile to him. I love that Bernie still does a Fox News

02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:31.440
town hall with his, they're just him speaking to the people and he's not afraid of going on

02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:38.480
any sort of outlet and making his case, but I think a lot of the liberal media in particular

02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:41.280
always had it out for Bernie Sanders.

02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:46.560
What was that? Because that was really annoying. That was really annoying how dismissive they were.

02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:52.480
I've seen that in some other candidates. They were dismissive towards Andrew Yang in the same

02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:58.000
way. So forget the ideology. Why are they so smug sometimes towards certain candidates?

02:51:58.640 --> 02:52:03.600
What is that? Because I think that's actually at the core to a degree if Democrats or any party

02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:07.600
fails that it's that smugness because people see through that.

02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:11.840
I think a lot of these people are friends. Even if they don't know each other,

02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:16.800
they're friends because they went to the same schools. They know the same people. They have

02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:21.600
the same broad just ideology and worldview. So they had a sense of what the Democratic

02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:26.560
party should be and who it should be running and who is going to win and also what was serious

02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:32.800
and on serious. So Bernie would say some things about the world that objectively to a lot of

02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:38.560
people seem correct or at least pretty close to correct and a journalist would just look at

02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:43.520
him like he's from outer space. To some extent, this also happens to people on the right. People

02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:53.200
on the right often say things that I find repulsive or just wrong, but there's parts of the media

02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:59.200
that would describe their certain views as illegitimate or outside the boundaries of

02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:04.400
acceptable conversation. I think there should be a few things outside the boundary of acceptable

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:13.520
conversation, hate speech and so on. But there's this attempt to say their views are illegitimate

02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:18.080
and therefore anyone who votes for them for any reason is illegitimate too. And that's one reason

02:53:18.080 --> 02:53:24.800
why I think it's fueled a lot of resentment and will ultimately end up fueling the extremes of

02:53:24.800 --> 02:53:30.320
American politics and people feel like they're not being listened to. And some of it is also

02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:37.600
style of speaking and personality, where if you're not willing to play a game of civility,

02:53:38.720 --> 02:53:43.280
there's a proper way of speaking if you're a Democrat. If you're not doing that kind of

02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:48.320
proper way of speaking, people dismiss you. I think in certain sense, whatever you feel about him,

02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:54.400
people dismiss Donald Trump for the same reason, where it's the style of speaking

02:53:54.800 --> 02:54:00.160
the personality of the person. He's not playing by the rules of polite society,

02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:08.320
of polite politician society and so on. And that troubles me because it feels like solutions,

02:54:08.320 --> 02:54:17.360
the great leaders will not be polite. They're not going to behave in the way they're supposed to

02:54:17.360 --> 02:54:23.840
behave. And I just wish the media was at least open-minded to that, which I guess gives me hope

02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:30.000
about the new media, which is more distributed citizen media, that they're more open-minded

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:41.280
to the revolutionary, to the outsiders. I really like Bernie Sanders. I first heard him

02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:52.640
in conversation with Tom Hartman. He had these weekly conversations and just the authenticity

02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:56.640
from the guy. I didn't even know any context. I didn't even know, honestly, he was a Democratic

02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:01.440
socialist or anything. The authenticity of the human being was really refreshing. And when he,

02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:07.440
I guess, decided to run for president, that was really strange. I was like, surely this person

02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:15.040
has no chance. Just like he seemed too authentic. He seemed like he's not going to be effective

02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.120
of playing the game of politics. So it was very inspiring to me to see that you don't necessarily

02:55:19.120 --> 02:55:23.840
need to be good at playing the game of politics. You can actually have a chance of winning. That

02:55:23.840 --> 02:55:32.160
was really inspiring to see. What about some of the other popular candidates? What do you think

02:55:32.160 --> 02:55:38.560
about AOC? I don't know if she self-identifies as a socialist or not. She does self-identify as a

02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:46.000
Democratic socialist. I think she was a very inspiring figure for a lot of people. She was

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:51.360
kind of out of this Bernie wave with the first set of Bernie candidates in 2018 that identified

02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:57.840
with him instead of the Democratic party establishment. I think that she's still

02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:05.680
developing as a politician. It's very difficult when you're in a deep blue district and when

02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:14.080
you don't often have to worry about reelection or talk to or modulate your rhetoric to win over

02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.240
swing voters in your district. But then you're immediately a national and cultural figure.

02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:25.920
AOC basically goes from her views, which are compelling in my mind. A lot of her

02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:31.520
programmatic views are compelling. Wins her district and then has her own rhetoric,

02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:37.680
which to me compared to Bernie owes itself more to the academic left and the way that a lot of

02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:42.640
the left has learned to talk. I don't mean academic in the sense that she's like a Marxist or whatever

02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:49.680
else, but academic in the way that she may be using at times confusing language to convey

02:56:49.680 --> 02:56:56.160
basic points when she gets into the language of intersectionality and whatever else.

02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:59.040
Especially in the context of cultural issues and stuff like that.

02:56:59.040 --> 02:57:03.200
Exactly. Instead of just the plain spoken Bernie, like, yeah, discrimination is wrong.

02:57:03.200 --> 02:57:06.880
If you ask me about a cultural issue, I'll come down on the same side as AOC, I'm sure,

02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:14.800
nine plus times out of 10. But I'll try to root it into just basic, like, yeah,

02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:18.800
treat people with respect. And they'll treat you with respect. And that's the way we should

02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:24.560
govern our civic sphere. And we don't need to talk about intersectionality to get that.

02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:31.200
So there's that rhetoric. But she's not just a regular congressperson in a deep blue district,

02:57:31.200 --> 02:57:38.640
she's also a national and international cultural and political figure. So she's now a spokesperson

02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:45.520
because of largely like a media event of her surprising upset election and her being young

02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:54.080
and being really connected to this post Bernie moment. And I think amid these constant one attacks

02:57:54.080 --> 02:58:00.960
on her from the right and also this media attention and this notoriety, she hasn't

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:07.120
really modulated or adjusted her audience, her rhetoric and how do you win over someone who

02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:13.360
really hates a lot of your ideas, but might actually believe in some of your policies.

02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:22.640
And I think she's been ineffective, quite frankly, in the last year making that transition,

02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:27.760
whereas I think other politicians who are not so far left, who don't identify as socialists,

02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:32.640
let's say John Fetterman has managed to become more effective. And I don't think it's a question

02:58:32.640 --> 02:58:38.880
of character or whatever else. And I like AOC. So I don't want to put it so harshly. But I think a

02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:44.720
lot of it has to do with her being a congressperson in a deep blue district and Fetterman being running

02:58:44.720 --> 02:58:52.320
for statewide office in a quote unquote purple state. But at her best, she does it. But it's

02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:58.720
like glimmers. What sport are you biggest fan of? I'll give you a sports analogy.

02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:04.640
I mean, NFL is up there, soccer is up there, but probably UFC.

02:59:04.640 --> 02:59:08.960
Okay. Well, I can't give you a good analogy for any of those, but it's like a raw prospect.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:15.200
Someone who shows glimmers of hope. So they were drafted really high and they bounce from

02:59:15.200 --> 02:59:22.240
team to team. And you're like, I'm clinging on to my AOC stock. But I think that she needs

02:59:22.240 --> 02:59:26.160
to be self-critical enough and her team needs to be self-critical enough to know that the goal is

02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:32.160
not merely to be a national cultural figure and win a reelection near a deep blue district. The

02:59:32.160 --> 02:59:37.760
goal has to be to become truly a national political figure, which will require changes.

02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:43.600
A unifier and inspiring figure about the ideas that she represents.

02:59:43.600 --> 02:59:47.920
Definitely. And she has other things against her. I'm obviously class focused, but there's no

02:59:48.640 --> 02:59:53.680
denying I think that some of the hostility to her is sexism. It's rooted in I think people

02:59:54.880 --> 02:59:59.120
wanting to see her fail or whatever else, but that's only some of it. I think some of it

02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:06.720
otherwise is her struggling to relate to people who don't have a lot of her starting points as

03:00:06.720 --> 03:00:11.360
far as moral and ethical beliefs. Yeah. But she's actually great at

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:17.360
flourishing in all the attacks she's getting. She's doing a good job with that. And a lot of

03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:22.560
those attacks would break me if I'm being honest. Yes. The amount of fire she's under.

03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:29.360
But you don't want that to become a drug to where you just get good at being a national figure

03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:33.760
that's constantly in the fights and are using that for attention and so on. You still want to

03:00:33.760 --> 03:00:38.320
be the unifier. And that's the tricky, tricky switch. Do you think there's a chance there's a

03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:46.480
world in which she's able to modulate it enough to be a unifier and run for president and win?

03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:55.440
I think she's very far away from being able to do that. I think that even other politicians that

03:00:55.440 --> 03:01:00.880
are also polarizing within the squad in terms of what they say or their ideas, whatever else,

03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:04.800
are very effective communicators like Ilhan Ammar and others.

03:01:08.880 --> 03:01:17.600
That's my hope. My hope is that someone like AOC could. The last year plus has not been extremely

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:23.920
promising in my mind, in part because she's continued to position herself as a lightning

03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:34.000
rod cultural figure. Whereas I think a national political figure needs to pick their spots and

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:39.520
also pick their moment for changing their rhetoric and adjusting to their audience.

03:01:39.520 --> 03:01:43.040
I think she does it in certain environments, but that needs to be your national

03:01:43.040 --> 03:01:49.920
message when you're out there. You need to be speaking towards the not already converted.

03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:54.160
I think Bernie does that. Bernie strips his politics down to the basics.

03:01:55.920 --> 03:02:02.960
I agree with you spiritually, but we also have an example of Donald Trump winning the presidency.

03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:10.640
Isn't some of the game of politics that's separate from the policy

03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:18.480
being able to engage in rhetoric that leads to outrage and then walking through that fire with

03:02:18.480 --> 03:02:25.520
grace? First of all, I think Trump is a unique personality in American history, so it's hard to

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:33.440
compare anyone to Trump. Don't you think AOC is comparable in terms of the uniqueness

03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:41.200
in the political system we're in or no? I think Trump is much more of a firebrand anti-establishment

03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:49.840
force. I mean this negatively for what it's worth because I disagree with Trump, but he was willing

03:02:49.840 --> 03:02:58.000
to set fire to the Republican establishment. He was able to self-fund largely his campaign,

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:03.920
and he already was a media figure without them. AOC has been much more cautious with the Democratic

03:03:03.920 --> 03:03:08.640
Party establishment, in part because she's not trying to run a national political campaign right

03:03:08.640 --> 03:03:12.320
now for the outside, like a 5% chance they're going to be president. Let me set fire to

03:03:12.320 --> 03:03:17.520
everything. She's trying to help people and help her constituents through the game of getting

03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:23.600
committee appointments and getting wins on the margins. I think that's understandable

03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:30.560
for what it's worth, but in the process, I think what's the difference between AOC and a progressive

03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:34.880
Democrat? During 2016, it used to be pretty easy to say the difference between the Bernie

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:41.280
Kratz and a progressive Democrat because we were establishing our own outside third force in American

03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:46.000
politics. You could knock on the door of a lot of people who would end up voting for Trump,

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.920
and they would say, oh, I have a lot of respect for Bernie or whatever. They're still going to

03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:59.200
not vote for him, but he wasn't considered part of the Democratic Party milieu. I think now with AOC,

03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:05.360
there's a much closer association of AOC in our policies with ordinary Democrats,

03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:11.680
whereas she needs to draw stronger distinctions. She does need to do it like Trump did with just,

03:04:11.680 --> 03:04:15.440
man, I forgot all of them, though I found some of them amusing in the moment, like all his nicknames

03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:25.680
about a lion Ted Cruz and then the rest. I do feel like she needs to differentiate herself a bit more,

03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:33.600
but then also just keep her language simple. Trump was more complex than Bernie in his

03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:39.360
literal language, but he was repetitive and there was kind of a rhythm and a cadence to Trump's

03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:47.200
speech. I think AOC needs to, like Bernie, reduce her rhetoric down to a couple key lines and

03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:53.520
signatures and focus her politics not on 20 issues, but on three or four most important issues and

03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:57.760
have that message discipline. Bernie will do an interview with you and he'll write down,

03:04:58.800 --> 03:05:05.440
I hope you do interview Bernie, but he'll write down like five things and I'm only going to talk

03:05:05.440 --> 03:05:09.040
about these five things. Ask me about this? Okay, I'm talking about these five things.

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:14.400
So that's a message discipline that Bernie has been exemplary on, yeah, for sure. But I think

03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:18.240
that's learned, that could be developed. I think she could develop it. Listen, I'm

03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:24.160
answering your question, I think, not the way I should answer it. Being someone broadcasting to

03:05:25.760 --> 03:05:35.280
people on the left and elsewhere, I hope AOC goes in that direction. I just think that

03:05:35.280 --> 03:05:41.840
she has a lot going against her just because she's already a national figure and she's in a

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:47.280
deeper blue district. But we need to root our politics then in working class people and a lot

03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:53.920
of districts that, I don't know, the type of kitchen table conversations are, I hate that

03:05:53.920 --> 03:05:58.720
cliche, but I just used it. But a lot of these conversations are just different in their tone

03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:05.920
and cadence. And it's not just a question of Fetterman or Tim Ryan in Ohio and kind of just

03:06:05.920 --> 03:06:12.560
white working class voters. I mean, working class voters of any race. Their day-to-day needs and the

03:06:12.560 --> 03:06:21.280
day-to-day things they want to talk about is just at a different plane than a Met Gala cultural

03:06:21.280 --> 03:06:25.920
statement. Yeah. I mean, it's clear that you respect and love her and would like to see

03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:31.520
different ways. I mean, she's young, so the different trajectories that she could develop

03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:37.120
that would ultimately make her a good candidate. I'm just looking at odds here. And I disagree

03:06:37.120 --> 03:06:44.240
with them. I'm buying AOC stock here, given these odds. So in terms of Democratic, who's going to

03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:50.720
win the 2024 election? So that includes running and winning. On the Democrat side is 18% chance

03:06:50.720 --> 03:07:00.320
for Biden, 7% chance for Kamala Harris, Gavin Newsom at 6%, Michelle Obama at 3%, Hillary Clinton at

03:07:00.320 --> 03:07:09.760
2%, and AOC at 1.5%. And then Bernie at 1%. So I would not buy AOC at that mark. I would buy Biden

03:07:09.760 --> 03:07:16.800
like crazy though. I'm not a gambling man, but I would totally toss a G at Biden at that amount.

03:07:17.520 --> 03:07:25.840
AOC at 1.5% chance? I don't think she runs. You don't think she runs? Yeah. OK. I don't think

03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:31.120
Bernie will primary Biden either. I mean, if Biden doesn't run, then obviously it's an open field.

03:07:31.120 --> 03:07:37.200
But I just feel like... Do you think Biden runs? Yes. I think Biden probably runs.

03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:45.360
Oh, boy. He's an incumbent president. So it's very hard to imagine another Democrat being

03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:52.400
able to do better than him. All right. What about the competition? I think Donald Trump is the best

03:07:52.400 --> 03:07:57.760
thing for the Democrats, period, just because it would create this turnout mechanism, this excitement

03:07:57.760 --> 03:08:03.920
around we have to stop Donald Trump. He's attacking DeSantis. I mean, already he's trying to...

03:08:05.200 --> 03:08:13.760
DeSanctimonious thing. Trump's kind of like the Don King of American politics.

03:08:15.840 --> 03:08:20.080
Yeah. It's interesting what kind of dynamic chaos he's created.

03:08:20.800 --> 03:08:28.160
It probably led to more people being interested in politics. Well, almost guaranteed it led to

03:08:28.160 --> 03:08:32.720
more people being interested in politics, but maybe not in a healthy way. Maybe it created

03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:39.360
an unhealthy relationship with politics where it created more partisanship. For me, I don't have

03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.720
a problem with partnership. It's what kind of partnership. So I think Trump has cultivated

03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:50.640
a lot of right populists, a relationship with his supporters. It's almost like a leader follower

03:08:50.640 --> 03:08:55.920
relationship and a way that doesn't actually enhance people's knowledge of politics and the

03:08:55.920 --> 03:09:02.720
issues, but actually just leads them to follow the party line. Ideally, I think socialist politics

03:09:02.720 --> 03:09:08.080
and politics on the left should be something different. Eugene Debs, the great American

03:09:08.080 --> 03:09:14.240
socialist leader of the late 19th and early 20th century, used to say, I'm not your Moses,

03:09:14.240 --> 03:09:20.640
I can't promise to lead you to the promised land because if I can lead you there and you just follow

03:09:20.640 --> 03:09:25.440
me there, someone's just going to lead you straight out as soon as I'm gone. And I think there's

03:09:25.440 --> 03:09:33.680
something nice about that kind of anti-blind following leader follower kind of dynamic on

03:09:33.680 --> 03:09:41.920
the left at its best. That said, in the way at least the political race in the United States

03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:48.240
has turned out, it seems like it's turned into a bit of entertainment and they're having

03:09:49.600 --> 03:09:56.320
personalities and characters is really important. So in terms of policy and actual leadership,

03:09:56.320 --> 03:10:05.040
yes, maybe having a leader, like an authoritarian big leader is not good, but maybe for the race it

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:12.560
is for the drama of it. You just want to have drama and attention on people who are actually

03:10:12.560 --> 03:10:15.760
going to turn out to be good leaders. That's a weird balance to strike.

03:10:15.760 --> 03:10:19.920
Yeah, earned media is what they always talk about, right? In political campaigns,

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:28.960
like the more you could get on TV, the better. I really like Federman, he just won his campaign,

03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:33.840
but a good part of his early campaign, he had pivoted from talking about issues to just talking

03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:38.000
about Dr. Oz living in New Jersey and kind of having the troll campaign against him,

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:45.360
which I found amusing, but also it was effective, obviously one, but it's a bit depressing because

03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:52.320
I would have rather a whole campaign cycle about healthcare and jobs and other issues.

03:10:53.600 --> 03:11:00.960
Yeah, and the hope is that people just get better at that kind of social media communication. So

03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:06.400
I do actually think there's something about doing political speeches that makes you sound

03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:15.520
less authentic because you have to do so many of them. It must be exhausting to day after day

03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:21.680
after day make the speech. You're going to start replaying the same stuff over and over,

03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:25.120
as opposed to actually thinking about the words that are coming out of your mouth,

03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:29.360
and then the public will know that you're not really being that authentic. Even though you

03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:35.040
believe those things, it's just tough. I just wish they didn't have to constantly do speeches.

03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:41.280
So I think that the fact that Bernie's speeches very clearly came out of, if not directly his

03:11:41.280 --> 03:11:45.280
own pen, but his own rhetoric over the years, and he kind of wrote it seemed authentic,

03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:50.960
even if he was repeating it. And then Trump, his just wild improvisation, I think people found

03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:57.440
real in a certain way. And I would love for the left more generally to tap into some of that

03:11:57.440 --> 03:12:02.640
anti-establishment sentiment, but obviously do it in a way that's productive, that doesn't blame

03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:08.560
immigrants or whatever else for problems, but it's kind of built on a different basis. But

03:12:09.120 --> 03:12:14.720
people are fed up for good reason with a lot of conventional politics, and we need to speak to

03:12:14.720 --> 03:12:20.800
that. Otherwise it'll only be the right that is taking advantage of those people's anger.

03:12:21.600 --> 03:12:26.480
Well, I almost forgot to ask you about China. So both historically, we talked about the Soviet

03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:31.840
Union, but what lessons do you draw from the implementation of socialism and communism in

03:12:32.800 --> 03:12:37.200
Maoist China and modern China? What's the good and the bad?

03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:44.320
Well, I think it's very similar to the Soviet case in that socialism came to China

03:12:46.480 --> 03:12:52.400
through not a base of organized workers in a capitalist country at a certain level,

03:12:52.400 --> 03:12:59.600
development and so on. But it came through the countryside and in conditions of civil war,

03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:06.960
strife, Japanese invasion and whatever else. And Mao built his base in the peasantry, then came

03:13:06.960 --> 03:13:13.680
down to the city to govern and try to build a base and rule over workers. So it was kind of an

03:13:13.680 --> 03:13:21.280
inversion of classic socialist theory. Now, the same thing that I said before about Stalin and

03:13:21.280 --> 03:13:25.920
assessing the Soviet Union has to apply here because obviously, I oppose authoritarianism

03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:37.040
and all sorts of moral condemnations I should do. But to look at what the Chinese Communist Party

03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:43.920
actually accomplished, I think we kind of need to take a step backwards from our moral opposition

03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:47.120
to the means in which they accomplish it and just look at it developmentally.

03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:57.280
China benefited greatly from the Communist Party's implementation of basic education and

03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:03.200
healthcare. So in a lot of China, you had one of the conditions women were absolutely terrible,

03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:09.840
they were still foot binding and all sorts of like terrible backward practice. You had a huge

03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:14.400
vast majority of the population that was illiterate without any access to basic education and you had

03:14:14.400 --> 03:14:20.320
no health access, especially on the countryside. So those are the three good things that China did,

03:14:20.320 --> 03:14:29.840
improve the status of women, get everyone into primary education and improve the lot of healthcare.

03:14:30.880 --> 03:14:37.840
Besides for that, their agricultural campaign was a failure, just like Stalin's for many of

03:14:37.840 --> 03:14:45.680
the same reasons I mentioned before. The great leap forward and crash industrialization didn't

03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:58.240
really work either. In a way, is China better than India or other countries that didn't have the

03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:05.840
basic education and the strong state authority and the health improvements and whatever? I think

03:15:05.840 --> 03:15:12.880
maybe, but I think that's why we need to sometimes go beyond just economic measures of success.

03:15:13.680 --> 03:15:19.360
Because if you told me tomorrow, the US will grow at 3% if we maintain democracy,

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:24.880
but it'll grow at 8%, 9%. Everyone will be wealthier if we move to some sort of authoritarian

03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:29.200
government. I think you're asking the wrong question if you're going to make your decision

03:15:29.200 --> 03:15:33.840
based on growth, right? Because it has to be based on some sort of principle. But the same

03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:39.360
dynamic of from the beginning, the Chinese Communist Party ruling over people emerging

03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:45.040
from the outside through armed conflicts and ruling over ordinary Chinese people have continued.

03:15:46.240 --> 03:15:52.000
Since Deng Xiaoping, the policies have been better economically and often at times, not always,

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:58.640
the technocratic governance has been quite good. But that doesn't mean that the party has a

03:15:58.640 --> 03:16:05.920
democratic mandate or should have the right to govern as they see fit. Because clearly,

03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:12.320
it doesn't have that mandate in swaths of the country or in places like Hong Kong or elsewhere.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:20.720
But to me, nothing the Chinese Communist Party does has anything to do with socialism. I think

03:16:20.720 --> 03:16:27.760
even by their own definition today, it really doesn't. It's a sort of nationalist authoritarian

03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:32.960
developmental state that has done some good things to improve the living standards of the

03:16:32.960 --> 03:16:38.960
Chinese people, other things that were counterproductive. And as a democratic

03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:46.640
socialist, I certainly don't support that state, but I also hope that the US and Biden will find a

03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:54.960
way to avoid intense rivalry and competition economically spilling over into something worse.

03:16:55.600 --> 03:17:03.360
From a democratic socialist perspective, what's one policy or one or two ways you could fix,

03:17:03.360 --> 03:17:07.520
if you could fix China, if you took over China, what would you like to see change?

03:17:07.520 --> 03:17:11.680
Well, the democratic part comes before the socialist part. So I would say there needs

03:17:11.680 --> 03:17:19.360
to be multi-party elections in China and state censorship and control over the press, in other

03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:27.680
words, needs to be done with. As far as their immediate economic policy, I think the idea of

03:17:27.680 --> 03:17:33.680
maintaining strong state control of certain commanding heights of the economy while liberalizing

03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:42.400
other spheres has done quite well in China's case, lifting people out of poverty. But again,

03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:51.280
there's something really lost in society, even if it's getting wealthier, if ordinary people don't

03:17:51.280 --> 03:18:00.080
have the ability to participate in dissent freely. And the Chinese authorities have allowed some,

03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:04.640
it's not North Korea, it's not a totally totalitarian state. There's been workplace

03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:10.240
protests, there have been all sorts of local anti-corruption protests and things like that,

03:18:10.240 --> 03:18:14.240
but the government decides what's permitted and what's not at what particular moment.

03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:23.120
And I think the long run, even if it can survive, there's a better way to do things,

03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:28.960
which is quite simply a democracy. The thing is, though, the lessons of history

03:18:29.760 --> 03:18:36.640
China is looking at, there's this dark aspect. So building on top of the fact that it seems like

03:18:36.640 --> 03:18:42.960
under Stalin and under Mao, under Stalin, the Soviet Union, and under Mao, China has seen a

03:18:42.960 --> 03:18:50.880
lot of economic growth. And then one dark aspect of that, while under the Great Leap Forward, you

03:18:50.880 --> 03:19:00.720
have upwards of 70 million people dead. Today, I think there's a large number of people who admire

03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:07.120
Stalin and admire Mao. What they admire is the stability and the strong leadership.

03:19:08.480 --> 03:19:13.760
There's a lot of people who miss the Soviet Union. The reason why they miss it is that

03:19:13.760 --> 03:19:19.280
it was a system they knew, it provided the basics of their livelihood. Then afterwards,

03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:23.920
look at Russia in the 90s, people were in chaos. The Communist Party had a huge amount of support

03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:28.800
democratically. Anti-democratic measures had to be taken, ironically, against the Communist Party

03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:37.760
to keep it from regaining more of a foothold in Russia. But we don't need that trade-off.

03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:46.800
We could have a form of, imagine if Russia went to a system closer to social democracy

03:19:47.520 --> 03:19:52.960
that maintained the stability that people wanted, the welfare state that people wanted,

03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:59.600
but restructured the economy in not a shock way, but in a way that made sense and that ordinary

03:19:59.600 --> 03:20:03.760
people felt ownership of instead of just oligarchs who are a former Communist Party bureaucracy,

03:20:03.760 --> 03:20:09.840
just dividing up the country for themselves. I think the same thing in China. First of all,

03:20:09.840 --> 03:20:18.400
certainly from the West, the US government and people in the US should have no say over what

03:20:18.400 --> 03:20:25.200
should happen in China. The Chinese Communist Party has more authentic authority than any of us

03:20:25.200 --> 03:20:32.640
do in the country. But I think that the fears and stability that a lot of Chinese people have,

03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:40.240
why I would imagine that even in a democratic election, the Communist Party might have majority

03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:45.760
support is because they fear the unknown, they fear collapse. That was one of the big lessons of the

03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:54.640
Soviet collapse. Do you want China divided into five, six states? Do you want economic turmoil?

03:20:54.640 --> 03:20:59.840
Do you want mass immediate privatization? Do you want whatever welfare state you have

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:04.800
destroyed and so on? I think people are right to have those fears,

03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:10.800
but there's a different route towards democratization that maintains stability. There's

03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:17.600
different routes that you could have democracy. Not every country had to go

03:21:17.600 --> 03:21:21.760
down the route of Yugoslavia and the USSR and so on.

03:21:23.920 --> 03:21:32.000
You are the founder of the magazine Jacobin, of which I am a subscriber. I recommend everybody

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:38.720
subscribe whether you're on the left or the right. The magazine does tend to lean left.

03:21:38.720 --> 03:21:40.480
Does it officially say it's socialist?

03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:45.920
Yeah, we're a socialist publication. We try to be interesting, so we try to have articles that

03:21:45.920 --> 03:21:50.640
kind of have debates and contestation and whatever else, but we're definitely all socialists.

03:21:51.840 --> 03:21:56.640
Well, it's a lot of really interesting articles, so I definitely recommend that people subscribe,

03:21:56.640 --> 03:22:05.440
support. The product of the 21st century only subscribed to the digital version,

03:22:05.440 --> 03:22:07.120
but I guess there's also a paper version.

03:22:07.120 --> 03:22:10.000
Yeah, there's like 70,000 subscribers in print.

03:22:11.520 --> 03:22:14.880
Does it come on a scroll? I don't even know if it's a paper. Do they even publish paper?

03:22:15.760 --> 03:22:20.080
I'm going to mail you a bunch of copies. No, it's perfect bound. It's long issues.

03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:27.520
Jackman's publisher, Remake F4, just recently did a redesign of the publication, so it looks

03:22:27.520 --> 03:22:32.320
really good. It's up there in the design award competition range.

03:22:32.560 --> 03:22:37.040
Nice. It's sexy. I can show it off to all my friends. Look.

03:22:37.040 --> 03:22:39.120
Put it in your coffee table. You don't even have to read it.

03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:43.600
First, I need to get a coffee table, but yes, I'll get both. That's what a respectable adult... Listen,

03:22:43.600 --> 03:22:49.520
I've upgraded my life. I haven't had a couch, I don't think ever, so I got a couch recently

03:22:49.520 --> 03:22:55.040
because somebody told me that serious adults have a couch, and I also got a TV because serious adults

03:22:55.040 --> 03:22:59.920
have a couch and a TV, and as you see, it's been here for many months and I still haven't unboxed

03:22:59.920 --> 03:23:06.960
it. I'm trying to learn how to be an adult, looking up on YouTube how to be an adult and

03:23:06.960 --> 03:23:12.480
learning slowly. After that, I'll look into this whole leisure thing. Anyway, what's the origin of

03:23:12.480 --> 03:23:16.320
Jackman? What was the idea? What was the mission and what's the origin story?

03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:22.400
I started Jackman when I was between my sophomore and junior year of college. Basically, I was

03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:27.680
already a socialist. I was involved in the Democratic Socialist of America. I was in the

03:23:27.680 --> 03:23:33.600
youth section, the Young Democratic Socialists. I was editing their youth online magazine called

03:23:33.600 --> 03:23:40.320
The Activist back then. To be honest, I had my ideology, I had my views. I had a group of people

03:23:40.320 --> 03:23:45.280
around me that we would debate together and occasionally write for this other publication,

03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:53.120
The Activist and so on. Just a product of creative ignorance in the sense that I knew I had the

03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:57.520
capacity to maybe pull off an issue or two. I just had no idea how long I would keep doing it.

03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:04.320
I just eventually consumed my life slowly, maturely. I had different plans for my future,

03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:11.200
but I ended up just being a magazine publisher. I literally didn't know what a magazine publisher

03:24:11.200 --> 03:24:15.680
was, but it just kind of happened. What's the hardest part about running a magazine?

03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:22.080
The hardest part is obviously the things, just like any enterprise, the things beyond your

03:24:22.080 --> 03:24:28.400
control. You could put out something that you think is great or interesting, but then you need

03:24:28.400 --> 03:24:34.480
the feedback of people actually subscribing to it. You occasionally encounter periods where you feel

03:24:34.480 --> 03:24:39.760
like you're doing your best work, but you're not getting the audience response. I think you just

03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:49.680
need the self-confidence to just keep doing it. Obviously, if you're totally obscure and crazy

03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:55.200
and way off the mark, you're never going to build that audience, but I think a lot of publications

03:24:55.200 --> 03:25:02.400
have tried to adapt to what everyone else is doing right away when they don't achieve success.

03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:08.080
Whereas for me, the early issues of Jackman got very little resonance and took a while for it to

03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:12.720
build into something, but a lot of it was just the confidence to just keep going

03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:16.800
and keep publishing what I would want to read and just hope that I'm not so much of a weirdo

03:25:16.880 --> 03:25:24.000
that I'm the only one. Is there some pressure that you could speak to of audience capture?

03:25:24.640 --> 03:25:30.320
Because it is a socialist publication, you have a fan base, a readership base.

03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:35.840
Is there times you feel pressured not to say a certain thing, not to call out bullshit,

03:25:37.520 --> 03:25:41.360
not to criticize certain candidates, all that kind of stuff?

03:25:42.320 --> 03:25:49.120
Yes, definitely, of course. I myself am looser on the self-censorship than other people,

03:25:49.120 --> 03:25:56.320
but that's only because I've gotten this far just shooting from the hip or whatever.

03:25:56.320 --> 03:26:02.000
Occasionally, you'll come to a rash judgment. You'll speak too soon or complain about something

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:08.960
too soon and you'll have to either apologize or reconsider or whatever else. But on a host of

03:26:08.960 --> 03:26:15.920
issues, I have views that maybe not all of the left has, but I know that the core of my politics

03:26:15.920 --> 03:26:20.880
is a politics against oppression, against exploitation, against all the things that

03:26:20.880 --> 03:26:25.280
we talked about. If you know that's at the core of your politics, then you could maybe say,

03:26:26.160 --> 03:26:32.560
you know what, I don't think the left should respond to the real racism that's still around

03:26:32.560 --> 03:26:36.320
in the world by adopting an excessively racialized rhetoric, if that makes sense.

03:26:36.960 --> 03:26:42.800
I fundamentally just am a universalist and I believe that people, no matter where their

03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:48.480
backgrounds are and so on, want the same things for themselves and for their families.

03:26:50.560 --> 03:26:56.400
I feel like a lot of the left or some of the left, not even the far left, more like the center left,

03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:02.080
has adopted a stance saying, oh, we need to talk about white privilege or

03:27:02.800 --> 03:27:09.120
white Karens or white guys or old white guys doing this or whatever else. To me,

03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:14.080
it's not only wrong in a moral sense, but it's counterproductive because the last thing I want

03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:23.600
is a young white teenager who feels unrepresented politically and wants to be a part of maybe even

03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:30.560
the left to feel like, oh, I should think more about my identity. No, the whole point of anti-racist

03:27:30.560 --> 03:27:37.120
politics is that we want to live in a world where me and you can go around the corner and

03:27:37.120 --> 03:27:43.200
get a beer and we're not people of two different races getting a beer. We're just two guys in

03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:49.200
America getting a beer. We're trying to have the type of society in which there's less of that

03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:55.440
communal or racialized identity. That was the whole point of a whole generation of anti-racist

03:27:55.440 --> 03:28:03.680
struggle, but now we seem to be reifying it in the media and in culture and in politics.

03:28:04.320 --> 03:28:08.400
That's one issue where I've been banging the drum on this to the point that it's annoying

03:28:08.400 --> 03:28:14.080
in certain parts of the left. I don't think there's maybe extreme opposition among socialists,

03:28:14.080 --> 03:28:18.800
but it's more like a, why do you keep focusing on this? Let's focus on our real enemy,

03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:22.080
the right, instead of criticizing this part of-

03:28:22.080 --> 03:28:27.120
No, I think it's really, I am really glad you exist. I'm really glad you're beating that drum

03:28:27.120 --> 03:28:34.640
because I think that's one of the reasons that the left has not had a broader impact

03:28:35.440 --> 03:28:41.200
or is not heard by more people that could hear its message is because the othering.

03:28:41.680 --> 03:28:48.560
The othering of, as if there's two teams, as if it's black and white,

03:28:48.560 --> 03:28:52.320
as opposed to having there's a common humanity and a common struggle amongst all of us.

03:28:53.680 --> 03:28:59.040
You also wrote the book that we mentioned a few times, The Socialist Manifesto,

03:28:59.840 --> 03:29:04.240
The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequality. What's the framework?

03:29:04.240 --> 03:29:09.280
What are the key ideas of the book? A lot of it's a look at socialism's past,

03:29:09.360 --> 03:29:16.320
present, and future, basically. A lot of it is historical. The opening chapter uses a

03:29:17.200 --> 03:29:22.000
pasta sauce factory as a way to explain certain Marxist concepts, but also a theory of change,

03:29:22.000 --> 03:29:29.920
like how we get from, let's say, pure capitalism to more regulated, unionized and social democratic

03:29:29.920 --> 03:29:36.320
systems, and then beyond social democracy into my vision of socialism. That's the first little bit.

03:29:37.120 --> 03:29:44.720
It's a visionary look at the future of socialism, but then I try to explain why some of the past

03:29:44.720 --> 03:29:49.440
social movements have gone wrong because I think we can't take for granted. I think a lot of people

03:29:49.440 --> 03:29:54.480
want to live in a different or better society, but they look at past examples and they're skeptical,

03:29:54.480 --> 03:30:01.600
and I think there's good reason for skepticism. I try to explain both the successes of certain

03:30:01.600 --> 03:30:08.160
systems like social democracy, but also what happened in Russia, China, and more of a historical

03:30:08.160 --> 03:30:15.280
overview. Then the book ends in the present. It ends with looking at the Bernie Sanders campaign,

03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:22.080
why it resonated, looking at some of the problems facing the US, the UK, other advanced economies,

03:30:22.640 --> 03:30:29.200
and why I think the socialist message is still relevant. Because for the longest time,

03:30:29.840 --> 03:30:35.440
I'm 33, I became a socialist as a teenager. For the longest time, it seemed like I was just a

03:30:35.440 --> 03:30:40.960
member of a historical society, keeping alive an idea that nobody was interested in anymore.

03:30:40.960 --> 03:30:46.800
Now, it's heartening to see more young people interested in the idea, but we actually need to,

03:30:47.520 --> 03:30:54.480
I think, have a clearer sense of what we stand for and how we make our movement, like it used to be,

03:30:54.480 --> 03:30:59.920
more rooted in the working class. If anyone rewinds the tape, they go to when we first

03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:05.520
started talking about early socialism, when I was talking about the German social democratic

03:31:05.520 --> 03:31:12.160
workers movement or all these different early parties. I think at various points, I use the

03:31:12.160 --> 03:31:18.960
word worker and socialist movement interchangeably, because in fact, at the time, it was pretty

03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:25.600
interchangeable. Socialism was the ideology that had the appeal of the working class movement.

03:31:27.120 --> 03:31:32.800
You couldn't really separate between the two. Now, obviously, socialism is like a fringe

03:31:32.800 --> 03:31:38.400
ideological concurrent among a very small minority of the working class, which is fine,

03:31:38.400 --> 03:31:43.680
but we need to get to the point, I think, ideally, where when people talk about unions and people

03:31:43.680 --> 03:31:49.040
protesting and social movements and socialism, they all kind of are one in the same as part of

03:31:49.040 --> 03:31:55.120
the same broad movement. How did you become a socialist? What was the personal story or the

03:31:55.120 --> 03:32:00.400
idea that took hold in your mind? I'm the youngest of five. I was only one of my family born in the

03:32:00.400 --> 03:32:06.960
United States. It was very obvious to me that my life outcomes were very different than life outcomes

03:32:06.960 --> 03:32:13.440
of my siblings. My three older siblings didn't go to college after high school,

03:32:13.440 --> 03:32:21.760
some of them got their degrees much later on as adults, but I was from a pretty young age,

03:32:21.760 --> 03:32:27.760
had access to a great public school district, and was put on the track that you're going to go to

03:32:27.760 --> 03:32:33.680
college. This is kind of the outcome. Like I said, even my grandmother was illiterate.

03:32:34.960 --> 03:32:41.920
My mom didn't have a lot of educational opportunities early in her life. She actually

03:32:41.920 --> 03:32:48.000
graduated from college the same year I did, so she later got her degrees and whatever else.

03:32:50.320 --> 03:32:55.440
But to me, it was obvious that so much of my life outcomes weren't just a product of hard work

03:32:55.440 --> 03:33:03.440
or my family sacrifices, because of course, I had the same family as my siblings, but the product

03:33:03.440 --> 03:33:08.960
of state institutions helping out, evening things out, public school district, public library,

03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:15.200
all sorts of after school programs, all that was the domain of the state, and I really benefited

03:33:15.200 --> 03:33:22.880
from it. So in essence, my core was the social democratic belief, the state should redistribute

03:33:22.880 --> 03:33:28.480
a bit, build public institutions, be an equalizer. Now how I became a Marxist and a socialist was

03:33:28.480 --> 03:33:32.880
much more random. I was just intellectually interested in it, and eventually I merged the

03:33:32.880 --> 03:33:40.320
two together, where I merged together my more pragmatic and practical interest in day-to-day

03:33:40.320 --> 03:33:46.800
concerns and reforms and so on, with my loftier intellectual interest in Marxism into the politics

03:33:46.800 --> 03:33:53.440
I have today, which I try to balance and do both. I think a lot of socialists in the organization

03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:58.720
that I joined as a teenager, the Democratic Socialists of America and elsewhere, try to do

03:33:58.720 --> 03:34:04.640
the two, try to maintain some sort of balance between here and our vision of the future.

03:34:04.640 --> 03:34:07.680
What do you think Marx would say if he were to read your book,

03:34:08.400 --> 03:34:10.320
Socialist Manifest and do a review?

03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:17.920
So I think Marx would say that my vision of a socialism after capitalism

03:34:19.600 --> 03:34:26.640
maintains key elements of what he would, the commodity form. So a lot of what Marx was

03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:34.720
concerned about was what markets do to human relationships in a negative sense. His early

03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:42.160
writings especially focus a lot on the alienation of labor. My vision of socialism, at least in the

03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:47.760
near term, a lot of that is about decommodifying certain sectors, so reducing the market in certain

03:34:47.760 --> 03:34:53.280
sectors and reducing alienation, but not eliminating it. It is about eliminating

03:34:53.280 --> 03:35:00.000
exploitation and oppression. So knowing Marx and knowing how critical he was of certain other

03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:04.480
socialist strands and tendencies, and he would often write very snarky notes and letters to

03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:10.960
people like Engels being like, this guy, LaSalle, he's a total asshole. Then he would send a separate

03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:16.080
note to LaSalle saying, hey, can I borrow five grand? This is actually true. He did the both,

03:35:16.080 --> 03:35:21.440
I think, the same month. So he would be really good at Twitter is what you say.

03:35:21.760 --> 03:35:26.400
He would be the best at Twitter. Also, he was a journalist before with his work for the New

03:35:26.400 --> 03:35:33.600
York Tribune. He was very clever, very snarky. He would be awesome at Twitter. I think him and Elon

03:35:33.600 --> 03:35:37.760
would have good back and forwards. I think it would be critical in some parts, but I think that

03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:44.080
the strangest part for him would be reading the historical sections and seeing the way in which

03:35:44.800 --> 03:35:48.160
his ideas, which was fundamentally ideas about human emancipation,

03:35:50.400 --> 03:35:56.480
were used for evil, for hardship in ways that did the opposite of emancipated,

03:35:56.480 --> 03:36:01.680
but in some cases enslaved people. I think he would have definitely not want to be associated

03:36:01.680 --> 03:36:08.000
with them. He probably would rather be associated with me than them, but even then only begrudgingly.

03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:14.800
What advice would you give to young folks

03:36:16.960 --> 03:36:22.960
in high school, in college, how to have a career they can be proud of or how to change the world?

03:36:23.600 --> 03:36:31.280
I think be intellectually curious. Read outside your current beliefs and understand and read

03:36:31.280 --> 03:36:36.160
authors on their own terms. So the worst thing in the world to do is to read anything, especially

03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:43.040
work of fiction, but anything and try to deduce the author's backgrounds or politics, whatever

03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:48.800
else. Read it on its own terms first. Then you could reread it and do other examinations or

03:36:48.800 --> 03:36:54.880
whatever else. And also read a lot of history. So I started off reading books like Eric Hoppe's

03:36:54.880 --> 03:37:04.640
Bombs, four books on history going from the 1700s all the way to 1994. The last book is Age of

03:37:04.640 --> 03:37:11.280
Extremes, but I think understanding history gives you a bird's eye view of everything. Sociology,

03:37:12.720 --> 03:37:18.800
economics, everything. So these big sweeping historical books are really useful to know.

03:37:18.800 --> 03:37:25.760
Everybody should know basically what decade serfdom was abolished, what decade

03:37:26.320 --> 03:37:32.080
slavery was abolished, what century Magna Carta was, when the Roman Empire fell, even though

03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:38.240
that's kind of debated when the Roman Empire fell. I think being a person with a general

03:37:38.240 --> 03:37:41.840
knowledge and general sense of history and whatever else just makes you more eclectic

03:37:41.840 --> 03:37:46.240
and interesting. And it's way better than just, especially a lot of my Indian friends,

03:37:47.600 --> 03:37:52.480
not just Indians, but the hyper focus on you got to specialize and you have to focus on

03:37:53.200 --> 03:37:56.640
math or engineering, whatever you want to do. You just know your field really well,

03:37:56.640 --> 03:38:01.040
but nothing else. I think there's something really too, whether you're getting at school

03:38:01.040 --> 03:38:04.960
or you're just going to do it by yourself, giving yourself kind of a liberal arts education.

03:38:05.840 --> 03:38:10.080
I think there's a lot of power to sort of having the facts of history in terms of in time when

03:38:10.080 --> 03:38:15.040
stuff happened, but also really powerful is knowing spatially, like the geography,

03:38:16.560 --> 03:38:21.200
there were a point on a map and there's interesting dynamics that happen throughout history

03:38:21.200 --> 03:38:25.520
of all the different nations in Europe, of all the different military conflicts and the expansions

03:38:26.240 --> 03:38:32.400
and the wars and the empires and all that kind of stuff. It really puts into context how

03:38:34.080 --> 03:38:38.880
human history has led to the place we are today because all the different geopolitical conflicts

03:38:38.880 --> 03:38:43.920
we have today, even the politics of the day is grounded in history. Maybe less so for the United

03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:48.240
States because it has a very young history, but that history, even from the United States,

03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:55.440
is still there from the civil war. And understanding that gives you context to when you tweet random

03:38:55.440 --> 03:39:05.040
stuff about this or that person or politician and so on. Yeah, very true. Very true. One of

03:39:05.040 --> 03:39:11.120
the regrets I have currently is I have perhaps been too focused on the 20th century in terms

03:39:11.120 --> 03:39:18.160
of history, the present and the 20th century. A lot of people write to me that there's a lot

03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:22.800
of lessons to be learned in ancient history as well. So not just even American history,

03:39:22.800 --> 03:39:30.560
but just looking farther and farther and farther back. Yeah, that feels like it's another time.

03:39:30.560 --> 03:39:35.120
It's another place. It totally has no lessons, but then you remind yourself that it's the same

03:39:35.120 --> 03:39:39.840
human beings, right? Yeah, and also we're no smarter than them. We just have more crude knowledge in

03:39:39.840 --> 03:39:47.440
part because of them, but they were just as clever as us. What do you think is the meaning of this

03:39:47.440 --> 03:39:51.680
whole experiment we have going on on Earth? Now, what's the meaning of life?

03:39:52.880 --> 03:39:59.040
Well, I think there's no broad meaning of life. It was an accident, but we ourselves need to make

03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:06.400
our own meaning. And for me, a lot of it is about posterity, trying to do something worthwhile

03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:12.960
while on Earth, but also leaving something behind. It could just be relationships with friends or

03:40:12.960 --> 03:40:18.960
family in the future, maybe having a family and then leaving behind that legacy,

03:40:19.760 --> 03:40:25.520
the little bits of yourself, but also them being able to learn the same way I have little bits of

03:40:25.520 --> 03:40:32.640
my parents and my grandparents in me. And then also I think in a social sense, zooming out from

03:40:32.640 --> 03:40:41.520
just the individual and the family, leaving the world behind a little better. I would love to

03:40:42.480 --> 03:40:47.520
be a part of a movement that created a world with a little bit less suffering, a little bit less

03:40:47.520 --> 03:40:54.640
oppression or exploitation or whatever else. That's really why I'm a socialist. It's not about

03:40:55.280 --> 03:41:00.880
snapping your fingers and curing the world of everything in one go, but it is about, I think,

03:41:02.720 --> 03:41:06.640
giving our lives some sort of meaning and purpose. And you don't have to be a socialist to do that.

03:41:06.640 --> 03:41:13.920
You could just do it at the micro level in your own day-to-day interactions. But I just feel like

03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:21.680
life has no good meaning without thinking of posterity in the future. And I have to say,

03:41:21.680 --> 03:41:27.040
thank you for doing so. Thank you for caring about the struggle of the people in the world

03:41:27.040 --> 03:41:33.680
through ideas that are bold and I think challenging for a lot of people in a time when

03:41:33.680 --> 03:41:39.440
socialism is something that can be attacked aggressively by large numbers of people

03:41:39.440 --> 03:41:45.120
still persevering and still exploring those ideas and seeing what of those ideas can make

03:41:45.120 --> 03:41:48.960
for a better world. That's beautiful to see. Bosco, thank you so much for talking today.

03:41:48.960 --> 03:41:52.240
Thank you for all the work you do. I can't wait to see what you do next.

03:41:52.240 --> 03:41:56.240
I appreciate it. And yeah, thanks for keeping an open mind with these conversations and to

03:41:56.240 --> 03:42:03.040
your audience too. It's nice to have a space where people can debate and think at length and

03:42:03.040 --> 03:42:05.760
don't have to worry about soundbite culture. Thank you, brother.

03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:11.360
Thank you for listening to this conversation with Bhaskara Sankara. To support this podcast,

03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:16.160
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:42:16.160 --> 03:42:24.800
Karl Marx. Democracy is the road to socialism. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next

03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:26.560
time.
