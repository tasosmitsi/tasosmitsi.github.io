00:00.000 --> 00:01.660
I mean, I've definitely experienced moments

00:01.660 --> 00:05.460
where I didn't want to do anything but chess.

00:05.460 --> 00:07.040
I also say that's pretty universal.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.400
I think if you want to be the best at anything you do

00:09.400 --> 00:12.000
or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.160
The following is a conversation

00:15.160 --> 00:17.480
with Alexandra and Andrea Botas.

00:17.480 --> 00:20.100
They're sisters, professional chess players,

00:20.100 --> 00:23.900
commentators, educators, entertainers, and streamers.

00:23.900 --> 00:28.120
Their channel is called Botas Live on Twitch and YouTube.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.920
I highly recommend you check it out.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.640
A small side note about the currently ongoing controversy

00:33.640 --> 00:36.560
in the chess world, where the 19-year-old Grandmaster

00:36.560 --> 00:40.940
Hans Nieman beat Magnus Carlsen at the Sinkfield Cup.

00:40.940 --> 00:43.960
After this, Magnus, for the first time ever,

00:43.960 --> 00:46.720
withdrew from the tournament, implying with a tweet

00:46.720 --> 00:48.380
that there may have been cheating

00:48.380 --> 00:50.840
or at least something shady going on.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.580
Folks like the Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura

00:53.580 --> 00:56.120
fanned the flames of cheating accusations,

00:56.160 --> 00:59.320
and the internet made a bunch of proposals

00:59.320 --> 01:01.400
on how the cheating could have been done

01:01.400 --> 01:05.040
and it ranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious,

01:05.040 --> 01:05.960
often both.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.520
Hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before

01:10.520 --> 01:14.480
when he was 12 and 16 on random online games

01:14.480 --> 01:16.400
to jack up his rating.

01:16.400 --> 01:19.280
But he said that he has never cheated

01:19.280 --> 01:21.240
in person over the board.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.240
Danny Wrench from Chess.com, who I've spoken with,

01:24.280 --> 01:27.700
may make a statement in response to Hans's claims soon.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.840
Folks like Grandmaster Jakob Luga

01:30.840 --> 01:32.960
spoke to his experience training Hans Nieman

01:32.960 --> 01:36.280
and has said that his memory and intuition

01:36.280 --> 01:38.080
were quite brilliant.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.540
So as you see, there's a lot of perspectives on this.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.720
ChessBase has a good summary of the saga

01:42.720 --> 01:45.160
that I'll link in the description.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.040
Also note that this is so quickly moving

01:48.040 --> 01:50.660
that new stuff might come out between me recording this

01:50.660 --> 01:52.360
and publishing the episode.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.760
But I thought I'd mention this anyway

01:53.760 --> 01:56.400
since the episode with the Boatat Sisters

01:56.400 --> 01:58.400
is a conversation about chess

01:58.400 --> 02:01.240
and was recorded shortly before the controversy,

02:01.240 --> 02:02.700
so we didn't talk about it.

02:03.740 --> 02:06.960
I'm considering having Hans on this podcast

02:06.960 --> 02:09.360
and also Magnus back on the podcast

02:09.360 --> 02:11.480
and maybe others like Hikaru

02:11.480 --> 02:14.920
or folks from Chess.com's anti-cheat staff

02:14.920 --> 02:16.480
to discuss their really interesting

02:16.480 --> 02:18.680
cheating detection algorithms.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.840
But I may also just stay out of it.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.120
I find chess to be a beautiful game

02:24.120 --> 02:25.480
and the chess community

02:25.480 --> 02:28.080
full of fascinating, brilliant people.

02:28.080 --> 02:30.360
And so I'll keep having conversations like these

02:30.360 --> 02:32.840
about chess, it's fun.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.960
My goal with this podcast and in general as a human being

02:36.960 --> 02:40.040
is to increase the amount of love in the world.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.080
Sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty

02:43.080 --> 02:46.320
in science, in art, in chess.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.680
Sometimes it involves empathetic conversations

02:48.680 --> 02:52.160
with controversial figures that seek to understand,

02:52.160 --> 02:53.920
not to ride.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.160
Sometimes it involves standing against

02:56.160 --> 03:00.160
the internet lynch mob as the chess base article calls it

03:00.160 --> 03:03.960
to hear the story of a human being who is under attack,

03:03.960 --> 03:08.040
even if it means I get attacked in the process as well.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.960
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.460
To support it, please check out our sponsors

03:12.460 --> 03:13.600
in the description.

03:13.600 --> 03:18.040
And now, dear friends, here's Alexandra and Andrea Botes.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.880
You just got back from Italy.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.600
What's the most memorable thing?

03:22.600 --> 03:24.040
I was just there recently as well.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.960
It was very chaotic because we went out on a whim

03:27.960 --> 03:30.880
and we only had our first hotel booked

03:30.880 --> 03:33.880
and then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities

03:33.880 --> 03:35.560
and went to like five different cities

03:35.560 --> 03:37.640
in about a week and a bit.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.320
So I think it was just the variety

03:39.320 --> 03:40.800
of seeing so many different places

03:40.800 --> 03:42.640
when we're used to being at home all the time.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.320
And Andrea, is yours your luggage?

03:45.320 --> 03:48.040
Yeah, I would say it was the most stressful vacation

03:48.040 --> 03:49.560
we've been in in our life.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.560
And it was a valuable learning lesson

03:51.560 --> 03:54.760
because now I know how to be prepared for trips.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.600
But we lost our bags and I never got them back.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.680
And like Alex said,

03:58.680 --> 04:00.560
we didn't know where we'd be sleeping every night

04:00.560 --> 04:02.940
and we're just driving through a new city

04:02.940 --> 04:06.000
with a giant van in the most narrowest streets

04:06.000 --> 04:09.400
and getting in many, many fights with Italian men.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.840
So it wasn't really a vacation.

04:10.840 --> 04:13.080
I saw this motion so many times.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.540
Wasn't it liberating to lose your baggage?

04:16.540 --> 04:17.700
Is it like still the lining?

04:18.340 --> 04:19.180
It was liberating.

04:19.180 --> 04:21.820
My entire life, I've always had the issue of overpacking.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.380
And I told her before the trip,

04:23.380 --> 04:25.200
Andrea, you're gonna pack light, right?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.040
Yeah, Alex, yeah.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.180
And then I see her stuffing her overweight suitcase.

04:28.180 --> 04:29.300
But you did the same.

04:29.300 --> 04:33.460
We both had giant big extra baggage that we didn't need.

04:33.460 --> 04:36.980
And I'm actually very glad we lost it for Venice,

04:36.980 --> 04:38.560
hauling that around on all the boats

04:38.560 --> 04:41.140
and through the tiny streets and there's no Ubers.

04:41.140 --> 04:43.500
And now it's the first time where I can travel

04:43.500 --> 04:46.480
without checking in a bag, which I've never done before.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.040
So now I've learned what it means to pack light

04:48.040 --> 04:50.920
because I saw that I could survive off of just my,

04:50.920 --> 04:51.980
it sounds very dramatic,

04:51.980 --> 04:54.400
but it was really a big learning lesson for me.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.760
The driving must've been crazy

04:55.760 --> 04:57.920
because driving in Italy is rough.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.560
The driving was crazy.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.840
I did most of it and it would be really interesting

05:03.840 --> 05:06.200
driving through places like Florence

05:06.200 --> 05:10.140
or even through the beach areas that were super windy

05:10.140 --> 05:11.560
because there are two-way streets

05:11.560 --> 05:13.280
that should really only be one way.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.160
So you'd be driving this huge van

05:15.200 --> 05:17.400
and then another car comes on a cliff

05:17.400 --> 05:19.440
and you're just waiting for it to slowly pass.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.960
So it took all of my focus and concentration

05:22.960 --> 05:24.360
to drive well in Italy.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.960
But it was actually really relaxing

05:25.960 --> 05:30.000
because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos

05:30.000 --> 05:32.120
online is you're always thinking about it,

05:32.120 --> 05:33.360
what's coming next.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.000
And when we were in Italy, it was so chaotic

05:36.000 --> 05:39.240
that I did not think about work for a good week and a bit.

05:39.240 --> 05:40.400
Oh, because you're just.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.240
We were stressed.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.720
I was just trying to keep us alive.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.520
It seemed like a priority.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.680
And that was kind of fun.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.880
It was kind of fun.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.280
No planning, nothing.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.440
I wouldn't recommend it or ever do that again, but.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.480
It sounds pretty awesome.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.120
And we even randomly ran into two friends of ours

05:57.120 --> 05:58.280
who were in the same city

05:58.280 --> 06:01.120
and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.320
Yeah, so you just took on the chaos.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.960
Exactly, it was an adventure.

06:04.960 --> 06:05.800
Okay, and I see like,

06:05.800 --> 06:07.040
because you were using your hands a lot,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.800
you picked up some of the Italian hand gestures.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.720
I did.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.120
We did get yelled at by a lot of Italians.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.320
The old Italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast

06:17.320 --> 06:18.880
because we'd leave something on the plate

06:18.880 --> 06:19.720
and she'd be like,

06:19.720 --> 06:21.720
you could feed an entire village with that.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.280
Tell your friends and we'd be, we'd feel so ashamed.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.800
Yeah, we got cursed out a lot,

06:25.800 --> 06:28.960
but it really reminded me of where we grew up and helped.

06:28.960 --> 06:29.800
That's true.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.640
Yeah, bring back those.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.320
Where'd you grow up?

06:32.320 --> 06:35.360
We're Romanian, but it was like an immigrant neighborhood.

06:35.360 --> 06:36.360
In camp.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.280
So, same, if you don't finish your plate,

06:39.280 --> 06:42.000
that's disrespectful to the people who made the food.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.600
How was the food in Italy?

06:43.640 --> 06:46.080
I feel like the carbs thing is too intense.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.320
Yeah, I think very overrated in my opinion.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.080
So I'm actually not supposed to eat gluten

06:51.080 --> 06:52.680
because I have an allergy,

06:52.680 --> 06:56.280
but I was in Italy and it's gluten galore.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.840
So I was actually eating a lot of it

06:57.840 --> 06:58.840
and it was very interesting

06:58.840 --> 07:00.840
because I didn't get sick while I was in Italy,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.080
but I do while I'm in the US.

07:03.080 --> 07:08.080
So somehow the food was actually maybe more okay

07:08.080 --> 07:09.760
for me to digest, which I appreciated,

07:09.760 --> 07:11.680
but I didn't like it as much as I thought.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.800
Did you like the food there?

07:12.960 --> 07:16.960
Yeah, no, I did, I did.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.960
I love carbs, but it feels like Vegas,

07:21.960 --> 07:24.800
when I go there for the food is like,

07:24.800 --> 07:28.400
if I stay here too long, I'm gonna do things I regret.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.160
That's what it feels like with the food

07:30.160 --> 07:31.200
because I don't know how to moderate

07:31.200 --> 07:33.920
and everybody is pushing very large portions

07:33.920 --> 07:37.040
and wild kind of eating things on you.

07:37.040 --> 07:41.720
Pasta, pizza, and bread, so delicious.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.520
So yeah, I love it, but I regret everything.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.880
So it's like, I don't wanna go to a place

07:47.880 --> 07:51.560
where I'm going to regret everything I do

07:51.560 --> 07:54.480
for too long of a time.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.280
Yeah, surprisingly the people there though

07:56.280 --> 07:59.120
are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape,

07:59.120 --> 08:00.960
but that's probably because you're walking around all day

08:00.960 --> 08:02.400
and you're much more active than in the US.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.560
And they also just know how to moderate food.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.360
I think I got used to the US way of eating.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.200
The US portions.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.080
What is that?

08:09.080 --> 08:14.080
Just a lot, always a lot and more.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.640
And I feel in the US food advertisements

08:17.640 --> 08:19.400
are also much more in your face

08:19.400 --> 08:21.560
and you're more often reminded of junk food

08:21.560 --> 08:22.960
than we were in Italy.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.560
So even though you're eating less healthy things,

08:25.560 --> 08:27.360
I think we were getting cravings

08:27.360 --> 08:29.680
and being pushed towards junk food less often.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.200
All right, I gotta ask you a hard question.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.960
So the romance languages.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.680
So I think French is up there as like number one.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.040
I don't know.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.520
Who's ranking them?

08:42.520 --> 08:45.320
Oh, you guys speak Italian or no?

08:45.320 --> 08:49.280
Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.120
And Romanian.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.360
I feel like every country calls it a language,

08:52.360 --> 08:53.200
a romance language.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.840
No, but it's Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.960
And I think there was one more that was like this dialect,

09:00.960 --> 09:03.400
but those are considered the romance languages.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.480
Okay, so where would you put Italian?

09:05.480 --> 09:08.280
I think we got yelled at so much in Italian

09:08.800 --> 09:10.760
that it's not gonna be a lot of room.

09:10.760 --> 09:11.600
So it wasn't working.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.000
It's on the bottom of the list

09:13.000 --> 09:15.040
because people did not use it nicely to us.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.280
But I always really liked how French sounds.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.040
I think something about it where maybe Spanish

09:23.040 --> 09:25.000
actually sounds nicer to the ears,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
but French has more character and it feels more sultry.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.080
So I like French.

09:29.080 --> 09:29.920
What about you, Andrea?

09:29.920 --> 09:31.160
Yeah, that was my answer too.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.520
Sultry, okay.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.000
I feel like French in France,

09:37.040 --> 09:39.320
I feel like I'm always being judged.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.720
Like they're better than me.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.560
That's what French is.

09:41.560 --> 09:42.400
They are better than us.

09:42.400 --> 09:47.400
That's so true, which is why I long to belong to that.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.920
I like the British accent.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.120
The British accent. Really?

09:53.120 --> 09:53.960
Yeah.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.920
Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip

09:55.920 --> 09:58.360
is we just picked up British accents

09:58.360 --> 10:00.560
for the entire trip for fun.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.040
And we forgot we were doing them

10:02.040 --> 10:03.840
to the point where we talked to British people

10:03.840 --> 10:05.920
and they'd ask us, why are you talking like that?

10:06.120 --> 10:07.360
I just couldn't stop.

10:07.360 --> 10:11.000
I did feel much more elegant and mature.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.120
People, I don't know if they felt the same way about us,

10:14.120 --> 10:16.600
but it was more of the confidence.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.280
You do feel like you're more poised for sure.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.320
So how'd you guys get into chess?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.200
When did you first,

10:24.200 --> 10:26.840
let's say when did you first fall in love with chess?

10:28.280 --> 10:31.000
So we both started playing when we were pretty young,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.120
around six years old.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.800
That's when our dad taught us.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.200
And I enjoyed playing chess

10:36.200 --> 10:38.720
because I had good results early on,

10:38.720 --> 10:42.000
but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.320
And I only really started loving it

10:44.320 --> 10:47.320
when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.400
And chess was the one stable thing that I had.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.800
And it was also where all of my friends were.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.520
So it was kind of that foundational thing for me.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.640
And that's when I started studying chess very intensely.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.240
And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will,

11:02.240 --> 11:04.040
not because I was being pushed by my dad,

11:04.040 --> 11:05.720
that's when I started really loving it.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.600
And I even wanted to take time off college

11:07.600 --> 11:09.400
to just focus on chess.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.440
So training and competing?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.960
Training and competing, yeah.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.120
It was when I was doing it for myself

11:15.120 --> 11:17.480
that I started getting my best results.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.560
And actually enjoying the thing.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.200
And really enjoying it, yeah.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.920
I would spend summer vacation studying for tournaments

11:23.920 --> 11:25.480
and my mom would come and say,

11:25.480 --> 11:27.760
you need to make friends, go leave the house.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.880
And I'd be like, no, I need to play chess.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.800
And I remember those moments.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.160
That you rebelled by playing chess.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.360
That's awesome. Yeah, exactly.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.560
How did you get into it?

11:36.560 --> 11:39.680
Yeah, my experience with loving in high school

11:39.680 --> 11:41.440
is very opposite from Alex's.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.160
But right, my sister was playing

11:43.160 --> 11:44.560
and my dad taught me when I was also six.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.360
Andrea was cool in high school, unlike me.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.200
You were.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.640
I wouldn't say cool.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.800
I'd say more balanced and I was interested in other hobbies.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.760
In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess,

11:54.760 --> 11:56.880
there's certainly moments about like traveling

11:56.880 --> 11:58.320
and being together with my family

11:58.320 --> 11:59.680
and spending those moments together.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.720
But those were more the social and the experiences.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.440
But funny enough, I think my happiest moment

12:05.440 --> 12:08.040
where I really played the game for my own enjoyment

12:08.040 --> 12:11.480
was probably my most recent tournament.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.040
Because this was after, obviously, we've been streaming

12:15.040 --> 12:16.040
and I'm no longer in high school.

12:16.040 --> 12:20.040
But when I was in school, I was always playing for college

12:20.040 --> 12:22.200
and for the results, trying to build a resume.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.040
So I was too stressed out about the pressure

12:24.040 --> 12:25.360
to really enjoy the game.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.360
Whereas when I just played my first tournament,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.240
so it was like after like a two year break

12:30.240 --> 12:31.720
because of the pandemic.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.440
And it was also all live on Twitch.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.320
So there was some pressure,

12:35.320 --> 12:38.880
but it was the first time that I was really eager

12:38.880 --> 12:40.920
to study for the game, sitting and focusing

12:40.920 --> 12:42.120
since we've been streaming

12:42.120 --> 12:45.320
and not getting distracted by something else in years,

12:45.320 --> 12:46.200
like I said.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.520
And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating

12:48.520 --> 12:50.320
and it was my best tournament ever.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.400
And I think most of that is

12:51.400 --> 12:54.040
because it came from my own enjoyment.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.520
So you didn't enjoy the domination.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.880
I think you did really well, right?

12:58.880 --> 13:00.400
This was like a couple months ago?

13:00.400 --> 13:01.360
Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.440
Well, of course, I think the results came

13:03.440 --> 13:04.920
from enjoying the tournament.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.920
Because I would be in high school studying

13:07.920 --> 13:09.800
triple the amount of time, like six hours every day

13:09.800 --> 13:10.760
compared to this tournament.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.040
I didn't even prepare for it.

13:12.040 --> 13:15.120
And for three years, I wouldn't be able to pass one rating.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.880
Whereas in this one tournament, I passed it by like 70 points

13:17.880 --> 13:19.720
without even any preparation.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.440
So it was, I think, as soon as you stop worrying

13:22.440 --> 13:24.880
about the competitions, when the games get much better.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.520
What does it mean to pass a rating?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.320
So I was stuck at 1900.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.120
1900 is a hundred points off of expert.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.000
Yeah.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.800
Usually when you reach 2000, you're considered an expert,

13:34.800 --> 13:36.760
which is the rating Andrea was going for.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.240
Okay, expert, that's a technical term,

13:39.240 --> 13:40.840
or that's like talking trash?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.520
It's more of a colloquial term

13:42.520 --> 13:44.320
where if somebody's around a 2000

13:44.320 --> 13:45.600
and you're playing them in a tournament,

13:45.600 --> 13:47.680
they won't have the actual title next to their name,

13:47.680 --> 13:49.480
but you always say, I'm playing an expert.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.800
What about the more official things like master?

13:52.800 --> 13:53.960
Does that have to do with the rating or something else?

13:53.960 --> 13:57.920
Yeah, so national master in the U.S. is when you're 2200.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.840
Okay, and what's international master?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.680
International master is based off of a different system,

14:02.680 --> 14:05.000
the FIDE system, which is international.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.440
To be an international master, it's 2400

14:09.440 --> 14:12.520
and you have to have three international master norms.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.520
Yeah, I think Magnus said he's a 28, six something.

14:16.520 --> 14:17.360
That was, yeah.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.920
And then he said, that's pretty decent.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.760
Well, he always talks about it like that.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.480
The thing is, I think what he meant is

14:24.480 --> 14:25.760
that's a decent rating

14:25.760 --> 14:29.120
because it accurately captures his actual level.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.040
So it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.840
And so the discussion there was how do you get to,

14:35.840 --> 14:38.440
can a human being get to 2900?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.440
And then he says, because my current rating

14:40.440 --> 14:43.600
is pretty decent at representing my skill level,

14:43.600 --> 14:46.360
it's gonna be a long road to actually get there.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.520
Because it's like, so you have to beat people

14:48.520 --> 14:50.600
your same level, that's how the number increases.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.320
Exactly, yeah.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.520
And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?

14:54.520 --> 14:55.840
That are higher than your luck.

14:55.840 --> 14:56.680
I got very lucky.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.120
Oh, I was playing, I was really nervous

14:58.120 --> 15:01.720
because my category was like 200 points above my rating.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.080
And of course I was very rusty

15:04.080 --> 15:05.560
and I hadn't played a tournament in a while,

15:05.560 --> 15:07.720
but it went pretty well.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.360
Do you feel the pressure when you're actually recording it,

15:10.360 --> 15:11.640
like the streaming?

15:11.640 --> 15:15.640
It was definitely, so before every round I was vlogging

15:15.640 --> 15:17.240
and I was doing meet and greets

15:17.240 --> 15:19.080
and doing other things for the live.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.040
I thought you'd do a meet and greet.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.320
You didn't know what the hell you were doing, it's great.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.160
Yeah.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.240
Like, how do I do this?

15:25.240 --> 15:26.480
Yeah, I see.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.520
What do I do?

15:27.520 --> 15:29.120
It was actually really wholesome.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.840
The beginning was very silly

15:31.840 --> 15:33.600
because I was just not expecting

15:33.600 --> 15:35.240
that it was gonna be more of a seminar.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.560
I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.480
But they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions,

15:39.480 --> 15:41.520
but unfortunately it's bad for YouTube retention

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
and we cut them all out, so.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.360
Bad for YouTube?

15:44.360 --> 15:45.200
Yeah.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
The good long form conversation.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.360
So it was like questions, Q and A type of thing.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.480
Exactly, you have to have very fast paced for YouTube

15:51.480 --> 15:54.160
and that seminar was not fast paced.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.840
Okay, well not everything in life

15:55.840 --> 15:57.160
needs to be on YouTube, right?

15:57.160 --> 15:58.000
That's true.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
There's like two parallel things,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.440
stuff that's fun for YouTube.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.400
Yes, one day we'll post that Q and A.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.480
Yeah, when you guys like, when you become like ultra famous,

16:06.480 --> 16:08.240
you're currently just regular famous.

16:08.240 --> 16:12.680
And then they'll appreciate the long, slow content, yes.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.480
And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect,

16:15.480 --> 16:17.960
does that add to the fun, ultimately?

16:18.600 --> 16:20.160
How's the chess, of like your love of chess?

16:20.160 --> 16:21.640
Oh, for the love of chess in general

16:21.640 --> 16:24.320
or just for competing in that one tournament?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.400
No, love of chess in general.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.040
I think you said that for competing for that tournament

16:28.040 --> 16:29.000
was adding pressure.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.600
Yeah, but actually I would say like a good pressure,

16:31.600 --> 16:34.000
but yeah, this is where I differed to Alex

16:34.000 --> 16:37.880
because when I was just competitive and I was younger,

16:37.880 --> 16:39.360
I don't think I loved chess as much

16:39.360 --> 16:41.080
as when I started doing it for content

16:41.080 --> 16:43.440
because unlike her, who a lot of her friends

16:43.440 --> 16:46.320
and social circle other chess players,

16:46.360 --> 16:49.120
I never really traveled and built really solid friendships

16:49.120 --> 16:51.400
through chess until I started streaming

16:51.400 --> 16:52.880
and meeting other chess streamers

16:52.880 --> 16:55.960
and actually playing and talking to people for fun

16:55.960 --> 16:58.240
rather than just always being alone in the game

16:58.240 --> 17:00.560
and never really meeting other people my age

17:00.560 --> 17:02.160
or people with similar interests.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.240
So I would say Twitch was the thing

17:04.240 --> 17:07.360
that really changed how I approached the game.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.240
I think with some YouTubers,

17:09.240 --> 17:11.440
there's a pressure to be almost somebody else.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.320
You create a persona and you're stuck in that persona.

17:14.360 --> 17:19.160
I think I'm too much of a boomer

17:19.160 --> 17:20.680
to know what the hell Twitch is anyway,

17:20.680 --> 17:23.880
but it feels like when you're actually live streaming,

17:23.880 --> 17:26.200
you can't help but be who you really are.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.920
I think it's, oh, well, I think when you're live streaming

17:28.920 --> 17:31.360
and I've talked to a lot of other streamers about this,

17:31.360 --> 17:33.840
you kind of just over-exaggerate one side

17:33.840 --> 17:35.840
of your personality and of course,

17:35.840 --> 17:37.720
it's kind of like being like on all the time.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.360
Like you're trying to be more entertaining

17:39.360 --> 17:42.320
and sometimes you're being sillier at moments

17:42.320 --> 17:45.760
or more, you take what character traits

17:45.760 --> 17:46.920
like people know you for.

17:46.920 --> 17:48.800
And for me, one is being like ADHD

17:48.800 --> 17:52.280
and the younger sibling who's very energetic

17:52.280 --> 17:53.280
and causes trouble.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.120
Even though sometimes it will-

17:54.120 --> 17:56.400
Yeah, I'm sure you cause trouble just for the camera.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.240
Yeah, right.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.640
I think, yeah, I think, and of course,

17:59.640 --> 18:01.680
once you're live streaming for like four or five hours,

18:01.680 --> 18:02.960
there's gonna be moments in the stream

18:02.960 --> 18:04.080
where it's more chill,

18:04.080 --> 18:07.200
but especially when you're like editing that content

18:07.200 --> 18:10.880
or you're doing bigger streams that are shorter,

18:10.880 --> 18:13.160
you are kind of playing up a side of yourself

18:13.160 --> 18:15.160
because of course, there's a lot of parts of me

18:15.160 --> 18:16.400
that I don't show to the camera

18:16.400 --> 18:18.200
because they're not as entertaining to watch,

18:18.200 --> 18:19.760
like the more serious part.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.440
And also there's things that you are really interested in

18:23.440 --> 18:24.520
about what you do.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.080
Like I love competitive chess where I could sit

18:27.080 --> 18:28.080
and really think about it,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.520
but I know that that is not gonna be

18:29.520 --> 18:30.800
as entertaining for a stream.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.200
I know that's not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.520
So you kind of have to take what you like,

18:35.520 --> 18:38.480
but then really adapt it for whatever the format is.

18:38.480 --> 18:41.800
And sometimes that feels inauthentic,

18:41.800 --> 18:44.520
but other times it just feels like repackaging

18:44.520 --> 18:47.320
what you love for people

18:47.320 --> 18:49.080
in a more general audience to enjoy.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.920
Do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve?

18:51.920 --> 18:53.200
Like-

18:53.200 --> 18:56.320
Oh, I think social media, oh, sorry, go ahead.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.640
Social media in general is a trap of that kind?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.400
Well, so we've been trying to switch

19:01.400 --> 19:03.760
to learn how to make YouTube videos recently.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.400
And so much of learning YouTube school

19:07.440 --> 19:09.640
is kind of the beastification of content

19:09.640 --> 19:12.600
where you try to get to the point of the video

19:12.600 --> 19:15.440
within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.280
You try to-

19:16.280 --> 19:17.200
You mean like Mr. Beast?

19:17.200 --> 19:18.040
Yeah.

19:18.040 --> 19:18.880
Okay.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.400
Yeah, where it's so fast-paced, there's a reason to wait,

19:20.400 --> 19:21.760
there's high stakes.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.480
And everything is created to keep people watching the video

19:24.480 --> 19:26.120
and keep people on the platform.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.360
And in some ways it is a trap

19:28.360 --> 19:32.400
because it's harder to do the kind of content you like

19:32.400 --> 19:34.200
because you really have to squeeze it to be like,

19:34.200 --> 19:36.480
okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.640
Do we have a good title for this?

19:38.640 --> 19:41.080
And that's something that we're trying to figure out

19:41.080 --> 19:45.840
how to keep true to what we wanna do.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.680
Yeah, see, the way I think about it is, yeah,

19:47.680 --> 19:49.400
there's a lot of stuff you can create

19:49.400 --> 19:52.640
and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process,

19:53.480 --> 19:57.200
but also I think about what are the videos,

19:57.200 --> 20:00.320
conversations or things I will create in this life

20:01.160 --> 20:04.040
that will be the best thing I do?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.720
And I try not to do things in my life

20:08.720 --> 20:10.840
that will prevent me from getting there.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.960
I feel like if you're always focusing on doing

20:13.960 --> 20:16.760
kind of optimizing the thumbnail in the 10 seconds

20:16.760 --> 20:19.080
and so on, you'll never do the thing

20:19.080 --> 20:22.720
that's truly you're known for and remembered for.

20:22.720 --> 20:25.080
So finding that balance is tricky.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.240
I get that, but at the same time,

20:27.240 --> 20:28.640
this might be my own copium,

20:28.640 --> 20:31.200
which I know is a word you know now.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.600
Yeah, I'm slowly learning the full complexity

20:33.600 --> 20:35.080
of the term, yes.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.680
But the other way I think about it is,

20:38.680 --> 20:42.640
it is a skill to learn how to communicate

20:42.640 --> 20:44.600
with large audiences.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.240
And first I started streaming chess,

20:47.240 --> 20:49.480
which is something I just did and really loved,

20:49.480 --> 20:52.440
but now I have to learn how to translate that format

20:52.440 --> 20:54.240
and if that's a skillset we could build,

20:54.240 --> 20:57.080
then we could use it to do really important things.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.360
And I've seen a lot of YouTubers who have done interviews

21:00.360 --> 21:02.480
about how they didn't love the kind of content

21:02.480 --> 21:04.800
they did at first, but what they're doing right now

21:04.800 --> 21:06.080
is really meaningful.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.760
So I like to think of it maybe like skill development

21:08.760 --> 21:11.320
because not everybody hits off podcasts

21:11.320 --> 21:13.000
where they can talk to super interesting people

21:13.000 --> 21:14.160
right off the bat.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.280
Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.320
You don't have to worry about the first 10 seconds.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.280
I mean, people like keep pushing me for,

21:21.280 --> 21:25.520
but the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is,

21:25.520 --> 21:27.120
well, I know it's most important for YouTube,

21:27.120 --> 21:28.800
but I don't give a damn.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.240
I wrote a Chrome extension that hides all the views

21:31.240 --> 21:32.080
and likes.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.880
I don't look at the click through.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.040
I don't look at Twitch views, Andrea does,

21:37.040 --> 21:39.160
so we also can relate.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.440
I love numbers too, but that's why I don't look at it

21:41.440 --> 21:44.720
because you become like, oh, you'll start to think

21:44.720 --> 21:47.000
that a conversation or I think you did sucks

21:47.000 --> 21:50.800
because it doesn't get views, but that's just not the case.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.800
The YouTube algorithm is this monster

21:52.800 --> 21:54.480
that figures stuff out.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.520
If you let it control your mind,

21:56.520 --> 21:58.720
I feel like it's gonna destroy you creatively.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.120
So you have to find a nice balance.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.000
I have to say, I was laughing a little bit

22:03.000 --> 22:04.920
when I was listening to the Magnus episode

22:04.920 --> 22:05.840
in the first 10 minutes,

22:05.840 --> 22:08.280
you guys are talking about soccer, football.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.240
Two robots seem human in the conversation.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.560
I was like, let's have some fun,

22:14.560 --> 22:17.760
make conversation about non-chess related topics.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.200
Yeah, talk about sports.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.720
Yeah, it was kind of hilarious.

22:20.720 --> 22:24.880
I was surprised that even at his level,

22:24.880 --> 22:28.720
I wasn't sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.960
It sounds cliche to say,

22:30.120 --> 22:32.520
but the way he looked at a chessboard,

22:32.520 --> 22:33.760
you know those memes like,

22:33.760 --> 22:35.560
I wish somebody looked at me the way,

22:36.520 --> 22:39.320
he's still like the way he glanced down

22:39.320 --> 22:41.160
and he reached for the pieces with excitement

22:41.160 --> 22:42.160
to show me something.

22:42.160 --> 22:46.000
There was, that wasn't like, okay, I'll show you.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.280
It was like, there was still that fire.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.840
That's something that always shocks me

22:50.840 --> 22:54.040
about some of super grandmasters.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.160
One of my coaches was a person who also,

22:57.160 --> 22:58.520
his name's GM Hammer of Norway.

22:58.520 --> 23:01.360
He also coached Magnus, he was his second.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.160
And he was helping me train for my tournament.

23:04.160 --> 23:06.520
And I was kind of putting off doing the homework.

23:06.520 --> 23:07.640
He's like, if you're putting it off,

23:07.640 --> 23:09.240
that means you're studying the wrong thing.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.560
You should be enjoying even when you're practicing,

23:11.560 --> 23:14.640
which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level,

23:14.640 --> 23:17.120
practicing has to be hard and unpleasant.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
And when I was listening to Magnus' episode,

23:19.120 --> 23:20.960
he was like, I didn't read books very much.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.080
Or there's one thing that you said

23:22.080 --> 23:25.280
that's very normal for studying classical chess

23:25.280 --> 23:27.440
that he didn't do just because it didn't interest him.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.200
He says, I suck at puzzles, I don't like puzzles.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.320
Yeah, and he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.680
And that's because it's like purely driven out of passion.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.400
I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.640
Yeah, they liked that, they related.

23:41.640 --> 23:45.320
I don't have to study at all, it's fun.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.960
But I think the lesson there that's really powerful

23:47.960 --> 23:50.000
is he spends most of the day thinking about chess

23:50.000 --> 23:51.480
because he wants to.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.240
So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess,

23:54.240 --> 23:56.880
do whatever it takes to actually just

23:56.880 --> 23:59.480
the number of hours you spend a day thinking about chess,

23:59.480 --> 24:02.120
maximize that, if you're super serious about it.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.800
I actually get very addicted

24:03.800 --> 24:05.760
whenever I start studying chess,

24:05.760 --> 24:08.160
which is why I don't do it as seriously

24:08.160 --> 24:10.640
when I'm focused on content.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.200
Because I go through these rabbit holes

24:13.200 --> 24:14.880
where if I'm focusing on chess,

24:14.880 --> 24:17.600
I want to be as good as I possibly can at the game,

24:17.600 --> 24:19.360
otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it

24:19.360 --> 24:21.320
because it's such a competitive thing.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.280
And I remember training for tournaments.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.160
And when you're training for tournaments,

24:25.160 --> 24:27.520
you even start dreaming about chess

24:27.520 --> 24:29.360
and you can stop thinking about it.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.240
And it's as if you're flipped

24:31.240 --> 24:33.400
into this completely different world,

24:33.400 --> 24:35.280
which is also what I like best about the game,

24:35.280 --> 24:38.400
that it's a completely different living experience.

24:38.400 --> 24:39.400
And then you take some drugs

24:39.400 --> 24:41.560
and now you start to see things on the ceiling.

24:41.560 --> 24:44.440
Is there some factual hallucination

24:44.440 --> 24:48.720
like to the Queen's Gambit, like those scenes?

24:48.720 --> 24:49.880
I think it's-

24:49.880 --> 24:51.640
Is that based on your life story?

24:51.640 --> 24:53.560
Well, can't say that on camera.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.040
No, just kidding.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.400
Actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.560
They drink a lot.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.520
They drink so much.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.760
It's actually crazy for how good they're able

25:03.760 --> 25:05.480
to play chess when they do.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.840
But when it comes to things like psychedelics

25:07.840 --> 25:10.280
or other things, they usually stay away from those

25:10.280 --> 25:12.240
because they don't want to mess anything up in their brain.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.960
So this is actually an intervention.

25:13.960 --> 25:17.120
I saw that you mentioned somewhere,

25:17.120 --> 25:18.400
I think it was the lie detector test

25:18.400 --> 25:20.160
where you have a drinking problem.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.360
Is that an actual-

25:23.000 --> 25:25.400
I think that's actually a meme

25:25.400 --> 25:27.280
that we like to joke about on stream

25:27.280 --> 25:29.560
because occasionally we'd have like a white claw

25:29.560 --> 25:31.080
on stream or something like that.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.240
And then people meme about it.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.680
It goes back to Andrea's point

25:33.680 --> 25:36.680
of amplifying a part of your personality

25:36.680 --> 25:39.560
to make yourself a little bit more entertaining.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.960
I'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.400
This podcast is just amplifying a part of the personality.

25:45.400 --> 25:49.280
I'm not really like this, but have you played drunk?

25:49.280 --> 25:50.680
Magnus has played drunk.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.560
He says it helps someone with the creativity.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.920
Is there any truth to that?

25:53.920 --> 25:56.640
Well, Andrea's under 21, so she's obviously-

25:56.640 --> 25:57.480
Would never do this.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.120
Would never do that.

25:59.120 --> 26:01.240
But I have played while drinking.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.560
Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking

26:05.560 --> 26:08.880
more than pre-gaming or going out to a club and drinking,

26:08.880 --> 26:10.280
which sounds really silly.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.840
And I'll usually play against opponents

26:11.840 --> 26:14.040
who are also having some beer.

26:14.040 --> 26:17.160
And it does make you feel like you're seeing the game

26:17.160 --> 26:18.720
from a fresher perspective

26:18.720 --> 26:21.160
where it can sometimes make you feel

26:21.160 --> 26:23.320
more confident, liquid confidence.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.840
And it does help with creativity.

26:24.840 --> 26:27.480
You just feel like you could pull things off,

26:27.480 --> 26:28.440
but there's also a limit.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.440
It's more like you've had one drink or two drink,

26:30.440 --> 26:31.840
but then it goes beyond that

26:31.840 --> 26:33.560
and then you just start missing tactics

26:33.560 --> 26:34.560
and it's not worth it.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.400
Yeah, I think it only helps players

26:36.400 --> 26:38.040
in very short time controls.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.640
One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream

26:40.640 --> 26:42.280
and we were playing bullet chess,

26:42.280 --> 26:43.760
which is one minute chess.

26:43.760 --> 26:45.800
And I was giving him handicaps and I said,

26:45.840 --> 26:48.520
okay, you have to take four shots before the next game.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.680
And he just got like 10 times stronger

26:50.680 --> 26:52.400
and transformed into like the Hulk

26:52.400 --> 26:55.200
and destroyed me more than the last game.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.800
But of course, if you're playing like a three hour game,

26:57.800 --> 26:58.640
it's gonna get old.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.920
But I think in short time controls, it's amazing.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.520
Yeah, definitely has to be blitz.

27:02.520 --> 27:04.520
It has to be where it's more intuition

27:04.520 --> 27:06.320
rather than sitting and calculating.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.080
This is probably like negatively affecting

27:08.080 --> 27:09.160
your ability to calculate.

27:09.160 --> 27:10.400
Absolutely, yeah.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.680
How much, when you guys play,

27:11.680 --> 27:12.720
when you look at the chessboard,

27:12.720 --> 27:14.080
how much of it is calculation?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.120
How much of it is?

27:16.280 --> 27:19.800
Intuition, how much of it is memorized?

27:19.800 --> 27:21.480
Openings?

27:22.440 --> 27:25.600
It really depends between short form chess.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.680
So five minutes, three minutes, one minute

27:27.680 --> 27:28.960
and classical chess.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.000
What's your favorite to play?

27:30.000 --> 27:33.400
I love playing blitz now because that's most of what I do.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.400
And that's actually how I got into chess streaming

27:35.400 --> 27:37.200
because I couldn't spend entire weekends

27:37.200 --> 27:38.360
or weeks playing tournaments.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.440
So I would just, while I was in college,

27:40.440 --> 27:43.680
log on and play these long blitz or bullet sessions.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.000
And it's very fast.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.440
So you don't have time to go calculate as deeply.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.680
You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.280
And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.320
As three minutes, you said?

27:56.320 --> 27:57.560
Three minutes, yeah.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.400
Okay, cool.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.960
And so for that is just, is basically intuition.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.800
A lot of it is intuition, yeah.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.840
See, I saw on the streams,

28:03.840 --> 28:05.760
you actually keep talking while playing chess.

28:05.760 --> 28:06.600
It seems really difficult.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.440
Yeah, that helps my result.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.640
That doesn't help my results.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.480
It doesn't, it hurts.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.520
It helps the content, not the game.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.600
Yeah, exactly.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.920
But you can still do it.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.960
Because it feels like how can you possibly

28:14.960 --> 28:17.080
concentrate while talking?

28:17.080 --> 28:19.200
It's because so much of it is intuition.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.800
You're not, while you're talking,

28:20.800 --> 28:22.160
you're thinking about that topic,

28:22.160 --> 28:23.400
but then you just come to the board

28:23.400 --> 28:26.240
and you just understand what you should be doing here.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.120
And then sometimes you get in trouble

28:28.120 --> 28:28.960
because you're talking

28:28.960 --> 28:30.560
and you have now lost half of your time.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.400
You have a minute and a half,

28:31.400 --> 28:32.520
your opponent has three,

28:32.520 --> 28:34.360
and you're kind of at a disadvantage.

28:35.520 --> 28:36.960
But that kind of goes to show

28:36.960 --> 28:38.800
that that's how blitz chess usually works,

28:38.800 --> 28:40.320
whereas classical is very different.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.960
Which of you is better at chess?

28:42.360 --> 28:43.280
Let's do it this way.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.400
Can you, Andrea, can you say

28:47.760 --> 28:49.920
in which way is Alex stronger than you?

28:49.920 --> 28:51.800
Which way is she weaker than you?

28:51.800 --> 28:54.840
Not physically in terms of chess.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.320
Well, yes, of course she is higher rated.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.400
But when we do play,

29:00.400 --> 29:01.880
I think her strengths against me,

29:01.880 --> 29:03.760
where she really gets me, is the end game.

29:03.760 --> 29:04.920
She has stronger end games.

29:04.920 --> 29:08.360
So she can, and I actually have a stronger opening.

29:08.360 --> 29:09.200
But as soon as she's able to simplify.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.480
Yeah, I'm supposed to say what is good about you,

29:12.040 --> 29:12.880
but not you.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.720
You know, I'm getting there.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.040
Well, see, that's what I'm saying,

29:15.040 --> 29:17.480
because don't worry, it's related, okay?

29:17.480 --> 29:19.280
Because I can get an advantage

29:19.280 --> 29:20.280
in the beginning of the game,

29:20.280 --> 29:22.240
but as soon as she starts trading pieces down,

29:22.240 --> 29:23.520
like my confidence drops,

29:23.520 --> 29:25.240
because I know that the end game

29:25.240 --> 29:27.600
is the hardest part of the game and the longest,

29:27.600 --> 29:29.320
and that's where she ends up beating me.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.600
So her end game is her,

29:31.600 --> 29:32.920
I think, really what makes the difference.

29:32.920 --> 29:33.760
And she has to be a little bit.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.880
And it sounds like her psychological warfare

29:35.880 --> 29:36.720
is better too.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.560
That definitely.

29:37.560 --> 29:38.560
Because if you're getting nervous.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.400
That is definitely.

29:39.400 --> 29:41.400
But it's harder to play against higher rated players,

29:42.280 --> 29:43.120
because it's the same how, you know,

29:43.120 --> 29:44.960
Magnus and former world champions

29:44.960 --> 29:46.600
have that psychological edge.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.600
So I think it's always going to be different for Andrea,

29:48.600 --> 29:50.400
because she knows, statistically,

29:50.400 --> 29:53.000
she should be winning something like one in four games,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.200
but she usually does better than that,

29:55.200 --> 29:58.080
because she's very distracting and talks a lot.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.160
That does help.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.960
What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.760
What's the experience of that?

30:06.840 --> 30:08.880
Playing somebody like Magnus.

30:08.880 --> 30:11.000
So it depends on how much higher rated

30:11.480 --> 30:12.320
than you they are.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.840
If it's someone who's like between me and Andrea,

30:13.840 --> 30:16.280
let's say it's a 200 point difference.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.320
You know they should win,

30:17.320 --> 30:19.760
but at least you still feel like you have a chance.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.920
I was playing in a title Tuesday,

30:21.920 --> 30:24.560
which is this tournament chess.com has every Tuesday.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.920
And I got really lucky.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.960
Beat a GM, drew an international master.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.560
And then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.520
And my brain just went blank.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.280
Because I just know that I'm so unlikely to win

30:35.280 --> 30:37.600
that I couldn't even play the game properly

30:37.600 --> 30:39.080
when it's that much of a difference

30:39.080 --> 30:42.520
where they should be winning like 99% of the time.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.840
But that's like psychological.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.560
So you're saying that's the biggest experience

30:45.560 --> 30:48.280
is like actually knowing the numbers

30:48.280 --> 30:50.640
and statistically thinking there's no way I can win.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.760
But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling

30:52.760 --> 30:57.760
like positionally you feel like you're constantly under attack?

30:57.880 --> 31:00.680
You just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.680
And the worst is when you don't even know

31:02.680 --> 31:03.840
what you're doing wrong.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.600
You come out of that and you're like,

31:05.600 --> 31:08.520
I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.440
I didn't understand what was going on.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.800
And you're just kind of baffled.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.320
It's kind of like watching AlphaZero beat up Stockfish.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.360
And you don't really understand why it's making certain moves

31:18.360 --> 31:19.800
or how it thought of the plan.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.640
You just see it slowly getting the position better.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.280
And that's what it feels like.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.000
I would add it's kind of different for me

31:27.000 --> 31:29.280
if they're someone who's significantly higher rated.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.040
So let's say more than like 300 points

31:31.040 --> 31:32.760
or you're playing Magnus.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.560
What I notice is I just feel lost straight

31:35.560 --> 31:37.600
as soon as I don't know my preparation.

31:37.640 --> 31:39.440
Because they know so many opening lines

31:39.440 --> 31:41.360
that they're gonna know the best line to beat you

31:41.360 --> 31:42.840
that you haven't studied.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.200
So then on move 10, you're like,

31:44.200 --> 31:47.440
he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage,

31:47.440 --> 31:48.720
which is really small.

31:48.720 --> 31:51.800
But for someone with such a significant skill level,

31:51.800 --> 31:53.320
you know you already lost at that point.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.000
And it's like a third of the game.

31:57.320 --> 32:00.880
What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?

32:00.880 --> 32:04.560
Andrea is very good at opening preparation.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.400
As she said.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.360
As she said.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.720
She likes bringing that up.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.320
I mean, she's very meticulous about it

32:09.320 --> 32:13.640
where she'll really go in and learn her lines.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.000
And having that initial starting confidence

32:16.000 --> 32:17.600
isn't just helpful for the opening,

32:17.600 --> 32:20.280
but it helps develop your plans for the middle game.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.160
So I think she's very good at that.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.840
I think she's actually pretty good at tactical combinations.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.760
What is tactics?

32:29.760 --> 32:33.520
Tactics is like solving puzzles

32:33.520 --> 32:36.520
or basically finding lines that are forced

32:36.520 --> 32:39.120
where if you find them, you're going to win.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.720
So that's like puzzles within a position.

32:41.720 --> 32:42.640
Yeah, exactly.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.800
Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves

32:45.800 --> 32:48.240
and over the process of like 20 moves,

32:48.240 --> 32:49.920
you get a slightly better position

32:49.920 --> 32:54.000
based on an understanding of the overall strategy.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
So in my extensive research of you on Wikipedia,

32:58.400 --> 33:02.880
it says your most played opening is the King's Indian defense

33:02.920 --> 33:05.880
in which, quote, black allows white to advance their pawns

33:05.880 --> 33:09.360
to the center of the board in the first two moves.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.200
Is there any truth to this?

33:11.200 --> 33:13.480
So the King's Indian. And what is it?

33:13.480 --> 33:15.640
Probably is my most played opening.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.080
And it's one where even when my coach

33:19.080 --> 33:21.320
who is a grandmaster taught me, he's like, so you know,

33:21.320 --> 33:23.240
I've been playing the King's Indian for 10 years

33:23.240 --> 33:25.200
and I still don't understand it.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.600
And it's one of those openings

33:26.600 --> 33:28.600
that computers really don't like

33:28.600 --> 33:31.320
because you do, or at least Stockfish doesn't like it.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.960
Maybe AlphaZero would change their mind.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.440
I forgot to look at what-

33:34.440 --> 33:35.920
Can you show me, by the way, what it is?

33:35.920 --> 33:36.760
Yeah.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.920
Is it white's opening or black's opening?

33:39.920 --> 33:44.920
Black responds to the D4 Queen's pawn push

33:45.120 --> 33:46.960
and you take your knight out to F6.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.520
I'll just put in the stereotypical

33:50.520 --> 33:53.200
classical King's Indian more, so to say.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.280
We actually have a very famous King's Indian game

33:57.280 --> 33:58.880
in the notes that we prepared.

33:59.440 --> 34:03.160
For the record, I asked you guys for some games

34:03.160 --> 34:04.480
that you find pretty cool

34:04.480 --> 34:06.720
and maybe to get a chance to talk about some.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.440
Yeah, so this is the King's Indian.

34:09.440 --> 34:14.440
As you can see, white has much more control over the center.

34:14.600 --> 34:16.720
White has three pawns in the center

34:16.720 --> 34:19.600
while black has none past the fifth rank.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.000
And you just have this pawn on D6.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.720
And one of the ideas in chess is

34:23.720 --> 34:25.160
if you're not taking the center,

34:25.160 --> 34:27.160
then your plan revolves around

34:27.160 --> 34:29.640
trying to continually challenge it.

34:29.640 --> 34:33.200
But what is really fun about the King's Indian

34:33.200 --> 34:38.080
is that black sometimes gets these crazy king side attacks

34:38.080 --> 34:39.800
while white gets queen side attacks.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.280
And even though it's a little bit suspicious for black

34:43.280 --> 34:45.760
and the computer could usually break it,

34:45.760 --> 34:49.240
it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked.

34:49.240 --> 34:51.720
But if you don't pull off the attack as black,

34:51.720 --> 34:54.360
then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.520
So it's like a very asymmetrical position.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.960
It's very asymmetrical,

34:57.960 --> 35:00.440
although a lot of people now stop playing

35:00.440 --> 35:02.120
into the classical King's Indian,

35:02.120 --> 35:04.880
even though computers give it a big advantage.

35:04.880 --> 35:08.000
And they play these slower lines in the King's Indian,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.720
which are less fun to play.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.640
What's slower mean?

35:10.640 --> 35:14.680
It takes a longer time to do something interesting with?

35:15.680 --> 35:19.200
They basically don't let you get as much of a king side

35:19.200 --> 35:22.040
attack because they try opening up the center

35:22.040 --> 35:23.840
and then you have no weaknesses,

35:23.840 --> 35:25.760
but you're just slowly improving the position

35:25.760 --> 35:27.840
of your pieces instead of being able

35:27.840 --> 35:29.360
to go for that king side attack.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.600
So for people just listening,

35:30.600 --> 35:34.840
there is the white pawns are all on the fourth row,

35:34.840 --> 35:35.880
in a row together.

35:35.880 --> 35:37.520
That feels like a bad position.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.360
For black?

35:38.360 --> 35:39.480
For white.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.400
Oh, you don't like taking the center?

35:41.400 --> 35:43.480
No, I like taking the center.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.040
Now you're talking trash already.

35:45.040 --> 35:45.880
Oh, sorry.

35:45.880 --> 35:49.520
But like, they're like, feel vulnerable.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.760
They're in a row together.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.400
Like it's like, you know,

35:53.400 --> 35:54.920
cause they're like, who's going to defend them?

35:54.920 --> 35:57.520
I guess the nice defend and the queen defends it.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.480
You're actually talking about a theme

35:59.480 --> 36:02.400
that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.520
And when you have two pawns right next to each other

36:04.520 --> 36:06.360
with no other pawns to defend them.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.440
Yeah.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.960
So it is a valid point.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.760
And actually as black, you're trying to break apart

36:11.760 --> 36:14.520
these pawns or get them to push and create some holes

36:14.520 --> 36:17.640
into the position, but it's a trade-off.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.880
That's a lot of what chess openings are about.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.800
You get more space, but you'll also end up

36:22.800 --> 36:24.640
having to protect your pawns potentially

36:24.640 --> 36:26.080
or move them forward to the point

36:26.080 --> 36:27.200
where they're overextended.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.080
And plus the pawns being vulnerable, it's kind of fun.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.840
It's like, there's more stuff in danger.

36:31.840 --> 36:34.480
They're not, cause if it's like this,

36:34.480 --> 36:36.240
everything is like trapped.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.320
Like you can't do anything.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.160
Everything's blocked.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.000
Yeah.

36:39.000 --> 36:39.840
Blocked off.

36:39.840 --> 36:40.680
Yeah.

36:40.680 --> 36:41.960
You can't have fun.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.800
Yeah.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.800
One of the most, one of the opening principles

36:45.800 --> 36:47.560
for white is get your pawns in the center.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.880
So I'd say like, this is actually preferable for white.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.480
Let's go over some opening principles.

36:53.480 --> 36:54.320
I have no clue about it.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.040
Cause this is a very good learning lesson

36:56.040 --> 36:59.040
for any chess beginners in the audience.

37:01.880 --> 37:02.720
Okay.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.080
So first thing you want to do is control the center.

37:05.080 --> 37:05.920
There we go.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.200
E4, the more aggressive one.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.720
Isn't that like the basic vanilla move?

37:09.720 --> 37:12.960
I didn't, somebody told me that's the most popular

37:12.960 --> 37:14.800
opening move in chess.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.360
Why is that considered aggressive?

37:16.360 --> 37:20.440
So it's E4 and D4 and the king's pawn is known

37:20.440 --> 37:22.680
as being for more tactical players.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.880
Whereas D4 is known for more positional players.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.440
So that's why it's considered more aggressive.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.280
Tactical.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.920
More gambits with E4, I think.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.240
So tactical means I'm going to try to attack you.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.720
Or you're going to try to go for puzzles

37:37.720 --> 37:42.520
and rely more on your combination abilities.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.600
Whereas if it's something positional,

37:44.640 --> 37:46.840
you usually have like three to four moves

37:46.840 --> 37:48.040
that are all good in the position.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.760
Whereas tactics, you need to see this one line.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.280
So it's more precise.

37:52.280 --> 37:56.000
So this one's cool cause the queen can come out,

37:56.000 --> 37:57.080
the bishop can come out.

37:57.080 --> 37:57.920
Yeah.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.520
And that's one of the most popular checkmates.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.320
And usually what you teach new students

38:02.320 --> 38:03.760
to try to cheese their friends.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.960
Cause then they feel really excited

38:04.960 --> 38:07.360
that they know this new trap where you bring the bishop

38:07.360 --> 38:10.080
and the queen out and you try to checkmate on F7.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.320
So the trap that queens gambit,

38:12.320 --> 38:16.280
Beth Harmon falls for in their first game versus the janitor.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.680
She gets all mad cause she gets checkmated very early.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.040
Oh, that's the one she gets checkmated with?

38:20.040 --> 38:20.880
Yeah.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.720
Okay.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.080
I love how you guys were actually paying attention

38:23.080 --> 38:25.280
to the games carefully,

38:25.280 --> 38:26.880
which is pretty cool that they did a good job

38:26.880 --> 38:29.960
of improving, evolving her game throughout the show

38:29.960 --> 38:33.400
to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.240
Yeah.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.560
They really took every detail into consideration,

38:37.560 --> 38:38.480
which was cool.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.800
Okay. So what else?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.640
That's, I brought stuff into the center.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.480
We'll do the same.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.320
Okay.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.560
So then you want to develop your pieces.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.720
So in the beginning of the game,

38:46.720 --> 38:49.160
you want to take out the bishops and knights first

38:49.160 --> 38:50.560
because you don't want to start

38:50.560 --> 38:53.080
with the most valuable piece like the queen

38:53.080 --> 38:54.920
cause then it'll become a vulnerability

38:54.920 --> 38:57.120
and it'll get attacked very early on.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.400
And the reason you're taking out these two pieces first

39:00.400 --> 39:02.480
is cause you want to castle your king.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.680
So you can move a knight move or a bishop move

39:04.680 --> 39:06.720
and that's considered developing.

39:06.720 --> 39:07.560
Yeah.

39:07.560 --> 39:10.320
So if at this stage, not like even before

39:10.400 --> 39:12.000
getting a few pawns out.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.960
You usually want to start with getting a pawn

39:14.960 --> 39:16.960
because you want to get space in the center.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.920
But also when you push pawns,

39:18.920 --> 39:21.160
it helps free up some of your pieces.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.840
So usually start with one pawn first

39:24.840 --> 39:26.880
and then you could start taking out your minor pieces,

39:26.880 --> 39:28.200
which is the bishop and the knight.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.360
I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.720
Defenseless.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.480
But it's not attacked yet.

39:34.480 --> 39:36.080
See, those are what you call ghost threats.

39:36.080 --> 39:38.520
So you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet.

39:38.520 --> 39:40.160
So if I were to attack it.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
I feel like there's a deeper thing going on here.

39:43.000 --> 39:43.840
Yeah.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.680
Actually, let's say.

39:44.680 --> 39:47.440
Yeah, so you're attacking the pawn in the center here

39:47.440 --> 39:50.560
and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that,

39:50.560 --> 39:53.720
I can develop my own knight and defend it as well.

39:53.720 --> 39:54.560
Okay.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.360
And now for people just listening,

39:55.360 --> 39:58.600
there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other

39:58.600 --> 40:00.160
and a couple of knights.

40:00.160 --> 40:02.080
You love the chess commentary.

40:02.080 --> 40:02.920
Yeah.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.920
The pawns met after midnight.

40:04.920 --> 40:05.760
Yeah.

40:05.760 --> 40:06.600
Yeah.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.400
We got to romanticize the game a bit.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.240
Exactly.

40:09.240 --> 40:10.080
Okay, cool.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.840
So if you bring out the bishops with the knights,

40:14.840 --> 40:16.760
you're matching that with the other.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.280
Black is going to match it.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.760
Whatever you're attacking with.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.600
Yep, he's developing.

40:20.600 --> 40:21.440
He's going to defend it.

40:21.440 --> 40:24.240
You could develop your bishop or your knight,

40:24.240 --> 40:25.520
whenever you'd like.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.280
Oh no, now you give him options.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.240
Oh, right.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.000
Yeah, there you go.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.480
Now I am attacking the pawn in the center,

40:32.480 --> 40:34.560
which is what you were afraid about before,

40:34.560 --> 40:36.960
but let's see how you defend it here.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.680
By doing this symmetrical thing,

40:43.680 --> 40:45.680
bringing out the knight on the other side.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.080
And actually your other move was good as well,

40:48.080 --> 40:49.080
defending with the pawn,

40:49.080 --> 40:51.880
because then you're freeing up space for your bishop.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.520
So you're basically trying to develop your pieces

40:54.520 --> 40:56.080
as quickly as possible,

40:56.080 --> 40:57.480
put your pawns in the center,

40:57.480 --> 40:59.320
and then get your king to safety.

40:59.320 --> 41:03.080
And that's usually the basic opening tips that you get.

41:03.080 --> 41:05.720
And it is kind of counterintuitive that safety

41:05.720 --> 41:08.360
is in the corner of the board for a king.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.200
It's true.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.560
That was always confusing to me, but you know.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.880
Three pawns in front,

41:12.880 --> 41:15.480
though you typically don't push those.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.800
Maybe like one, maybe it'll go one square,

41:17.800 --> 41:21.160
but these will be like the wall of defense.

41:21.160 --> 41:22.160
I keep them safe.

41:22.160 --> 41:25.120
But another way to also think about it is

41:25.120 --> 41:28.160
your pieces usually want to point towards the center.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.960
If you have a knight closer to the center,

41:29.960 --> 41:31.520
then closer to the side,

41:31.520 --> 41:34.160
it actually has more squares it can go to.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.320
So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility

41:37.320 --> 41:38.720
for where your pieces go.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.280
So more pieces are going to be able to make threats

41:42.280 --> 41:45.280
in the center or even open up the position.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.520
So since that's where it's most likely to open,

41:48.520 --> 41:50.520
you want your king somewhere where the position

41:50.520 --> 41:52.960
will stay closed so that you have the pawns to defend.

41:52.960 --> 41:54.760
You know, there's like rules like this,

41:54.760 --> 41:57.640
but I was wondering, because I built chess engines,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.480
but then you start to wonder like,

42:00.480 --> 42:03.440
why is it that positionally these things are good?

42:03.440 --> 42:05.480
Like you've built up an intuition about it,

42:05.480 --> 42:08.440
but I wish, and that's the thing that would be amazing,

42:09.120 --> 42:11.200
is that your engines could explain

42:11.200 --> 42:14.400
why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?

42:14.400 --> 42:16.040
You start to build up an intuition,

42:16.040 --> 42:18.920
but if I'm just like, no, nothing about chess,

42:18.920 --> 42:22.120
it feels confusing that cornering your king,

42:22.120 --> 42:26.240
like getting them trapped here.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.920
It feels like you could get checkmated easier there

42:28.920 --> 42:31.920
if I was just using dumb intuition,

42:31.920 --> 42:34.400
but it seems like that's not the case.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.240
Because Alpha Zero learned by playing games

42:37.240 --> 42:38.560
against itself, right?

42:38.560 --> 42:40.840
And I imagine if you have a lot of games,

42:40.840 --> 42:42.360
then you do build an intuition,

42:42.360 --> 42:44.160
because if you were to keep your king in the center,

42:44.160 --> 42:45.400
you just see that in those games,

42:45.400 --> 42:48.440
you're dealing with threats a lot more often.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.320
But yeah, there's shortcut rules,

42:50.320 --> 42:53.120
and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess,

42:53.120 --> 42:55.720
as we've seen with Alpha Zero

42:55.720 --> 42:58.040
kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit.

42:58.040 --> 43:00.720
But as a human, to learn it from scratch

43:00.720 --> 43:03.320
is a lot more difficult than to start with principles.

43:03.320 --> 43:07.560
So that's why beginners usually learn chess this way.

43:07.560 --> 43:09.960
Yeah, because you're playing other humans,

43:09.960 --> 43:11.960
and the other humans have also operated

43:11.960 --> 43:13.000
on the different principles.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.960
And that's why people that come up now

43:15.960 --> 43:17.680
that are training with engines

43:18.520 --> 43:20.400
are just going to be much better

43:20.400 --> 43:21.520
than the people of the past,

43:21.520 --> 43:24.880
because they're gonna try out weirder ideas

43:24.880 --> 43:27.000
that go against the principles of old,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
and they're gonna do weird stuff,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.840
including sacrifices and stuff like that.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.080
Yeah, and I also think that's why Alpha Zero

43:33.720 --> 43:34.560
was so shocking,

43:34.560 --> 43:37.280
because Stockfish was using an opening database.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.720
So it was already based off of knowledge

43:39.720 --> 43:41.880
that humans have from playing chess for years

43:41.880 --> 43:43.840
that we just thought is how you're supposed to play,

43:43.840 --> 43:45.280
whereas Alpha Zero just learned

43:45.280 --> 43:47.240
from playing the game so many times

43:47.240 --> 43:49.880
and came up with very novel opening ideas.

43:49.880 --> 43:52.000
Were you impressed by Alpha Zero?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.200
Have you seen some of the games?

43:53.200 --> 43:54.480
I have seen some of the games.

43:54.480 --> 43:59.480
I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated

43:59.480 --> 44:01.360
were the three things I experienced.

44:01.600 --> 44:04.880
I think Magnus said he was also impressed

44:04.880 --> 44:09.000
that it could easily be mistaken for creativity.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.800
That's his trash talk towards the AI.

44:10.800 --> 44:12.360
That was a beautiful sentence.

44:12.360 --> 44:14.480
I was listening to the podcast.

44:14.480 --> 44:17.120
I mean, as a human, I agree with him,

44:17.120 --> 44:18.400
because you don't wanna give the machine

44:18.400 --> 44:20.440
the power of creativity,

44:20.440 --> 44:25.440
but if it looks creative, give it a compliment.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.320
That's fair.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.280
I know that you're being nice to the machines

44:29.280 --> 44:32.480
in case they are ever looking back through this.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.320
What else is there?

44:33.320 --> 44:36.920
What other principles are there for the opening?

44:36.920 --> 44:39.840
You can go a little bit more forward, let's say.

44:39.840 --> 44:41.960
Yeah, we can finish full of development.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.280
Positions like this.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.800
Let's just say you developed all of your pieces.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.480
So that's like a really nice,

44:49.480 --> 44:51.680
like nobody took any pieces

44:51.680 --> 44:53.800
and we're just in a nice positional thing.

44:53.800 --> 44:56.920
Yeah, so it's not actually a very accurate one.

44:56.920 --> 44:59.160
So I'm actually, I could put a different one on the board,

45:00.000 --> 45:03.160
but usually after you've developed all of your pieces,

45:03.160 --> 45:05.480
you wanna get your queen out a little bit

45:05.480 --> 45:06.720
to connect your rooks

45:06.720 --> 45:09.320
and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes

45:09.320 --> 45:11.200
and getting more space.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.240
But another good tip is just,

45:13.240 --> 45:15.840
can you improve the position of your pieces?

45:15.840 --> 45:16.920
Think about timing.

45:16.920 --> 45:19.000
So if you've already moved a piece once

45:19.000 --> 45:20.600
and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all,

45:20.600 --> 45:23.440
then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all

45:23.440 --> 45:26.680
to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.640
Right, so don't move pieces multiple times.

45:29.160 --> 45:31.480
Like try to move it to the most optimal position.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.320
Yeah.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.560
Yeah, that makes sense.

45:35.120 --> 45:37.440
So what's the Indian,

45:37.440 --> 45:38.800
I think we kind of went over it,

45:38.800 --> 45:41.880
but did you ever say why you like it so much?

45:41.880 --> 45:43.440
Cause it's weird, cause it's king side?

45:43.440 --> 45:48.240
I liked it because it's a very fun, aggressive defense

45:48.240 --> 45:52.000
where you're just throwing your pieces towards white

45:52.000 --> 45:55.760
and there's so many sacrificing opportunities.

45:55.760 --> 45:58.360
And for some reason, tactical games always feel

45:59.080 --> 46:01.280
like the most beautiful, the most satisfying.

46:01.280 --> 46:03.160
And that's what I liked about the King's Indian.

46:03.160 --> 46:06.400
But I also suffered a lot from this love

46:06.400 --> 46:07.600
because I would play things

46:07.600 --> 46:09.480
that are not necessarily correct,

46:09.480 --> 46:11.080
then my attack wouldn't pan out.

46:11.080 --> 46:12.840
And then I would just struggle the rest of the game

46:12.840 --> 46:14.640
having no play and just trying to defend.

46:14.640 --> 46:16.960
So if you're always, Wikipedia also says that,

46:16.960 --> 46:19.720
that you're known for your attacking play.

46:19.720 --> 46:22.600
It's also known for losses according to Stanford.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.840
Okay, let's not bring that up.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.640
See Wikipedia doesn't talk trash.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.440
It just says nice things.

46:27.440 --> 46:29.160
Wikipedia is a lot nicer.

46:29.160 --> 46:32.680
I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic

46:32.680 --> 46:35.360
cause I really liked the slow squeeze.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.680
But when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess,

46:38.680 --> 46:40.600
it's almost as if I was looking

46:40.600 --> 46:42.360
for more instant gratification

46:42.360 --> 46:44.280
cause it feels so much better

46:44.280 --> 46:46.360
to beat someone with an attack.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.360
And even if sometimes it doesn't pan out,

46:48.360 --> 46:51.280
I was okay with it cause you get so many games in.

46:51.280 --> 46:54.240
So I think my style in online chess

46:54.240 --> 46:56.360
really changed from my classical chess.

46:56.360 --> 46:57.200
What about you, Andrea?

46:57.200 --> 46:58.200
Do you have a style?

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
Are you attacking?

46:59.200 --> 47:02.760
Are you a more like conservative defensive player?

47:02.760 --> 47:03.720
Are you chaotic?

47:03.720 --> 47:06.240
Opening wise, I like to play more positionally.

47:06.240 --> 47:09.760
Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces

47:09.760 --> 47:10.800
and slowly get an attack.

47:10.800 --> 47:13.480
But like Alex said, if you're playing bullet chess

47:13.480 --> 47:15.520
or blitz against viewers,

47:15.520 --> 47:19.240
you often like wanna play riskier moves

47:19.240 --> 47:20.720
that may not be as good.

47:20.720 --> 47:23.160
And then that's kind of when I would play more aggressive.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.400
But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason

47:25.400 --> 47:29.200
cause then like once her 15 moves in,

47:29.200 --> 47:31.480
which as soon as you're out of your prep,

47:31.480 --> 47:33.880
I like sitting and thinking in more positional,

47:34.960 --> 47:37.280
yeah, positional middle games.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.920
One of the games you've found to be pretty cool

47:39.920 --> 47:44.800
is the Hikaru Nakamura versus Gelfand in 2009.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.680
And that one, I think, includes the King's Indian defense.

47:47.680 --> 47:48.960
Yes.

47:48.960 --> 47:52.240
What's, why is that an interesting one to you?

47:52.240 --> 47:54.160
I also play the King's Indian as black

47:54.160 --> 47:56.240
and I love this model game.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.160
But, and as Alex was saying,

47:58.160 --> 48:00.440
like all these advantages for the King's Indian.

48:00.440 --> 48:02.160
But now there's this one line

48:02.160 --> 48:04.360
that like every higher rated player

48:04.360 --> 48:06.600
just destroys my King's Indian.

48:06.600 --> 48:08.560
And you see these beautiful games and like,

48:08.560 --> 48:10.640
ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas.

48:10.640 --> 48:12.240
But now no one plays into it anymore.

48:12.240 --> 48:13.400
And you just get demolished.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.320
So this is why I don't play the King's Indian anymore,

48:15.320 --> 48:16.440
but not through in the funner.

48:16.440 --> 48:18.240
The love hate relationship, truly.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.280
The reality.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.960
But that's like the higher level players do

48:20.960 --> 48:21.800
or does everybody?

48:21.800 --> 48:23.480
Yeah, if you're studying openings

48:23.480 --> 48:25.400
and you know this line as white,

48:25.400 --> 48:27.920
you automatically get the upper edge.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.720
And that's kind of how openings develop.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.800
You start having players trying new lines

48:32.800 --> 48:35.160
and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it

48:35.160 --> 48:36.560
if they think it's the best one.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.480
But yeah, so Hikaru is really known

48:38.480 --> 48:40.960
for his aggressive style of play.

48:40.960 --> 48:42.120
Is Hikaru black here or what?

48:42.120 --> 48:43.200
Yeah, Hikaru is black here.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.200
So he's playing the King's Indian.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.520
And as you can see in this position,

48:47.520 --> 48:51.280
white already has a lot, a huge center advantage.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.840
But what Hikaru is gonna start doing,

48:52.840 --> 48:54.240
even with the next move,

48:54.240 --> 48:57.600
is bringing all of his pieces towards the white King's side

48:57.600 --> 49:00.520
because his plan is to start pushing his pawns

49:00.520 --> 49:01.680
towards the white King

49:01.680 --> 49:03.720
and ignore the attack that goes on in the Queen's side.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.840
This is a great example of the dream attack

49:05.840 --> 49:06.920
with the King's Indian.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.960
So there's a complete asymmetry towards the King's side

49:09.960 --> 49:12.680
and the left side of the board is a ton of pieces.

49:12.680 --> 49:13.760
Yeah, exactly.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.400
Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row.

49:17.400 --> 49:19.080
Yep, and that's what you need to do

49:19.080 --> 49:20.600
because you have to move the knight

49:20.600 --> 49:22.640
in order to make space for your pawn.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.520
So again, this is why it's so counterintuitive

49:25.520 --> 49:26.880
and Stockfish doesn't like it.

49:26.880 --> 49:30.360
You're putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank

49:30.360 --> 49:32.080
and you're pushing your King's side pawns

49:32.080 --> 49:34.040
and you're blocking your own dark squared bishop.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.920
So none of it makes sense.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.280
You're mimicking it, that's awesome.

49:38.280 --> 49:40.800
Okay, so yeah, here you see white going for Queen's side

49:40.800 --> 49:43.160
attack, black going for the King's side attack

49:43.160 --> 49:44.440
and you can keep going a little bit

49:44.440 --> 49:48.240
and I'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.760
It's more fun to analyze games in person

49:50.760 --> 49:51.960
than on the computer, I think.

49:52.160 --> 49:53.720
Okay, here we go.

49:53.720 --> 49:57.320
Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack

49:57.320 --> 49:59.160
and what I really like about this game

49:59.160 --> 50:01.600
is that he finds these tactics

50:01.600 --> 50:05.200
that are not necessarily what a computer would go for

50:05.200 --> 50:07.720
but it's very hard to face as a human

50:07.720 --> 50:09.880
and that's why a lot of people play the King's Indian

50:09.880 --> 50:12.120
because in practice it's hard to defend against.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.360
So we can keep moving a little bit forward.

50:16.640 --> 50:17.480
Okay.

50:19.040 --> 50:21.760
Yep, so White is just continuing the King's side plan.

50:22.760 --> 50:25.200
Is that like the first piece I think that's taken in the game?

50:25.200 --> 50:26.520
Yep, that's the first trade.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.880
So he begins.

50:27.880 --> 50:30.720
Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit

50:30.720 --> 50:33.040
to just make sure that White didn't have

50:33.040 --> 50:35.240
two dire threats on the Queen's side.

50:35.240 --> 50:37.480
So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing.

50:37.480 --> 50:39.840
Exactly, that's what's beautiful about the King's Indian.

50:39.840 --> 50:41.280
And just one thing to highlight

50:41.280 --> 50:44.160
because his rook move here is very bizarre

50:44.160 --> 50:46.960
and typically like a computer probably didn't like this

50:46.960 --> 50:48.800
but the idea is very interesting

50:48.800 --> 50:51.040
because this is a major weakness for black

50:51.120 --> 50:52.480
that they're coming to attack

50:52.480 --> 50:54.640
and he's also making room for his bishop

50:54.640 --> 50:56.080
to come backwards and challenge.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.720
So this is like a human-like maneuver that computers

50:58.720 --> 51:00.440
I think computers would like this though

51:00.440 --> 51:02.440
because you'd have to move it regardless

51:02.440 --> 51:03.920
because he takes the pawn here

51:03.920 --> 51:05.720
and his rook would be under attack.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.840
Yeah, well, having looked at it,

51:07.840 --> 51:09.360
when I actually studied this as a line

51:09.360 --> 51:11.000
and this right away isn't the best move

51:11.000 --> 51:11.840
cutting a computer.

51:11.840 --> 51:13.360
So actually that's a good question.

51:13.360 --> 51:15.520
So you guys, when you study games, use your own mind

51:15.520 --> 51:19.480
but do you also use computers to build up your intuition

51:19.480 --> 51:20.920
of like looking at a position like this

51:21.760 --> 51:22.600
and what would a computer do

51:22.600 --> 51:24.880
and then try to understand why it wants to do that?

51:24.880 --> 51:26.640
When I was studying seriously,

51:26.640 --> 51:28.640
I would try to use my own mind

51:28.640 --> 51:31.480
because you're never gonna get the exact same position.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.600
So you really need to notice trends

51:33.600 --> 51:35.360
and often computers will give you moves

51:35.360 --> 51:38.120
that are only specific to that position

51:38.120 --> 51:40.360
because of a certain tactic.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.080
But I do use computers to check what I did

51:43.080 --> 51:44.840
and make sure I didn't make any obvious blunder

51:44.840 --> 51:46.000
that I might've missed.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.040
What does a computer tell you?

51:47.040 --> 51:49.120
Just like what is the best move

51:49.120 --> 51:52.640
or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?

51:52.640 --> 51:54.160
It doesn't tell you why

51:54.160 --> 51:57.120
but it gives you the different valuations of the position

51:57.120 --> 52:01.240
like black is down a half pawn here or something like that

52:02.200 --> 52:04.640
but it hints you towards what the right move is

52:04.640 --> 52:06.720
and then it's on you to figure out why.

52:06.720 --> 52:09.360
And you could usually figure out why if not right away

52:09.360 --> 52:10.760
then just by going through a few moves

52:10.760 --> 52:12.960
and being like, oh, okay, that makes sense.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.120
I feel like a computer will take you down

52:15.120 --> 52:17.080
with some weird lines potentially.

52:17.240 --> 52:21.040
Like sacrifice, like why the hell am I sacrificing this?

52:21.040 --> 52:23.400
Well, we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon.

52:24.600 --> 52:25.920
So we could just keep playing for a little bit.

52:25.920 --> 52:27.520
The pawns are being pushed forward?

52:27.520 --> 52:28.360
Yeah.

52:29.280 --> 52:33.880
And Hikaru is kind of ignoring the queenside attack here.

52:33.880 --> 52:37.280
They basically both only reply to each other's plan

52:37.280 --> 52:38.360
when they have to.

52:39.440 --> 52:42.000
This is where you convert all the podcast viewers

52:42.000 --> 52:43.240
to YouTube.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.080
Yeah.

52:44.080 --> 52:46.240
They have no idea what we're talking about right now.

52:46.240 --> 52:48.200
There is a Zen like experience

52:48.200 --> 52:50.320
of just like listening and imagining.

52:50.320 --> 52:51.160
The board.

52:51.160 --> 52:53.040
Just imagine the pieces on the ceiling.

52:53.040 --> 52:55.280
Yeah, you should, we should be calling them out

52:55.280 --> 52:56.920
and then people will be freaking out even more.

52:56.920 --> 52:59.120
Am I supposed to keep track of what the position is?

52:59.120 --> 52:59.960
We should.

52:59.960 --> 53:02.160
It's too late now, there's too many.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.480
How hard is blindfold chess?

53:03.480 --> 53:05.600
Have you tried like, are you able to keep the board?

53:05.600 --> 53:07.520
I've played blindfold chess before.

53:08.440 --> 53:09.720
For me, it's pretty hard.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.400
It's not a muscle that I've trained as much

53:11.400 --> 53:13.480
and I'm very visual when it comes to chess

53:14.440 --> 53:16.680
but it is one as a top player

53:16.680 --> 53:19.880
that starts becoming very second nature for you.

53:19.880 --> 53:22.840
Actually, this is what, I'll talk to Magnus about this.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.240
Maybe I was, again, influenced by Queen's Gambit.

53:26.240 --> 53:29.000
What do you actually visualize when it's in your head?

53:29.000 --> 53:31.120
So for Magnus, it was a boring 2D board.

53:31.120 --> 53:31.960
Right.

53:31.960 --> 53:32.800
Do you have some kind of-

53:32.800 --> 53:34.560
That's every chess player know.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.400
You don't have like,

53:35.400 --> 53:38.320
because you know some chess, like computer games,

53:38.320 --> 53:40.360
you can do all kinds of skins and like-

53:40.360 --> 53:41.200
Yeah.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.040
Like fancy stuff.

53:42.040 --> 53:42.880
You don't have anything fancy.

53:42.880 --> 53:45.960
I don't have like a cool 3D warrior mode on.

53:45.960 --> 53:46.800
It's just the basic-

53:46.800 --> 53:49.080
I just have a default chess base board in my head.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.880
Cause you don't, yeah, you can't use your brain power

53:51.880 --> 53:53.280
for adding colors to it

53:53.280 --> 53:55.360
cause you already have to keep track of the pieces.

53:55.360 --> 53:56.960
As one board at a time?

53:56.960 --> 53:57.800
Yes.

53:57.800 --> 53:58.620
Okay.

53:58.620 --> 53:59.460
The current position.

53:59.460 --> 54:00.280
Yeah, I bet every chess,

54:00.280 --> 54:01.880
I wonder if there's any who get it differently.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.480
There's certain players who are really good

54:04.480 --> 54:06.320
and they can even play blindfold chess

54:06.320 --> 54:08.560
and play multiple games at the same time.

54:09.680 --> 54:11.480
So I would be curious how they do it

54:11.480 --> 54:13.200
but usually when you're thinking of one game,

54:13.200 --> 54:15.000
that's the only one in your mind.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.560
Yeah, but you have to do this operation

54:16.560 --> 54:18.680
where you move one piece,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.800
you're doing like the branch analysis, like-

54:22.800 --> 54:23.720
Yeah.

54:23.720 --> 54:27.440
And so you still have to somehow visualize

54:27.440 --> 54:31.400
the branching process and not forget stuff.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.640
Maybe that's like constant memory recall or something.

54:34.640 --> 54:36.640
You're always looking at one board at a time, but-

54:36.640 --> 54:38.080
And you're also, oh, cause you're also looking

54:38.080 --> 54:38.920
in the future.

54:38.920 --> 54:39.760
Yeah.

54:39.760 --> 54:40.600
Cause then you have to backtrack to-

54:40.840 --> 54:44.160
I guess you're keeping the position in your memory.

54:44.160 --> 54:45.960
So you're remembering where all the pieces are

54:45.960 --> 54:48.280
and then you're playing it out on one board

54:48.280 --> 54:50.760
and then you can come back to the initial one

54:50.760 --> 54:52.320
that you started with that you kind of just

54:52.320 --> 54:55.320
keep in your brain and it's also easier to come back to it

54:55.320 --> 54:57.600
once you've played a position from it.

54:57.600 --> 55:02.600
I feel like it's that memory recall

55:03.080 --> 55:04.800
that gets you to blunder.

55:04.800 --> 55:09.160
So I'll like see that I'm being attacked by certain things

55:09.160 --> 55:11.880
but then because I get so exhausted thinking

55:11.880 --> 55:14.800
about a different thing, I actually forget

55:14.800 --> 55:16.520
about an entire branch of things

55:16.520 --> 55:17.840
that I was supposed to be worried about.

55:17.840 --> 55:18.960
It happens very often.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.680
Yeah. If you spend a bunch of time calculating

55:21.680 --> 55:23.800
in a position, let's say, like when you're really

55:23.800 --> 55:26.840
in trouble and you're spending 15, 20 minutes calculating,

55:26.840 --> 55:29.040
you'll forget about something that you spotted like,

55:29.040 --> 55:32.120
oh, if I do these two, three moves, I'll walk into a trap

55:32.120 --> 55:34.080
cause you've looked at so many lines and then you play it

55:34.080 --> 55:36.480
and then you see it and you're like, oh, I looked at it

55:36.480 --> 55:38.240
and I saw it, but I forgot about it.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.080
Yeah.

55:39.920 --> 55:41.800
It's often called tunneling where you're just looking

55:41.800 --> 55:43.400
so deeply on one thing you forget

55:43.400 --> 55:45.120
about the rest of the board.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.960
And it's the worst when, at least in a beginner level,

55:47.960 --> 55:51.320
there's like a, I don't know, a bishop just sitting there

55:51.320 --> 55:54.680
obviously attacking your like queen or something.

55:54.680 --> 55:57.640
And then you just forget that bishop exists.

55:57.640 --> 56:01.040
Cause if they just sit there for a few moves and don't move,

56:01.040 --> 56:02.920
you just forget their existence.

56:02.920 --> 56:04.320
And then it's just, yeah,

56:04.320 --> 56:05.720
that's definitely very embarrassing.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.040
Well, it happens to everyone.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.600
So.

56:08.600 --> 56:09.440
Yes.

56:10.360 --> 56:11.480
Okay, cool.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.320
Okay.

56:12.320 --> 56:16.080
So we see a few trades happening on the queen side

56:16.080 --> 56:17.560
where he had to go for those.

56:17.560 --> 56:19.000
Otherwise he's in trouble.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.240
And this is where the game, oh, sorry.

56:22.240 --> 56:24.000
This is where it gets exciting.

56:24.000 --> 56:24.840
Yeah.

56:24.840 --> 56:28.880
So nine H four is really when the sacrifice starts.

56:28.880 --> 56:33.360
And here the two important pawns are the ones in front

56:33.360 --> 56:35.920
of the king, cause they're helping with the entire defense.

56:36.080 --> 56:38.840
And Ikaru is actually preparing to sacrifice his knight

56:38.840 --> 56:42.480
for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack

56:42.480 --> 56:43.840
and open up the position.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.800
Because if you don't do that, you're as black

56:45.800 --> 56:47.080
and don't get some kind of attack.

56:47.080 --> 56:49.360
You are completely lost on the queen side.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.960
And also you've pushed all of your own king side pawns.

56:51.960 --> 56:53.160
So you're going to be in danger.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.800
So it's one of those do or die moments.

56:55.800 --> 56:56.640
Oh, okay.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.720
So that, that's what makes it all in.

56:57.720 --> 56:58.880
Cause the king is wide open.

56:58.880 --> 56:59.840
Yeah, yeah.

56:59.840 --> 57:03.520
The king is wide open and you, all of white's pieces

57:03.520 --> 57:04.960
are pointed towards the queen side too,

57:04.960 --> 57:06.120
where you're also cramped.

57:06.120 --> 57:08.240
So it's the attack primarily by black done

57:08.240 --> 57:10.360
by the two pawns and the knight.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.200
And the light squared Bishop is always extremely important.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.280
So you don't want to trade this in the King's Indian

57:15.280 --> 57:18.480
because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.000
Even though it's on the other side of the board,

57:20.000 --> 57:24.040
I guess it can go all the way across in, like, I don't,

57:24.040 --> 57:25.200
I'm not sure what it's doing here,

57:25.200 --> 57:26.280
but probably threatening.

57:26.280 --> 57:29.000
For example, if, if it was another move

57:29.000 --> 57:32.040
black could have played would be something like Bishop H three

57:32.040 --> 57:33.240
where if you take the Bishop,

57:33.240 --> 57:35.480
you actually get mated on G two.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.320
With what?

57:36.320 --> 57:39.240
So let's say you take here and then you could push the pawn

57:39.240 --> 57:40.960
and then it would be checkmate.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.520
So you're kind of using your Bishop to sacrifice

57:44.520 --> 57:47.440
against white's King side pawns.

57:47.440 --> 57:48.280
Yeah.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.560
I'll be freaking out if their Bishop did that.

57:50.560 --> 57:51.400
Exactly.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.240
What are they up to?

57:52.240 --> 57:53.240
Right. And that's the thing.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.360
This position looks very scary as white

57:55.360 --> 57:57.240
because all of black's pawns are starting

57:57.240 --> 57:58.600
to come towards you.

57:58.600 --> 58:02.280
And it's one of those things where humans do start to worry

58:02.280 --> 58:04.440
in these positions, whereas computers obviously

58:04.440 --> 58:05.840
can just calculate the best line

58:05.840 --> 58:07.560
and maybe the attack doesn't go through.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.240
So you're saying the computer might say

58:09.240 --> 58:12.200
that the white is actually a slight favorite here.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.040
Yeah.

58:13.040 --> 58:13.880
It's possible. Exactly.

58:13.880 --> 58:17.080
Okay. So then white makes a little bit of room

58:17.080 --> 58:18.160
by moving the rook.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.000
Right.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
And the attack begins.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.880
I like, I like the commentary here.

58:21.880 --> 58:26.240
The knight, the knight is hugging the King.

58:26.240 --> 58:28.840
And actually white can't even take the King here

58:28.840 --> 58:31.400
because then H four and H three is coming in.

58:31.440 --> 58:32.640
But can't take the knight.

58:32.640 --> 58:33.880
Yeah. Oh, did I say King?

58:33.880 --> 58:34.720
Yes. Thank you.

58:34.720 --> 58:35.560
The knight.

58:35.560 --> 58:36.400
Why can't take the knight?

58:36.400 --> 58:37.480
Because why?

58:37.480 --> 58:39.400
So if white takes the knight here,

58:39.400 --> 58:42.000
then black starts pushing his pawn to H four

58:42.000 --> 58:43.840
with H three incoming.

58:43.840 --> 58:48.280
And the idea of trying to defend against this is,

58:48.280 --> 58:49.800
it looks very difficult.

58:49.800 --> 58:51.280
So white just chooses.

58:51.280 --> 58:53.280
It'd be cool to watch chess game,

58:53.280 --> 58:56.000
to experience watching it without understanding it

58:56.000 --> 58:57.120
just for a day.

58:57.120 --> 58:59.520
Feel like I could use that to make better content.

58:59.520 --> 59:00.360
True.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.480
I mean, that's what getting drunk does.

59:04.480 --> 59:05.760
Unfortunately for chess players,

59:05.760 --> 59:07.600
it never leaves your brain.

59:07.600 --> 59:08.880
Doesn't matter how.

59:08.880 --> 59:10.840
But this is actually a very cute move

59:10.840 --> 59:13.480
because black's queen is under attack,

59:13.480 --> 59:16.880
but the King is so cramped that he can't actually take it

59:16.880 --> 59:18.680
or he's going to get checkmated by a pawn,

59:18.680 --> 59:20.920
which is a sad way to go, truly.

59:20.920 --> 59:23.240
Yeah. Those pawns are doing a lot of work here.

59:23.240 --> 59:24.080
They really are.

59:24.080 --> 59:24.920
That is the King's Indian.

59:24.920 --> 59:26.520
This is the King's Indian player.

59:26.520 --> 59:29.120
The attack of the King side pawns.

59:29.120 --> 59:31.240
Yeah. These pawns are like, right.

59:32.080 --> 59:33.800
So they're the ones that are doing a lot of the threatening.

59:33.800 --> 59:35.960
Right. And they're also opening up the position

59:35.960 --> 59:37.640
to bring more of the pieces in,

59:37.640 --> 59:41.560
but the pawns kind of help break open the King side,

59:41.560 --> 59:43.560
but they can't checkmate by themselves.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.880
So after the pawns come in,

59:44.880 --> 59:46.760
that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well,

59:46.760 --> 59:49.320
which you will see Hikaru do here.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.160
Okay. There you go.

59:50.160 --> 59:51.720
He puts- What more sacrifice?

59:51.720 --> 59:54.240
So this was actually another beautiful sacrifice

59:54.240 --> 59:55.200
in the game.

59:56.360 --> 59:59.040
But then puts the King in check with a pawn.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.120
Right. And the pawn is going to be given here

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.160
for free, but the idea is you're giving your own piece

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.640
because you want to have more space and open up the King,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:09.240
which is what you're always trying to do

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.080
when you have a King side.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.160
You're trying to remove as many of the King's defenders

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.560
as you can without giving up too much of-

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:17.640
And then you have a ton of pieces on the King side

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.320
for black just waiting to-

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.360
Exactly.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.440
To do harm.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.280
And then-

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.360
And notice how every single move,

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:26.800
white is getting attacked.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.440
Like they're just never getting a break.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.960
Black just keeps throwing all their pieces.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.520
So it's funny that black's Queen has been hanging

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.920
for like three moves now

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.680
and white still can't do anything about it.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.920
Yeah. So Rook puts the King in check.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.760
Yep.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.200
The King runs.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.000
And then again, we leave the Queen hanging

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.160
and you develop a piece, the slight squared Bishop.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.000
That's so important.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.040
And you're once again threatening checkmate on G2.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.640
And then Bishop's coming to the game.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.880
Once again, the Queen hanging.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.520
I mean, the game is just so beautiful.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.520
The amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.320
Feels like so much is in danger.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.160
Right.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.000
It's so interesting.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.040
And Knight takes what?

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.880
A pawns.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.920
So now his Queen is attacked twice and he doesn't care.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.200
He takes the Bishop and he's still threatening

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.800
the checkmate on G2.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.200
And then the Queen takes the Bishop.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.040
Yep.

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:24.280
So now he's defending against G2

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.720
and black just goes and grabs some material back here.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.400
So here black is already is winning.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.200
Well, he ends up winning a Knight here

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.240
because black had to be so much on the defensive.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400
He's just taking pieces.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.880
Yeah. I mean, at this point you're up two whole pieces.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.000
So you would resign here.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.280
Yeah, exactly.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.800
And Queen.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.440
Queen.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:53.240
And then you take and then the Rook takes

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.760
and there's not as much of an attack on the King anymore

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.760
but Hikaru is up a Knight here, which is GG.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.840
Yeah. What's the correct way of saying that?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:09.040
Cause I played Demis Asabas, I played him in chess

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.440
and then I quickly realized like from his facial expressions

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.560
that I should have like stopped playing.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.400
Oh.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.040
It was like, it's already set.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.040
Yeah.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.720
And then he's like, this is the good time to like give up.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.560
Right.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.720
You're not gonna get to checkmate where like this,

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.320
he could see like the checkmate is like five

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.480
or seven moves away or something.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.840
And what's the play?

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.760
Usually you have to resign if you're in a position

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.840
or you should through chess etiquette resign

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.800
when you're in a position where your opponent

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.680
is definitely gonna win out of respect.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.560
Like if you're a piece down

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.680
and obviously all top grandmasters do that.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.920
The only people who don't do that is kids

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.720
cause their coaches always tell them never resign

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.880
and they'll be in hopelessly lost positions

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.440
playing against like two Rooks, a King

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.960
and they only have their soul King

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:05.800
but they're still playing on.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.000
So that's a position where it's obvious they can't win.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.600
Cause the kids might make errors.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:10.440
Yeah.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.440
And so it might as well.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.760
That was the interesting thing about, I think

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.760
game six of the previous world championship with Magnus.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.400
Was it the one where he beat Nep?

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.320
Yeah, the first time he beat him where it was like

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.000
he said that, I don't know how often

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.840
you come across this kind of situation.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.880
He said the engines predict the draw.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.720
Yeah.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.440
But that doesn't mean that it's going to be a draw.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.440
So you play on hoping that you take a person into,

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.520
I mean, this is, I guess an end game thing.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.680
You take them to deep water

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.880
and they make a positional mistake or something.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.400
I don't know when, like he from his gut knows

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.720
that this isn't supposed to be a draw,

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.040
but he still plays on.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.880
Yeah.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.600
I mean, that is one where it could theoretically be a draw

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.840
but it could be very hard to defend

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.720
cause it's a hard technique to know as a human.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:01.120
And especially in that game,

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.120
I know that Nepo was also in time pressure

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.680
which makes it even harder.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.920
So in situations like that, you should always continue.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.200
It's more where an engine would give you something

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.440
like plus 10 or something where it's not just clearly a win

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.000
but anybody would know how to win.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.840
And that's where you're usually supposed to resign.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.800
So what do you find beautiful about this game?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:25.800
Is it the attacking chess and just the asymmetry of it?

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.920
It's the asymmetry.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.440
And it's the fact that this is the dream

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.040
for the King's Indian

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.320
where you're able to get a beautiful attack.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:40.120
And there was also those two really nice sacrifices

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.560
where black just continuously kept putting pressure

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.680
on White's King to the point where he was able

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:47.120
to win material.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.120
And the best part of it is that if the attack didn't work

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.320
out, Black would have been completely lost.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.960
How often does that happen by the way?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.320
Like as an attacking player,

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.640
you like how often do you put yourself in the position

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.800
of like I'm screwed unless this works out?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.080
In online chess more than I should.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.760
And it's usually when I sacrifice,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:08.440
I know it's either gonna work or I'm lost.

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.520
And those are the most fun positions to play usually.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.880
But in tournaments, if you're doing a sacrifice,

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:18.600
you're playing it with 100% confidence

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.560
because you're taking the time to calculate it.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.880
But yeah, when you have three minutes, you don't have time.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.280
So you take a whim and you follow your intuition.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:27.000
Or you find out later.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.320
Or you're very confident it'll work

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.520
and you haven't calculated all the way until the end,

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.920
but you've calculated to the point

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.600
where you have enough in exchange for the sack

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.840
and you think you could play that position.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.280
How do you train chess these days?

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.040
What's, do you practice?

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.760
Do you do deliberate practice?

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.320
I mean, you're in this tough position

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.600
because you're also a creator and educator and entertainer.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.640
So do you try to put in time of like daily practice?

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.920
I don't train chess anymore

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.320
when I'm focusing on creating.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.880
I do if I'm preparing for a tournament.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.520
But back in the day, I would train very tournament,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.160
very seriously for tournaments.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.840
And the way it would work is I do opening preparation

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.000
for a specific tournament

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.520
because that's when you really need

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.480
to have those lines memorized

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:17.760
and you could also prepare for specific opponents.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.800
And I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.080
So those were the two things I would do every single day

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
for a tournament and then mix up the rest

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.040
with like maybe some end games, maybe some positional chess.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.640
So what does tactics preparation looks like?

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.760
Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.720
Yeah, I would just train puzzles

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:39.720
for at least like 30 to 60 minutes or books.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.000
And sometimes you were,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.760
and there's different kinds of puzzles.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.760
One, you could train for pattern recognition

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.800
where you're supposed to go through them very quickly.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.640
And that's just so that when you're playing the game,

01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:51.920
if your mind is tired, it's still keeping track of things

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.240
a little bit more easily.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.160
And then there's where you're practicing your combination

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.400
and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.600
because you have to just calculate a lot.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.720
And it's more like making sure

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.000
that you've trained with that muscle.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.040
But Andrea is actually very good at finding ways to balance

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.320
and still study while also doing content.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.640
You're able to do both?

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640
That's the hard thing.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.720
I was getting very irritated with content

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.240
because I'm very competitive.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.520
I don't like playing chess if I'm losing.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.200
And if you're talking and entertaining,

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.520
you're gonna be losing more games than winning.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.760
So then I started doing more training streams

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.000
where I'd bring on my coach.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.920
And one of the things that I wanted to add

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.560
to Alex's training repertoire,

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.720
so I would do daily puzzles every time I'm streaming,

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:37.560
which helped me a lot, even if it's like,

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.440
there's this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush,

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.480
where you have three minutes

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.400
and you just do puzzle after puzzle

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.560
where they get incrementally harder.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:46.960
And it's just a really good way

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.360
to build your pattern recognition,

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.800
especially when you're rusty.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:51.520
So I would do that till I hit a high score

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.880
and I wouldn't play any blitz

01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.000
until I hit the score that I want.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But that's kind of more like the fun part of chess studying.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.840
The very important one is actually analyzing your losses

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.480
in your tournament games.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.520
And first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.120
and try to see if you can find the better moves.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.440
And then that's when you would check over with a computer

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:13.920
to see if you're right.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.800
So game analysis is also very important,

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800
which I try to do.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.160
I remember to give a shout out,

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.680
I listened to a couple of episodes

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.480
of the Perpetual Chess podcast,

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:24.040
which is pretty good.

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.360
But whatever I listened to,

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:31.360
I think they really focus on teaching people.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.080
How to train?

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.440
Yeah, how to play, how to train,

01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:37.920
all that kind of stuff.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.600
They do like, yeah, I'm looking now, adult improver.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.600
So basically, how do regular noobs get better at chess?

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.040
One of the things, one of the person that said,

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.160
I think he was a grandmaster,

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:54.400
but he said to maximize the amount of time

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.160
you spend every day of like,

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:58.280
basically as you were saying, like suffering.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.920
So it's not about the, like you should be thinking,

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:04.600
you should be doing calculating.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.240
So it's the opposite of what Magnus said,

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.560
like you should be doing a lot of time.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.200
It doesn't matter if what the puzzle is

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.680
or whatever the hell you're doing,

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.720
but you should be like doing that difficult calculation.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:15.680
That's how you get better.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.440
Yeah, it really depends what you're training.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:18.760
Cause I used to think the same,

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.320
but it depends what you're weaker at.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.040
Cause if you're doing the really difficult puzzles,

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.280
you're training for like visualization

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.400
and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:30.080
which maybe you wouldn't get into that as often

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.000
in a regular game,

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.760
because typically you run into like three to four tactics,

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.680
which are actually the easier and more fun ones to solve.

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.240
So it really depends.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.560
And on top of that, as a hobbyist,

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.680
your motivation is very different

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:45.520
than when you're playing from a young age

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.840
and have pretty high competitive ambition.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.280
And a lot of people who are new to chess,

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.560
you could basically work on anything and still improve.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.320
So if you're focusing on something you like,

01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.880
you're probably gonna stick to it more

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.040
and be more consistent,

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:03.480
which I think is more helpful long-term.

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.320
What was the most embarrassing loss of your career?

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:09.840
I had so many flashbacks,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.360
but I'm so glad it's a question for Andrea.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.360
I like that you specified.

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.200
You know, it's funny.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.560
I mean, because you said you're so competitive and like,

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.560
I could tell just even from the way you said it,

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:24.560
that like you hate losing.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.160
Yeah, I mean, that was the reason I hated chess in high school

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.880
cause it'd always be like,

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:32.480
but okay, there's many traumatizing losses

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.800
and you always feel like you're top three,

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.880
you're running for first,

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.680
and then you throw a game you shouldn't.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:40.280
And this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does,

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:44.000
but it's always kids or when I was a high school girl,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.560
it's the younger boys who are really cocky.

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.720
And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.440
and they're yawning and looking around

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.560
when like 90% of the game you were destroying them

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:57.000
and you had this one tiny mistake and now their ego's huge.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:57.960
But I'll never forget,

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.400
I was playing like for a chess scholarship

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.360
and it was tiebreaker for first

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.200
and I think I lost to a 12 year old girl

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.200
who couldn't even use the scholarship,

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.680
but she beat me in one first place

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.520
and she got some other prize.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.000
So yeah, I was losing to that little girl

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.520
who's literally like 2300 now, so makes sense.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.880
Right, you keep telling yourself that.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:22.400
What do you think, do you think Kaspar was feeling that

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.600
when he was playing 13 year old Magnus?

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.120
Like, why?

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.720
As much as it's a beauty of the sport

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.120
that any age can be brilliant, any demographic, anything.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.480
I feel like when you're adults

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.320
and you're paired against the kid,

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.800
it's just hard not to let it get to you.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.920
And it depends, maybe if they're a really sweet kid,

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.840
but most of the times I play kids,

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.960
they're just really arrogant.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.840
And I don't think they do it intentionally

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.800
because they're kids.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.280
I mean, there is a certain etiquette thing

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.200
where like you say yawning and in general.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.040
Like it's not-

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.560
In fact, if you're kids, there's no etiquette.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.840
They don't care.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.560
Yeah, the kids traumatized me too.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.600
I was playing in Vegas and it was not even my opponent.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.400
It was the board next to me.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.360
And the kid was at least 10 years old, 12 max.

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.600
And he was playing against an adult

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.200
and he takes out his hand and he starts doing a fake phone

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.400
to which the kid is studying, sitting across diagonally,

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.600
picks up their banana and starts talking like it's a phone.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.920
And they're just mouthing words

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.680
while their two adult opponents

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.400
are thinking intensely at the game.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.400
And then I see the adult look up,

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.840
look at the kid, just making banana phone

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.120
and the despair in his eyes as he sighs.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:31.960
Yeah.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.360
And they're not even doing it for trash talk.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.200
No, no, no.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:35.040
They're just bored.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:35.880
They're just bored kids.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:37.000
Yes, exactly.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.720
What was the, cause you play a bunch of people

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.440
for your channel.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.560
What was the most like memorable?

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.160
What's the most fun, most intense?

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.120
There's a bunch of fun ones.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.760
You've played kids before, some trash talking kids.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.240
That sounds great.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.880
They trash talk kids.

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.720
Yeah.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.720
It's like losing to a 12 year old

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:59.080
who then starts doing a Fortnite dance.

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.000
Yeah.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.560
So that actually happened?

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.680
That did happen.

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.600
He is a very young master.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.680
I think he became master when he was like nine years old

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.520
or something.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.520
And he's very good at chess and doing a lot of training,

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.720
but he's also incredibly good at trash talking.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.720
And he beat me one game and he stood up

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.720
and he started doing the Fortnite dance.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.360
So, you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:25.320
What is that culture of like street chess players?

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.720
It seems pretty interesting.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:29.480
Like, I don't know.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:31.680
That seems to be celebrating the beauty of the game.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:34.400
It's the trash talking, but also having fun with it,

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.320
but also taking it seriously.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.960
And you've done a few of those.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:39.640
Did you go to New York?

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.320
Yeah, in Union Square Park in Washington Square.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.920
What was that like?

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.000
It's such a unique place.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.800
I haven't seen it anywhere else in the US

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.720
where people are just professional chess hustlers,

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.840
even if they're not necessarily a top player,

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.160
but they play chess every single day.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.280
And so many of them learn chess by themselves

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.200
and never had a professional coach.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.040
So they are quite good at it.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.800
They're also very tight knit.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:07.880
They all know each other.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.400
And it's a very social thing

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:11.360
where you're not just playing chess.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.560
It's the experience of getting to know this person

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.800
who's very much a personality.

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.640
And they talk to you.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.120
They could either give you tips

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.360
or they could be really chatty and talk to you during.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.080
So it's a chess experience rather than just playing a game.

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.200
Do you tell them what your rating is

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.960
or do you just let people,

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.320
like both ways, do you discover how good

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.160
the person actually is?

01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:35.640
Initially, I loved going and not telling people my rating

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:39.080
and just surprising them and winning games.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.760
But now we've gone so many times that they just know us.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.440
So we can't get away with it anymore.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.200
One time, actually, I don't know if I should share this,

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.240
but one time we dressed up as grandmothers

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.720
and we had prosthetics on our face.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.320
And I think they still recognized us.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.720
Yeah, it's probably the,

01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:56.760
there's other components,

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.680
like probably the trash talk and all that kind of stuff.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.280
Actually, no, it was funny.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.640
We were talking like grandmothers,

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.600
but it was the way I held,

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.440
it was the way I held them.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.760
Grandmother talk like,

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:06.600
you don't want to hear this.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:07.440
Back in my day.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.280
No, no, no, no, no, we're not bringing,

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.480
if you want some bon bon.

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.040
We're not bringing this back.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.200
Okay, what were your names?

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.120
What were the code names?

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:14.960
Oh my God.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:16.320
I think it was Edna.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.160
Edna.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.000
And I had a really,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.480
I can't remember the other one.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.760
But it was embarrassing

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.400
because we were walking so slowly

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.640
and Andrea dropped her cane or something at one point.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.840
Then people in the park came to help her.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.680
We felt so embarrassed.

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.520
Sounded like my bonbons.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.920
But yeah, it was funny

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.240
because they didn't know it was us

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:35.640
until he saw the way I reached for my pond.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.240
And he said, the way you held your pond,

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.520
I knew it was you.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.760
It was like such a niche thing.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.560
That was what blew the grandma cover.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.120
Yeah, do you have a style of how you play physically?

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:47.960
Is that recognizable?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.800
I didn't think we did

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.040
until grandma went to play chess, but.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.120
Yeah, I've never thought about that.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.880
Yeah, I think our style is just trash talking now.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.360
Like, style is very,

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.840
if you're talking about style on YouTube and Twitch,

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.840
we definitely have a distinctive style.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.680
What's that?

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.680
What's your distinctives?

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.000
Just talking shit?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.840
Yes.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.280
But not going too far.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.240
No, no, definitely.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.240
That's definitely going to,

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:14.120
if it's us two against each other.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.720
Oh, we trash talk each other so hard.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.560
So brutally.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.760
And I love looking at Andrea

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.000
and watching her little nose scrunch up

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:21.840
as she's annoyed

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.800
and the satisfaction I get when that happens.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.640
How many times have you played

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.320
against each other online, publicly?

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:29.960
I think I've seen a couple of games.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.160
We played a lot of times.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.480
We try not to do it too often

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.400
because it's repetitive,

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.880
but every now and then when we haven't done it for a while,

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:36.920
we'll go at it again.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:37.760
What do you mean repetitive?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.320
Is that implied trash talk right there?

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.760
No, we play similar openings,

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.240
so you just start seeing the same position too often.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.720
It's the same opening against each other every time.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:48.240
Andrea's really good at openings,

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.040
so I just start playing bad openings

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.840
to get her out of her preparation

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.680
because I don't like opening theory very much.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.920
I just like playing the game

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.600
and getting into middle games and end games.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.560
But yeah, typically the only time we're playing each other

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.040
is when we're setting up in the park

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.880
and we don't have opponents yet

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.000
and we need content,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.960
so we just play each other until people show up.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:07.760
But we always put stakes on the line,

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.200
which makes it very interesting.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.000
Because otherwise it wouldn't be fun to play each other

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.120
if there's no stakes.

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.400
Where is the most fun place you've played?

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.440
Is it New York?

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.280
I think so.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.720
And it was actually when we set up in Times Square one night,

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.720
we just brought a table with us and chess.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.280
And it's not even where people usually play chess,

01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.640
but it was so lively.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.000
There were all of the lights out

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.600
and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.800
And it was really one of my favorite streams.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.800
It's just the opposite of the classical chess world.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.720
It's super loud.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.040
There's music, there's cars,

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.720
there's street dancers,

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.440
even some naked people walking around

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.560
who we had to be careful not to get banned.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.240
But I honestly really like the chaotic environments

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:48.480
for chess games,

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.960
because I think it's a good way to break more

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.120
into the mainstream culture

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:52.760
and make it entertaining and appealing

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.400
to anyone who doesn't know anything about chess.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.240
So that's what it is.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.680
And also in an authentic way,

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.040
because it's what we really like about chess

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:01.560
when you're just enjoying the game,

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.320
but also the atmosphere

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.440
and the people who you're playing with.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.880
And that's one of the things that I think you see less

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.440
when you're just thinking of chess

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.880
as a competitive thing.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.480
You've, you mentioned a few other games,

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:16.200
like the Bobby Fischer games,

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.240
the Candidate Smash, the Game of the Century,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.320
which I feel like is a weird game

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.480
to call the Game of the Century

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.920
when there's still a few decades left in the century.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.760
But yeah.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.040
I mean, it wasn't an official thing.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.560
It was just the chess journalists.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.000
It's just like eight on a chess article.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.320
But it's stuck if you look at,

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.000
yeah, no, it did stick.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.760
This is all I do research wise.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:37.000
Because there's,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.560
so that particular one was a 13 year old Fischer

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:44.000
and he did a queen sacrifice.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.280
I wonder, there's that movie Searching for Bobby Fischer.

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
Was that related?

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.520
Cause didn't they have a young,

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.720
somebody who's supposed to be kind of like Bobby Fischer

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:54.520
played by Josh Wadskin?

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.520
Yeah, I think he ended up being an international master.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:59.040
It wasn't based on Bobby Fischer.

01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.280
It was based on another player,

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.600
but I liked how they told it through the lens

01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.800
of being inspired by Bobby Fischer.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.920
Do you remember that game?

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.200
Why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century?

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.360
Was it just journalists being like?

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:12.720
I think part of it was the atmosphere

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.080
where you have the US junior champion

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.240
who's this 13 year old nobody.

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.480
And it's the first time he's playing

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.240
in a very competitive landscape

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.840
against some of the top American players.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.840
And he goes up against an international master.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.600
So somebody who's a lot stronger than he is,

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:32.800
who's played in Olympiads for the American team.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.560
He's having a bad tournament,

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.240
but then he has this one game

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:40.000
where he just shows off his tactical prowess

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.640
and plays incredibly well.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.440
And I don't know if this is true,

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:44.920
but in the paper clippings of it,

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.200
they'd say things like grandmasters were by the board

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.640
and they would say things like,

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:51.080
oh, Bobby is lost in this position.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:51.920
What is he doing?

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.200
But there's this 13 year old kid

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.120
who's just playing incredibly well.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.440
And then that also happened

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:01.160
before Bobby started really rapidly improving at chess.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.200
Not that people knew that,

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.920
but he kind of seemed like a rising star.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.320
So I think the game was beautiful,

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.480
but I also think the idea of a 13 year old kid

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.560
coming out from nowhere

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:12.480
and beating a top American player was very fascinating.

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:13.720
And there was aggressive chess

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.920
and it was interesting ideas.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.120
Yeah, taking big risks.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.000
It's cool to see a 13 year old do that.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.320
Yeah.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.600
What about the,

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:27.320
you mentioned that his match against Mark Taimano

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:31.000
from their 71 candidates match was interesting in some way.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.520
Why is it interesting to you?

01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.160
I'll move 45.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.840
I'm looking at some notes.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.800
This is with the Bishop E3.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.080
I think I know which one you're talking about.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.680
It's, I wouldn't say,

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.560
a lot of these games on these lists,

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:48.000
I think are really great combinations

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.720
that when tactics come into play,

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:52.280
which is what we were talking about,

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.960
but they're very good at exemplifying lessons.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.240
This is why you study famous games

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.840
so you can apply these lessons to your own games.

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.760
I think the main takeaway for this one

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.840
was they were punishing their opponent

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.600
from steering away from opening principles,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.240
which is something that we learned a little earlier

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.160
where he delayed the development of his king

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:17.200
and put his queen out a little bit too exposed.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.960
So Bobby Fischer immediately punished that.

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.360
And then there was just like a beautiful combination

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.880
where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves,

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.720
which was a tactic just winning the game.

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.440
But it only came from punishing those mistakes.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.400
And the mistake being bringing the queen out.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.720
Bringing the queen out and yeah,

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.920
not castling your king right away.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.920
And these were just like opening principles

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.320
that now they're written in books,

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:42.360
but for books you would study these principles

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.480
by studying games.

01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.120
And also I'm looking at some notes.

01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:50.080
His dominance during the candidate's turn

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:52.160
was unprecedented.

01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.560
He swept two top grandmasters.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.640
I mean, that guy's meteoric rise is incredible.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:01.440
Sad that I think at whatever in his 20s,

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.320
he then quit chess.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:07.200
One has to wonder where he could have gone.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:11.200
Yeah, it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.040
so early on.

01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:13.360
And it's also sad, I think,

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:15.720
kind of what ended up happening in his life

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.160
and the slowly going crazier.

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.560
Is there some aspect of chess

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.280
that opens the door to crazy?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.680
Like how challenging it is on you,

01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:29.840
the stress, the anxiety of it, the-

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.800
Isolation and being alone.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:32.640
Yeah.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.760
It's a very lonely sport.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.800
It is, even do you guys, since you both play it,

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.960
it's still lonely, the experience of it?

01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.000
It was when I was competing a lot.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.480
I think the crazy part of it for me

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.480
was how obsessed you can get about a board game

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.080
where you're optimizing your entire life

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:53.120
to beat another person at pushing wooden pieces

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.880
across the board and it doesn't necessarily translate

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.960
to other things.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.920
And the fact that so many people

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.080
spend so much of their life on it,

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.920
but you can also spend so much of your life

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.680
because it's so deep and so interesting.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:09.680
And I mean, I've definitely experienced moments

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.480
where I didn't want to do anything but chess.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.240
And I had that before I went to college

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.640
where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.760
because I went to high school, we moved a lot,

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.160
there was always other things going on.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.720
So I felt like I could never really focus on chess.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:29.640
And the one time I could, by taking a gap year,

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:32.040
I ended up not doing, because my parents really wanted me

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.760
to go to university right away.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.000
But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.640
I don't know if I would have gone back to school.

01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.240
So maybe it wasn't a bad thing.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.840
I also say that's pretty universal.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.200
I think if you want to be the best at anything you do

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.400
or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:47.760
So I don't know if that's only chess.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.920
Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.800
to a balanced social life.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:54.640
That is true.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.480
Like healthy development.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:58.600
Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.040
Yeah, there's something deeply isolating about this game.

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.720
I mean, the great chess players I've met,

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.960
I mean, they, it's like, it's really competitive too.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.960
And there's something that you're almost nonstop paranoid

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.880
about blundering at every level.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:21.520
And that develops a person who's really anxious

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:25.480
about losing versus someone who like deeply enjoys

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:27.840
perfection or winning and so on.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.280
It's just this constant paranoia about losing.

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.720
Maybe I'm like misinterpreting it,

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:36.720
but that creates huge amount of stress

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.960
over like thousands of games, especially in a young person.

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.760
And that blundering is such a painful experience

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.880
because you could be playing a game

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.920
that you've played for five, six hours,

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:53.960
and you have one lapse in focus and you blunder

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:55.600
and you throw the entire game away.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.240
And sometimes not just the entire game,

01:24:57.240 --> 01:24:58.240
but the entire tournament.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:00.520
Now you can't place or do anything anymore.

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:03.920
So you just feel those mistakes so strongly.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.080
Yeah, there's no one to blame but yourself.

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:09.200
Are you guys hard on yourself?

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:11.400
Have you been about losing?

01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.600
Like before you became super famous for streaming,

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.080
where you could be like, well, fuck this,

01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.920
at least I can have fun playing.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.160
So I was really hard on myself,

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.240
and I went to play a tournament in Canada

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.360
to try to qualify for the Olympiad team.

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:28.800
And I was like, well, I'm an adult now.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.600
I'm not gonna feel emotional if I lose.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:34.120
And then I got there on the first day.

01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.160
I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.000
And I-

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:40.840
How long ago was this?

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:44.120
This was like earlier in the year, actually.

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:47.120
And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.520
on the first day.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.520
And I think it was because I had blundered.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.240
And I went back to my room and I was like,

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:53.400
I am not an adult.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.280
I'm not eating.

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.440
I'm not leaving this room.

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.400
I feel terrible.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.080
And I know I shouldn't, but it just cuts so deep.

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:02.280
And then I actually ended up qualifying

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.800
for the Olympiad team, but I didn't wanna play

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:06.400
because I didn't have enough time to train.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.480
And the losses are so painful that I was like,

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.960
it's not worth it.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.560
Yeah, in high school and growing up,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.280
I just remember weekends.

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:16.680
And I think being competitive in any sport,

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.200
again, probably people relate to this,

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.040
which is like spending weekends crying.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.120
And even like Alex said, like punishing yourself

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.920
because you're disappointed in yourself

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.240
because you fight so hard and you prepare and you study.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.280
And you're like, oh, yeah.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:32.880
But that's once again, on the bright side though,

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:37.160
when you're studying so hard and after like a four hour game

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.200
and you actually are on the opposite end and you win,

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.880
you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:45.360
and you're like on a high from the wind.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:47.720
So there's also plus sides or you can turn this around.

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.360
But yeah, like Alex said, like losing after preparing

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:53.440
for something and fighting on hours and hours

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:54.800
is the worst feeling in the world.

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.240
Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:00.000
Yeah, so, you know, wrestling.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.400
I wrestled all through high school and middle school.

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.800
Definitely, so it's an individual sport.

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.760
I did a lot of individual sport, tennis,

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.200
those kinds of things.

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.720
But I think even with wrestling and tennis,

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.480
you're still on a team.

01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.800
You can still like, there's still a camaraderie there.

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:16.960
I feel like with chess, especially you go on your own

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.760
with the tournaments, like you really are alone.

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.440
But I mean, I always personally just had a like

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.360
a very self-critical mind in general.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:26.200
I would not.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:29.680
This is one of the reasons I decided not to play chess

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.480
because I think when I was really young,

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:37.480
I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.640
They were teaching me, they were laying in there

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.920
on the couch, trashed, drinking and smoking.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.960
Sounds like a Russian.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.880
There are now a faculty somewhere in the United States,

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:53.160
I forget where, but he, making jokes,

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:55.920
talking to others, and he would move the pieces

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.600
like he would yell across the room.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.480
And I remember thinking that if a person's able to do that,

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.840
then that kind of world you can live in,

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.280
inside your mind, that becomes a chess board.

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.560
To me, that meant like the chess board is not just out here.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.000
It could be in here and you could do these beautiful,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.880
you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.880
I felt like I had such a strong pull towards that

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.560
where I had to decide either I'm gonna dedicate everything

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:28.440
to this or not.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:30.840
You can't do half-assed.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.080
And then that's when I decided to walk away from it

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.360
because I had so much other beautiful things in my life.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.480
I loved mathematics, I loved,

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:40.920
just everything was beautiful to me.

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:44.720
I thought chess would pull me all in.

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.560
And there was nothing like it, I think,

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.600
in my whole life since then.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.400
I think it's such a dangerous addiction.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.960
It's such a beautiful addiction, but it's a dangerous one,

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.360
depending on what your mind is like.

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:58.960
It reminds me of something I thought of

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:01.400
before I stopped competing as much.

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.440
And I'd look at people and think,

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.200
imagine being so intelligent

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.880
that you could become a grandmaster

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.200
and yet only spending the rest of your life

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.560
being a grandmaster.

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.880
Because it's one of those things where it does require

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.680
a lot of mental power, but by doing chess,

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.760
you're not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.480
Yeah.

01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.040
And not in a way that is bad necessarily,

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:27.440
more an admiration and wondering what else could have been

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.760
because I've just seen people get to these levels

01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.720
of obsession where it's all they wanna do

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.160
and they're grandmasters, but they're not even top players.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.040
So they're never gonna make a living out of it.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.720
They'll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.720
They can't even focus on their competitive chess

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:44.240
because they have to supplement it by teaching

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.440
and doing things they don't like.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.040
And it's just because of how strong of an obsession

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:52.560
it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.360
And I think that's what people are addicted to

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.000
in the self-improvement, but you can get that

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.120
from a lot of other things as well.

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.480
Well, I think for me, what I was inspired by

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:05.480
that stuck with me is that a human being could be so good

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.120
at one thing, but to me, that person on the couch drinking

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:14.160
and so on, I assumed he was the best chess player

01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.000
in the world.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.800
Like to be able to play inside your head,

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.320
it just felt like a feat that's incredible.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:25.000
And so I fell in love with the idea that I hope

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.960
to be something like that in my life at something.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.360
It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing.

01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:34.520
And like life in some sense is a search for the things

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:36.960
that you could be that good at.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.200
I didn't even think about like how much money does it make

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:42.600
or any of that, is can I fall in love with something

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.880
and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it?

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:50.640
And the being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:55.280
Not like not to win because you wanna win a tournament

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.800
or win because like you just wanna be better

01:30:58.800 --> 01:30:59.720
as somebody else, no.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.520
It's for the beauty of the game itself

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:03.560
or the beauty of the activity itself.

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.800
And then you realize that that's one of the compelling

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.640
things about chess.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.480
It is a game with rules and you can win.

01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.560
If you wanna be really damn good in some aspect of life

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.560
like that, it's a harder and weirder pursuit.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.040
Don't you feel like you kind of did that

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.200
with computer science or AI related things?

01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.520
Like getting that level of damn good?

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:31.800
That's one of the cool things about AI and robotics

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:34.120
or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.520
is you can spend until you're 80 doing it.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:38.000
So I'm in the early days of that.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.840
One of the reasons I came to Texas,

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.600
one of the reasons I didn't wanna pursue

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:48.600
an academic career at MIT is I wanna build a company.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.760
And so I'm in the early days of that AI company.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.720
And so it's an open world to see if I'm actually

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:57.680
going to be good at it.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.200
But the thing that's there that I've been cognizant

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:03.160
of my whole life is that I have a passion for it.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:06.680
Something within me draws me to that thing.

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.160
And you have to listen to that voice.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:13.760
So with chess, you're fucked unless you early on

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:16.240
are really training really hard.

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:18.080
I think life is more forgiving.

01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.640
You can be world class at a thing

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.680
after making a lot of mistakes.

01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:29.000
And after spending the first few decades of your life

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.680
doing something completely different.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.440
In chess, it's like an Olympic sport.

01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.640
There's no perfection is a requirement, is a necessity.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:42.920
What do you think is that pursuit for you?

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.480
Why did you decide to stream?

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.880
What drew you?

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:50.080
I like these questions now really getting deep.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.840
Yeah, this is like a therapy session.

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.920
I mean, isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera?

01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:58.240
Well, it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.200
instead of six.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.440
Corrections, six.

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.320
It's more terrifying for me to try to remember

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.240
if I actually turn them all.

01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.640
Like I mentioned to you off mic,

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.880
I'm still suffering from a bit of PTSD

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.560
after screwing up a recording of Magnus.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:19.120
He had to console me because that was the thing

01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.680
is I felt, okay, you wanna build robots.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:28.320
If you can't get a camera to even run correctly,

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.640
how are you gonna do anything else in life?

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.080
Oh no, don't let it spiral like that.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.280
It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.680
and just feeling sorry for myself.

01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:40.800
But I think that feeling, by the way,

01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.160
and the small tangent is really useful.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:46.720
Like I feel like a lot of growing happens

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.680
when you feel shitty as long as you can get out of it.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:53.000
Like don't let it spiral indefinitely,

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.640
but just feeling really, really shitty

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:56.800
about everything in my life.

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.280
Like I was having an existential crisis,

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.960
like how will I be able to do anything at all?

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.560
Like you're a giant failure,

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.000
all those kinds of negative voices.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.880
But I think I made some good decisions

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:10.880
in the week after that.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.200
Do you think you couldn't have made those decisions

01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.920
if you were less hard on yourself?

01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:19.640
Me personally, no, I'm too lazy.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:23.080
Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.400
to go and do what you need.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.240
Yeah, it's not even angry,

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:27.400
it's just upset of being self-critical.

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:29.680
Like also for me personally,

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:33.440
because I don't have proclivities for depression,

01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:39.760
I have a lot more room to feel extremely shitty about myself.

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.800
So if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place,

01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:47.360
like clinically depressed,

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.920
you have to be really, really careful.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.320
You have to notice the triggers,

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:51.800
you don't wanna get into that place.

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:54.200
But for me, just looking empirically,

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:58.240
feeling shitty has always been productive.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.960
Like it makes me long-term happier.

01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.240
Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive,

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.160
it helps me grow, all those kinds of things.

01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:10.160
So I kinda embrace it.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.720
Otherwise, I feel like I will never do anything.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720
I have to feel shitty,

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:16.640
but that's not a thing I prescribe to others.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.800
There's a famous professor at MIT,

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:22.040
his name is Marvin Minsky.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.440
And when he was giving advice about the students,

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.640
he said, the secret to my success

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:33.040
was that I always hated everything I did in the past.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.120
So always sort of being self-critical

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.120
about everything you've accomplished.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.920
Never really take a moment of gratitude.

01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.680
And I think for a lot of people that hear that,

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:42.640
that's not good.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.680
You should take a pause and be grateful,

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.360
but it really worked for him.

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:50.640
So it's a choice you have to make.

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:54.480
It reminds me of the quote, be happy, but never satisfied,

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.640
where you can have a positive spin

01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.640
and still want to improve yourself.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.600
But yeah, like when did you decide

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.240
to take a step in the spotlight,

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:11.200
that terrifying spotlight of the internet?

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.320
It was actually my senior year of college,

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.880
and I was really busy with work and school.

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:21.040
And chess was kind of like this lost love.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.840
And the interesting thing is that

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:24.280
the longer I don't play chess,

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.360
the more I kind of miss playing it casually

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:27.400
and enjoy it more,

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:30.080
because then I start looking at it with fresh eyes.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.040
But I didn't have time to play tournaments.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.960
So I started streaming online because it was more social

01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:38.360
than just playing strangers on the internet

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.160
without knowing anything about who they are.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.440
And I started slowly growing a community

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.520
and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too.

01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.120
So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week,

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.440
every Thursday at 8 p.m.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:55.920
And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy.

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.840
And actually, I, speaking of depression,

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.160
did struggle for it with at least 10 years of my life.

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.120
And it was one of those things where chess and streaming

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:07.320
was such a distraction,

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.880
and it brought me such great joy

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.760
that I just kept doing it because I really, really liked it.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:18.120
And then I was working on something that didn't pan out

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.040
and decided to go and take a risk

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.560
and just stream full-time,

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:26.560
which seemed a little bit weird at the moment, but-

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.200
Was that terrifying, that leap?

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.240
It was terrifying,

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:33.360
but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.600
and they didn't, and the last two hadn't worked out,

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:39.480
but I was like, well, I'll get it eventually.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:43.480
So somehow having failed before and going through failure

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.080
and knowing that it'll be okay

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.440
made me more likely to just try something

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.400
that was a very, very weird job.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.360
Goodbye, camera.

01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:53.280
I saw it die.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.960
Yeah, the camera, we don't need it.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.800
But one of the cameras died.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.720
Luckily, we have another five.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.560
Yeah, I know.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.160
I'm like, this is where this triggers the spiral.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.800
Alexa's gonna go late instead now.

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.480
It's still somehow awake.

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:12.760
Is there advice you can give about the dark places

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.080
gone in your mind, the depression you suffered from,

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.560
how to get out from your own story?

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.480
Whenever I go to those really dark places,

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.720
the scariest thing is that it feels like

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.560
I will never get rid of this feeling,

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.600
and it is very overwhelming,

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:36.680
and I just have to kind of look back over time spans

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:39.880
and remember that every single time I have got through it

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:42.680
and remind myself that it is just temporary,

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.360
and that has been the most helpful thing for me,

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.800
because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:52.640
And then believe, have faith that it's gonna,

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.760
like, this will go away.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:57.040
And take action, obviously, to make sure it goes away,

01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:59.520
and I've also tried to spin it as depression

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:01.280
is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with,

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:03.520
but also one of the biggest motivators,

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:06.440
because if I just am left with my own brain,

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.240
I get very depressed, then I really like working

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:11.800
or focusing on things, so it actually pushed me

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.640
to try to focus on school, try to focus on chess,

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.200
focus on whatever I'm doing.

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.000
And also, if I'm feeling really bad,

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.680
then there's probably something a little bit off,

01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:23.360
and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as,

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.440
okay, this is just a sign that there's things

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:27.760
that could be improved for long term.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.880
What about you, Andrea?

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.400
Have you gone to dark places in your mind?

01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:36.360
I'd say I, my family, like, I see Alex going through this.

01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.840
My mom also has very serious depression.

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:41.560
Luckily, I got the genes where I don't go through

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.640
that serious level of depression that they do.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.280
I'd say mine is much more temporarily.

01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:50.040
So it's more similar to what I was feeling

01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.960
when I was feeling shitty about it.

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.240
Exactly, most periods, yes, exactly,

01:39:54.240 --> 01:39:56.920
but I know that it's not something that's clinical

01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:01.600
and that's just a genetic thing or a mental thing,

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.720
whereas I know it's more serious for my family members.

01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:06.400
And I did relate a lot with you,

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.000
where you're saying where that really pushes you,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.600
and I felt that a lot through content,

01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.280
where you just kind of feel hopeless

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.680
and kind of like an existential crisis

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.240
where I don't like the content I'm doing,

01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.840
and that's what pushes me to like,

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.320
okay, you have no choice but to try something

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.760
that now you're gonna be passionate about

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.880
because otherwise you're gonna be stuck

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.920
in this never-ending cycle.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.360
So it does, it's short-term,

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:29.240
and then it helps me come up with the things

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:31.080
that I enjoy the most content-wise,

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.960
and it also long-term taught me

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:34.480
just how to have a more balanced life,

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.760
like doing small things that make me happier

01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.520
on a daily basis to like working out,

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.840
to eating healthier,

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.200
which I notice when I don't do for weeks,

01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:43.800
I just get a lot more depressed.

01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:48.720
What has playing chess taught you about life?

01:40:48.720 --> 01:40:52.880
Has it made you better at life in any kind of way,

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:54.240
or has it made you worse?

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:56.800
You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.120
that chess is kind of like life,

01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.880
or life is kind of like chess,

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.240
and becoming better at making decisions on the chess board

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:06.120
is gonna make you better at making decisions in life.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:07.520
Is there some truth to that?

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:11.880
I always shy away from these comparisons

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.120
with chess and life,

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:17.680
because yeah, it has both positives and negatives,

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.000
so one thing it really helps develop from an early age

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.160
is having an analytical mind,

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.880
but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis,

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.200
where you've just thought of everything to death,

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:29.520
and you're moving too slowly

01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.320
when you just have to keep going forward

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.560
because there's not a great path ahead.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:38.600
So it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp,

01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:41.400
and then also applying that to other things,

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.040
whereas if instead of playing chess,

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:44.560
you're watching TV or something like that,

01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:47.240
you'd probably end up being less sharp.

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:49.880
Yeah, I used to, in high school,

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.920
I'd always preach like,

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.000
ah, chess transfers to life skills.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:53.840
College essays.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.000
I would teach, I taught chess for juvenile department,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.400
for a special education school,

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:00.880
I'd cite studies in prisons where like,

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.960
oh, playing chess helped them with X,

01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.280
and for your kids, it helps with teamwork

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:07.400
and thinking over life choices,

01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.960
and now that I'm older, I don't believe in any of that BS,

01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:14.960
but I do think that the process of working really hard

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:18.720
at something which takes really long to see results,

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:20.360
and you have to be really dedicated,

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:23.000
and like I remember in high school and in middle school,

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.520
well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends,

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:27.800
and I'd have to be there studying to hours of chess a day,

01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.640
and knowing one day it'll pay off,

01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.640
but for like two, three years, nothing paid off.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:37.320
So kind of learning that type of patience with anything,

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.160
it's like, you know, like getting a real job.

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:42.600
I can't say I ever really worked a real job in my life

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:44.080
since I went straight into streaming,

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.920
and I got to work for myself,

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.000
but I'd say it's what people go to college for,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.600
like they learn how to live in the real world,

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:53.600
and I'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid.

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.360
When you're streaming, when you're doing the creative work,

01:42:58.360 --> 01:42:59.640
do you feel lonely?

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.600
So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the,

01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:06.600
you know, sort of, not quite, but.

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.960
We're very lucky to have each other.

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:11.800
So is that the source of the comfort and the,

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.800
like is there some sense where it's isolating

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.040
to have these personalities,

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.040
they have to always be having fun, being wild, and so on?

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:23.440
Or is it actually the opposite?

01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:24.760
Like is it a source of comfort

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.680
to know that there's so many cool people out there

01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.920
that are giving you their love?

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.520
It started as a source of comfort

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.120
because it started with a very small community

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:35.720
who would be something,

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:38.360
it would be around 200 to 300 viewers,

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:40.520
and you know, only like 30 to 40 of them

01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.200
would actually chat actively.

01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:45.160
So you felt like it was a community, not an audience.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.640
So you like knew them personally almost.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.240
Yeah, exactly, and it was people who were interested

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.280
in chess, and I would really enjoy that.

01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.280
And then as, you know, we started growing bigger,

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:58.800
the audience kind of changed where they're not there

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.960
for you personally, they're there while you're entertaining,

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:05.480
and it changed for me.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:08.160
And I ended up being a lot more self-conscious

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.320
of things online, and started even thinking of myself

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:14.160
more like a product than a human being when I'm online,

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:15.000
because I had to.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:15.840
Brand.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:16.680
Yes, exactly.

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.080
Otherwise you just start taking everything personally

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.480
that people comment about you,

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:23.040
and it's based off a very small clip.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.600
I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism.

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.080
Exactly, and it was like,

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.720
it was a kind of a defense mechanism.

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:32.760
Exactly, and it took time to get enough,

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.640
because even if you have tough skin,

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.240
eventually it gets to you when you're online

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.160
every single day, listening to, you know,

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.080
thousands of people's feedback on you.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.760
I think the loneliest part of being a creator

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.120
is going through burnout,

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:48.720
which everyone is just bound to happen,

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:50.200
which is why I think we're very lucky

01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:52.360
that we have each other, because, right,

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:55.240
it's a numbers game, and you're viral and trendy

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:58.000
at one point, and then you have to fall,

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.080
and then there's months where you're just grinding.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:01.480
And I just come in 10 frames room,

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.000
I'm like, Andrea, we're irrelevant to each other.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:06.880
That's where I'm glad, that's really like the worst part

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.840
of being a creator and figuring out how to get over that hump,

01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:10.720
but it makes me very grateful that I have my sister,

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.880
because I know that I'm not the only person

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:15.640
going through it, and yeah,

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:18.720
I know that most of my creator friends feel very lonely

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.200
in that process, because they don't have someone

01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:22.200
who's their family and their business partner,

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.040
and they're working by each other side by side.

01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:27.840
You kind of tie in your self-worth to your job

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.400
and your content, and maybe even more extremely

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:34.560
than other jobs, because you also are the entire company

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.400
and the entire product, so when things are going well

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.520
or when things are not, you just need to be careful

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:41.640
to not reflect, you're like, oh, I am doing bad,

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:44.160
I am bad, rather than the trends have now changed,

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:45.880
there's outside things, we're gonna keep going,

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:47.720
and this is just the normal waves,

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.640
which is how we think about it now,

01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.280
and also just about, are we enjoying this?

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.400
Is this what we wanna make?

01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.240
But we were stuck in the camp for a while

01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:00.440
when we 10x'd our viewership after the pandemic,

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.240
because people were home and playing chess,

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:04.400
and then, of course, that dropped by like 70%,

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.600
and then you see that and you're trying your best,

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.960
and you just kind of have to deal with it

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:11.000
and be like, okay, I'm just gonna keep persevering,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.640
and maybe it'll get better.

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:17.120
That's so fascinating, I mean, this is a struggle

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:22.120
of sorts in the 21st century of how to be an artist,

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:25.360
how to be a creator, how to be an interesting mind

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:27.160
in response to this algorithm.

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.440
I'm telling you, turning off views and likes is really good.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:32.880
I don't look at Twitch views for that reason,

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.680
and I get obsessed with the numbers too,

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.160
and I know Andrea does, but for me,

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.560
what I try now is to be more focused in the moment,

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.400
but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.640
So you just, you get, you have fun with it.

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:45.480
Like, ooh, number one.

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:47.440
I'm too much of like a given

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.760
to the temporary satisfaction, like I like seeing,

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.800
I like knowing that if something happens right now,

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.160
viewership's gonna boost by a couple hundred,

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.200
and seeing that I'm right, of course.

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.240
But what about when the viewers start dropping it?

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:00.600
Exactly, well, and I always,

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.760
like you just have this intuition now,

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:05.000
but I think also the reason that it doesn't affect me

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.880
so much is when we first started our content journey,

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.120
we were only Twitch streamers,

01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.320
and we, our livelihood, were based on Twitch viewers,

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.440
but now I've learned how to recycle that content

01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:18.840
into YouTube and shorts and other things,

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.320
where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly,

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.760
there's so many more things you can do

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.840
that also just have a much larger output,

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.840
so it doesn't get to me as much as it did.

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.720
Do you ever feel that with your podcasts,

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.400
or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start?

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.240
No, so there's a million things to say there.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.240
So one is there's a reason I stopped taking a salary

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.240
at MIT and moved to Texas,

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.160
is I wanted my bank account to go to zero

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:48.720
because I do my best with my backing against the wall.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.360
So one of the comforts I have is I don't care

01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:53.080
if this podcast is popular or not,

01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.120
I want it to not be popular,

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.800
so I don't want it to make money.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:47:57.640
You're failing, Lex.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:00.320
Yeah, I want to, I mean, I just do best

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:03.480
when I'm more desperate.

01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.880
That's like one thing to say.

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.640
Seems like a reoccurring theme

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.080
with how you filled up your greatest work,

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.560
which is honestly very respectable.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:12.400
Yeah, so.

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.200
Don't even tell me.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.120
Thank you, that's just like.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.520
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:20.440
Thank you for finding the silver lining

01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:23.160
for not healthy mental state.

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.560
But the other thing is I was very conscious,

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:29.720
just like with chess and those kinds of things,

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.120
that I love numbers and I would be,

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:37.600
if I paid attention, if I tried to be somebody

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.560
at their best, like Mr. Beast,

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.880
who really pays attention to numbers,

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.040
I would just not, I'd become destroyed by it.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.760
The highs and the lows of it.

01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.720
And I just don't think I would be creating

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:54.240
the best work possible.

01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:57.960
But one of the, I mean, one of the big benefits

01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.760
of a podcast is listeners.

01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.800
And there's an intimacy with the voice.

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:06.520
And I think that is much more stable

01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.920
and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube.

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.160
YouTube is a fickle mistress.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.480
It's a weird drug that like, it really wants you.

01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:20.080
Very addicting feedback loops.

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.440
When you have a video that's number one out of 10,

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:25.840
oh my God, the adrenaline you get.

01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:28.680
And then the thing I really don't like also

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.680
is the world will introduce you as a person

01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:39.080
that has a video on YouTube with some X number of views.

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.320
Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:45.480
Because they associate it with having done a good job.

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.240
Because that's what people think views are,

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.160
even if it's not.

01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.440
Right, and primarily because they don't have

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:53.680
any other signal of what's a good job.

01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:56.160
I think the much better signal is people

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.040
that are close to you, your family, your colleagues,

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:00.760
that say, wow, that was cool, I listened to that,

01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.680
that was really, I didn't know this,

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:05.760
this was really powerful, this was really moving and so on.

01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:08.040
But definitely I'm terrified of numbers.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.680
Because I feel like, just like I said,

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.720
I'd rather be a Stanley Kubrick, right?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
You'd rather create great art, not to be pretentious,

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.760
but the best possible thing you can create.

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.760
Whatever the beauty that's, the capacity

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:28.520
for creating beauty that's in you,

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.760
I would like to maximize that.

01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.440
And I feel like, for some people like Mr. Beast,

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:34.240
I think those are perfectly aligned.

01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:37.720
Because he just loves the most epic thing possible.

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:38.720
But not for everybody.

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:39.880
I think there's a lot of people

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.400
for whom that's not perfectly aligned.

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:44.840
And so I'm definitely one of those.

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:46.320
And I'm still really confused

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.120
why anybody listens to this anyway.

01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:53.000
But that's also something I guess you're trying to find.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:54.280
You're trying to figure out.

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:58.200
I get very afraid of ever becoming someone

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.160
who just makes junk food content,

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.680
where you can't stop while you're in the moment,

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.400
and it has all of your attention.

01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:08.160
But when you're done, it didn't really bring

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.760
any value to your life,

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.960
which is something that I think the algorithm

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.280
still does really reward.

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:16.800
And making sure that as we are learning

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:18.200
how to create better content,

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:21.320
it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long-term.

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:25.160
Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people.

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:27.960
Yeah, those are the best.

01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:30.200
When I get messages from people who are like,

01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:33.200
I played you a year ago, and my rating was 1,400,

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.520
and now I'm 1,900, I'd like to challenge you again.

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:38.120
And it's a 14-year-old writing a former email.

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:41.120
Those things are always very, very fun to get.

01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.080
Even just outside of chess, it's just empowering to see,

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.720
like for young women too, to see that kind of thing.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.080
I mean, you guys are being yourself

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:51.880
and making money from being yourself

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.880
and having fun and growing as human beings,

01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:57.680
which I think is really inspiring for people to see.

01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.320
So in that sense, it's really rewarding.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:01.800
And then the way I think about it is

01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:06.440
there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:09.040
so that you get the,

01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:13.320
kind of like Mr. Beast does with philanthropy, right?

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:16.200
The bigger Mr. Beast becomes, the more effective he is

01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.360
at actually doing positive impact on the world.

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.320
So those things are tied together.

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:25.440
But of course, with podcasts, you guys,

01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:28.120
well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things,

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:31.960
but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.440
What kind of person,

01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.680
what kind of human being do you want to be?

01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:39.880
Because you're actually becoming a person

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:44.880
and a set of ideas in front of the public eye

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.480
and you have to ask yourself that question really hard,

01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:51.240
like really seriously, because if you're doing stuff

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.240
in private, you have the complete luxury to try shit out.

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.080
Right.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:52:59.160
I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out

01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:01.760
because the internet can be vicious and punishable

01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:04.240
the internet can be vicious and punishing you

01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.640
for trying shit out.

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:07.640
And do you think that's sometimes a bad thing

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.040
where you have less freedom to make mistakes?

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:12.840
Yeah, you have two choices.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:15.320
So one, you put up a wall and say,

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.720
I don't give a shit what people think.

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:18.560
I don't like doing that

01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:20.200
because I like being fragile to the world

01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.320
and keeping my sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve.

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:26.040
Or the other one, yeah, you have to be,

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.560
you have to actually think through what you're gonna say.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.760
You have to think of like, what do I believe?

01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:38.680
You have to be more serious about what you put out there.

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:41.400
It's annoying, but it's also actually,

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:43.640
you should have always been doing that.

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.600
You should be deliberate with your actions and your words.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:50.560
But I don't know, it's a,

01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:54.040
but some of it, it's such a balance

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.760
because some of my favorite people are brilliant people

01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:00.320
that allow themselves to act ridiculous

01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:01.880
and be silly.

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:03.760
Elon Musk, who's become a good friend,

01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.400
is the silliest human of all.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.680
I mean, he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on,

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.800
but allows himself to be silly.

01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.600
And that's also inspiring to people.

01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.440
Like, you don't have to be perfect.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:18.240
You don't have to, you can be a weird,

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.880
a giant weird mess and it's okay.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.560
So it's a balance.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:25.000
I think when you start to delve into political topics,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.200
into topics that really get tense for people,

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.280
then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate.

01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:33.320
But it's also wise to stay the hell away

01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:35.400
from those topics in general.

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:36.760
Like I mentioned to you offline,

01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.800
somebody I have been debating whether I want to talk to

01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:42.040
or not is Karyakian on the chess board

01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:45.080
because chess is just a game,

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.400
but throughout the history of the 20th century,

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.640
it was played between the Russians and the Americans

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:56.320
and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war.

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:57.880
And those are interesting.

01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:01.480
Those are interesting conversations to be had

01:55:01.480 --> 01:55:03.240
at the Olympics and so on.

01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.560
It's not just a game.

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:05.800
It's some sense.

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:07.080
It's like a mini war.

01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.600
And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him or not

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.440
and those kinds of things,

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:14.400
you have to make those kinds of decisions.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:16.080
For now, you guys are not playing chess

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.880
with Donald Trump or Obama or so on.

01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:20.880
We are not right now, no.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:22.160
How long is the stream?

01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:23.240
Like a few hours, right?

01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:24.840
Now there are two to three hours.

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.040
When I was first streaming,

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:29.200
I'd stream for like six hours a day,

01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.400
at least usually.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:33.160
Yeah, for like six to seven days a week.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.840
Are you doing just like a talking one?

01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:38.240
No, I would be playing chess the entire time while talking.

01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:41.280
And when I started streaming,

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.440
that's kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch.

01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:47.360
You're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there.

01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.200
It's not about making the best content.

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.480
It's about letting people feel

01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:53.400
like they're hanging out with you

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.800
and just being on as much as you can.

01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.120
I ended up feeling very burnt out

01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.440
because it's hard to be your best self

01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440
when you're in front of a camera for that long

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:06.600
because you do get scared of going into places

01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:07.520
where you want to learn,

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.480
but you might not be the best in

01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.960
because it's harder to learn in public

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:12.120
than do something that like,

01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:14.880
yeah, we're better than 99% of our viewers at chess.

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:16.480
So that's a lot less scary

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:19.120
than trying to play a game that you're bad at

01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.280
or discuss topics that you're interested in.

01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:26.360
Yeah, be, have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something.

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.200
Right.

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:28.880
Yeah, which is where the fun is

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.080
and you get to learn together,

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:32.600
but people will punish you for it on the internet.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:35.960
What about you, Andrea?

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.280
Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning,

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.760
when we were grinding a lot,

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:43.040
you don't really even have time for much of a private life

01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:45.520
because you're streaming every hour of your life

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.120
and people want it, like the appeal of streamers,

01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.560
it's called like being parasocial

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.080
where you feel like they're your friend

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.600
and they like it because they want you

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.120
to share everything about your life.

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.880
Really the main challenge for me at first

01:56:59.880 --> 01:57:03.840
when trying to prioritize quantity over quality,

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:05.440
which we're not doing anymore,

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.680
was realizing that I can't turn everything

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.800
I'm interested in and every passion into content.

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.120
Before I'm like, well, I must stream more,

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:16.920
but I like music and I like playing piano

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.200
and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:22.000
And then I try to live stream all of it

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.680
and that's just, at some point it's like,

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:27.520
just enjoy your time off for those hobbies

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.920
and prioritize what you're good at

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.680
because that's just gonna be better for the channel overall.

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:34.360
So that was a learning lesson for sure.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.520
It's nice because there are some intersections

01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.920
when I have tried new things that I really enjoy

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.760
and it pays off, but that's more less often.

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.520
So it's more like you can be yourself,

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.680
but only specific parts of yourself online

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:50.760
and the rest, sometimes it's nice to just keep private

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:55.760
and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom.

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.880
See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.000
on podcasts as in private life.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.880
I really don't like hiding anything.

01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:08.640
But you're also a generalist, right?

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:10.320
Where you have people with all topics.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:13.560
For us, we built our audience off of very specific things.

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.120
So people sometimes feel like,

01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.040
even at the start when we started playing Less Chess,

01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.920
they're like, I subbed for chess.

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:21.000
Why are you not playing chess?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.480
Exactly, people are tuning in

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.040
for an interesting conversation on a bunch of topics.

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:27.040
So the more you are yourself, the better it is.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.120
But it is very hard when you build your brand

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:31.920
on one type of gaming content.

01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:33.000
Build your brand.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.480
But yeah, the way you become a generalist

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:39.000
is you slowly expand.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
It's like expand to checkers.

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:47.560
I guess that's like a downward.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.640
Maybe poker.

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:50.040
Poker, yeah, exactly, poker.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.960
But also just the ideas, the space of ideas.

01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.320
And then one of the cool things about chess

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.480
is when you're talking over the chessboard,

01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.960
it's a kind of podcast, you know?

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:02.760
That is actually an idea we've had with playing chess

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:05.440
while also doing a podcast and talking with people.

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.760
It's kind of like an icebreaker

01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:09.000
where you're also focusing on the game at the same time.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.840
But we are slowly evolving and we're doing more things.

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:15.080
One thing we wanted to do is spend less time

01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:16.880
in front of the computer.

01:59:16.880 --> 01:59:18.120
So now we're doing a chess travel show

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.440
where we go to different countries

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:20.840
and look at the chess culture.

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.080
So it actually feels like we're doing things

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:26.000
that we would want to do and explore anyway.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.560
And maybe it's not as much in the idea space,

01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:31.600
which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time,

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:34.760
but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:36.000
that we actually want to do.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.640
Where do you look forward to going?

01:59:37.640 --> 01:59:41.320
We're going to Romania on September 9th.

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.320
And I think this is the most exciting for me

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.920
because we're going back to the country

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.880
where our entire family's from,

01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:51.320
where our grandmother taught our dad

01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:52.960
who taught us how to play chess.

01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:54.960
It has a very strong chess culture.

01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:58.920
So it'll be very unique to go back and see

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.600
how everything is when we haven't been back

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.640
for a very long time.

02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:04.680
And for Romanians, it's very rare

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:07.880
when there's a famous Romanian who accomplishes something,

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:09.080
which is why right now,

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.840
Andrew Tate's the most famous Romanian.

02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:12.680
But he's banned, so we're at this spot.

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:13.680
Exactly.

02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:17.440
And there's something very special about Romanian pride.

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:20.320
And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US,

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.160
it's just an amazing connection.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.680
And I hear the way my dad talked about,

02:00:24.680 --> 02:00:28.600
for example, Nadia, who was a famous Romanian gymnast.

02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.200
And he's like, yeah, Romania, we sucked at everything,

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:34.600
but when she won the Olympics for gymnast,

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:36.480
every kid on the street was doing gymnastics

02:00:36.480 --> 02:00:38.480
because it's very rare that they make it

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.520
to that level of success.

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.880
And I was thinking that we're super successful,

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.800
super famous, but it is really cool

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.120
to meet other Romanians through chess

02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:45.920
because it's a very special bond.

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:50.400
Yeah, you feel like it's a community and people belong.

02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:53.320
Yeah, you can't get that anywhere else.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.560
Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him,

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:59.680
Andrew Tate, you're both women, successful women,

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:01.200
you're both creators.

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:03.760
So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody

02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:06.200
that has become exceptionally successful

02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.360
at galvanizing public attention,

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.640
but he's also, from many perspective, a misogynist.

02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:16.720
So let me ask a personal question.

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.120
Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:24.480
How would you feel as a fan, somebody,

02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:29.400
I'm talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez,

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:32.240
and the next episode is with Andrew Tate?

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:34.560
I think it's a double-edged sword,

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.840
and most of these things are not as black and white

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:41.280
as they seem, because on one hand,

02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:43.320
I don't agree with his beliefs,

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.880
and I think he's said a lot of things that are very hurtful

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:49.440
and that influence people's opinions.

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:54.800
At the same time, talking to someone through that

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:57.120
and trying to get to the root of it

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.000
and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.600
to maybe change the opinion of people

02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:06.800
who have been so influenced by him towards something

02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.960
that is maybe more understanding towards women

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:12.440
or things like that could do some good,

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.200
but at the same time, platforming someone like that

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:17.600
and giving them more attention also signals

02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.080
to other people who have a platform that it's okay.

02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.560
So it's kind of weighing the pluses and the minuses,

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.000
and it's a very tough decision because it's not clear.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.240
And the thing about the internet,

02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.440
you make the wrong decision, you're gonna pay for it.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.280
Right.

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:34.640
That's the thing, like personally,

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.960
and it is funny, I think the whole way he rose to fame

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:40.400
is just a growth hack, and I've seen other people do it

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.680
where you just say kind of,

02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.680
I don't, honestly, I don't really listen to his content

02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:46.960
because I just find it so dumb,

02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:49.600
but I think he knows that by saying the dumbest,

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.840
most controversial things, that's a quick rise to fame.

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:56.480
And I think surface level, he can really hold it up,

02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:58.600
but that's why I would honestly enjoy tuning

02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:00.760
into a conversation where you're really breaking down

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:02.160
to the core of those beliefs.

02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:04.640
And I think the young kids who look up to him,

02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:06.880
and when you actually hear someone challenging it,

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.120
could actually be helpful for people,

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:12.320
but at the same time, it's a lot of bad publicity,

02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.960
people see your podcast, they see, wow,

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:16.040
if they don't know you,

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:17.600
and they don't know why you're interviewing him,

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.920
and they don't listen, they'll see that,

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:22.320
and then 100% think it's for the other reason.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.200
But I'm also afraid of a society

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.720
where you can't have discourse

02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:29.000
with people you disagree with.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.120
And even though I don't like Andrew Tate,

02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.840
I think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms

02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:36.880
is kind of scary because it sets a precedent,

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:38.160
and you always have to ask yourself,

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.640
would this be ethical if I was on the other side?

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:42.600
And even things with a president like Trump,

02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:45.680
even if, let's say, you're somebody who was on the left,

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:47.600
if that would have happened to a leftist president,

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:48.440
how would you feel?

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:49.840
Would you think that's morally ethical?

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:54.080
So that is something that I think is important.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.400
We try to find ways to have conversations

02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:59.080
and reach some mutual understanding,

02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:02.120
and try, instead of just amplifying the worst

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.560
about every human being.

02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:07.600
Well, so one of the major reasons I'm struggling with

02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:11.600
is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women.

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.320
I think it's also, a lot of women reached out to me saying,

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.920
like, it is what it is,

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.120
but they're inspired when a female guest is on.

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.280
And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate,

02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.480
even if I have a really hard-hitting,

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:28.440
I think it could be a very good conversation.

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:34.480
That lessens the likelihood that a brilliant,

02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:36.560
powerful female will go on the show.

02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.800
Because they'll never watch it,

02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:41.520
but the thing we do in this society

02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.720
is we put labels on each other.

02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:46.760
Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists.

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:53.120
I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:56.800
over an N-word controversy earlier in the year,

02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.720
and Joe's a good friend of mine,

02:04:59.320 --> 02:05:01.680
said that I stand with Joe, that he's not a racist,

02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:02.960
or something like that.

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:06.480
And within certain communities,

02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:09.880
I'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists, right,

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:12.400
or a racist myself, that kind of thing.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.640
And we put labels without ever listening to the content,

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:17.680
without ever sort of, actually,

02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:19.560
just even the very simple step,

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:21.720
or it seems to be difficult, of like,

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:27.240
taking on the best possible interpretation

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:28.600
of what a person said,

02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:30.480
and giving them the benefit of the doubt,

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.920
and having empathy for another person.

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.360
So you have to play in this field

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.720
where people assign labels to each other,

02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:39.400
and it's difficult.

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:41.320
But ultimately, I believe, I hope,

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:45.040
that good conversations is a way

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:46.800
to like, a greater understanding for people

02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.040
to grow together as a society,

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:51.480
and improve, and learn the lessons,

02:05:51.480 --> 02:05:52.440
the mistakes of the past.

02:05:52.440 --> 02:05:54.480
But you also have to play this game

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.840
where people just like putting labels on each other,

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.560
and canceling each other over those,

02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:01.600
or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump,

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:04.840
he must be a far-right Nazi,

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.240
or the opposite,

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:11.000
that this person said something nice about the vaccine,

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.760
he must be a far-left, whatever,

02:06:13.760 --> 02:06:18.760
because, apologist for whatever, for Fauci.

02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:23.200
Or most of us, I think, are ultimately in the middle.

02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:25.520
It's a weird, it's a weird thing.

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:28.080
But I think, and it's also painful on a personal level,

02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:33.560
people have written to me about things like single words,

02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.680
half sentences that I've said about

02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:39.920
either Putin or Zelensky,

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:42.720
where they have hate towards me because of what I said.

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.280
Both directions.

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:48.640
I've now accumulated very passionate people

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:52.160
that some call me a Putin apologist,

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.480
some call me a Zelensky apologist.

02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:58.760
And it hurts to, given how much I have family there,

02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:00.960
how much I've seen of suffering there,

02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:02.640
and to carry that burden over time

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:04.600
and not let it destroy you is tough.

02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:07.960
So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that

02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:09.920
when you have conversations?

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:13.160
Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two,

02:07:13.160 --> 02:07:14.240
where it's not that burden?

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.160
We're not controversial.

02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:17.680
Or you're interesting, you're fascinating,

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:21.040
you're inspiring, you're like fun, you know?

02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.440
Not all those difficult things

02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:25.720
that come with more difficult conversations.

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.240
Right, but somebody has to be making

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:32.520
those difficult decisions and challenging the notions

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:35.240
that we should cancel someone

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:37.680
just for slightly disagreeing with us.

02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:40.680
And it's very hard to take that on personally.

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.280
And I think that's a huge part of it.

02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.280
When you know it's something you're doing

02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.400
for the right reasons,

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.200
and you're getting a lot of people coming

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:50.340
and misinterpreting it, it's very painful.

02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.100
But I think you have to ask yourself long-term

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:56.700
if when you made that decision,

02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:59.260
you ultimately thought it would be better or worse

02:07:59.260 --> 02:08:01.580
for your listeners to know that conversation,

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.700
and then if you can sleep with it at night, take the risk.

02:08:04.700 --> 02:08:07.180
Yeah, actually when I talk to people that,

02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:08.660
especially astrophysicists,

02:08:08.660 --> 02:08:10.660
and you realize how tiny we are,

02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:13.460
how incredible, how huge the universe is,

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:15.700
it doesn't matter, you can do anything.

02:08:16.060 --> 02:08:19.020
You can walk around naked, talk shit to people,

02:08:19.020 --> 02:08:22.620
do whatever the hell, and actually in modern social media,

02:08:22.620 --> 02:08:24.220
people will just forget.

02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:26.180
It's ultimately liberating.

02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:29.620
Just try to do, at least from my perspective,

02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.860
the best possible thing for the world you can,

02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.340
take big risks, and it doesn't matter.

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:36.740
And that's the other thing with being canceled nowadays,

02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:40.460
because everyone's attention is much more shortsighted,

02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:43.500
you can get canceled and then it'll blow over and through.

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:46.140
You can get canceled and then it'll blow over in three days,

02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:48.420
and you actually see things like this on Twitch very often,

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:51.260
where people just have bursts of outrage,

02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:52.380
and they come into your chat,

02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:54.100
and they're all spamming and saying mean things,

02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:55.660
and then three days after,

02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:57.940
and of course they're not actually ever serious things,

02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:00.060
they're usually like things clipped of any streamers

02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:01.180
in like their worst moments,

02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:03.860
but then people forget about it pretty soon after.

02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:06.940
So you're able to accept that,

02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:09.900
like when somebody's being shitty to you for a day?

02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:12.780
Yeah, I mean, I still get sometimes emotional about it,

02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:14.220
especially when I'm like, oh wow,

02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:16.740
like these things are being said are not true,

02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:19.300
or like this was clearly taken out of context,

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:22.460
but I've just accepted that it's part of the job,

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:25.100
and if I am trying my best,

02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:29.260
and I am trying things with as good intentions as possible,

02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:31.100
then I just try to learn every time that happens,

02:09:31.100 --> 02:09:32.900
and be like, okay, what could I do better,

02:09:32.900 --> 02:09:34.820
and what is just part of the job?

02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:37.220
Well, let's start some controversy.

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:39.420
Who's the greatest chess player of all time?

02:09:40.220 --> 02:09:43.300
Is it Magnus Carlsen, is it Garry Kasparov,

02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:45.340
is it somebody else, Bobby Fischer?

02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:48.300
Do you have a favorite, Alex?

02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:50.780
So whenever I hear this question,

02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:53.700
I interpret it in a very specific way,

02:09:53.700 --> 02:09:57.300
where it's not who was the most talented chess player,

02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.260
or who had the most impact on the chess world,

02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:02.860
but who is the greatest at playing chess?

02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:05.420
Where if you were putting all of these players

02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:07.980
at their peak, who would be the best?

02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:11.460
And we're kind of living in a world

02:10:11.460 --> 02:10:14.140
where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs,

02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:17.260
and their tools make them a lot more powerful.

02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:22.020
And the computer is the most powerful tool for chess

02:10:22.020 --> 02:10:25.060
that we've ever witnessed, and the top players now,

02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:28.060
someone like Magnus Carlsen or Garry Kasparov,

02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:32.740
if they were going to go towards people like even Lasker,

02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:35.140
or Bobby Fischer back in the day,

02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.060
Lasker, he was world champion for 27 years,

02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.100
he was the best in his field by far,

02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:41.620
but would he be able to stand up to someone

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:44.220
like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?

02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:45.580
I don't think so.

02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:49.700
So most chess players have said Garry Kasparov,

02:10:49.700 --> 02:10:52.460
and I think even Magnus has said that in the past,

02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:55.340
but I like to think of it as Magnus in his peak,

02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:57.620
and Garry at his peak, and because Magnus was able

02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.380
to live more in a computer era,

02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:02.580
I feel like so far he's the greatest of all time.

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:04.380
And some studies say things like how there's

02:11:04.380 --> 02:11:06.980
rating inflation, but I looked into some of them,

02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.980
and they basically calculated people's play over the years,

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:14.340
and it seems that there hasn't been inflation,

02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:15.340
people are just getting better,

02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:18.300
and I think it's because you have better tools at chess.

02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:21.140
And also one of the cases, what's your?

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:24.540
I was gonna say, I disagree with that.

02:11:24.540 --> 02:11:26.460
Good, make it interesting.

02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:31.460
I think I would judge the greatest player of all time

02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:33.660
in relative to the time that they lived in,

02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:36.700
Magnus, although he is technically

02:11:36.700 --> 02:11:38.460
the strongest chess player in history,

02:11:38.460 --> 02:11:41.980
that is because he had computers to study chess with.

02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:45.660
And of course, if you compare him to like Garry Kasparov,

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:48.820
he plays most like Stockfish, but Garry Kasparov,

02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:52.700
at his time, he beat more players of his skill level

02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:55.300
than Magnus did, and Magnus loses more often.

02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:57.660
He also, of course, held the belt for 20 years more.

02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.120
So I'd say actually, because Garry lacked the help

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.120
of computers to study chess and overall performed better

02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.280
against players of his skill level,

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.320
I think he would be number one.

02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.920
Nice, yeah, but I mean, the case that people make

02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:16.400
for Magnus on many, I mean, what Alex said,

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.120
but also Magnus plays a lot, and he doesn't,

02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:25.000
he plays a lot of blitz, bullet, and like he puts,

02:12:25.880 --> 02:12:29.600
he gets drunk, and like he's really putting himself out there

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.520
and in all kinds of conditions,

02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:33.680
and he's able to dominate in a lot of them.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:35.760
We get to see many of the like losses,

02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.060
or blunders, and all that kind of stuff,

02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:39.040
because he just puts himself out there.

02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:42.540
And I think Kasparov was much more like-

02:12:42.540 --> 02:12:44.200
Never saw him play drunk, right?

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:45.040
I just don't know.

02:12:45.040 --> 02:12:47.140
And it's very focused on the World Championship,

02:12:47.140 --> 02:12:51.160
it's very like, very limited number of games,

02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:52.600
and very focused on winning.

02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:56.160
And so there's some aspect to the versatility,

02:12:56.160 --> 02:12:59.420
the aggressive play, the fun, all of that,

02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:02.820
that I think you have to give credit to,

02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:07.820
in terms of just the scope, the scale of the variety

02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.780
of genius exhibited by Magnus.

02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:12.340
And he might not even be done yet.

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:14.700
I don't know if he'll ever hit 2900,

02:13:14.700 --> 02:13:16.700
but we can't judge yet,

02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:19.020
because he's not at the peak of his career potentially.

02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:20.940
What do you think about him not playing World Championship?

02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:23.120
Isn't that like, isn't that wild?

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.860
The entirety of the history of chess in the 20th century,

02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:27.780
going like, meh.

02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:31.740
That's walking away from this one tournament

02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:34.340
that seems to be at the center of chess.

02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.420
What do you think about that decision?

02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:41.460
I mean, you can't help but be disappointed as a chess fan

02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:43.540
who wants to see the best player in the world

02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:44.980
defend his title.

02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.700
But I also understand it on a personal level,

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:51.380
and not feeling as satisfied

02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:53.820
when you're going to the World Championship

02:13:53.820 --> 02:13:55.740
and having to defend against people

02:13:55.740 --> 02:13:57.340
who are less strong than you.

02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:59.580
And also imagine winning World Championships

02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:01.700
and not feeling a joy out of that.

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.700
So maybe by not doing that

02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:07.180
and focusing instead on a goal like 2900,

02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:09.180
he'll be more likely to accomplish it

02:14:09.180 --> 02:14:12.500
because he's focusing on what actually motivates him

02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:13.540
to play chess.

02:14:13.540 --> 02:14:18.540
But I do think that it will hurt how we judge

02:14:18.980 --> 02:14:20.500
the next World Champion.

02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:23.900
I think it won't change him being the best player

02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:24.980
in the world.

02:14:24.980 --> 02:14:27.340
And for someone to replace him,

02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:29.940
even let's say like Nepo versus Ding,

02:14:29.940 --> 02:14:32.940
even if one of them win and write on some stance,

02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:34.580
it does lower the merit

02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:37.740
because now who has the World Chess Championship title

02:14:37.740 --> 02:14:39.660
isn't actually the best player in the world.

02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:41.740
And that has happened before in the past,

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.500
but still gonna take them the same effort to prove

02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:48.140
when they would pass him like 10, 20 years

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:49.500
to become stronger than Magnus.

02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:51.260
So I don't think it changes the skill level

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:54.220
that it takes to become the best chess player in the world.

02:14:54.220 --> 02:14:56.780
I think for chess fans, it's very disappointing,

02:14:56.780 --> 02:14:58.740
but I think in the overall like grand scheme

02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:01.700
of like the public view to people who don't really,

02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:04.740
so like what breaks the popular culture?

02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:08.340
And you think of what names people know

02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:10.660
who don't play chess like Bobby Fischer did it.

02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:12.340
Most people know Casper over Magnus.

02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:15.500
It takes the same ability and talent and that doesn't change.

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.020
I think it does change though

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.380
if you're playing a player who's not as strong.

02:15:20.380 --> 02:15:22.340
But I see your point as well

02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:23.900
and I know we differ on this.

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:26.820
I heard you ask Magnus, but what is your take on it?

02:15:30.020 --> 02:15:33.980
Well, listen, his answer is kind of brilliant,

02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:37.460
which he's not saying he's bored

02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:39.060
of the world championship.

02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:41.700
He's bored of a process

02:15:41.700 --> 02:15:44.380
that doesn't determine the best player.

02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:47.140
Like, and it's too exciting inducing to him

02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:50.060
to have a small number of games.

02:15:50.060 --> 02:15:54.780
He doesn't mind losing, which is really fascinating,

02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:58.620
to a better player or somebody who is his level.

02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:03.620
He's more anxious about losing to a weaker player

02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:07.140
because of the small sample size.

02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.820
Now, if like poker players had that anxiety,

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:11.620
they would never play at all, right?

02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:13.340
That's the world series of poker.

02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:17.580
You get to lose against weaker players all the time.

02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:19.380
That's the throw of the dice.

02:16:19.380 --> 02:16:21.940
But that's an interesting perspective

02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:25.100
that he would love to play 20, 30, 40 games

02:16:25.100 --> 02:16:26.100
in the world championship,

02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.140
but then he would enjoy it much more.

02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:29.940
And also play shorter games

02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:34.580
because they emphasize the like pure chess,

02:16:34.580 --> 02:16:35.860
actually being able to,

02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:41.180
like much more variety in the middle game

02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:42.700
just to see a bunch of chaos

02:16:42.700 --> 02:16:43.940
and see how you're able to compute,

02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:46.460
calculate and intuition, all that kind of stuff.

02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:48.140
I mean, that's beautiful.

02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:51.580
I wish the chess world would step up and meet him

02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:53.340
in a place that makes sense,

02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:56.540
change the world championship.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:00.460
So if he did changing it somehow that allows for that

02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:03.620
or having other really respected tournaments

02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:06.420
that become like an annual thing that step up to that

02:17:07.380 --> 02:17:12.100
or more kind of online YouTube type of competitions,

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:14.580
which I think they're trying to do more and more

02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.420
like the crypto cup and all those kinds of things.

02:17:16.420 --> 02:17:17.900
And the grand tour.

02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:18.740
The grand tour.

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:19.580
Which does play in,

02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.140
which takes a lot of the top players

02:17:21.140 --> 02:17:23.780
and they do it online in shorter formats.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:26.300
But there's, you know, so that's his perspective.

02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:30.340
My perhaps narrow perspective

02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:32.380
is I romanticize the Olympic games

02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:33.700
and those are every four years

02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:38.220
and the world championships because they're rare

02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:40.460
because the sample size is so small.

02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.220
That's where the magic happens.

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:45.180
Everything's on the line for, you know,

02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:47.900
people that spend their whole life,

02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:51.580
20 years of dedication, everything you have,

02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:54.700
every minute of the day spent for that moment.

02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:56.260
You know, you think about like gymnastics

02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:57.540
at the Olympic games.

02:17:57.540 --> 02:17:59.740
There's certain sports where a single mistake

02:17:59.740 --> 02:18:01.260
and you're fucked.

02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:03.620
And that stress, that pressure,

02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:11.140
it can break people or it can create magic.

02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:13.540
Like a person that's the underdog

02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.500
has the best night of their life.

02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:18.220
Or the person that's been dominating for years

02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:19.860
all of a sudden slips up.

02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:22.100
That drama from a human perspective is beautiful.

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:24.540
So I still like the world championships.

02:18:24.540 --> 02:18:28.300
But then again, looking at all the draws,

02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:33.300
looking at like, well, the magic isn't quite there.

02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:36.460
So to me, when I see faster games of chess,

02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:39.380
that's much more beautiful.

02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:41.500
But I don't understand the game of chess

02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.180
deeply enough to know.

02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:48.420
Does it have to be so many draws?

02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:51.460
Like, is there a way to create a more dynamic chess?

02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:53.820
And he talked about random chess

02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:55.420
with a random starting position.

02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:56.260
That's really interesting.

02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:58.460
But then of course, that's like,

02:18:58.460 --> 02:19:00.580
then you do have to play hundreds of games

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:01.820
and that kind of stuff.

02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:02.660
Right.

02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:07.340
So, but I think it's great that the world number one

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:12.460
is struggling with these questions.

02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:13.860
Because he's in the position,

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:16.820
he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:19.500
as it's publicly seen, as it's publicly played.

02:19:19.500 --> 02:19:21.860
So it's interesting.

02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:24.180
He's still young enough to dominate

02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:26.340
for quite a long time if he wants.

02:19:26.340 --> 02:19:27.180
So I don't know.

02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:32.140
I, with Kasparov, the fight between nations,

02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:34.780
I hope they have the world championship.

02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:36.380
And I hope there's a,

02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.580
I hope he's still a part of it somehow.

02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.420
I hope he changes his mind.

02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:41.260
And comes back.

02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:44.660
Comes back, some kind of dramatic thing, I don't know.

02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:47.900
But it is, his heart is not in it.

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:48.740
And then,

02:19:51.700 --> 02:19:53.980
and then that's not beautiful to see.

02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:54.820
Right.

02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:02.020
Yeah, it is beautiful that the thing he wants

02:20:02.020 --> 02:20:04.460
is a great game of chess against an opponent

02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.140
that's his level or better.

02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:10.100
And that's great that he's coming from that place.

02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:11.900
But I hope he comes back tomorrow.

02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:15.380
Because the world championship is a special thing

02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:16.940
in any sport.

02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:19.060
So you do wish that the person who wins

02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:21.820
the world championship is the best player in the world?

02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:24.740
No.

02:20:25.780 --> 02:20:28.660
I hope that the best people in the world,

02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:31.740
the two best people in the world are the ones that sit down.

02:20:33.180 --> 02:20:35.820
But the person that wins is the person that,

02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:37.180
that's the magic of it.

02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.180
Nobody knows who's going to win.

02:20:39.180 --> 02:20:41.820
I think Magnus is so,

02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:43.940
he really wants the best person to win.

02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:48.540
That's why he wants the large sample size.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.500
But to me, there's some magic to it.

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:53.380
The stress of it, the drama of it,

02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:55.340
that's all part of the game.

02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:58.140
Like it's not just about the purity of the game,

02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:01.820
like the calculation, the pure chess of it.

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.180
It's also like the drama.

02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:07.820
Yeah, the pressure, the drama, all of it.

02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:10.780
The shit talking, if it gets to you, the mind games.

02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:12.620
This is the part that's fun to watch,

02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:14.540
but less fun to be playing.

02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:15.780
But that's why it's great.

02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:18.700
Who can melt, who can rise under that pressure

02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:20.460
and who melts under that pressure.

02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:24.220
There's a lot of people that look up to you,

02:21:24.220 --> 02:21:26.260
like they're inspired by you

02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.780
because you've taken a kind of nonlinear path through life.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:31.060
Is there any advice you have for people

02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:32.460
like in high school today

02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:35.820
that are trying to figure out what they want to do?

02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.100
Do they want to go to Stanford?

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:41.340
Do they want to pursue a career in, I don't know,

02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:45.980
in industry or go kind of the path you guys have taken,

02:21:45.980 --> 02:21:48.460
which is have the ability to do all of that

02:21:48.460 --> 02:21:50.620
and still choose to make the thing

02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:52.660
that you're passionate about your life?

02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:56.700
I always liked the calculated risks approach

02:21:56.700 --> 02:22:00.340
where when you're younger, it's okay to take more risks

02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:02.300
because you have a lot more time,

02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:03.980
but there has to be a reason

02:22:03.980 --> 02:22:06.060
why you're doing that particular risk.

02:22:06.100 --> 02:22:08.060
Is it something that you've spent a lot of time

02:22:08.060 --> 02:22:09.860
already really passionate and working on

02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:11.300
or is it just something that's trendy

02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:12.140
and you want to do it

02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:13.900
because you don't have a better option?

02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:16.340
And that's actually similar to what Andrea did

02:22:16.340 --> 02:22:19.540
when she decided to go into streaming instead of school.

02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:21.940
Yeah, it was the reason I got into streaming

02:22:21.940 --> 02:22:24.260
because I was initially going to go to college,

02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.460
but the pandemics,

02:22:25.460 --> 02:22:27.260
it was right at the beginning of the pandemic

02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:29.340
and all my classes were online.

02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:31.940
And I never thought ever since I was 12,

02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:33.620
my dream was school

02:22:33.620 --> 02:22:37.900
and I saw myself nowhere else than going to university.

02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:40.380
And I thought of it and kind of weighed out the risks.

02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.700
I'm like, well, if I take a gap year

02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:45.140
and I try streaming with my sister, what do I have to lose?

02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:47.340
I gained some experience working with someone

02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:49.820
who has a lot more experience than I do.

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:52.300
And then I can go back to school after.

02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:53.940
And if I go to school right now,

02:22:53.940 --> 02:22:55.420
I do online classes for a year

02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:57.340
and that's something that I could do at any time.

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.900
So that's why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this.

02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:04.260
But of course, this is also a very unique opportunity.

02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:05.620
So I don't know how applicable,

02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:07.740
but I do think overall the calculated risk

02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:08.580
is a really good lesson.

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.300
So life is like chess.

02:23:10.300 --> 02:23:11.780
Exactly.

02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:12.900
Maybe sometimes.

02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:13.860
Exactly.

02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:15.940
You also, have you considered a career

02:23:15.940 --> 02:23:16.900
in professional fighting?

02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:18.860
I saw you did a self-defense class.

02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:20.300
You did a little jiu-jitsu.

02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:22.900
Did you see the 10-year-old kid who-

02:23:22.900 --> 02:23:24.260
Throwing her?

02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:26.540
Yes, and apparently I could have broken a leg.

02:23:26.540 --> 02:23:29.380
But it's actually funny, like chess boxing is a thing

02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:31.260
and I have been doing a lot of boxing.

02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:35.980
Physical activity is honestly one of my favorite things to do

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:38.260
and I have been testing it out on content.

02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:40.020
And we have a creator friend

02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:42.020
who's hosting a chess boxing tournament,

02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:45.780
but there's no woman who could match me, unfortunately,

02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:47.660
because all the opponents are male

02:23:47.660 --> 02:23:50.100
and I can't fight a guy.

02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.660
How does chess boxing work?

02:23:51.660 --> 02:23:54.140
So you do a round of chess and a round of boxing.

02:23:54.140 --> 02:23:56.540
And we actually did a training camp for it before.

02:23:56.700 --> 02:23:59.380
And of course, after you go into the ring-

02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:00.220
Is this real?

02:24:00.220 --> 02:24:01.060
Is this serious?

02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:01.900
Yes, it's amazing.

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:03.380
We went to a London chess boxing club.

02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:04.220
And after you get-

02:24:04.220 --> 02:24:05.140
No, it seemed like videos,

02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.060
I thought it was something you'd just do in Russia or something.

02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:08.220
No, it's a real sport.

02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:09.060
Yeah.

02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:09.900
It's a real sport.

02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:10.740
Yeah, no, it's very cool.

02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:12.340
But after you get really tired,

02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:14.020
you're more likely to make a mistake

02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:16.060
and they call them Jaffers or something.

02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:17.620
Yeah, that's probably a good strategy is like,

02:24:17.620 --> 02:24:19.380
what do you want to,

02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:21.340
because some of it is a cardio thing.

02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:23.780
Do you want to work on your chess or your boxing?

02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:25.580
They do both, it's very fun.

02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:27.140
But yeah, from a content perspective,

02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:28.740
I'm sure there's a lot of people that like-

02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.100
And it's also very entertaining.

02:24:30.100 --> 02:24:31.940
Would love to see.

02:24:31.940 --> 02:24:33.820
I don't want to see Andrea getting hit,

02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:34.660
that would be wrong.

02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:35.500
I would love to-

02:24:35.500 --> 02:24:36.620
Unless she doesn't get hit.

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:37.740
I would get-

02:24:37.740 --> 02:24:39.660
Our roommate fought in a fight

02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:40.940
and she did end up winning,

02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:42.340
but seeing her get hit,

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.780
I thought I was going to throw up off screen.

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:44.940
I just think it was so cool.

02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:47.140
She had no experience in boxing whatsoever.

02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:49.540
And then coming from someone in the content world

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:52.140
where you start like waking up six days a week at 6 a.m.

02:24:52.140 --> 02:24:53.500
and she's training every day,

02:24:54.140 --> 02:24:55.860
like a real professional athlete,

02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.260
I think it's such a unique experience

02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:00.060
and also like a really test

02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:02.940
of how much you can really commit to this and progress.

02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:05.140
And I think that's really rewarding.

02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:08.340
Did you ever end up doing the marathon with David Goggins

02:25:08.340 --> 02:25:09.180
that you were training?

02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:11.860
No, I got injured, but we're going to do it soon.

02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:14.140
That's on my bucket list,

02:25:14.140 --> 02:25:15.580
just to see what your limits are.

02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:16.420
You're ready to do it?

02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:18.220
What did you do leading up to this?

02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:21.060
You're just going to go into it?

02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:22.620
It's mental anyway.

02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:25.180
But I do run a lot to make sure like there's no,

02:25:27.420 --> 02:25:30.020
you have to have a base level of fitness

02:25:30.020 --> 02:25:32.300
to make sure your body doesn't completely freak out.

02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:36.380
But other than that, 50 plus miles is just about

02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:39.540
taking it one step at a time

02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:42.260
and just being able to deal with the suffering

02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:43.820
and all the voices, the little voices

02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:45.780
that tell you all the excuses like,

02:25:45.780 --> 02:25:47.420
why are you doing this?

02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:51.780
This blister is bleeding, whatever the thing

02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.020
that makes you want to stop, just shut it off.

02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:56.940
Sometimes it feels like you like pain.

02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:00.220
No, well, no, no.

02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:05.220
But the pain does seem to show the way to progress.

02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:08.100
So what- In your turn of events.

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:10.540
In my world, something that's really hard

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:11.660
and I don't want to do,

02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:14.180
that's usually the right thing to do.

02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:18.020
And I'm not saying that's like a universal truth.

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:22.140
It's just, if there's a few doors to go into,

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:24.380
the one that I'd want to go into least,

02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:27.420
that's the one that usually is the right one.

02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:29.940
Afterwards, I will learn something from it.

02:26:29.940 --> 02:26:31.940
The David Goggins thing, I don't know.

02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:34.700
Listen, we're talking offline,

02:26:34.700 --> 02:26:36.060
the conversation with Liv.

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:38.740
She has a very numeric, calculated risk.

02:26:38.740 --> 02:26:39.820
Everything is planned.

02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:40.900
I go with the heart.

02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:42.940
I just go whatever the hell.

02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:44.900
I think two years ago, I woke up,

02:26:45.900 --> 02:26:48.180
it was summer.

02:26:48.180 --> 02:26:50.380
I decided to tweet.

02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:53.300
I will do as many push-ups.

02:26:53.300 --> 02:26:55.580
I don't know why I did this,

02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:58.220
but I will do as many push-ups and pull-ups

02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.340
as this week gets likes, something like that.

02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:01.500
Okay, good.

02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:05.820
And then it got like 30,000.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:08.340
Once you put it out on the internet,

02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:09.180
you're held accountable.

02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:11.540
Well, for myself, I mean, in some sense.

02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:14.580
And then that's when I already was connected to David.

02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:18.100
At that point, but that's when he called me.

02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:19.820
And then have to do it.

02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.660
And then I did it.

02:27:20.660 --> 02:27:22.500
It was one of the hardest things I've ever done.

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:23.660
How long did you take?

02:27:23.660 --> 02:27:25.980
I did it for seven days and I got injured.

02:27:25.980 --> 02:27:27.780
So I did about a few thousand.

02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:30.980
Wait, so this is what got you to be injured this week?

02:27:30.980 --> 02:27:31.820
No, it's different.

02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.340
I keep getting injured doing some stuff.

02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:36.580
But this particular thing, I started doing the,

02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:39.140
you don't realize that you have to really ramp up.

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:42.500
So I got like overuse injury tendonitis

02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:46.060
on the shoulder all the way down to the elbow.

02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:49.940
So I took like eight or nine days off

02:27:49.940 --> 02:27:51.100
and then started again.

02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:55.780
And then it took about 31 days to do.

02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:57.300
30,000.

02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:01.620
The number was like 26, 27,000.

02:28:01.620 --> 02:28:02.740
Yeah. Wow.

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:06.260
And it took like three, four hours a day.

02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:07.700
Oh God. Yeah.

02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:08.940
Sounds like torture.

02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:11.500
And not, you know, and I'm constantly asking myself,

02:28:11.500 --> 02:28:13.220
what am I doing with my life?

02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:16.700
This is why you're single, was the voice in my head.

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:18.260
This is what are you doing?

02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:23.100
It's like face down on the carpet, like exhausted.

02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:24.700
Like what, what?

02:28:24.700 --> 02:28:25.740
Because of a tweet?

02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:26.900
What is this?

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:28.540
Did you record it or you just recorded it?

02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:30.340
I did, I did record it for myself.

02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:31.180
Okay.

02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:32.940
Now imagine doing this every day

02:28:32.940 --> 02:28:34.940
and that's what it's like to be a Twitch streamer.

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:35.780
Just kidding.

02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:36.600
Right.

02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:37.440
And doing stupid things.

02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:38.280
Thanks for commenting.

02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:39.260
That was really important to me actually

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:41.140
to not make it into content.

02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:43.340
You know, I recorded everything.

02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:45.020
So maybe one day I could publish it.

02:28:45.020 --> 02:28:48.420
I recorded it mostly because it's really hard to count.

02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:49.260
Yeah.

02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:50.460
When you get exhausted.

02:28:50.460 --> 02:28:51.300
Yeah.

02:28:51.300 --> 02:28:54.700
Like I just, so you actually enter the Zen place

02:28:54.700 --> 02:28:58.140
where with pushups, where it's just like,

02:28:58.140 --> 02:28:59.740
it's almost like, like breathing.

02:28:59.740 --> 02:29:02.620
You get into a rhythm and you can do quite a lot.

02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:04.140
But I wanted to make sure like,

02:29:04.140 --> 02:29:05.620
if I actually get this done,

02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:08.940
I want there to be evidence that I got it done

02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:10.580
for myself so I can count it.

02:29:10.580 --> 02:29:12.260
I had this idea that I would use machine learning

02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.180
to like automatically process the video to count it.

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:17.620
But then like after like 10 days,

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:19.100
I didn't even give a shit what anyone thought.

02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:21.260
It was about me versus me.

02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:22.100
I didn't even care.

02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:23.380
Lex versus Lex.

02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:24.220
Yeah.

02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:26.020
And then, yeah.

02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:27.580
And David was extremely supportive.

02:29:27.580 --> 02:29:28.620
But that's when I realized like,

02:29:28.620 --> 02:29:31.240
I really want to go head to head with him.

02:29:32.740 --> 02:29:33.580
Yeah.

02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:34.760
Those kinds of people are beautiful.

02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:36.060
They really challenge you to your limits.

02:29:36.060 --> 02:29:37.180
Whatever that is.

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:41.100
The thing is, physical exercise is such an easy way

02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:43.260
to push yourself to your limit.

02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:46.380
In all other walks of life, it's trickier to configure.

02:29:46.380 --> 02:29:48.780
Like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess?

02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:50.420
It's hard to figure out.

02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:51.260
But like in physical-

02:29:51.260 --> 02:29:53.180
You think it's ever dangerous?

02:29:53.180 --> 02:29:54.020
Yeah.

02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:56.100
And that's why it's beautiful.

02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:56.940
The danger-

02:29:56.940 --> 02:29:57.780
She likes the pain.

02:29:57.780 --> 02:30:00.020
I don't like that your eyes lit up as I said.

02:30:00.020 --> 02:30:01.260
Yeah.

02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:04.780
Like if you don't know how you're gonna get out of it,

02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:07.900
you're gonna have to figure out something profound.

02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:08.740
It is the-

02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:09.580
About yourself.

02:30:10.460 --> 02:30:13.060
And I mean, one of the reasons I went to Ukraine

02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:18.060
is I really wanted to experience the hardship

02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:23.980
and the intensity of war that people are experiencing

02:30:23.980 --> 02:30:25.980
so I can understand myself better,

02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:27.460
I can understand them better.

02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:30.740
So the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded

02:30:30.740 --> 02:30:32.860
in a better understanding of who they are.

02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:36.100
I mean, running a lot with David Gong

02:30:36.100 --> 02:30:39.380
is just a much simpler thing to do,

02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:42.420
simpler way to understand something about yourself,

02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:44.500
about like the limits of human nature.

02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:47.780
I think most growth happens with voluntary suffering

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.220
or struggle.

02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:52.700
Involuntary stuff, that's where the dark trauma is created.

02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:57.540
But I don't know, maybe it is, maybe I'm just attracted to-

02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:59.580
And what is it that your mind does

02:30:59.580 --> 02:31:02.180
when you're going through this involuntary suffering?

02:31:03.260 --> 02:31:04.100
I think...

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:15.940
There's like stages.

02:31:15.940 --> 02:31:17.780
First, all the excuses start coming.

02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:20.420
Like, why are you doing this?

02:31:20.420 --> 02:31:23.300
And then you start to wonder like,

02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:26.980
what kind of person do you want to be?

02:31:26.980 --> 02:31:28.460
So all the dreams you had,

02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:30.460
all the promises you made to yourself and to others,

02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:34.580
all the ambitions you had that haven't come yet realized,

02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:39.100
somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral

02:31:39.100 --> 02:31:41.340
as this struggle is happening.

02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:46.340
And then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind,

02:31:47.740 --> 02:31:49.340
you have this clear appreciation

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.820
of what you really love in life,

02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:54.300
which is just like, just living, just the moment,

02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:57.340
like the step at a time.

02:31:57.340 --> 02:32:00.100
I think what meditation does, and it's most effective,

02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:02.500
it's just that pain is a catalyst

02:32:02.500 --> 02:32:05.060
for the meditative process, I think.

02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:07.980
For me, for me, I don't know.

02:32:09.100 --> 02:32:10.740
Magnus said there's no meaning to life.

02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:11.660
Do you guys agree?

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:14.460
Or no?

02:32:14.460 --> 02:32:15.540
Why are we here?

02:32:17.580 --> 02:32:20.540
I do not know why we're here,

02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:25.540
but I do know that having some kind of meaning

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:29.140
that I give my own life makes it

02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:31.940
a lot more motivating every day,

02:32:31.940 --> 02:32:34.060
so I just try to focus on finding meaning

02:32:34.060 --> 02:32:37.340
within my own life, even if I know it's just self-imposed.

02:32:38.620 --> 02:32:40.660
And then chess is a part of that?

02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:44.820
Chess is a part of it.

02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:47.740
Maybe it was more so when I was younger,

02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:50.060
because it was easier to just feel like

02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:52.100
I want to improve as a person

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:55.060
and use chess to kind of measure

02:32:55.060 --> 02:32:57.220
some kind of self-improvement.

02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:00.460
And now it's more different than that,

02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.860
and I think I need to once again find

02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:06.940
what that northern star is.

02:33:06.940 --> 02:33:09.740
Basically, I need to have a why for why I'm doing things,

02:33:09.740 --> 02:33:12.260
and then I feel like I could do very hard things.

02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:18.500
What role does love play in the human condition?

02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:20.300
Alex and Andrea.

02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:23.180
I'll let Andrea start this one since I took the last.

02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:24.020
Sure.

02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:26.860
And yeah, just to add my answer for the last one,

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:30.780
I also kind of think, well, life is meaningless,

02:33:30.780 --> 02:33:32.860
but I like the stoic idea where that's something

02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:35.300
that you live to revolt against.

02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:37.460
But for the second question.

02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:40.420
The revolt against the fundamental

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:42.020
meaninglessness of life, I like it.

02:33:42.020 --> 02:33:42.860
Yes, exactly.

02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:45.820
It was what does love play?

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.140
What role does love play?

02:33:47.140 --> 02:33:48.620
Yeah, in the human condition.

02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:51.260
The way I see it,

02:33:54.060 --> 02:33:57.420
love is a reason you want to share experiences

02:33:57.420 --> 02:33:59.220
with other people.

02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.060
That's how I see it.

02:34:00.060 --> 02:34:01.340
Like the people you really love,

02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:04.340
you want to share the things you're going through with them.

02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:06.540
The good and the bad.

02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:08.060
Yeah, exactly.

02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:09.860
That's my simple take on love.

02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:16.860
My take on it is that part of what it is to be human

02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:20.620
is to be somebody who feels things emotionally

02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:25.260
and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have.

02:34:26.380 --> 02:34:28.460
Obviously there's the opposite of that

02:34:28.460 --> 02:34:30.060
and there's things like hate,

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.420
but I think the love you feel for people

02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:35.100
like your parents and your friends and romantic love

02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:38.620
in that moment is much more intense

02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:40.100
than in other situations.

02:34:41.380 --> 02:34:44.460
And I think it's also just very unique to humans

02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:46.900
and that's what I appreciate about it.

02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:49.380
Maybe that's the meaning of life.

02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:52.260
Maybe that's what the Stoics are searching for.

02:34:52.260 --> 02:34:54.620
Andrea, Alex, thank you so much for this

02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:56.660
and thank you for an amazing conversation.

02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:02.900

Thank you for having us, Lex.

02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:05.780

02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:24.660
Chess is life.

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:28.540
