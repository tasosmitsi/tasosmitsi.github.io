00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
The following is a conversation with Sean Kelly,

00:02.640 --> 00:06.800
a philosopher at Harvard specializing in existentialism

00:06.800 --> 00:09.120
and the philosophy of mind.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.360
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.640
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:13.640 --> 00:15.160
in the description.

00:15.160 --> 00:19.000
And now here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.

00:19.960 --> 00:24.840
Your interests are in post-continent European philosophy,

00:24.840 --> 00:28.440
especially phenomenology and existentialism.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.880
So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?

00:33.720 --> 00:36.080
So it's a hard question.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.440
I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.

00:38.440 --> 00:39.280
You are.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.100
I am, yeah.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.060
Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.480
The traditional thing to say about what existentialism is

00:49.480 --> 00:53.220
is that it's a movement in mid 20th century,

00:53.220 --> 00:56.720
mostly French, some German philosophy

00:56.720 --> 00:59.120
and some of the major figures associated with it

00:59.120 --> 01:03.640
are people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Camus,

01:03.640 --> 01:07.120
Simone de Beauvoir, maybe Martin Heidegger.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.480
But that's a weird thing to say about it

01:09.480 --> 01:11.300
because most of those people denied

01:11.300 --> 01:13.000
that they were existentialists.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.360
And in fact, I think of it as a movement

01:17.360 --> 01:19.740
that has a much longer history.

01:19.740 --> 01:23.240
So when I try to describe what the core idea

01:23.240 --> 01:25.280
of existentialism is,

01:25.320 --> 01:27.880
it's an idea that you find expressed in different ways

01:27.880 --> 01:29.320
in a bunch of these people.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.460
One of the ways that it's expressed

01:32.460 --> 01:37.460
is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the view

01:37.960 --> 01:42.800
that there is no God and at least his form of existentialism,

01:42.800 --> 01:44.880
he calls it atheistic existentialism.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.380
There is no God.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.320
And since there's no God,

01:48.320 --> 01:51.640
there must be some other being around

01:51.640 --> 01:54.600
who does something like what God does.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.840
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any possibility

01:56.840 --> 01:59.080
for significance in a life.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.120
And that being is us and the feature of us,

02:03.120 --> 02:06.760
according to Sartre and the other existentialists

02:06.760 --> 02:10.120
that puts us in the position to be able to play that role

02:10.120 --> 02:12.360
is that we're the beings for whom,

02:12.360 --> 02:16.420
as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.320
That's the catchphrase for existentialism.

02:20.320 --> 02:23.400
And then you have to try to figure out what it means.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.120
What does existence, what does presence

02:25.120 --> 02:26.400
and what does precedes mean?

02:26.400 --> 02:27.320
Yeah, exactly.

02:27.320 --> 02:28.240
What is existence?

02:28.240 --> 02:30.480
What is essence and what is precedes?

02:30.480 --> 02:33.680
And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it

02:33.680 --> 02:35.440
and other people will talk about it differently.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.280
But here's the way Sartre thinks about it.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.120
This is not, I think, the most interesting way

02:40.120 --> 02:42.280
to think about it, but it gets you started.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.280
Sartre says there's nothing true about what it is to be you

02:48.120 --> 02:53.120
until you start existing and until you start living.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.720
And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is

02:57.720 --> 03:01.680
to be existing the way we do is to be making decisions,

03:01.680 --> 03:03.680
to be making choices in your life,

03:03.680 --> 03:08.160
to be sort of taking a stand on what it is to be you

03:08.160 --> 03:11.320
by deciding to do this or that.

03:11.320 --> 03:16.320
And the key feature of how to do that right for Sartre

03:17.080 --> 03:19.360
is to do it in the full recognition of the fact

03:19.360 --> 03:21.480
that when you make that choice,

03:21.480 --> 03:25.560
nobody is responsible for it other than you.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.760
So you don't make the choice because God tells you to,

03:28.760 --> 03:33.160
you don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus

03:33.160 --> 03:36.040
about what it's right to do tells you to do.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.280
You don't make the choice because some other

03:38.280 --> 03:40.840
philosophical theory tells you to do it.

03:40.840 --> 03:43.040
There's literally nothing on the basis

03:43.040 --> 03:46.160
of which you make the choice other than the fact

03:47.000 --> 03:50.240
that in that moment, you're the one making it.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.400
You are a conscious thinking being that made a decision.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.840
So all of the questions about physics

03:56.840 --> 03:59.640
and free will are out the window.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.600
Yeah, that's right.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.600
If you were a determinist about the mind,

04:03.600 --> 04:05.400
if you were a physicalist about the mind,

04:05.400 --> 04:08.320
if you thought there was nothing to your choices

04:08.320 --> 04:10.680
other than the activity of the brain

04:11.560 --> 04:13.840
that's governed by physical laws,

04:13.840 --> 04:18.120
then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate

04:18.120 --> 04:21.040
like you're not the ground of that choice.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.000
The ground of that choice was the physical universe

04:23.000 --> 04:24.640
and the laws that govern it.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.440
And then you'd have no responsibility.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.160
And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special

04:29.160 --> 04:32.200
about us used to be special about God

04:32.200 --> 04:36.680
is that we're responsible for becoming the being

04:36.680 --> 04:38.760
that makes the choices that we do.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.040
And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering.

04:43.040 --> 04:46.360
I mean, it practically puts us in the place of God

04:46.360 --> 04:50.360
and also terrifying because what responsibility?

04:50.360 --> 04:54.120
How can you possibly take on that responsibility?

04:54.120 --> 04:55.520
And he thinks it's worse than that.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.120
He thinks that it's always happening.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.960
Everything that you do is the result of some choice

05:02.960 --> 05:06.680
that you've made, the posture that you sit in,

05:06.680 --> 05:08.840
the way you hold someone's gaze

05:08.840 --> 05:11.920
when you're having a conversation with them or not,

05:11.920 --> 05:14.920
the choice to make a note

05:14.920 --> 05:18.360
when someone says something or not make a note.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.960
Everything that you do presents you as a being

05:21.960 --> 05:24.600
who makes decisions and you're responsible for all of them.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.960
So it's constantly happening.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.000
And furthermore, there's no fact about you

05:31.960 --> 05:35.880
independent of the choices and actions you've performed.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.600
So you don't get to say, Sartre's example,

05:38.600 --> 05:40.440
I really am a great writer.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.200
I just haven't written my great book yet.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.240
If you haven't written your great book,

05:44.240 --> 05:45.840
you're not a great writer.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.800
And so it's terrifying.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.960
It puts a huge burden on us.

05:49.960 --> 05:54.960
And that's why Sartre says on his view of existentialism,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.360
human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.080
Our freedom consists in our ability

06:01.080 --> 06:04.120
and our responsibility to make these choices

06:04.120 --> 06:06.480
and to become someone through making them.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.680
And we can't get away from that.

06:08.680 --> 06:12.000
But to him, it's terrifying not liberating

06:12.000 --> 06:14.720
in the positive meaning of the word liberating.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.520
Well, so he thinks it should be liberating,

06:17.520 --> 06:20.200
but he thinks that it takes a very courageous individual

06:20.200 --> 06:21.840
to be liberated by it.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.880
Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.160
I think Sartre is really coming out

06:27.160 --> 06:29.760
of a Nietzschean sort of tradition.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.640
But what's liberating about it, if it is,

06:32.640 --> 06:37.280
is also terrifying because it means in a certain way,

06:37.280 --> 06:39.360
you're the ground of your own being.

06:39.360 --> 06:43.640
You become what you do through existing.

06:43.640 --> 06:45.440
So that's one form of existentialism.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.520
That's a stark atheistic version of it.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.280
There's lots of other versions.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.720
But it's somehow organized around the idea

06:52.720 --> 06:54.640
that it's through living your life

06:54.640 --> 06:56.000
that you become who you are.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.160
It's not facts that are sort of true about you,

06:59.160 --> 07:01.680
independent of your living your life.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.680
But then if there's no God in that view,

07:07.320 --> 07:10.080
does any of the decisions matter?

07:10.080 --> 07:14.240
So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?

07:14.240 --> 07:17.120
Good, okay, great question.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.800
There was two different ways that you're asking it.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.440
Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second

07:23.440 --> 07:25.360
and think about mattering.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.640
Or is there any way that you can criticize someone

07:29.640 --> 07:32.600
for living the way they do if you're an existentialist?

07:32.600 --> 07:33.680
Including yourself.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.200
Including yourself, yeah.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.760
Sartre addresses that.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.960
And he says, yes.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.720
He says, there is a criticism

07:41.720 --> 07:44.520
that you can make of yourself or of others.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.760
And it's the criticism of living in such a way

07:46.760 --> 07:50.240
as to fail to take responsibility for your choices.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.720
He gives these two sort of amazing examples.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.120
One, I don't know if it reads as well for us

07:57.120 --> 08:01.960
as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris,

08:01.960 --> 08:04.200
but it's about a waiter.

08:04.200 --> 08:07.200
He gives this in his big book, Being in Nothingness.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.200
And he says, so waiters played,

08:10.200 --> 08:13.320
still do I think in a certain way in Paris,

08:13.320 --> 08:15.680
a big role in Parisian society,

08:15.680 --> 08:18.320
to be a waiter involved, having a certain kind of identity,

08:18.320 --> 08:23.320
being a certain way, taking control of and charge of

08:23.680 --> 08:27.200
the experience of the people that you're waiting on,

08:27.200 --> 08:29.640
but also really being the authority,

08:29.640 --> 08:33.680
like knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.680
And so Sartre imagines a waiter

08:35.680 --> 08:39.560
who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do,

08:39.560 --> 08:42.920
sort of the perfect form of the waiter,

08:42.920 --> 08:47.840
except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it,

08:47.840 --> 08:50.600
that he's doing it because he believes

08:50.600 --> 08:53.880
that's the way a waiter should act.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.320
Not, so there's some sense in which he's passing off

08:57.320 --> 09:00.320
the responsibility for his actions

09:00.320 --> 09:03.040
onto some idea of what those actions should be.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.120
He's not taking responsibility for it.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.480
He's sort of playing a role.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.880
And the contours of the role are predetermined

09:10.880 --> 09:12.800
by someone other than him.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.560
So he starts as acting in bad faith.

09:15.560 --> 09:20.240
And that's criticizable because it's acting in such a way

09:20.240 --> 09:22.680
as to fail to take responsibility

09:22.680 --> 09:25.400
for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.600
So you're not taking responsibility.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.960
So that's one example.

09:27.960 --> 09:32.880
And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager,

09:32.880 --> 09:35.040
you've known someone who does that.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.960
Teenagers try on roles.

09:36.960 --> 09:41.240
They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.720
So I'll dress like this.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.280
Or if I spoke like this or acted like this.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.800
And it's natural for a teenager

09:47.800 --> 09:51.320
who's trying to figure out what their identity is

09:51.320 --> 09:52.720
to go through a phase like that.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.440
But if you continue to do that,

09:54.440 --> 09:55.800
then you're really passing it.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.080
So that's one example.

09:57.080 --> 10:01.080
And the other example he gives is an example

10:01.080 --> 10:03.880
not of passing off responsibility

10:03.880 --> 10:08.880
by pretending that someone else is the ground of your choice,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.920
but passing off responsibility by pretending

10:12.920 --> 10:14.160
that you might be able to get away

10:14.160 --> 10:15.760
with not making a choice at all.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.360
So he says, you're always,

10:18.360 --> 10:20.960
everything you do is a result of your choices.

10:20.960 --> 10:22.640
And so he gives this other example.

10:22.640 --> 10:27.640
There you are on the first date, first date.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.960
And the date, the evening reaches moments

10:31.960 --> 10:36.960
when might be appropriate for one person

10:37.480 --> 10:40.760
to hold the hand of the other.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.720
That's the moment in the date where you are.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.960
And so you make a choice.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.960
You decide, I think it's that time and you hold the hand.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.720
And what should happen is that the other person

10:51.720 --> 10:53.960
also makes a choice on Sartre's view.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.320
Either they reject the hand, not that time.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.840
And I'm taking responsibility for that.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.680
Or they grasp the hands back.

11:02.680 --> 11:03.680
That's a choice.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.280
But there's a thing that sometimes happens,

11:06.280 --> 11:09.880
which is that the other person leaves the hand there cold,

11:09.880 --> 11:14.880
dead and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.600
And Sartre says, that's also bad faith.

11:18.600 --> 11:23.120
That's also acting as if we're kind of being that we're not

11:23.160 --> 11:27.680
because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.560
And we're the beings who are always making choices.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.120
That was a choice.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.840
And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing

11:33.840 --> 11:36.040
that you don't have to take responsibility for.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.480
So both of the examples you've given,

11:38.480 --> 11:41.120
there's some sense in which the social interactions

11:41.120 --> 11:44.640
between humans is a kind of moving away

11:44.640 --> 11:48.400
from the full responsibility that you as a human

11:49.360 --> 11:52.600
in the view of existentialism should take on.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.720
So like, isn't the basic conversation,

11:55.720 --> 11:59.440
a delegation responsibility, just holding a hand there,

11:59.440 --> 12:01.720
you're putting some of the responsibility

12:01.720 --> 12:04.040
into the court of the other person.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.280
And for the waiter, if you exist in a society,

12:08.280 --> 12:12.520
you are generally trying on a roll.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.040
I mean, all of us are trying on a roll.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.800
Me wearing clothes is me trying on a roll

12:18.800 --> 12:21.720
that I was told to try, as opposed to walking around

12:21.720 --> 12:22.800
naked all the time.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.240
Like there's like standards of how you operate.

12:26.240 --> 12:31.240
And that's a decision that's not my own.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.280
That's me seeing what everyone else is doing

12:33.280 --> 12:34.720
and copying them.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.880
Yeah, exactly.

12:35.880 --> 12:40.880
So Sartre thinks that in the ideal,

12:41.600 --> 12:43.320
you should try to resist that.

12:43.320 --> 12:48.320
Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue

12:49.160 --> 12:51.320
to how you should live well.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.160
So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.840
Why is hell other people for Sartre?

12:57.840 --> 13:01.240
Well, because other people are making choices also.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.040
And when other people make choices,

13:04.040 --> 13:09.040
they put some pressure on me to think that the choice

13:09.400 --> 13:12.880
they made is one that I should copy

13:12.880 --> 13:17.120
or one that I should sort of promote.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.080
But if I do it because they did it,

13:19.080 --> 13:21.680
then I'm in bad faith for Sartre.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.840
So it is as if Sartre's view is like,

13:24.840 --> 13:27.400
we would be better if we were all alone.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.080
I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.080
And this is really just mostly Sartre

13:33.080 --> 13:36.680
in a certain period of his formation.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.640
But anyhow, we can imagine that view.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.360
And I think there's something to the idea

13:41.360 --> 13:44.440
that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in the mid-40s.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.640
Can you dig into hell is other people?

13:46.640 --> 13:51.040
Is there some, obviously it's kind of almost like a literary,

13:51.040 --> 13:55.520
like you push the point strongly to really explore that point.

13:55.520 --> 14:00.400
But is there some sense in that other people ruin

14:00.400 --> 14:03.400
the experience of what it means to be human?

14:03.400 --> 14:06.120
I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.480
It's not just that you wear clothes

14:08.480 --> 14:10.400
because people wear clothes in our society.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.200
You have a particular style.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.240
You wear a particular kind of clothes.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.600
And for Sartre, to have that style authentically

14:19.600 --> 14:22.360
in good faith rather than in bad faith,

14:22.360 --> 14:23.760
it has to come from you.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.840
You have to make the choice.

14:25.840 --> 14:28.000
But other people are making choices also.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.720
And you're looking at their choices

14:30.720 --> 14:33.000
and you're thinking, that guy looks good.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.960
Maybe I could try that one on.

14:34.960 --> 14:39.040
And if you try it on because you were influenced

14:39.040 --> 14:42.480
by the fact that you thought that guy was doing it well,

14:42.480 --> 14:44.160
then there's some important sense in which,

14:44.160 --> 14:46.320
although that's a resource for a choice for you,

14:46.320 --> 14:48.800
it's also acting in bad faith.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.880
So, and God wouldn't do that, right?

14:52.880 --> 14:55.600
God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.160
And if that's the model, then I think that's the sense

14:59.160 --> 15:00.400
in which he thinks hell is other people.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.960
What do you think parenting is then?

15:02.960 --> 15:05.640
It's like what, because God doesn't have a parent.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.320
So aren't we significantly influenced,

15:08.320 --> 15:10.880
first of all, in the first few years of life?

15:11.720 --> 15:16.320
And even the teenager is resisting,

15:16.320 --> 15:19.080
learning through resistance, so.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.320
Absolutely.

15:20.320 --> 15:25.320
I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition

15:25.720 --> 15:29.040
that the ideal that Sartre's aiming at

15:29.040 --> 15:31.640
is a kind of inhuman ideal.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.680
I mean, there's many ways in which we're not like

15:34.680 --> 15:37.680
the traditional view of what God was.

15:37.680 --> 15:40.800
One is that we're not self-generating.

15:41.680 --> 15:42.520
We have parents.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.520
We're raised into traditions and social norms,

15:48.120 --> 15:51.280
and we're raised into an understanding

15:51.280 --> 15:54.520
of what's appropriate and inappropriate to do.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.120
And I think that's a deep intuition.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.960
I think that's exactly right.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.080
Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre

16:04.080 --> 16:06.080
thinks he's sort of taking this from,

16:06.080 --> 16:08.640
but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant

16:08.640 --> 16:11.560
French misinterpretation of Heidegger's

16:11.560 --> 16:14.840
German phenomenological view.

16:14.840 --> 16:19.600
Heidegger says a crucial aspect of what it is to be us

16:19.600 --> 16:20.800
is our thrownness.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.520
We're thrown into a situation.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.800
We're thrown into history.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.720
We're thrown into our parental lineage.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.160
And we don't choose it.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.640
That's stuff that we don't choose.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.360
We couldn't choose.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.800
If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe,

16:36.800 --> 16:37.760
but we're not.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.480
We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning

16:41.480 --> 16:42.880
that we never chose.

16:42.880 --> 16:47.640
We have an end that we're often trying to resist

16:47.640 --> 16:49.400
or put off or something.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.400
And in between, there's a whole bunch of stuff

16:51.400 --> 16:55.400
that organizes us without our ever having made the choice

16:55.400 --> 16:58.640
and without the kind of being that could make the choice

16:58.640 --> 17:00.680
to allow it to organize us.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.280
We have a complicated relationship to that stuff,

17:04.280 --> 17:06.560
and I think we should talk about that at a certain point,

17:06.600 --> 17:08.600
but the first move is to say,

17:08.600 --> 17:12.360
so Art's just got a sort of descriptive problem.

17:12.360 --> 17:16.360
He's missed this basic fact that there's an awful,

17:16.360 --> 17:20.000
there has to be an awful lot about us

17:20.000 --> 17:24.240
that's settled without our having made the choice

17:24.240 --> 17:25.640
to settle it that way.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.160
Right, the thrownness of life.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.200
Yeah.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.760
That's a fundamental part of life.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.120
You can't just escape it.

17:32.120 --> 17:32.960
Exactly.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.600
You can't escape it altogether.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.440
Altogether.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.280
Yeah, exactly.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.760
But nevertheless, you are riding a wave

17:39.760 --> 17:42.760
and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.080
You can't control the wave, but you should be,

17:46.480 --> 17:48.640
as you ride it, you should be making

17:48.640 --> 17:52.880
certain kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.920
So why does this matter at all,

17:56.920 --> 17:59.320
the chain of decisions you make?

17:59.320 --> 18:01.000
Good, well, because they constitute you.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.080
They make you the person that you are.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.160
So what's the opposite view?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.680
What's this view against?

18:08.680 --> 18:11.520
This view is against most of philosophy

18:11.520 --> 18:12.920
from Plato forward.

18:12.920 --> 18:17.240
Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth,

18:17.240 --> 18:22.240
but he says people will understand their condition well

18:22.560 --> 18:24.640
if we tell them this myth.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.080
He says, look, when you're born,

18:27.080 --> 18:28.840
there's just a fact about you.

18:28.840 --> 18:33.200
Your soul is either gold, silver or bronze.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.040
Those are the three kinds of people there are

18:35.040 --> 18:36.720
and you're born that way.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.880
And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that

18:39.880 --> 18:42.120
and make you a philosopher king.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.760
And if your soul is silver,

18:43.760 --> 18:45.720
well, you're not gonna be a philosopher king.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.280
You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior

18:48.280 --> 18:49.440
and we should make you that.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.840
And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer,

18:51.840 --> 18:53.280
laborer, something like that.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.280
And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever

18:58.760 --> 19:02.520
and for always independent of anything you do about it.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.280
And so that's the alternative view.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.680
And you could have modern versions of it.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.800
You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ

19:10.800 --> 19:15.640
or your genetic makeup or the percentage of fast

19:15.640 --> 19:18.600
which muscle fibers you've got or whatever.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.320
It could be something totally independent

19:21.320 --> 19:23.160
of any choice that you've made,

19:23.160 --> 19:24.440
independent of the kind of thing

19:24.440 --> 19:26.680
about which you could make a choice

19:26.680 --> 19:29.440
and it categorizes you.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.960
It makes you the person that you are.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.200
That's the thing that Sartre

19:32.200 --> 19:34.080
and the existentialists are against.

19:35.320 --> 19:38.600
So this idea that something about you

19:38.600 --> 19:40.920
is forever limiting the space

19:40.920 --> 19:42.480
of possible decisions you can make.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.960
Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.280
Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.760
Radical freedom.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.600
Yeah, radical freedom.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.880
And then you could have other existentialists who say,

19:54.880 --> 19:58.440
look, we are free, but we gotta understand

19:58.480 --> 20:00.400
the way in which our freedom is limited

20:00.400 --> 20:03.600
by certain aspects of the kind of being that we are.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.400
If we were radically free, we really would be like God

20:06.400 --> 20:09.080
in the traditional medieval sense.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.240
And sort of these folks start with the idea

20:12.240 --> 20:16.080
that whatever we are, that's a kind of limit point

20:16.080 --> 20:17.920
that we're not gonna reach.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.280
So what are the ways in which we're constrained

20:21.280 --> 20:25.600
that that being the way the medievals understood him

20:25.600 --> 20:27.040
wasn't constrained?

20:27.040 --> 20:30.000
So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism

20:30.000 --> 20:34.440
and is it at all a useful other sort of group of ideas

20:34.440 --> 20:37.280
that you resist against in defining existentialism?

20:37.280 --> 20:38.640
Yes, good, excellent.

20:38.640 --> 20:43.640
So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular,

20:43.920 --> 20:46.200
although it was used before him is Nietzsche.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.680
Nietzsche is writing in the end of the 19th century

20:48.680 --> 20:53.440
in various places where he published things,

20:53.440 --> 20:56.760
but largely in his unpublished works,

20:56.840 --> 21:01.840
he identifies the condition of the modern world as nihilistic

21:03.360 --> 21:06.720
and that's a descriptive claim.

21:06.720 --> 21:10.000
He's looking around him trying to figure out

21:10.000 --> 21:13.200
what it's like to be us now.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.240
And he says it's a lot different from what it was like

21:17.240 --> 21:22.240
to be human in 1300 or in the fifth century BCE.

21:23.000 --> 21:28.000
In 1300, like what people believed,

21:28.560 --> 21:33.560
the way they lived their lives was in the understanding

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
that to be human was to be created

21:36.320 --> 21:38.360
in the image and likeness of God.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.240
That's the way they understood themselves.

21:40.240 --> 21:45.240
And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's

21:45.480 --> 21:47.760
transgression in the Garden of Eden

21:47.760 --> 21:51.120
and to have the project of trying to understand

21:51.120 --> 21:53.360
how as a sinful being,

21:53.360 --> 21:56.800
you could nevertheless live a life, a virtuous life.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
How could you do that?

21:57.800 --> 21:59.760
And it had to do with for them getting

21:59.760 --> 22:01.440
in the right relation to God.

22:01.440 --> 22:04.760
Nietzsche says, that doesn't make sense to us anymore

22:04.760 --> 22:06.840
in the end of the 19th century.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.920
God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.120
And what does that mean?

22:11.120 --> 22:15.120
Well, it means something like the role that God used to play

22:15.120 --> 22:18.360
in our understanding of ourselves as a culture

22:18.360 --> 22:21.520
isn't a role that God can play anymore.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.400
And so Nietzsche says, the role that God used to play

22:25.400 --> 22:27.800
was the role of grounding our existence.

22:27.800 --> 22:31.440
He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.

22:31.440 --> 22:36.080
And Nietzsche says, the idea that there is a being

22:36.080 --> 22:38.560
that makes us what we are doesn't make sense anymore.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.960
That's like Sartre's atheism.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.560
Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.

22:41.560 --> 22:46.360
And so the question is, what does ground our existence?

22:46.360 --> 22:49.320
And the answer is nihil, nothing.

22:49.320 --> 22:51.720
And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing

22:51.720 --> 22:54.880
outside of us that grounds our existence.

22:54.880 --> 22:57.120
And then Nietzsche asked the question,

22:58.040 --> 22:59.880
well, what are we supposed to do about that?

22:59.880 --> 23:01.240
How do we live?

23:02.160 --> 23:05.680
And I think Nietzsche has a different story

23:05.680 --> 23:07.200
than Sartre about that.

23:07.200 --> 23:12.200
Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.

23:12.920 --> 23:15.120
Nietzsche emphasizes something else.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.800
He says, we're artists of life.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.240
And artists are interesting

23:22.240 --> 23:25.560
because the natural way of thinking about artists

23:25.560 --> 23:28.280
is that they're responding to something.

23:28.280 --> 23:30.840
They find themselves in a situation and they say,

23:30.840 --> 23:32.720
this is what's gonna make sense of the situation.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.600
This is what I have to write.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.200
This is the way I have to dance.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.880
This is the way I've got to play the music.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.760
And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.880
There are constraints, but like understanding what they are

23:45.640 --> 23:50.280
is a complicated aspect of living itself.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.880
And there's a great story, I think, from music

23:53.880 --> 23:57.000
that maybe helps to understand this.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.840
I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist

23:59.840 --> 24:01.400
when Nietzsche was writing,

24:01.400 --> 24:03.640
but I think Nietzsche really is thinking

24:03.640 --> 24:05.920
of something like jazz improvisation.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.320
I mean, he talks about improvisation.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.560
There's classical improvisation.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.480
Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.480
I mean, he was a composer and a pianist,

24:14.480 --> 24:18.880
not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.

24:18.880 --> 24:23.340
And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist,

24:24.240 --> 24:28.000
who played with Miles Davis for quite a while in the 60s,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.040
tells this kind of incredible story

24:31.520 --> 24:35.260
that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's view

24:35.260 --> 24:40.260
about the way in which we bear some responsibility

24:40.700 --> 24:44.260
for being creative and that gives us

24:44.260 --> 24:45.780
a certain kind of freedom,

24:47.240 --> 24:50.700
but we don't have the radical freedom that's art thinks.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.100
So what's the story?

24:52.100 --> 24:57.100
Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says,

24:57.220 --> 25:02.220
playing a show and things were great, he says.

25:02.980 --> 25:07.860
He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.

25:07.860 --> 25:12.020
And he says, I'm back in the solo

25:12.020 --> 25:14.140
and I'm playing these chords.

25:14.140 --> 25:19.140
And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.200
He's like, that's what you gotta say.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.140
It didn't work right there.

25:27.140 --> 25:30.100
And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.660
I screwed up, we were tight, everything was working

25:32.660 --> 25:35.620
and I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.

25:35.660 --> 25:40.380
And he said, Miles paused for a moment

25:41.500 --> 25:45.540
and then all of a sudden he went on

25:45.540 --> 25:49.160
in a way that made my chord right.

25:51.820 --> 25:55.260
And I think that idea that you could be an artist

25:55.260 --> 25:57.220
who responds to what's thrown at you

25:58.140 --> 26:03.140
in such a way as to make it right, by what measure?

26:03.980 --> 26:06.300
Everyone could hear it, is all you can say, right?

26:06.300 --> 26:09.860
Everyone knew, wow, that really works.

26:09.860 --> 26:13.020
And I think that's not like, there are constraints.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.860
Not anything would have worked there.

26:14.860 --> 26:17.500
He couldn't have just played anything.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.900
Most of what anyone would have played

26:19.900 --> 26:21.820
would have sounded terrible.

26:21.820 --> 26:25.180
But the constraints aren't like pre-existing.

26:25.180 --> 26:28.540
They're sort of what's happening now in the moment

26:28.540 --> 26:30.860
for these listeners and these performers.

26:30.980 --> 26:34.060
And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks

26:34.060 --> 26:35.580
the right response to nihilism is.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.540
We're involved, but we're not radically free

26:38.540 --> 26:40.780
to make any choice and just stand behind it,

26:40.780 --> 26:42.220
the way Sartre thinks.

26:42.220 --> 26:45.580
Our choices have to be responsive to our situation

26:45.580 --> 26:48.060
and they have to make the situation work.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.900
They have to make it right.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.140
And there's something about music too.

26:52.140 --> 26:55.020
So you basically have to make music

26:55.020 --> 26:57.260
of all the moments of life.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.180
And there is something about music.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.700
Why is music so compelling?

27:01.700 --> 27:02.860
And when you listen to it,

27:02.860 --> 27:05.140
something about certain kinds of music,

27:05.140 --> 27:06.540
it connects with you.

27:06.540 --> 27:07.540
It doesn't make any sense.

27:07.540 --> 27:10.140
But in that same way, for Nietzsche,

27:10.140 --> 27:12.140
you should be a creative force

27:12.140 --> 27:14.740
that creates a musical masterpiece.

27:14.740 --> 27:15.580
Exactly.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.820
And I think what's interesting is the question,

27:17.820 --> 27:20.380
what does it mean to be a creative force there?

27:20.380 --> 27:23.620
There's a traditional notion of creation

27:23.620 --> 27:26.060
that we associate with God.

27:26.060 --> 27:29.740
God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing.

27:30.580 --> 27:33.380
And you might think that nihilism thinks

27:33.380 --> 27:35.860
that we should do that, create ex nihilo,

27:35.860 --> 27:38.460
because it's about how there's nothing at our ground.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.580
But I think the right way to read Nietzsche

27:40.580 --> 27:43.820
is to recognize that we don't create out of nothing.

27:43.820 --> 27:46.060
Miles Davis wasn't nothing.

27:46.060 --> 27:47.900
That situation preexisted him.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.700
It was given to him.

27:49.700 --> 27:53.140
Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.580
But he was responding to that situation

27:55.580 --> 27:57.460
in a way that made it right.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.540
He wasn't just creating out of nothing.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.620
He was creating out of what was already there.

28:01.620 --> 28:04.020
So that makes that first date with the climbing hand

28:04.020 --> 28:05.180
even more complicated,

28:05.180 --> 28:08.060
because you're given a climbing hand,

28:08.060 --> 28:10.300
you're gonna have to make art and music out of that.

28:10.300 --> 28:11.140
Exactly.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.860
And that's the responsibility for both of them.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.220
Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for a first date,

28:16.220 --> 28:19.580
because you have to create.

28:19.580 --> 28:22.660
The emphasis isn't just on making decisions.

28:22.660 --> 28:25.980
It's on creating.

28:25.980 --> 28:28.300
But also on listening, right?

28:28.300 --> 28:30.620
I mean, Miles Davis was listening.

28:30.620 --> 28:31.740
He heard that.

28:31.740 --> 28:32.820
He knew it was wrong.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.620
And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?

28:37.540 --> 28:41.940
So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?

28:41.940 --> 28:43.700
What did he mean by that statement?

28:43.700 --> 28:47.420
What's in your sense, the truth behind the question

28:47.420 --> 28:49.460
and the possible set of answers

28:49.460 --> 28:52.500
that our world today provides?

28:53.460 --> 28:57.460
I think that there's something super perceptive

28:57.460 --> 29:00.380
about Nietzsche's diagnosis of the condition

29:00.380 --> 29:02.340
at the end of the 19th century.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.500
So not so far from the condition

29:04.500 --> 29:06.340
that I think we're currently in.

29:07.980 --> 29:10.180
And I think there's an interesting question

29:10.180 --> 29:12.540
what we're supposed to do in response.

29:12.540 --> 29:14.820
But what is the condition that we're currently in?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.900
When Nietzsche says God is dead,

29:16.900 --> 29:18.860
that I think, like I was saying before,

29:19.340 --> 29:23.300
he means something like the role that God used to play

29:23.300 --> 29:25.740
in grounding our existence is not a role

29:25.740 --> 29:28.940
that works for us anymore as a culture.

29:28.940 --> 29:33.140
And when people talk about a view like that nowadays,

29:33.140 --> 29:34.660
they use a different terminology,

29:34.660 --> 29:37.660
but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.

29:37.660 --> 29:40.540
They say, we live in a secular age.

29:40.540 --> 29:41.940
Our age is a secular age.

29:41.940 --> 29:44.780
And so what do people mean when they say that?

29:44.780 --> 29:47.580
I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.

29:47.580 --> 29:48.860
It could be wrong.

29:48.860 --> 29:50.820
The question is, does this really describe

29:50.820 --> 29:53.380
the way we experience ourselves as a culture

29:53.380 --> 29:56.220
or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.700
So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age,

29:59.700 --> 30:01.140
an age in which God is dead?

30:01.140 --> 30:02.140
Well, first thing is,

30:02.140 --> 30:04.180
it doesn't mean there are no religious believers

30:04.180 --> 30:05.420
because there are plenty.

30:05.420 --> 30:08.860
There are lots of people who go to church or synagogue

30:08.860 --> 30:11.260
or mosque every week or more.

30:11.260 --> 30:14.980
And there are people who really find that

30:14.980 --> 30:18.180
to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.700
But it does mean that for those people,

30:24.660 --> 30:29.540
the role that their religious belief plays in their life

30:29.540 --> 30:32.340
isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.140
So what's that role?

30:34.140 --> 30:35.740
Well, go back to the high middle ages.

30:35.740 --> 30:38.500
That was clearly not a secular age.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.380
That was a religious age.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.220
And so there we are in 1300.

30:43.220 --> 30:46.260
Dante is writing the Divine Comedy or something.

30:46.260 --> 30:50.460
And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?

30:50.460 --> 30:54.540
Well, it meant not just that the default

30:54.540 --> 30:58.500
was that you were a Christian in the West,

30:58.500 --> 31:01.980
but that your Christianity, your religious belief,

31:01.980 --> 31:06.980
your religious affiliation justified certain assumptions

31:07.700 --> 31:10.940
about people who didn't share that religious belief.

31:10.940 --> 31:15.020
So you're a Christian in the West in 1300,

31:15.020 --> 31:18.780
and you meet someone who's a Muslim.

31:18.780 --> 31:22.140
And the fact that they don't share your religious belief

31:22.140 --> 31:25.980
justifies the conclusion that they're less than human.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.380
And that was the ground of the crusades.

31:30.380 --> 31:33.540
That was the religious wars of the high middle ages.

31:35.580 --> 31:37.740
To say that we live in a secular age

31:37.740 --> 31:40.220
is to say that not that we don't have,

31:40.220 --> 31:41.060
there aren't a lot of people

31:41.060 --> 31:42.660
who have religious belief, there are.

31:42.660 --> 31:45.300
But it's to say that their religious belief

31:45.300 --> 31:48.820
doesn't justify that conclusion.

31:48.820 --> 31:52.540
If you're a religious believer,

31:52.540 --> 31:56.820
and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer,

31:56.820 --> 32:00.500
learning that about me doesn't justify your concluding

32:00.500 --> 32:02.420
that I'm less than human.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.900
And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.

32:05.900 --> 32:08.300
Most of the time we think that's a good thing.

32:08.300 --> 32:10.340
We let a thousand flowers bloom.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.780
There are lots of ways to live a good life.

32:12.780 --> 32:16.580
And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive

32:16.580 --> 32:18.260
kind of liberal thought.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.820
But it's also true that it's an undermining thought,

32:20.820 --> 32:25.780
because it means if you're a religious believer now,

32:26.780 --> 32:31.100
your belief can't ground your understanding

32:31.100 --> 32:33.740
of what you ought to be aiming at in the life

32:33.740 --> 32:35.460
in the way it used to be able to.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.380
You can't say, as a religious believer,

32:38.380 --> 32:40.420
I know it's right to do this,

32:40.420 --> 32:42.700
because you also know that if you meet someone

32:42.700 --> 32:44.340
who doesn't share that religious belief,

32:44.340 --> 32:47.060
and so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily,

32:47.060 --> 32:49.380
or does but for different reasons,

32:49.380 --> 32:52.780
you can't conclude that they've got it wrong.

32:52.780 --> 32:56.140
So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.340
Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude

32:59.340 --> 33:02.620
as a public statement to others,

33:02.620 --> 33:05.180
but within your own mind,

33:05.180 --> 33:10.060
it's almost like an existentialist version of belief,

33:10.060 --> 33:15.060
which is like, you create the world around you.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.700
It doesn't matter what others believe.

33:19.300 --> 33:23.540
It's actually almost like empowering thought,

33:23.540 --> 33:28.260
so as opposed to the more traditional view of religion,

33:28.260 --> 33:30.900
where it's like a tribal idea,

33:30.940 --> 33:33.020
like where you share that idea together.

33:33.020 --> 33:35.860
Here you have the full, back to Sartre,

33:35.860 --> 33:38.900
full responsibility of your beliefs as well.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.500
Good, good, but what you're describing

33:41.500 --> 33:44.260
is not a religious believer, right?

33:44.260 --> 33:47.820
You're describing someone who's found in themselves

33:47.820 --> 33:49.100
the ground of their existence,

33:49.100 --> 33:51.020
rather than in something outside of themselves.

33:51.020 --> 33:54.860
So the religious belief, I mean, if you go full Sartrean,

33:54.860 --> 33:59.540
then, well, you're not in a position to criticize others

33:59.580 --> 34:02.020
for the choices that they make,

34:02.020 --> 34:04.780
but you are in a position to criticize them

34:04.780 --> 34:06.700
for the way in which they make them,

34:06.700 --> 34:10.300
either taking responsibility or not taking responsibility.

34:10.300 --> 34:13.500
But the religious believer used to be able to say,

34:13.500 --> 34:15.660
look, the choices that I make are right

34:15.660 --> 34:17.900
because God demands that I make them.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.580
And so it would be wrong to make any others.

34:25.580 --> 34:30.420
And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age,

34:30.420 --> 34:32.980
just to say, well, you can't quite do that

34:32.980 --> 34:33.940
and be a religious believer.

34:33.940 --> 34:37.620
Your religious belief can't justify that move,

34:37.620 --> 34:40.900
and so it can't ground your life in the way it does.

34:40.900 --> 34:42.260
So it's sort of unsettling.

34:42.260 --> 34:44.780
I think that's one of the interpretations

34:44.780 --> 34:46.260
of what Nietzsche might have meant

34:46.260 --> 34:47.780
when he said God is dead.

34:47.780 --> 34:50.380
God can't play the role for religious believers

34:50.380 --> 34:52.620
in our world that he used to.

34:52.700 --> 34:54.740
But we nevertheless find meaning.

34:54.740 --> 34:59.140
I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas

34:59.140 --> 35:00.620
that are overtaken modern culture.

35:00.620 --> 35:04.220
So a secular world is still full of meaning.

35:04.220 --> 35:06.620
Good, well, I think that's the interesting question.

35:06.620 --> 35:10.300
I think it's certainly possible for a secular world

35:10.300 --> 35:13.180
to be a world in which we live meaningful lives,

35:13.180 --> 35:18.180
worthwhile lives, lives that are sort of worthy of respect

35:18.980 --> 35:23.900
and that we can be proud of aiming to live.

35:23.900 --> 35:26.300
But I think it is a hard question,

35:26.300 --> 35:27.900
what we're doing when we do that.

35:27.900 --> 35:30.620
And that is the question of existence.

35:30.620 --> 35:33.500
So what does it mean to exist in a way

35:33.500 --> 35:36.780
that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?

35:36.780 --> 35:38.940
That's the question for existentialism.

35:40.820 --> 35:45.820
So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important

35:46.500 --> 35:49.180
existentialist to understand for others?

35:49.180 --> 35:52.020
What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?

35:52.020 --> 35:54.940
Maybe other existentialists, not just one.

35:54.940 --> 35:55.780
Yeah, good.

35:55.780 --> 35:57.220
So Sartre is the grounding,

35:57.220 --> 36:00.620
strong atheistic existentialism statement.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.580
Who else is there?

36:02.580 --> 36:05.500
So I'm teaching an existentialism course now.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.780
And I think the tradition goes back

36:07.780 --> 36:09.660
at least to the 17th century.

36:10.620 --> 36:12.420
And I'll just tell you some of the figures

36:12.420 --> 36:13.780
that I'm teaching there.

36:13.820 --> 36:16.380
We can talk about any of them that you like.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.940
The figure I start with is Pascal.

36:18.940 --> 36:23.940
Pascal, French mathematician from the 17th century.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.020
He died, I'm terrible with dates,

36:26.020 --> 36:28.780
but I think 1661 or something like that,

36:28.780 --> 36:30.620
middle of the 17th century.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.660
Brilliant polymath sort of,

36:32.660 --> 36:34.860
we have computer languages named after him.

36:34.860 --> 36:38.900
He built the first mechanical calculating machine.

36:38.900 --> 36:43.300
But he was also deeply invested in his understanding

36:43.300 --> 36:45.820
of what Christianity was.

36:45.820 --> 36:50.820
And he thought that everyone before him

36:50.820 --> 36:53.940
had really misunderstood what Christianity was.

36:53.940 --> 36:57.620
That they'd really attempted to think about it,

36:57.620 --> 37:00.780
not as a way of living a life,

37:00.780 --> 37:04.060
but as a set of beliefs that you can have

37:04.060 --> 37:06.460
and which you can justify.

37:06.460 --> 37:09.660
And I think that's the first move

37:09.660 --> 37:11.860
that's really pretty interesting.

37:11.860 --> 37:15.380
And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky

37:15.380 --> 37:16.620
developed that move.

37:16.620 --> 37:20.580
And all of those take themselves to be defending

37:20.580 --> 37:23.820
an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity,

37:23.820 --> 37:27.260
an existential interpretation of Christianity.

37:27.260 --> 37:28.940
And then I think there are other figures,

37:28.940 --> 37:30.900
other theistic figures,

37:30.900 --> 37:34.620
figures like Camus and Fanon,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.820
who are mid 20th century figures.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.980
And then I'll just mention the figure

37:40.020 --> 37:42.940
who I think is the most interesting is Martin Heidegger.

37:42.940 --> 37:44.460
He's a complicated figure.

37:45.540 --> 37:48.220
By the way, when you said, sorry to interrupt,

37:48.220 --> 37:51.820
that when you said Camus, you meant atheistic.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.260
I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist.

37:54.260 --> 37:55.900
Yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.380
So, okay, so we got, it's like sports cards.

37:58.380 --> 37:59.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:59.220 --> 38:00.060
They have the different existentialists.

38:00.060 --> 38:04.300
So maybe let's go to, you know what,

38:04.300 --> 38:05.660
let's go to Dostoevsky.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.420
All right, okay, let's do it.

38:07.420 --> 38:10.940
So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.

38:10.940 --> 38:15.260
First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.

38:15.260 --> 38:19.300
And I love the optimism and the love

38:19.300 --> 38:22.100
the main character has for the world.

38:22.100 --> 38:25.620
So that just deeply connects with me as a novel,

38:25.620 --> 38:27.500
notes from underground as well.

38:27.500 --> 38:32.100
But what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think

38:32.100 --> 38:33.180
are existentialist?

38:33.180 --> 38:34.740
What ideas are formative

38:34.740 --> 38:36.380
to the whole existentialist movement?

38:36.380 --> 38:37.220
Excellent.

38:37.220 --> 38:40.020
So let me talk about The Brothers Karamazov,

38:40.020 --> 38:43.500
partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.380
I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels

38:45.380 --> 38:48.340
of the 19th century, maybe the best.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.980
And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.

38:49.980 --> 38:52.340
So I'm super excited about it.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.820
But what is The Brothers Karamazov about?

38:54.820 --> 38:58.580
I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.

38:58.580 --> 38:59.420
Spoiler alert.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.900
Yeah, I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?

39:02.900 --> 39:05.220
I mean, the father gets murdered.

39:06.220 --> 39:07.980
And the question is, who did it?

39:07.980 --> 39:09.460
Who's responsible for it?

39:09.460 --> 39:12.740
So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.260
But it's responsibility for a murder.

39:15.260 --> 39:17.140
That's what we're talking about.

39:17.140 --> 39:19.900
And there's a bunch of brothers,

39:19.900 --> 39:24.220
each of whom has pretty good motivation

39:24.220 --> 39:26.780
for having murdered the father.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.100
The father's a jerk.

39:28.100 --> 39:32.500
I mean, if anybody is worthy of being murdered,

39:32.500 --> 39:35.980
he's the guy, he's a force of chaos,

39:35.980 --> 39:38.540
and he's nasty in all sorts of ways.

39:39.820 --> 39:43.660
But still, it's not good to murder people.

39:43.660 --> 39:46.300
So what's the view of Dostoevsky?

39:46.300 --> 39:49.180
I mean, it's this intense exploration

39:49.180 --> 39:54.180
of what it means to be involved in various ways

39:54.220 --> 39:58.500
with an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.

39:59.500 --> 40:04.500
And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?

40:05.220 --> 40:09.980
What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?

40:09.980 --> 40:14.020
And how, even through this kind of action,

40:14.020 --> 40:16.620
you can achieve some kind of salvation.

40:16.620 --> 40:18.660
That's Dostoevsky's word for it.

40:19.700 --> 40:22.460
But salvation here and now,

40:22.460 --> 40:24.500
not like you live some afterlife

40:24.500 --> 40:27.860
where you're paradise for eternity.

40:27.860 --> 40:31.060
Who cares about that, says one of the characters.

40:31.060 --> 40:33.620
That doesn't make my life now any good,

40:33.620 --> 40:35.860
and it doesn't justify any of the bad things

40:35.860 --> 40:37.140
that happen in my life now.

40:37.140 --> 40:40.220
What matters is can we live well

40:40.220 --> 40:42.460
in the face of these things that we do

40:42.460 --> 40:43.900
and have to take responsibility for?

40:43.900 --> 40:48.420
So it's this intense exploration of notions

40:48.420 --> 40:52.020
and gradations of guilt and responsibility

40:52.020 --> 40:55.060
and the possibility of love and salvation

40:55.060 --> 40:56.140
in the face of those.

40:56.140 --> 40:58.780
It is incredibly human work.

40:59.780 --> 41:03.060
But I think Dostoevsky is the opposite of Sartre.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.700
And let me just, I think it's so fascinating.

41:05.700 --> 41:07.780
I don't know anybody else who notices this,

41:07.780 --> 41:11.900
but Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoevsky

41:11.900 --> 41:13.620
when he's developing his view.

41:14.780 --> 41:15.940
It's close to a passage.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.980
It doesn't appear quite in this way.

41:17.980 --> 41:21.540
But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.020
It's in the form of an argument.

41:23.020 --> 41:24.620
Sartre puts it in the form of an argument.

41:24.620 --> 41:28.820
He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.

41:29.700 --> 41:32.140
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

41:33.580 --> 41:36.220
And then there's a second premise.

41:36.220 --> 41:37.700
There is no God.

41:37.700 --> 41:38.940
That's Sartre's view.

41:38.940 --> 41:40.100
I mean, he's an atheist.

41:40.100 --> 41:41.340
There is no God.

41:41.340 --> 41:42.980
Conclusion?

41:42.980 --> 41:44.900
Everything is permitted.

41:44.900 --> 41:46.740
And that's Sartre's radical freedom.

41:47.660 --> 41:49.700
And if you think about the structure

41:49.700 --> 41:51.260
of the Brothers Karamazov,

41:51.260 --> 41:54.500
I think Dostoevsky, though he never says it this way,

41:55.340 --> 41:57.260
would run the argument differently.

41:57.260 --> 42:00.340
It's a modus tollens instead of a modus ponens.

42:00.340 --> 42:03.420
The argument for Dostoevsky would go like this.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.020
Yeah, conditional statement.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.900
If there is no God, then everything is permitted.

42:07.900 --> 42:10.100
But look at your life.

42:10.100 --> 42:12.700
Not everything is permitted.

42:12.700 --> 42:15.340
You do horrible, atrocious things,

42:15.340 --> 42:18.540
like be involved in the death of your father,

42:18.540 --> 42:20.140
and there is a price to pay.

42:20.140 --> 42:22.820
That's not a livable moment.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.140
To have to take responsibility,

42:25.140 --> 42:28.780
to have to recognize that you're at fault

42:28.780 --> 42:32.540
or you're somehow guilty for having been involved

42:32.540 --> 42:34.780
in whatever way you were in letting that happen

42:34.780 --> 42:36.900
or bringing it about that it does happen,

42:36.900 --> 42:38.660
is to pay a price.

42:38.660 --> 42:42.740
So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way

42:42.740 --> 42:44.460
that everything is permitted.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.900
Look at the facts of your existence.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.660
So not everything is permitted.

42:49.540 --> 42:51.780
Therefore, there is a God.

42:53.780 --> 42:57.340
And the presence of a God for Dostoevsky,

42:57.340 --> 42:59.900
I think, is just found in this fact

42:59.900 --> 43:02.820
that when we do bad things, we feel guilty for them,

43:02.820 --> 43:05.900
that we find ourselves to be responsible for things,

43:05.900 --> 43:07.700
even when we didn't intend to do them,

43:07.700 --> 43:09.900
but we just allowed ourselves to be involved in them.

43:09.900 --> 43:14.300
And the nature of God for Dostoevsky is, I mean, unclear.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.940
I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.

43:16.940 --> 43:19.860
And he basically, God speaks through several

43:19.860 --> 43:22.860
of his characters in complicated ways.

43:22.860 --> 43:26.300
So it's not like a trivial version of God.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.420
It's totally not trivial.

43:27.420 --> 43:30.860
And it's not a being that exists outside of time.

43:30.860 --> 43:33.700
And none of that is sort of relevant for Dostoevsky.

43:33.700 --> 43:36.620
For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.

43:36.620 --> 43:38.060
Do we live our lives in the mood

43:38.060 --> 43:40.380
that Christianity says it makes available to us,

43:40.380 --> 43:41.620
which is the mood of joy?

43:43.820 --> 43:45.300
Maybe this is a bit of a tangent,

43:45.300 --> 43:47.380
but so I'm a Russian speaker.

43:47.500 --> 43:52.340
And one of the, I kind of listen to my heart.

43:52.340 --> 43:55.580
And what my heart says is I need to take on this project.

43:55.580 --> 43:59.020
So there's a couple of famous translators

43:59.020 --> 44:03.860
of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy that live in Paris currently.

44:03.860 --> 44:06.220
So I'm going to take the journey.

44:06.220 --> 44:09.900
We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoevsky,

44:09.900 --> 44:14.700
about Tolstoy, and like a series of conversations.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.820
And the reason I fell in love with this idea

44:17.740 --> 44:21.220
is I just realized in translating from Russian to English,

44:22.220 --> 44:25.700
how deep philosophical,

44:25.700 --> 44:29.100
how much deep philosophical thinking is required.

44:29.100 --> 44:31.100
Just to keep like single sentences.

44:31.100 --> 44:35.300
They spent like weeks debating single sentences.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.660
So, and all of that is part of a journey

44:38.660 --> 44:40.140
to Russia for several reasons.

44:40.140 --> 44:44.100
But I just, I want to explore something in me

44:44.100 --> 44:49.020
that longs to understand and to connect with the roots

44:49.020 --> 44:50.020
where I come from.

44:51.700 --> 44:55.580
So maybe can you comment whether it's on the Russian side

44:55.580 --> 45:00.580
or the German side or other French side?

45:01.660 --> 45:04.580
Is there something in your own explorations

45:04.580 --> 45:08.220
of these philosophies that you find that you miss

45:08.220 --> 45:11.420
because you don't deeply know the language?

45:11.460 --> 45:14.620
Or like how important is it to understand the language?

45:14.620 --> 45:15.540
Good.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.660
I think it's super important and I'm always embarrassed

45:18.660 --> 45:20.020
that I don't know more languages

45:20.020 --> 45:21.980
and don't know the languages I know

45:21.980 --> 45:23.740
as well as I would like to.

45:23.740 --> 45:26.140
But there's a way in.

45:26.140 --> 45:29.420
So I do think different languages allow you

45:29.420 --> 45:30.740
to think in different ways.

45:30.740 --> 45:33.140
And that there's a sort of a mode of exist,

45:33.140 --> 45:37.100
a way of being that's captured by a language

45:37.100 --> 45:39.940
that it makes certain ways of thinking about yourself

45:39.940 --> 45:41.580
or others more natural.

45:41.580 --> 45:44.420
And it closes off other ways of thinking

45:44.420 --> 45:46.500
about yourself and others.

45:46.500 --> 45:51.140
And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.

45:51.140 --> 45:53.900
The Heidegger who is this philosopher

45:53.900 --> 45:56.140
that I'm interested in says at one point,

45:56.140 --> 45:58.860
language is the house of being.

45:58.860 --> 46:01.180
And I think that means something like,

46:02.300 --> 46:07.300
it's by living in a language that you come to understand

46:08.020 --> 46:09.940
or that possibilities for understanding

46:09.940 --> 46:14.460
what it is to be you and others and anything are opened up.

46:14.460 --> 46:16.740
And different languages open up different possibilities.

46:16.740 --> 46:19.540
And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce,

46:19.540 --> 46:22.180
how I took a course in James Joyce

46:22.180 --> 46:24.300
and how I don't think I understood anything

46:24.300 --> 46:27.020
besides the dead and the short stories.

46:27.020 --> 46:30.300
And you suggested that it might be helpful

46:30.300 --> 46:33.300
to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin

46:33.300 --> 46:35.180
to truly, to help you understand,

46:35.180 --> 46:37.340
maybe fall in love with the words.

46:37.340 --> 46:42.180
And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding

46:42.180 --> 46:44.420
of the actual words of the language.

46:44.420 --> 46:47.300
It's understanding something much deeper,

46:47.300 --> 46:50.100
the music of the language or something,

46:50.100 --> 46:52.300
music of the ideas.

46:52.300 --> 46:53.980
Absolutely, something like that.

46:53.980 --> 46:56.020
It's very hard to say exactly what that is.

46:56.020 --> 46:58.220
But when you hear an Irish person

46:58.220 --> 47:01.820
who really understands Joyce read some sentences,

47:01.820 --> 47:03.140
they have a different cadence,

47:03.140 --> 47:04.780
they have a different tonality,

47:05.380 --> 47:07.260
they have different music to use your word.

47:07.260 --> 47:10.620
And all of a sudden you think about them differently

47:10.620 --> 47:14.140
and the sentences sort of draw different thoughts out of you

47:14.140 --> 47:15.460
when they're read in certain ways.

47:15.460 --> 47:18.020
That's what great actors can do.

47:18.020 --> 47:22.380
But I think language is rich like that.

47:22.380 --> 47:26.540
And the idea which philosophers tend to have

47:26.540 --> 47:30.580
that we're really studying the crucial aspects of language

47:30.580 --> 47:33.020
when we think about its logical form,

47:33.060 --> 47:35.420
when we think about the sort of claims

47:35.420 --> 47:37.340
of philosophical logic that you can make

47:37.340 --> 47:39.500
or how do you translate this proposition

47:39.500 --> 47:41.660
into some symbolic form.

47:41.660 --> 47:44.100
I think that's part of what goes on in language.

47:44.100 --> 47:47.580
But I think that when language affects us

47:47.580 --> 47:49.860
in the deep way that it can,

47:49.860 --> 47:54.180
when great poets or great writers or great thinkers

47:54.180 --> 47:58.180
use it to great effect, it's way more than that.

47:58.180 --> 47:59.940
And that's the interesting form of language

47:59.940 --> 48:00.980
that I'm interested in.

48:00.980 --> 48:03.380
It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on

48:03.380 --> 48:06.500
is I feel like some of the ideas

48:07.420 --> 48:09.300
that are conveyed through language

48:09.300 --> 48:11.380
actually can be put outside of language.

48:11.380 --> 48:13.700
So one of the challenges I have to do

48:13.700 --> 48:17.260
is to have a conversation with people in Russian,

48:17.260 --> 48:19.780
but for an English audience

48:19.780 --> 48:21.900
and not rely purely on translators.

48:21.900 --> 48:23.620
There would of course be translators there

48:23.620 --> 48:28.620
that help me dance through this mess of language,

48:28.780 --> 48:33.700
but also my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian

48:33.700 --> 48:37.460
to English back and forth for an English speaking audience

48:37.460 --> 48:38.940
and for a Russian speaking audience.

48:38.940 --> 48:41.300
So not this pure, this is Russian,

48:41.300 --> 48:43.260
it's going to be translated to English,

48:43.260 --> 48:45.980
or this is English, it's going to be translated to Russian,

48:45.980 --> 48:49.860
but dance back and forth and try to share with people

48:49.860 --> 48:52.580
who don't speak one of the languages

48:52.580 --> 48:54.100
the music that they're missing

48:54.100 --> 48:56.300
and sort of almost hear that music

48:56.300 --> 48:58.340
as if you're sitting in another room

48:59.020 --> 49:00.380
and you hear the music through the wall.

49:00.380 --> 49:01.740
I get a sense of it.

49:01.740 --> 49:03.580
I think that would be a waste

49:03.580 --> 49:08.060
if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.

49:08.060 --> 49:10.860
And I wonder whether it's possible

49:10.860 --> 49:13.380
to capture some of the magic of the ideas

49:14.340 --> 49:16.020
in a way that can be conveyed

49:16.020 --> 49:18.980
to people who don't speak that particular language.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.980
I think it's a super exciting project.

49:20.980 --> 49:23.340
I look forward to following it.

49:23.340 --> 49:25.620
I'll tell you one thing that does happen.

49:25.620 --> 49:27.860
So we read Dostoevsky in translation.

49:27.860 --> 49:29.900
Occasionally, I do have Russian speakers in the room,

49:29.900 --> 49:31.740
which is super helpful.

49:31.740 --> 49:34.100
But I also encourage my students to,

49:37.220 --> 49:39.380
some of them will have different translations than others.

49:39.380 --> 49:43.500
And that can be really helpful for the non-native speaker

49:43.500 --> 49:48.380
because by paying attention to the places

49:48.380 --> 49:51.420
where translators diverge in their translations

49:51.420 --> 49:53.740
of a given word or a phrase or something like that,

49:53.740 --> 49:55.540
you can start to get the idea

49:55.540 --> 49:58.940
that somehow the words that we have in English,

49:58.940 --> 50:00.540
they don't have the same contours

50:00.540 --> 50:03.100
as the word in Russian that's being translated.

50:03.100 --> 50:04.340
And then you can start to ask

50:04.340 --> 50:07.220
about what those differences are.

50:07.220 --> 50:11.260
And I think there's a kind of magic to it.

50:11.260 --> 50:15.540
I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting

50:15.540 --> 50:16.980
these languages can be for people

50:16.980 --> 50:20.380
who grew up in them especially, who speak them as natives.

50:20.380 --> 50:21.660
And that's a really powerful thing

50:21.660 --> 50:24.300
that actually doesn't exist enough of

50:24.300 --> 50:27.460
is for example, for Dostoyevsky,

50:27.460 --> 50:29.180
most novels have been translated

50:29.180 --> 50:33.300
by two or three famous translators.

50:33.300 --> 50:35.500
And there's a lot of discussions

50:35.500 --> 50:37.340
about who did it better and so on.

50:37.340 --> 50:40.300
But I would love to, I'm a computer science person,

50:40.300 --> 50:41.860
I would love to do a diff

50:41.860 --> 50:45.820
where you automatically detect all the differences

50:45.820 --> 50:49.220
in the translation just as you're saying and use that.

50:49.220 --> 50:54.140
Like somebody needs to publish literally just books,

50:54.180 --> 50:56.180
describing the differences.

50:56.180 --> 50:58.060
In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.

50:58.060 --> 50:59.940
I heard the individual translators

50:59.940 --> 51:02.700
in interviews and in blog posts and articles

51:02.700 --> 51:06.480
discuss particular phrases that they differ on.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.260
But like to do that for an entire book,

51:08.260 --> 51:10.580
that's a fascinating exploration.

51:10.580 --> 51:11.820
As an English speaker,

51:11.820 --> 51:15.260
just read the differences in the translations.

51:15.260 --> 51:18.780
You probably can get some deep understanding

51:18.780 --> 51:21.780
of ideas in those books

51:21.780 --> 51:24.700
by seeing the struggle of the translators

51:24.700 --> 51:26.220
to capture that idea.

51:26.220 --> 51:28.020
That's a really interesting idea, yeah.

51:28.020 --> 51:30.260
Absolutely, and you can do that

51:30.260 --> 51:32.500
for other projects in other languages too.

51:32.500 --> 51:34.780
I mean, one of the, I don't know,

51:34.780 --> 51:37.620
I have this weird, huge range of interests

51:37.620 --> 51:40.940
and some days I'll find myself reading about something.

51:40.940 --> 51:42.340
At one point I was interested

51:42.340 --> 51:46.180
in 14th century German mysticism.

51:46.180 --> 51:47.860
Okay, turns out there's somebody

51:47.860 --> 51:50.540
who's written like volumes and volumes about this.

51:50.580 --> 51:53.260
He's fantastic, and I was interested

51:53.260 --> 51:55.540
in reading Meister Eckhart.

51:55.540 --> 51:58.460
I wanted to know what was interesting about him.

51:58.460 --> 52:02.980
And the sort of move that this guy, Bernard McGinn,

52:02.980 --> 52:05.220
who's the great scholar of this period, made

52:05.220 --> 52:09.940
was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this,

52:09.940 --> 52:12.740
he translated Christianity into the vernacular.

52:12.740 --> 52:15.980
He started giving sermons in German to the passengers.

52:15.980 --> 52:18.100
Sermons used to be in Latin and nobody could speak Latin.

52:18.100 --> 52:19.980
Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon

52:19.980 --> 52:22.380
in a language that you don't know?

52:22.380 --> 52:25.580
So he translated it into German.

52:25.580 --> 52:27.940
But in doing it, the resources of the German language

52:27.940 --> 52:30.220
are different from the resources of the Latin language.

52:30.220 --> 52:34.420
And there's a word in middle high German, grunt,

52:34.420 --> 52:37.820
which is like, we translate it as ground.

52:37.820 --> 52:41.500
And it's got this earthy feel to it.

52:41.500 --> 52:43.980
It sort of invokes the notion of soil

52:43.980 --> 52:47.220
and what you stand on and what things grow out of

52:47.220 --> 52:51.180
and sort of what you could run your fingers through

52:51.180 --> 52:54.220
that would have a kind of honesty to it.

52:54.220 --> 52:56.980
And there's no Latin word for that.

52:56.980 --> 53:00.580
But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, grunt,

53:00.580 --> 53:02.540
that's like the fundamental thing.

53:02.540 --> 53:04.540
You don't understand God until you understand

53:04.540 --> 53:07.060
the way in which he is our ground.

53:07.060 --> 53:10.100
And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets

53:10.100 --> 53:14.020
a kind of German cant that makes sense

53:14.020 --> 53:16.340
to the people who speak German

53:16.340 --> 53:19.660
and that reveals something totally different

53:19.660 --> 53:23.220
about what you could think that form of existence was

53:23.220 --> 53:24.860
that was covered over by the fact

53:24.860 --> 53:26.740
that it had always been done in Latin.

53:27.700 --> 53:29.460
Yeah, that's fascinating.

53:29.460 --> 53:32.940
So, okay, we talked about Dostoevsky

53:32.940 --> 53:36.220
and the use of murder to explore human nature.

53:36.220 --> 53:40.020
Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder

53:40.020 --> 53:42.180
and more concerned with suicide

53:42.180 --> 53:44.100
as a way to explore human nature.

53:44.100 --> 53:47.620
So he is probably my favorite existentialist,

53:47.620 --> 53:52.340
probably one of the more accessible existentialists.

53:52.340 --> 53:55.540
And like you said, one of the people

53:55.540 --> 53:58.620
who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.

53:58.620 --> 54:00.940
So what are your thoughts about Camus?

54:00.940 --> 54:03.820
What role does he play in the story of existentialism?

54:03.820 --> 54:07.220
So I find Camus totally fascinating, I really do.

54:07.220 --> 54:10.540
And for years, I didn't teach Camus

54:10.540 --> 54:14.180
because the famous thing that you're referring to,

54:14.180 --> 54:16.940
The Myth of Sisyphus, which is a sort of essay,

54:16.940 --> 54:19.860
it's published as a book, super accessible,

54:19.860 --> 54:23.900
really fascinating, he's a great writer, really engaging.

54:23.900 --> 54:26.540
The opening line is something like,

54:26.540 --> 54:31.540
there is but one truly significant philosophical question

54:31.540 --> 54:34.020
and that is the question of suicide.

54:34.020 --> 54:37.020
And I thought, I can't teach my 18 year olds,

54:37.700 --> 54:41.540
how, I just thought that's terrible.

54:41.540 --> 54:45.340
Like, how can I, I mean, it's not wrong,

54:45.340 --> 54:47.780
but do I wanna bring that into the classroom?

54:47.780 --> 54:50.980
And so I read it, I read the essay,

54:50.980 --> 54:54.820
I avoided it for a long time, just because of that line.

54:54.820 --> 54:57.100
And I thought, I'm not gonna be able to make sense of this

54:57.100 --> 54:59.740
in a way that will be helpful for anyone.

54:59.740 --> 55:02.500
But finally one year, maybe seven or eight years ago,

55:02.500 --> 55:03.820
I sat down to read it.

55:03.820 --> 55:06.900
I thought, I've got to really confront it.

55:07.780 --> 55:10.580
And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.

55:10.580 --> 55:12.580
I mean, it's really, really beautiful.

55:12.580 --> 55:14.740
And Kemu was against suicide,

55:14.740 --> 55:19.220
which just turns out to be good, I was happy about that.

55:19.220 --> 55:23.180
But he has a bit of a bleak understanding

55:23.180 --> 55:26.180
of what human existence amounts to.

55:26.180 --> 55:31.020
And so in the end, he thinks that human existence

55:31.020 --> 55:34.060
is absurd and it's being absurd

55:34.060 --> 55:36.660
is a kind of technical term for him.

55:36.660 --> 55:41.220
And it means that the episodes in your life

55:42.700 --> 55:44.700
and your life as a whole,

55:44.700 --> 55:48.060
presents itself to you as if it's got a meaning,

55:49.140 --> 55:50.180
but really it doesn't.

55:51.260 --> 55:56.260
So there's this tension between the way things seem to be

55:56.420 --> 56:00.340
on their surface and what really turns out

56:00.340 --> 56:02.820
to be true about them.

56:02.820 --> 56:05.580
And he gives these great examples.

56:05.580 --> 56:06.780
You probably remember these.

56:06.780 --> 56:11.380
He says, there you are, you're walking along the street

56:11.380 --> 56:13.900
and there's a plate glass window in a building

56:13.900 --> 56:15.860
and through the window,

56:15.860 --> 56:18.500
you see somebody talking on a cell phone.

56:18.500 --> 56:22.420
I mean, I imagine it as a cell phone, but Kemu didn't.

56:23.460 --> 56:25.220
But you see somebody talking on a cell phone

56:25.220 --> 56:28.780
and he's animated, he's talking a lot

56:28.780 --> 56:31.740
as if things really meant something.

56:31.740 --> 56:35.100
And yet Kemu says, it's a dumb show.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.260
And it's not dumb just in the sense that it's stupid.

56:39.260 --> 56:41.740
It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.

56:41.740 --> 56:44.940
It presents itself as if it's got some significance

56:44.940 --> 56:47.300
and yet its significance is withheld from you.

56:47.300 --> 56:49.620
And he says, that's what our lives are like.

56:49.620 --> 56:52.220
Everything in our lives presents themselves to us

56:52.220 --> 56:56.300
as if it's got a significance, but it doesn't, it's absurd.

56:56.300 --> 56:59.660
And then he says, really what our lives are like

56:59.660 --> 57:01.740
they're like the lives of Sisyphus.

57:01.740 --> 57:06.740
Just day after day, you do the same thing.

57:07.420 --> 57:10.020
You wake up at a certain time, you get on the bus,

57:10.020 --> 57:13.820
you go to work, you take your lunch break, you get off.

57:13.820 --> 57:17.500
I have a colleague who once said to me something like this,

57:17.500 --> 57:20.380
it was about October or so in the fall semester.

57:20.380 --> 57:22.660
I said, how's it going, Dick?

57:22.660 --> 57:24.060
He said, well, you know how it is.

57:24.060 --> 57:27.340
I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester

57:27.340 --> 57:29.660
and I'm just going through.

57:29.660 --> 57:32.060
And that's the way my life is.

57:32.060 --> 57:34.780
And Camus thinks that experience,

57:34.780 --> 57:38.980
which you can sometimes have reveals something true

57:38.980 --> 57:41.220
about what human lives are like.

57:41.220 --> 57:44.140
Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus

57:44.140 --> 57:48.060
who rolls this boulder up the hill from morning till night.

57:48.060 --> 57:50.620
And then at night he gets to the top

57:50.620 --> 57:52.940
and it rolls back down to the bottom.

57:52.940 --> 57:55.260
Over the course of the night, he walks back down

57:55.260 --> 57:57.460
and then he starts it all over again.

57:57.460 --> 58:00.380
And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life,

58:00.380 --> 58:03.580
like we're condemned to our lives,

58:03.580 --> 58:06.500
but we do have one bit of freedom.

58:06.500 --> 58:09.140
And it's the only thing that we can hang on to.

58:10.180 --> 58:14.100
It's the freedom to stick it to the gods

58:14.100 --> 58:19.100
who put us in this position by embracing this existence

58:19.220 --> 58:21.380
rather than giving up and committing suicide.

58:21.380 --> 58:24.860
And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending.

58:25.380 --> 58:30.380
But I also thought it's a dim view

58:30.380 --> 58:33.140
of what our existence amounts to.

58:33.140 --> 58:37.340
So I think there's something fascinating about that.

58:37.340 --> 58:40.020
But what I came to believe,

58:40.020 --> 58:41.660
and I tried to write about this once.

58:41.660 --> 58:44.380
I know you read the thing about aliveness

58:44.380 --> 58:45.780
that I published once.

58:45.780 --> 58:48.020
That's secretly a criticism of Camus.

58:48.020 --> 58:50.220
I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.

58:50.220 --> 58:53.700
But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong

58:53.700 --> 58:56.460
or he's missed some important aspect of it.

58:56.460 --> 59:00.300
Because in Camus' view, when you experience your day

59:00.300 --> 59:03.020
as sort of going on in this deadening way

59:03.020 --> 59:05.300
and you're just doing the things that you always do,

59:05.300 --> 59:07.460
the way you always do them,

59:07.460 --> 59:11.940
for Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.

59:11.940 --> 59:14.260
But I think there's some aspect, at least for me,

59:14.260 --> 59:16.900
and maybe he just didn't feel this

59:16.900 --> 59:18.940
or didn't have access to it.

59:18.940 --> 59:20.340
Maybe others don't.

59:20.340 --> 59:22.620
But for me, there's an extra part to it,

59:22.620 --> 59:26.500
which is somehow that, yes, that's the way things are,

59:27.500 --> 59:29.340
and it's inadequate.

59:29.340 --> 59:33.020
And there's something that's missing

59:33.020 --> 59:36.940
from that aspect of our existence that could be there.

59:37.940 --> 59:40.540
And it feels like our lives are not about

59:40.540 --> 59:42.340
just putting up with that

59:42.340 --> 59:45.580
and sticking it to the gods by embracing it,

59:45.580 --> 59:48.780
but seeking that absent part of it,

59:48.780 --> 59:52.620
the part that's recognizable in its absence

59:52.620 --> 59:54.580
in your experience of that.

59:54.580 --> 59:56.820
And that's what I think,

59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.140
I think we do have the experience of the presence of that

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:04.340
in moments when you feel truly alive.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.380
And that's what you mean by the word aliveness,

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.940
which is a fascinating and a powerful word.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.500
Yeah, that's what I mean by it.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.740
I mean, I think most people can recognize moments

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:17.460
in their lives when they really felt alive,

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.980
and it could happen in a moment when,

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:23.700
I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:26.700
when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.260
Or maybe you feel it in that moment

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.460
where you grab for the hand on the first date

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.140
and the gesture is reciprocated.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.020
Or maybe you feel it in some moment

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.220
when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:45.460
or watching somebody else do a peak athletic thing.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.700
But I think there are moments

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.180
when it feels like it's not like the way

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.140
Camus is describing things,

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:56.420
and it's better because of that.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.740
So I think one really powerful way

01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.140
for me to understand aliveness

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:05.860
is to think about, to go into a darker territory,

01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:07.260
is to think about suicide.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.900
And I've known people in my life

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.220
who suffer from clinical depression.

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:12.500
Yeah.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.540
And, you know, whatever the chemistry is in our brain,

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:22.900
there is a certain kind of feeling that is to be depressed

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.300
where you look in the mirror and ask,

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.060
do I want to kill myself today?

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.780
This is the question that Camus asks,

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:36.380
this question, this philosophical question.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:41.420
And there is people who, when they're depressed,

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:45.980
say, not only do they say, I want to kill myself or I don't,

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.500
they say, it doesn't matter.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:52.380
And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is,

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.580
that's chemistry in our mind.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.380
And then on the flip side of that, for me,

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.420
I've had some low points, but I've been very fortunate

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.940
to not suffer from that kind of depression.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.460
I am the opposite,

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:10.340
which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.940
or great music or any of that,

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:18.340
I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.500
Like, as you were saying it,

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.220
I was drinking this thing and it's cold.

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:26.140
And for some reason, the coldness of that was like,

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.980
oh, great, like refrigeration.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.900
I don't know, there was a joy in that.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.780
Like, I can't put it into words, but I just felt great.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.020
And then just so many things, you look out in nature,

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:40.060
there's a nice breeze and just like, it's amazing.

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:45.060
So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:50.260
That seems like I'm getting some nice dopamine hits

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.900
in whatever the chemistry is from just the basics of life.

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:55.940
And that is the source of aliveness.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.940
However my brain is built,

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:02.940
it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.380
And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:14.140
is to look at the chemical, the clinical depression.

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.140
And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.260
in asking the question of suicide.

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.260
Because when you look in the mirror and ask,

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.140
like if I ask myself, do I wanna kill myself today?

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.060
I ask that question in a different way,

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.140
more like a stoic way often.

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:33.140
Like basically every day is, what if I die today?

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.500
It's more like contemplating your mortality

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.380
every single day.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.780
That excites me.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.340
The possibility that this is my last day.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.140
It just reminds me how amazing life is.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.560
And that's chemistry, I don't know what that is,

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.300
but that's certainly not

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.180
some kind of philosophical decision I made.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:00.740
I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.260
of the genetics I've been given of the dopamine.

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:06.380
So that question of suicide,

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.020
by the way, do you find that formulation

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.560
of the question of existentialism?

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:16.060
I know you didn't wanna teach it

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.740
because obviously suicide is a very difficult word,

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:20.520
especially for young minds.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.520
But do you think that's a useful formulation

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.320
of the question of existentialism?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.480
Like him saying, this is the most important question

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.400
of suicide.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.400
I think there is something to it.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.680
If you read the question as the question,

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:39.000
what is it in virtue of which it ought to be desirable

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.760
to live the lives that we're capable of living?

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.440
That's a deep question.

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.640
Yeah, that's a question that gets focused

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.480
when someone asks themselves

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.120
whether they ought to continue to live that life.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.080
The famous line,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.840
nothing focuses the mind more

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.540
than one's impending execution.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:04.400
I mean, I think there's something important about that,

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.000
that recognizing the riskiness and the vulnerability

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.700
of one's existence is super important.

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:16.160
And I think that if we didn't have that,

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.720
our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.360
If they weren't risky and vulnerable,

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.180
there would be nothing to lose.

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.960
And it's only because there are things to lose

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.000
that they can come to have the significance that they do.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.480
So yeah, I think I'm not against the idea

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.320
that that's a deep way of approaching the questions

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.040
at the core of existentialism.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.200
But as you said, I was worried for a while

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.160
about how I was gonna teach it.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.400
Well, I think there's a difference

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.280
between suicide and not living,

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.480
because suicide is an action.

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.680
So it feels like to me,

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:57.020
like suicide doesn't make sense because,

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.560
imagine you're in like a hotel

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.440
and you're saying the room I'm in sucks,

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:04.760
but like there's other rooms.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.920
So like maybe explore those other rooms.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.160
Maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.040
Like basically embracing the fact

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.040
that you don't know everything

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.280
and you need time to explore everything.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.240
It's like, once you've explored everything,

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.480
then maybe you can make a full decision,

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.480
but it's unfair to make a decision.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:33.840
It's, I would say unethical to make a decision

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.520
until you've explored all the rooms in the hotel.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.360
Yeah.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.440
And this gets focused in the Brothers Karamazov, of course.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.320
There's one brother who is really asking that question.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.160
He's asking the question of suicide.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.160
He's asking the question whether the world that we live in

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:54.400
is a world that's worth living in.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.440
And I think that character's, as you say, very ill.

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.920
I mean, and it's possible,

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.200
and often because, as you say,

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.360
of brain chemistry, physiologies,

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.000
there's certainly a physical ground

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.200
to that situation, to that condition.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.680
But I think it is possible

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.440
for someone to be in that situation.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.480
I think that Ivan Karamazov,

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:26.840
who's the character who's asking this question,

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:30.120
is maybe let's say chemically depressed

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:31.360
or something like that.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.480
But I think there's more to it too.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.840
And I think that Dostoevsky's real view

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.160
is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on its own.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.960
Like the way we interact with one another,

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:46.800
the way we care about or isolate ourselves from others,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.800
the way we care for the lives that we lead

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:54.960
affects the chemistry of our brain,

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.640
which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.400
So I think Dostoevsky does think that

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.720
Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved,

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:09.960
is gonna come through the love of his brother Alyosha.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.840
Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.160
Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160
is Hermann Hesse.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.560
Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.680
that represent existentialism?

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.440
I haven't, maybe I should.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.280
What should I read?

01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:28.960
What should I think about including?

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.960
Oh no, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.880
Like there's a existentialist kind of ideal

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.520
pervading most of his work.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.160
But there's more of a, like with Siddhartha,

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.440
there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of like

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:53.760
watch the river and like become the river.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.640
Like this kind of idea that what it means

01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.760
to truly experience the moment.

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:02.800
So there is an experiential part of existentialism

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.480
where you want to, it's not just about,

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.000
we've been talking about kind of decisions and actions,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.200
but also what it means to listen,

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:11.400
like you said, from Nietzsche.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.800
Like what it means to really take in the world

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.440
and experience the moment.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.280
So he's very good at writing about

01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.960
what it means to experience the moment

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.160
and experience the full absurdity of the moment.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.240
And for him, I'm starting to forget,

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.240
Steppenwolf I think is humor is part of the absurdity,

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.800
which I think modern day internet explores very well

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.440
with memes and so on.

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.440
Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.520
that's able to deal with absurdity.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.160
You gotta like laugh at it.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.440
I think there is some,

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.800
let me just say something about humor

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.560
because I think you're absolutely right.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.680
Kierkegaard, who is Danish and most people think

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:59.120
deeply depressed and then so on,

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.960
is actually an incredibly funny writer

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.080
and someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.040
who left philosophy to become a Hollywood comedy writer.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.040
He's a very successful guy.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.760
And then he came back 25 years later

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.760
and finished his dissertation.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.440
And I was the reader on the dissertation.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:21.520
There may be a conflict of interest, I'm not quite sure.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.040
But his dissertation was about,

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.200
he called it Kierkegaard and the funny,

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.960
which is a kind of a funny title, yeah.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:32.680
But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading,

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.120
Kierkegaard does have this idea

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.440
that there's something destabilizing about humor

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.440
that's crucial to the sort of

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.880
the important possibilities for us.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.680
And so there's the idea that like,

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.280
there's a moment when a joke is being set up,

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:59.000
when you're sort of proceeding as if you're on stable ground.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.560
And then the punchline comes

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.960
and the rug is pulled out from under you.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:06.840
And for a moment, it's like you're falling.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.800
There's nothing supporting you

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.320
until you're captured by your totally new understanding

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.720
of what was going on and that humor necessarily

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:23.560
has that kind of destabilizing feature to it.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.520
And that's like the riskiness.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.680
That's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.120
If there aren't risks in your life,

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.440
if your life is totally safe,

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.200
then there's no possibility of significance.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.360
And so I think on Eric's reading,

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:40.560
Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.320
the importance of the riskiness and vulnerability

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.560
in your life to its having meaning.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:48.920
With the experience of destabilization

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.440
that you get in jokes and comedy,

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.760
which then becomes significant, right?

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.280
When you remember having heard a joke for the first time,

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.480
it's got a kind of salience for you.

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:03.400
Speaking of jokes and speaking of,

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:05.920
you mentioned film and literature.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.000
So existentialism in film and literature.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.080
I think for a lot of people,

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.560
especially nihilism was experienced

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.480
in the great work of art,

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.560
modern work of art called Big Lebowski.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.440
I don't know if you've ever seen that film,

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:26.080
but there's a group of nihilists in that film.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.040
They're just like, they don't care about anything.

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:29.320
I think they happen to be German,

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.320
at least they have German accents.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.120
So maybe can you talk about notable appearances

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.520
of existentialism in film?

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.880
And if you at all ever bring up Big Lebowski,

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
if that ever comes into play.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.400
So I know that people think about

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.720
the Big Lebowski in this context.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.760
And I did actually re-watch it not so long ago.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:54.760
We have kids and I thought, maybe it's time.

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.200
Wasn't really time for the 11 year old.

01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.600
So it's somewhat inappropriate.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.720
But I have never taught that film.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.840
So I'd have to think more.

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.720
We could talk about it.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:06.400
I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.640
Okay, so I would love to,

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.360
because there is a,

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:12.400
feels like there's a philosophical depth to that film.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:17.400
So there's a person that just, the main character.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:18.920
The Jeff Bridges character.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.320
Jeff Bridges character, yeah.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.080
He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.080
and he just kind of walks around in a very relaxed way

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:33.080
and irradiates both a love for life

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.920
but also just an acceptance of like,

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:41.040
it is what it is kind of philosophy.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.040
And then there's a bunch of characters

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.040
that have very busy lives trying to do some big projects

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.360
that are dramatic in some way,

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.320
make some huge amounts of money.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.400
So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.600
by Dostoevsky in a certain kind of sense.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.960
And then there's these players.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.480
I mean, they're phrased as nihilists

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.080
but they kind of don't care to enjoy life.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.520
They want to mess with life in some kind of way.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:13.000
And of course there's interesting personalities

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.200
that, what is it?

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.400
Jesus, the bowler.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.200
And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.680
And then there's the always, John Goodman character

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.440
that's talking about Vietnam

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.600
and just takes life way too seriously,

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.080
too intensely and so on.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.960
So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:38.240
that are operating in this world.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.720
And perhaps most importantly for existentialism

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.480
are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.760
Okay, all right, good.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.600
Well, that's helpful.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.560
Thank you for reminding me of all that.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:53.720
And I think, so one thing to say is that the nihilists,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.240
the group of nihilists who call themselves nihilists,

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.640
I think they've got a bad misinterpretation

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.400
of what nihilism is supposed to be.

01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:07.440
And this happened actually in the 20s.

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:12.160
There was a famous case of a couple of German students,

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.240
Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot of Nietzsche.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:21.240
Nietzsche was a kind of hero for the Nazis even,

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.000
I think based on a pretty bad misunderstanding

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.240
of what he was up to.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.080
But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.600
and they were students, they'd read a lot of Nietzsche

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.120
and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.160
The only way that there's any significance in life

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:42.360
is through our will to sort of powerfully

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.040
bring something about.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.400
And if we're gonna do that in a way

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:50.880
that reflects the fact that nothing means anything,

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.600
then what we should do is take these things,

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.200
these actions that people always thought were bad

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.120
and do them and show that there's nothing wrong

01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.400
with doing them.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.640
And so they decided they would murder someone,

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.440
not because they were angry at them,

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.840
just someone they'd never met.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.920
It was important that it was someone they'd never met.

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.200
It was totally unmotivated act.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.600
And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.880
by showing that we can act in such a way

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.720
as to do something that morality thinks is bad

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.800
and through our will bring it about that we desire to do it

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.240
for no reason that has anything to do

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.280
with it's potentially being interpretable as good.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:37.320
And I think that's a terrible misreading

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.920
of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism is.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.240
I mean, I think read that against the Miles Davis thing.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.160
Miles Davis aim is to creatively bring it about

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.240
that something works well in a situation

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:53.000
where he is kind of constrained.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.240
So they thought two things.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.080
One, there are no constraints at all,

01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:59.400
not even the constraints of the situation

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.000
that we find ourselves in.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.920
And two, we only become the beings that we really are

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.880
when we act against what you might have thought

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.360
the constraints were.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.520
And I just think that's a bad misreading

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.080
of what that kind of nihilism is up to.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.320
And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:20.400
has got that kind of bad misreading.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.360
But then the major characters are much more interesting.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.560
Go ahead, you were gonna say something.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.880
So there's some kind of apathy

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.920
to their particular nihilism.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:33.920
Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:37.080
as a philosophy part of that nihilism?

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.600
Sort of like from an existentialist perspective,

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.400
how important is it to care about stuff,

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.040
like really take on life?

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.320
What does existentialism have to say

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:56.320
about just sitting back and just not caring?

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:57.440
Excellent.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.800
So apathy is like a really important word.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.160
The Greek word is apatheia, it means without passions.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.240
And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.480
really thought that passions are what get in the way

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:14.120
of your living well.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.760
Because to live well, you have to think clearly

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.840
about what you should do.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.120
And you shouldn't let your resentments and your angers

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:24.600
and your petty animosities direct your behavior.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.520
You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.800
So Stoicism, again, huge caricature,

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.800
but it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.120
And there's certain forms of existentialism,

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.200
certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.200
and Dostoevsky and Heidegger and Sartre in his own way.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.120
So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:57.120
where what's crucial about us is that we do care.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.600
Heidegger says, care is the being of Dasein.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.320
Dasein is his name for us.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.760
What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.040
And you can't not do that.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.720
You can pretend you're not doing it,

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.320
but you're just caring in a different way.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.520
It's like Sartre saying,

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.240
you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.520
You can pretend that you don't have to make a decision.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.400
That is making a decision.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.440
Not caring is a way of caring.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:29.240
And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.360
think that we do care.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.840
That's constitutive of what it is to be us.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:37.760
And so they'll think that the Stoics got it wrong,

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.240
but that leaves open a huge range of moves

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:47.240
about how we inhabit that existence well.

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:50.240
Let me ask about Ayn Rand.

01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:51.080
Okay.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.520
So it just so happens that I've gotten,

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:58.200
she's entered a few conversations in this podcast

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.400
and just looking at academic philosophy

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.600
or just philosophers in general,

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.680
they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.520
Do you have a sense of why that is?

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:12.520
Does she ever come into play her ideas of objectivism,

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:14.880
come into play of discussions of,

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:19.880
a good life from the perspective of existentialism

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.400
in how you teach it and how you think about it?

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.680
Is she somebody who you find at all interesting?

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.920
So no, I don't think she is.

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.120
But it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.360
I read it in high school.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.240
I read the Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged,

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:39.320
but that's at this point a very long time ago.

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:42.440
I think I read something about objective epistemicity

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.720
or something too.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.080
So my view about her could be based on

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:50.560
a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.600
But sort of my caricature of her

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.840
and tell me if I've got it wrong

01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.840
is that she's sort of motivated by a kind of,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.280
I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism,

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.080
but maybe let's in the context of art history,

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.880
maybe let's in the context of our discussion,

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:17.400
tie it back to Sartre, a kind of view according to which

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.040
we're the being who has to contend with the fact

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:22.040
that we're radically free to do stuff

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.240
and we're just not being courageous or brave enough

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.960
when we don't do that.

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.640
And the people to admire are the people

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.960
who make stuff out of nothing.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.760
So maybe that's a bad caricature.

01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:38.160
No, no, no, I think that's pretty accurate.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.000
I'm not, again, very knowledgeable

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.280
about the full depth of her philosophy,

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.200
but I think she takes a view of the world

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.840
that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions,

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.320
but makes stronger statements about epistemology

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.200
that first of all, everything is knowable

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:03.040
and there's some, you should always operate through reason.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.480
Like reason is very important.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.480
It's like you start with a few axioms

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.040
and you build on top of that

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:15.520
and the axioms that everybody should operate on

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.040
are the same.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:21.520
Again, reality is objective, it's not subjective.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.840
So from that, you can derive the entirety

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.280
of how humans should behave at the individual level

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.080
and at the societal level.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.280
And there's a few conclusions.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:34.800
She would talk about virtue of selfishness

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.040
and sort of a lot of people use that to dismiss her.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.880
Look, she's very selfish and so on.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.280
She actually meant something very different.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.880
It's more like a Sartre thing.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:46.520
Take responsibility for yourself,

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:51.200
understand what forces you're operating under

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.880
and make the best of this life

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.760
and that's how you can be the best member of societies

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.840
by making the best life you can.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.240
And just focus on yourself,

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.880
fix your own problems first

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:06.000
and that that will make you the best member of society,

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.720
of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.720
I think the reason she's disliked,

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.200
obviously on the philosophy side,

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.120
she's disliked because a little bit like Nietzsche,

01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.160
she's literary.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:25.440
I think the reason she's publicly disliked

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.160
in sort of public conversations

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.960
is because of how sure she is of herself.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.280
Which is some of the philosophy I've been known to do,

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.600
make very strong statements like hell is other people,

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.560
but she was making very strong statements

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.360
about basically everything.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:45.880
But the reason I bring her up is

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.960
she is an influential thinker

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:54.640
that is not for some reason often brought up as such.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.240
It's not acknowledged how influential she is.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.080
I was recently looking at like a list of

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:05.240
the most important women of the 20th century

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:09.920
in terms of thought, not science, but like thought.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.680
And she wasn't in that list.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.720
And I just, I see this time and time again,

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.200
and it doesn't make sense to me

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:19.560
why she's so kind of dismissed

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.840
because clearly she's an author

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.440
of some of the most read books like ever.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:29.760
And she clearly had very strong ideas

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.360
that she'd be contented with.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.360
And that's why it kind of didn't make sense to me

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:39.680
because she's also a creature of her time

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:41.200
and an important one.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:43.240
She's a creation of the Soviet Union,

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.280
somebody who left because of that.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.960
And so some of the strength of her ideas

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.640
has to do with how much she dislikes

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.280
that particular philosophy and way of life.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.160
But also she's a creature of like Sartre

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.200
and like that's whole like Nietzsche and so on.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.520
Now, one of the other criticisms is

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.880
she doesn't integrate herself into this history.

01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:10.120
She keeps basically kind of implying

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:14.600
that she's purely original in all her thoughts,

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.000
even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.560
But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:24.680
as if they are truly original and they're not.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.520
It is interesting.

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:28.480
And also what's interesting about her is she is a woman.

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.440
She is a strong feminist.

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.040
And it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir,

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.240
it seems like she's a very important person

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:43.080
in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.

01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.480
Interesting, yeah.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.680
Well, so I mean, I don't have a lot to add.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:50.160
I will just say this.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.320
I mean, the way she and Beauvoir seemed to me

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.640
from your description of her

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.360
and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago,

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.880
they seem pretty opposite from one another.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:04.600
Like one of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:09.600
is that she takes seriously the thing that Sartre didn't,

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.920
which is our thrownness,

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.920
which is the sense in which we're born into a situation

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.120
that's already got a significance.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:22.680
For her, I think it was easier for her

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.040
to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.520
And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.360
or at least there shouldn't be.

01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:36.000
We're pretty close as privileged white males.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:36.840
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.800
If we could just get rid of the last bits of them,

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.760
we would be God like we're supposed to be.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.920
And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.160
I think she recognized one's not born

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:49.880
but becomes a woman, she says.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.440
So how does that happen?

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:53.160
Well, you're thrown into your culture

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.880
and your culture starts treating you in a certain way

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:57.080
because of your gender.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:59.560
And that starts to form your understanding

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.000
and your experience of things.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.480
And by the time you're grown up,

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.440
well, you're pretty well formed by that.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.720
That seems a fact.

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.320
It's a fact about Sartre too though

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.960
it was harder for him to notice it

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.480
because he was formed into his privilege.

01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:20.400
But the world reminds us of our thrownness

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.920
for some more than others.

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.200
Yes, absolutely.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.920
And for people who have to contend on a daily basis

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.920
with the fact that the social position they're thrown into

01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:38.040
is one that negates them or one that oppresses them

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.800
or one that sort of pushes them to the side

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.560
in some way or another.

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:46.200
The black experience is interesting in this respect too.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:48.800
Frantz Fanon, who's a contemporary of Sartre

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.200
and Beauvoir writes about it.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.560
And it's very familiar the things that he's saying now

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.560
but he writes back in the 50s

01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:58.640
about being a black man in Paris

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.800
and getting on an elevator with a woman alone.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:07.800
And how her reaction to him, not knowing him,

01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:10.200
not having any views about,

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.800
any reason to have any views about him

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.320
sort of puts him in a particular social position

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.880
with respect to her.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.360
And if you don't have that experience

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.480
it's much harder to recognize the way in which

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.760
what we're thrown into is something

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.160
we might not have chosen.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:34.280
So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:39.000
which as you describe Ayn Rand's views,

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.160
she sounds more like Sartre.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.240
She sounds more like either it's not an aspect

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.720
of our existence or at least we ought to sort of aim

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.560
at it's not being an aspect of ours.

01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.480
Yeah, almost act as if it's not.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.320
Yeah, exactly.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.160
Act as if it's not.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.360
And so I think from my point of view,

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.160
I don't pretend that I'm explaining

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.400
the public perception of her.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.720
I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.720
in this intellectual context.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.520
From my point of view, that's something big to miss

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.640
and the ambition to think that really what's happening

01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:11.720
is that we're all the same.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.720
We're all rational beings.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.880
We're all beings who if we just got the axioms

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.280
of our existence right and made good judgments

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.040
and reasoned in an appropriate way

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.360
would optimize ourselves.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:30.360
That feels to me like a kind of natural end point

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.640
of the philosophical tradition.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.800
I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.360
that helps us in that direction

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:40.960
and the enlightenment moves us further in that direction.

01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.560
But from my point of view,

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.920
that movement has led us astray

01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:48.840
because it's missed something really important

01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.760
that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.640
Yeah, it misses the music.

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.880
Exactly, it misses the music.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.320
Let's talk about thrownness

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.200
and I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:03.040
Yeah.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.120
So can we talk about Heidegger?

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:05.960
Okay.

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.840
Who is this philosopher?

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:12.160
What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.840
Okay, so Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.

01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.560
He, I do know when he was born, 1889.

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:20.440
But I know that only by accident.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:22.520
It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.360
an Austrian philosopher was born

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:26.120
and the same year that Hitler was born.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.280
So if I've remembered my dates right

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:31.520
and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:35.080
But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:36.920
And it's interesting that the three of them

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.400
were born at the same time.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.960
Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.720
but then it's also interesting that Heidegger was a Nazi.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.480
I mean, this is a very disturbing fact

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.880
about his personal political background.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.280
And so it's something that anyone who thinks

01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.960
that things that he said might be interesting

01:30:57.960 --> 01:30:59.520
has got to contend with.

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.160
Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria,

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.800
Wittgenstein is Austria also.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:09.640
But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:12.800
you have to remember, I mean, there was millions

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:14.040
of Nazis too.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.120
So like there are parts of their,

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:18.320
that's the history of the world.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:23.400
There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis

01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.440
in that part of history.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.360
Absolutely.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.360
And one of the discussion points is,

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.960
well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.160
I mean, he went to parties with them and stuff

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.080
or was he like, did he really believe in the ideology?

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:42.000
And that's a choice point.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.920
And we could talk about it if you want.

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.720
He held a political position.

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.480
That's one of the relevant parts.

01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:52.720
In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.360
That's like the president of the university.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.360
And that was in Germany, all the universities

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.960
are state universities.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:03.280
And so that's a political appointment.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:04.840
Can we just pause on this point?

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.120
From an existentialist perspective,

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:11.920
what's the role for standing up to evil?

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.800
So, I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.760
about these things,

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.600
cause he was a bit of a political figure.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:23.720
Like, do you have a responsibility,

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.120
not just for your decisions,

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.320
but if the world you see around you

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.280
is going against what you believe

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:38.680
somewhere deep inside is ethical,

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.760
do you have a responsibility to stand up to that,

01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:44.520
even if it costs you your life or your wellbeing?

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.960
Well, you asked from an existential perspective

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.080
and there's lots of different positions that you could have.

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:52.000
So let me tell you something in the area

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.280
of what I think I might believe,

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.360
which comes out of this tradition.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:59.440
And it's this,

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:01.720
if you live in a community

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.560
where people are being dragged down

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.240
by the norms of the community rather than elevated,

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:13.760
then there's two things that you have to recognize.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:17.360
One is that you bear some responsibility for that,

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.920
not necessarily because you chose it,

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:23.000
maybe you reviled it, maybe you were against it,

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.640
but there's some way in which we all act

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.640
in accordance with the norms of our culture.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.880
We all give into them in some way or another.

01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.800
And if those norms are broken,

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.400
then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.920
to be responsible for broken norms.

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.000
We've become responsible for broken norms.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.480
And I do think you have to face up to that.

01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.760
I think that, let's just take gender norms.

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:51.080
Maybe the gender norms are broken.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.800
Maybe the way men and women treat one another

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.400
or the way men treat women is broken.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.800
Maybe it is, maybe there's,

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.200
I'm not making a substantive claim,

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.640
I'm just saying, lots of people say it is.

01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:08.640
And if you were in a culture where those norms take root,

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.080
you don't get to just isolate yourself

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.680
and pull yourself out of the culture

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.840
and think I don't have any responsibility.

01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:21.280
You're already a part of the culture,

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.520
even if you're isolating yourself from it.

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:29.000
That's a way of rejecting the sort of part you play

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.840
in the culture, but it's not a way of getting behind it.

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:35.080
Now you're playing that role differently.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:39.000
You're saying, I don't wanna take responsibility

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.120
for what's going on around me.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.200
And that's a way of taking responsibility

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.720
by refusing to do it.

01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.600
So I think we're implicated

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.440
in whatever's going on around us.

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.400
And if we're gonna do anything in our lives,

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.400
we ought to recognize that,

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.040
recognize that even in situations

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.240
where you maybe didn't decide to do it,

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:05.480
you could be part of bringing other people down.

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.440
And then devote yourself to try to figure out

01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:12.000
how to act differently so that the norms update themselves.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.880
And I think this is not a criticism of people.

01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:18.920
The Alyosha who we mentioned in the Brothers Karamazov,

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.760
he's a character, he's a kind of saintly character

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.560
in the Brothers Karamazov.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:29.560
But that one crucial moment in that story

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:34.040
when he realizes how awful he's been being to someone

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.920
without ever even intending to do that.

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.560
It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:43.000
And she's a very erotic woman.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
She's sort of sexual and Alyosha in my reading of it

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.600
is kind of attracted to her.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:55.080
But he's a young kid, he's 20 or whatever.

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.680
And he's kind of embarrassed about it.

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:58.160
And he lives in the monastery

01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.160
and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest

01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.560
and he's kind of embarrassed by it.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.760
So what does he do?

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.840
Every time they run across one another in the street,

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.320
he averts his gaze.

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.200
And why is he doing that?

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:12.600
Because he's kind of embarrassed.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.360
But how does Grushenka experience it?

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.320
Well, she knows she's a fallen woman.

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.120
And she knows that Alyosha has this other position

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.440
in society.

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.240
So her read on it is he's passing judgment on me.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.560
He can see that he doesn't wanna be associated with me.

01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.440
He can see that I'm a fallen woman.

01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:32.120
He knows that in order to maintain his purity,

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.880
he's gotta avoid me.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.560
That's not what Alyosha intended to do,

01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:39.560
but that's the way it's experienced.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.880
And so there's this way he comes to recognize,

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.120
oh my God, what I'm supposed to do is love people

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.360
in Dostoevsky's view of things.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.600
And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.

01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.120
I'm making her life worse.

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:55.160
I'm making her feel terrible about herself.

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.000
And if I actually came to know her,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.720
I'd recognize her condition is difficult.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:01.480
She's living a difficult life.

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:03.120
She's making hard choices.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.640
And why don't I see that in her face

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:07.960
instead of this other thing

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.880
that's making me wanna avoid her?

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:11.440
And that's a huge moment.

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:13.240
But the idea is that we're implicated

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.440
in bringing other people down,

01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.400
whether we wanna be or not.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.600
And that's our condition.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.840
The requirement to understand that

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.240
is to be almost to a radical degree,

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:29.480
be empathetic and to listen to the world.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:33.720
And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.440
It's not so simple.

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.880
All of this is messy.

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.520
For example, this is me talking.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:42.000
It's clear to me that, for example,

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.600
the woke culture has bullying built into it,

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:50.920
has some elements of the same kind of evil built into it.

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:53.880
And when you're part of the wave of wokeness

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.200
standing up for social rights,

01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.760
you also have to listen and think, are we going too far?

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.320
Are we hurting people?

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:06.720
Are we doing the same things that others,

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.160
that we're fighting against,

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.080
that others were doing in the past?

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.000
So it's not simple once you see

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:18.960
that there's evil being done that is easy to fix.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.720
No, in our society,

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.880
there's something about our human nature

01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:31.240
that just too easily stops listening to the world,

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:33.720
to empathizing with the world.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.520
And we label things as evil.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:37.120
This is through human history.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.200
This is evil.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.920
You mentioned tribes.

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.920
This religious belief is evil.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.000
And so we have to fight it.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.280
And we become certain and dogmatic about it.

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:48.880
And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.640
It seems like a life that accepts

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.680
and a responsibility for the norms we're in

01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:00.720
has to constantly be sort of questioning yourself

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.760
and questioning, like listening to the world fully

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:09.240
and richly without being weighed down

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:13.520
by any one sort of realization.

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.600
You just always constantly have to be thinking

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.440
about the world.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.280
Am I wrong?

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:18.800
Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?

01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.600
I mean, the very last thing you said,

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.680
you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.240
You've constantly got to be listening.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.800
You've constantly got to be attending.

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.640
And it's not simple.

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.240
All that sounds exactly right to me.

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:32.760
And the phrase that rings through my head

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.880
is another one from the Brothers Karamazov,

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.480
Demetri, this passionate sort of sometimes violent brother

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:44.480
who is also sort of deeply cares.

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.840
I mean, because he's passionate,

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:49.320
he's sort of got care through and through,

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:51.080
but it's breaking him apart.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.080
He says at one point,

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:57.360
God and the devil are fighting in the battlefield

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.640
is the heart of man.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:02.560
And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:05.560
And the idea that there might be a purely good way

01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:08.280
of doing things, it's just not our condition

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:11.520
that everything we do is gonna be sort of undermined

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.920
by some aspect of it.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.920
There's not gonna be a kind of pure good in human existence.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.400
And so it's sort of required

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.000
that we're gonna have to be empathetic,

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.960
that we're gonna have to recognize

01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:31.200
that others are dealing with that just as we are.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:33.840
So I apologize for distracting us.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.720
We were talking about Heidegger.

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:38.920
That, and the reason we were distracted

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.520
is he happened to also be a Nazi,

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:45.000
but he nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.320
What are the ideas he's brought to the world?

01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:49.720
Okay, so that's a big, huge question.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.160
So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:58.000
I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks,

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.160
and he's not really wrong to think this,

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.200
that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward,

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.480
maybe even from the pre-Socratics forward,

01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:13.400
from like the sixth century BC to now,

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:16.440
has been motivated by a certain kind,

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:19.640
or has been grounded on a certain kind of assumption

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:22.040
that it didn't have the right to make,

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:24.640
and that it's led us astray,

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.360
and that until we understand the way

01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:29.880
in which it's led us astray,

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.640
we're not gonna be able to get to grips

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.280
with the condition we now find ourselves in.

01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.000
So let me start with what he thinks

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.880
the condition we now find ourselves in is.

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.800
Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.120
I'm just gonna sort of mush it all together

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.120
for the purposes of today.

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.360
Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.400
that we need to contend with

01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:56.200
when we think about what it is to be us now

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.880
is that the right name for our age is a technological age.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:02.440
And what does it mean for our age

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:04.720
to be a technological age?

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.280
Well, it means that we have an understanding

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.640
of what it is for anything at all to be, at all,

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.680
that we never really chose,

01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:19.440
that sort of animating the way we live our lives,

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.760
that's animating our understanding of ourselves

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:26.280
and everything else, that is quite limited.

01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.760
And it's organized around the idea

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.760
that to be something is to be what's sitting there

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.160
as an infinitely flexible reserve

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:43.720
to be optimized and made efficient.

01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:50.080
And Heidegger thinks that that's not just the way

01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:56.040
we think of silicon circuits or the river

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.560
when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it,

01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:02.760
we're optimizing the flow of the river

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.240
so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible

01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:07.560
and we can use in any way at all.

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:11.120
It's the way we understand ourselves too.

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:16.120
We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.320
that needs to be made efficient and optimized.

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.560
And when I talk with my students about it,

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:26.760
I ask them, what's your calendar look like?

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.920
What's the goal of your day?

01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:32.880
Is it to get as many things into it as possible?

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.320
Is it to feel like I've failed

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.040
unless I've made my life so efficient

01:43:40.040 --> 01:43:43.480
that I'm doing this and this and this and this and this

01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:45.680
that I can't let things go by?

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:49.480
The feeling that I think we all have

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.080
that there's some pressure to do that,

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.120
to relate to ourselves that way

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.560
is a clue to what Heidegger thinks

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.080
the technological age is about.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.720
And he thinks that's different

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.920
from every other age in history.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.640
We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century

01:44:07.640 --> 01:44:10.040
at the beginning of the enlightenment

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:14.440
as subjects who represent objects.

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:17.600
Descartes thought that a subject is something,

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:20.600
some mental sort of realm

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.320
that represents the world in a certain way.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.040
And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.720
that we have a special relation to our representations.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.840
And that's what the realm of the subject is.

01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.760
But others, in the middle ages,

01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.920
we were created in the image and likeness of God.

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:39.240
And in the pre-Socratic age,

01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:43.760
to be was to be what whooshes up and lingers for a while

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.760
and fades away the paradigm of what is we're thunderstorms

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:53.600
and the anger of the gods, Achilles battle fury.

01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.160
And it overtakes everything and stays for a while

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.880
and then leaves the flowers blooming in spring.

01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.360
And that's very different

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.600
from the way we experience ourselves.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.160
And so the question is,

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.640
what are we supposed to do in the face of that?

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.720
And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.160
that's motivated everything

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.960
from the pre-Socratics forward

01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.960
is that there is some entity

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.440
that's the ground of the way we understand everything to be.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.360
For the middle ages, it was God.

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:33.200
That was the entity that made things

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:35.240
be the things that they are.

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:40.240
For the enlightenment, it was us, maybe first art, it's us.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.880
And Heidegger thinks whatever it is

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.120
that stands at the ground of what we are,

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.400
it's not another thing, it's not another entity.

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.720
And we're relating to it in the wrong way

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:53.720
if we think of it like that.

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:55.600
There's some way, and this is partly why

01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.880
I was interested in Meister Eckhart.

01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:01.640
He says, what there is is there's giving going on

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.640
in the world and we're the grateful recipient of it.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.160
And the giving is like, whatever it is,

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.600
it's the social norms that we're thrown into.

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.720
We didn't choose them, they were given to us.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:15.960
And that's the ground.

01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.640
That is what makes it possible

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.800
for anything to be intelligible at all.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:21.840
If we lived outside of communities,

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:24.760
if we lived in a world where there were no social norms

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:27.600
at all, nothing would mean anything.

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.320
Nothing would have any significance.

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.480
Nothing would be regular in the way

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.240
that things need to be regular

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:36.320
in order for there to be departures or manifestations

01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.920
of that regularity.

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.000
So community norms are crucial,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.600
but they're also always updating.

01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:50.600
We have some responsibility for what they are

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.800
and the way in which they're updating themselves.

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:57.160
And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:02.160
So those norms are somehow giving significance to us

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:05.760
in a way that we're implicated in.

01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.760
We have some relation to, and all that gets covered over

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:13.040
if you think of us as efficient resources to be optimized.

01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:14.880
Is that a conflicting view

01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:18.920
that we are resources to be optimized?

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:22.000
Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.880
that there's a ground that we stand on?

01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.720
Absolutely.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:27.600
So what Heidegger thinks is that this is the,

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.280
he calls this the supreme danger of the technological age

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:33.640
is that without ever having chosen it,

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:35.640
without ever having decided it,

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.040
this is the way we understand what it is to be us.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:43.000
But he thinks that it's also, he says,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.640
quoting Hulderlin, this 18th century German poet,

01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.160
he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.880
So what does that mean?

01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:56.120
It means that this is the understanding

01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.240
that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:00.400
It's the gift that was given to us.

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:01.760
It's supremely dangerous.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.320
If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.720
But it's also the saving possibility

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:13.720
because if we recognize that we never chose that,

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:17.360
that it was given to us,

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.720
but also we were implicated in its being given

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:22.800
and we could find a way to supersede it,

01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.240
that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:28.960
He calls the ground the groundless ground.

01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:34.200
It's not like an entity, which is there, solid, stable,

01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:37.960
like God, who's eternal and non-changing.

01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.560
It's always updating itself.

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.800
And we're always involved in its being updated.

01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:45.440
But we're only involved in it in the right way

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.160
if we listen, like Miles Davis.

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:54.200
So optimization is not a good way to live life.

01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:58.880
If you thought that it was obviously clear

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.920
that that was the relevant value,

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:04.120
so obviously clear that it never even occurred to you

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.960
to ask whether it was right to think that,

01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:08.680
then you would be in danger.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:09.800
Yeah. Got it.

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:13.800
So yeah, there is some in this modern technological age

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.120
in the full meaning of the word technology

01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:18.400
that's updated to actual modern age

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:22.560
with a lot more technology going on.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:28.040
It does feel like colleagues of mine in tech space, actually,

01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:30.960
are somehow drawn to that optimization

01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:33.240
as if that's going to save us,

01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.960
as if the thing that truly weighs us down

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:39.040
is the inefficiencies.

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:39.880
Exactly.

01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:43.000
And I think if you think about other contexts,

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.040
like what are the moments when,

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.480
I mean, we're unique in this respect.

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.920
This period in history is unlike any previous period.

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.920
Nobody ever felt that way, right?

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.600
But think about, but it's also true

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:58.400
that no previous period in history was nihilistic.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.040
So our condition is tied up.

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:03.240
That sort of thing is meant to be a response

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.480
to the felt lack of a ground.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:10.480
And so no previous epoch in history felt that way.

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:13.200
They didn't have our problem.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:17.200
But think, so it was much more natural to them

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:22.200
to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for us,

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.960
what we were calling moments of aliveness before.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:28.560
Think about the context in which they felt them.

01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:31.720
They weren't efficient optimized context.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.400
Think about the Greeks.

01:50:33.400 --> 01:50:37.440
If you ever read Homer, it is a bizarre world back there.

01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.880
But one of the things that's bizarre

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:44.880
is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing

01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.040
that the only thing that seems to run through

01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:53.400
all of the different Greek cultures is the idea

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.400
that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them

01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:03.560
because Zeus is the God of strangers

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:04.640
and Zeus will be angry.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:05.760
That's what they say, right?

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.200
But how does it manifest itself?

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.720
Odysseus, he's trying to get home

01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.000
and he gets shipwrecked on an island.

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:14.840
And he's trying to figure out,

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.400
he's been at sea for 10 days, he's starving,

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:21.000
he's bedraggled and he sees now Cissa,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.680
the princess who's beautiful and he's like,

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:28.280
boy, I better, I don't know, get some clothes or something.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.880
I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.520
And so she takes him to the palace.

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:37.620
They have three days of banquets and festivals

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.400
before they even ask his name.

01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:43.160
It's like, here's a stranger.

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:46.960
Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.840
because this is where significance lies.

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.640
Now we don't have to feel that way,

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:54.040
but the idea that that's one of the places

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.360
where significance could lie is pretty strongly at odds

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.040
with the idea that our salvation is gonna come

01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.760
from optimization and efficiency.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:04.680
Now maybe something about the way we live our lives

01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:06.800
will have that integrated into it,

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:12.040
but it's at odds with other moments.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.480
Let me ask you a question about Hubert Bert Dreyfus.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:21.280
He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours,

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:23.980
unfortunately no longer with us.

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:26.680
You wrote with him the book titled

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:30.480
All Things Shining, Reading the Western Classics

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.680
to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:37.920
First, can you maybe speak about who that man was,

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:39.880
what you learned from him?

01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.400
And then we can maybe ask, how do we find

01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.600
through the classics, meaning in a secular age?

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.600
Okay, so Bert Dreyfus was a very important philosopher

01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:58.240
of the late 20th, early 21st century.

01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:03.200
He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.200
He was my teacher, I met him in 1989

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.160
when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley,

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.680
that's where he taught.

01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:14.240
He plays an interesting and important role

01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:16.320
in the history of philosophy in America

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:21.320
because in a period when most philosophers in America

01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:25.820
and in the English speaking world

01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:28.400
were not taking seriously 20th century

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.800
French and German philosophy, he was,

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:34.720
and he was really probably the most important

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:37.120
English speaking interpreter of Heidegger,

01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:39.680
the German philosopher that we're talking about,

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:41.120
we've been talking about.

01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:44.560
He was an incredible teacher,

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:47.280
a lot of his influence came through his teaching.

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.280
And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher

01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:57.680
was his sort of mix of intellectual humility

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:05.000
with sort of deep, insightful authority.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.600
And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students,

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.200
he taught huge classes,

01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:13.120
because people loved to go see him

01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.980
and I taught for him for many years.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:20.280
And say, you know, I've been reading this text for 40 years

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.160
but the question you asked is one I've never asked.

01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:25.200
And it would be true.

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:29.640
Like he would find in what people said,

01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.000
things that were surprising and new to him.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.560
And that's humility actually.

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:34.480
That is.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.040
Listening to the world.

01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:38.160
Absolutely, absolutely.

01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.240
He was always ready to be surprised

01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:43.960
by something that someone said.

01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:46.640
And there's something astonishing about that.

01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:49.160
So his influence was, you know,

01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.800
for people who didn't know him

01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:52.980
through his interpretations of these texts,

01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:55.060
he wrote about a huge range of stuff.

01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.480
But for people who did know him,

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.720
it was through his presence,

01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.840
it was through the way he carried himself in his life.

01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:05.080
And so in any case, that's who he was.

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:10.080
I graduated after many years as a graduate student.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:12.560
I didn't start in philosophy, I started in math,

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.340
math and computer science, actually.

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.400
And then I did a lot of work

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.200
in computational neuroscience for a few years.

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.480
That's a fascinating journey.

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:22.880
We'll get to it through our friendly conversation

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.000
about artificial intelligence, I'm sure.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.640
Because you're basically fascinated

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:31.960
with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind,

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.240
but rooted in a curiosity of mind through the,

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:39.700
it's artificial, through the engineering of mind.

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:41.360
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.840
So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:48.440
is because of his, to begin with,

01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.800
was because of his criticisms

01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:52.440
of what was called traditional symbolic AI

01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.480
in the 70s and 80s.

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.360
So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student

01:55:57.360 --> 01:55:59.440
who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer science,

01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:01.840
a lot of computational neuroscience.

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.760
I noticed that you had,

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:07.220
you interview a lot of people in this world.

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:11.460
And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate,

01:56:11.460 --> 01:56:13.920
Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton,

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.100
a big book on neural networks.

01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.160
So I was interested in that,

01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:22.080
not so interested in traditional AI,

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.280
like sort of Lisp programings,

01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.160
things that went on in the 80s,

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:29.200
because it felt sort of,

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:31.160
when you made a system do something,

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:34.000
all of a sudden it was an interesting thing to have done.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.760
The fact that you'd solved the problem

01:56:36.760 --> 01:56:37.940
then made it clear that the problem

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:39.640
wasn't an interesting one to solve.

01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:40.640
That's right.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:42.160
And I had that experience.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:46.520
And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI,

01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.820
what he called good old fashioned AI, GoFi.

01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:52.860
And I was attracted to those criticisms

01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:56.980
because it felt to me that there was something lacking

01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.840
in that project.

01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:00.420
And I didn't know what it was.

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.020
I just felt its absence.

01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:07.620
And then I learned that all his arguments

01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:10.860
came from his reading of this phenomenological

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:12.500
and existential tradition.

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:14.140
And so I had to try to figure out

01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.160
what those folks were saying.

01:57:15.160 --> 01:57:18.020
And it was a long road, let me tell you.

01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:19.420
It took me a long time.

01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:21.540
But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:23.860
So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.

01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.140
And eventually we went on to write a book together,

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:28.180
which was a great experience.

01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.700
And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.

01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.980
And that's a book that I definitely would not have had

01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.540
the chutzpah to try to write if it weren't for Bert,

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:42.620
because it was really about great literature

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:43.780
in the history of the West,

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.660
from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.

01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.620
There's a huge chapter on Melville,

01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.540
a big chapter on David Foster Wallace,

01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:54.100
who Bert didn't care about at all,

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.100
but I was fascinated by.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:58.780
And so learning to think that way

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.660
while writing that book with him

01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:04.260
was an amazing experience.

01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:08.580
So I have to admit, one of my failings in life,

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:12.500
one of many failings is I've never gotten through Moby Dick

01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:15.220
or any of Melville's works.

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:17.420
So maybe can you comment on,

01:58:17.420 --> 01:58:20.140
before we talk about David Foster Wallace,

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.660
who I have gotten through,

01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:28.340
what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?

01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:29.300
Good.

01:58:29.300 --> 01:58:32.140
So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:33.780
of the 19th century.

01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:36.180
So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick,

01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:38.140
and they're diametrically opposed,

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:40.140
which is one of the really interesting things.

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:43.340
So the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of,

01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:46.340
it's a kind of existential interpretation

01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:48.500
of Russian Orthodox Christianity.

01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:51.980
How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?

01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:55.260
Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.340
It's about, it sort of starts with the observation

01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.740
that the form of Christianity

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:07.740
that Ishmael is familiar with is broken.

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:11.220
It's not gonna work in his living his life.

01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:12.580
He has to leave it.

01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:17.620
He has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.

01:59:18.140 --> 01:59:20.780
And Ishmael is the boating captain,

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.740
the whaling boat captain.

01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:26.020
So now he's not the captain, that's Ahab.

01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.020
Ahab is the captain.

01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.380
Yeah, right, let me back up.

01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:32.020
The famous opening line to the book is call me Ishmael.

01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:35.420
And Ishmael is the main character in the book.

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:36.780
He's a nobody.

01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:37.780
He's you and me.

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.220
He's the everyday guy.

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.140
He's like a nobody on the ship.

01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:43.580
He's like, you know, not the lowest,

01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.900
but certainly not the highest.

01:59:44.900 --> 01:59:46.540
He's right in the middle.

01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:50.020
And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:53.460
because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of Abraham

01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.340
in the Old Testament.

01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.860
He is the, I think if I have it right,

01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:01.220
again, someone will correct me.

02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:06.220
I think he's the one that Islam traces its Genesis to.

02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:10.900
And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion,

02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:12.900
like Judaism and Christianity.

02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:15.700
But Judaism and Christianity trace their lineage

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:19.900
through Isaac, the quote unquote legitimate son of Abraham.

02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.900
And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham,

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:25.500
who he had with a girlfriend.

02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:30.500
And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.

02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:36.100
He's named after the non-Christian sort of son of Abraham.

02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:42.220
And the book starts out with this,

02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:44.180
what does he call it?

02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:48.060
Something like a dark and misty November mood.

02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:53.580
He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his,

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.340
I can't remember what the word is, but his hypos.

02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.700
That's what he calls them.

02:00:57.700 --> 02:00:59.180
He's in a mood.

02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.420
He's depressed.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:01.420
He's down.

02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.820
Things are not going well.

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:04.740
And that's where he starts.

02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:09.420
And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage

02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:14.420
with this captain Ahab, who is this incredibly charismatic,

02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:19.060
deeply disturbing character,

02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:22.780
who is a captain who's got lots of history

02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:25.820
and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.

02:01:25.820 --> 02:01:26.660
That's what they do.

02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:28.540
They harpoon these whales and bring them back

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:30.900
and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.

02:01:31.820 --> 02:01:35.900
So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful.

02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.660
He's an authority figure.

02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:41.420
And he is megalomaniacally obsessed

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:45.060
with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby Dick.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:48.020
And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest,

02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:51.060
the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.

02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:52.660
And Ahab wants to get him

02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:55.620
because a number of years earlier,

02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:57.540
he had an encounter with Moby Dick

02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:00.460
where Moby Dick bit off his leg.

02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:02.580
And he survived,

02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:06.580
but he had this deeply religious experience

02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:08.220
in the wake of it.

02:02:08.220 --> 02:02:11.820
And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.

02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.300
What is the meaning of my suffering?

02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:17.740
Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick,

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:20.300
this Leviathan at the center of it,

02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.540
should treat me this way?

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:25.660
And so his task is not just to go whaling,

02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:27.900
it's to figure out the meaning of the universe

02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:30.420
through going whaling

02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:33.940
and having a confrontation with his tormentor,

02:02:33.940 --> 02:02:35.980
this whale, Moby Dick.

02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:37.780
And the confrontation is so weird

02:02:37.780 --> 02:02:40.620
because Melville points out that whales,

02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:43.860
their faces are so huge.

02:02:43.860 --> 02:02:46.500
Their foreheads are so huge

02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:49.180
and their eyes are on the side of them

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:52.260
that you can never actually look them in the eye.

02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:54.740
And it's kind of a metaphor for God,

02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:57.500
like you can't ever look God in the face.

02:02:57.660 --> 02:03:00.140
That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.

02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:02.900
You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe

02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:04.540
by looking God in the face.

02:03:05.940 --> 02:03:07.340
But Ahab wants to.

02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:11.020
He says he's got a pasteboard mask of a face,

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.980
but I'll strike through the mask

02:03:12.980 --> 02:03:15.180
and find out what's behind.

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.460
And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing

02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:19.780
and he's like going whaling

02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:21.940
because he's in a bad mood.

02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:23.780
And maybe this will make things better.

02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:27.940
And he makes friends with this guy, Kwee Kweg.

02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:30.460
And Kwee Kweg is a pagan.

02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:33.100
He's from an island in the South Pacific

02:03:33.100 --> 02:03:38.100
and he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.

02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:42.300
He's a party colored, like every different color,

02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:45.340
it says Ishmael, is these tattoos.

02:03:45.340 --> 02:03:50.340
And they are the writing on his body,

02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:54.820
he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe

02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:56.540
as understood through his culture.

02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:02.220
And so somehow Kwee Kweg is this character

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:04.980
who is like not Christian at all.

02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:09.220
And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.

02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:10.620
He's supposed to be the king.

02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:11.820
He's the son of the king

02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.820
and probably his father's died by now.

02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.740
And if he went home, he'd be the king.

02:04:15.740 --> 02:04:17.380
But he's off on a voyage too,

02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.700
trying to understand who he is

02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.700
before he goes back and leads his people.

02:04:20.700 --> 02:04:24.940
And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.

02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:28.020
And he's got the mystery of the universe

02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:32.220
tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.

02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:36.060
And it's through his relation with Kwee Kweg

02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:39.340
that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding

02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:40.660
of what we might be about.

02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:43.740
So that's Moby Dick in a nutshell.

02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:49.420
And connected to a book I have read, which is funny.

02:04:49.420 --> 02:04:53.220
There's probably echoes that represent the 20th century now

02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:56.780
in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway

02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:01.780
that also has similar, I guess, themes,

02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:06.820
but more personal, more focused on the,

02:05:07.420 --> 02:05:09.220
I mean, I guess it's less about God.

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:11.620
It's almost more like the existentialist version

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:12.460
of Moby Dick.

02:05:13.420 --> 02:05:14.780
And hence shorter.

02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:15.740
A lot shorter, yeah.

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:17.980
Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.

02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.260
But do you see echoes?

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:23.740
And do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.900
It's been since ninth grade that I read

02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:29.780
Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than the fountainhead.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:31.660
So I didn't know we were gonna go there.

02:05:31.660 --> 02:05:33.300
I mean, I find Hemingway interesting,

02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:37.340
but Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him

02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:42.340
is that we have to confront the danger

02:05:42.940 --> 02:05:44.340
and the difficulties of our life.

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:47.420
We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage

02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:48.260
and manliness.

02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:50.500
And I think there's something interesting about that.

02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:53.860
He's for risk in a certain way.

02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:58.860
And I think that's important, but I don't have any right

02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:02.580
to say this since it's been so long since I read it.

02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:07.580
I do feel like I don't remember a sense

02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:11.680
for quite the tragedy of it.

02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:12.800
Maybe there is.

02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.240
Is it a melancholy novel?

02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.360
I don't even remember.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.360
No, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.920
It has a sense of this is how life is.

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:27.960
And it has more about old age

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:32.960
and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:36.440
of this is how time passes.

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.440
And then the passing of time and how you get older

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.880
and this is one last fish.

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:46.440
It's less about this is the fish.

02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:51.160
It's more like this is one last fish and asking

02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:56.160
who was I as a man, as a human being in this world?

02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:00.120
And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.

02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:01.400
Wonderful.

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.320
But it's one fish which is just sort of

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.240
all the other fish too, right?

02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:11.200
And that is a big difference because for Ahab,

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.440
no other fish will do than Moby Dick.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.280
It's gotta be the biggest, the most powerful,

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:18.080
the most tormenting.

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.400
It's gotta be the one that you've got history with

02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:25.400
that has defiled you and it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.880
What about David Foster Wallace?

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:34.480
So why is he important to you in the search of meaning

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.000
in a secular age?

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.720
Good, so just to finish the Moby Dick thing,

02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:42.360
I think what's interesting about Melville is that

02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:45.440
he thinks our salvation comes not if we get

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:48.120
in the right relation to monotheism or Christianity,

02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:51.280
but if we get in the right relation to polytheism,

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.840
to the idea that there's not a unity to our existence,

02:07:54.840 --> 02:07:56.960
but there are lots of little meanings

02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.680
and they don't cohere.

02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:03.680
Sometimes like in Homer, sometimes you're in love.

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:09.160
Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.

02:08:09.160 --> 02:08:12.200
They go off and run away and the Trojan War begins.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.840
And sometimes you're in a battle fury.

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:17.800
Love is Aphrodite's realm and the battle fury,

02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.520
that's Ares' realm and that's a totally different world.

02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:22.800
And they're not even, I mean, they're related.

02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:25.440
There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.

02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:28.960
Mostly you're just in different sort of local

02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:30.120
meaningful worlds.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:34.040
And Melville seems to think that that's a thing

02:08:34.040 --> 02:08:36.360
that we could aim to bring back.

02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:40.600
He says, we have to lure back the Mary May Day gods of old

02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.920
and lovingly enthrone them in the now egotistical sky,

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:47.800
the now unhaunted hill.

02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:49.920
That's what, we live in this world where hills

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.280
aren't haunted with significance anymore

02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.680
and the sky is just a bunch of stuff

02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:58.400
that we're studying with physics and astrophysics and stuff.

02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:03.080
But they used to be awe-inspiring and we have to figure out

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.000
how to get in that relation to them,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.640
but not by trying to give a unity to our existence

02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:10.240
through developing habits and practices

02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.240
that get written on our body.

02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:16.120
And so his is about the end of Judeo-Christianity

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.760
and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.120
In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting

02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:27.040
about him is that I think he's a great observer

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:29.400
of the contemporary world.

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.000
And he's a very funny writer, I mean, he's really funny.

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:35.520
But he's a great observer of the contemporary world

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.560
and what he thought was at the core

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:42.320
of the contemporary world was this constant temptation

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.960
to diversion through entertainment.

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.160
That's a different story than Heidegger's story

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:49.760
about efficiency and optimization,

02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:51.400
but it's the other side of it.

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.840
Like what is this temptation sort of diverting us from?

02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:57.520
The ability to be more efficient.

02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:03.360
So you're tempted to go watch some stupid film

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:06.200
or television show or something that's dumb

02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.200
and not really very interesting,

02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:11.440
but you read that temptation as a temptation precisely

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:13.040
in virtue of it's taking you away

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:15.880
from your optimizing your existence.

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:18.080
And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.

02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:20.400
I think he's brilliant at describing it.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:23.840
I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in,

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:27.760
that it was something that we needed to confront

02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.920
and find a way out of.

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:32.880
And his characters are trying to do that.

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:36.680
And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's.

02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.640
One, I mean, David Foster Wallace committed suicide.

02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.680
And when I, and it's very sad,

02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:47.000
and he clearly did have sort of,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.560
there was a physiological basis to his condition.

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:53.240
He knew it, he was treating it from decades with medication.

02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:56.680
He had electroshock therapy a number of times.

02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.080
It's just very, very sad story.

02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.640
When I decided that we were gonna write

02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:03.760
about David Foster Wallace,

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:06.400
the first thing I was worried about is what,

02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:11.400
can you, like obviously a motivating factor,

02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:14.280
maybe the motivating factor in his committing suicide

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.280
was his physiological condition.

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.000
But there was a question, could you think,

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.480
I mean, he's obsessed with the condition,

02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:28.040
with what we need to do to achieve our salvation,

02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:31.920
to live well, to make our lives worth living.

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.920
And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.240
So in addition to the physiological thing,

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:42.720
which probably most of it, the question for me was,

02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.840
could you find in his writing what his,

02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:51.560
what he was identifying as the thing we needed to be doing

02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:54.720
that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.760
And he talks as if that's the difficulty for him.

02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:01.680
So that's one side of him.

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.960
And I did wanna find that.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.120
I think there's another side of him that's very different,

02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:07.040
but you were gonna ask.

02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.920
No, please, what's the other side?

02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:13.840
I mean, what I write about in the chapter mostly

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.840
is what I think he's got as our saving possibility.

02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:20.920
He thinks our saving possibility,

02:12:20.920 --> 02:12:23.920
he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to Kenyon,

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:29.560
is that we have the freedom to interpret situations

02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.360
however we like.

02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:34.120
So what's the problem case for him?

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:38.160
He says, look, the problem case, we have it all the time.

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.600
You get pissed off at the world.

02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.280
Some big SUV cuts you off on the highway

02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:47.160
and you're pissed off.

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.800
And you might express your anger

02:12:49.800 --> 02:12:54.320
with one finger or another directed at that person.

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:59.320
And he says, but actually, you're being pissed off

02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:02.960
as the result of your having made an assumption.

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.480
And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.960
Like the assumption is that you're the center

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.680
of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.

02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:15.080
And the way to talk yourself out of it,

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.600
the way to talk yourself out of it, he says,

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:21.840
is to recognize the possibility

02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:25.040
that maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:29.600
Like maybe that guy is racing to the hospital

02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:33.720
to take care of his dying spouse

02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:36.920
who's been there suffering from cancer,

02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:41.600
or maybe he's on the way to pick up a sick child,

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:44.880
or maybe he's, and it's not an action directed.

02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:47.240
That was your assumption, not something

02:13:47.240 --> 02:13:49.240
that was inherent in the situation.

02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.240
And I think there's something interesting about that.

02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:54.960
I think there's something right about that.

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:59.960
At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if

02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:03.960
we can just spin out these stories

02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:06.880
and whether they're true or not doesn't matter.

02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:11.240
What matters is that they free us from this assumption.

02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:13.440
And I think they only free us from this assumption

02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:14.320
if they're true.

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:18.400
Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you

02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:20.040
and that's part of the situation.

02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:21.200
And like, you can't pretend

02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.200
that it's not part of the situation.

02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.440
You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:29.160
So you have to listen to what's actually happening

02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.040
and then you have to figure out how to make it right.

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.080
And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.

02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:37.640
He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation.

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.840
You can just tell whatever story you like about it.

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.840
And I think that's actually too tough.

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:46.680
I don't think we have that kind of freedom.

02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:50.400
And he writes these sort of incredibly moving letters

02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:52.480
when he's trying to write the Pale King,

02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:55.360
which is the unfinished novel

02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.440
that really sort of drove him to distraction.

02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:02.040
At the center of the novel is this character

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:04.440
who one of the characters at the center of the novel

02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.400
is a guy who's doing the most boring thing

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.120
you could possibly imagine.

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:14.200
He is an IRS tax examiner.

02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:17.560
He's going over other people's tax returns,

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:20.520
trying to figure out whether they followed the rules or not.

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:23.120
And like, just the idea of doing that

02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.880
for eight hours a day is just terrifying.

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.760
And he puts this guy in a enormous warehouse

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:33.400
that extends for miles,

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.400
where person after person after person is in rows of desks,

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:42.440
sort of nameless, each of them doing this task.

02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:45.720
So he's in nowhere doing nothing

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.960
and it's got to be intensely boring.

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.720
And now the main character is trying to teach himself

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:53.400
to do that.

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:56.400
And the question is, how do you put up with the boredom?

02:15:56.400 --> 02:16:01.000
How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.000
And the main character is able to confront that condition

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
with such bliss that he literally levitates from happiness

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.160
while he's going over other people's tax returns.

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:20.680
And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace

02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:24.200
must've imagined we have to try to aspire to.

02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:25.800
And I think that's unlivable.

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:29.480
I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:31.560
I think there's something else we could achieve.

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:34.040
And the other thing that we can achieve

02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:38.320
that I think is something that he also is onto,

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:40.760
but doesn't write about as often,

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.760
is something more like achieving peak moments

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.800
of significance in a situation when something great happens.

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.200
And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.

02:16:54.200 --> 02:16:55.720
He loved tennis.

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.600
Are you a tennis lover?

02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:58.800
I'm not a lover of tennis,

02:16:58.800 --> 02:17:01.280
but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.

02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.640
I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example,

02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:07.880
like see the beauty in it, the artistry.

02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:09.480
I just liked it as a sport.

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:10.320
Good, okay.

02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:11.840
Well, I didn't play much tennis,

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:14.520
but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:17.520
And I always started with boring to watch.

02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:20.800
But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer,

02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:23.320
you're like, wow, I've been missing something.

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.880
And the article which appeared in the New York Times magazine

02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:28.600
was called Roger Federer as religious experience.

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:30.840
Oh wow, there you go.

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:33.760
And he says, look, there's something astonishing

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:37.880
about watching someone who's got a body like us.

02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:40.440
And having a body is a limitation.

02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:45.280
It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.280
and exhaustion, and it's the thing that dies in the end.

02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.960
And so it's what we have to confront.

02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:56.840
I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.

02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:58.760
Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.

02:17:58.760 --> 02:17:59.600
If you didn't have a body,

02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:03.680
there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.

02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:08.200
But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:11.840
that when you watch someone who's got one

02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:14.880
and is extraordinary at the way they use it,

02:18:14.880 --> 02:18:17.800
you can recognize how that limitation can be

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:20.360
to some degree transcended.

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:24.040
And that that's what we can get when we watch Federer

02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:27.240
or some other great athlete sort of doing these things

02:18:27.240 --> 02:18:30.920
that transcend the limitations of their bodies.

02:18:30.920 --> 02:18:34.120
And that that's the kind of peak experience

02:18:34.120 --> 02:18:37.920
that we're capable of that could be a kind of salvation.

02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:40.040
That's a very different story.

02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:42.240
And I think that's a livable story.

02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:45.400
And I don't know if it would have saved him,

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:48.680
but I feel like I wish he developed

02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:50.760
that side of the story more.

02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:52.160
Can we talk about, and first of all,

02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:55.040
let me just comment that I deeply appreciate

02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:59.160
that you said you were gonna say something.

02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:01.520
The fact that you're listening to me is amazing,

02:19:01.520 --> 02:19:03.600
like that you care about other humans.

02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.680
I really appreciate that.

02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:07.720
We should be in this way listening to the world.

02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:11.480
So that's a meta comment

02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:13.920
about many of the things we're talking about.

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.200
But you mentioned something about levitating

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:19.560
and a task that is infinitely boring

02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:24.520
and contrasting that with essentially levitating on a task

02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:28.680
that is great, like the highest achievement

02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:33.320
of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.

02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:34.840
Now, I often say this,

02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.480
I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this,

02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:42.080
but he said that the key to life is to be unborable.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:44.520
That is the embodiment of this philosophy.

02:19:44.520 --> 02:19:47.920
And when people ask me for advice,

02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:51.720
like young students, I don't find this interesting.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:52.600
I don't find this interesting.

02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:55.520
How do I find the thing I'm passionate for?

02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:57.520
This would be very interesting to explore

02:19:57.520 --> 02:19:59.240
because you kind of say that

02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:02.880
that may not be a realizable thing to do,

02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:04.240
which is to be unborable.

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:07.360
But my advice usually is life is amazing.

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:09.960
Like you should be able to,

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.400
you should strive to discover the joy,

02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:17.200
the levitation in everything.

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:21.400
And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time,

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:23.400
that might be the thing you should stick to,

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:26.440
but everything should be full of joy.

02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:31.440
So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring

02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:34.680
is a thing that will prevent you from discovering

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:38.320
the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy.

02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:42.160
But you're saying being unborable

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:45.600
is not actionable for a human being.

02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.840
So, okay, excellent question, deep question.

02:20:48.880 --> 02:20:53.880
And you might think because of the title of the book

02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.680
that Burt and I wrote, All Things Shining,

02:20:57.680 --> 02:20:59.400
that I think all things are shining.

02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:06.280
But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal

02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:07.600
to be unborable.

02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:10.400
I do believe that you're right,

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:14.440
that a lot of times when people are bored with something,

02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:16.520
it's because they haven't tried hard enough.

02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:20.800
And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.600
with something is that they haven't paid attention

02:21:22.600 --> 02:21:25.720
well enough and that they haven't listened,

02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:26.720
as you were saying.

02:21:27.720 --> 02:21:30.240
So I do think there's something to that.

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:32.320
I think that's a deep insight.

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:36.760
On the other hand, the perfection of that insight

02:21:36.760 --> 02:21:41.320
is that nothing is ever anything less than joyful.

02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:47.280
And I actually think that Dostoevsky and Melville both agree,

02:21:48.480 --> 02:21:50.880
but in very different ways,

02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:55.880
that life involves a wide range of moods

02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:59.680
and that all of them are important.

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:01.120
It involves grief.

02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:05.400
Like I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grief.

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:09.640
And it's not in the first instance joyful.

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:13.720
It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel

02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:17.320
when you feel them more intense,

02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:20.800
but it makes them more intense by putting you

02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:23.920
in the position of experiencing the opposite.

02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.280
And it's only because we're capable of a wide range

02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:31.680
of passionate responses to situations

02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:35.000
that I think the significances can be as meaningful

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.520
as they are.

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.080
Melville, again, has this sort of interest.

02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.760
I mean, let's just say the guilt and the grief

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.480
in the Brothers Karamazov.

02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:48.840
Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.

02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.000
He's grieving.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.400
It's super important that he's grieving.

02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:55.880
He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:59.280
where he sees the sort of deep sort of beauty

02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:02.280
of everything that is, but it comes through the grief,

02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:04.320
not by avoiding the grief.

02:23:04.640 --> 02:23:06.840
And Melville says something like,

02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:08.640
Ishmael says something like,

02:23:08.640 --> 02:23:11.280
he says, I'm like a Catskill Mountain Eagle,

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:13.160
the Catskill Mountains nearby.

02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:17.520
He says, who's sort of flying high above the earth,

02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:20.600
going over the peaks and down into the valleys.

02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:23.040
I have these ups and these downs,

02:23:23.040 --> 02:23:26.480
but they're all invested with a kind of significance.

02:23:26.480 --> 02:23:29.840
They all happen at an enormously high height

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:31.880
because it's through the mountains that I'm flying.

02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:35.080
And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up.

02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.360
But it's really down.

02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:38.720
It's just that it's a way of being up

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:40.760
because it makes the ups even upper.

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.440
Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.720
can be destructive.

02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:50.560
I mean, I tend to see, for example, grief,

02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:54.840
a loss of love as part of love

02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:58.720
in that it's a celebration of the richness of feelings

02:23:58.720 --> 02:24:01.960
you had when you had the love.

02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:04.200
So it's like, it's all part of the same experience.

02:24:04.200 --> 02:24:07.280
But if you turn it into an optimization problem

02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:09.800
where everything can be unborable,

02:24:09.800 --> 02:24:11.840
then that can in itself be destructive.

02:24:11.840 --> 02:24:13.480
Yeah. Yeah.

02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:16.480
I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace

02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.320
on the internet where it's a video of him

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:23.000
and there's like a foreign sounding reporter

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.120
asking him questions.

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:27.000
I think she's, there's an accent of some sort,

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.800
German, I think, something like that.

02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:31.520
And I don't know, it just painted a picture

02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:33.200
of such a human person.

02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:35.000
We were talking about listening.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.960
The interviewer, if I may say,

02:24:37.800 --> 02:24:41.280
wasn't a very good one in the beginning.

02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:45.200
So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things

02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:47.000
of just kind of generic questions

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.640
and just kind of asking very basic questions.

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:53.720
But he brought out something in her over time.

02:24:53.720 --> 02:24:56.920
And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her

02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:00.720
and also sensitive to being a thinking

02:25:00.720 --> 02:25:02.720
and acting human in this world

02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:04.600
that's just painted such a beautiful picture

02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:07.040
that people should go definitely check out.

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:08.240
They made me really sad

02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.240
that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers,

02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:15.600
all of the ones we've been talking about.

02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.200
Just that almost this little accidental view

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.720
of this human being.

02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:21.560
I don't know.

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:22.640
There was a beautiful one.

02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:25.720
And I guess there's not many like that even of him.

02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:26.920
Yeah, yeah.

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.920
No, I think he was more than his writing ability,

02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:34.040
which was extraordinary.

02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:35.880
He had developed a style that was, I think,

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:38.240
unlike anyone else's style.

02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:43.760
It was his sensitivity to other people

02:25:43.760 --> 02:25:48.760
and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.

02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:54.040
In one of his essays,

02:25:54.040 --> 02:25:55.640
I think it's the one called

02:25:55.640 --> 02:25:58.040
An Incredibly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again.

02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:00.640
Did you know that one about cruise ships?

02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:04.360
I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball

02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:09.360
that just sort of walks around the ship noticing things.

02:26:10.080 --> 02:26:12.240
And he was incredibly good at that.

02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:18.120
But I also worry that that reflects something

02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:21.360
that you find in Ivan in the Brothers Karamazov.

02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.680
Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part.

02:26:23.760 --> 02:26:26.280
When he's away at school as a young,

02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:27.400
at college as a young boy,

02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:32.400
he makes money by going around town

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:35.120
to where tragic events have occurred.

02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:37.040
Someone just got run over by a carriage

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:39.520
or something just happened.

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.520
And being the first one there,

02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:44.080
he always knows somehow

02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:45.800
where these things are gonna happen.

02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:47.600
And writing about it,

02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:49.800
giving this really good description

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:51.960
and then signing it eyewitness.

02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:57.960
And it's as if Ivan's understanding of his life

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:01.960
is that he was supposed to be a witness to it.

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.640
He was supposed to see others, but not get involved.

02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:08.600
He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things

02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:09.440
from happening.

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:12.120
He just wants to report on them when he sees them.

02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.320
And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person,

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:21.080
character, and it's his isolation from others,

02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.120
from the love of others and his inability,

02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:27.160
his desire not to love others

02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:29.600
because that attaches him to someone

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:34.280
that I think is really at the ground of his condition.

02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:37.480
And I think that aim to be isolated,

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:39.280
which many people have nowadays.

02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:40.880
I mean, you see it in the underground man too,

02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:44.200
just sort of taking yourself out of the world

02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:48.440
because you don't wanna have to take responsibility

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:50.840
for being involved with others.

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:52.400
I think that's a bad move.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:55.400
And I do worry that maybe,

02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.080
I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace.

02:27:57.080 --> 02:28:00.960
I have no right to comment on his life,

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:05.720
but he portrays himself in that one episode

02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:07.720
as a person who does that.

02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:09.280
And I think that's dangerous.

02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:11.400
Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive

02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:12.880
to the world, like I find myself,

02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:16.000
the source of joy for me is just being really sensitive

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:19.120
to the world, to experience.

02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.480
There's some way, it's quite brilliant

02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.160
what you're saying that that could be isolating.

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:30.160
It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species

02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:32.400
on an island you don't want to interfere with.

02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:33.520
You find it so beautiful

02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:36.800
that you don't want to interfere with its beauty.

02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:41.800
So there is some sense in which that isolates you

02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:44.120
and then you find yourself deeply alone,

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:48.120
away from the experiences that bring you joy.

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.560
And that can be destructive.

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:54.800
That's fascinating how that works.

02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.240
And in his case, of course, some of it is

02:28:58.920 --> 02:29:00.960
just chemicals in his brain,

02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:04.920
but some of it is the path,

02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:09.040
his philosophy of life let him down.

02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:11.080
And that's the danger we need you to

02:29:11.080 --> 02:29:12.600
in gazing into the abyss.

02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:17.840
Your job is a difficult one

02:29:17.840 --> 02:29:21.160
because doing philosophy changes you.

02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:26.720
And you may not know how it changes you

02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:29.440
until you're changed and you look in the mirror.

02:29:32.040 --> 02:29:35.120
You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:38.240
saying that AI can't be an artist.

02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:44.280
Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.

02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:47.440
You mentioned Burt and criticism of symbolic AI.

02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:53.040
Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible,

02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.800
the capacity for artistry and creativity

02:29:55.800 --> 02:29:58.840
in our robot friends?

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:00.960
Yeah, I can try.

02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:06.600
So to make the argument,

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:11.600
you have to have in mind what counts as art,

02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:16.160
what counts as a creative artistic act.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:22.200
I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.

02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:26.800
I mean, we say that good art is original,

02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:30.280
but not everything that's never been done before is good art.

02:30:31.200 --> 02:30:36.000
So there has to be more than just doing something new.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:39.600
It has to be somehow doing something new

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:43.440
in a way that speaks to the audience

02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:47.840
or speaks to some portion of the audience at least.

02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:52.160
It has to be doing something new in such a way

02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:56.640
that some people who see or interact with it

02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:00.040
can see themselves anew in it.

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:04.440
So I think that art is inherently a creative act.

02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:08.720
Sorry, a kind of communicative act

02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:13.360
that it involves a relation with other people.

02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:18.360
So think about the conditions for that working.

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:21.480
Someone, I talk in that article,

02:31:21.480 --> 02:31:23.400
I can't remember, something about new music.

02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:24.920
I think I don't talk about Stravinsky,

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:26.440
but let's say Stravinsky.

02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:32.920
Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:38.520
It is new and people hate it.

02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:42.320
People can't, it sounds like a cacophony.

02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:43.640
It sounds awful.

02:31:43.640 --> 02:31:46.000
It's written according to principles

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.680
that are not like the principles of music composition

02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:50.880
that people are familiar with.

02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:53.680
So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.

02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:58.080
But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff,

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.600
I mean, we now can recognize

02:32:01.440 --> 02:32:03.320
it wasn't a failed communicative act.

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.960
It just hadn't reached its time yet.

02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:13.440
And now that way of composing music is like,

02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:15.640
it's in Disney movies.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:19.280
It's so part of our musical palette

02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:21.880
that we don't have that response.

02:32:21.880 --> 02:32:23.680
It changed us.

02:32:23.680 --> 02:32:27.480
It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.

02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:29.600
So that's a deep communicative act.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:34.640
It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment,

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:40.280
but it did ultimately establish a new understanding

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:42.320
for all of us of what counts as good art.

02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:45.160
And that's the kind of deep communication

02:32:45.160 --> 02:32:47.200
that I think good art can do.

02:32:47.200 --> 02:32:52.080
It can change our understanding of ourselves

02:32:52.080 --> 02:32:54.680
and of what a good manifestation

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:57.680
of something of ourselves in a certain domain is.

02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:00.440
And you used the term socially embedded,

02:33:00.440 --> 02:33:04.280
that art is fundamentally socially embedded.

02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:05.920
And I really liked that term

02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:10.280
because I see my love for artificial intelligence

02:33:10.280 --> 02:33:12.520
and the kind of system that we can bring to the world

02:33:12.520 --> 02:33:17.520
that could make for an interesting and more lively world

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:19.920
and one that enriches human beings

02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:24.080
is one where the AI systems are deeply socially embedded.

02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:25.120
Cool, yeah.

02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:27.560
So that, and that actually is in contrast

02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:30.240
to the way artificial intelligence

02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:32.200
have been talked about throughout its history.

02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:36.000
And certainly now, both on the robotic side and the AI side,

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.600
it's especially on the tech sector

02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:41.760
where the businesses around AI,

02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:45.200
they kind of want to create systems

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:48.400
that are like servants to humans.

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:52.760
And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness

02:33:52.760 --> 02:33:55.520
of where art would be part.

02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.520
I think that there is no reason

02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:01.560
why you can't integrate AI systems

02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:04.800
in the way you integrate new humans to the picture.

02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:07.520
There are just the full diversity and the flaws,

02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:10.040
all of that adds to the thing.

02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:15.480
Some people might say that AlphaZero

02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:18.320
is this system from DeepMind

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:23.000
that was able to achieve, you know, solve the game.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.840
It beat the best people in the world at the game of Go

02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:28.000
with no supervision from humans.

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.800
But more interestingly to me, on the side of creativity,

02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.400
it was able to surprise a lot of grandmasters

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:36.600
with the kind of moves they came up with.

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.400
Now, to me, that's not the creativity,

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.520
the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking about.

02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:48.520
That is merely revealing the limitations of humans

02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:50.800
to discover.

02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:55.080
It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:35:01.000
I think creativity is not just even socially embedded.

02:35:03.320 --> 02:35:04.840
It's the way you're saying

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:07.480
it's part of the communicative act.

02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.920
It's the interactive.

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.200
It's the dance with the culture.

02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:15.240
And so it has to be like for AlphaZero

02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:17.800
to be creative, truly creative,

02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:20.200
it would have to be integrated in a way

02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:22.240
where it has a Twitter account

02:35:22.240 --> 02:35:26.280
and it becomes aware of the impact

02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:28.120
it has on the other grandmasters

02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:30.120
with the moves that's coming up.

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:33.480
And one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero,

02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:37.080
which I just love so much,

02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:39.080
is I don't know if you're familiar with chess.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.360
I am, yeah.

02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:44.480
So it does certain things that most chess players,

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:47.440
even at the highest level, don't do,

02:35:47.440 --> 02:35:49.280
which is it sacrifices pieces.

02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:53.720
It gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves

02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:55.560
before it pays you back.

02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:58.360
So to me, that's beautiful.

02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:01.920
That's art if only AlphaZero understood

02:36:01.920 --> 02:36:03.400
the artistry of that,

02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:07.160
which is I'm going to mess with you psychologically

02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:09.880
because I'm going to do two things.

02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:14.280
One, make you feel overconfident that you're doing well,

02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:17.760
but actually also once you realize you are playing AlphaZero

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.240
that is much better than you,

02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:21.400
you're going to feel really nervous

02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:22.880
about what's on the way.

02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:24.520
This is the calm before the storm.

02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:28.800
And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:29.960
of this chess game.

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:33.640
If only AlphaZero was then messing with you

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:35.240
additionally to that,

02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:37.480
and was cognizant of this doing that,

02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.960
then it becomes art.

02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:42.840
And then it's integrated into society in that way.

02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:45.760
And I believe it doesn't have to actually have

02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:50.760
an understanding of the world in the way that humans have.

02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:52.640
It can have a different one.

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:55.600
It can be like a child is clueless

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:58.520
about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.

02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.720
And that's part of the magic of it.

02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:04.200
Just being flawed, being lacking understanding

02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:06.600
all interesting kinds of ways, but interacting.

02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:10.640
And so to me, it's possible to create art for AI,

02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:12.960
but exactly as you're saying

02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:16.280
in a deeply socially embedded way.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.120
Good.

02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:18.800
Well, I think we agree,

02:37:18.800 --> 02:37:21.000
but let me just highlight the thing

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.560
that makes me think that we agree,

02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:28.400
which is that I think for people, for community,

02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:32.960
to allow themselves to recognize

02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.040
in a certain kind of creative act,

02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:37.760
I'm thinking of Stravinsky here,

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:40.280
but we could think of a chess thing,

02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:43.280
to recognize in a certain kind of creative act,

02:37:43.280 --> 02:37:47.400
a new and admirable worthy way of thinking

02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:50.040
about what's significant in the situation.

02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.320
You have to believe that it wasn't random.

02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.720
You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way

02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:03.720
because he was receptive to what needed to be said now.

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:09.640
And so you said if only AlphaZero

02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:13.960
could do all this by virtue of recognizing

02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:16.480
that this was the thing that needed to be done,

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.640
then it would be socially embedded in the right way.

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:21.600
And I think I agree with that.

02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:26.120
First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain,

02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.120
a game playing domain, Go or chess.

02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:30.760
Go is more complicated than chess,

02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:32.520
but either one of them,

02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.960
because there really are only a finite range

02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:39.080
of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point.

02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:43.560
It's a combinatorial problem in the end.

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:48.560
Now, obviously AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem

02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:50.280
in a combinatorial way.

02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:53.120
That would be sort of take too much energy.

02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:54.080
You couldn't do it.

02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.840
It's too, it sort of explodes the problem.

02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:00.920
So it does it in this other way that's interesting,

02:39:00.920 --> 02:39:03.440
this pattern recognition way roughly.

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:08.440
And in that context, it may well be that it can see,

02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:12.360
having had lots and lots of experience

02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.640
in the training stuff against itself

02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:17.040
or against another version of itself,

02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.920
it can see that the sacrifice here

02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:21.000
is gonna pay dividends down the road.

02:39:22.080 --> 02:39:25.200
See, I put that in quotation marks.

02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:30.200
That's to say it's got a high weight to this move here.

02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:33.040
As a result of experience in the past

02:39:33.040 --> 02:39:38.040
where that move down the line led to this improvement.

02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:41.520
So in that finite context,

02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:44.800
I think the game players can trust it

02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:46.400
and they talk that way.

02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:48.320
That it's got a kind of authority.

02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.160
They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero

02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:57.600
when I played Go, it's like it's playing from the future.

02:39:58.440 --> 02:40:03.440
It's making these moves that are just outlandish

02:40:03.440 --> 02:40:06.120
and there's a kind of brilliance to them

02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:07.680
that we can't really understand.

02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:09.800
We'll be catching up to it forever.

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:13.560
I think in that context, it's mapped the domain

02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:14.960
and the domain is mappable

02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:18.120
because it's a combinatorial problem roughly.

02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:23.120
But in something like music or art of a non-finite form,

02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:28.440
it feels to me like it's a little harder for me

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:34.600
to understand what the analog of our trusting

02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.720
that Stravinsky has recognized something about us

02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:41.120
that demands that he write this way.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.880
That doesn't seem like a finite thing

02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:45.480
in quite the same way.

02:40:45.480 --> 02:40:48.680
Now we could ask the system, why did you do it?

02:40:48.680 --> 02:40:52.120
We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?

02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:55.360
And maybe it will have answers,

02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:59.040
but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.

02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:02.760
And I think lots of times artists will often say,

02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:05.280
look, I can't communicate better

02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.480
than what I've done in the piece of work.

02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:08.720
That is the statement.

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.360
Yeah, so yeah, we humans aren't able to answer the why either.

02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:16.480
But I do think the question here is,

02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:20.400
well, first of all, language is finite.

02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:23.080
Certainly when expressed through a tweet.

02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:25.600
So it is also a combinatorial problem.

02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:29.240
The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.

02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:34.240
And I think all the same ways that we see

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:38.200
the solutions to chess is deeply surprising

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:42.080
when it was first addressed with IBM D-Blue

02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:46.760
and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.

02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:51.320
I think in that same way, language can be addressed

02:41:51.320 --> 02:41:53.360
and communication can be addressed.

02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:56.680
I don't see, having done this podcast,

02:41:56.680 --> 02:41:59.680
many reasons why everything I'm doing,

02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:02.720
especially as a digital being on the internet,

02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:06.160
can't be done by an AI system eventually.

02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:10.840
So I think we're being very human-centric

02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:11.960
and thinking we're special.

02:42:11.960 --> 02:42:14.920
I think one of the hardest things is the physical space.

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:20.200
Actually operating touch and the magic of body language

02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:21.640
and the music of all of that,

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.800
because it's so deeply integrated

02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:26.600
through the long evolutionary process

02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:29.120
of what it's like to be on earth.

02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:31.920
What is fundamentally different,

02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:35.440
and AI can catch up on,

02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:39.760
is the way we apply our evolutionary history

02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:42.160
on the way we act on the internet,

02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:43.760
on the way we act online.

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:46.560
And as more and more of the world becomes digital,

02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.200
you're now operating in a space

02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:53.200
where AI is behind much less so.

02:42:53.320 --> 02:42:55.120
Like we're both starting at zero.

02:42:56.080 --> 02:42:57.640
I think that's super interesting.

02:42:57.640 --> 02:43:01.240
Do you know this author, Brian Christian?

02:43:01.240 --> 02:43:02.800
Is that someone you've ever heard of?

02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:04.000
That sounds familiar.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:07.600
He's a guy who competed in the,

02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:08.440
what is it called?

02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:09.280
The Loebner Competition.

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:10.200
The Loebner Prize, yeah.

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:12.200
Yeah, the Turing Test thing.

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:14.440
And I'll just tell you the story,

02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:16.160
but I think it's directly related

02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:17.440
to the last thing you said

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:20.040
about where we're starting in the same place.

02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:24.280
He competed in this competition,

02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:27.280
but he didn't enter a program

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:30.720
that was supposed to try to pass the Turing Test.

02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:32.480
The Turing Test, there's three people.

02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.520
There's the judge, there's the program,

02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:38.400
and then there's someone who's a human the way they do it.

02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:41.040
And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions

02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:43.080
which is the computer and which is the human.

02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:45.000
So little known fact,

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.320
there's two prizes in that competition.

02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:49.800
There's the most human computer prize.

02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:51.800
That's the computer that wins the most.

02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:54.800
And then there's the most human-human prize.

02:43:54.800 --> 02:43:57.760
And he competed for the most human-human prize.

02:43:57.760 --> 02:43:58.600
And he won it.

02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:59.720
He kept winning it.

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:04.080
And so he tried to think about what it is

02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.360
that you have to be able to do

02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:08.760
in order to convince judges

02:44:08.760 --> 02:44:10.960
that you're human instead of a computer.

02:44:11.880 --> 02:44:14.320
And that's an interesting question, I think.

02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:16.560
And what he came to,

02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:19.600
my takeaway from his version of this story

02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:22.160
is that it is true

02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:26.360
that computers are winning these contests more and more

02:44:27.560 --> 02:44:29.800
as technology progresses.

02:44:29.800 --> 02:44:32.600
But there's two possible explanations for that.

02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:35.040
One is that the computers are becoming more human,

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:37.920
and the other is that the humans

02:44:37.920 --> 02:44:41.440
are becoming more like computers.

02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:43.400
And he says, actually,

02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:47.640
the more we live our lives in this world

02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:50.400
where in this sort of technological world

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:54.760
where we have to moderate our behavior

02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:56.640
so that it's readable

02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:01.640
by something that's effectively a computer,

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:04.680
the more we become like that.

02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:07.760
And he says, it happens even when you're

02:45:07.760 --> 02:45:09.320
not interacting with a computer.

02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:11.200
He says, have you ever been to the,

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:14.600
on the phone with the call center?

02:45:14.600 --> 02:45:16.440
And they're going through their script,

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:17.960
and that's what they've got to do.

02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.640
They've got to go through their script

02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:21.640
because that's how they keep their job.

02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:22.880
And they ask you this question,

02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:24.200
you've got to answer it.

02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:27.280
And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person,

02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.080
even though it's a person,

02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:30.880
because they've so given up

02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:33.080
everything that's involved normally

02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:35.360
with being able to make judgments

02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:37.200
and decisions and act in situations

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:38.800
and take responsibility.

02:45:38.800 --> 02:45:42.760
And so I think that's the other side of it.

02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:46.560
It is true that technology is amazing

02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:49.960
and can solve huge ranges of problems

02:45:49.960 --> 02:45:52.640
and do fantastic things.

02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.080
But it's also true that we're changing ourselves

02:45:56.080 --> 02:45:57.760
in response to it.

02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.520
And the one thing I'm worried about

02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:01.880
is that we're changing ourselves

02:46:01.880 --> 02:46:05.040
in such a way that the norms

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:08.480
for what we're aiming at are being changed

02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:11.800
to move in the direction of this sort of efficiently

02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:14.640
and in an optimized way solving a problem

02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.440
and move away from this other kind of thing

02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.640
that we were calling aliveness or significance.

02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:25.000
And so that's the other side of the story.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:25.920
And that's the worry,

02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:28.000
but it's very possible that there is,

02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:31.320
for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs,

02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:35.800
we may not see the aliveness in TikTok,

02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:38.720
the aliveness in the digital space,

02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:41.040
that you see it as us being dragged

02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.720
into this over-optimized world,

02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:48.640
but that may be this is, in fact,

02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:51.840
it is a world that opens up opportunities

02:46:51.840 --> 02:46:54.800
to truly experience life.

02:46:54.800 --> 02:46:56.920
And there's interesting to think about

02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:58.920
all the people growing up now

02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:02.320
who their early experience of life

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:05.000
is always mediated through a digital device,

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.960
not always, but more and more often

02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:08.600
mediated through that device,

02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.840
and how we're both evolving.

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:13.640
The technology is evolving and the humans are evolving

02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:16.440
to then maybe open a door to a whole world

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:18.680
where the humans and the technology

02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:22.760
or AI systems are interacting as equals.

02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:24.080
So now I'm gonna agree with you.

02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:26.640
You might be surprised that I'm gonna agree with you,

02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:28.240
but I think that's exactly right.

02:47:28.240 --> 02:47:30.960
I don't wanna be the person who's saying

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:34.520
our job is to resist all of this stuff.

02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:35.760
I don't wanna be a Luddite.

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:37.120
That's not my goal.

02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:40.400
The goal is to point out

02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:44.400
that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.

02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:45.240
Yes.

02:47:46.760 --> 02:47:49.080
The point is to get in the right relation

02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:51.160
to that understanding of what we are.

02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:54.400
That allows us to find the joy in it.

02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:56.880
And I think that's a hard thing to do.

02:47:56.920 --> 02:47:58.480
It's hard to understand even what we're supposed

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:00.560
to be doing when we do it.

02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:03.880
Maybe I, more than you, am not of the right generation

02:48:03.880 --> 02:48:06.080
to be able to do that.

02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:07.600
But I do think that's gotta be the move.

02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:09.240
The move is not to resist it.

02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:11.200
It's not a nostalgic move.

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.880
It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it

02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:18.720
that's not the relation of it controlling you

02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:20.480
and depriving you of stuff,

02:48:20.480 --> 02:48:22.920
but of your recognizing some great joy

02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:24.640
that can be found in it.

02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:27.560
When I interact with leg of robots,

02:48:27.560 --> 02:48:29.520
I see there's magic there.

02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:32.880
And I just feel like the person who hears the music

02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:33.960
when others don't.

02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:35.440
And I don't know what that is.

02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:37.120
And I'd love to explore that.

02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:37.960
Yeah.

02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:39.720
And because it seems to,

02:48:39.720 --> 02:48:42.920
it's almost like the future talking.

02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:45.160
And I'm trying to hear what it's saying.

02:48:45.160 --> 02:48:48.200
Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?

02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:51.720
Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that.

02:48:51.720 --> 02:48:53.560
Those used to be things that I found

02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:56.200
overwhelmingly exciting.

02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:00.440
And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore.

02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:03.880
I mean, I'm not now closed off from that,

02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:06.000
even though my views are changed

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:07.960
and I don't work in that world.

02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:11.160
But I do think, I think it's interesting

02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.280
to figure out what's at the ground of that response.

02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:15.320
Yeah.

02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:19.080
We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout

02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.560
in a secular age,

02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:22.680
but let me ask you the big ridiculous question,

02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:23.880
almost too big.

02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.880
What is the meaning of this thing we've got going on?

02:49:27.880 --> 02:49:30.160
What is the meaning of life?

02:49:30.160 --> 02:49:33.960
You're saving the softball for the end.

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:35.800
Easy one.

02:49:35.800 --> 02:49:37.960
I don't know what the meaning of life is.

02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:41.600
I think there's something that characterizes us

02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:44.360
that's not the thing that people normally think

02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.560
characterizes us.

02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:48.040
The traditional thing to say

02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:49.480
and the philosophical tradition,

02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:51.240
even in the AI tradition,

02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:56.040
which is a kind of manifestation of philosophy

02:49:56.040 --> 02:49:58.280
from Plato for the traditional thing to say

02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:02.000
is that what characterizes us is our rationality,

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:03.520
that we're intelligent beings,

02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:06.640
that we're the ones that think.

02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:11.040
And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.

02:50:11.040 --> 02:50:14.800
But I think there's more to it too.

02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:19.800
I think we're capable of experiencing something

02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:26.240
simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness

02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.960
of everything that's meaningful in our existence

02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:34.360
and also the real significance of it.

02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:38.120
And that sounds like a contradiction.

02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:39.840
How could it really be significant

02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:41.320
and not be based on anything?

02:50:42.200 --> 02:50:43.640
But I think that's the contradiction

02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:45.840
that somehow characterizes us.

02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:47.920
And I think that we're the being

02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:52.400
that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us

02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:55.560
and live in the light of it.

02:50:55.560 --> 02:50:59.200
That's the thing that I think is really at our core.

02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:00.440
And so how do we do that?

02:51:00.440 --> 02:51:02.240
I will say this one thing.

02:51:03.120 --> 02:51:05.120
And I learned it from a philosopher,

02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:07.080
from a guy named Albert Borgman,

02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:08.880
who's a German philosopher,

02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:09.920
lived in Montana now,

02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:13.000
taught in Montana for his whole career.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.760
And I say this to my students at Harvard now.

02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:19.920
He said, this is the way that I think about my life.

02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:22.680
And I hope you'll think about your life too.

02:51:22.680 --> 02:51:24.920
He said, you should think about your life

02:51:26.280 --> 02:51:31.280
hoping that there will be many moments in it

02:51:31.480 --> 02:51:33.320
about which you can say,

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:36.000
there's no place I'd rather be.

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:40.280
There's no thing I'd rather be doing.

02:51:41.600 --> 02:51:44.320
There's no buddy I'd rather be with.

02:51:45.240 --> 02:51:47.560
And this I will remember well.

02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:52.120
And I think if you can aim to fill your life

02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:54.360
with moments like that, it will be a meaningful one.

02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.760
I don't know if that's the meaning of life,

02:51:56.760 --> 02:51:59.280
but I think if you can hold that before you,

02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:01.800
it'll help to clarify this mystery

02:52:01.800 --> 02:52:04.120
and this sort of bizarre situation

02:52:04.120 --> 02:52:05.480
in which we find ourselves.

02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:09.000
Sean, this conversation was incredible.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
And those four requirements

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.640
have certainly been fulfilled for me.

02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:17.440
This was a magical moment in that way

02:52:17.440 --> 02:52:18.960
and I will remember it well.

02:52:18.960 --> 02:52:20.000
Thank you so much.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.760
It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.

02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:23.600
This is great.

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:24.440
Thank you.

02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:25.440
Thank you for having me, Lex.

02:52:25.440 --> 02:52:27.560
I really, really enjoyed it.

02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:30.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:31.800

02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:38.040
And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:40.520
In the depth of winter,

02:52:40.520 --> 02:52:43.200
I finally learned that within me

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:45.400
there lay an invincible summer.

02:52:46.280 --> 02:52:49.080
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
