00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
If the goal is the project of human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is, you cannot

00:05.800 --> 00:10.540
know the world as it is without knowing what people really think.

00:10.540 --> 00:15.000
And what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.460
So every time you're actually saying, you can't say that, you're actually depriving

00:19.460 --> 00:21.880
yourself of the knowledge of what people really think.

00:21.880 --> 00:27.440
You're causing what Timur Karan, who's on our board of advisors, calls preference falsification.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.600
You end up with an inaccurate picture of the world, which by the way, in a lot of cases,

00:32.600 --> 00:36.200
because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually tend to think that

00:36.200 --> 00:38.480
people are more prejudiced than they might be.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.280
And actually one very real practical way it makes things worse is when you censor people,

00:44.280 --> 00:46.560
it doesn't change their opinion.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.900
It just encourages them to not share it with people who will get them in trouble.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.440
So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization

00:55.440 --> 00:58.680
takes off.

00:58.680 --> 01:03.440
The following is a conversation with Greg Lukianoff, free speech advocate, First Amendment

01:03.440 --> 01:09.160
attorney, president and CEO of FIRE, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.840
And he's the author of Unleashing Liberty, co-author with Jonathan Haidt of Coddling

01:14.840 --> 01:21.200
of the American Mind, and co-author with Ricky Schlott of a new book coming out in October,

01:21.440 --> 01:26.560
that you should definitely pre-order now, called The Cancelling of the American Mind,

01:26.560 --> 01:31.920
which is a definitive accounting of the history, present and future of cancel culture, a term

01:31.920 --> 01:38.040
used and overused in public discourse, but rarely studied and understood with the depth

01:38.040 --> 01:45.160
and rigor that Greg and Ricky do in this book and in part in this conversation.

01:45.160 --> 01:51.040
Freedom of speech is important, especially on college campuses, the very place that should

01:51.040 --> 01:57.280
serve as the battleground of ideas, including weird and controversial ones that should encourage

01:57.280 --> 02:01.680
bold risk taking, not conformity.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.800
This is a Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.280
And now, dear friends, here's Greg Lukianoff.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.920
Let's start with the big question, what is cancel culture?

02:14.920 --> 02:19.000
Now you've said that you don't like the term as it's been, quote, dragged through the mud

02:19.000 --> 02:22.600
and abused endlessly by a whole host of controversial figures.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.760
Nevertheless, we have the term, what is it?

02:25.760 --> 02:30.920
Cancel culture is the uptick of campaigns, especially successful campaigns, starting

02:30.920 --> 02:39.120
around 2014 to get people fired, expelled, deplatformed, et cetera, for speech that would

02:39.120 --> 02:41.240
normally be protected by the First Amendment.

02:41.240 --> 02:46.400
And I say would be protected, because we're talking about circumstances in which it isn't

02:46.400 --> 02:48.420
necessarily where the First Amendment applies.

02:48.420 --> 02:53.820
But what I mean is, like, as an analog to, say, things you couldn't lose your job as

02:53.820 --> 03:00.780
a public employee for, and also the climate of fear that's resulted from that phenomena,

03:00.780 --> 03:03.560
the fact that you can lose your job for having the wrong opinion.

03:03.560 --> 03:09.780
And it wasn't subtle that there was an uptick in this, particularly on campus around 2014.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.820
John Ronson wrote a book called So You've Been Publicly Shamed.

03:12.820 --> 03:16.340
It came out in 2015, already documenting this phenomena.

03:16.340 --> 03:20.080
I wrote a book called Freedom From Speech in 2014.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.500
But it really was in 2017 when you started seeing this be directed at professors.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.740
And when it comes to the number of professors that we've seen be targeted and lose their

03:29.740 --> 03:34.640
jobs, I've been doing this for 22 years, and I've seen nothing like it.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.500
So there's so many things I want to ask you here.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.500
One actually, just look at the organization of fire.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.380
Can you explain what the organization is?

03:41.380 --> 03:46.580
Because it's interconnected to this whole fight and the rise of cancer culture and the

03:46.580 --> 03:50.440
fight for freedom of speech since 2014 and before.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.540
So fire was founded in 1999 by Harvey Sloverglate.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.620
He is a famous civil liberties attorney.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.700
He's been on the show.

03:58.700 --> 04:03.500
He's the person who actually found me out in my very happy life out in San Francisco,

04:03.500 --> 04:05.980
but knew I was looking for a First Amendment job.

04:05.980 --> 04:10.620
I'd gone to law school specifically to do First Amendment.

04:10.620 --> 04:13.260
And he found me, which was pretty cool.

04:13.260 --> 04:16.780
His protege, Kathleen Sullivan, was the dean of Stanford Law School.

04:16.780 --> 04:22.440
And this remains the best compliment I ever got in my life is that she recommended me

04:22.440 --> 04:24.140
to Harvey.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.300
And since that's the whole reason why I went to law school, I was excited to be a part

04:27.300 --> 04:29.060
of this new organization.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.860
The other co-founder of fire is Alan Charles Kors.

04:32.860 --> 04:34.860
He's just an absolute genius.

04:34.860 --> 04:39.560
He is the one of the leading experts in the world on the enlightenment and particularly

04:39.560 --> 04:41.280
about Voltaire.

04:41.280 --> 04:47.840
And if any of your listeners do like the great courses, he has a lecture on Blaise Pascal

04:47.840 --> 04:51.760
and Blaise, of course, is famous for the Pascal's Wager.

04:51.760 --> 04:57.440
And I left it just so moved and impressed and with a depth of understanding of how important

04:57.440 --> 04:59.840
this person was.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.840
That's interesting.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.760
You mentioned to me offline connected to this that there is that at least it runs in parallel

05:06.840 --> 05:10.680
or there's a connection between the love of science and the love of the freedom of speech.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
Yes.

05:11.680 --> 05:14.600
Can you maybe elaborate where that connection is?

05:14.600 --> 05:15.600
Sure.

05:15.600 --> 05:20.200
I think that for those of us who are really, you know, have devoted our lives to freedom

05:20.200 --> 05:27.240
of speech, one thing that we are into, whether we know it or not, is epistemology, you know,

05:27.240 --> 05:33.160
the study and philosophy of knowledge, you know, freedom speech has lots of moral and

05:33.160 --> 05:38.680
philosophical dimensions, but from a pragmatic standpoint, it is necessary because we're

05:38.680 --> 05:40.980
creatures of incredibly limited knowledge.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.520
We are incredibly self-deceiving.

05:43.520 --> 05:49.600
I always love the fact that Yuval Harari refers to the enlightenment as the discovery of ignorance

05:49.600 --> 05:51.560
because that's exactly what it was.

05:51.560 --> 05:57.320
It was suddenly being like, wow, hold on a second, all this incredibly interesting folk

05:57.320 --> 06:02.580
wisdom we got, which, by the way, can be surprisingly reliable here and there.

06:02.580 --> 06:07.740
When you start testing a lot of it is nonsense and it doesn't hold up.

06:07.740 --> 06:12.500
Even our ideas about the way things fall, you know, as Galileo established, like even

06:12.500 --> 06:15.800
our intuitions, they're just wrong.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.660
And so a lot of the early history of freedom of speech, it was happening at the same time

06:21.660 --> 06:24.460
as sort of the scientific revolution.

06:24.460 --> 06:28.340
So a lot of the early debates about freedom of speech were tied in.

06:28.460 --> 06:33.980
So certainly Galileo, you know, I always point out like Kepler was probably like the even

06:33.980 --> 06:39.180
more radical idea that there weren't even perfect spheres, but at the same time, largely

06:39.180 --> 06:43.980
because of the invention of the printing press, you also had all these political developments.

06:43.980 --> 06:53.220
And you know, I always talk about Jan Hus, you know, from the famous Czech hero who was

06:53.220 --> 06:56.540
burned at the stake, and I think in 1419.

06:56.540 --> 07:01.860
But he was basically Luther before the printing press.

07:01.860 --> 07:05.140
Before Luther could get his word out, you know, he didn't stand a chance.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.040
And that was exactly what Jan Hus was.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.220
But a century later, thanks to the printing press, everyone could know what Luther thought

07:11.220 --> 07:13.220
and boy, did they.

07:13.220 --> 07:19.340
But it led to, of course, this completely crazy, hyper disrupted period in European

07:19.340 --> 07:20.340
history.

07:20.460 --> 07:24.460
Well, you mentioned to jump around a little bit, the First Amendment, first of all, what

07:24.460 --> 07:25.460
is the First Amendment?

07:25.460 --> 07:30.340
And what is the connection to you between the First Amendment, the freedom of speech

07:30.340 --> 07:31.580
and cancel culture?

07:31.580 --> 07:32.580
Sure.

07:32.580 --> 07:37.580
So I'm a First Amendment lawyer, as I mentioned, and that's what I, that's my passion, that's

07:37.580 --> 07:38.580
what I studied.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.400
And I think American First Amendment law is incredibly interesting.

07:41.400 --> 07:47.140
In one sentence, the First Amendment is trying to get rid of basically all the reasons why

07:47.140 --> 07:51.620
humankind had been killing each other for its entire existence, that we weren't going

07:51.620 --> 07:53.420
to fight any more over opinion.

07:53.420 --> 07:56.980
We weren't going to fight any more religion, that you have the right to approach your government

07:56.980 --> 08:02.140
for redressing grievances, that you have the freedom to associate, that all of these things

08:02.140 --> 08:08.100
in one sentence were like, no, the government will no longer interfere with your right to

08:08.100 --> 08:12.140
have these fundamental human rights.

08:12.140 --> 08:17.260
And so one thing that makes FIRE a little different from other organizations is, however,

08:17.260 --> 08:22.820
we're not just a First Amendment organization, we are a free speech organization.

08:22.820 --> 08:31.380
And so, but at the same time, a lot of what I think free speech is, can be well explained

08:31.380 --> 08:36.420
with reference to a lot of First Amendment law, partially because in American history,

08:36.420 --> 08:40.220
some of our smartest people have been thinking about what the parameters of freedom of speech

08:40.380 --> 08:43.380
are in relationship to the First Amendment.

08:43.380 --> 08:48.420
And a lot of those principles, they transfer very well just as pragmatic ideas.

08:48.420 --> 08:53.420
So like the biggest sin in terms of censorship is called viewpoint discrimination, that essentially

08:53.420 --> 08:56.800
you allow freedom of speech except for that opinion.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.140
Now it's, and it's found to be kind of more defensible, and I think this makes sense,

09:01.140 --> 09:05.380
that if you set up a forum and like, we're only going to talk about economics to exclude

09:05.380 --> 09:07.820
people who want to talk about a different topic.

09:07.820 --> 09:13.380
So it's considered rightfully a bigger deal if you set up a forum for economics, but

09:13.380 --> 09:17.580
we're not going to let people talk about that kind of economics or have that opinion on

09:17.580 --> 09:20.660
economics, most particularly.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.520
So a lot of the principles from First Amendment law actually make a lot of philosophical

09:24.520 --> 09:30.140
sense as good principles for when, like what is protected and unprotected speech, what

09:30.140 --> 09:35.060
should get you in trouble, how you actually analyze it, which is why we actually try in

09:35.060 --> 09:38.900
our definition of cancel culture to work in some of the First Amendment norms just

09:38.900 --> 09:42.300
in the definition so we don't have to bog down on them as well.

09:42.300 --> 09:46.460
You're saying so many interesting things, but if you can linger on the viewpoint discrimination,

09:46.460 --> 09:51.860
is there any gray area of discussion there, like what is and isn't economics for the example

09:51.860 --> 09:52.860
you gave?

09:52.860 --> 09:53.860
Yeah.

09:53.860 --> 09:59.580
Is there, I mean, is it a science or is it an art to draw lines of what is and isn't

09:59.580 --> 10:00.580
allowed?

10:00.580 --> 10:01.580
Yeah.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.620
You know, if you're saying that something is or is not economics, well, you can say

10:03.620 --> 10:06.580
everything's economics and therefore I want to talk about poetry.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.720
There'd be some line drawing exercise in there.

10:08.720 --> 10:16.740
But let's say at once you decide to open up it to poetry even, it's a big difference

10:16.740 --> 10:22.860
between saying, okay, now we're open to poetry, but you can't say, you know, Dante was bad.

10:22.860 --> 10:27.620
Like that's a forbidden opinion now officially in this otherwise open forum.

10:27.620 --> 10:31.820
That would immediately at an intuitive level strike people as a bigger problem than just

10:31.820 --> 10:34.100
saying that poetry isn't economics.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.100
Yeah.

10:35.100 --> 10:43.140
I mean, that intuitive level that you speak to, I hope that all of us have that kind of

10:43.140 --> 10:45.500
basic intuition when the line is crossed.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.460
It's the same thing for like pornography, you know, when you see it, I think there's

10:49.460 --> 10:55.740
the same level of intuition that should be applied across the board here.

10:55.740 --> 11:00.620
And it's when that intuition becomes deformed by whatever forces of society, that's when

11:00.620 --> 11:02.540
it starts to feel like censorship.

11:02.540 --> 11:03.540
Yeah.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.180
I mean, people find it a different thing, you know, if someone loses their job simply

11:07.180 --> 11:11.260
for their political opinion, even if that employer has every right in the world to fire

11:11.260 --> 11:15.100
you, I think Americans should still be like, well, it's true, they have every right in

11:15.100 --> 11:19.740
the world and I'm not making a legal case that maybe you shouldn't fire someone for

11:19.740 --> 11:21.200
their political opinion.

11:21.200 --> 11:26.140
But think that through, like what kind of society do we want to live in?

11:26.140 --> 11:33.580
And it's been funny watching, you know, and I point this out, yes, I will defend businesses,

11:33.580 --> 11:38.180
First Amendment rights of association to be able to have the legal right to decide, you

11:38.180 --> 11:40.300
know, who works for them.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.820
But from a moral or philosophical matter, if you think through the implications of if

11:44.820 --> 11:51.060
every business in America becomes an expressive association in addition to being a profit

11:51.060 --> 11:55.780
maximizing organization, that would be a disaster for democracy because you would end up in

11:55.780 --> 11:59.800
a situation where people would actually be saying to themselves, I don't think I can

11:59.800 --> 12:04.420
actually say what I really think and still believe I can keep my job.

12:04.420 --> 12:07.640
And that's where I was worried I felt like we were headed because a lot of the initial

12:07.640 --> 12:14.540
response to people getting canceled was very simply, you know, oh, but they have the right

12:14.540 --> 12:16.580
to get rid of this person.

12:16.580 --> 12:20.840
And that's the end and beginning and end of the discussion.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.620
And I thought that was a dodge.

12:22.620 --> 12:27.060
I thought that wasn't actually a very serious way of that if you care about both the First

12:27.060 --> 12:30.260
Amendment and freedom of speech of thinking it through.

12:30.260 --> 12:38.820
To you just to clarify, the First Amendment is kind of a legal embodiment of the ideal

12:38.820 --> 12:42.780
of freedom of speech and freedom of speech applied to government and it's very specific

12:42.780 --> 12:48.980
applied to government and freedom of speech is the application of the principle to like

12:49.380 --> 12:55.820
everything including like kind of the high level philosophical ideal of what it of the

12:55.820 --> 12:59.300
value of people being able to speak their mind.

12:59.300 --> 13:04.340
Yeah, it's an older, bolder, more expansive idea.

13:04.340 --> 13:08.700
And you can have a situation and I talk about countries that have good free speech law,

13:08.700 --> 13:11.200
but not necessarily great free speech culture.

13:11.200 --> 13:15.440
And I talk about how when we sometimes make this distinction between free speech law and

13:15.440 --> 13:20.000
free speech culture, we're thinking in a very cloudy kind of way.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.320
And what I mean by that is that law is generally, particularly in a common law country, it's

13:26.320 --> 13:29.360
the reflection of norms.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.400
Those judges are people too and in a lot of cases, common law is supposed to actually

13:33.400 --> 13:38.520
take our intuitive ideas of fairness and place them into the law.

13:38.520 --> 13:42.680
So if you actually have a culture that doesn't appreciate free speech from a philosophical

13:42.680 --> 13:46.880
standpoint, it's not going to be able to protect free speech for the long haul even

13:46.880 --> 13:47.880
in the law.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.840
Because eventually that's one of the reasons why I worry so much about some of these terrible

13:50.840 --> 13:56.560
cases coming out of law schools, because I fear that even though sure, American First

13:56.560 --> 14:00.960
Amendment law is very strongly protective of First Amendment for now, it's not going

14:00.960 --> 14:06.560
to stay that way if you have generations of law students graduating who actually think

14:06.560 --> 14:10.160
there's nothing, there's no higher goal than shouting down your opponent.

14:10.640 --> 14:16.480
Yeah, so that's why so much of your focus or large fraction of your focus is on the

14:16.480 --> 14:22.800
higher education or education period is because education is the foundation of culture.

14:22.800 --> 14:29.120
Yeah, you have this history, you know, 64, you have the free speech movement on Berkeley

14:29.120 --> 14:34.440
and in 65, you have Repressive Tolerance by Herbert Marcuse, which was a declaration of,

14:34.600 --> 14:39.760
By the way, we on the left, we shouldn't, we should have free speech, but we should

14:39.760 --> 14:41.240
have free speech for us.

14:41.240 --> 14:49.000
I mean, I went back and reread Repressive Tolerance and how clear it is, I had forgotten

14:49.000 --> 14:52.940
that it really is kind of like, and these so-called conservatives and right wingers,

14:52.940 --> 14:55.960
we need to repress them because they're regressive thinkers.

14:55.960 --> 15:00.680
It really doesn't come out to anything more sophisticated than the very old idea that

15:00.680 --> 15:04.040
our people are good, they get free speech.

15:04.040 --> 15:11.000
They should keep it other side bad, we should not have, and we have to retrain society.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.960
And of course, like it ends up being another, he was also a fan of Mao, so it's not surprising

15:15.960 --> 15:22.600
that he, of course, the system would have to rely on some kind of totalitarian system.

15:22.600 --> 15:31.680
But that was a laughable position, you know, say 30, 40 years ago, the idea that essentially,

15:31.920 --> 15:37.680
free speech for me, not for the, as the great free speech champion that Hentov used to say,

15:37.680 --> 15:41.020
was something that you were supposed to be embarrassed by.

15:41.020 --> 15:46.240
But I saw this when I was in law school in 97, I saw this when I was interning at the

15:46.240 --> 15:53.840
ACLU in 99, that there was a slow motion train wreck coming, that essentially there was these

15:53.840 --> 16:00.680
bad ideas from campus that had been taking on more and more steam of basically no free

16:00.680 --> 16:06.520
speech for my opponent were actually becoming more and more accepted as, and partially because

16:07.080 --> 16:09.640
academia was becoming less and less viewpoint diverse.

16:09.640 --> 16:15.160
I think that as my co-author Jonathan Haidt points out, that when you have low viewpoint

16:15.160 --> 16:18.600
diversity, people start thinking in a very kind of tribal way.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.600
And if you don't have the respected dissenters, you don't have the people that you can point

16:22.600 --> 16:24.920
to them like, hey, this is a smart person.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.000
This is like, this is a smart, reasonable, decent person that I disagree with.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.040
So I guess not everyone thinks alike on this issue.

16:32.040 --> 16:37.560
You start getting much more kind of like only, you know, only bad people, only heretics,

16:37.560 --> 16:42.520
only blasphemers, only right-wingers, you know, can actually think in this way.

16:42.520 --> 16:47.000
Every time you say something, I always have a million thoughts and a million questions

16:47.000 --> 16:47.480
that pop up.

16:47.480 --> 16:51.160
But since you mentioned there's a kind of drift as you write about in the book,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.000
and you mentioned now there's a drift towards the left in academia,

16:55.960 --> 17:00.360
we should also maybe draw a distinction here between the left and the right and the cancel

17:00.360 --> 17:05.560
culture as you present in your book is not necessarily associated with any one political

17:05.560 --> 17:11.720
viewpoint, that there's mechanisms on both sides that result in cancellation and censorship

17:11.720 --> 17:13.080
in violation of freedom of speech.

17:13.080 --> 17:17.640
So one thing I want to be really clear about is the book takes on both right and left cancel

17:17.640 --> 17:18.280
culture.

17:18.280 --> 17:23.320
They're different in a lot of ways and definitely, you know, cancel culture from the left is more

17:23.320 --> 17:27.080
important in academia where the left dominates.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.240
But we talk a lot about cancel culture coming from legislatures.

17:31.240 --> 17:38.840
We talk a lot about cancel culture on campus as well because even though most of the attempts

17:38.840 --> 17:43.320
that come from on campus to get people canceled are still from the left, there are a lot of

17:43.320 --> 17:48.760
attacks that come from the right that come from, you know, attempts by different organizations.

17:48.760 --> 17:54.200
And sometimes when there are stories in Fox News, you know, like they'll go after professors.

17:54.200 --> 17:59.160
And about one third of the attempts to get professors punished that are successful actually

17:59.160 --> 18:00.280
do come from the right.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.240
And we talk about attempts to get books banned in the book.

18:05.240 --> 18:10.520
We talk about suing the Florida legislature.

18:10.520 --> 18:15.240
Ron DeSantis had something called the Stop Woke Act, which we told everyone.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.080
This is laughably unconstitutional.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.240
They tried to ban, you know, particular topics in higher ed.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.600
And we're like, no, this is a joke.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.320
This will be laughed out of court.

18:26.360 --> 18:32.920
And they didn't listen to us and they passed it and we sued and we won.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.400
Now they're trying again with something that's equally as unconstitutional and we will sue

18:37.400 --> 18:39.400
again and we will win.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
Can you elaborate on the Stop Woke Act?

18:41.400 --> 18:45.800
So this is presumably trying to limit certain topics from being taught in school?

18:45.800 --> 18:47.960
Yeah, it basically woke topics.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.440
It came out of the sort of attempt to get at critical race theory.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.440
So it's topics related to race, gender, et cetera.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.400
I don't remember exactly how they tried to cabinet to CRT.

19:02.520 --> 19:08.520
But when you actually, the law is really well established that you can't tell higher education

19:08.520 --> 19:13.000
what they're allowed to teach without violating the First Amendment.

19:13.000 --> 19:20.120
And when this got in front of a judge, he was exactly as skeptical of it as we thought

19:20.120 --> 19:20.440
he'd be.

19:20.440 --> 19:21.960
I think he called this dystopian.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.600
And it wasn't a close call.

19:24.600 --> 19:29.800
So if you're against that kind of teaching, the right way to fight it is by making the

19:29.800 --> 19:33.960
case that it's not a good idea as part of the curriculum as opposed to banning it from

19:33.960 --> 19:34.360
the curriculum.

19:34.360 --> 19:41.640
Yeah, just the state doesn't have the power to simply say, to ban what professors in higher

19:41.640 --> 19:42.760
education teach.

19:42.840 --> 19:47.560
Now, it gets a little more complicated when you talk about K through 12 because the state

19:47.560 --> 19:51.880
has a role in deciding what public K through 12 teaches because they're your kids,

19:52.680 --> 19:53.880
it's taxpayer funded.

19:54.680 --> 19:57.640
And generally, the legislature is involved.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.440
There is democratic oversight of that process.

20:00.440 --> 20:04.840
So for K through 12, is there also a lean towards the left in terms of the administration

20:04.840 --> 20:05.960
that manages the curriculum?

20:05.960 --> 20:09.400
Yeah, there definitely is in K through 12.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.760
I mean, my kids go to public school.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.080
I have a five and a seven year old.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.400
And they have lovely teachers.

20:20.280 --> 20:23.640
But we have run into a lot of problems with education schools at fire.

20:24.360 --> 20:28.200
And a lot of the graduates of education school end up being the administrators who clamp

20:28.200 --> 20:30.120
down on free speech in higher education.

20:30.920 --> 20:36.120
And so I've been trying to think of positive ways to take on some of the problems that

20:36.120 --> 20:37.400
I see in K through 12.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.560
I thought that the attempt to just dictate you won't teach the following 10 books or

20:43.560 --> 20:46.360
20 books or 200 books was the wrong way to do it.

20:46.360 --> 20:49.720
Now, when it comes to deciding what books are in the curriculum, again, that's something

20:49.720 --> 20:52.600
the legislature actually can't have some say in.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.960
And that's pretty uncontroversial in terms of the law.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.640
But when it comes to how you fight it, I had something that since I'm kind of stuck with

20:59.640 --> 21:03.080
a formula, I called empowering of the American mind.

21:03.080 --> 21:09.400
I gave principles that were inconsistent with the sort of group think and heavy emphasis

21:09.400 --> 21:16.200
on identity politics that some of the critics are rightfully complaining about in K through

21:16.200 --> 21:16.520
12.

21:18.920 --> 21:23.560
That is actually in canceling of the American mind, but I have a more detailed explanation

21:23.560 --> 21:27.240
of it that I'm going to be putting up on my blog, The Eternally Radical Idea.

21:27.480 --> 21:33.240
Is it possible to legally, this is a silly question perhaps, create an extra protection

21:33.240 --> 21:38.440
for certain kinds of literature, 1984 or something, to remain in the curriculum?

21:38.440 --> 21:40.200
I mean, it's already, it's all protected, I guess.

21:40.920 --> 21:47.720
I guess to protect against administrators from fiddling too much with the curriculum,

21:47.720 --> 21:49.400
like stabilizing the curriculum.

21:49.400 --> 21:53.800
I don't know what the machinery of the K through 12 public school.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.360
In K through 12, the state legislatures-

21:56.360 --> 21:57.960
They're part of that.

21:57.960 --> 22:01.320
They're part of that, and they can say, you should teach the following books.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.800
Now, of course, people are always a little bit worried that if they were to recommend,

22:07.960 --> 22:11.400
teach the Declaration of Independence, that it will end up being, well, they're going to

22:11.400 --> 22:15.560
teach the Declaration of Independence was just to protect slavery, which it wasn't.

22:15.560 --> 22:19.000
Yeah, so teaching a particular topic matters which textbooks you choose,

22:19.000 --> 22:20.840
which perspective you take, all that kind of stuff.

22:21.720 --> 22:27.400
Religion starts to creep into the whole question of is the Bible allowed to teach

22:27.400 --> 22:29.000
and to incorporate that into education?

22:29.960 --> 22:30.520
Don't, yeah.

22:30.520 --> 22:35.080
I mean, I'm an atheist with an intense interest in religion.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.200
I actually read the entire Bible this year just because I do stuff like that,

22:38.200 --> 22:40.280
and I never actually had read it from beginning to end.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.360
Then I read the Koran, and I'm going to try to do the Book of Mormon, but-

22:44.360 --> 22:46.360
Well, sorry, you're so fascinating.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.520
Do you recommend doing that?

22:48.520 --> 22:55.560
I think you should just to know because it's such a touchstone in the way people talk about

22:55.560 --> 23:02.360
things. It can get pretty tedious, but I even made myself read through all of the very specific

23:02.360 --> 23:07.560
instructions on how tall the different parts of the temple need to be, and how long the garbs

23:07.560 --> 23:15.720
need to be, and what shape they need to be, and those go on a lot. Surprisingly, a surprisingly

23:15.720 --> 23:21.080
big chunk of Exodus. I thought that was more in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, but then you get

23:21.080 --> 23:28.200
to books like Job. Wow. Job is such a read, and no way Job originally had that ending.

23:30.760 --> 23:37.240
It starts out as this perverse bet between God and Satan about whether or not they can actually

23:37.240 --> 23:41.240
make a good man renounce God, and initially they can't. It's all going very predictably.

23:41.880 --> 23:49.320
Then they finally really tortured Job, and he turns into the best, why is God cruel? How could

23:49.320 --> 23:54.600
God possibly exist? How could a kind God do these things? He turns into the best lawyer in the

23:54.600 --> 23:59.720
entire world, and he defeats everyone, all the people who come to argue with him. He argues the

23:59.720 --> 24:08.440
pants off of them. Then suddenly at the end, God shows up, and he's like, well, I am everywhere,

24:08.440 --> 24:15.800
and it's a very confusing answer. He gives an answer like, I am there when lionesses give birth,

24:15.800 --> 24:20.520
and I am there. By the way, there's this giant monster, Leviathan, that's very big, and it's

24:20.520 --> 24:26.120
very scary, and I have to manage the universe. I'm like, God, are you saying that you're very

24:26.120 --> 24:35.880
busy? Is that essentially your argument to Job? You don't mention the whole that I have a bet

24:35.880 --> 24:41.400
that's why I was torturing you. That doesn't come up. Then at the end, God decides, Job's like,

24:41.400 --> 24:46.680
oh, no, you're totally right. I was totally wrong. Sorry. God says, I'm going to punish

24:46.680 --> 24:52.520
those people who tried to argue with you and didn't win. I don't know exactly what he does

24:52.520 --> 24:58.600
to them. I don't remember. Then he gives Job all his money back, and it makes him super prosperous.

24:58.600 --> 25:05.160
I'm like, no way that was the original ending of that book, because this was clearly a beloved

25:05.160 --> 25:10.120
novel that they were like, but it can't have that ending. It's a long way of saying,

25:10.120 --> 25:15.080
I actually think it's worthwhile. You're always kind of surprised when you end up in the part,

25:16.840 --> 25:20.280
there are parts of it that will sneak up on you, kind of like Isaiah's a trip,

25:21.000 --> 25:26.440
Ecclesiastes to Peshmoat. You said you also, the Qur'an.

25:26.440 --> 25:31.800
Yeah, which was fascinating. It'd be interesting to ask, is there a tension between

25:32.760 --> 25:40.440
the study of religious texts or the following of religion and just believing in God and following

25:40.440 --> 25:47.320
the various aspects of religion with freedom of speech? In the First Amendment, we have something

25:47.320 --> 25:51.720
that we call the religion clause, and I've never liked calling it just that, because it's two

25:51.720 --> 25:57.000
brilliant things right next to each other. The state may not establish an official religion,

25:57.000 --> 26:02.600
but it cannot interfere with your right to practice your religion. Beautiful. Two things

26:02.600 --> 26:07.560
at the same time, and I think they're both exactly right. I think sometimes the right gets very

26:07.560 --> 26:11.880
excited of the free exercise clause, and the left gets very excited about establishment,

26:11.880 --> 26:15.000
and I like the fact that we have both of them together.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.840
Now, how does it relate to freedom of speech and how is it related to the curriculum,

26:18.840 --> 26:25.400
like we were talking about? I actually think it would be great if public schools could teach

26:26.200 --> 26:31.480
the Bible in the sense of read it as a historical document, but back when I was at the ACLU,

26:31.480 --> 26:37.160
every time I saw people trying this, it always turned into them actually advocating for a

26:37.160 --> 26:45.160
Catholic or Protestant or some Orthodox even read on religion. If you actually make it into

26:45.160 --> 26:49.640
something advocating for a particular view on religion, then it crosses into the establishment

26:49.640 --> 26:54.360
clause side. Americans haven't figured out a way to actually teach it, so it's probably better that

26:54.360 --> 27:00.200
you learn outside of a public school class. Do you think it's possible to teach religion

27:02.440 --> 27:09.720
from world religions kind of course without disrespecting the religions?

27:09.720 --> 27:12.200
I think the answer is it depends on from whose perspective.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.560
Well, the practitioners say you're an Orthodox follower of a particular religion.

27:17.640 --> 27:25.000
Yeah. Is it possible to not piss you off in teaching all the major religions of the world?

27:25.000 --> 27:29.400
For some people, the bottom line is you have to teach it as true.

27:32.600 --> 27:37.640
Under those conditions, then the answer is no, you can't teach it without offending someone,

27:37.640 --> 27:41.640
at least. Can't you say these people believe it's true? Can you reform it?

27:41.640 --> 27:46.760
So you have to walk on eggshells, essentially. You can try really hard and you will still

27:46.760 --> 27:51.480
make some people angry, but serious people will be like, oh no, you actually tried to be fair

27:51.480 --> 27:58.840
to the beliefs here. I try to be respectful as much as I can about a lot of this. I still find

27:58.840 --> 28:08.600
myself much more drawn to both Buddhism and Stoicism. Where do I go? Okay. One interesting

28:08.600 --> 28:15.160
thing to get back to college campuses is FIRE keeps the college free speech rankings at rankings.thefire.org.

28:16.760 --> 28:17.880
I'm very proud of them.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.800
I highly recommend because forget even just the ranking, you get to learn a lot about the

28:21.800 --> 28:26.120
universities from this entirely different perspective than people are used to when they

28:26.120 --> 28:31.640
go to pick whatever university they want to go to. It just gives another perspective on the whole

28:31.640 --> 28:36.440
thing. And it gives quotes from people that are students there and so on about their experiences.

28:38.440 --> 28:43.480
Maybe you could speak to the various measures here before we talk about who is in the top five and

28:43.480 --> 28:50.120
who is in the bottom five. What are the different parameters that contribute to the evaluation?

28:50.120 --> 28:54.920
So people have been asking me since day one to do a ranking of schools according to freedom of

28:54.920 --> 29:03.160
speech. And even though we had the best database in existence of campus speech codes, policies

29:03.160 --> 29:07.800
that universities have that violate First Amendment or First Amendment norms, we also have the best

29:07.800 --> 29:14.840
database of what we call the disinvitation database. It's better named the deplatforming

29:14.840 --> 29:20.360
database, which is what we're going to call it. And these are all cases where somebody was invited

29:20.360 --> 29:25.560
as a speaker to campus and then were disinvited. Disinvited or deplatforming also includes

29:25.560 --> 29:35.000
shouting down. So they showed up and they couldn't really speak. Yeah, exactly. And so having that,

29:35.080 --> 29:39.160
what we really needed in order to have some serious social science to really make a

29:39.160 --> 29:45.240
serious argument about what the ranking was, was to be able to one, get a better sense of

29:45.240 --> 29:51.000
how many professors were actually getting punished during this time. And then the biggest

29:51.000 --> 29:57.080
missing element was to be able to ask students directly what the environment was like on that

29:57.080 --> 30:01.320
campus for freedom of speech. Are you comfortable disagreeing with each other? Are you comfortable

30:01.320 --> 30:07.240
disagreeing with your professors? Do you think violence is acceptable in response to a speaker?

30:07.240 --> 30:13.560
Do you think shouting down is okay? Do you think blocking people's access to a speaker is okay?

30:14.680 --> 30:20.760
And once we were able to get all those elements together, we first did a test run, I think in

30:20.760 --> 30:26.680
2019, about 50. And we've been doing it for four years now, always trying to make the methodology

30:26.680 --> 30:31.640
more and more precise to better reflect the actual environment at particular schools.

30:32.520 --> 30:36.680
And this year, the number one school was Michigan Technological University, which was a

30:37.400 --> 30:43.800
nice surprise. The number two school was actually Auburn University, which was nice to see.

30:44.520 --> 30:49.320
In the top 10, the most well-known prestigious school is actually UVA, which did really well

30:49.320 --> 30:54.360
this year. University of Chicago was not happy that they weren't number one, but University of

30:54.440 --> 30:59.960
Chicago was 13. And they had been number one or in the top three for years prior to that.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.840
Really? So can you explain, it's almost surprising, is it because of

31:03.560 --> 31:07.080
like the really strong economics departments and things like this, or why?

31:07.080 --> 31:12.360
They had a case involving a student, they wouldn't recognize a chapter of Turning Point USA.

31:12.360 --> 31:18.760
And they made a very classic argument, and classic in the bad way, that we hear at campuses across

31:18.760 --> 31:23.400
the country, oh, we have a campus for Republicans, so we don't need this additional conservative

31:23.400 --> 31:28.920
group. And we're like, no, I'm sorry. We've seen dozens and dozens, if not hundreds of attempts to

31:28.920 --> 31:37.160
get this one particular conservative student group, derecognized or not recognized. And so

31:37.160 --> 31:44.040
we told them, listen, we told them at fire that we consider this serious, and they wouldn't

31:44.040 --> 31:50.760
recognize the group. So that's a point down in our ranking, and it was enough to knock them from,

31:50.760 --> 31:55.800
they probably would have been number two in the rankings. But now they're 13 out of 248.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.880
They're still one of the best schools in the country. I have no problem saying that.

31:59.880 --> 32:10.360
The school that did not do so well at a negative 10.69, negative 10.69, and we rounded up to zero,

32:10.360 --> 32:15.240
was Harvard. And Harvard has been not very happy with that result.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.800
The only school to receive the abysmal ranking.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.680
Yeah. Oh, Harvard.

32:20.680 --> 32:23.560
Oh, Harvard. And there are a couple of people who have actually been really,

32:23.560 --> 32:29.080
I think, making a mistake by getting very Harvard sounding by being like, I've had

32:29.080 --> 32:35.160
statisticians look at this, and they think your methodology is a joke. And this case wasn't that

32:35.160 --> 32:40.840
important. One of the arguments against one of the scholars that we counted against them for

32:41.800 --> 32:46.600
punishing was that that wasn't a very famous or influential scholar. And I'm kind of like,

32:47.240 --> 32:54.360
so your argument seems to be snobbery. Essentially, you're not understanding our

32:54.360 --> 32:59.560
methodology for one thing. And then you're saying that actually that scholar wasn't important enough

32:59.560 --> 33:10.520
to count. And by the way, Harvard, by the way, Harvard, even if we took all of your arguments

33:10.520 --> 33:15.960
as true, even if we decided to get rid of those two professors, you would still be

33:15.960 --> 33:20.760
in negative numbers. You would still be dead last. You would still be after Georgetown and Penn.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.080
And neither of those schools are good for freedom of speech.

33:23.080 --> 33:26.360
I should say the bottom five is the University of Pennsylvania,

33:26.360 --> 33:30.760
like you said, Penn, the University of South Carolina, Georgetown University,

33:30.760 --> 33:36.440
and Fordham University. All very well earned. They have so many bad cases at all of those schools.

33:36.440 --> 33:40.840
What's the best way to find yourself in the bottom five if you're a university?

33:40.840 --> 33:43.480
What's the fastest way to that negative, to that zero?

33:43.480 --> 33:51.400
A lot of deplatforming. When we looked at the bottom five, 81% of attempts to get speakers

33:51.400 --> 33:56.200
deplatformed were successful at the bottom five. There were a couple of schools, I think Penn

33:56.200 --> 34:03.160
included, where every single attempt, every time a student group objected to that speaker coming,

34:03.160 --> 34:08.440
they canceled the speech. And I think Georgetown was 100% success rate. I think Penn had 100%

34:09.400 --> 34:13.000
success rate. I think Harvard did stand up for a couple, but mostly

34:13.800 --> 34:17.960
people got deplatformed there as well. So how do you push back on deplatforming?

34:17.960 --> 34:23.720
Well, who would do it? Is it other students? Is it faculty? Is it the administration? What's

34:23.720 --> 34:32.280
the dynamics of pushing back of basically, because I imagine some of it is culture,

34:32.920 --> 34:36.920
but imagine every university has a bunch of students who will protest basically every

34:36.920 --> 34:39.960
speaker. And it's a question of how you respond to that protest.

34:39.960 --> 34:48.440
Well, here's the dirty little secret about the big change in 2014. Me and Haidt have been very

34:48.440 --> 34:53.640
clear that the big change that we saw on campus was that for most of my career, students were great

34:54.280 --> 34:58.680
on freedom of speech. They were the best constituency for free speech, absolutely

34:58.680 --> 35:05.880
unambiguously until about 2013, 2014. And it was only in 2014 where we had this very kind of sad

35:05.880 --> 35:09.480
for us experience where suddenly students were the ones advocating for deplatforming

35:10.040 --> 35:14.360
and new speech codes, kind of in a similar way that they had been doing in say like the

35:14.360 --> 35:21.160
mid-80s, for example. But here's the dirty little secret. It's not just the students. It's students

35:21.160 --> 35:27.240
and administrators, sometimes only a handful of them though, working together to create some of

35:27.240 --> 35:33.080
these problems. And this was exactly what happened at Stanford when Kyle Duncan, a Fifth Circuit judge

35:33.080 --> 35:37.560
tried to speak at my alma mater and a fifth of the class showed up to shout him down.

35:38.520 --> 35:45.560
It was a real showing of what was going on that 10 minutes into the shout down of a Fifth Circuit

35:45.560 --> 35:49.400
judge, and I keep on emphasizing that because I'm a constitutional lawyer, Fifth Circuit judges are

35:49.400 --> 35:55.080
big deals. They're one level below the Supreme Court. About a fifth of the school shows up to

35:55.080 --> 36:01.400
shout him down. After 10 minutes of shouting him down, a DEI administrator gets up with a prepared

36:01.400 --> 36:07.400
speech that she's written that's a seven-minute long speech where she talks about free speech,

36:07.400 --> 36:12.840
maybe the juice isn't worth the squeeze. And we were at this law school where people could learn

36:12.840 --> 36:18.360
to challenge these norms. So it's clear that there was coordination among some of these

36:18.360 --> 36:22.840
administrators. And from talking to students there, they were in meetings, extensive meetings for a

36:22.840 --> 36:29.480
long time. They show up, do a shout down. Then they take an additional seven minutes to lecture

36:29.480 --> 36:37.400
the speaker on the juice of free speech not being worth the squeeze. And then for the rest of it,

36:37.400 --> 36:45.880
it's just constant heckling after she leaves. Something very similar happened a number of times

36:45.880 --> 36:51.240
at Yale where it was very clearly administrators were helping along with a lot of these disruptions.

36:51.240 --> 36:56.920
So I think every time there is a shout down at a university, the investigation should be,

36:57.560 --> 37:04.920
first and foremost, did administrators help create this problem? Did they do anything to stop it?

37:04.920 --> 37:08.520
Because I think a lot of what's really going on here is the hyper-bureaucratization of

37:08.520 --> 37:14.040
universities with a lot more ideological people who think of their primary job as basically

37:14.040 --> 37:21.800
policing speech more or less. They're encouraging students who have opinions they like to do

37:21.800 --> 37:29.080
shout downs. And that's why they really need to investigate this. And it is at Stanford,

37:29.080 --> 37:33.720
the administrator who gave the prepared remarks about the juice not being worth the squeeze,

37:33.720 --> 37:38.520
she has not been invited back to Stanford. But she's one of the only examples I can think of

37:38.520 --> 37:42.760
when these things happen a lot, where an administrator clearly facilitated something that

37:43.320 --> 37:48.360
was a shout down or deplatforming or resulted in a professor getting fired or resulted in a student

37:48.360 --> 37:54.680
getting expelled, where the administrator has got off scot-free or probably in some cases even

37:54.680 --> 38:00.280
gotten a promotion. And so a small number of administrators, maybe even a single administrator

38:01.000 --> 38:05.720
could participate in the encouraging and the organization and thereby empower the whole

38:05.720 --> 38:09.480
process. And that's something I've seen throughout my entire career. And the only thing is kind of

38:09.480 --> 38:12.840
hard to catch this sort of in the act, so to speak. And that's one of the reasons why it's

38:12.840 --> 38:19.960
helpful for people to know about this, because it was this amazing case. This was at University

38:19.960 --> 38:26.280
of Washington. And we actually featured this in a documentary made in 2015, that came out in 2015,

38:26.280 --> 38:31.800
2016, called Can We Take a Joke? And this was when we started noticing something was changing on

38:31.800 --> 38:36.200
campus. We also heard that comedians were saying that they couldn't use their good humor anymore.

38:36.200 --> 38:40.520
This was right around the time that Jerry Seinfeld and Chris Rock said that they couldn't,

38:40.520 --> 38:46.520
they didn't want to play on campuses because they couldn't be funny. But we featured a case

38:46.520 --> 38:51.480
of a comedian who wanted to do a musical called The Passion of the Musical, making fun of The

38:51.480 --> 38:56.600
Passion of the Christ, with the stated goal of offending everyone, every group equally.

38:56.600 --> 39:04.920
It was very much a South Park mission. And it's an unusual case because we actually got documentation

39:04.920 --> 39:10.840
of administrators buying tickets for angry students and holding an event where they

39:11.880 --> 39:17.560
trained them to jump up in the middle of it and shout, I'm offended. They bought them tickets,

39:17.560 --> 39:23.640
they sent them to this thing with the goal of shouting it down. Now, unsurprisingly,

39:23.640 --> 39:29.240
when you send an angry group of students to shut down a play, it's not going to end at just,

39:29.800 --> 39:37.240
I'm offended. And it got heated. There were death threats being thrown. And then the Pullman

39:37.240 --> 39:43.720
Washington police told Chris Lee, the guy who made the play, that they wouldn't actually protect him.

39:43.720 --> 39:48.600
Now, it's not every day you're going to have that kind of hard evidence of actually seeing

39:48.600 --> 39:54.200
the administrators be so brazen that they recorded the fact that they bought them tickets and sent

39:54.200 --> 40:01.480
them. But I think a lot of that stuff is going on. And I think it's a good excuse to cut down on

40:01.480 --> 40:04.840
one of the big problems in higher education today, which is hyper-bureaucratization.

40:05.400 --> 40:09.400
In your experience, is there a distinction between administrators and faculty in terms of

40:10.200 --> 40:16.280
perpetrators of these kinds of things? So if we got rid of all, like Harvey's talked about

40:17.080 --> 40:20.840
getting rid of a large percentage of the administration, does that help fix the

40:20.840 --> 40:27.560
problem? Or is the faculty also small percent of the faculty also part of the encouraging

40:27.560 --> 40:32.840
and the organization of these kinds of cancel? Yeah. And that's something that has been profoundly

40:32.840 --> 40:38.360
disappointing, is that when you look at the huge uptick in attempts to get professors fired that

40:38.360 --> 40:44.600
we've seen over the last 10 years, and actually over the last 22 years, as far back as our records

40:44.600 --> 40:51.640
go, at first they're overwhelmingly led by administrators, attempts to get professors

40:51.640 --> 40:58.120
punished. And that was most, I'd say that was my career up until 2013 was fighting back at

40:58.120 --> 41:03.720
administrative excesses. Then you start having the problem in 2014 of students trying to get

41:03.720 --> 41:10.040
people canceled. And that really accelerated in 2017. And the number, so one thing that makes it

41:10.040 --> 41:15.240
easier to document are the petitions to get professors fired or punished, and how

41:15.240 --> 41:20.280
disproportionately that those actually do come from students. But another big uptick has been

41:20.280 --> 41:25.000
fellow professors demanding that their fellow professors get punished. And that to me-

41:25.000 --> 41:26.200
It makes me really sad.

41:26.200 --> 41:32.440
It's kind of shameful. You shouldn't be proud of signing the petition to get your fellow professor.

41:32.440 --> 41:39.960
And what's even more shameful is that we get, this has almost become a cliche within fire.

41:40.520 --> 41:45.320
When someone is facing one of these cancellation campaigns with a professor, I would get letters

41:45.320 --> 41:50.760
from some of my friends saying, I am so sorry this has happened to you. And these were the

41:50.760 --> 41:54.040
same people who publicly signed the petition to get them fired.

41:54.680 --> 42:02.840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Integrity. Integrity is an important thing in this world. And I think

42:03.400 --> 42:10.040
some of it, I'm so surprised people don't stand up more for this because there's so

42:10.040 --> 42:16.120
much hunger for it. And if you have the guts as a faculty or an administrator to really stand up

42:18.520 --> 42:27.800
with eloquence, with rigor, with integrity, I feel like it's impossible for anyone to do anything

42:27.800 --> 42:34.120
because there's such a hunger. It's so refreshing. I think everybody agrees that

42:34.120 --> 42:36.200
freedom of speech is a good thing.

42:36.200 --> 42:36.840
Oh, I don't-

42:37.800 --> 42:38.520
Okay, sorry, sorry.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.080
I don't agree.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.880
The majority of people, even at the universities, that there's a hunger, but it's almost like

42:44.840 --> 42:49.800
this kind of nervousness around it because there's a small number of loud voices.

42:49.800 --> 42:54.920
They're doing the shouting. So, I mean, again, that's where great leadership comes in. And so,

42:55.560 --> 43:00.840
presidents of universities should probably be making clear declarations of like,

43:00.840 --> 43:05.080
this is a place where we value the freedom of expression.

43:05.720 --> 43:11.320
And this was all throughout my career, a university president who puts their foot down

43:11.320 --> 43:17.560
early and says, nope, we are not entertaining firing this professor. We are not expelling

43:17.560 --> 43:22.840
this student. It ends the issue often very fast. Although sometimes, and this is where

43:22.840 --> 43:26.840
you can really tell the administrative involvement, students will do things like

43:26.840 --> 43:32.040
take over the president's office. And then that takeover will be catered by the university.

43:32.040 --> 43:36.680
People will point this out sometimes as being kind of like, oh, it's clearly like my friend,

43:36.680 --> 43:44.440
Sam Abrams, when they tried to get him fired at Sarah Lawrence College. And that was one of the

43:44.440 --> 43:50.040
times that it was used as kind of like, oh, this was hostile to the university because the students

43:50.040 --> 43:53.800
took over the president's office. And I'm like, no, they let them take over the president's office.

43:53.800 --> 43:58.120
And I don't know if that was one of the cases in which the takeover was catered. But if there

43:58.120 --> 44:03.000
was ever sort of like a sign that's kind of like, yes, this is actually really quite friendly.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.760
Well, in some sense, like protesting and having really strong opinions, even like

44:07.400 --> 44:11.480
ridiculous, crazy, wild opinions is a good thing. It's just it shouldn't lead to actual

44:12.280 --> 44:16.040
firing or deplatforming of people. Like, it's good to protest. It's just not

44:16.040 --> 44:19.880
good for the university to support that and take action based on it.

44:19.880 --> 44:25.160
And this is one of those like tensions in First Amendment that actually I think has a pretty easy

44:25.160 --> 44:32.920
release, essentially. You absolutely have the right to devote your life to ending freedom of

44:32.920 --> 44:39.400
speech and ridiculing as a concept. And there are people who really can come off as very

44:39.400 --> 44:44.840
contemptible about even the philosophy of freedom of speech. And we will defend your right to do that.

44:44.920 --> 44:50.120
We will also disagree with you. And if you try to get a professor fired, we will be on the other

44:50.120 --> 44:55.960
side of that. Now, I think you had Randy Kennedy, who I really I love him. I think he's a great guy.

44:55.960 --> 45:02.920
But he's he criticized us for our deplatforming database as saying this is saying that students

45:02.920 --> 45:09.800
can't protest speakers. I'm like, OK, that's silly. We fire as an organization have defended

45:09.800 --> 45:13.800
the right to protest all the time. We are constantly defending the rights of the rights

45:13.800 --> 45:19.640
of protesters, not believing the protesters have the right to say this would basically that would

45:19.640 --> 45:26.040
be punishing the speakers. We're not calling for punishing the protesters. But what we are saying

45:26.040 --> 45:30.760
is you can't let the protesters win if they're demanding someone be fired for their freedom of

45:30.760 --> 45:39.320
speech. So the line there is between protesters protesting and the university taking action based

45:39.320 --> 45:43.480
in the protest. Yeah, exactly. And of course, shout downs that that's just mob censorship.

45:44.360 --> 45:48.680
And that's something where the university the way that the way you actually you deal with that

45:48.680 --> 45:52.600
tension and First Amendment law is essentially kind of like the one positive duty that the

45:52.600 --> 45:57.240
government has. The first the negative do the thing that is not allowed to do is censor you.

45:58.120 --> 46:03.480
But it's positive duty is that if I want to say awful things, or for that matter, great things

46:03.480 --> 46:08.520
that aren't popular in a public park, you can't let the crowd just shout me down.

46:09.240 --> 46:15.800
You can't allow what's called a heckler's veto. That's so interesting, because I feel like that

46:15.800 --> 46:21.160
comes into play on social media. So, you know, there's this whole discussion about censorship

46:21.160 --> 46:28.760
and freedom of speech. But to me, the the carrot question is almost more interesting once the

46:28.760 --> 46:33.640
freedom of speech is established is how do you incentivize high quality debate and disagreement?

46:33.640 --> 46:37.560
I'm thinking a lot about that. And that's one of the things we talk about in canceling the American

46:37.560 --> 46:45.080
mind is arguing towards truth. And that cancel culture is cruel. It's merciless. It's anti

46:45.080 --> 46:49.240
intellectual, but it also will never get you anywhere in your truth. And you are going to

46:49.240 --> 46:55.240
waste so much time destroying your opponents in something that can actually never get you to truth

46:55.240 --> 46:58.760
through the process, of course, of you never actually get directly at truth, you just chip

46:58.760 --> 47:04.280
away at falsity. Yeah. But everybody having a megaphone on the internet with anonymity,

47:05.320 --> 47:14.120
it seems like it's better than censorship. But it feels like there's incentives on top of that,

47:14.680 --> 47:21.800
you can construct to get to incentivize better discourse. Yeah, it's like, to incentivize

47:21.800 --> 47:26.840
somebody who puts a huge amount of effort to make even the most ridiculous arguments, but basically,

47:27.400 --> 47:33.560
ones that don't include any of the things you highlight in terms of all the rhetorical tricks

47:33.560 --> 47:38.680
to shut down conversations, just make really good arguments for whatever it doesn't matter

47:38.680 --> 47:44.120
if it's communism for fascism, whatever the heck you want to say, but do it with scale,

47:44.120 --> 47:50.280
with historical context, with with steel man on the other side, all those kind of elements.

47:50.280 --> 47:56.600
We try to make three major points in the book. One is just simply cancel culture is real. It's

47:56.600 --> 48:02.760
a historic era, and it's on a historic scale. The second one is you should think of cancel culture

48:02.760 --> 48:11.880
as part of a rhetorical as a larger lazy rhetorical approach to what we refer to as

48:11.880 --> 48:15.800
winning arguments without winning arguments. And we mean that in two senses without having

48:15.800 --> 48:20.920
winning arguments or have actually having won arguments. And we talk about all the different,

48:20.920 --> 48:25.880
what we call rhetorical fortresses that both the left and the right have that prevent you from

48:25.880 --> 48:32.760
that allow you to just dismiss the person or dodge the argument without actually ever getting to the

48:32.760 --> 48:36.760
substance of the argument. Third part is just, you know, how do we fix it? But the rhetorical

48:36.760 --> 48:41.480
fortress stuff is actually something I've been I'm very passionate about because it interferes

48:41.480 --> 48:47.400
with our ability to get at truth and it wastes time. And frankly, it also kind of since cancel

48:47.400 --> 48:52.120
culture is part of that rhetorical tactic, it can also ruin lives. It would actually be really fun

48:52.120 --> 48:56.680
to talk about this particular aspect of the book. And I highly recommend if you're listening to this

48:56.680 --> 49:03.560
go pre order the book now. When does it come out? October 17. Okay, the canceling of the American

49:03.560 --> 49:11.640
mind. Okay, so in in the book, you also have a list of cheap rhetorical tactics that both the

49:11.640 --> 49:19.240
left and the right use. And then you have a list of tactics that the left uses and the right uses.

49:19.240 --> 49:24.120
Yeah, there's the rhetorical, the perfect rhetorical fortress that the left uses, and the

49:24.120 --> 49:29.560
efficient rhetorical fortress that the right uses. Yeah, first one is what about ism. Yeah,

49:29.560 --> 49:33.560
maybe we can go through a few of them that capture your heart in this particular moment

49:33.560 --> 49:41.160
as we talk about it. And if if you can describe examples of it, or if there's aspects of it that

49:41.160 --> 49:46.680
you see there, especially effective, effective. So what about ism is defending against criticism

49:46.680 --> 49:52.920
of your side by bringing up the other side's alleged wrongdoing. I want to make little cards

49:52.920 --> 49:59.240
of these of all of these tactics and start using them on x all the time, because they are so

49:59.240 --> 50:03.720
commonly deployed. And what about ism I put first for a reason, you know, it'd be an interesting

50:03.720 --> 50:09.400
idea to actually integrate that into Twitter slash x, where people you know, instead of clicking

50:09.400 --> 50:16.520
heart, they can click which of the which of the rhetorical tactics this is. And then because

50:16.520 --> 50:21.000
you know, there's actually community notes. I don't know if you've seen on x there you people

50:21.000 --> 50:27.080
can contribute notes. And it's quite fascinating. It works really, really well. But to give it a

50:27.080 --> 50:31.320
little more structure. Yeah, that's a really interesting method, actually. Yeah, I actually

50:31.320 --> 50:36.520
when I was thinking about ways that x could be used to argue towards truth, I wouldn't want to

50:36.520 --> 50:42.040
have it so that, you know, everybody would be bound to that. But I think that I imagine being

50:42.040 --> 50:47.720
like a stream within x that was truth focused, that agrees to some additional additional rules

50:47.720 --> 50:53.320
on how they would argue. Man, I would love that. Where like there's in terms of streams that

50:53.320 --> 50:59.560
intersect and can be separated. The shit talking one where people just enjoy talking shit. Okay,

50:59.560 --> 51:05.400
go for it. And then there's like truth. And then, I mean, they're like, then there's humor.

51:06.360 --> 51:12.040
Then there's like good vibes. Like, you know, I'm not like somebody who absolutely needs good vibes

51:12.040 --> 51:18.760
all the time. But sometimes it's nice to have it's nice to just log in and not have to see like the

51:18.760 --> 51:23.320
drama, the fighting, the bickering, the, the cancellations, the moms, all of this, it's good

51:23.320 --> 51:30.840
to just see. That's why I go to Reddit, our or like, what are the cute animals ones where there's

51:30.840 --> 51:34.840
cute puppies and kittens. And it's like, I just want to see Ryan Reynolds singing with Will Ferrell.

51:34.840 --> 51:40.440
I mean, sometimes that's all I need that in my heart. Yeah, not all the time, just a little bit.

51:40.440 --> 51:46.280
And right back to the battle for truth. Okay, so what about ism? What about ism? Yeah, that's

51:46.280 --> 51:50.920
everywhere. When you look at it, when you look at Twitter, when you look at social media in general,

51:51.720 --> 51:57.480
and the first like what we call the obstacle course is basically time tested, old fashioned,

51:57.480 --> 52:02.840
you know, argumentative dodges that everybody uses. And what about ism is just bringing up

52:02.840 --> 52:07.720
something, you know, like someone makes an argument like Biden is corrupt. And then someone

52:07.720 --> 52:13.960
says, well, Trump was worse, you know, like, and that's not an illegitimate, you know, argument to

52:13.960 --> 52:18.360
make back. But it does, it seems to happen every time someone makes an assertion, someone just

52:18.360 --> 52:21.960
points out some other thing that was going on. And it can get increasingly attenuated from

52:22.520 --> 52:28.680
what you're actually trying to argue. And you see this all the time on social media. And it's kind

52:28.680 --> 52:34.040
of, you know, I was a big fan of Jon Stewart's Daily Show, but an awful lot of what the humor was

52:34.040 --> 52:38.120
and what the tactic was for arguing was this thing over here. It's like, oh, I'm making this argument

52:38.120 --> 52:42.840
about this important problem. Oh, actually, you know, there's this other problem over here that

52:42.840 --> 52:50.040
I'm more concerned about. And, you know, let's pick on the right here. So January 6, you know,

52:50.040 --> 52:57.400
watching everybody arguing about CHOP, you know, like the occupied part of Seattle or the occupied

52:57.400 --> 53:03.800
part of Portland, and basically trying to like, oh, you're bringing up the riot in January 6.

53:03.800 --> 53:07.880
And by the way, I live on Capitol Hill. So believe me, I was very aware of like how

53:07.880 --> 53:13.960
scary and bad it was. You know, like, just my dad grew up in Yugoslavia, and that was a night where

53:13.960 --> 53:17.640
we all ate dinner in the basement, because I'm like, oh, when the shit goes down, eat in the

53:17.640 --> 53:24.440
basement. It was genuinely scary. And people would try to deflect from January 6 being serious by

53:24.440 --> 53:29.240
actually making the argument that, oh, well, there are crazy, horrible things happening in

53:29.240 --> 53:35.560
all over the country, you know, riots that came from some of the social justice protests.

53:35.560 --> 53:40.600
And of course, the answer is, you can be concerned about both of these things and find them both

53:40.600 --> 53:45.640
problems. But, you know, if I'm arguing about CHOP, you know, someone bringing up January 6

53:45.640 --> 53:51.240
isn't super relevant to it. Or if I'm arguing about January 6, someone bringing up the riots

53:51.240 --> 53:57.240
in 2020, isn't that helpful? We took a long dark journey from what aboutism. Yeah. And related to

53:57.240 --> 54:03.800
that is straw manning and steel manning. So misrepresenting the perspective of the

54:03.800 --> 54:11.240
opposing perspective. And this is something also, I guess, is very prevalent. And it's difficult to

54:11.240 --> 54:16.200
do the reverse of that, which is steel manning. It requires empathy, it requires eloquence,

54:16.200 --> 54:21.800
it requires understanding, actually doing the research and understanding the alternative

54:21.800 --> 54:26.920
perspective. My wonderful employee, Angel Anduardo, has something that he calls star manning.

54:27.480 --> 54:32.760
And I find myself doing this a lot. It's nice to have, you know, two immigrant parents, because I

54:32.760 --> 54:41.240
remember being in San Francisco, you know, in the weird kind of like ACLU slash Burning Man kind of

54:41.240 --> 54:49.160
cohort. And having a friend there who was an artist who would talk about hating Kansas. And that was

54:49.160 --> 54:54.840
his metaphor for middle America is what he meant by it. And but he was kind of proud of the fact

54:54.840 --> 55:00.520
that he hated Kansas. And I'm like, you got to understand, I still see all of you a little bit

55:00.520 --> 55:07.800
as foreigners. And think about like change the name of Kansas to Croatia, you know, change the

55:07.800 --> 55:14.520
name of Kansas to some, that's what it sounds like to me. And the star manning idea, which I like,

55:14.520 --> 55:19.640
is the idea being like, so you're saying that you really hate your dominant religious minority.

55:20.440 --> 55:24.920
And that's when you start actually detaching yourself a little bit from it. How typical.

55:25.880 --> 55:31.400
America is exceptional a number of ways. But some of our dynamics are incredibly typical. It's one

55:31.400 --> 55:35.320
of the reasons why like, when people start reading Thomas Sowell, for example, they start getting

55:35.320 --> 55:40.120
hooked. Because one of the things he does, is he does comparative analysis of countries problems

55:40.120 --> 55:44.120
and points out that some of these things that we think are just unique to the United States exist in,

55:45.560 --> 55:50.120
you know, 75% of the rest of the countries in the world. Francis Fukuyama's, the book that

55:50.120 --> 55:54.440
I'm reading right now, Origins of the Political Order, actually does this wonderful job of

55:54.440 --> 55:58.200
pointing out how we're not special in a variety of ways. This is actually something that's very

55:58.200 --> 56:07.240
much on my mind. And Fukuyama, of course, it's a great book. It's not, it's stilted a little

56:07.240 --> 56:11.800
bit in its writing, because his term for one of the things he's concerned about what destroys

56:11.800 --> 56:22.200
societies is repatrimonialization, which is the reversion to societies in which you favor your

56:22.200 --> 56:29.720
family and friends. And I actually think a lot of what I'm seeing in sort of, in the United States,

56:29.720 --> 56:33.800
it makes me worried that we might be going through a little bit of a process of repatrimonialization.

56:33.800 --> 56:38.360
And I think that's one of the reasons why people are so angry. I think having, I think the prospect

56:38.360 --> 56:44.120
that we, you know, we very, we very nearly seem to have an election that was going to be, you know,

56:44.120 --> 56:49.720
Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton. It's like, are we a dynastic country now? Is that what's kind of

56:49.720 --> 56:53.160
happening? But also it's one of the reasons why people are getting so angry about the,

56:53.160 --> 56:58.040
about legacy admissions, about like how much, you know, certain families seem to be able to keep

56:58.760 --> 57:03.240
their people in the upper classes of the United States perpetually. And believe me,

57:03.240 --> 57:07.320
like I was, we were poor when I was a kid and I went to, and I got to go to,

57:07.320 --> 57:14.840
I got to go to one of the fancies. I got to go to Stanford. And I got to see how people,

57:15.080 --> 57:20.680
they treat you differently in a way that's almost insulting. Like basically like suddenly to a

57:20.680 --> 57:27.400
certain kind of person, I was a legitimate person. And I look at how much America relies on Harvard,

57:27.400 --> 57:34.520
on Yale to produce its, I'm going to use a very Marxist sounding term, ruling class. And that's

57:34.520 --> 57:38.680
one of the reasons why you have to be particularly worried about what goes on at these elite

57:38.680 --> 57:43.800
colleges. And these elite colleges with the exception of the University of Chicago and UVA

57:44.120 --> 57:50.520
and UVA do really badly regarding freedom of speech. And that has all sorts of problems.

57:52.520 --> 57:56.120
It doesn't bode well for the future of the protection of freedom of speech for the rest

57:56.120 --> 58:02.440
of the society. So can you also empathize there with the folks who voted for Donald Trump?

58:04.200 --> 58:08.680
Because as precisely that as a resistance to this kind of

58:09.400 --> 58:19.880
a momentum of the ruling class, this royalty that passes on the rule from generation to generation.

58:19.880 --> 58:25.640
I try really hard to empathize with to a degree everybody and try to really see where they're

58:25.640 --> 58:33.960
coming from. And the anger on the right, I get it. I mean, like I feel like the book,

58:34.920 --> 58:40.680
so Coddling the American Mind was a book that could be sort of a crowd pleaser to a degree,

58:40.680 --> 58:47.480
partially because we really meant what we said in the subtitle that these are good intentions

58:47.480 --> 58:52.120
and bad ideas that are hurting people. And if you understand it and read the book,

58:52.120 --> 58:57.720
you can say it's like, okay, this isn't anybody being malicious, you know, this is people trying

58:57.720 --> 59:02.200
to protect their kids. They're just doing it in a way that actually can actually lead to greater

59:02.200 --> 59:08.600
anxiety, depression, and strangely, eventually pose a threat to freedom of speech. But in this

59:08.600 --> 59:14.040
one, we can't be quiet. Me and my, oh, I haven't even mentioned my brilliant co-author, Ricky Schlott,

59:14.040 --> 59:20.600
a 23-year-old genius. She's amazing. I started working with her when she was 20, who's my

59:20.600 --> 59:24.440
co-author on this book. So when I'm saying we, I'm talking about me and Ricky.

59:24.440 --> 59:25.800
She's a libertarian.

59:25.800 --> 59:26.920
Libertarian journalist.

59:26.920 --> 59:29.400
And a journalist. Yeah, a brilliant mind.

59:29.960 --> 59:34.760
Yeah, but we can't actually write this in a way that's too kind because cancelers aren't kind.

59:35.320 --> 59:40.120
There's a cruelty and a mercilessness about it. I mean, I started getting really depressed

59:40.120 --> 59:43.320
this past year when I was writing it, and I didn't even want to tell my staff why I was

59:43.320 --> 59:47.320
getting so anxious and depressed. It's partially because I'm talking about people who will,

59:48.360 --> 59:52.920
you know, in some of the cases we're talking about, go to your house, target your kids.

59:53.800 --> 01:00:01.800
So that's a long-winded way of saying the, I kind of can get what sort of drives the right

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:05.560
nuts to a degree in this. I feel like they're constantly feeling like they're being gas-lit.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:14.520
Elite education is really insulting to the working class. Like part of the ideology that

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.720
is dominant right now kind of treats almost 70% of the American public like they're,

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:23.800
we developed this a little bit in the perfect rhetorical fortress, like they're

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:30.360
to some way illegitimate and not worthy of respect or compassion.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.640
Yeah, the general elitism that radiates,

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.200
self-fueling elitism that radiates from the people that go to these institutions.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.400
And what's funny is the elitism has been repackaged as a kind of,

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:52.760
it masquerades as kind of infinite compassion, that essentially it's based in a sort of a very,

01:00:53.720 --> 01:01:00.200
to be frank, overly simple ideology and an oversimply, a simple explanation of the world

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.480
and breaking people into groups and judging people on how oppressed they are on their,

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:11.960
on the intersection of their various identities. And it came to that, I think, initially with,

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:19.560
with an, an appeal from a compassionate core, but it gets used in a way that is,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:26.600
can be very cruel, very dismissive, compassionless, and allows you to not take seriously

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.000
most of your fellow human beings.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.360
It's really weird how that happened. Maybe you can explore why a thing that has,

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.960
kind of sounds good at first, can be, can create,

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:46.760
can become such a cruel weapon of canceling and hurting people and ignoring people.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.120
I mean, this is what you describe with a perfect rhetorical fortress,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.080
which is a set of questions. Maybe you can elaborate on what the perfect rhetorical fortress is.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:01.720
Yeah, so the perfect rhetorical fortress is the way that's been developed on the left

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.160
to not ever get to someone's actual argument. I want to make a chart, like a flow chart of

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.320
this about like, here's the argument and here is this perfect fortress that will deflect you

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:16.440
every time from getting the argument. And I started to notice this certainly when I,

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:20.280
when I was in law school, that there were lots of different ways you could dismiss people.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:26.520
And perfect rhetorical fortress, step one, and I can attest to this because I was guilty of this

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:32.280
as well, that you can dismiss people if you can argue that they're conservative. They don't have

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:38.440
to be conservative to be clear. You just have to say that they are. So I never read Thomas Sowell

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.120
because he was a right winger. I didn't read Camille Poglia because I was,

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.480
someone had convinced me she was a right winger. There were lots of authors that,

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:54.120
and when I was in law school, among a lot of very bright people, it really was already

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.360
an intellectual habit that if you could designate something conservative,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.200
then you didn't really have to think about it very much anymore or take it particularly seriously.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:08.520
That's a childish way of arguing, but nonetheless, I engaged in it. It was a common tactic. I even

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:15.240
mentioned in the book, there was a time when a gay activist friend who was, I think, decidedly to

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.960
my left, but nonetheless had that pragmatic experience of actually being an activist,

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.160
said something like, well, just because someone's conservative doesn't mean they're wrong.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:27.720
I remember feeling kind of scandalized at some level, just being like, well, that's kind of,

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.760
isn't that the whole thing when we're saying is that they're just kind of bad people with bad

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:35.160
ideas? You can just throw, oh, that guy's a right winger. You can just throw that.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.480
Boop. Don't have to think about you anymore. Yeah. And then it can, if you're popular enough,

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:47.560
it can be kind of sticky. It's weird because it's effective. That's why it keeps on getting

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:54.680
used to it. Essentially, it should have hit someone's, because I have a great liberal

01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.800
pedigree, everything from working at the ACLU to doing refugee law in Eastern Europe. I was part

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:09.160
of an environmental mentoring program for inner city high school kids in DC. I can defend myself

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.920
as being on the left, but I hate doing that because there's also part of me that's like, okay,

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:23.160
so what? Are you really saying that if you can magically make me argue or convince yourself

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.320
that I'm on the right, that you don't have to listen to me anymore? Again, that's arguing like

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:33.640
children. The reason why this has become so popular is because even among, or maybe especially among

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:38.680
elites that it works so effectively as a perfect weapon that you can use uncritically. If I can

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:43.000
just prove you're on the right, I don't have to think about you. It's no wonder that suddenly

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.840
you start seeing people calling the ACLU right wing and calling the New York Times right wing

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.800
because it's been such an effective way to delegitimize people as thinkers.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.840
Steven Pinker, who's on our board of advisors, he refers to academia as being the left pole

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.880
that essentially it's a position that from that point of view, everything looks as if it's on the

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:16.440
right. Once it becomes a tactic that we accept, and this is one of the reasons why I'm more on

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:23.400
the left, but I think I'm left of center liberal. Ricky is more conservative, libertarian,

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.840
and initially I was like, should I really be writing something with someone who's more on

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.480
the right? I'm like, absolutely I should be. I have to actually live up to what I believe on

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:35.880
this stuff because it's ridiculous that we have this primitive idea that you can dismiss someone

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.720
as soon as you claim, rightly or wrongly, that they're on the right.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.840
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like you were recently called right wing

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:50.120
fire, maybe you by association because of that debate.

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.800
Oh, the LA Times.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.520
The LA Times.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.280
Oh, fun. Let's talk about the LA Times.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.200
So yes, there's an article, there's a debate. I can't wait to watch it because I don't think

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:04.120
it's available yet to watch on video. You have to attend in person. I can't wait to see it.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:09.400
But fire was in part supporting and then LA Times wrote a scathing article about

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:15.160
that everybody in the debate was basically leaning right.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:21.320
Okay. So much to unpack there. Barry Weiss has this great project, The Free Press. I've been

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.760
very impressed. It's covering stories that a lot of the media, right or left, isn't willing to cover.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:36.520
And we hosted a debate with her and we wanted to make it as fun and controversial as possible.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.560
So fire and The Free Press hosted a debate. Did the sexual revolution fail?

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:47.320
So the debate was really exciting, really fun. The side that said the sexual revolution wasn't

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:55.160
a failure that Grimes and Sarah Hader were on. One, it was a nice, meaty, thoughtful night.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.280
And there was a review of it that was just sort of scathing about the whole thing.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.920
And it included a line saying that fire, which claims to believe in free speech,

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:09.480
but only defends viewpoints it agrees with. I can't believe that even made it into the

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:12.440
magazine. Because it's not just calling us, because of course, the implication of course

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.000
is that we're right wing, which we're not. Actually, the staff leans decidedly more to

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:24.040
the left and to the right. But we also defend people all over the spectrum all the time.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.440
That's something that even the most minimal Google search would have solved. So we've been

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.080
giving LA Times some heat on this because it's like, yeah, if you said, in my opinion,

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:39.960
they're right wing, we would have argued back, saying, well, here's the following 50,000 examples

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:45.640
of us not being. But when you actually make the factual claim that we only defend opinions we

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:49.960
agree with, first of all, there's no way for us to agree with opinions because we actually have

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:55.720
a politically diverse staff who won't even agree on which opinions are good and what opinions we

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.720
have. But yeah, at one time when someone did something like this, and they were just being

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:07.880
a little bit flippant about kind of free speech being fine, I did a 70 tweet long thread, just

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.640
being like, hey, do you really think this is fine? I decided not to do that on this particular one.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.960
But the nice thing about it is it demonstrated two parts of the book,

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.600
Canceling the American Mind, if not more. One of them is dismissing someone because they're

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:26.440
conservative, because that was the implication. Don't have to listen to fire because they're

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:32.040
conservative. But the other one is something, a term that I invented specifically for the way

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.960
people argue on Twitter, which is hypocrisy projection. Hi, I'm a person who only cares

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.560
about one side of the political fence, and I think everyone else is a hypocrite. And by the way,

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.360
I haven't done any actual research on this, but I assume everyone else is a hypocrite.

01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:52.760
And you see this happen all the time. And this happens to fire a lot where someone will be like,

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.440
where is fire on this case? And we're like, we are literally quoted in the link you just sent,

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:05.240
but didn't actually read. Or it's like, where's fire on this? Here's our lawsuit about it from

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:15.320
six months ago. So it's a favorite thing. And also, John Stewart, Daily Show, the whataboutism

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:20.760
and the idea that these people must be hypocrites is something that, great as comedy, but as far as

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.240
actually a rhetorical tactic that will get you to truth, just assuming that your opponent or just

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:31.560
accusing your opponent of always being a hypocrite is not a good tactic for truth. But by the way,

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:36.040
it tends to always come from people who aren't actually consistent on free speech themselves.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.120
So that hands the projection, but basically not doing the research about whether the person is

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.400
or isn't a hypocrite and assuming others or a large fraction of others reading it,

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:54.440
will also not do the research. And therefore this kind of statement becomes a kind of truthiness

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.560
without a grounding in actual reality. It breaks down that barrier between what is and isn't true,

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.760
because if the mob says something is true, it takes too much effort to correct it.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:10.600
And there are three ways I want to respond to this, which is just giving example after example

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:16.200
of times where we defended people on both sides of every major issue, basically every major issue,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.120
whether it's Israel-Palestine, whether it's terrorism, whether it's gay marriage,

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:26.120
we have been, abortion, we have defended both sides of that argument. The other part,

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.840
and I call these the orphans of the culture war, I really want to urge the media to start caring

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:37.720
about free speech cases that actually don't have a political valence, that are actually just about

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:44.520
good old fashioned exercise of power against the little guy or little girl or little group on campus

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:49.160
or off campus for that matter. Because these cases happen, a lot of our litigation are just

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:54.200
little people as regular people being told that they can't protest, that they can't hold signs.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.800
And then the last part of the argument that I want people to really get is like, yeah,

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:03.560
and by the way, right wingers get in trouble too. And there are attacks from the left and

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.760
you should take those seriously too. You should care when Republicans get in trouble. You should

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:16.040
care when California has a DEI program that requires this, California Community Colleges

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:23.000
has a DEI program policy that actually requires even chemistry professors to work in different

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:28.600
DEI ideas from intersectionality to anti-racism into their classroom, into their syllabus,

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:35.800
et cetera. This is a gross violation of academic freedom. It is as bad as it is to tell professors

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:40.520
what they can't say, like we fought and defeated in Florida. It's even worse to tell them what

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:46.440
they must say. That's downright totalitarian and we're suing against this. And what I'm saying is

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:52.840
that when you're dismissing someone for just being on the other side of the political fence,

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:58.360
you are also kind of making a claim that none of these cases matter as well.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.800
And I want people to care about censorship when it even is against people they hate.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:14.360
Censorship is censorship. If we can take that tangent briefly with DEI, diversity, equity,

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:20.600
and inclusion, what is the good and what is the harm of such programs?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:27.400
DEI, I know people who are DEI consultants. Actually, I have a dear friend who I love very

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:37.160
much who does DEI. Absolutely decent people. What they want to do is create bonds of understanding,

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.760
friendship, compassion among people who are different. Unfortunately, the research on

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:49.640
what a lot of DEI actually does is often the opposite of that. And I think that it's partially

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:54.520
a problem with some of the ideology that comes from critical race theory, which is a real thing,

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:59.320
by the way, that informs a lot of DEI, that actually makes it something more likely to divide

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.840
than unite. We talk about this in Coddling in the American Mind as the difference between common

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:11.480
humanity identity politics and common enemy identity politics. And I think that I know some

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:17.560
of the people that I know who do DEI, they really want it to be common humanity identity politics,

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:23.000
but some of the actual ideological assumptions that are baked in can actually cause people to

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.360
feel more alienated from each other. Now, when I started at FIRE, my first cases involved 9-11,

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:36.680
and it was bad. Professors were getting targeted, professors were losing their jobs

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.800
for saying insensitive things about 9-11, and both from the right and the left. Actually,

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:48.840
in that case, sometimes a lot more from the right. And it was really bad, and about five

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.800
professors lost their jobs. That's bad. Five professors over a relatively short period of

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:58.360
time being fired for a political opinion, that's something that would get written up

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:04.440
in any previous decades. We're now evaluating how many professors have been targeted for

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:14.440
cancellation between 2014 and middle of this year, July of 2023. We're in well over a thousand

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:20.840
attempts to get professors fired or punished, usually driven by students and administrators,

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:26.680
often driven by professors, unfortunately, as well. About two-thirds of those result in the

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:33.560
professor being punished in some way, everything from having their article removed to suspension,

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:40.600
etc. About one-fifth of those result in professors being fired. Right now, it's

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:46.520
almost 200, it's around 190 professors being fired. I want to give some context here.

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:53.160
The Red Scare is generally considered to have been from 1947 to 1957. It ended, by the way,

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.680
in 1957 when it finally became clear, thanks to the First Amendment, that you couldn't actually

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.040
fire people for their ideologies. Prior to that, a lot of universities thought they could. This guy

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:10.280
is a very doctrinaire communist. It can't be just waited. I'm going to fire them. They thought they

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:15.880
actually could do that. It was only 57 when the law was established. Right now, these are happening

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:21.720
in an environment where freedom of speech, academic freedom are clearly protected at public

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:28.280
colleges in the United States. We're still seeing these kind of numbers. During the Red Scare,

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:32.840
the biggest study that was done of what was going on, I think this came out in like 55,

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:41.640
and the evaluation was that there was about 62 professors fired for being communists and about

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:50.040
90-something professors fired for political views overall. That usually is reported as being about

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:56.760
100. 60, 90, 100, depending on how you look at it. I think the number is actually higher,

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.520
but that's only because of hindsight. What I mean by hindsight is we can look back and we actually

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:10.200
find there were more professors who were fired as time reveals. We're at 190 professors fired,

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.400
and I still have to put up with people saying this isn't even happening. I'm like, in the

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:20.760
nine and a half years of cancel culture, 190 professors fired in the 11 years of the Red Scare,

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:27.480
probably somewhere around 100, maybe probably more. The number is going to keep going up,

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:31.080
but unlike during the Red Scare where people could clearly tell something was happening,

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.600
the craziest thing about cancel culture is I'm still dealing with people who are saying this

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.720
isn't happening at all, and it hasn't been subtle on campus. We know that's a wild undercount,

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:46.600
by the way, because when we surveyed professors, 17% of them said that they had been threatened

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:54.120
with investigation or actually investigated for what they taught said or their research,

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:59.320
and one third of them said that they were told by administrators not to take on

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:04.680
controversial research. Extrapolating that out, that's a huge number. The reason why you're not

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.600
going to hear about a lot of these cases is because there are so many different conformity

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.880
inducing mechanisms in the whole thing. That's one of the reasons why the idea that you'd add

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.800
something like requiring a DEI statement to be hired or to get into a school under the current

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:25.800
environment is so completely nuts. We have had a genuine crisis of academic freedom over the last,

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:32.040
particularly since 2017, on campuses. We have very low viewpoint diversity to begin with,

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:36.600
and under these circumstances, administrators start saying, you know what the problem is?

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:42.520
We have too much heterogeneous thought. We're not homogeneous enough. We actually need,

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:48.920
we need another political litmus test, which is nuts. That's what a DEI statement effectively is

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.040
because there's no way to actually fill out a DEI statement without someone evaluating you on

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:59.720
your politics. It's crystal clear. We even did an experiment on this. Nate Honeycutt,

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:07.400
he got something like almost like 3,000 professors to participate evaluating different kinds of DEI

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:14.120
statements. One was basically like the standard kind of identity politics intersectionality one.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.880
One was about viewpoint diversity. One was about religious diversity, and one was about

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:24.600
socioeconomic diversity. As far as where my heart really is, it's that we have too little

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.840
socioeconomic diversity, particularly in elite higher ed, but also in education period.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:36.600
The experiment had large participation, really interestingly set up, and it tried to model the

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:41.240
way a lot of these DEI policies were actually implemented. One of the ways these have been

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:46.680
implemented, and I think in some of the California schools, is that administrators go through the

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:52.680
DEI statements before anyone else looks at them, and then eliminates people off the top, depending

01:18:52.680 --> 01:19:02.760
on how they feel about their DEI statements. The one on viewpoint diversity, I think like half of

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.720
the people who reviewed it would eliminate it right out. I think it was basically the same for

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:14.680
religious diversity. It was slightly better, like 40 percent for socioeconomic diversity,

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.680
but that kills me. The idea that kind of like, yeah, that actually is the kind of diversity that

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.360
I think we need a great deal more of in higher education. You can agree with it. It's not

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:27.640
hostile to the other kinds, by the way, but the idea that we need more people from the bottom

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:33.560
of three quarters of American society in higher education, I think should be something we could

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:38.840
all get around. The only one that really succeeded was the one that spouted back exactly the kind of

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:45.160
ideology that they thought the reviewers would like, which is like, okay, there's no way this

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:49.720
couldn't be a political litmus test. We've proved that it's a political litmus test, and still

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:55.960
school after school is adding these to its application process to make schools still more

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:59.960
ideologically homogenous. Why does that have a negative effect? Is it because

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.720
it enforces a kind of group think where people are afraid, start becoming afraid to sort of

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:18.840
think and speak freely, liberally about whatever? Well, one, it selects for people who tend to be

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:24.520
farther to the left in a situation where you already have people, a situation where universities do

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:31.640
lean decidedly that way. But it also establishes essentially a set of sacred ideas that if you're

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:40.840
being quizzed on what you've done to advance anti-racism, how you've been conscious of

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:45.400
intersectionality, it's unlikely that you'd actually get in if you said, by the way, I actually

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.200
think these are dubious concepts. I think they're thin. I think they're philosophically not very

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:57.960
defensible. Basically, if your position was, I actually reject these concepts as being over

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:04.760
simple, you're not going to get in. And I think that the person that I always think of that wasn't

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:10.200
a right-winger that would be like, go to hell if you made him fill one of these things out is

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:15.480
Feynman. I feel like if you gave one of these things to Richard Feynman, he'd be like, he would

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:24.680
tear it to pieces and then not get the job. Yeah, there's some element of it that creates this

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:31.320
hard-to-pin-down fear. So you said like the firing, the thing I wanted to say is if you're

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:37.080
firing 100 people or 200 people, the point is even firing one person, I've just seen it,

01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:43.400
it can create this quiet ripple effect of fear. Well, of course. That single firing

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:50.360
of a faculty has a ripple effect across tens of thousands of people, of educators, of

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:57.080
who is hired, what kind of conversations are being had, what kind of textbooks are chosen,

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:02.120
what kind of self-censorship in different flavors of that is happening. It's hard to measure that.

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:07.800
Yeah. I mean, when you ask professors about are they intimidated under the current environment,

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:15.560
the answer is yes, and particularly conservative professors already reporting that they're

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.520
afraid for their jobs in a lot of different cases. You have a lot of good statistics in the book,

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:24.920
things like self-censorship. When provided with the definition of self-censorship,

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.680
at least a quarter of students said they self-censor fairly often or very often during

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.600
conversations with other students, with professors, and during classroom discussions,

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:41.000
25%, 27%, 28%, respectively. A quarter of students also said that they are more likely to self-censor

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:48.200
on campus now at the time they were surveyed than they were when they first started college. So

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:54.200
sort of college is kind of instilling this idea of censorship, self-censorship.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.800
And back to the Red Square comparison, and this is one of the interesting things about the data as

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:02.920
well, is that that same study that I was talking about, the most comprehensive study of the Red

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:07.640
Square, there was polling about whether or not professors were self-censoring due to the fear

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:13.320
of the environment. And 9% of professors said that they were self-censoring their research

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:19.880
and what they were saying. 9% is really bad. That's almost a tenth of professors saying

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:26.360
that their speech was chilled. When we did this question for professors on our latest

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:31.880
faculty survey, when you factor together, we asked them, are they self-censoring in their research,

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.720
are they self-censoring in class, are they self-censoring online, etc. It was 90%

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:43.560
of professors. So the idea that we're actually in an environment that is historic in terms of how

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:48.680
scared people are actually of expressing controversial views, I think that it's the

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.960
reason why we're going to actually be studying this in 50 years, the same way we studied the

01:23:53.960 --> 01:24:00.360
Red Square. The idea that this isn't happening will just be correctly viewed as insane.

01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:06.120
So maybe we can just discuss the leaning, the current leaning of academia towards the left,

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:10.200
which you describe in various different perspectives. So one, there's a voter

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.760
registration ratio chart that you have by department, which I think is interesting.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.840
Can you explain this chart and can you explain what it shows?

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:24.680
Yeah. When I started FIRE in 2001, I didn't take the viewpoint diversity issue as seriously. I

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.080
thought it was just something that right-wingers complained about. But I really started to get

01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:37.400
what happens when you have a community with low viewpoint diversity. Actually, a lot of the

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:44.040
research that I got most interested in was done in conjunction with the great Cass Sunstein, who

01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:49.640
writes a lot about group polarization. The research on this is very strong,

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:55.000
that essentially when you have groups with political diversity, and you can see this

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.680
actually in judges, for example, it tends to produce reliably more moderate outcomes,

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:06.840
whereas groups that have low political diversity tend to spiral off in their own direction.

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:12.760
When you have a super majority of people from just one political perspective, that's a problem for

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:17.800
the production of ideas. It creates a situation where there are sacred ideas. When you look at

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:25.240
some of the departments, I think the estimate from the Crimson is that Harvard has 3% conservatives,

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.000
but when you look at different departments, there are elite departments that have literally no

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:35.480
conservatives in them. I think that's in a healthy intellectual environment.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:40.920
The problem is definitely worse as you get more elite. We definitely see more cases of

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:47.400
lefty professors getting canceled at less elite schools. It gets worse as you get down from the

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.760
elite schools. That's where a lot of the one-third of attempts to get professors punished that are

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:59.480
successful do come from the right, and largely from off-campus sources. We spend a lot of time

01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:04.120
talking about that in the book as well. It's something that I do think is underappreciated.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.440
But when it comes to the low viewpoint diversity, it works out kind of like you'd expect to a degree.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:16.520
Economics is what, four to one or something like that. It's not as bad, but then when you start

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.920
getting into some of the humanities, there are departments that there are literally none.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:29.560
Is there a good why to why did the university faculty administration move to the left?

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:35.080
Yeah. I don't love, and this is an argument that you'll sometimes run into on the left,

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.520
just the argument that, well, people on the left are just smarter.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.640
And it's interesting because at least the research as of 10 years ago was indicating that

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.560
if you dig a little bit deeper into that, a lot of the people who do consider themselves on the left

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:56.680
tend to be a little bit more libertarian. This is something that Pinker wrote a fair amount about.

01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:03.880
The idea that we're just smarter is not an opinion I'm at least a bit comfortable with.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:11.320
I do think that departments take on momentum when they become a place where you're like,

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:15.560
wow, it'd be really unpleasant for me to work in this department if I'm the token conservative,

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:20.600
and I think that takes on a life of its own. There are also departments where a lot of the

01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:28.280
ideology is kind of explicitly leftist. You look at education schools, a lot of the stuff that is

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:33.640
actually left over from what is correctly called critical race theory is present,

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:39.720
and you end up having that in a number of the departments. And it would be very strange to be

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.760
in many departments a conservative social worker professor. I'm sure they exist,

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:50.920
but there's a lot of pressure to shut up if you are.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.880
So the process on the left of cancellation as you started to talk about the perfect

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:04.600
rhetorical fortress, the first step is dismiss a person. If you can put a label of conservative

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:11.160
on them, you can dismiss them in that way. What other efficient or what other effective

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:16.840
dismissal mechanisms are there? We have a little bit of fun with demographic

01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:22.200
numbers. I run this by height, and I remember him being kind of like, don't include the actual

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.360
percentage. I'm like, no, we need to include the actual percentages because people are really bad

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.480
at estimating what the demographics of the U.S. actually looks like, both the right and the left

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:37.800
in different ways. So we put in the numbers, and we talk about being dismissed for being white or

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:43.720
being dismissed for being straight or being dismissed for being male. And you can already

01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:49.240
dismiss people for being conservative. So we give examples in the book of these being used

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:54.280
to dismiss people, and oftentimes on topics not related to the fact that they are male or whether

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:58.280
or not they're minority. And then we get to, I think it's like layer six, and we're like,

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:02.600
surprise, guess what? You're down to 0.4% of the population, and none of it mattered,

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.400
because if you have the wrong opinion, even if you're in that 0.4% of the most intersectional

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.000
person who ever lived and you have the wrong opinion, you're a heretic and you actually

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.120
probably will be hated even more. And the most interesting part of the research we did for this

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:24.440
was just asking every prominent black conservative and moderate that we knew personally,

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:30.600
have you been told that you're not really black for an opinion you had? Every single one of them

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.320
was like, oh yeah, no. And it's kind of funny because it's like oftentimes white lefties

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:38.840
telling them that's like, oh, do you consider yourself black? John McWhorter talked about

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:44.920
having a reporter when he showed that he dissented from some of what he described as kind of like

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:50.280
woke racism in his book, woke ideas. The reporter actually is like, so do you consider yourself

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:56.360
black? He's like, what are you crazy? Of course I do. And Coleman Hughes had one of the best quotes

01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:03.080
on it. He said, I'm constantly being told that the most important thing to how legitimate my opinion

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:08.760
is, is whether or not I'm black. But then when I have a dissenting opinion, I get told I'm not

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:18.600
really black. So perfect. There's no way to falsify this argument. That investigation

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:22.520
really struck me. And you lay this out really nicely in the book, that there is this process

01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:29.160
of saying, are you conservative? Yes, you can dismiss the person. Are you white? Dismiss the

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:34.360
person. Are you male? You can dismiss the person. There's these categories that make it easier for

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:39.320
you to dismiss a person's ideas based on that. And like you said, you end up in that tiny

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:44.040
percentage and you can still dismiss. And it's not just dismiss. We talk about this from a

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:50.440
practical standpoint, the way the limitations on reality. And one of them is time. And a lot of

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:57.000
cancel culture as cultural norms, as this way of winning arguments without winning arguments,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.280
is about running out the clock. Because by the time you get down to the bottom,

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:05.720
or actually even to get a couple steps into the perfect rhetorical fortress,

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:14.280
and where has the time gone? You probably just give up trying to actually have the argument,

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:18.440
and you never get to the argument in the first place. And all of these things are pretty sticky

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.120
on social media. Social media practically invented the perfect rhetorical fortress.

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:28.120
So each one of those stages has a virality to it. So it could stick and then it can get people

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:33.720
really excited. It allows you to feel outrage and superiority. Because of that, at the scale

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:39.480
of the virality allows you to never get to the actual discussion of the point. But it's not just

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:46.280
the left, it's the right, it's also the efficient rhetorical fortress. So something to be proud of

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:52.280
on the right, it's more efficient. So you don't have to listen to liberals and anyone can be

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:58.040
labeled a liberal if they have a wrong opinion. I've seen liberal and left and leftist all

01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:05.400
in the same kind of way, but leftist nonsense. You don't have to listen to experts, even

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:10.200
conservative experts if they have the wrong opinion. You don't have to listen to journalists,

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:15.160
even conservative journalists if they have the wrong opinion. And among the MAGA wing,

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:22.280
there's a fourth provision. You don't need to listen to anyone who isn't pro-Trump.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:27.240
Yeah. And we call it efficient because it eliminates a lot of people you probably

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:32.040
should listen to at least sometimes. We point out sometimes how cancel culture can interfere

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:37.240
with faith and expertise. So we get kind of being a little suspicious of experts.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.040
But at the same time, if you follow that and you follow it mechanically, and I think everybody

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:50.920
in the US probably has some older uncle who exercises some of these, it is a really efficient

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:56.360
way to sort of wall yourself off from the rest of the world and dismiss at least some people

01:32:56.360 --> 01:33:00.520
you really should be listening to. The way you laid it out made me realize that we just

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.080
take up so much of our brain power with these things. It's literally time. We could be solving

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:13.000
things. And you kind of exhaust yourself through this process of being outraged based on these

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.200
labels and you never get to actually, there's almost not enough time for empathy, for looking

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:23.000
at a person thinking, well, maybe they're right because you're so busy categorizing them.

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:30.920
What's the fun in empathy? What's so interesting about this is that so much societal energy seems

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:36.680
to be spent on these nasty primal desires where essentially a lot of it is like,

01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:42.440
please tell me who I'm allowed to hate. Where can I legitimately be cruel? Where can I actually

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:48.040
exercise some aggression against somebody? And it seems to sometimes be just finding new

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:55.240
justifications for that. And it's an understandable human failing that sometimes can be used to

01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:59.400
defend justice. But again, it will never get you anywhere near the truth.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:04.920
One interesting case that you cover about expertise is with COVID.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:05.560
Yeah.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:09.160
So how did cancel culture come into play on the topic of COVID?

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:16.440
Yeah, I think that COVID was a big blow to people's faith and expertise and cancel culture played

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:21.560
a big role in that. I think one of the best examples of this is Jennifer Say at Levi's.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:29.480
She is a lovely woman. She was a vice president at Levi's. She talked about actually potentially

01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:36.840
to be the president of Levi's jeans. And she was a big advocate for kids. And when they started

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.680
shutting down the schools, she started saying, this is going to be a disaster. This is going to hurt

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:50.680
the poor and disadvantaged kids the most. We have to figure out a way to open the schools back up.

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:57.000
And that was such a heretical point of view. And the typical kind of cancel culture wave took over

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.240
is he had all sorts of petitions for her to be fired and that she needed to apologize and

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:06.840
all this kind of stuff. And she was offered, I think, like in a million dollar severance,

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:10.920
which she wouldn't take because she wanted to tell the world what she thought about this and

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:17.160
that she wanted to continue saying that she hadn't changed her mind, that this was a disaster for

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:22.360
young people. And now that's kind of the conventional wisdom. And the research is

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:28.600
quite clear that this was devastating to particularly disadvantaged youth. Like,

01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:34.280
people understand this as being, okay, she was probably right. But one of the really sad aspects

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:40.040
of cancel culture is people forget why you were canceled and they just know they hate you.

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:44.440
There's this lingering kind of like, well, I don't have to take them seriously anymore.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:48.840
By the way, did you notice they happen to be right on something very important? Now,

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.240
one funny thing about freedom of speech, freedom of speech wouldn't exist if you didn't also have

01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:59.640
the right to say things that were wrong. Because if you can't engage in ideaphoria, if you can't

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.800
actually speculate, you'll never actually get to something that's right in the first place.

01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:10.600
But it's especially galling when people who were right were censored and never actually

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:15.640
got the credit that they deserve. Well, this might be a good place to ask a little bit more

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.800
about the freedom of speech. And you said that included in the freedom of speech is to say things

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:31.640
that are wrong. Yep. What is your perspective on hate speech? Hate speech is the best marketing

01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:39.800
campaign for censorship. And it came from academia of the 20th century. And that when I talked about

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:44.920
the anti-free speech movement, that was one of their first inventions. There was a lot of talk

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:51.160
about critical race theory and being against critical race theory. And FIRE will sue if you

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:56.920
say that people can't advocate for it or teach it or research it, because you do absolutely have

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:03.640
the right to pursue it academically. However, every time someone mentions CRT, they should also

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:10.920
say the very first project of the people who founded CRT, Richard Delgado, Mary Matsuda,

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:17.160
et cetera, was to create this new category of unprotected speech called hate speech and to get

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:23.800
it banned. The person who enabled this draft, of course, was Herbert Marcuse in 1965, basically

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:27.800
questioning whether or not free speech should be a sacred value on the left. And he was on the

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.160
losing side for a really long time. The liberals, the way I grew up, that was basically

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:39.480
being pro-free speech was synonymous with being a liberal. But that started to be etched away on

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:47.640
campus. And the way it was was with the idea of hate speech, that essentially, oh, but we can

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:55.080
designate particularly bad speech as not protected. And who's going to enforce it? Who's going to

01:37:55.080 --> 01:38:00.520
decide what hate speech actually is? Well, it's usually overwhelmingly can only happen in an

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.000
environment of really low viewpoint diversity, because you have to actually agree on what the

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.760
most hateful and wrong things are. And there's a bedrock principle. It's referred to this in

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:16.760
a great case about flag burning in the First Amendment that I think all the world could

01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:23.240
benefit from. You can't ban speech just because it's offensive. It's too subjective. It basically,

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:28.600
it's one of the reasons why these kind of codes have been more happily adopted in places like

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.440
Europe, where they have a sense that there's like a modal German or a modal Englishman.

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:40.360
And I think this is offensive. And therefore, I can say that this is wrong. In a more multicultural,

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:45.720
in a genuinely more diverse country that's never actually had an honest thought that there is a

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:51.240
single kind of American, there's never been like, we had the idea of Uncle Sam, but that was always

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:55.880
kind of a joke. Boston always knew it wasn't Richmond, always knew it wasn't Georgia, always

01:38:55.880 --> 01:39:03.000
knew it wasn't Alaska. We've always been a hodgepodge. And we get in a society that diverse

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.800
that you can't ban things simply because they're offensive. And that's one of the reasons why hate

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:15.960
speech is not an unprotected category of speech. And I go further. My theory on freedom of speech

01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:21.160
is slightly different than most other constitutional lawyers. And I think that's partially because

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:27.240
some of these theories, although a lot of them are really good, are inadequate. They're not expansive

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:33.240
enough. And I sometimes call my theory the pure informational theory of freedom of speech. Or

01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.520
sometimes when I want to be fancy, the lab and the looking glass theory. And its most important

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:44.600
tenet is that if the goal is the project of human knowledge, which is to know the world as it is,

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:50.840
you cannot know the world as it is without knowing what people really think.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.440
And what people really think is an incredibly important fact to know. So every time you're

01:39:56.440 --> 01:40:00.760
actually saying, you can't say that, you're actually depriving yourself of the knowledge

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:05.480
of what people really think. You're causing what Timur Koran, who's on our board of advisors,

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:11.000
calls preference falsification. You end up with an inaccurate picture of the world, which by the way,

01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:16.120
in a lot of cases, because there are activists who want to restrict more speech, they actually

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:21.240
tend to think that people are more prejudiced than they might be. And actually these kind of

01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:26.840
restrictions, there was a book called Racial Paranoia that came out about 15 years ago,

01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:31.080
that was making the point that the imposition of some of these codes can sometimes make people

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.400
think that the only thing holding you back from being a raging racist are these codes. So it must

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.400
be really, really bad. It can actually make all these things worse. And one, which we talk about

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:46.920
in the book, one very real practical way it makes things worse is when you censor people,

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.760
it doesn't change their opinion. It just encourages them to not share it with people who will get them

01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:58.200
in trouble. So it leads them to talk to people who they already agree with and group polarization

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:05.160
takes off. So we have some interesting data in the book about how driving people off of Twitter,

01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:13.320
for example, in 2017, and then again, I think in 2020, driving people to gab led to greater

01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:18.680
radicalization among those people. It's a very predictable force. Censorship doesn't actually

01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:24.520
change people's minds and it pushes them in directions that actually by very solid research

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:30.920
will actually make them more radicalized. So yeah, I think that the attempt to ban hate speech,

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:37.640
it doesn't really protect us from it, but it gives the government such a vast weapon to use against

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:44.680
us that we will regret giving them. Is there a way to sort of to look at extreme cases,

01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:51.960
to test this idea out a little bit? So if we look on campus, what's your view about allowing,

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:58.360
say, white supremacists on campus to do to do speeches? Okay, okay. I think you should be able

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:05.800
to study what people think and I think it's important that we actually do. So I think that,

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:13.480
you know, let's take, for example, QAnon. Yeah, QAnon's wrong. But where did it come from? Why

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.120
did they think that? What's the motivation? Who taught them it? Who came up with these ideas?

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:24.040
This is important to understand history. That's important to understand modern American politics.

01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:32.200
And so if you put your scholar hat on, you should be curious about kind of everyone,

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.560
about where they're coming from. Daryl Davis, who I'm sure you're familiar with, part of his

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.640
goal was just simply to get to know where people were coming from. And in the process,

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.880
he actually de-radicalized a number of clients' members. When they actually realized that this

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:50.920
black man who had befriended them actually was compassionate, was a decent person, they realized

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:55.240
all their preconceptions were wrong. So it can have a de-radicalizing factor, by the way,

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.400
but even when it doesn't, it's still really important to know what the bad people in your

01:42:59.400 --> 01:43:05.880
society think. Honestly, in some ways, for your own safety, it's probably more important to know

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:10.360
what the bad people in your society actually think. I personally, I don't know what you think about

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.280
that, but I personally think that freedom of speech in cases like that, like KKK on campus,

01:43:14.840 --> 01:43:22.360
can do more harm in the short term, but much more benefit in the long term. Because you can

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:28.840
sometimes argue for like, this is going to hurt in the short term. But I mean, Harvey said this,

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:33.880
is like, consider the alternative. Because you've just kind of made the case for like,

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.280
this potentially would be a good thing, even in the short term. And it often is, I think,

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:43.400
especially in a stable society like ours, with a strong middle class, all these kinds of things,

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:50.520
where people have the comforts to reason through things. But to me, it's like, even if it hurts

01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:55.560
in the short term, even if it does create more hate in the short term, the freedom of speech has

01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:01.400
this really beneficial thing, which is it helps you move towards the truth, the entirety of society,

01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:09.400
towards a deeper, more accurate understanding of life on earth, of society, of how people function,

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:16.040
of ethics, of metaphysics, of everything. And that, in the long term, is a huge benefit.

01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:21.560
It gets rid of the Nazis in the long term, even if it adds to the number of Nazis in the short term.

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:27.000
And the reality check part of this is people always bring up, what about the Klan on campus?

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:33.480
I'm like, they're never invited. I haven't seen a case where they've been invited.

01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:40.120
Usually, the Klan argument gets thrown out when people are trying to excuse,

01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:45.720
and that's why we shouted down Ben Shapiro. And that's why you can't have Bill Maher on campus.

01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:51.800
That's why, and it's like, okay. And it's a little bit of that what about-ism again,

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.000
about being like, well, that thing over there is terrible, and therefore, this comedian

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:02.440
shouldn't come. So I do have a question, maybe by way of advice, interviewing folks and

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:10.200
seeing this like a podcast as a platform in deciding who to talk to and not. That's

01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.920
something I have to come face to face with on occasion. My natural inclination before

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:21.400
I started the podcast was I would talk to anyone, including people, which I'm still interested in,

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:29.320
who are current members of the KKK. And to me, there's a responsibility to do that with skill.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:30.460
Yeah.

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:36.600
And that responsibility has been weighing heavier and heavier on me because you realize how much

01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.600
skill it actually takes because you have to know to understand so much because I've come to understand

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:49.000
that the devil is always going to be charismatic. The devil is not going to look like the devil.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:56.280
And so you have to realize you can't always come to the table with a deep compassion for

01:45:56.280 --> 01:46:03.240
another human being. You have to have like 90% compassion and another 90% deep historical

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:07.560
knowledge about the context of the battles around this particular issue. And that takes

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:12.600
just a huge amount of effort. But I don't know if there's thoughts you have about this, how to

01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:22.120
handle speech in a way without censoring, bringing it to the surface,

01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.200
but in a way that creates more love in the world.

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:32.760
I remember Steve Bannon got disinvited from the New Yorker Festival and Jim Carrey freaked out and

01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:38.360
all sorts of other people freaked out and he got disinvited. And I got invited to speak on

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:47.160
Smirconish about this. And I was saying like, listen, you don't have people to your conference

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:53.720
because you agree with them. We have to get out of this idea because they were trying to make it

01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.240
sound like that's an endorsement of Steve Bannon. Like that's nonsense. Like if you actually look

01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.800
at the opinions of all the people who are there, you can't possibly endorse all the opinions that

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.880
all these other people who are going to be there actually have. And in the process of making that

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:11.480
argument I got, and also, of course, the very classic, it's very valuable to know what someone

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:16.120
Steve Bannon thinks. You should be curious about that. And I remember someone arguing back saying,

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.160
well, would you want someone to interview a jihadi? And I'm like, because at the moment,

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:29.640
it was the time when ISIS was really going for it. And I was like, would you not want to go to a

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:34.360
talk where someone was trying to figure out what makes some of these people tick? Because that

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:39.800
changes your framing. That essentially it's like, no, it's curiosity is the cure for a lot of this

01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:45.000
stuff. And we need a great deal more curiosity and a lot less unwarranted certainty. And there's a

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:51.480
question of like, how do you conduct such conversations? And I feel deeply underqualified.

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:56.600
Who do you think is especially good at that? I feel like documentary filmmakers usually do a

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:02.760
much better job. And the best job is usually done by biographers. So the more time you give to a

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:09.080
particular conversation, like really deep thought and historical context and studying the people,

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:12.680
how they think, looking at all different perspectives, looking at the psychology of

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:17.720
the person, upbringing their parents, their grandparents, all of this, the more time you

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:28.120
spend with that, the better the quality of the conversation is because you get to really empathize

01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.800
with the person, with the people he or she represents. And you get to see the common

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:41.320
humanity, all of this. Interviewers are often don't do that work. So like the best stuff I've

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.360
seen is interviews that are part of a documentary. But even now documentaries are like, there's a

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:51.160
huge incentive to do as quickly as possible. There's not an incentive to really spend time

01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:56.040
with the person. There's a great new documentary about Floyd Abrams that I really recommend.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:49:02.920
We did a documentary about Ira Glasser called Mighty Ira, which was my video team and my protege

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:09.240
Nico Perino and Chris Mulby and Aaron Reese put it together. And it just follows the life and times

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.840
of Ira Glasser, the former head of the ACLU. If you could just linger on that,

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:21.000
that's a fascinating story. Oh yeah, Ira's amazing. Ira, he wasn't a lawyer. He started

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:28.120
working at the NYCLU, New York Civil Liberties Union, back in I think the 60s. I think Robert

01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:35.160
Kennedy recommended that he go in that direction. And he became the president of the ACLU right at

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:43.880
the time that they were suffering from defending the Nazis at Skokie. And Nico and Aaron and Chris

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:49.240
put together this and they'd never done a documentary before. And it came out so, so well.

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.880
And it tells the story of the Nazis in Skokie. It tells the story of the case around it. It

01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:00.440
tells the story of the ACLU at the time and what a great leader Ira Glasser was. And one of the

01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:07.480
things that's so great is when you get to see the Nazis at Skokie, they come off like the idiots

01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:12.840
that you would expect them to. There's a moment when the rally is not going very well and the

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:18.920
leader gets flustered. And it almost seems like he's going to shout out, you're making this Nazi

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:25.560
rally into a mockery. So it showed how actually allowing the Nazis to speak at Skokie kind of

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:31.640
took the wind out of their sails. The whole movement, everybody was kind of, it all kind

01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:37.800
of dissolved after that because they looked like racist fools that they were. Even Blues Brothers

01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:43.960
made jokes about them. And it didn't turn into the disaster that people thought it was going to be

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:51.160
just by letting them speak. And Ira Glasser, okay, so he has this wonderful story about how

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:57.480
Jackie Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and how there was a moment when it was seeing

01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:03.400
someone, an African-American as on their, literally on their team and how that really got him excited

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.720
about the cause of racial equality and that became a big part of what his life was.

01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:15.480
And I just think of that as such a great metaphor is expanding your circle and seeing more people

01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.280
as being quite literally on your team is the solution to so many of these problems.

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:25.000
And I worry that one of the things that is absolutely just a fact of life in America is

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.960
we do see each other more as enemy camps as opposed to people on the same team.

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.840
And that was actually something in the early days, like me and Will Creeley, the legal director of

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:40.200
FIRE, wrote about the forthcoming free speech challenges of everyone being on Facebook.

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:47.480
And one thing that I was hoping was that as more people were exposing more of their lives,

01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:51.320
we'd realize a lot of these things we knew intellectually, like kids go to the bar and

01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:59.160
get drunk and do stupid things, that when we started seeing the evidence of them doing stupid

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.320
things that we might be shocked at first, but then eventually get more sophisticated and be like,

01:52:03.320 --> 01:52:06.840
well, come on, people are like that. That never actually really seemed to happen.

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:13.240
I think that there are plenty of things we know about human nature and we know about

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:21.000
dumb things people say. And we've made it into an environment where there's just someone out there

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.920
waiting to be kind of like, oh, remember that dumb thing you said we were 14? Well,

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:27.960
I'm going to make sure that you don't get into your dream school because of that.

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.480
That's offense archaeology.

01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.960
That's not my term, though. It's a great term.

01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:36.440
Well, it's a great term. We steal from the best. Digging through someone's past comments to find

01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:41.240
a speech that hasn't aged well. And that one's tactical. That one isn't just someone not being

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.480
empathetic. They're like, I'm going to punish you for this. And that's one of the reasons why I got

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:51.560
depressed writing this book, because there's already people who don't love me because of

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:55.240
coddling the American mind, usually based on a misunderstanding of what we actually said in

01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:01.400
coddling in the American mind, but nonetheless. But on this one, I'm calling out people for being

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:09.240
very cruel in a lot of cases. But one thing that was really scary about studying a lot of these

01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:13.640
cases is that once you have that target on your back, what they're going to try to cancel you for

01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:20.760
could be anything. They might go back into your old post, find something that you said in 1995,

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:29.000
do something where essentially it looks like it's this entire other thing, but really what's going

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.760
on is they didn't like your opinion. They didn't like your point of view on something. And they're

01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.560
going to find a way that from now on, anytime your name comes up, it's like, oh, remember this thing

01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.600
I didn't like about him? And it's, again, it's cruel. It doesn't get you anywhere closer to the

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:48.440
truth. And, but it is a little scary to stick your neck out. Okay. In terms of solutions,

01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:54.760
I'm going to ask you a few things. So one, uh, parenting. Yeah. Five and seven year old.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:54:01.080
So I'm sure you've figured it all out then. Oh God, no. From a free speech perspective.

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.160
Yeah. From a free speech culture perspective, how to be a good parent.

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:10.760
Yeah. I think the first quality you should be cultivating in your children,

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:18.440
if you want to have a free speech culture is curiosity and an awareness of the vastness

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:24.360
that will always be unknown and getting my kids excited about the idea. That's like,

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:31.240
we're going to spend our whole lives learning about stuff. And it's fast and exciting and endless.

01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:35.160
And we'll never make a big dent in it, but the journey will be amazing,

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:41.560
but only fools think they know everything. Um, and sometimes dangerous fools at that.

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:47.320
So giving the sense of intellectual humility early on being also, you know,

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:52.040
saying things that actually do sound kind of old fashioned, like, but I say things to my kids,

01:54:52.040 --> 01:55:00.040
like, listen, if you enjoy study and work, both things that I very much enjoy, I do for fun.

01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:06.360
Um, your life is going to feel great and it's going to feel easy. Um, so some, some, you know,

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:11.000
some of those old fashioned virtues of things I try to preach, um, counterintuitive stuff,

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.440
like outdoor time playing, um, having time that are not intermediated experiences is really,

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:24.040
is really important and little things like, um, I talk about in the book about when my kids

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.440
are watching something that's scary and I'm not talking about like zombie movies, you know,

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:33.000
I'm talking about like, you know, a cartoon that has kind of a scary moment and saying that they

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.440
want to turn the TV off. And I, and I talked to them and I say, listen, I'm going to sit next

01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:43.960
to you and we're going to finish this show and I want you to tell me what you think of, of this

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:51.560
afterwards. And I sat next to my sons. Um, and by the end of it, every single time I, you know,

01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:55.000
when I asked them, was that as scary as you thought it was going to be? And there was like,

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.720
no daddy, that was fine. And I'm like, that's one of the great lessons in life. The fear that you

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:05.720
don't go through becomes much bigger in your head than actually simply facing it. That's one of the

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:09.640
reasons why I'm fighting back against this culture. I love, you know, for all of our kids to be able

01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:15.640
to grow up in an environment where people give you grace and, you know, except the fact that

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:19.240
sometimes people are going to say things that piss you off, take seriously the possibility

01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:25.160
be wrong and, and, uh, be curious. Well, I'm, I have hope that the thing you mentioned, which is

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.200
because so much of young people's stuff is on the internet that they're going to give each other a

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.800
break because then everybody's cancel worthy. Generation Z hates cancel culture the most. And

01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.400
that's another reason why it's like people still claiming this is even happening. It's kind of

01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:44.200
like, no, you actually can ask, you know, kids what they think of cancel culture and they hate it.

01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.560
Yeah. Well, I kind of think of them as like the immune system. That's like,

01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.920
that's the culture waking up to like, no, this is not a good thing.

01:56:51.480 --> 01:56:56.840
I am glad though. I mean, I, I, I'm one of those kids who, you know, is really glad that I was a

01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:02.120
little kid in the eighties and a teenager in the nineties, because having everything potentially

01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:09.480
online, uh, it's, it's not a, an upbringing. I envy. Well, I, because you can also do the

01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:17.320
absolute free speech. I like leaning into it. Yeah. Where I hope for a future where

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:25.080
a lot of our insecurities, flaws, everything's out there. Yeah. And to be raw honest with it,

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:31.560
I think that leads to a better world because the flaws are beautiful. I mean, that's the flaws is

01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:37.480
the, uh, the basic ingredients of human connection. Uh, Robert Wright, he wrote a book on, uh, on,

01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:43.160
on Buddhism. Um, and I talked about trying to use social media from a, from a Buddhist perspective

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:49.720
and like, as if you're, as if it's the collective unconscious meditating and seeing those little

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:55.400
like angry bits that are trying to cancel you or get you to shut up and just kind of like letting

01:57:55.400 --> 01:58:00.120
them go the same way you're supposed to watch your thoughts kind of trail off. I would love to see

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:06.440
that like visualized, whatever the, whatever the drama going on, going on, just seeing the sea of

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.840
of the collective consciousness, just processing this and having a little like panic attack and

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:17.480
just kind of like reading it in looking at the little sort of hateful, angry voices kind of

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:22.840
pop up and be like, okay, there you are. And I'm still focused on, on that thing because that is,

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:28.200
that, that is one of the things is, okay. Yeah. Actually this is probably late in the game to be

01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:37.480
giving my grand theory on this stuff. Um, but, uh, never too late. So, so when I was studying, um,

01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:42.120
in law school, when I ran out of first amendment classes, um, I decided to study censorship during

01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:46.840
the tutor dynasty, uh, because that's where we get our ideas of prior restraint, uh, that, that come

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:51.320
from the licensing of the printing press, um, which was something that Henry the eighth was the first

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:57.000
to do where basically, um, the idea was that if you can't print anything in England, unless it's

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:04.360
with these, uh, uh, your majesty approved printers, um, it will prevent heretical work

01:59:04.360 --> 01:59:09.640
and anti Henry the eighth stuff from coming out. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, um,

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:17.000
efficient idea if nothing else. Um, and I always, so he started getting angry at the printing press

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:22.680
around 1521 and then pass something, um, that required prints prints to be along with parliament

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:29.160
in, uh, 1538. Uh, and I always think of that as kind of like where we are now, um, because we have

01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:33.720
this, we had the, back then we had the original disruptive technology, you know, writing was

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:38.440
probably the next one, which, which was the printing press, which was absolutely calamitous.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:44.280
And I mean, and I, and I say calamitous on purpose because in the short term, the witch hunts went

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:49.560
up like crazy because the printing press allowed you to get that manual on how to find witches,

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:56.280
that the religious wars went crazy. Um, that led to all sorts of distress, misinformation,

01:59:56.840 --> 02:00:01.240
nastiness. And Henry the eighth was trying to put the genie back in the bottle. You know, he was

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:06.280
kind of like, I can, I can, I can, I want to use this for good. Like, uh, like I feel like it could,

02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:14.120
it could be used, but he was in an unavoidable period of epistemic anarchy. There's nothing you

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:19.880
can do to make the period after the printing press come, uh, came out to be a non disruptive,

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:25.160
non crazy period other than like absolute totalitarianism and destroy all the print

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:30.920
presses, which simply was not possible in Europe. So I feel like that's kind of like where we are

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:36.600
now. That disruption came from adding, I think, you know, several million people to the European

02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:41.000
conversation and that eventually the global conversation, but eventually it became the

02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:47.800
best tool for disconfirmation, for getting rid of falsity, for spotting bad ideas.

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:54.920
And it's the benefits, the long-term benefits of the printing press are incalculably great.

02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.880
And that's what gives me some optimism for where we are now with social media,

02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:04.520
because we are in that unavoidably anarchical period. And I do worry that, that there, um,

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:09.400
that there are attempts in States to pass things, to try to put the genie back in the bottle. Like

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:16.200
if we ban a tick tock or we say that, um, nobody under 18 can be on the, on the internet,

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:23.880
unless they have parental permission, we're going at something that no amount of sort of top down

02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:29.480
is going to be able to fix it. We have to culturally adapt to the fact of it, um, uh,

02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:38.360
in ways that make us wiser that actually, um, and allow it potentially to be that wonderful engine

02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:44.280
for disconfirmation that we're nowhere near yet, by the way. But think about it, additional millions

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:49.720
of eyes on problems, um, thanks to the printing press helped create the scientific revolution,

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:57.400
the enlightenment, the discovery of ignorance. Um, we now have added billions of eyes and voices

02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.240
to solving problems and we're just, we're using them for cat videos and canceling.

02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:05.320
But that, those are just the early days of the printing press.

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:11.720
All starts with the cats and the canceling. Is there something about X, about Twitter,

02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:17.400
which is perhaps the most, uh, energetic source of cats and canceling?

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:19.960
It seems like the collective unconscious of the species. I mean, like

02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.320
it's one of these things where the tendency to want to see patterns in history sometimes can

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:35.080
limit the actual batshit crazy experience of what history actually is. Because yes,

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:38.680
we, we, we, we have these nice comforting ideas that it's going to be like last time.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:46.120
We don't know. It, it, it, it hasn't happened yet. And I think how unusual Twitter is,

02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:52.840
because I think of it as like the, uh, because people talk about, you know, writing and, um,

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:58.520
mass communications and, uh, as being expanding the size of our collective brain.

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:03.800
But now we're kind of looking at our collective brain in real time and it's filled just like our

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:08.760
own brains with all sorts of like little crazy things that pop up and, and, and appear like

02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:14.840
virtual particles kind of all over the place of, of people, um, you know, reacting in real time

02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:21.320
to things. There's never been anything even vaguely like it. And it can be at its worst awful to see

02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:27.320
at its best, sometimes seeing people like just getting euphoric over something going on and

02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.640
cracking absolutely brilliant immediate jokes, uh, you know, at the same time, it can be,

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:40.280
it can't even be a joyful experience. Um, I, I feel like, uh, and, uh, I live in a neighborhood

02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:45.480
now on X where I mostly deal with people that I think are actually thoughtful, even if I disagree

02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:50.920
with them. Um, and, and it's not such a bad experience. I occasionally run into those other

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:56.280
sort of what I call neighborhoods on X where it's just all canceling, all nastiness, and it's always

02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.560
kind of an unpleasant visit to those places. I'm not saying the whole thing needs to be, uh, like,

02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:07.480
like my experience, but I do think that the reason why people keep on coming back to it is it reveals

02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:14.920
raw aspects of humanity that sometimes we prefer to pretend don't exist. Yeah, but also it's totally

02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:20.040
new. Like you said, it's just a virality, the speed that news travels, that opinions travel,

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.800
that the battle over ideas travels and battle over information too. Yeah. Of what is true and not

02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:31.160
lies traveled, the old Mark Twain thing pretty fast on the thing. Yeah. And then it changes your

02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:37.640
understanding of how to interpret information. It also stress you out to know. And I remember

02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:42.840
to get off it. Sometimes the stats are pretty bad on mental health, uh, with, with, with young

02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:46.600
people. And I'm definitely in the camp of people who think that social media is part of that. I

02:04:46.600 --> 02:04:51.160
understand, you know, the debate, but I'm pretty persuaded that one of the things that is, hasn't

02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:57.320
been great for mental health of people is this just constantly being exposed. Yeah, absolutely.

02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:03.640
I think it's possible to create social media that makes a huge amount of money, makes people happy.

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:10.520
To me, like it's possible to align the, the incentives. So in terms of, yeah, making teenagers,

02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:16.120
making, uh, every stage of life, giving you long-term fulfillment and happiness with your

02:05:16.120 --> 02:05:20.920
physical existence outside of the social media and on social media, helping you grow as a human

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:25.560
being, uh, helping challenge you just the right amount and just the right amount of cat videos,

02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:32.360
whatever gives this full rich human experience. I think it's just a machine learning problem.

02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:38.520
It's like, it's not easy to create a feed. So the easiest feed you could do is like maximize

02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:45.160
engagement. But that's just like a really dumb algorithm. It's like for the, for the algorithm

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:51.640
to learn enough about you to understand what will make you truly happy as a human being to grow

02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:57.560
long-term. That's just a very difficult problem to solve. Have you ever watched Fleabag? It's

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:02.920
absolutely brilliant, a British show. Um, and it sets you up. One of the reasons why like people

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:07.400
love it so much is it sets you up that you're watching like a, a raunchy British sex in the

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:13.640
city, except the main character is the most promiscuous one. Um, it's like, okay. And you

02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:18.360
kind of roll your eyes a little bit and it's kind of funny and it's kind of cute and kind of spicy.

02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:25.480
And then you realize that the person is actually kind of suffering and having a hard time and it

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:31.640
gets deeper and deeper as the show goes on. And she will do these incredible speeches about,

02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:36.440
tell me what to do. Like I just, I know there's experts out there. I know there's knowledge out

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.720
there. I know there's an optimal way to live my life. So why can't someone just tell me what to

02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:50.680
do? And, and it's this wonderfully like, um, accurate, I think, uh, aspect of, of human desire

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:56.520
that what if something could actually tell me the optimal way to go? Cause I think there is a desire

02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:03.320
to give up some amount of your own freedom and discretion in order to be told to do the optimally

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:09.160
right thing. But that path scares me to death. Yeah. Well, see the way you phrased it, that's,

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:13.960
I mean, it scares me too. So there's several things. One, you can be constantly distracted

02:07:13.960 --> 02:07:21.720
in a TikTok way by things that keep you engaged. So removing that and giving you a bunch of options

02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:29.560
constantly and learning from long-term what results in your actual long-term happiness.

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:35.880
So like which amounts of challenging ideas are good for you? Uh, that, you know, for,

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:43.160
for somebody like me, just for, but there is a number like that for you, Greg, like for me,

02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:50.040
that number is pretty high. I love debate. I love, I, I love the feeling of like realizing,

02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:55.640
holy shit, I've been wrong. But like, you know, and I would love for the algorithm to know that

02:07:55.640 --> 02:08:01.000
about me and to help me, but always giving me options if I want to descend into cat videos

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.720
and so on. Well, the educational aspect of it. Yes, education. Yes. Like the idea of kind of like

02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.040
both going the speed that you need to and running as fast as you can. Yeah. You know, I mean,

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:15.400
there's that, you know, the whole flow thing. I just feel that YouTube recommendation for,

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:20.840
for better or worse, if used correctly, it feels like it does a pretty good job. Whenever I just

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:26.280
refuse to click on stuff that's just dopamine based and click on only educational things.

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:31.320
Yeah. The recommendation it provides are really damn good. So I feel like it's a solvable

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:37.080
problem, at least in the space of education of challenging yourself, but also expanding your

02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:40.680
realm of knowledge and all this kind of stuff. And I'm definitely more in the, we're in an

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:46.280
inescapably anarchical period and require big cultural adjustments. And there's going to,

02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.280
there's no way that this isn't going to be difficult transition. Is there any specific

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:56.840
little or big things that you'd like to see X do, Twitter do? I have lots of thoughts on that.

02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:01.800
With the printing press, an extra millions of eyes on any problem can tear down any institution,

02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:06.360
any, any person or any idea. And that's good in some ways because a lot of medieval institutions

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:11.080
needed to be torn down. And some people did too, and a lot of ideas needed to be torn down. Same

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:15.800
thing is true now. An extra billions of eyes on every problem can tear down any person, idea,

02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:22.360
institution. And some, again, some of those things needed to be torn down, but it can't build yet.

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:26.840
We are not at the stage that can build yet, but it has shown us how thin our knowledge was. It's

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:30.200
one of the reasons why we're also aware of the replication crisis. It's one of the reasons why

02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:36.600
we're also aware of how kind of shoddy our research is, how much our expert class is arrogant in many

02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:42.360
cases, but people don't want to live in a world where they don't have people that they respect

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:50.520
and they can look at. And I think what's happening, possibly now, but will continue to happen,

02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:53.880
is people are going to establish themselves as being high integrity, that they will always be

02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:59.240
honest. I think you are establishing yourself as someone who is high integrity, where they can trust

02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:03.960
that person. A fire wants to be the institution that people can come to. It's like, if it's free

02:10:03.960 --> 02:10:11.320
speech, we will defend it, period. And I think that people need new, need to have authorities

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:15.160
that they can actually trust. And I think that if you actually had a stream that maybe people can

02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:22.360
watch in action, but not flood with stupid cancel culture stuff or dumb cat means, where it is

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:27.160
actually a serious discussion, bounded around rules, no perfect rhetorical fortress, no efficient

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:32.920
rhetorical fortress, none of the BS ways we debate. I think you could start to actually create

02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:38.440
something that could actually be a major improvement in the speed with which we come up with new,

02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.800
better ideas and establish and separate truth from falsity.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:46.920
Yeah. If it's done well, it can inspire a large number of people to become higher and higher

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:53.720
integrity. It can create integrity as a value to strive for. There's been projects throughout

02:10:53.720 --> 02:10:59.400
the internet that have done an incredible job of that, but have been also very flawed.

02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:03.720
Wikipedia is an example of a big leap forward in doing that.

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:07.640
It's pretty damn impressive. What's your overall take? I mean, I'm mostly impressed.

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:15.400
So there's a few really powerful ideas for the people who edit Wikipedia. One of which is each

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:23.880
editor kind of for themselves declares, you know, I'm into politics and I really kind of left leaning

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:30.520
guy. So I really shouldn't be editing political articles because I have bias. So they declare

02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:35.000
their biases and they're often do a good job of actually declaring the biases, but they'll still

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:41.320
like, they'll find a way to justify themselves. Like something will piss them off and they want

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:47.720
to correct it because they, they love correcting untruth into truth, but the perspective of what

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:51.000
is true and not is affected by their bias. Truth is hard to know.

02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.560
And it is true that there is a left leaning bias on the editors of Wikipedia. So for that,

02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:04.040
what happens is on articles, which I mostly appreciate that don't have a political

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:11.080
aspect to them, you know, um, scientific articles or, uh, technical articles,

02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:15.720
they're going to be really strong, even history, just describing the facts of history.

02:12:15.720 --> 02:12:22.600
They don't have a subjective element, a strong, also just using my own brain. I can kind of filter

02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:27.000
out if it's, uh, you know, if it's something about January 6th or something like this,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.880
I know I'm going to be like, I'm not whatever's going on here. I'm gonna kind of read it,

02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.560
but most I'm going to look to other sources. I'm going to look to a bunch of different

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.120
perspectives on it's going to be very tense. There's probably going to be some kind of bias,

02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:46.760
maybe some wording will be such, which is one word. This is where Wikipedia does this thing.

02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:54.520
The way they word stuff will be biased, the choice of words, but the Wikipedia editors

02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:59.720
themselves are so self-reflective. They literally have articles describing these very effects

02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:05.560
of how you can use words to inject bias in all the ways that you talk about it.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.720
That sounds healthier than most environments.

02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:13.000
It's incredibly healthy, but I think you could do better. One of the big flaws of Wikipedia to me

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:18.920
that community notes on X does better is the accessibility of becoming an editor.

02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:26.920
It's difficult to become an editor and it's not as visible, the process of editing. So I would love,

02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:34.120
like you said, a stream for everyone to be able to observe this debate between people with integrity

02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:39.480
of when they discuss things like January 6th. They're very controversial topics to see how

02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.880
the process of the debate goes as opposed to it being hidden in the shadows, which it currently

02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:50.520
is in Wikipedia. You can access it, it's just hard to access. I've also seen how they will use

02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:56.520
certain articles on certain people. Articles about people I've learned to trust less and less.

02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:02.760
They'll literally use those to make personal attacks. This is something you write about.

02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:10.280
They'll use descriptions of different controversies to paint a picture of a person that doesn't to me

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:15.880
at least feel like an accurate representation of the person. It's like writing an article about

02:14:15.880 --> 02:14:21.400
Einstein mentioning something about theory of relativity and saying that he was a womanizer

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:31.400
and abuser and like controversy. Yeah, he is. Feynman also, they're not exactly the perfect

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:39.160
human in terms of women, but there's other aspects to this human and to capture that human properly,

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:45.480
there's a certain way to do it. I think Wikipedia will often lean. They really try to be self-reflective

02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:52.760
and try to stop this, but they will lean into the drama if it matches the bias. But again,

02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:02.520
the world, I believe, is much better because Wikipedia exists. But now that we're in these

02:15:02.520 --> 02:15:06.280
adolescent stages, we're growing and trying to come up with different technologies, the idea of a

02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:13.720
stream is really, really interesting. As you get more and more people into this discourse where

02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:20.040
the value is, let's try to get the truth. Yeah. Basically, you get the little cards for nope,

02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.880
wrong, nope, wrong. And the different rhetorical techniques that are being used to avoid actually

02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:29.000
discussing. Yeah, and I think actually you can make it a little bit fun by you get a limited

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.760
number of them. It's kind of like you get three whataboutism cards. It's a game of finding the

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:41.400
whole thing. Absolutely. Yeah. Let me ask you about, as you mentioned, going through some difficult

02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:48.680
moments in your life, what has been your experience with depression? What has been

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:54.280
your experience getting out of it, overcoming it? Yeah. I mean, the whole thing, the whole journey

02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:03.800
with Coddling the American Mind began with me at the Belmont Psychiatric Facility in Philadelphia

02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:11.400
back in 2007. I had called 911 in a moment of clarity because I'd gone to the hardware store

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:17.480
to make sure that when I killed myself that it stuck. I wanted to make sure that I had my

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:21.800
head wrapped and everything. So like if all the drugs I was planning to take didn't work,

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:28.760
that I wouldn't be able to claw my way out. It'd been a really rough year and I always had issues

02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:34.280
with depression, but they were getting worse. And frankly, one of the reasons why this cancel culture

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:41.080
stuff is so important to me is that the thing that I didn't emphasize as much in Coddling the American

02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:45.400
Mind, which by the way, that description that I give of trying to kill myself was the first time

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:52.360
I'd ever written it down. Nobody in my family was aware of it being like that. My wife had never

02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:56.360
seen it. And basically the only way I was able to write that was by doing, you know how you can kind

02:16:56.360 --> 02:17:02.200
of trick yourself. And I was like, I'm going to convince myself that this is just between me and

02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.800
my computer and nobody will see it. And it's probably now the most public thing I've ever written.

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:13.080
But what I didn't emphasize in that was how much the culture war played into how depressed I got

02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:17.080
because I was originally legal director of fire, then I became president of fire in 2005,

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:23.800
moved to Philadelphia where I get depressed. And it's just I don't have family there. There's

02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:28.760
something about the town. They don't seem to like me very much. But the main thing was being in the

02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:35.000
culture war all the time. There was a girl that I was dating. I remember, you know, she didn't seem

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.760
to really approve of what I did. And a lot of people didn't really seem to. And meanwhile,

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:43.400
like I was defending people on the left all the time. And they'd be like, oh, that's good that

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:46.440
you're defending someone on the left, but they still would never forgive me for defending someone

02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:51.720
on the right. And I remember saying at one point, I'm like, listen, I'm like, I'm a true believer in

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.480
this stuff. I'm willing to defend Nazis. I'm certainly willing to defend Republicans.

02:17:56.520 --> 02:18:03.880
And she actually said, I think Republicans might be worse. And that really shouldn't go very well.

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:08.120
And then I nearly got in fistfights a couple of times with people on the right,

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:12.520
because they found out I defended people who crack jokes about 9-11. Like this happened more

02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:19.640
than once. By the time I'm in my 20s, I'm not fistfighting again. But yeah, it was always like

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:25.240
that. You see how hypocritical people can be. You can see how friends can turn on you

02:18:25.240 --> 02:18:31.640
if they don't like your politics. So I got an early preview of this, of what the culture we're

02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:39.160
heading into by being the president of fire. And it was exhausting. And that was one of the main

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:45.080
things that led me to be suicidally depressed. At the Belmont Center, if you told me that that

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:50.120
would be the beginning of a new and better life for me, I would have laughed if I could have.

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:59.240
You can tell I'm OK if I'm still laughing. And I wasn't laughing at that point. So I got a doctor

02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:05.080
and I started doing cognitive behavioral therapy. I started having all these voices in my head that

02:19:05.080 --> 02:19:15.400
were catastrophizing and giving overgeneralization and fortune telling, mind reading, all of these

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:23.880
things that they teach you not to do. And what you do in CBT is essentially you have something

02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:29.320
makes you upset. And then you just write down what the thought was. And something minor could

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:35.960
happen in your response was, well, the date didn't seem to go very well. And that's because

02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:42.520
I'm broken and will die alone. And you're like, OK, what are the following? That's catastrophizing,

02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.320
that's mind reading, that's fortune telling, that's all this stuff. And you have to do this

02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:55.560
several times a day, forever. I actually need to brush up on it at the moment. And slowly over time,

02:19:55.560 --> 02:20:01.880
voices in my head had been saying horrible internal talk. It just didn't sound as convincing

02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:08.520
anymore, which was a really subtle effect. It was just like, oh, wait, I don't buy that I'm

02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:14.280
broken. That doesn't sound true. That doesn't sound like truth from God like it used to.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:21.240
And nine months after I was planning to kill myself, I was probably happier than I'd been in

02:20:21.240 --> 02:20:29.960
a decade. And that was one of the things that, you know, the CBT is what led me to notice this in

02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:34.680
my own work, that it felt like administrators were kind of selling cognitive distortions,

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:38.360
but students weren't buying yet. And then when I started noticing that they seemed to come in

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:41.800
actually already believing in a lot of this stuff, that it would be very dangerous. And that led to

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:47.240
coddling the American mind and all that stuff. But the thing that was rough about writing

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:51.080
canceling the American mind, and I've mentioned this already a couple of times, I got really

02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:56.360
depressed this past year because I was studying. You know, there's a friend in there that I talked

02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:00.520
about who killed himself after being canceled. I talked to him a week before he killed himself,

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:06.120
and I hadn't actually checked in with him because he seemed so confident. I thought

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:13.320
he would be totally fine because he had an insensitive tweet in June of 2020 and got forced

02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:17.080
out in a way that didn't actually sound as bad as a lot of the other professors. He actually

02:21:17.080 --> 02:21:21.240
at least got a severance package, but they knew he'd sue and win because he had before.

02:21:22.120 --> 02:21:26.360
And so I waited to check in on him because we were so overwhelmed with the request for helps.

02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:31.240
And he was saying people were coming to his house still, and then he shot himself the next week.

02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:35.960
And I definitely, and because everyone knows I'm so public about, you know, my struggles with this

02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:42.200
stuff, everybody who fights this stuff comes to me when they're having a hard time. And this is a

02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:47.480
very hard psychologically taxing business to be in. And even admitting this right now, like

02:21:48.680 --> 02:21:52.440
I think about like all the vultures out there, they'll have fun with it. Just like the same

02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:57.160
way when my friend Mike Adams killed himself, there were people celebrating on Twitter that

02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:05.640
a man was dead because they didn't like his tweets. But somehow that made them compassionate for some

02:22:05.640 --> 02:22:10.360
abstract other person. So I was getting a little depressed and anxious. And the thing that really

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:20.520
helped me more than anything else was confessing to my staff that books take a lot of energy.

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:25.160
So I knew they didn't want to hear that not only was this taking a lot of the boss's time,

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:29.720
this was making him depressed and anxious. But when I finally told the leadership of my staff,

02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:36.120
people that even though I try to maintain a lot of distance from, I love very, very much, it made

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:41.720
such a difference because I could be open about that. And the other thing was,

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:44.280
have you heard this conference dialogue? Oh, yes.

02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:50.600
It's like an invite only thing. It's Orrin Hoffman runs it. It intentionally tries to get people

02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:56.120
over the political spectrum to come together and have off the record conversations about big issues.

02:22:57.080 --> 02:23:02.840
And it was nice to be in a room where liberal conservative, none of the above were all like,

02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:08.200
oh, thank God someone's taken on cancel culture. And where it felt like, it felt like maybe

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:15.080
this won't be the disaster for me and my family that I was starting to be afraid it would be

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:19.960
that taking the stuff on might actually have a happy ending. Well, one thing I just stands out

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:31.560
from that is the pain of cancellation can be really intense. And that doesn't necessarily mean

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:37.080
losing your job, but just even you can call it bullying, you can call whatever name, but just

02:23:37.080 --> 02:23:45.160
some number of people on the internet. And that number can be small kind of saying bad things to

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:51.400
you. That can be a pretty powerful force to the human psyche, which was very surprising.

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:58.600
And then the flip side also of that, it really makes me sad how cruel people can be.

02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:06.200
Yeah. Thinking that your cause is social justice in many cases can lead people to

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:13.080
think I can be as cruel as I want in pursuit of this. A lot of times it's just a way to sort of

02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:18.520
vent some aggression on a person that you think of only as an abstraction.

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:28.760
So I think it's important for people to realize that whatever negative energy,

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:35.160
whatever negativity you want to put out there, there's real people that can get hurt. You can

02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:42.040
really get people to one, be the worst version of themselves or two, possibly take their own life.

02:24:42.040 --> 02:24:47.480
And it's not as real. Yeah. Well, that's one of the things that we do in the book.

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:54.440
To really kind of address people who still try to claim this isn't real is we just quote,

02:24:55.240 --> 02:25:00.840
we quote the Pope, we quote Obama, we quote James Carville, we quote Taylor Swift on cancel culture.

02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:07.320
And Taylor Swift's quote is essentially about how behind all of this, when it gets particularly

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:15.400
nasty, there's this very clear kill yourself kind of undercurrent to it. And it's cruel.

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.920
And the problem is that in an environment so wide open, there's always going to be someone who wants

02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:28.840
to be so transgressive and say the most hurtful, terrible thing. But then you have to remember

02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:33.880
the misrepresentation, getting back to the old idioms, sticks and stones will break my bones,

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:43.080
but names will never hurt me, has been reimagined in campus debates in the most asinine way.

02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:47.320
People will literally say stuff like, but now we know words can hurt. And it's like,

02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:53.880
now we know words can hurt. Guys, you didn't have to come up with a special little thing that you

02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:58.280
teach children to make her words hurt less if they never hurt in the first place. It wouldn't even

02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:03.960
make sense. The saying it's a saying that you repeat to yourself to give yourself strength.

02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:08.920
When the bullies have noticed you're a little weird, maybe a little personal.

02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:15.560
The and it helps. It really does help to be like, listen, okay, assholes are going to say

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:22.520
asshole things. And I can't let them have that kind of power over me. Yeah. Yeah, it still is

02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:27.480
a learning experience because it does. It does. It does hurt. But for the good people out there

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:31.320
who actually, you know, just sometimes they think that they're venting, you know, they think about

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:36.440
it. Remember that there are people on the other side of it. Yeah, for me, it hurts my kind of

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:41.960
faith in humanity. I know it shouldn't, but it does sometimes. When I just see people being cool

02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:50.520
to each other, it kind of, it's a, it floats a cloud over my perspective of the world. And that

02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:57.080
don't, I wish didn't have to be there. Yeah. That was always my sort of flippant answer to that.

02:26:57.080 --> 02:27:03.640
If mankind is basically good or basically evil being like the biggest debate in philosophy and

02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:07.560
being like, well, the problem with the first is there's nothing basic about humanity.

02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:16.120
Yeah. What gives you hope about this whole thing? About this dark state that we're in,

02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:20.120
as you describe, how can we get out? What gives you hope that we will get out?

02:27:21.160 --> 02:27:28.520
I think that people are sick of it. I think people are sick of not being able to be authentic.

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:33.240
And that's really, you know, what censorship is. It's basically telling you, don't be yourself.

02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:39.000
Don't actually say what you think. Don't show your personality. Don't dissent. Don't be weird.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:45.640
Don't be wrong. And that's not sustainable. I think that people have kind of had enough of it.

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.640
But one thing I definitely want to say to your audience is

02:27:52.360 --> 02:28:01.720
it can't just be up to us arguers to try to fix this. And I think that, and this may sound like

02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:09.960
it's an unrelated problem, I think if there were highly respected, let's say extremely difficult

02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:14.120
ways to prove that you're extremely smart and hardworking, that cost little or nothing,

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:20.600
that actually can give the Harvards and the Yales of the world a run for their money,

02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:25.160
I think that might be the most positive thing we could do to deal with a lot of these problems and

02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:32.920
why. I think the fact that we have become a weird, America with a great anti-elitist tradition

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:39.640
has become weirdly elitist in the respect that we not only, again, are our leadership coming from

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:45.160
these few fancy schools, we actually have like great admiration for them. We kind of look up to

02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:50.440
them. But I think we'd have a lot healthier of a society if people could prove, you know,

02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:55.560
their excellence in ways that are coming from completely different streams and that are highly

02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:00.600
respected. I sometimes talk about there should be a test that anyone who passes it gets like a,

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:08.440
you know, a BA in the humanities, like a super BA, like someone not a GED. That's not what I'm

02:29:08.440 --> 02:29:13.480
talking about. I'm talking about something that like, you know, one out of only a couple, like

02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:18.920
a hundred people can pass. Some other way of actually of not going through these massive,

02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:22.840
bloated expensive institutions that people can raise their hands and say, I'm smart and hard

02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:27.880
working. I think that could be an incredibly healthy way. I think we need additional streams

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:31.240
for creative people to be solving problems, whether that's on X or someplace else.

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:35.800
I think that there's lots of things that technology could do to really help with this.

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:39.960
I think some of the stuff that Sal Khan is working on at Khan Academy could really help.

02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:45.560
So I think there's a lot of ways, but they exist largely around coming up with new ways of doing

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:51.560
things, not just expecting the old things that have, say, $40 billion in the bank

02:29:52.280 --> 02:29:55.960
that they're going to reform themselves. And here's my, you know, I've been picking on

02:29:55.960 --> 02:30:01.960
Harvard a lot, but I'm going to pick on them a little bit more. And I talk a lot about class

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:07.400
again. And, you know, there's a great book called Poison Ivy by Evan Mandry, which I recommend to

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:13.560
everybody. It's outrageous. It sounds like me on a rant at Stanford, which was, and I think the

02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:18.920
stat is, you know, elite higher education has more kids from the top 1% than they have from the

02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:26.040
bottom 50 or 60%, depending on the school. And when you look at how much they actually replicate

02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:30.120
class privilege, it's really distressing. So everybody should read Poison Ivy.

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:35.480
And above all else, if you're weird, continue being weird.

02:30:37.960 --> 02:30:42.120
And you're one of the most interesting, one of the weirdest in the most beautiful way people

02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:49.720
have ever met. Greg, thank you for the really important work you do. Everybody watch Kid Cosmic.

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:57.160
I appreciate the class, the hilarity you brought here today, man. This is an amazing conversation.

02:30:57.160 --> 02:31:03.240
Thank you for the work you do. Thank you, thank you. And for me, who deeply cares about education,

02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:11.080
higher education, thank you for holding the MITs and the Harvards accountable for doing right by

02:31:11.080 --> 02:31:16.760
the people that walk their halls. So thank you so much for talking today. Thanks for listening to

02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:21.720
this conversation with Greg Lukianoff. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in

02:31:21.720 --> 02:31:27.400
the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Noam Chomsky. If you believe in

02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:33.560
freedom of speech, you believe in freedom of speech for views you don't like. Gables was in

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:39.080
favor of freedom of speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you're in favor of freedom of

02:31:39.080 --> 02:31:44.200
speech, that means you're in favor of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise.

02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:48.920
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
