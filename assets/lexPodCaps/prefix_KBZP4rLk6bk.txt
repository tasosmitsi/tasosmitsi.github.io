WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
we can actually figure out where are the aliens out there

00:02.320 --> 00:04.600
in space time by being clever about the few things

00:04.600 --> 00:07.120
we can see, one of which is our current date.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.080
And so now that you have this living cosmology,

00:10.080 --> 00:12.960
we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty

00:12.960 --> 00:15.520
and then at some point things like us appear,

00:15.520 --> 00:19.400
very primitive and then some of those stop being quiet

00:19.400 --> 00:21.760
and expand and then for a few billion years,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.560
they expand and then they meet each other

00:23.560 --> 00:26.060
and then for the next hundred billion years,

00:26.060 --> 00:28.280
they commune with each other.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.600
That is the usual models of cosmology say

00:30.600 --> 00:34.600
that in roughly a hundred, 150 billion years,

00:34.600 --> 00:36.640
the expansion of the universe will happen so much

00:36.640 --> 00:39.680
that all you'll have left is some galaxy clusters

00:39.680 --> 00:41.840
and that are sort of disconnected from each other.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.560
But before then, they will interact.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.840
There will be this community

00:45.840 --> 00:48.080
of all the grabby alien civilizations

00:48.080 --> 00:49.400
and each one of them will hear about

00:49.400 --> 00:51.920
and even meet thousands of others.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.200
And we might hope to join them someday

00:55.200 --> 00:56.960
and become part of that community.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.720
The following is a conversation with Robin Hansen,

01:01.720 --> 01:04.200
an economist at George Mason University

01:04.200 --> 01:06.800
and one of the most fascinating, wild, fearless

01:06.800 --> 01:09.360
and fun minds I've ever gotten a chance to accompany

01:09.360 --> 01:12.800
for a time in exploring questions of human nature,

01:12.800 --> 01:16.600
human civilization and alien life out there

01:16.600 --> 01:19.360
in our impossibly big universe.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.720
He is the co-author of a book titled

01:21.720 --> 01:25.360
The Elephant in the Brain, Hidden Motives in Everyday Life,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.080
The Age of M, Work, Love, and Life

01:28.080 --> 01:29.760
When Robots Rule the Earth

01:29.760 --> 01:33.000
and a fascinating recent paper I recommend

01:33.000 --> 01:35.800
on quote grabby aliens,

01:35.800 --> 01:39.280
titled If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness,

01:39.280 --> 01:41.560
Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.360
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast, support it.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.920
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.320
And now dear friends, here's Robin Hansen.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.680
You are working on a book about quote grabby aliens.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.760
This is a technical term like the Big Bang.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.080
So what are grabby aliens?

02:02.080 --> 02:07.080
Grabby aliens expand fast into the universe

02:07.080 --> 02:08.320
and they change stuff.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.480
That's the key concept.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.960
So if they were out there, we would notice.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.760
That's the key idea.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.040
So the question is, where are the grabby aliens?

02:19.080 --> 02:21.920
So Fermi's question is, where are the aliens?

02:21.920 --> 02:24.520
And we could vary that in two terms, right?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.880
Where are the quiet hard to see aliens

02:26.880 --> 02:30.160
and where are the big loud grabby aliens?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.600
So it's actually hard to say

02:32.600 --> 02:34.840
where all the quiet ones are, right?

02:34.840 --> 02:36.960
There could be a lot of them out there

02:36.960 --> 02:37.800
because they're not doing much.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.680
They're not making a big difference in the world.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.160
But the grabby aliens by definition

02:42.160 --> 02:44.040
are the ones you would see.

02:44.040 --> 02:47.160
We don't know exactly what they do with where they went,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.960
but the idea is they're in some sort of competitive world

02:49.960 --> 02:54.120
where each part of them is trying to grab more stuff

02:54.120 --> 02:56.120
and do something with it.

02:56.120 --> 03:00.560
And almost surely whatever is the most competitive thing

03:00.560 --> 03:03.280
to do with all the stuff they grab

03:03.280 --> 03:06.680
isn't to leave it alone the way it started, right?

03:06.680 --> 03:09.400
So we humans, when we go around the earth and use stuff,

03:09.400 --> 03:10.240
we change it.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.800
We would turn a forest into a farmland,

03:12.800 --> 03:14.760
turn a harbor into a city.

03:14.760 --> 03:18.080
So the idea is aliens would do something with it.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.480
And so we're not exactly sure what it would look like,

03:20.480 --> 03:21.320
but it would look different.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.280
So somewhere in the sky,

03:22.280 --> 03:25.920
we would see big spheres of different activity

03:25.920 --> 03:28.960
where things had been changed because they had been there.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.840
Expanding spheres.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.920
So as you expand,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.520
you aggressively interact and change the environment.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.680
So the word grabby versus loud,

03:37.680 --> 03:40.680
you're using them sometimes synonymously, sometimes not.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.680
Grabby to me is a little bit more aggressive.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.600
What does it mean to be loud?

03:47.600 --> 03:48.920
What does it mean to be grabby?

03:48.920 --> 03:49.880
What's the difference?

03:49.880 --> 03:51.440
And loud in what ways?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.160
Is it visual? Is it sound?

03:53.160 --> 03:55.520
Is it some other physical phenomena

03:55.520 --> 03:57.160
like gravitational waves?

03:57.160 --> 03:58.880
What are you using this kind of

03:58.880 --> 04:01.000
in a broad philosophical sense

04:01.000 --> 04:05.760
or there's a specific thing that it means to be loud

04:05.760 --> 04:07.360
in this universe of ours?

04:07.360 --> 04:09.880
My co-authors and I put together a paper

04:09.880 --> 04:12.920
with a particular mathematical model.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.440
And so we use the term grabby aliens

04:15.440 --> 04:17.640
to describe that more particular model.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.880
And the idea is it's a more particular model

04:19.880 --> 04:21.920
of the general concept of loud.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.720
So loud would just be the general idea

04:23.720 --> 04:25.880
that they would be really obvious.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.560
So grabby is the technical term,

04:27.560 --> 04:29.040
is it in the title of the paper?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.040
It's in the body.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.200
The title is actually about loud and quiet.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.040
Right, I like that.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.160
So the idea is there's,

04:35.160 --> 04:37.400
you wanna distinguish your particular model of things

04:37.400 --> 04:38.960
from the general category of things

04:38.960 --> 04:40.160
everybody else might talk about.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.520
So that's how we distinguish.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.360
The paper title is,

04:42.360 --> 04:45.160
if loud aliens explain human early-ness,

04:45.160 --> 04:47.400
quiet aliens are also rare.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.160
If life on earth,

04:49.160 --> 04:50.520
God, this is such a good abstract.

04:50.520 --> 04:53.440
If life on earth had to achieve

04:53.440 --> 04:55.400
N hard. N hard steps

04:55.400 --> 04:57.320
to reach humanity's level,

04:57.320 --> 04:59.320
then the chance of this event rose

04:59.320 --> 05:00.920
as time to the end to power.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.200
So we'll talk about power.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.960
We'll talk about linear increase.

05:03.960 --> 05:08.640
So what is the technical definition of grabby?

05:09.840 --> 05:12.600
How do you envision grabbiness?

05:12.600 --> 05:16.760
And why are, in contrast with humans,

05:16.760 --> 05:18.120
why aren't humans grabby?

05:18.120 --> 05:20.000
So like, where's that line?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.360
Is it well-definable?

05:21.360 --> 05:22.200
What is grabby?

05:22.200 --> 05:23.840
What is non-grabby?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.600
We have a mathematical model

05:25.600 --> 05:28.800
of the distribution of advanced civilizations,

05:28.800 --> 05:31.200
i.e. aliens in space and time.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.240
That model has three parameters

05:34.240 --> 05:37.360
and we can set each one of those parameters from data.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.280
And therefore we claim this is actually

05:40.280 --> 05:43.000
what we know about where they are in space-time.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.400
So the key idea is they appear at some point in space-time

05:47.560 --> 05:49.720
and then after some short delay,

05:49.720 --> 05:51.240
they start expanding

05:51.240 --> 05:53.400
and they expand at some speed.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.360
And the speed is one of those parameters.

05:55.360 --> 05:56.720
That's one of the three.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.720
And the other two parameters

05:57.720 --> 06:00.160
are about how they appear in time.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.720
That is, they appear at random places

06:02.720 --> 06:05.760
and they appear in time according to a power law.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.600
And that power law has two parameters

06:07.600 --> 06:10.120
and we can fit each of those parameters to data.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.000
And so then we can say, now we know.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.360
We know the distribution of advanced civilizations

06:15.360 --> 06:16.200
in space and time.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.400
So we are right now a new civilization

06:19.400 --> 06:21.680
and we have not yet started to expand,

06:21.680 --> 06:23.600
but plausibly we would start to do that

06:23.600 --> 06:26.880
within say 10 million years of the current moment.

06:26.880 --> 06:27.960
That's plenty of time.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.360
And 10 million years is a really short duration

06:30.360 --> 06:31.440
in the history of the universe.

06:31.480 --> 06:36.080
So we are at the moment, a sort of random sample

06:36.080 --> 06:37.320
of the kind of times

06:37.320 --> 06:39.040
at which an advanced civilization might appear

06:39.040 --> 06:41.320
because we may or may not become grabby,

06:41.320 --> 06:42.920
but if we do, we'll do it soon.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.120
And so our current date is a sample

06:45.120 --> 06:47.320
and that gives us one of the other parameters.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.000
The second parameter is the constant

06:49.000 --> 06:50.080
in front of the power law

06:50.080 --> 06:53.480
and that's arrived from our current date.

06:53.480 --> 06:58.480
So power law, what is the N in the power law?

06:59.040 --> 07:01.960
That's the more complicated thing to explain.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.800
Advanced life appeared

07:03.800 --> 07:07.360
by going through a sequence of hard steps.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.320
So starting with very simple life

07:09.320 --> 07:11.200
and here we are at the end of this process

07:11.200 --> 07:12.320
at pretty advanced life.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.720
And so we had to go through some intermediate steps

07:14.720 --> 07:17.640
such as sexual selection,

07:17.640 --> 07:20.920
photosynthesis, multicellular animals.

07:20.920 --> 07:23.680
And the idea is that each of those steps was hard.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.240
Evolution just took a long time

07:26.240 --> 07:28.160
searching in a big space of possibilities

07:28.160 --> 07:30.840
to find each of those steps.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.680
And the challenge was to achieve all of those steps

07:33.680 --> 07:36.560
by a deadline of when the planets

07:36.560 --> 07:39.360
would no longer host simple life.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.880
And so Earth has been really lucky

07:41.880 --> 07:44.880
compared to all the other billions of planets out there

07:44.880 --> 07:47.160
and that we managed to achieve all these steps

07:47.160 --> 07:50.880
in the short time of the five billion years

07:50.880 --> 07:53.920
that Earth can support simple life.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.760
So not all steps, but a lot of them

07:55.760 --> 07:57.440
because we don't know how many steps there are

07:57.440 --> 07:58.800
before you start the expansion.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.320
So these are all the steps from the birth of life

08:02.320 --> 08:05.640
to the initiation of major expansion.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.680
Right, so we're pretty sure

08:06.680 --> 08:08.400
that it would happen really soon

08:08.400 --> 08:11.560
so that it couldn't be the same sort of a hard step

08:11.560 --> 08:13.400
as the last one in terms of taking a long time.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.920
So when we look at the history of Earth,

08:16.920 --> 08:19.160
we look at the durations of the major things

08:19.160 --> 08:20.840
that have happened.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.640
That suggests that there's roughly say six hard steps

08:24.680 --> 08:27.760
that happened, say between three and 12.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.400
And that we have just achieved the last one

08:30.400 --> 08:32.400
that would take a long time.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.240
Which is?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.280
Well, we don't know.

08:35.280 --> 08:36.120
Oh, okay.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.560
But whatever it is, we've just achieved the last one.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.440
Are we talking about humans or aliens here?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.320
So let's talk about some of these steps.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.800
So Earth is really special in some way.

08:44.800 --> 08:47.800
We don't exactly know the level of specialness.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.960
We don't really know which steps were the hardest or not

08:50.960 --> 08:53.040
because we just have a sample of one.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.720
But you're saying that there's three to 12 steps

08:55.720 --> 08:58.280
that we have to go through to get to where we are

08:58.280 --> 09:00.480
that are hard steps, hard to find by something

09:00.480 --> 09:05.480
that took a long time and is unlikely.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.920
There's a lot of ways to fail.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.920
There's a lot more ways to fail than to succeed.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.480
The first step would be sort of the very simplest form

09:13.480 --> 09:14.760
of life of any sort.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.360
And then we don't know whether that first sort

09:19.360 --> 09:20.800
is the first sort that we see

09:20.800 --> 09:22.880
in the historical record or not.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.240
But then some other steps are, say,

09:24.240 --> 09:26.280
the development of photosynthesis,

09:26.280 --> 09:29.520
the development of sexual reproduction.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.200
There's the development of eukaryote cells,

09:32.200 --> 09:34.080
which are certain kind of complicated cell

09:34.080 --> 09:36.840
that seems to have only appeared once.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.880
And then there's multicellularity,

09:38.880 --> 09:40.720
that is multiple cells coming together

09:40.720 --> 09:43.200
to large organisms like us.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.680
And in the statistical model of trying to fit

09:46.680 --> 09:49.400
all these steps into a finite window,

09:49.400 --> 09:51.640
the model actually predicts that these steps

09:51.640 --> 09:53.280
could be of varying difficulties.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.600
That is, they could each take different amounts of time

09:55.600 --> 09:57.920
on average, but if you're lucky enough

09:57.920 --> 10:00.320
that they all appear at a very short time,

10:00.320 --> 10:03.600
then the durations between them will be roughly equal

10:03.600 --> 10:06.840
and the time remaining left over in the rest of the window

10:06.840 --> 10:08.400
will also be the same length.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.240
So we at the moment have roughly a billion years

10:11.240 --> 10:14.400
left on earth until simple life like us

10:14.400 --> 10:16.440
would no longer be possible.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.840
Life appeared roughly 400 million years

10:18.840 --> 10:20.880
after the very first time when life was possible

10:20.880 --> 10:22.560
at the very beginning.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
So those two numbers right there give you

10:24.560 --> 10:27.000
the rough estimate of six hard steps.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.520
Just to build up an intuition here,

10:28.520 --> 10:32.760
so we're trying to create a simple mathematical model

10:32.760 --> 10:37.760
of how life emerges and expands in the universe.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.800
And there's a section in this paper,

10:39.800 --> 10:41.840
how many hard steps, question mark.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.320
Right.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.880
The two most plausibly diagnostic earth durations

10:45.880 --> 10:47.840
seem to be the one remaining after now

10:47.840 --> 10:51.080
before earth becomes uninhabitable for complex life.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.360
So you estimate how long earth lasts,

10:54.360 --> 10:56.640
how many hard steps.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.760
There's windows for doing different hard steps

11:00.760 --> 11:04.280
and you can sort of like queuing theory mathematically

11:04.280 --> 11:09.280
estimate of like the solution or the passing

11:10.600 --> 11:13.200
of the hard steps or the taking of the hard steps.

11:13.200 --> 11:17.000
Sort of like coldly mathematical look.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
If life, pre-expansionary life requires a number of steps,

11:23.520 --> 11:26.320
what is the probability of taking those steps

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
on an earth that lasts a billion years

11:28.320 --> 11:30.160
or two billion years or five billion years

11:30.160 --> 11:31.760
or 10 billion years?

11:31.760 --> 11:36.120
And you say solving for E using the observed durations

11:36.120 --> 11:41.120
of 1.1 and 0.4 then gives E values of 3.9 and 12.5

11:42.640 --> 11:46.000
range 5.7 to 26, suggesting a middle estimate

11:46.000 --> 11:47.040
of at least six.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.000
That's what he said, six hard steps.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.840
Right.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.120
Just to get to where we are.

11:53.120 --> 11:53.960
Right.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.400
We started at the bottom, now we're here

11:55.400 --> 11:57.760
and that took six steps on average.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.000
The key point is on average these things

12:01.000 --> 12:04.200
on any one random planet would take trillions

12:04.200 --> 12:07.880
or trillions of years, just a really long time.

12:07.880 --> 12:10.080
And so we're really lucky that they all happened

12:10.080 --> 12:14.000
really fast in a short time before our window closed

12:14.000 --> 12:17.400
and the chance of that happening in that short window

12:17.400 --> 12:19.720
goes as that time period to the power

12:19.720 --> 12:20.680
of the number of steps.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.720
And so that was where the power we talked about

12:22.720 --> 12:24.240
before it came from.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.480
And so that means in the history of the universe,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.080
we should overall roughly expect advanced life

12:30.080 --> 12:32.440
to appear as a power law in time.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.840
So that very early on there was very little chance

12:35.840 --> 12:37.560
of anything appearing and then later on

12:37.560 --> 12:39.640
as things appear, other things are appearing

12:39.640 --> 12:41.760
somewhat closer to them in time

12:41.760 --> 12:44.240
because they're all going as this power law.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.840
What is the power law?

12:45.840 --> 12:48.760
Can we, for people who are not sure math inclined,

12:48.760 --> 12:49.960
can you describe what a power law is?

12:49.960 --> 12:53.200
So say the function X is linear

12:53.200 --> 12:55.520
and X squared is quadratic.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.200
So it's the power of two.

12:57.200 --> 13:01.440
If we make X to the three, that's cubic or the power of three.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.000
And so X to the sixth is the power of six.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.720
And so we'd say life appears in the universe

13:08.720 --> 13:11.400
on a planet like earth in that proportion

13:12.240 --> 13:17.240
to the time that it's been ready for life to appear.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.160
And that over the universe in general,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.160
it'll appear at roughly a power law like that.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.000
What is the X mark?

13:25.000 --> 13:25.840
What is N?

13:26.680 --> 13:27.800
Is it the number of hard steps?

13:27.800 --> 13:29.400
Yes, the number of hard steps.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.240
So that's the idea.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.760
Okay, so it's like if you're gambling

13:32.760 --> 13:34.680
and you're doubling up every time,

13:34.680 --> 13:37.280
this is the probability of you just keep winning.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.280
So it gets very unlikely, very quickly.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.240
And so we're the result of this unlikely chain of successes.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.760
It's actually a lot like cancer.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.080
So the dominant model of cancer in an organism

13:51.080 --> 13:53.840
like each of us is that we have all these cells

13:53.840 --> 13:55.600
and in order to become cancerous,

13:55.600 --> 13:58.960
a single cell has to go through a number of mutations

13:58.960 --> 14:00.800
and these are very unlikely mutations.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.560
And so any one cell is very unlikely

14:02.560 --> 14:04.680
to have all these mutations happen

14:04.680 --> 14:06.880
by the time your lifespan's over.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.160
But we have enough cells in our body

14:09.160 --> 14:11.760
that the chance of any one cell producing cancer

14:11.760 --> 14:13.440
by the end of your life is actually pretty high,

14:13.440 --> 14:15.360
more like 40%.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.560
And so the chance of cancer appearing

14:17.560 --> 14:19.560
in your lifetime also goes as a power law.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.440
This power of the number of mutations that's required

14:22.440 --> 14:24.560
for any one cell in your body to become cancerous.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.360
So the longer you live,

14:26.360 --> 14:29.240
the likely you are to have cancer cells.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.000
And the power is also roughly six.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.720
That is the chance of you getting cancer

14:33.720 --> 14:36.760
is roughly the power of six of the time

14:36.760 --> 14:37.840
you've been since you were born.

14:37.840 --> 14:42.840
It is perhaps not lost on people that you're comparing

14:43.280 --> 14:46.680
power laws of the survival or the arrival

14:46.680 --> 14:50.400
of the human species to cancerous cells.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.720
The same mathematical model,

14:51.720 --> 14:55.200
but of course we might have a different value assumption

14:55.200 --> 14:56.560
about the two outcomes.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.640
But of course, from the point of view of cancer,

14:58.640 --> 15:01.840
it's more similar.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.080
From the point of view of cancer, it's a win-win.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.040
We both get to thrive, I suppose.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.280
It is interesting to take the point of view

15:11.280 --> 15:13.440
of all kinds of life forms on earth,

15:13.440 --> 15:15.320
of viruses, of bacteria.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.040
They have a very different view.

15:18.360 --> 15:22.640
It's like the Instagram channel, nature is metal.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.160
The ethic under which nature operates

15:25.160 --> 15:30.160
doesn't often coincide, correlate with human morals.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.960
It seems cold and machine-like

15:34.960 --> 15:37.400
in the selection process that it performs.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.320
I am an analyst, I'm a scholar, an intellectual,

15:41.320 --> 15:44.520
and I feel I should carefully distinguish

15:44.520 --> 15:47.120
predicting what's likely to happen

15:47.120 --> 15:49.440
and then evaluating or judging

15:49.440 --> 15:51.760
what I think would be better to happen.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.560
And it's a little dangerous to mix those up too closely

15:54.560 --> 15:57.760
because then we can have wishful thinking.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.080
And so I try typically to just analyze

16:01.080 --> 16:02.400
what seems likely to happen,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.240
regardless of whether I like it

16:04.240 --> 16:05.840
or whether we do anything about it.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.080
And then once you see a rough picture

16:08.080 --> 16:10.520
of what's likely to happen if we do nothing,

16:10.520 --> 16:12.920
then we can ask, well, what might we prefer?

16:12.920 --> 16:15.400
And ask, where could the levers be to move it

16:15.400 --> 16:17.880
at least a little toward what we might prefer?

16:17.880 --> 16:19.440
It's kind of a useful app,

16:19.440 --> 16:21.640
but often doing that just analysis

16:21.640 --> 16:24.280
of what's likely to happen if we do nothing

16:24.280 --> 16:25.920
offends many people.

16:25.960 --> 16:30.720
They find that dehumanizing or cold or metal, as you say,

16:30.720 --> 16:33.240
to just say, well, this is what's likely to happen.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.320
And it's not your favorite, sorry,

16:36.320 --> 16:38.760
but maybe we can do something,

16:38.760 --> 16:41.040
but maybe we can't do that much.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.440
This is very interesting that the cold analysis,

16:46.440 --> 16:50.480
whether it's geopolitics, whether it's medicine,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.960
whether it's economics,

16:53.000 --> 16:57.160
sometimes misses some very specific aspect

16:57.160 --> 17:02.040
of human condition.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.560
Like, for example, when you look at a doctor

17:05.560 --> 17:09.160
and the act of a doctor helping a single patient,

17:09.160 --> 17:12.480
if you do the analysis of that doctor's time

17:12.480 --> 17:14.920
and cost of the medicine or the surgery

17:14.920 --> 17:17.160
or the transportation of the patient,

17:17.160 --> 17:18.880
this is the Paul Farmer question.

17:19.880 --> 17:24.880
Is it worth spending 10, 20, $30,000 on this one patient?

17:25.080 --> 17:26.480
When you look at all the people

17:26.480 --> 17:27.480
that are suffering in the world,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.760
that money could be spent so much better.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.280
And yet, there's something about human nature

17:34.800 --> 17:37.680
that wants to help the person in front of you,

17:37.680 --> 17:40.600
and that is actually the right thing to do

17:40.600 --> 17:42.880
despite the analysis.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.080
And sometimes when you do the analysis,

17:46.480 --> 17:47.840
there's something about the human mind

17:47.840 --> 17:50.320
that allows you to not take that leap,

17:50.320 --> 17:55.040
that irrational leap to act in this way,

17:55.040 --> 17:57.240
that the analysis explains it away.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.920
Well, it's like, for example, the US government,

18:01.920 --> 18:04.440
the DOT, Department of Transportation,

18:04.440 --> 18:09.320
puts a value of, I think, like $9 million on a human life.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.720
And the moment you put that number on a human life,

18:11.720 --> 18:13.560
you can start thinking, well, okay,

18:13.560 --> 18:16.520
I can start making decisions about this or that

18:16.800 --> 18:20.400
with a sort of cold economic perspective,

18:20.400 --> 18:22.000
and then you might lose,

18:22.960 --> 18:25.920
you might deviate from a deeper truth

18:25.920 --> 18:28.280
of what it means to be human somehow.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.600
So you have to dance,

18:29.600 --> 18:32.320
because then if you put too much weight

18:32.320 --> 18:36.920
on the anecdotal evidence on these kinds of human emotions,

18:36.920 --> 18:39.160
then you're going to lose,

18:39.160 --> 18:43.040
you could also probably more likely deviate from truth.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.480
But there's something about that cold analysis.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.240
Like I've been listening to a lot of people

18:47.240 --> 18:52.240
coldly analyze wars, war in Yemen, war in Syria,

18:52.880 --> 18:56.440
Israel, Palestine, war in Ukraine,

18:56.440 --> 18:59.160
and there's something lost when you do a cold analysis

18:59.160 --> 19:00.800
of why something happened.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.360
When you talk about energy,

19:04.120 --> 19:07.680
talking about sort of conflict, competition over resources,

19:07.680 --> 19:11.400
when you talk about geopolitics,

19:11.400 --> 19:14.600
sort of models of geopolitics of why a certain war happened,

19:14.600 --> 19:18.160
you lose something about the suffering that happens.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.160
I don't know.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.880
It's an interesting thing because you're both,

19:20.880 --> 19:25.880
you're exceptionally good at models in all domains,

19:26.640 --> 19:31.240
literally, but also there's a humanity to you.

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
So it's an interesting dance.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.040
I don't know if you can comment on that dance.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.200
Sure.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.520
It's definitely true as you say,

19:37.520 --> 19:39.360
that for many people,

19:39.360 --> 19:42.200
if you are accurate in your judgment of say,

19:42.200 --> 19:44.040
for a medical patient, right?

19:44.040 --> 19:47.720
What's the chance that this treatment might help

19:47.720 --> 19:51.640
and what's the cost and compare those to each other.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.760
And you might say,

19:53.960 --> 19:57.680
this looks like a lot of cost for a small medical gain.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.600
And at that point, knowing that fact,

20:01.600 --> 20:05.760
that might take the wing, the air out of your sails.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.560
You might not be willing to do the thing

20:08.560 --> 20:10.720
that maybe you feel is right anyway,

20:10.720 --> 20:12.360
which is still to pay for it.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.000
And then somebody knowing that

20:16.000 --> 20:17.560
might wanna keep that news from you,

20:17.560 --> 20:20.040
not tell you about the low chance of success

20:20.040 --> 20:23.560
or the high cost in order to save you this tension,

20:23.560 --> 20:26.760
this awkward moment where you might fail to do

20:26.760 --> 20:28.600
what they and you think is right.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.560
But I think the higher calling,

20:32.560 --> 20:34.880
the higher standard to hold you to,

20:34.880 --> 20:38.640
which many people can be held to is to say,

20:38.640 --> 20:41.400
I will look at things accurately, I will know the truth,

20:41.400 --> 20:45.040
and then I will also do the right thing with it.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.040
I will be at peace with my judgment

20:47.040 --> 20:49.240
about what the right thing is in terms of the truth.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.680
I don't need to be lied to in order to figure out

20:52.680 --> 20:54.440
what the right thing to do is.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.680
And I think if you do think you need to be lied to

20:56.680 --> 20:59.720
in order to figure out what the right thing to do is,

20:59.720 --> 21:01.000
you're at a great disadvantage

21:01.000 --> 21:03.440
because then people will be lying to,

21:03.440 --> 21:04.920
you will be lying to yourself

21:04.920 --> 21:08.080
and you won't be as effective

21:09.040 --> 21:11.440
achieving whatever good you were trying to achieve.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.760
But getting the data, getting the facts is step one,

21:14.760 --> 21:15.880
not the final step.

21:15.880 --> 21:16.920
Absolutely.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.040
So it's, I would say having a good model,

21:20.040 --> 21:23.680
getting the good data is step one and it's a burden

21:24.800 --> 21:28.360
because you can't just use that data

21:28.360 --> 21:33.360
to arrive at sort of the easy, convenient thing.

21:33.440 --> 21:34.880
You have to really deeply think

21:34.880 --> 21:37.000
about what is the right thing.

21:37.040 --> 21:41.280
You can't use the, so the dark aspect of data,

21:41.280 --> 21:46.280
of models is you can use it to excuse away actions

21:48.040 --> 21:49.520
that aren't ethical.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.360
You can use data to basically excuse away anything.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.760
But not looking at data lets you excuse yourself

21:55.760 --> 21:59.120
to pretend and think that you're doing good when you're not.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.600
Exactly.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.840
But it is a burden.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.040
It doesn't excuse you from still being human

22:05.080 --> 22:07.560
and deeply thinking about what is right,

22:07.560 --> 22:11.160
that very kind of gray area, that very subjective area.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.240
That's part of the human condition.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.320
But let us return for a time to aliens.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.640
So you started to define sort of the model,

22:21.640 --> 22:25.240
the parameters of grabbiness.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.080
Right.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.280
Or the, as we approach grabbiness.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.440
So what happens?

22:29.440 --> 22:31.160
So again, there was three parameters.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.080
Yes.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.320
There's the speed at which they expand.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.440
There's the rate at which they appear in time.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.840
And that rate has a constant and a power.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.440
So we've talked about the history of life

22:41.440 --> 22:43.600
when our suggest that power is around six,

22:43.600 --> 22:45.560
but maybe three to 12.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.440
We can say that constant comes from our current date,

22:48.440 --> 22:50.560
sort of sets the overall rate.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.280
And the speed, which is the last parameter,

22:53.280 --> 22:55.200
comes from the fact that we look in the sky,

22:55.200 --> 22:56.400
we don't see them.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.400
So the model predicts very strongly

22:58.400 --> 22:59.880
that if they were expanding slowly,

22:59.880 --> 23:02.000
say 1% of the speed of light,

23:02.040 --> 23:04.840
our sky would be full of vast spheres

23:04.840 --> 23:06.680
that were full of activity.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.920
That is, at a random time when a civilization

23:09.920 --> 23:12.440
is first appearing, if it looks out into its sky,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.240
it would see many other grabby alien civilizations

23:15.240 --> 23:16.360
in the sky, and they would be much bigger

23:16.360 --> 23:17.200
than the full moon.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.600
They'd be huge spheres in the sky,

23:18.600 --> 23:20.480
and they would be visibly different.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.360
We don't see them.

23:21.360 --> 23:22.480
Can we pause for a second?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.320
Okay.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.720
There's a bunch of hard steps that Earth had to pass

23:27.720 --> 23:30.280
to arrive at this place we are currently,

23:30.280 --> 23:33.200
which we're starting to launch rockets out into space.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.840
We're kind of starting to expand.

23:34.840 --> 23:35.800
A bit, right.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.680
Very slowly, okay.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.680
But this is like the birth.

23:39.680 --> 23:43.240
If you look at the entirety of the history of Earth,

23:43.240 --> 23:46.720
we're now at this precipice of expansion.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.200
We could, we might not choose to,

23:48.200 --> 23:51.880
but if we do, we will do it in the next 10 million years.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.480
10 million, wow.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.680
Time flies when you're having fun.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.440
10 million is a short time on the cosmological scale.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.160
So that is, it might be only 1,000,

24:01.080 --> 24:02.240
even if it's up to 10 million,

24:02.240 --> 24:03.880
that hardly makes any difference to the model.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.560
So I might as well give you 10 million.

24:05.560 --> 24:09.480
This makes me feel, I was so stressed about planning

24:09.480 --> 24:11.160
what I'm gonna do today, and now-

24:11.160 --> 24:12.360
Right, you got plenty of time.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.520
Plenty of time.

24:14.560 --> 24:17.320
Just need to be generating some offspring quickly here.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.160
Okay.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.560
So, and there's this moment,

24:23.240 --> 24:28.200
this 10 million year gap or window when we start expanding,

24:28.200 --> 24:31.560
and you're saying, okay, so this is an interesting moment

24:31.560 --> 24:33.920
where there's a bunch of other alien civilizations

24:33.920 --> 24:36.360
that might, at some history of the universe,

24:36.360 --> 24:38.160
arrived at this moment we're here.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.760
They passed all the hard steps.

24:39.760 --> 24:44.080
There's a model for how likely it is that that happens,

24:44.080 --> 24:45.640
and then they start expanding.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.760
And you think of an expansion as almost like a sphere.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.600
Right.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.840
That's, when you say speed,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.880
we're talking about the speed of the radius growth.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.560
Exactly, the surface, how fast the surface expands.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.600
Okay, and so you're saying that there is some speed

24:59.600 --> 25:01.560
for that expansion, average speed,

25:01.560 --> 25:04.520
and then we can play with that parameter,

25:04.520 --> 25:07.280
and if that speed is super slow,

25:07.280 --> 25:10.680
then maybe that explains why we haven't seen anything.

25:10.680 --> 25:11.720
If it's super fast-

25:11.720 --> 25:14.240
Well, it would be, if the slow would create the puzzle,

25:14.240 --> 25:16.720
if slow predicts we would see them, but we don't see them.

25:16.720 --> 25:17.560
Okay, perfect.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.120
And so the way to explain that is that they're fast.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.000
So the idea is, if they're moving really fast,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.120
then we don't see them until they're almost here.

25:25.360 --> 25:26.600
Okay, this is counter-intuitive.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.720
All right, hold on a second.

25:27.720 --> 25:31.120
So I think this works best when I say a bunch of dumb things.

25:31.120 --> 25:31.960
Okay.

25:33.200 --> 25:37.680
And then you elucidate the full complexity

25:37.680 --> 25:39.200
and the beauty of the dumbness.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.720
Okay.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.560
So there's these spheres out there in the universe

25:44.560 --> 25:47.200
that are made visible because they're sort of

25:47.200 --> 25:48.600
using a lot of energy,

25:48.600 --> 25:49.640
so they're generating a lot of light.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.480
Light stuff, they're changing things.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.320
They're changing things.

25:52.320 --> 25:56.720
Change would be visible a long way off.

25:56.720 --> 25:57.880
They would take apart stars,

25:57.880 --> 25:59.960
rearrange them, restructure galaxies.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.600
They would do big, huge stuff.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.080
Okay, if they're expanding slowly,

26:06.080 --> 26:09.880
we would see a lot of them because the universe is old,

26:09.880 --> 26:12.840
is old enough to where we would see the expansion.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.080
We're assuming we're just typical,

26:15.080 --> 26:16.840
maybe at the 50th percentile of them.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.840
So like half of them have appeared so far,

26:18.840 --> 26:20.800
the other half will still appear later.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.280
And the math of our best estimate is that

26:26.280 --> 26:28.880
they appear roughly once per million galaxies

26:30.120 --> 26:33.160
and we would meet them in roughly a billion years

26:33.160 --> 26:35.600
if we expanded out to meet them.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.840
So we're looking at a grabby aliens model, 3D sim, right?

26:39.840 --> 26:42.520
What's, that's the actual name of the video.

26:42.520 --> 26:47.520
What, by the time we get to 13.8 billion years,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.800
the fun begins.

26:49.880 --> 26:54.440
Okay, so this is, we're watching a three dimensional

26:54.440 --> 26:57.520
sphere rotating, I presume that's the universe

26:57.520 --> 26:59.560
and then grabby aliens are expanding

26:59.560 --> 27:04.160
and filling that universe with all kinds of fun.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.560
Pretty soon it's all full.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.400
It's full.

27:06.400 --> 27:11.400
So that's how the grabby aliens come in contact,

27:11.440 --> 27:16.440
first of all with other aliens and then with us humans.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.760
The following is a simulation of the grabby aliens model

27:18.760 --> 27:20.320
of alien civilizations.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.360
Civilizations are born and expand outwards

27:23.360 --> 27:24.680
at constant speed.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.080
A spherical region of space is shown.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.200
By the time we get to 13.8 billion years,

27:30.200 --> 27:33.840
this sphere will be about 3,000 times as wide

27:33.840 --> 27:37.560
as the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.000
Okay, this is fun.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.840
It's huge.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.680
Okay, it's huge.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.600
All right, so why don't we see,

27:46.560 --> 27:49.120
we're one little tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny dot

27:49.120 --> 27:50.760
in that giant, giant sphere.

27:50.760 --> 27:51.600
Right.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.480
Why don't we see any of the grabby aliens?

27:55.320 --> 27:57.480
It depends on how fast they expand.

27:57.480 --> 27:59.160
So you could see that if they expanded

27:59.160 --> 28:01.400
at the speed of light, you wouldn't see them

28:01.400 --> 28:03.200
until they were here.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.440
So like out there, if somebody is destroying the universe

28:05.440 --> 28:10.440
with a vacuum decay, there's this doomsday scenario

28:10.720 --> 28:13.800
where somebody somewhere could change the vacuum

28:13.800 --> 28:15.160
of the universe and that would expand

28:15.160 --> 28:16.640
at the speed of light and basically destroy

28:16.640 --> 28:17.480
everything it hit.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.280
But you'd never see that until it got here

28:19.280 --> 28:21.480
because it's expanding at the speed of light.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.640
If you're expanding really slow,

28:22.640 --> 28:24.400
then you see it from a long way off.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.680
So the fact we don't see anything in the sky

28:26.680 --> 28:28.760
tells us they're expanding fast,

28:28.760 --> 28:30.720
say over a third the speed of light.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.480
And that's really, really fast.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.120
But that's what you have to believe

28:35.120 --> 28:37.640
if you look out and you don't see anything.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.960
Now you might say, well, how,

28:38.960 --> 28:40.520
maybe I just don't wanna believe this whole model.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.520
Why should I believe this whole model at all?

28:42.560 --> 28:46.000
And our best evidence why you should believe this model

28:46.000 --> 28:47.240
is our early date.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.480
We are right now at almost 14 billion years

28:51.480 --> 28:55.240
into the universe on a planet around a star

28:55.240 --> 28:57.280
that's roughly 5 billion years old.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.840
But the average star out there

29:00.840 --> 29:04.040
will last roughly 5 trillion years.

29:04.040 --> 29:07.000
That is a thousand times longer.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.600
And remember that power law,

29:08.600 --> 29:10.560
it says that the chance of advanced life

29:10.560 --> 29:13.160
appearing on a planet goes as the power of sixth

29:13.160 --> 29:14.000
of the time.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.200
So if a planet lasts a thousand times longer,

29:17.200 --> 29:20.160
then the chance of it appearing on that planet,

29:20.160 --> 29:21.800
if everything would stay empty at least,

29:21.800 --> 29:25.240
is a thousand to the sixth power or 10 to the 18.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.960
So enormous, overwhelming chance

29:28.960 --> 29:30.480
that if the universe would just say,

29:30.480 --> 29:33.040
sit and empty and waiting for advanced life to appear,

29:33.040 --> 29:36.560
when it would appear would be way at the end

29:36.560 --> 29:39.200
of all these planet lifetimes.

29:39.200 --> 29:42.240
That is the long planets near the end of the lifetime,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.160
trillions of years into the future.

29:44.160 --> 29:46.480
So, but we're really early compared to that.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.440
And our explanation is at the moment,

29:48.440 --> 29:49.480
as you saw in the video,

29:49.480 --> 29:51.880
the universe is filling up in roughly a billion years,

29:51.880 --> 29:52.960
it'll all be full.

29:52.960 --> 29:53.800
And at that point,

29:53.800 --> 29:55.800
it's too late for advanced life to show up.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.960
So you had to show up now before that deadline.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.280
Okay, can we break that apart a little bit?

30:00.280 --> 30:03.160
Okay, or linger on some of the things you said.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.720
So with the power law,

30:04.720 --> 30:07.040
the things we've done on earth,

30:07.040 --> 30:10.520
the model you have says that it's very unlikely,

30:10.520 --> 30:13.280
like we're lucky SOBs.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.440
Is that mathematically correct to say?

30:16.880 --> 30:18.480
We're crazy early.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.400
That is when early means like-

30:20.400 --> 30:21.760
In the history of the universe.

30:21.760 --> 30:26.480
In the history, okay, so given this model,

30:27.360 --> 30:28.840
how do we make sense of that?

30:28.840 --> 30:31.800
If we're super, can we just be the lucky ones?

30:31.800 --> 30:34.040
Well, 10 to the 18 lucky, you know,

30:34.040 --> 30:35.160
how lucky do you feel?

30:36.040 --> 30:39.880
So, you know, that's a pretty lucky, right?

30:39.880 --> 30:41.720
10 to the 18 is a billion, billion.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.120
So then if you were just being honest and humble,

30:46.120 --> 30:49.000
that that means, what does that mean?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
It means one of the assumptions that calculated this

30:51.000 --> 30:52.840
crazy early must be wrong.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.680
That's what it means.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.360
So the key assumption we suggest

30:55.360 --> 30:57.840
is that the universe would stay empty.

30:57.840 --> 31:02.040
So most life would appear like a thousand times longer

31:02.040 --> 31:04.760
later than now, if everything would stay empty

31:05.320 --> 31:06.480
and we're waiting for it to appear.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.280
So what is non-empty?

31:08.280 --> 31:10.640
So the grabby aliens are filling the universe right now.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.120
Roughly at the moment, they filled half of the universe

31:13.120 --> 31:14.280
and they've changed it.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.640
And when they fill everything,

31:15.640 --> 31:17.400
it's too late for stuff like us to appear.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.760
But wait, hold on a second.

31:20.360 --> 31:23.040
Did anyone help us get lucky?

31:23.040 --> 31:26.360
If it's so difficult, how do-

31:26.360 --> 31:28.240
So it's like cancer, right?

31:28.240 --> 31:30.640
There's all these cells, each of which randomly

31:30.640 --> 31:32.360
does or doesn't get cancer.

31:32.360 --> 31:34.360
And eventually some cell gets cancer

31:35.000 --> 31:36.400
and we were one of those.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.880
But hold on a second.

31:38.880 --> 31:41.760
Okay, but we got it early.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.040
Early compared to the prediction

31:44.040 --> 31:46.200
with an assumption that's wrong.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.480
So that's how we do a lot of theoretical analysis.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.360
You have a model that makes a prediction that's wrong,

31:51.360 --> 31:53.760
then that helps you reject that model.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.400
Let's try to understand exactly where the wrong is.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.560
So the assumption is that the universe is empty.

31:59.560 --> 32:00.400
Stays empty.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.320
Stays empty.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.120
And waits until this advanced life appears

32:04.760 --> 32:05.800
in trillions of years.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.440
That is, if the universe would just stay empty,

32:07.440 --> 32:10.800
if there was just nobody else out there,

32:10.800 --> 32:14.120
then when you should expect advanced life to appear,

32:14.120 --> 32:15.280
if you're the only one in the universe,

32:15.280 --> 32:16.520
when should you expect to appear?

32:16.520 --> 32:18.360
You should expect to appear trillions of years

32:18.360 --> 32:19.600
in the future.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.680
I see, right, right.

32:20.680 --> 32:24.920
So this is a very sort of nuanced mathematical assumption.

32:24.920 --> 32:29.360
I don't think we can intuit it cleanly with words.

32:29.400 --> 32:34.400
But if you assume that the universe stays empty

32:34.520 --> 32:39.520
and you're waiting for one life civilization to pop up,

32:40.720 --> 32:44.960
then it should happen very late, much later than now.

32:44.960 --> 32:49.280
And if you look at Earth, the way things happen on Earth,

32:49.280 --> 32:51.760
it happened much, much, much, much, much earlier

32:51.760 --> 32:53.560
than it was supposed to, according to this model,

32:53.560 --> 32:55.400
if you take the initial assumption.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.120
Therefore, you can say, well, the initial assumption

32:58.120 --> 33:00.760
of the universe staying empty is very unlikely.

33:00.760 --> 33:04.360
Right, and the other alternative theory

33:04.360 --> 33:07.200
is the universe is filling up and will fill up soon.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.000
And so we are typical for the origin date

33:10.000 --> 33:12.400
of things that can appear before the deadline.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.880
Before the deadline, okay, it's filling up.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.400
So why don't we see anything if it's filling up?

33:16.400 --> 33:19.080
Because they're expanding really fast.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.680
Close to the speed of light, exactly.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.400
So we will only see it when it's here.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.240
Almost here.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.640
Okay.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.320
What are the ways in which we might see

33:28.320 --> 33:29.840
a quickly expanding?

33:31.080 --> 33:32.800
This is both exciting and terrifying.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.640
It is terrifying.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.360
It's like watching a truck driving at you

33:36.360 --> 33:37.800
at 100 miles an hour.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.760
Right, so we would see spheres in the sky,

33:41.760 --> 33:45.600
at least one sphere in the sky, growing very rapidly,

33:45.600 --> 33:49.240
and very rapidly, right?

33:49.240 --> 33:50.440
Yes, very rapidly.

33:50.960 --> 33:54.200
So we're not, so there's different,

33:54.200 --> 33:56.600
because we were just talking about 10 million years.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.640
This would be...

33:57.640 --> 34:00.480
You might see it 10 million years in advance coming.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.560
I mean, you still might have a long warning.

34:02.560 --> 34:06.000
Again, the universe is 14 billion years old.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.200
The typical origin times of these things

34:08.200 --> 34:09.960
are spread over several billion years.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.400
So the chance of one originating very close to you

34:13.400 --> 34:14.720
in time is very low.

34:14.720 --> 34:18.360
So it still might take millions of years

34:18.440 --> 34:21.520
from the time you see it, from the time it gets here.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.680
You'll have millions of years to be terrified

34:23.680 --> 34:25.480
of this sphere coming at you.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.240
But coming at you very fast.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.360
So if they're traveling close to the speed of light.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.360
But they're coming from a long way away.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.600
So remember, the rate at which they appear

34:33.600 --> 34:36.040
is one per million galaxies.

34:36.040 --> 34:36.880
Right.

34:36.880 --> 34:40.160
So they're roughly 100 galaxies away.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.640
I see, so the delta between the speed of light

34:43.640 --> 34:46.760
and their actual travel speed is very important.

34:46.760 --> 34:49.520
Right, so if they're going at say half the speed of light.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.000
We'll have a long time then, yeah.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.760
But what if they're traveling exactly at a speed of light?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.200
Then we see them like...

34:56.200 --> 34:57.280
Then we wouldn't have much warning,

34:57.280 --> 34:58.480
but that's less likely.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.800
Well, we can't exclude it.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.720
And they could also be somehow traveling

35:02.720 --> 35:04.840
faster than the speed of light.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.400
Well, I think we can't exclude.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.480
Because if they could go faster than the speed of light,

35:08.480 --> 35:11.000
then they would just already be everywhere.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.160
So in a universe where you can travel faster

35:13.160 --> 35:15.640
than the speed of light, you can go backwards in space time.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.840
So any time you appeared anywhere in space time,

35:17.840 --> 35:19.640
you could just fill up everything.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.320
Yeah, and...

35:21.320 --> 35:23.080
So anybody in the future, whoever appeared,

35:23.080 --> 35:24.800
they would have been here by now.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.360
Can you exclude the possibility

35:26.360 --> 35:28.760
that those kinds of aliens aren't already here?

35:30.640 --> 35:33.080
Well, we should have a different discussion of that.

35:33.080 --> 35:33.920
Right, so...

35:33.920 --> 35:36.200
Well, let's actually leave that discussion aside

35:36.200 --> 35:39.760
just to linger and understand the grabby alien expansion,

35:39.760 --> 35:42.240
which is beautiful and fascinating.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.080
Okay.

35:44.120 --> 35:48.240
So there's these giant expanding spheres

35:48.240 --> 35:49.920
of alien civilizations.

35:49.920 --> 35:54.920
Now, when those spheres collide,

35:56.040 --> 36:01.040
mathematically, it's very likely

36:01.280 --> 36:04.040
that we're not the first collision

36:04.040 --> 36:07.400
of alien civilizations.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.520
I suppose there's one way to say it.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.680
So the first time these spheres touch each other,

36:12.680 --> 36:14.640
recognize each other, they meet.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.080
They recognize each other first before they meet.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
They see each other coming.

36:21.000 --> 36:21.880
They see each other coming.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.840
And then, so there's a bunch of them.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.360
There's a combinatorial thing

36:25.360 --> 36:26.880
where they start seeing each other coming.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.240
And then there's a third neighbor.

36:28.240 --> 36:29.200
It's like, what the hell?

36:29.200 --> 36:30.480
Then there's a fourth one.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.600
Okay, so what does that, you think, look like?

36:33.600 --> 36:37.320
What lessons from human nature

36:37.320 --> 36:39.200
that's the only data we have?

36:40.360 --> 36:41.200
Can you draw up-

36:41.200 --> 36:43.680
So the story of the history of the universe here

36:43.680 --> 36:45.720
is what I would call a living cosmology.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.400
So what I'm excited about in part by this model

36:49.400 --> 36:52.040
is that it lets us tell a story of cosmology

36:52.040 --> 36:54.840
where there are actors who have agendas.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.880
So most ancient peoples, they had cosmologies,

36:57.880 --> 36:59.960
the stories they told about where the universe came from

36:59.960 --> 37:01.520
and where it's going and what's happening out there.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.320
And there are stories they like to have agents

37:03.320 --> 37:05.720
and actors, gods or something out there doing things.

37:05.720 --> 37:09.480
And lately, our favorite cosmology is dead.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.000
Kind of boring.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.320
We're the only activity we know about or see

37:13.320 --> 37:15.840
and everything else just looks dead and empty.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.800
But this is now telling us, no, that's not quite right.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.280
At the moment, the universe is filling up

37:21.280 --> 37:24.760
and in a few billion years, it'll be all full.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.760
And from then on, the history of the universe

37:26.760 --> 37:29.920
will be the universe full of aliens.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.560
Yeah, so that's a really good reminder,

37:32.560 --> 37:34.400
a really good way to think about cosmology

37:35.320 --> 37:37.680
is we're surrounded by a vast darkness

37:37.680 --> 37:40.800
and we don't know what's going on in that darkness

37:40.800 --> 37:45.720
until the light from whatever generate lights arrives here.

37:45.720 --> 37:48.240
So we kind of, yeah, we look up at the sky,

37:48.240 --> 37:50.320
okay, there's stars, oh, they're pretty,

37:50.320 --> 37:55.320
but you don't think about the giant expanding spheres

37:55.360 --> 37:58.040
of aliens, right, because you don't see them.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.840
But now our date, looking at the clock,

38:00.840 --> 38:02.200
if you're clever, the clock tells you.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.080
So I like the analogy with the ancient Greeks.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.160
You might think that an ancient Greek,

38:07.160 --> 38:09.480
staring at the universe, couldn't possibly tell

38:09.480 --> 38:12.280
how far away the sun was or how far away the moon is

38:12.280 --> 38:14.880
or how big the earth is, that all you can see

38:14.880 --> 38:16.840
is just big things in the sky you can't tell.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.200
But they were clever enough, actually,

38:18.200 --> 38:20.520
to be able to figure out the size of the earth

38:20.520 --> 38:22.000
and the distance to the moon and the sun

38:22.000 --> 38:24.560
and the size of the moon and sun.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.800
That is, they could figure those things out, actually,

38:26.800 --> 38:27.800
by being clever enough.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.800
And so similarly, we can actually figure out

38:29.800 --> 38:31.680
where are the aliens out there in space time

38:31.680 --> 38:33.880
by being clever about the few things we can see.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.720
One of which is our current date.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.680
And so now that you have this living cosmology,

38:38.680 --> 38:41.560
we can tell the story that the universe starts out empty

38:41.560 --> 38:44.120
and then at some point, things like us appear,

38:44.120 --> 38:46.840
very primitive, and then some of those

38:46.840 --> 38:49.040
just stop being quiet and expand.

38:49.040 --> 38:50.960
And then for a few billion years, they expand

38:50.960 --> 38:52.160
and then they meet each other.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.680
And then for the next 100 billion years,

38:54.680 --> 38:56.920
they commune with each other.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.160
That is, the usual models of cosmology say

38:59.160 --> 39:03.160
that in roughly 100, 150 billion years,

39:03.200 --> 39:05.240
the expansion of the universe will happen so much

39:05.240 --> 39:08.280
that all you'll have left is some galaxy clusters

39:08.280 --> 39:10.440
and that are sort of disconnected from each other.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.680
But before then, for the next 100 million years,

39:13.680 --> 39:17.640
100 billion years, excuse me, they will interact.

39:17.640 --> 39:18.920
There will be this community

39:18.920 --> 39:21.120
of all the grabby alien civilizations

39:21.120 --> 39:22.480
and each one of them will hear about

39:22.480 --> 39:25.000
and even meet thousands of others.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.280
And we might hope to join them someday

39:28.280 --> 39:29.760
and become part of that community.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.120
That's an interesting thing to aspire to.

39:32.120 --> 39:36.000
Yes, interesting is an interesting word.

39:36.880 --> 39:41.000
Is the universe of alien civilizations defined by war

39:41.000 --> 39:46.000
as much or more than war defined human history?

39:48.960 --> 39:52.240
I would say it's defined by competition.

39:52.240 --> 39:56.280
And then the question is how much competition implies war.

39:57.120 --> 40:02.120
So up until recently, competition defined life on earth.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.640
Competition between species and organisms

40:07.640 --> 40:10.320
and among humans, competitions among individuals

40:10.320 --> 40:13.280
and communities, and that competition often took the form

40:13.280 --> 40:15.200
of war in the last 10,000 years.

40:16.680 --> 40:20.400
Many people now are hoping or even expecting

40:20.400 --> 40:23.920
to sort of suppress and end competition in human affairs.

40:24.920 --> 40:27.320
They regulate business competition,

40:27.320 --> 40:30.440
they prevent military competition.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.360
And that's a future I think a lot of people will like

40:34.360 --> 40:35.440
to continue and strengthen.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.040
People will like to have something close

40:37.040 --> 40:39.400
to world government or world governance

40:39.400 --> 40:40.920
or at least a world community.

40:40.920 --> 40:42.760
And they will like to suppress war

40:42.760 --> 40:45.680
and many forms of business and personal competition

40:45.680 --> 40:46.960
over the coming centuries.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.840
And they may like that so much

40:50.840 --> 40:53.160
that they prevent interstellar colonization,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.160
which would become the end of that era.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.200
That is interstellar colonization would just return

40:58.200 --> 41:01.560
severe competition to human or our descendant affairs.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.040
And many civilizations may prefer that

41:04.040 --> 41:05.480
and ours may prefer that.

41:05.480 --> 41:09.080
But if they choose to allow interstellar colonization,

41:09.080 --> 41:11.640
they will have chosen to allow competition

41:11.640 --> 41:12.920
to return with great force.

41:12.920 --> 41:14.720
That is, there's really not much of a way

41:14.720 --> 41:18.120
to centrally govern a rapidly expanding sphere

41:18.120 --> 41:19.200
of civilization.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.600
And so I think one of the most solid things

41:22.600 --> 41:24.000
we can predict about Grabby Islands

41:24.000 --> 41:26.720
is they have accepted competition

41:26.720 --> 41:28.960
and they have internal competition.

41:28.960 --> 41:31.880
And therefore they have the potential for competition

41:31.880 --> 41:33.400
when they meet each other at the borders.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.360
But whether that's military competition

41:36.360 --> 41:38.200
is more of an open question.

41:38.200 --> 41:42.000
So military meaning physically destructive, right.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.720
So there's a lot to say there.

41:47.720 --> 41:51.720
So one idea that you kind of proposed is

41:52.920 --> 41:57.200
progress might be maximized through competition,

41:58.080 --> 42:00.680
through some kind of healthy competition,

42:00.680 --> 42:02.400
some definition of healthy.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.520
So like constructive, not destructive competition.

42:06.520 --> 42:10.960
So like we would likely, Grabby Alien civilizations

42:10.960 --> 42:13.440
would be likely defined by competition

42:13.440 --> 42:15.240
because they can expand faster

42:15.240 --> 42:18.400
because competition allows innovation

42:18.400 --> 42:19.880
and sort of the battle of ideas.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.040
The way I would take the logic is to say,

42:23.040 --> 42:27.520
competition just happens if you can't coordinate to stop it.

42:27.520 --> 42:30.080
And you probably can't coordinate to stop it

42:30.080 --> 42:32.320
in an expanding interstellar way.

42:32.320 --> 42:37.320
So competition is a fundamental force in the universe.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.520
It has been so far and it would be

42:40.520 --> 42:43.280
within an expanding Grabby Alien civilization.

42:43.280 --> 42:47.240
But we today have the chance, many people think and hope,

42:47.240 --> 42:50.160
of greatly controlling and limiting competition

42:50.160 --> 42:52.920
within our civilization for a while.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.840
And that's an interesting choice,

42:55.840 --> 43:00.840
whether to allow competition to sort of regain its full force

43:01.040 --> 43:03.960
or whether to suppress and manage it.

43:03.960 --> 43:08.960
Well, one of the open questions that has been raised

43:09.000 --> 43:13.480
in the past less than a hundred years

43:13.480 --> 43:16.560
is whether our desire

43:16.560 --> 43:19.800
to lessen the destructive nature of competition

43:19.800 --> 43:22.280
or the destructive kind of competition

43:22.280 --> 43:27.160
will be outpaced by the destructive power of our weapons.

43:28.800 --> 43:33.720
Sort of if nuclear weapons and weapons of that kind

43:35.680 --> 43:40.640
become more destructive than our desire for peace,

43:40.640 --> 43:44.200
then all it takes is one asshole at the party

43:44.200 --> 43:45.560
to ruin the party.

43:45.560 --> 43:48.120
It takes one asshole to make a delay,

43:48.120 --> 43:51.560
but not that much of a delay on the cosmological scales

43:51.560 --> 43:52.520
we're talking about.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.200
So even a vast nuclear war,

43:56.200 --> 43:59.600
if it happened here right now on Earth,

43:59.600 --> 44:01.880
it would not kill all humans.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.360
It certainly wouldn't kill all life.

44:05.360 --> 44:10.200
And so human civilization would return within 100,000 years.

44:10.240 --> 44:14.280
So all the history of atrocities,

44:14.280 --> 44:19.280
and if you look at the Black Plague,

44:23.440 --> 44:26.560
which is not human cause atrocities or whatever.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.320
There are a lot of military atrocities in history.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.160
Absolutely.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.000
In the 20th century,

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
those challenges to think about human nature,

44:36.640 --> 44:40.400
but the cosmic scale of time and space,

44:40.400 --> 44:44.600
they do not stop the human spirit, essentially.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.000
The humanity goes on.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.640
Through all the atrocities, it goes on, most likely.

44:50.640 --> 44:53.880
So even a nuclear war isn't enough to destroy us

44:55.120 --> 44:57.360
or to stop our potential from expanding,

44:57.360 --> 45:02.360
but we could institute a regime of global governance

45:02.720 --> 45:04.080
that limited competition,

45:04.080 --> 45:06.960
including military and business competition of sorts,

45:06.960 --> 45:09.720
and that could prevent our expansion.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.680
Of course, to play devil's advocate,

45:15.400 --> 45:20.400
global governance is centralized power,

45:20.920 --> 45:22.600
and power corrupts,

45:22.600 --> 45:25.560
and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.960
One of the aspects of competition

45:27.960 --> 45:30.000
that's been very productive

45:30.000 --> 45:35.000
is not letting any one person, any one country,

45:35.320 --> 45:39.960
any one center of power become absolutely powerful,

45:39.960 --> 45:43.400
because that's another lesson, is it seems to corrupt.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.520
There's something about ego in the human mind

45:45.520 --> 45:47.680
that seems to be corrupted by power.

45:47.680 --> 45:50.360
So when you say global governance,

45:50.360 --> 45:55.360
that terrifies me more than the possibility of war,

45:55.520 --> 45:58.000
because it's...

45:58.000 --> 45:59.960
I think people will be less terrified

45:59.960 --> 46:01.400
than you are right now,

46:01.400 --> 46:04.320
and let me try to paint the picture from their point of view.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.560
This isn't my point of view,

46:05.560 --> 46:08.480
but I think it's going to be a widely shared point of view.

46:08.480 --> 46:12.120
This is two devil's advocates arguing, two devils, okay?

46:12.120 --> 46:16.920
So for the last half century and into the continuing future,

46:16.920 --> 46:21.920
we actually have had a strong elite global community

46:22.480 --> 46:25.040
that shares a lot of values and beliefs

46:25.040 --> 46:30.000
and has created a lot of convergence in global policy.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.280
So if you look at electromagnetic spectrum

46:32.280 --> 46:36.120
or medical experiments or pandemic policy

46:36.120 --> 46:40.080
or nuclear power energy or regulating airplanes

46:40.080 --> 46:42.080
or just in a wide range of area,

46:42.080 --> 46:45.560
in fact, the world has very similar regulations

46:45.560 --> 46:47.040
and rules everywhere.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.280
And it's not a coincidence

46:48.280 --> 46:50.920
because they are part of a world community

46:50.920 --> 46:53.600
where people get together at places like Davos, et cetera,

46:53.600 --> 46:57.320
where world elites want to be respected

46:57.320 --> 46:58.640
by other world elites,

46:58.640 --> 47:02.400
and they have a convergence of opinion,

47:02.400 --> 47:06.240
and that produces something like global governance,

47:06.240 --> 47:08.200
but without a global center.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.960
And this is sort of what human mobs or communities

47:10.960 --> 47:11.840
have done for a long time.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.800
That is, humans can coordinate together on shared behavior

47:14.800 --> 47:18.840
without a center by having gossip and reputation

47:18.840 --> 47:21.080
within a community of elites.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.800
And that is what we have been doing

47:22.800 --> 47:24.840
and are likely to do a lot more of.

47:24.840 --> 47:27.920
So for example, one of the things that's happening,

47:27.920 --> 47:29.160
say, with the war in Ukraine

47:29.160 --> 47:32.440
is that this world community of elites has decided

47:32.440 --> 47:35.000
that they disapprove of the Russian invasion,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.160
and they are coordinating to pull resources together

47:38.160 --> 47:40.520
from all around the world in order to oppose it.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.120
And they are proud of that,

47:43.320 --> 47:44.960
sharing that opinion in there,

47:44.960 --> 47:47.640
and they feel that they are morally justified

47:47.640 --> 47:49.880
in their stance there.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.000
And that's the kind of event

47:53.000 --> 47:55.440
that actually brings world elite communities together,

47:55.440 --> 47:59.600
where they come together and they push a particular policy

47:59.600 --> 48:02.520
and position that they share and that they achieve successes.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.440
And the same sort of passion animates global elites

48:05.440 --> 48:08.960
with respect to, say, global warming or global poverty

48:08.960 --> 48:09.800
and other sorts of things.

48:09.800 --> 48:12.360
And they are, in fact, making progress

48:12.360 --> 48:13.640
on those sorts of things

48:13.640 --> 48:17.360
through shared global community of elites.

48:18.360 --> 48:19.600
And in some sense,

48:19.600 --> 48:22.160
they are slowly walking toward global governance,

48:22.160 --> 48:25.520
slowly strengthening various world institutions of governance,

48:25.520 --> 48:28.600
but cautiously, carefully watching out

48:28.600 --> 48:31.920
for the possibility of a single power that might corrupt it.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.080
I think a lot of people over the coming centuries

48:35.080 --> 48:36.960
will look at that history and like it.

48:38.120 --> 48:41.160
It's an interesting thought.

48:41.160 --> 48:44.240
And thank you for playing that devil's advocate there.

48:45.160 --> 48:50.160
But I think the elites too easily lose touch

48:51.000 --> 48:55.920
of the morals that the best of human nature

48:55.920 --> 48:57.280
and power corrupts.

48:57.280 --> 48:59.520
Sure, but if their view is the one

48:59.520 --> 49:01.160
that determines what happens,

49:01.160 --> 49:04.240
their view may still end up there,

49:04.240 --> 49:06.520
even if you or I might criticize it

49:06.520 --> 49:07.840
from that point of view.

49:07.840 --> 49:11.080
From a perspective of minimizing human suffering,

49:11.080 --> 49:15.840
elites can use topics of the war in Ukraine

49:15.840 --> 49:19.720
and climate change and all of those things

49:19.720 --> 49:23.880
to sell an idea to the world

49:25.040 --> 49:30.040
and with disregard to the amount of suffering it causes,

49:30.440 --> 49:32.240
their actual actions.

49:32.240 --> 49:34.520
So like you can tell all kinds of narratives,

49:34.520 --> 49:36.560
that's the way propaganda works.

49:36.560 --> 49:40.000
Hitler really sold the idea

49:40.000 --> 49:42.360
that everything Germany is doing is either,

49:42.360 --> 49:44.480
it's the victim is defending itself

49:44.480 --> 49:46.360
against the cruelty of the world

49:46.360 --> 49:50.360
and it's actually trying to bring out about a better world.

49:50.360 --> 49:54.400
So every power center thinks they're doing good.

49:54.400 --> 49:59.400
And so this is the positive of competition,

49:59.880 --> 50:02.320
not of having multiple power centers.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.440
This kind of gathering of elites

50:05.520 --> 50:08.560
makes me very, very, very nervous.

50:08.560 --> 50:13.560
The dinners, the meetings in the closed rooms,

50:13.920 --> 50:17.200
I don't know, another...

50:17.200 --> 50:19.920
But remember we talked about separating our cold analysis

50:19.920 --> 50:22.600
of what's likely or possible from what we prefer

50:22.600 --> 50:25.080
and so this isn't exactly enough time for that.

50:25.080 --> 50:29.000
We might say, I would recommend we don't go this route

50:29.000 --> 50:30.960
of a strong world governance

50:30.960 --> 50:35.120
and because I would say it'll preclude this possibility

50:35.120 --> 50:36.400
of becoming rabbi aliens,

50:36.400 --> 50:39.560
of filling the nearest million galaxies

50:39.560 --> 50:43.840
for the next billion years with vast amounts of activity

50:43.840 --> 50:47.120
and interest and value of life out there,

50:47.120 --> 50:49.040
that's the thing we would lose

50:49.040 --> 50:51.320
by deciding that we wouldn't expand,

50:51.320 --> 50:52.520
that we would stay here

50:52.520 --> 50:56.000
and keep our comfortable shared governance.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
So you, wait, you think that global governance

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
makes it more likely or less likely

51:07.120 --> 51:08.840
that we expand out into the universe?

51:08.840 --> 51:10.160
Less.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.000
So okay.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.480
This is the key point.

51:12.480 --> 51:16.280
Right, right, so screw the elites.

51:16.280 --> 51:19.440
So if we want to expand, wait, do we want to expand?

51:19.440 --> 51:23.400
So again, I want to separate my neutral analysis

51:23.400 --> 51:26.600
from my evaluation and say, first of all,

51:26.600 --> 51:29.400
I have an analysis that tells us this is a key choice

51:29.400 --> 51:31.280
that we will face and that it's a key choice

51:31.280 --> 51:33.240
other aliens have faced out there

51:33.240 --> 51:34.680
and it could be that only one in 10

51:34.680 --> 51:37.680
or only one in 100 civilizations chooses to expand

51:37.680 --> 51:39.440
and the rest of them stay quiet

51:39.440 --> 51:40.880
and that's how it goes out there

51:40.880 --> 51:42.680
and we face that choice too

51:44.080 --> 51:46.800
and it'll happen sometime in the next 10 million years,

51:46.800 --> 51:48.200
maybe the next thousand,

51:48.200 --> 51:50.680
but the key thing to notice from our point of view

51:50.680 --> 51:54.400
is that even though you might like our global governance,

51:54.400 --> 51:56.160
you might like the fact that we've come together,

51:56.160 --> 51:58.080
we no longer have massive wars

51:58.080 --> 52:00.400
and we no longer have destructive competition

52:01.640 --> 52:04.240
and that we could continue that,

52:04.240 --> 52:05.880
the cost of continuing that would be

52:05.880 --> 52:08.040
to prevent interstellar colonization.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.320
That is once you allow interstellar colonization,

52:10.320 --> 52:12.680
then you've lost control of those colonies

52:12.680 --> 52:16.040
and whatever they change into, they could come back here

52:16.040 --> 52:18.080
and compete with you back here

52:18.080 --> 52:20.000
as a result of having lost control

52:20.000 --> 52:23.720
and I think if people value that global governance

52:23.720 --> 52:26.400
and global community and regulation

52:26.440 --> 52:28.160
and all the things it can do enough,

52:28.160 --> 52:31.720
they would then want to prevent interstellar colonization.

52:31.720 --> 52:33.920
I wanna have a conversation with those people.

52:33.920 --> 52:38.920
I believe that both for humanity, for the good of humanity

52:38.920 --> 52:41.080
for what I believe is good in humanity

52:41.080 --> 52:46.080
and for expansion, exploration, innovation,

52:46.160 --> 52:50.040
distributing the centers of power is very beneficial.

52:50.040 --> 52:51.480
So this whole meeting of elites

52:51.480 --> 52:55.080
and I've been very fortunate to meet

52:55.080 --> 52:56.800
quite a large number of elites.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.120
They make me nervous because

53:03.320 --> 53:06.800
it's easy to lose touch of reality.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.240
I'm nervous about that in myself

53:09.240 --> 53:11.760
to make sure that you never lose touch

53:12.640 --> 53:17.640
as you get sort of older, wiser,

53:17.880 --> 53:20.200
you know how you generally get like disrespectful

53:20.200 --> 53:21.960
of kids, kids these days.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.600
No, the kids are beautiful.

53:23.640 --> 53:26.760
I think you should hear a stronger case for their position.

53:26.760 --> 53:27.840
So I'm gonna play for them.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.120
For the elites.

53:29.120 --> 53:33.680
Yes, well for the limiting of expansion

53:33.680 --> 53:37.200
and for the regulation of behavior.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.880
Just, okay, can I linger on that?

53:38.880 --> 53:39.720
Sure.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.760
So you're saying those two are connected.

53:41.760 --> 53:45.040
So the human civilization and alien civilizations

53:45.040 --> 53:47.920
come to a crossroads.

53:47.920 --> 53:51.240
They have to decide, do we want to expand or not?

53:51.240 --> 53:53.200
And connected to that,

53:53.200 --> 53:56.600
do we want to give a lot of power to a central elite?

53:56.600 --> 54:01.600
Do we want to distribute the power centers

54:02.240 --> 54:05.600
which is naturally connected to the expansion?

54:05.600 --> 54:08.080
When you expand, you distribute the power.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.160
If say over the next thousand years,

54:11.160 --> 54:13.200
we fill up the solar system, right?

54:13.200 --> 54:15.440
We go out from earth and we colonize Mars

54:15.440 --> 54:17.440
and we change a lot of things.

54:17.440 --> 54:20.320
Within a solar system, still everything is within reach.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.800
That is, if there's a rebellious colony around Neptune,

54:22.800 --> 54:24.480
you can throw rocks at it and smash it

54:24.480 --> 54:26.480
and then teach them discipline, okay?

54:27.480 --> 54:32.480
A central control over the solar system is feasible.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.080
But once you let it escape the solar system,

54:35.080 --> 54:36.040
it's no longer feasible.

54:36.040 --> 54:37.720
But if you have a solar system

54:37.720 --> 54:39.120
that doesn't have a central control,

54:39.120 --> 54:41.680
maybe broken into a thousand different political units

54:41.680 --> 54:43.040
in the solar system,

54:43.040 --> 54:45.400
then any one part of that

54:45.400 --> 54:48.000
that allows interstellar colonization and it happens.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.720
That is interstellar colonization happens

54:50.720 --> 54:54.160
when only one party chooses to do it and is able to do it.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.920
And that's what it is there for.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.760
So we can just say in a world of competition,

54:58.760 --> 55:01.320
if interstellar colonization is possible, it will happen.

55:01.320 --> 55:02.800
And then competition will continue.

55:02.800 --> 55:04.720
And that will sort of ensure the continuation

55:04.720 --> 55:06.800
of competition into the indefinite future.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.080
Yeah, and competition, we don't know,

55:10.080 --> 55:11.960
but competition can take violent forms

55:11.960 --> 55:13.480
or can take productive forms.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.440
And the case I was going to make is that

55:15.440 --> 55:17.400
I think one of the things that most scares people

55:17.400 --> 55:20.640
about competition is not just that it creates holocausts

55:20.640 --> 55:22.880
and death on massive scales,

55:22.880 --> 55:27.880
is that it's likely to change who we are and what we value.

55:28.520 --> 55:29.880
Yes.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.800
So this is the other thing with power.

55:34.040 --> 55:37.280
As we grow, as human civilization grows,

55:37.280 --> 55:41.600
becomes multi-planetary, multi-solar system potentially,

55:41.600 --> 55:44.440
how does that change us, do you think?

55:44.440 --> 55:45.800
I think the more you think about it,

55:45.800 --> 55:48.040
the more you realize it can change us a lot.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.520
So, first of all, I would say-

55:49.520 --> 55:50.800
This is pretty dark, by the way.

55:50.800 --> 55:53.640
Well, it's just honest.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.040
Right, well, I'm trying to agree there.

55:55.040 --> 55:56.040
I think the first thing you should say,

55:56.040 --> 55:57.200
if you look at history,

55:57.200 --> 55:59.920
just human history over the last 10,000 years,

55:59.920 --> 56:01.480
if you really understood

56:01.480 --> 56:03.000
what people were like a long time ago,

56:03.000 --> 56:05.440
you'd realize they were really quite different.

56:05.440 --> 56:08.000
Ancient cultures created people

56:08.000 --> 56:08.960
who were really quite different.

56:08.960 --> 56:11.680
Most historical fiction lies to you about that.

56:11.680 --> 56:14.640
It often offers you modern characters in an ancient world.

56:14.760 --> 56:16.960
But if you actually study history,

56:16.960 --> 56:18.560
you will see just how different they were

56:18.560 --> 56:20.640
and how differently they thought.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.640
And they've changed a lot many times,

56:23.640 --> 56:25.280
and they've changed a lot across time.

56:25.280 --> 56:27.520
So I think the most obvious prediction about the future

56:27.520 --> 56:30.440
is even if you only have the mechanisms of change

56:30.440 --> 56:31.480
we've seen in the past,

56:31.480 --> 56:34.000
you should still expect a lot of change in the future.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.080
But we have a lot bigger mechanisms

56:36.080 --> 56:39.040
for change in the future than we had in the past.

56:39.040 --> 56:42.600
So I have this book called The Age of M,

56:42.640 --> 56:44.880
Work, Love and Life and Robots Rule the Earth.

56:44.880 --> 56:46.160
And it's about what happens

56:46.160 --> 56:48.160
if brain emulations become possible.

56:48.160 --> 56:51.360
So a brain emulation is where you take a actual human brain

56:51.360 --> 56:53.880
and you scan it and find spatial and chemical detail

56:53.880 --> 56:57.560
to create a computer simulation of that brain.

56:57.560 --> 57:00.320
And then those computer simulations of brains

57:00.320 --> 57:02.280
are basically citizens in a new world.

57:02.280 --> 57:04.720
They work and they vote and they fall in love

57:04.720 --> 57:06.960
and they get mad and they lie to each other.

57:06.960 --> 57:08.200
And this is a whole new world.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.840
And my book is about analyzing

57:09.840 --> 57:12.760
how that world is different than our world.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.800
Basically using competition as my key lever of analysis.

57:15.800 --> 57:18.040
That is, if that world remains competitive

57:18.040 --> 57:20.600
then I can figure out how they change in that world,

57:20.600 --> 57:22.360
what they do differently than we do.

57:23.280 --> 57:24.920
And it's very different.

57:25.840 --> 57:28.560
And it's different in ways that are shocking sometimes

57:28.560 --> 57:31.600
to many people and ways some people don't like.

57:31.600 --> 57:32.760
I think it's an okay world,

57:32.760 --> 57:34.720
but I have to admit it's quite different.

57:34.720 --> 57:38.080
And that's just one technology.

57:38.080 --> 57:41.120
If we add, you know, dozens more technologies,

57:41.120 --> 57:43.040
changes into the future, you know,

57:43.040 --> 57:45.320
we should just expect it's possible

57:45.320 --> 57:47.520
to become very different than who we are.

57:47.520 --> 57:49.880
I mean, in the space of all possible minds,

57:49.880 --> 57:52.040
our minds are a particular architecture,

57:52.040 --> 57:55.040
a particular structure, a particular set of habits,

57:55.040 --> 57:56.400
and they are only, you know,

57:56.400 --> 57:59.200
one piece in a vast space of possibilities.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.960
The space of possible minds is really huge.

58:01.960 --> 58:05.680
So yeah, let's linger on the space of possible minds

58:05.680 --> 58:09.240
for a moment, just to sort of humble ourselves.

58:11.040 --> 58:15.640
How peculiar our peculiarities are.

58:15.640 --> 58:20.040
Like the fact that we like a particular kind of sex

58:20.920 --> 58:23.600
and the fact that we eat food through one hole

58:24.480 --> 58:26.920
and poop through another hole.

58:26.920 --> 58:30.080
And that seems to be a fundamental aspect of life

58:30.080 --> 58:31.480
is very important to us.

58:32.440 --> 58:36.840
And that life is finite in a certain kind of way.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.880
We have a meat vehicle.

58:38.880 --> 58:40.960
So death is very important to us.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.280
I wonder which aspects are fundamental

58:43.280 --> 58:46.280
or would be common throughout human history

58:46.280 --> 58:48.320
and also throughout, sorry,

58:48.320 --> 58:50.480
throughout history of life on earth

58:50.480 --> 58:53.120
and throughout other kinds of lives.

58:53.120 --> 58:55.040
Like what is really useful?

58:55.040 --> 58:56.720
You mentioned competition seems to be

58:56.720 --> 58:57.760
a one fundamental thing.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.680
I've tried to do analysis of

59:00.680 --> 59:02.600
where our distant descendants might go

59:02.600 --> 59:04.240
in terms of what are robust features

59:04.240 --> 59:06.160
we could predict about our descendants.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.240
So again, I have this analysis of sort of

59:08.240 --> 59:11.040
the next generation, so the next era after ours,

59:11.040 --> 59:12.440
that if you think of human history

59:12.440 --> 59:14.760
as having three eras so far, right?

59:14.760 --> 59:16.000
There was the forager era,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.120
the farmer era, and the industry era.

59:18.120 --> 59:19.680
Then my attempt in age of M

59:19.680 --> 59:21.400
is to analyze the next era after that.

59:21.400 --> 59:22.320
And it's very different,

59:22.320 --> 59:23.560
but of course there could be

59:23.560 --> 59:25.360
more and more eras after that.

59:25.360 --> 59:27.880
So analyzing a particular scenario

59:27.880 --> 59:29.200
and thinking it through is one way

59:29.200 --> 59:31.920
to try to see how different the future could be,

59:31.920 --> 59:34.000
but that doesn't give you some sort of

59:34.000 --> 59:35.200
sense of what's typical.

59:36.280 --> 59:39.120
But I have tried to analyze what's typical.

59:39.120 --> 59:40.840
And so I have two predictions

59:40.840 --> 59:42.960
I think I can make pretty solidly.

59:44.040 --> 59:45.840
One thing is that we know at the moment

59:45.840 --> 59:49.040
that humans discount the future rapidly.

59:49.040 --> 59:51.280
So we discount the future

59:51.280 --> 59:53.200
in terms of caring about consequences,

59:53.200 --> 59:55.280
roughly a factor of two per generation

59:56.200 --> 59:57.680
and there's a solid evolutionary analysis

59:57.680 --> 59:59.920
why sexual creatures would do that.

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.480
Because basically your descendants

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.240
only share half of your genes

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.280
and your descendants are a generation away.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.600
So we only care about our grandchildren.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:11.040
Basically that's a factor of four later

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.320
because it's later.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.160
So this actually explains typical interest rates

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.800
in the economy, that is interest rates

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.400
are greatly influenced by our discount rates

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.640
and we basically discount the future

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.320
by a factor of two per generation.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.440
But that's a side effect of the way

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:33.600
our preferences evolved as sexually selected creatures.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.880
We should expect that in the longer run

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.280
creatures will evolve who don't discount the future.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.400
They will care about the long run

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.520
and they will therefore not neglect the wrong.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.200
So for example, for things like global warming

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.280
or things like that, at the moment,

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.040
many commenters are sad that basically

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.480
ordinary people don't seem to care much,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.040
market prices don't seem to care much

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.400
and more ordinary people, it doesn't really impact them

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.440
much because humans don't care much

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.240
about the long-term future.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.360
But and futurists find it hard to motivate people

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.200
and to engage people about the long-term future

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.280
because they just don't care that much.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.720
But that's a side effect of this particular way

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.920
that our preferences evolved about the future.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.960
And so in the future, they will neglect the future less.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.560
And that's an interesting thing

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.800
that we can predict robustly.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.480
Eventually, maybe as few centuries, maybe longer,

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.920
eventually our descendants will care about the future.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.960
Can you speak to the intuition behind that?

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.200
Is it useful to think more about the future?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.000
Right, if evolution rewards creatures

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.040
for having many descendants,

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.760
then if you have decisions that influence

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.520
how many descendants you have,

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.680
then that would be good if you made those decisions.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.880
But in order to do that, you'll have to care about them.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.760
You'll have to care about that future.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.640
To push back, that's if you're trying

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.080
to maximize the number of descendants.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.680
But the nice thing about not caring too much

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.520
about the long-term future

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.640
is you're more likely to take big risks

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.000
or you're less risk averse.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.640
And it's possible that both evolution

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.960
and just life in the universe

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.520
is rewarded, rewards the risk takers.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.160
Well, we actually have analysis

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.240
of the ideal risk preferences too.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:19.760
So there's a literature on ideal preferences

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.440
that evolution should promote.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.840
And for example, there's a literature

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.600
on competing investment funds

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.480
and what the managers of those funds

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.080
should care about in terms of risk,

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.040
various kinds of risks, and in terms of discounting.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.440
So managers of investment funds

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.480
should basically have logarithmic risk,

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.720
i.e. in shared risk, in correlated risk,

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.520
but be very risk-neutral

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.040
with respect to uncorrelated risk.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.960
So that's a feature that's predicted

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.240
to happen about individual personal choices in biology

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.280
and also for investment funds.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.240
So that's also something we can say about the long run.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.840
What's correlated and uncorrelated risk?

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.480
If there's something that would affect

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.840
all of your descendants,

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.440
then if you take that risk,

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.560
you might have more descendants than you might have zero.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.920
And that's just really bad to have zero descendants.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.840
But an uncorrelated risk would be a risk

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.520
that some of your descendants would suffer,

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:19.760
but others wouldn't.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:22.040
And then you have a portfolio of descendants.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:25.840
And so that portfolio ensures you against problems

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.680
with any one of them.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.640
I like the idea of portfolio of descendants.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.480
And we'll talk about portfolios with your idea

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:34.920
of you briefly mentioned, we'll return there with EM,

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:37.840
the age of EM, work, love, and life

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.600
when robots rule the earth.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.720
EM, by the way, is emulated minds.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.360
So this one of the...

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.280
M is short for emulations.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.720
M is short for emulations,

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.560
and it's kind of an idea of how we might create

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.480
artificial minds, artificial copies of minds,

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.040
or human-like intelligences.

01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:59.320
I have another dramatic prediction I can make

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.720
about long-term preferences.

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.560
Yes.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:05.080
Which is at the moment, we reproduce as the result

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.000
of a hodgepodge of preferences

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.120
that aren't very well integrated,

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.040
but sort of in our ancestral environment

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.320
induced us to reproduce.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.280
So we have preferences over being, you know,

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:17.560
sleepy and hungry and thirsty and wanting to have sex

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.840
and wanting to, you know, be excited,

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.120
excitement, et cetera, right?

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.120
And so in our ancestral environment,

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.920
the packages of preferences that we evolved to have

01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.360
did induce us to have more descendants.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.160
That's why we're here.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.000
But those packages of preferences are not a robust way

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.600
to promote having more descendants.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:39.280
They were tied to our ancestral environment,

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.120
which is no longer true.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.760
So that's one of the reasons we are now having

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.680
a big fertility decline,

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.480
because in our current environment,

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.760
our ancestral preferences are not inducing us

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:48.840
to have a lot of kids,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:52.440
which is from evolution's point of view, a big mistake.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.000
We can predict that in the longer run,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.600
there will arise creatures who just abstractly know

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.920
that what they want is more descendants.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.040
That's a very robust way to have more descendants

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.960
is to have that as your direct preference.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.480
First of all, your thinking is so clear.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.480
I love it.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:14.480
So mathematical and thank you for thinking so clear with me

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.280
and bearing with my interruptions

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.520
and going on the tangents when we go there.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.760
So you're just clearly saying

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.240
that successful long-term civilizations

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.120
will prefer to have descendants, more descendants.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.440
Not just prefer, consciously and abstractly prefer.

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:36.440
That is, it won't be the indirect consequence

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.280
of other preference.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.000
It will just be the thing they know they want.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.320
There'll be a president in the future that says,

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.800
we must have more sex.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.920
We must have more descendants

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.800
and do whatever it takes to do that.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.680
We must go to the moon and do the other things.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.760
Not because they're easy, but because they're hard,

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.160
but instead of the moon, let's have lots of sex.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.040
But there's a lot of ways to have descendants, right?

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.280
Right, so that's the whole point.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.120
When the world gets more complicated

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.760
and there are many possible strategies,

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.720
it's having that as your abstract preference

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.440
that will force you to think through those possibilities

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.040
and pick the one that's most effective.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.400
So just to clarify, descendants doesn't necessarily mean

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.120
the narrow definition of descendants,

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:19.000
meaning humans having sex and then having babies.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.600
You can have artificial intelligence systems

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:26.600
that in whom you instill some capability of cognition

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.280
and perhaps even consciousness.

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.560
You can also create, through genetics and biology,

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.680
clones of yourself or slightly modified clones,

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.800
thousands of them.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.000
So all kinds of descendants.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.240
It could be descendants in the space of ideas too,

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:46.640
for somehow we no longer exist in this meat vehicle.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.480
It's now just like whatever the definition of a life form is,

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.320
you have descendants of those life forms.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.600
Yes, and they will be thoughtful about that.

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.640
They will have thought about what counts as a descendant

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.240
and that'll be important to them to have the right concept.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.000
So the they there is very interesting, who they are.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.360
But the key thing is we're making predictions

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:09.600
that I think are somewhat robust

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.840
about what our distant descendants will be like.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.080
Another thing I think you would automatically accept

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.520
is they will almost entirely be artificial.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.040
And I think that would be the obvious prediction

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.560
about any aliens we would meet.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.440
That is, they would long sense have given up

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.280
reproducing biologically.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:27.240
Well, it's like organic or something.

01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:28.840
It's all real in its force.

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.400
It might be squishy and made out of hydrocarbons,

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.960
but it would be artificial in the sense of made in factories

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.040
with designs on CAD things, right?

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.240
Factories with scale economies.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.400
So the factories we have made on earth today

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.960
have much larger scale economies

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.160
than the factories in our cells.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.920
So the factories in our cells are, there are marvels,

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.840
but they don't achieve very many scale economies.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.120
They're tiny little factories.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.160
But they're all factories.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.000
Yes.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.840
Factories on top of factories.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.720
So everything, the factories on top of the factories

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.960
that are designed is different

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.000
than sort of the factories that have evolved.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.160
I think the nature of the word design

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.320
is very interesting to uncover there.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:05.280
But let me, in terms of aliens,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.280
let me analyze your Twitter like it's Shakespeare, okay?

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.320
There's a tweet that says,

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.520
define hello, in quotes, alien civilizations

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.960
as one that might, in the next million years,

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.040
identify humans as intelligent and civilized,

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.160
travel to earth and say hello

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:26.560
by making their presence and advanced abilities

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560
known to us.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:30.480
The next 15 polls, this is a Twitter thread,

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.320
the next 15 polls ask about such hello aliens.

01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.360
And what these polls ask is your Twitter followers

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.760
what they think those aliens would be like,

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.680
certain particular qualities.

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:47.880
So poll number one is what percent of hello aliens

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:51.320
evolved from biological species with two main genders?

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.320
And the popular vote is above 80%.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.680
So most of them have two genders.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:08:59.800
What do you think about that?

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:00.760
I'll ask you about some of these

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.600
because they're so interesting.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.640
It's such an interesting question.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640
It is a fun set of questions.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.880
Yes, it's a fun set of questions.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.040
So the genders as we look through evolutionary history,

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.560
what's the usefulness of that

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.640
as opposed to having just one or like millions?

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.480
So there's a question in evolution of life on earth,

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:19.800
there are very few species that have more than two genders.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.200
There are some, but they aren't very many.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.160
But there's an enormous number of species

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.000
that do have two genders, much more than one.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.040
And so there's a literature on

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.000
why did multiple genders evolve?

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.600
And that's sort of what's the point of having males

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.400
and females versus hermaphrodites.

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:38.920
So most plants are hermaphrodites,

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.840
that is they would mate male, female,

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.840
but each plant can be either role.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.600
And then most animals have chosen to split

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.400
into males and females.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.000
And then they're differentiating the two genders.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.440
And there's an interesting set of questions

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.560
about why that happens.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.520
Because you can do selection,

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:03.040
you basically have like one gender competes

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.280
for the affection of other

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.640
and there's sexual partnership that creates the offspring.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.880
So there's sexual selection.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.440
It's nice to have like to a party,

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.880
it's nice to have dance partners.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.920
And then each one gets to choose

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.520
based on certain characteristics.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.960
And that's an efficient mechanism

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.400
for adapting to the environment,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.440
being successfully adopted to the environment.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.080
It does look like there's an advantage.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.680
If you have males, then the males can take higher variance.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.800
And so there can be stronger selection among the males

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.960
in terms of weeding out genetic mutations

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.400
because the males have a higher variance

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.120
in their mating success.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.640
Sure, okay.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.080
Question number two,

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.280
what percent of hello aliens evolved from land animals

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:50.280
as opposed to plants or ocean slash air organisms?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.400
By the way, I did recently see that

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.400
there's only 10% of species on earth or in the ocean.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.480
So there's a lot more variety on land.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.600
There is.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.560
It's interesting.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.400
So why is that?

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:11.040
I don't even, I can't even intuit exactly why that would be.

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:13.720
Maybe survival on land is harder.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.560
And so you get a lot more.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:18.120
So the story that I understand is it's about small niches.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:21.240
So speciation can be promoted

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:23.240
by having multiple different species.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.600
So in the ocean, species are larger.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.760
That is, there are more creatures in each species

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.320
because the ocean environments don't vary as much.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.520
So if you're good in one place,

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.400
you're good in many other places.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.480
But on land, and especially in rivers,

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.360
rivers contain an enormous percentage

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.640
of the kinds of species on land, you see,

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.480
because they vary so much from place to place.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.560
And so a species can be good in one place

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.400
and then other species can't really compete

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400
because they came from a different place

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.240
where things are different.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.240
So it's a remarkable fact actually

01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:00.360
that speciation promotes evolution in the long run.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.720
That is more evolution has happened on land

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.200
because there have been more species on land

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.720
because each species has been smaller.

01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.680
And that's actually a warning about something

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:12.200
or something called rot that I've thought a lot about,

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:15.080
which is one of the problems with even a world government,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.240
which is large systems of software today

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.720
just consistently rot and decay with time

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720
and have to be replaced.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.000
And that plausibly also is a problem

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.360
for other large systems, including biological systems,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.760
legal systems, regulatory systems.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.400
And it seems like large species actually don't evolve

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.280
as effectively as small ones do.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.040
And that's an important thing to notice about.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.000
And that's actually, that's different from ordinary

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.800
sort of evolution in economies on earth

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.480
in the last few centuries, say.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.080
On earth, the more technical evolution

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.000
and economic growth happens in larger integrated cities

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.280
and nations, but in biology, it's the other way around.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.600
More evolution happened in the fragmented species.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.880
Yeah, it's such a nuanced discussion

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.520
because you can also push back in terms of nations

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.440
and at least companies.

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:10.600
It's like large companies seem to evolve less effectively.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.440
There is something that, you know,

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:15.920
they have more resources, more,

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.760
they don't even have better resilience

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.520
when you look at the scale of decades and centuries.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.520
It seems like a lot of large companies die.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.520
But still large economies do better.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.400
Like large cities grow better than small cities.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.480
Large integrated economies like the United States

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.360
or the European Union do better than small fragmented ones.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.720
So even.

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:40.360
Sure, that's a very interesting long discussion.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.720
So most of the people, and obviously votes on Twitter

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:48.320
represent the absolute objective truth of things.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.240
But an interesting question about oceans is that,

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.320
okay, remember I told you about how most planets

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.640
would last for trillions of years and then be later, right?

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.560
So people have tried to explain why life appeared on earth

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.440
by saying, oh, all those planets are gonna be unqualified

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.040
for life because of various problems.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.400
That is, they're around smaller stars, which last longer,

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:09.280
and smaller stars have some things like more solar flares,

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:10.640
maybe more tidal locking.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.640
But almost all of these problems with longer lived planets

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.760
aren't problems for ocean worlds.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:20.320
And a large fraction of planets out there are ocean worlds.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:22.560
So if life can appear on an ocean world,

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.560
then that pretty much ensures that these planets

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.320
that last a very long time could have advanced life

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.080
because there's a huge fraction of ocean worlds.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.560
So that's actually an open question.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.800
So when you say, sorry, when you say life appear,

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.040
you're kind of saying life and intelligent life.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.040
So that's an open question is land.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:52.480
And as I suppose the question behind the Twitter poll,

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.320
which is a grabby alien civilization

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.480
that comes to say hello.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.160
What's the chance that they first began their early steps,

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.800
the difficult steps they took on land?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.640
What do you think?

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.120
80% most people on Twitter think it's very likely.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.120
Right, I think people are discounting ocean worlds too much

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.400
that as I think people tend to assume that whatever we did

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.000
must be the only way it's possible.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.720
And I think people aren't giving enough credit

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.360
for other possible paths, but.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.880
Dolphins, Waterworld, by the way,

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:31.080
people criticize that movie, I love that movie.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.120
Kevin Costner can do me no wrong.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.480
Okay, next question.

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.760
What percent of hello aliens once had a nuclear war

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.400
with greater than 10 nukes fired in anger?

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.600
So not in the incompetence and as an accident.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.880
Intentional firing of nukes

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:54.400
and less than 20% was the most popular vote.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.480
That just seems wrong to me.

01:15:56.480 --> 01:15:59.960
So like, I wonder what, so most people think

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.600
once you would get nukes, we're not gonna fire them.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.200
They believe in the power of the game.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.640
I think they're assuming that if you had a nuclear war,

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.520
then that would just end civilization for good.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.840
I think that's the thinking.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.680
That's the main thing.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.880
Right, and I think that's just wrong.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.320
I think you could rise again after a nuclear war.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.640
It might take 10,000 years or 100,000 years,

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.000
but it could rise again.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.680
So what do you think about mutual assured destruction

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.880
as a force to prevent people from firing nuclear weapons?

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:29.840
That's a question that I knew to a terrifying degree

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.200
has been raised now and what's going on.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.800
Clearly it has had an effect.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:38.160
The question is just how strong an effect for how long?

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:41.720
Clearly we have not gone wild with nuclear war

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:44.400
and clearly the devastation that you would get

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.480
if you initiated a nuclear war is part of the reasons

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.160
people have been reluctant to start a war.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.840
The question is just how reliably

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.000
will that ensure the absence of a war?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.560
Yeah, the night is still young.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.400
Exactly.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.800
It's been 70 years or whatever it's been.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.160
But what do you think?

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.040
Do you think we'll see nuclear war in the century?

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:07.960
I don't know, in the century,

01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.560
but it's the sort of thing

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.960
that's likely to happen eventually.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.400
That's a very loose statement.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.600
Okay, I understand.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.600
Now this is where I pull you out of your mathematical model

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.440
and ask a human question.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.000
Do you think this particular human question?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.440
I think we've been lucky that it hasn't happened so far.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.160
But what is the nature of nuclear war?

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.040
Let's think about this.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.960
There's dictators, there's democracies,

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.480
miscommunication.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.320
How do wars start?

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.320
World War I, World War II.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.920
So the biggest datum here

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:45.120
is that we've had an enormous decline

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.960
in major war over the last century.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:48.640
So that has to be taken into account.

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:51.720
Now, so the problem is this,

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.760
war is a process that has a very long tail.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.160
That is, there are rare, very large wars.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.760
So the average war is much worse than the median war

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.600
because of this long tail.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.920
And that makes it hard to identify trends over time.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.520
So the median war has clearly gone way down

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.280
in the last century, the median rate of war.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.480
But it could be that's because the tail has gotten thicker.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:17.400
And in fact, the average war is just as bad,

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.800
but most wars are gonna be big wars.

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.680
So that's the thing we're not so sure about.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.680
There's no strong data on wars

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:31.680
with one, because of the destructive nature of the weapons,

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.840
kill hundreds of millions of people.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.560
There's no data on this, but we can start intuiting.

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.280
But we can see that the power law,

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.160
we can do a power law fit to the rate of wars

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.680
and it's a power law with a thick tail.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.920
So it's one of those things that you should expect

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.160
most of the damage to be in the few biggest ones.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.200
So that's also true for pandemics and a few other things.

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.560
For pandemics, most of the damage is in the few biggest ones.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.600
So the median pandemics of ours,

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.920
less than the average that you should expect in the future.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:02.920
But that fitting of data is very questionable

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.520
because everything you said is correct.

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.800
The question is like, what can we infer

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.800
about the future of civilization threatening pandemics

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.400
or nuclear war from studying the history

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.160
of the 20th century?

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.760
So you can't just fit it to the data,

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.920
the rate of wars and the destructive nature.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.840
That's not how nuclear war will happen.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.680
Nuclear war happens with two assholes or idiots

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.200
that have access to a button.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.080
Small wars happen that way too.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.320
No, I understand that, but it's very important,

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.080
small wars aside,

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.920
it's very important to understand the dynamics,

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.160
the human dynamics and the geopolitics

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.560
of the way nuclear war happens

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:52.560
in order to predict how we can minimize the chance of-

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:55.480
It is a common and useful intellectual strategy

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.320
to take something that could be really big

01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.560
but is often very small

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.360
and fit the distribution of the data,

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:02.760
small things, which you have a lot of them,

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.920
and then ask, do I believe the big things

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.960
are really that different?

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:06.800
Right, I see.

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.600
And so sometimes it's reasonable to say like,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.240
save with tornadoes or even pandemics or something.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.680
The underlying process might not be that different

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.000
for the big and small ones.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.360
It might not be.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.560
There is the fact that mutual assured destruction

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.680
seems to work to some degree,

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.440
shows you that to some degree,

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.480
it's different than the small wars.

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:36.200
So it's a really important question to understand

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:39.200
is are humans capable?

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:42.800
One human, like how many humans on earth,

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.680
if I give them a button now,

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:48.040
say you pressing this button will kill everyone on earth.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.080
Everyone, right?

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.920
How many humans will press that button?

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.760
I wanna know those numbers,

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.880
like day to day, minute to minute,

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.000
how many people have that much irresponsibility,

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:03.280
evil, incompetence, ignorance,

01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.600
whatever word you wanna assign,

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.920
there's a lot of dynamics to the psychology

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.200
that leads you to press that button, but how many?

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.600
My intuition is the number,

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.760
the more destructive that press of a button,

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.320
the fewer humans you find,

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.400
and the number gets very close to zero very quickly,

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.960
especially people have access to such a button,

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.440
but that's perhaps a hope than a reality.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.000
And unfortunately, we don't have good data on this,

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.520
which is like how destructive are humans willing to be?

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.400
So I think part of this just has to think about,

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:40.800
ask you what your time scales you're looking at, right?

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.480
So if you look at the history of war,

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:45.760
we've had a lot of wars pretty consistently

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.480
over many centuries.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.960
So if you ask, will we have a nuclear war

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:51.200
in the next 50 years?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.640
I might say, well, probably not.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.520
If I say 500 or 5,000 years,

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.680
like if the same sort of risks are underlying

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.560
and they just continue,

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.320
then you have to add that up over time

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.600
and think the risk is getting a lot larger

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.560
the longer a time scale we're looking at.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.120
But okay, let's generalize nuclear war,

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.040
because what I was more referring to

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.040
is something that kills more than 20% of the population

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.480
of humans on earth and injures,

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:25.480
or makes the other 80% suffer horribly,

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.120
survive, but suffer.

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.080
That's what I was referring to.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.800
So when you look at 500 years from now,

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.960
there might not be nuclear war,

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.720
there might be something else that's that kind of,

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.720
has that destructive effect.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.720
And I don't know, these feel like novel questions

01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:46.000
in the history of humanity.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.600
I just don't know.

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.760
I think since nuclear weapons,

01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:55.600
this has been, engineering pandemics, for example,

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.000
robotics, so nanobots.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.280
It just seems like a real new possibility

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.680
that we have to contend with

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:06.200
and we don't have good models,

01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.240
or from my perspective.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:10.800
So if you look on say the last thousand years

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.520
or 10,000 years, we could say

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.680
we've seen a certain rate at which people are willing

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.280
to make big destruction in terms of war.

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.440
And if you're willing to project that data forward,

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.440
that I think if you wanna ask over periods of thousands

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.560
or tens of thousands of years,

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:27.440
you would have a reasonable data set.

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.800
So the key question is what's changed lately?

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.040
And so a big question of which I've given a lot of thought

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:37.800
to what are the major changes that seem to have happened

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.840
in culture and human attitudes over the last few centuries

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.720
and what's our best explanation for those

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.680
so that we can project them forward into the future.

01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:48.680
And I have a story about that,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.200
which is the story that we have been drifting back

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.840
toward forager attitudes in the last few centuries

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840
as we get rich.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.480
So the idea is we spent a million years being a forager

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.840
and that was a very sort of standard lifestyle

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.520
that we know a lot about.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:06.600
Foragers sort of live in small bands,

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.800
they make decisions cooperatively, they share food,

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.960
they don't have much property, et cetera.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.600
And humans liked that.

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:18.200
And then 10,000 years ago, farming became possible,

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.640
but it was only possible because we were plastic enough

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.920
to really change our culture.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.520
Farming styles and cultures are very different.

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.760
They have slavery, they have war, they have property,

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:29.320
they have inequality, they have kings,

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.600
they stay in one place instead of wandering,

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.800
they don't have as much diversity of experience or food,

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.480
they have more disease.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:38.000
Farming life is just very different.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.720
But humans were able to sort of introduce conformity

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.480
and religion and all sorts of things to become

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.400
just a very different kind of creature as farmers.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:47.160
Farmers are just really different than foragers

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.160
in terms of their values and their lives.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.640
But the pressures that made foragers into farmers

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.400
were a part mediated by poverty.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320
Farmers are poor and if they deviated

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.080
from the farming norms that people around them supported,

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.320
they were quite at risk of starving to death.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.640
And then in the last few centuries, we've gotten rich.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:10.000
And as we've gotten rich, the social pressures

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.040
that turned foragers into farmers

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:15.720
have become less persuasive to us.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.160
So for example, a farming young woman who was told

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.720
if you have a child out of wedlock,

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.720
you and your child may starve, that was a credible threat.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:25.360
She would see actual examples around her

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:27.640
to make that a believable threat.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.400
Today, if you say to a young woman,

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:30.920
you shouldn't have a child out of wedlock,

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.560
she will see other young women around her

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.960
doing okay that way.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.840
We're all rich enough to be able to afford

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.080
that sort of a thing and therefore,

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:41.880
she's more inclined often to go with her inclinations,

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.160
her sort of more natural inclinations about such things

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.400
rather than to be pressured to follow

01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:48.480
the official farming norms

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:49.680
that you shouldn't do that sort of thing.

01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.280
And all through our lives, we have been drifting back

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.160
toward forager attitudes because we've been getting rich.

01:25:56.160 --> 01:25:59.280
And so aside from at work, which is an exception,

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.640
but elsewhere, I think this explains trends

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.280
toward less slavery, more democracy, less religion,

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.560
less fertility, more promiscuity, more travel,

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:14.240
more art, more leisure, fewer work hours.

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.400
All of these trends are basically explained

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.120
by becoming more forager-like.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.200
And much science fiction celebrates this.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.240
Star Trek or the culture novels, people like this image

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.840
that we are moving toward this world

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.880
where basically like foragers, we're peaceful, we share,

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.160
we make decisions collectively, we have a lot of free time.

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.000
We are into art.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.880
So forager, you know, forager is a word

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:42.200
and it's a loaded word because it's connected

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:47.200
to the actual, what life was actually like at that time.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.120
As you mentioned, we sometimes don't do a good job

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.320
of telling accurately what life was like back then.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.960
But you're saying if it's not exactly like foragers,

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:58.640
it rhymes in some fundamental way.

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.840
You also said peaceful.

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.920
Is it obvious that a forager with a nuclear weapon

01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:07.760
would be peaceful?

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.600
I don't know if that's 100% obvious.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.400
So we know, again, we know a fair bit

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:13.920
about what foragers' lives were like.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:16.960
The main sort of violence they had would be sexual jealousy.

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.440
They were relatively promiscuous

01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:19.760
and so there'd be a lot of jealousy.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.960
But they did not have organized wars with each other.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.320
That is, they were at peace

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.000
with their neighboring forager bands.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.560
They didn't have property in land or even in people.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.160
They didn't really have marriage.

01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.080
And so they were, in fact, peaceful.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:35.920
At that sense.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.600
When you think about large-scale wars,

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.440
they don't start large-scale wars.

01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.520
Right, they didn't have coordinated large-scale wars

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:41.680
in the ways chimpanzees do.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.560
Our chimpanzees do have wars

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.400
between one tribe of chimpanzees and others,

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:46.840
but human foragers do not.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.640
Farmers return to that, of course,

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.520
the more chimpanzee-like styles.

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.680
Well, that's a hopeful message.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.320
If we could return real quick

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:59.160
to the Hello Aliens Twitter thread.

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:01.080
One of them is really interesting about language.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:03.120
What percent of Hello Aliens would be able

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.480
to talk to us in our language?

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.000
This is the question of communication.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.480
It actually gets to the nature of language.

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:13.160
It also gets to the nature

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:16.240
of how advanced you expect them to be.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.920
So I think some people see that, like,

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.960
we have advanced over the last thousands of years

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.240
and we aren't reaching any sort of limit,

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:28.360
and so they tend to assume it could go on forever.

01:28:28.360 --> 01:28:30.360
And I actually tend to think that

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:31.720
within, say, 10 million years,

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:35.080
we will sort of max out on technology.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.760
We will sort of learn everything that's feasible to know,

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.960
for the most part.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:42.280
And then, you know, obstacles to understanding

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.800
would more be about, like, sort of cultural differences,

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:46.520
like ways in which different places

01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:49.120
had just chosen to do things differently.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:51.880
And so then the question is,

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.520
is it even possible to communicate

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.160
across some cultural distances?

01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.320
And I might think, you know,

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.240
I could imagine some maybe advanced aliens

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.400
who just become so weird and different from each other

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.800
they can't communicate with each other,

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.520
but we're probably pretty simple compared to them.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.840
So I would think, sure, if they wanted to,

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.600
they could communicate with us.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.040
So it's the simplicity of the recipient.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.480
I tend to, just to push back,

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:22.600
let's explore the possibility where that's not the case.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.000
Can we communicate with ants?

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.600
I find that this idea that...

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.440
We're not very good at communicating in general.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.280
Oh, you're saying, all right, I see.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.240
You're saying once you get orders of magnitude

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:39.920
better at communicating.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:42.000
Once they had maxed out on all, you know,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.600
communication technology in general

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.360
and they just understood in general

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.960
how to communicate with lots of things

01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.680
and had done that for millions of years.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.280
But you have to be able to, this is so interesting,

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.080
as somebody who cares a lot about empathy

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:55.280
and imagining how other people feel,

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.280
communication requires empathy,

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:03.560
meaning you have to truly understand

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.560
how the other person, the other organism sees the world.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.880
It's like a four-dimensional species

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.480
talking to a two-dimensional species.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:16.720
It's not as trivial as, to me at least,

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:18.400
as it might at first seem.

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.920
So let me reverse my position a little

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.560
because I'll say, well, the hello aliens question

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.280
really combines two different scenarios

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:30.480
that we're slipping over.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.760
So one scenario would be that the hello aliens

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.240
would be like grabby aliens.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.960
They would be just fully advanced.

01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.640
They would have been expanding for millions of years.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.920
They would have a very advanced civilization.

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:43.280
And then they would finally be arriving here, you know,

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.600
after a billion years, perhaps, of expanding,

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.720
in which case they're gonna be crazy advanced

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:49.000
at some maximal level.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.000
But the hello aliens, about aliens we might meet soon,

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.160
which might be sort of UFO aliens,

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:00.440
and UFO aliens probably are not grabby aliens.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.480
How do you get here if you're not a grabby alien?

01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.760
Well, they would have to be able to travel.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.440
Oh.

01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.640
But they would not be expansive colonizing.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.960
So for the road trip, it doesn't count as grabby.

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.360
So we're talking about expanding the colony,

01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.840
the comfortable colony.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.160
The question is, if UFOs, some of them are aliens,

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.560
what kind of aliens would they be?

01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.600
This is sort of the key question you have to ask

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.800
in order to try to interpret that scenario.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:36.120
The key fact we would know is that they are here right now,

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.040
but the universe around us is not full

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.240
of an alien civilization.

01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.560
So that says right off the bat

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:48.560
that they chose not to allow massive expansion

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.760
of a grabby civilization.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.160
Is it possible that they chose it,

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:55.120
but we just don't see them yet?

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.240
These are the stragglers, the journeymen, the-

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:00.440
So the timing coincidence is,

01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.920
it's almost surely if they are here now,

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.160
they are much older than us.

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.360
They are many millions of years older than us.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.800
And so they could have filled the galaxy

01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.200
in that last millions of years

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.520
if they had wanted to.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.920
That is, they couldn't just be right at the edge.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.720
Very unlikely, most likely they would have been around

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:20.160
waiting for us for a long time.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.520
They could have come here any time

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.880
in the last millions of years and they just chosen,

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.920
they've been waiting around for this

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.840
or they just chose to come recently.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:30.080
But the timing coincidence, it would be crazy unlikely

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.120
that they just happened to be able to get here,

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:34.160
say in the last hundred years.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.480
They would no doubt have been able to get here

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.840
far earlier than that.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.080
Again, we don't know.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.560
So this is referring to UFO sightings on Earth.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.560
We don't know if this kind of increase in sightings

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.600
have anything to do with actual visitation.

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.320
I'm just talking about the timing,

01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:52.160
they arose at some point in space time, right?

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:55.280
And it's very unlikely that that was just to the point

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.680
that they could just barely get here recently.

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.880
Almost surely they could have gotten here much earlier.

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.560
And throughout the stretch of several billion years

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.360
that Earth existed, they could have been here often.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.160
Exactly, so they could have therefore filled the galaxy

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.960
long time ago if they had wanted to.

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.920
Let's push back on that.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.560
The question to me is, isn't it possible

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.640
that the expansion of a civilization

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.640
is much harder than the travel?

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.800
The sphere of the reachable is different

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.480
than the sphere of the colonized.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.280
So isn't it possible that the sphere of places

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.920
where the stragglers go, the different people

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.040
that journey out, the explorers, is much, much larger

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:46.440
and grows much faster than the civilization?

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.520
So in which case, they would visit us.

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.680
There's a lot of visitors, the grad students

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:53.040
of the civilization.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.720
They're exploring, they're collecting the data,

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.640
but we're not yet going to see them.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.600
And by yet, I mean across millions of years.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.440
The time delay between when the first thing might arrive

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.120
and then when colonists could arrive in mass

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.680
and do a mass amount of work is cosmologically short.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.800
In human history, of course, sure, there might be

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.520
a century between that, but a century is just

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.080
a tiny amount of time on the scales we're talking about.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:24.400
So this is in computer science,

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:26.000
there's ant colony optimization.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.480
It's true for ants.

01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:30.000
So it's like when the first ant shows up, it's likely,

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.120
and if there's anything of value, it's likely

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:36.680
the other ants will follow quickly.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.560
Yeah. Relatively short.

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.600
It's also true that traveling over very long distances,

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:44.480
probably one of the main ways to make that feasible

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.440
is that you land somewhere, you colonize a bit,

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.920
you create new resources that can then allow you

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:50.760
to go farther.

01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.200
Many short hops as opposed to a giant, long journey.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:56.160
Exactly, but those hops require that you are able

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.400
to start a colonization of sorts along those hops, right?

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:01.200
You have to be able to stop somewhere,

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:04.480
make it into a way station such that you can then

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.640
support you moving farther.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.920
So what do you think of, there's been a lot of UFO sightings,

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.600
what do you think about those UFO sightings,

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.520
and what do you think if any of them are

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.880
of extraterrestrial origin and we don't see

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.240
giant civilizations out in the sky,

01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:27.640
how do you make sense of that then?

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.880
I wanna do some clearing of throats,

01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:33.000
which is people like to do on this topic, right?

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.280
They wanna make sure you understand,

01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.040
they're saying this and not that, right?

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.800
So I would say the analysis needs both a prior

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:41.800
and a likelihood.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:45.960
So the prior is what are the scenarios

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:48.760
that are at all plausible in terms of what we know

01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.840
about the universe, and then the likelihood

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.320
is the particular actual sightings,

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.760
like how hard are those to explain through various means?

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:00.360
I will establish myself as somewhat of an expert

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:03.080
on the prior, I would say my studies

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:05.120
and the things I've studied make me an expert

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.120
and I should stand up and have an opinion on that

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.160
and be able to explain it.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:12.000
The likelihood, however, is not my area of expertise.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.360
That is, I'm not a pilot, I don't do atmospheric studies

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.160
of things I haven't studied in detail,

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.760
the various kinds of atmospheric phenomena or whatever

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:23.320
that might be used to explain the particular sightings.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.320
I can just say from my amateur stance,

01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:27.880
the sightings look damn puzzling.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.640
They do not look easy to dismiss,

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.120
the attempts I've seen to easily dismiss them

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.200
seem to me to fail, it seems like these are pretty puzzling

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.560
weird stuff that deserve an expert's attention

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.600
in terms of considering asking what the likelihood is.

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:46.360
So analogy I would make is a murder trial, okay?

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.960
On average, if we say what's the chance any one person

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:52.360
murdered another person as a prior probability,

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.280
maybe one in a thousand people get murdered,

01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.320
maybe each person has a thousand people around them

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.480
who could plausibly have done it,

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.800
so the prior probability of a murder is one in a million.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:03.800
But we allow murder trials because often evidence

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.680
is sufficient to overcome on a one in a million prior

01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.040
because the evidence is often strong enough, right?

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.560
My guess, rough guess for the UFOs as aliens scenario,

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.920
at least some of them is the prior is roughly one in a thousand

01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.880
much higher than the usual murder trial,

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.640
plenty high enough that strong physical evidence

01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.480
could put you over the top to think

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.200
it's more likely than not,

01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:29.320
but I'm not an expert on that physical evidence

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.120
and I'm gonna leave that part to someone else.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:33.600
I'm gonna say the prior is pretty high,

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.920
this isn't a crazy scenario.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:38.120
So then I can elaborate on where my prior comes from.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.360
What scenario could make most sense of this data?

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:46.520
My scenario to make sense has two main parts.

01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.280
First is panspermia siblings.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:53.280
So panspermia is the hypothesized process

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.480
by which life might have arrived on earth from elsewhere.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.480
And a plausible time for that,

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:01.200
I mean, it would have had to happen very early

01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.480
in earth's history because we see life early in history.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.360
And a plausible time could have been

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:08.560
during this stellar nursery where the sun was born

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:12.560
with many other stars in the same close proximity,

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.200
with lots of rocks flying around,

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.840
able to move things from one place to another.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.840
Pans, if a rock with life on it

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.080
from some rock planet with life

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.600
came into that stellar nursery,

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:27.960
it plausibly could have seeded many planets

01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:30.120
in that stellar nursery, all at the same time.

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.680
They're all born at the same time in the same place,

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.440
pretty close to each other, lots of rocks flying around.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.560
Okay, so a panspermia scenario would then create siblings,

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.560
i.e. there would be say a few thousand other planets

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.760
out there, so after the nursery forms, it drifts,

01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.440
it separates, they drift apart.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.040
And so out there in the galaxy,

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:51.680
there would now be a bunch of other stars

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.920
all formed at the same time,

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.760
and we can actually spot them in terms of their spectrum.

01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.800
And they would have then started on the same path of life

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.000
as we did with that life being seeded,

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.160
but they would move at different rates.

01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.760
And most likely most of them would never

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.520
reach an advanced level before the deadline,

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:15.240
but maybe one other did and maybe it did before us.

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.960
So if they did, they could know all of this

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.720
and they could go searching for their siblings.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:23.320
That is, they could look in the sky for the other stars

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:25.760
that match the spectrum that matches the spectrum

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.040
that came from this nursery.

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.280
They could identify their sibling stars in the galaxy,

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:33.480
the thousand of them, and those would be of special interest

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.520
to them because they would think,

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:36.480
well, life might be on those.

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:39.560
And they could go looking for them.

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:43.200
Can we just, such a brilliant mathematical,

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.200
philosophical, physical, biological idea

01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.520
of Panspermia's siblings,

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.080
because we all kind of started at a similar time

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.120
in this local pocket of the universe.

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:02.960
And so that changes a lot of the math.

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.600
So that would make, create this correlation

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.120
between when advanced life might appear.

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:09.240
No longer just random independent spaces and space time.

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.920
There'd be this cluster perhaps.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.520
And that allows interaction between

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:15.040
the elements of the cluster, yes.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.360
Non-grabby alien civilizations,

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:21.680
like kind of primitive alien civilizations,

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.720
like us with others.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.560
And they might be a little bit ahead.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.040
That's so fascinating.

01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:28.480
They would probably be a lot ahead.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.480
So the puzzle is, if they've happened before us,

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:35.400
they probably happened hundreds

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.200
of millions of years before us.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:38.720
But less than a billion.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.360
Less than a billion, but still plenty of time

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.720
that they could have become grabby

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.600
and filled the galaxy and gone beyond.

01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.520
So there'd be plenty.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:49.120
So the fact is they chose not to become grabby.

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:51.240
That would have to be the interpretation.

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:52.080
If we have Panspermia's siblings.

01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.280
Plenty of time to become grabby, you said.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:55.120
So they should be calling them.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.080
Yes, they had plenty of time and they chose not to.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.320
Are we sure about this?

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.960
So a hundred million years is enough.

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.000
A hundred million.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.320
So I told you before that I said within 10 million years,

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:09.040
our descendants will become grabby or not.

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.480
And they'll have that choice.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.320
Okay. Right.

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.760
And so they clearly more than 10 million years

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.600
earlier than us.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.360
So they chose not to.

01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:20.480
But still go on vacation, look around, just not grabby.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.160
If they chose not to expand,

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.520
that's going to have to be a rule they set

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.400
to not allow any part of themselves to do it.

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.840
Like if they let any little ship fly away

01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:33.800
with the ability to create a colony, the game's over.

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:37.400
Then they have prevented, then the universe becomes grabby

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.240
from their origin with this one colony, right?

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.320
So in order to prevent their civilization being grabby,

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.520
they have to have a rule they reinforced pretty strongly

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:47.080
that no part of them can ever try to do that.

01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:50.000
Through a global authoritarian regime

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.920
or through something that's internal to them,

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.920
meaning it's part of the nature of life

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.240
that it doesn't want, as I've come advanced-

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.520
Like a political officer in the brain or whatever.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:04.560
Yes. There's something in human nature

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:08.800
that prevents you from, or like alien nature

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.640
that as you get more advanced,

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:13.480
you become lazier and lazier in terms of exploration

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:14.680
and expansion.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.200
So I would say they would have to have enforced a rule

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:20.800
against expanding, and that rule would probably

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.360
make them reluctant to let people leave very far.

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.960
Any one vacation trip far away could risk an expansion

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.200
from this vacation trip.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.040
So they would probably have a pretty tight lid

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.200
on just allowing any travel out from their origin

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.800
in order to enforce this rule.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.440
But then we also know, well,

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.720
they would have chosen to come here.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.920
So clearly they made an exception from their general rule

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.920
to say, okay, but an expedition to earth,

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.240
that should be allowed.

01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.360
It could be intentional exception

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.760
or incompetent exception.

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:55.320
But if incompetent, then they couldn't maintain this

01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.720
over a hundred million years,

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.840
this policy of not allowing any expansion.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.160
So we have to see, they have successfully,

01:43:01.160 --> 01:43:02.840
they not just had a policy to try,

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.320
they succeeded over a hundred million years

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.680
in preventing the expansion.

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:10.040
That's substantial competence.

01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:11.560
Let me think about this.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:13.320
So you don't think there could be a barrier

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.720
in a hundred million years,

01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:16.720
you don't think there could be a barrier

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.640
to like technological barrier to becoming expansionary.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.240
Imagine the Europeans that tried to prevent anybody

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.080
from leaving Europe to go to the new world.

01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.040
And imagine what it would have taken

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.240
to make that happen over a hundred million years.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:38.000
Yeah, it's impossible.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:40.800
They would have had to have very strict,

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.200
guards at the borders around the water saying,

01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:44.280
no, you can't go.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.480
But just to clarify,

01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:49.080
you're not suggesting that's actually possible.

01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:51.360
I am suggesting it's possible.

01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:56.040
I don't know how you keep in my silly human brain.

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.800
Maybe it's a brain that values freedom,

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.760
but I don't know how you can keep

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.880
no matter how much force,

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.200
no matter how much censorship or control or so on.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:08.120
I just don't know how you can keep people

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:11.800
from exploring into the mysterious, into the unknown.

01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:13.560
You're thinking of people, we're talking aliens.

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:14.960
So remember there's a vast space

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.400
of different possible social creatures

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:17.520
they could have evolved from,

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.600
different cultures they could be in,

01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.520
different kinds of threats.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:23.000
I mean, there are many things as you talked about

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.800
that most of us would feel very reluctant to do.

01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:27.120
This isn't one of those, but.

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.120
Okay, so how, if the UFO sightings represent alien visitors,

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:33.960
how the heck are they getting here

01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:36.360
under the Panspermia siblings?

01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:39.080
So Panspermia siblings is one part of the scenario,

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:41.520
which is that's where they came from.

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.960
And from that we can conclude

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.520
they had this rule against expansion

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.960
and they've successfully enforced that.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.360
That also creates a plausible agenda

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.840
for why they would be here.

01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:52.720
That is to enforce that rule on us.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.840
That is if we go out and expanding,

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.080
then we have defeated the purpose of this rule they set up.

01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.480
Interesting. Right?

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.720
So they would be here to convince us to not expand.

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.200
Convince in quotes.

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.800
Right, through various mechanisms.

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.600
So obviously one thing we conclude

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.000
is they didn't just destroy us.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.280
That would have been completely possible, right?

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.920
So the fact that they're here and we are not destroyed

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:17.840
means that they chose not to destroy us.

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.600
They have some degree of empathy

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.040
or whatever their morals are

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.440
that would make them reluctant to just destroy us.

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.360
They would rather persuade us.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.800
Destroy their brethren.

01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:29.480
And so they may have been,

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.480
there's a difference in arrival and observation.

01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:34.600
They may have been observing for a very long time.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.440
Exactly.

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:40.440
And they arrived to try to, not to try.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.400
I don't think to ensure.

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:46.800
To ensure that we don't become grabby.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:49.240
Which is because that's, we can see that they did not.

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.320
They must've been forced to rule against that.

01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:53.680
And they are therefore here to,

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:55.320
that's a plausible interpretation,

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.840
why they would risk this expedition

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.080
when they clearly don't risk very many expeditions

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:01.400
over this long period to allow this one exception

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.320
because otherwise if they don't,

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.880
we may become grabby

01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:06.480
and they could have just destroyed us, but they didn't.

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.680
And they're closely monitoring

01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:10.920
the technological advancing of civilization.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920
Like what nuclear weapons is one thing that,

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:13.960
all right, cool.

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.360
That might have less to do with nuclear weapons

01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.160
and more with nuclear energy.

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.840
Maybe they're monitoring fusion closely.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:23.440
Like how clever are these apes getting?

01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:25.400
So no doubt they have a button

01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.800
that if we get too uppity or risky,

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.880
they can push the button and ensure that we don't expand.

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.480
But they'd rather do it some other way.

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:35.680
So now that explains why they're here

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.720
and why they aren't out there.

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.120
There's another thing that we need to explain.

01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.440
There's another key data we need to explain about UFOs

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:42.440
if we're gonna have a hypothesis that explains them.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.680
And this is something many people have noticed,

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.800
which is they had two extreme options

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:50.960
they could have chosen and didn't chose.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:53.960
They could have either just remained completely invisible.

01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.280
Clearly an advanced civilization

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.560
could have been completely invisible.

01:46:56.560 --> 01:46:59.120
There's no reason they need to fly around and be noticed.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:01.560
They could just be in orbit in dark satellites

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:03.200
that are completely invisible to us

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.320
watching whatever they wanna watch.

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.680
That would be well within their abilities.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:07.800
That's one thing they could have done.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.960
The other thing they could do is just show up

01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:12.240
and land on the White House lawn as they say

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:15.160
and shake hands, like make themselves really obvious.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.960
They could have done either of those

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:18.240
and they didn't do either of those.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.320
That's the next thing you need to explain

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.360
about UFOs as aliens.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.480
Why would they take this intermediate approach

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.280
hanging out near the edge of visibility

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.840
with somewhat impressive mechanisms,

01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:29.720
but not walking up and introducing themselves

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:31.600
nor just being completely invisible?

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.840
So, okay, a lot of questions there.

01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:38.720
So one, do you think it's obvious where the White House is

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:39.560
or the White House lawn?

01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:41.720
Well, it's obvious where there are concentrations of humans

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.560
that you could go up and introduce yourself to.

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:46.120
But is humans the most interesting thing about Earth?

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.040
Yeah.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:47.880
Are you sure about this?

01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.480
Because if they're worried about an expansion,

01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:53.160
then they would be worried about a civilization

01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:54.680
that could be capable of expansion.

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.680
Obviously humans are the civilization on Earth

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:59.800
that's by far the closest to being able to expand.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.880
I just don't know if aliens obviously see,

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.480
obviously see humans, like the individual humans,

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.920
like the organ of the meat vehicles

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.920
as the center of focus for observing a life on a planet.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:21.840
They're supposed to be really smart and advanced.

01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:23.760
This shouldn't be that hard for them.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:26.280
But I think we're actually the dumb ones

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.240
because we think humans are the important things,

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:30.760
but it could be our ideas,

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:33.040
it could be something about our technologies.

01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:34.640
That's mediated with us, that's correlated with us.

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.640
No, we make it seem like it's mediated by us humans.

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:43.440
But the focus for alien civilizations

01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:47.320
might be the AI systems or the technologies themselves.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:49.080
That might be the organism.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.840
Like humans are like, human is the food,

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.000
the source of the organism that's under observation

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.680
versus like...

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.480
The what they wanted to have close contact with

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.480
was something that was closely near humans,

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.600
then they would be contacting those

01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.080
and we would just incidentally see,

01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.200
but we would still see.

01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.360
But don't you think, isn't it possible,

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.080
taking their perspective,

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.160
isn't it possible that they would want to interact

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.560
with some fundamental aspect that they're interested in

01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.040
without interfering with it?

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.200
And that's actually a very,

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.600
no matter how advanced you are, it's very difficult to do.

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.800
But that's puzzling.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:30.840
So, I mean, the prototypical UFO observation

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:35.600
is a shiny, big object in the sky

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.320
that has very rapid acceleration

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:43.320
and no apparent surfaces for using air to manipulate at speed.

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:50.160
And the question is why that, right?

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.000
Again, if they just, for example,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.800
if they just wanted to talk to our computer systems,

01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:56.520
they could like move some sort of like a little probe

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:57.920
that like connects to a wire

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.560
and like reads and sends bits there,

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.000
they don't need a shiny thing flying in the sky.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.840
But I don't think they would be looking for

01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:09.040
the right way to communicate,

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:11.080
the right language to communicate.

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:14.360
Everything you just said, looking at the computer systems,

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.920
I mean, that's not a trivial thing.

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.880
Coming up with a signal that us humans

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:22.760
would not freak out too much about,

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.440
but also understand might not be that trivial.

01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.280
How would you talk to them?

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.120
Well, so the not freaking out apart

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.600
is another interesting constraint.

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.760
So again, I said, like the two obvious strategies

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:33.120
are just to remain completely invisible and watch,

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:34.320
which would be quite feasible,

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.760
or to just directly interact.

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:39.440
Let's come out and be really very direct, right?

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:41.560
I mean, there's big things that you can see around,

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.560
there's big cities, there's aircraft carriers,

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.280
there's lots of, if you wanted to just find a big thing

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.920
and come right up to it and like tap it on the shoulder

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.440
or whatever, that would be quite feasible,

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:52.120
then they're not doing that.

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:56.160
So my hypothesis is that,

01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:58.480
one of the other questions there was,

01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:59.560
do they have a status hierarchy?

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.400
And I think most animals on earth,

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.080
or social animals have status hierarchy.

01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:06.760
And they would reasonably presume

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.320
that we have a status hierarchy.

01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:10.480
And-

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.440
Take me to your leader.

01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.360
Well, I would say their strategy is to be impressive

01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:17.320
and sort of get us to see them

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.120
at the top of our status hierarchy.

01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:23.680
Just to, you know, that's how, for example,

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.680
we domesticate dogs, right?

01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:29.120
We convince dogs we're the leader of their pack, right?

01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.840
And we domesticate many animals that way,

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.200
but as we just swap into the top of their status hierarchy

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.840
and we say, we're your top status animal,

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:39.640
so you should do what we say, you should follow our lead.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:42.160
So the idea that would be,

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.440
they are going to get us to do what they want

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:48.600
by being top status.

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.080
You know, all through history, kings and emperors, et cetera,

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:53.360
have tried to impress their citizens and other people

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.400
by having the bigger palace, the bigger parade,

01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:57.560
the bigger crown and diamonds, right?

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.360
Whatever, maybe building a bigger pyramid, et cetera.

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:02.440
It's a very well-established trend

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.000
to just be high status

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:05.840
by being more impressive than the rest.

01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.520
To push back when there's an order of,

01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:11.680
several orders of magnitude of power differential,

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.280
asymmetry of power.

01:52:13.320 --> 01:52:15.840
I feel like that status hierarchy no longer applies.

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:17.480
It's like memetic theory.

01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.320
It's like-

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.280
Most emperors are several orders of magnitude

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.080
more powerful than any one member of their empire.

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:25.880
Let's increase that by even more.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.360
So like, if I'm interacting with ants,

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:34.120
I no longer feel like I need to establish my power with ants.

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.640
I actually want to lessen,

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:39.720
I want to lower myself to the ants.

01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:42.480
I want to become the lowest possible ant

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.600
so that they would welcome me.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:47.000
So I'm less concerned about them worshiping me.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.280
I'm more concerned about them welcoming me,

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:50.120
integrating me to their world.

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:51.760
But it is important that you be non-threatening

01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.680
and that you be local.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:53.520
So I think, for example,

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:56.200
if the aliens had done something really big in the sky,

01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:59.880
100 light years away, that would be there, not here.

01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:01.320
And that could seem threatening.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:03.760
So I think their strategy to be the high status

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.160
would have to be to be visible,

01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:06.680
but to be here and non-threatening.

01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:09.480
I just don't know if it's obvious how to do that.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:11.080
Like, take your own perspective.

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:15.880
You see a planet with relatively intelligent,

01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:18.400
like complex structures being formed,

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.240
like, yeah, life forms.

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.840
We could see this under in Titan or something like that.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.400
The moon, you know, Europa.

01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:30.000
You start to see not just primitive bacterial life,

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:31.320
but multicellular life.

01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:33.640
And it seems to form some very complicated

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:38.640
cellular colonies, structures that they're dynamic.

01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:40.400
There's a lot of stuff going on.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:45.400
Some gigantic cellular automata type of construct.

01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:50.080
How do you make yourself known to them

01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:54.640
in an impressive fashion without destroying it?

01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:56.920
Like, we know how to destroy, potentially.

01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:57.760
Right.

01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:01.160
So if you go touch stuff, you're likely to hurt it, right?

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.560
There's a good risk of hurting something

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.080
by getting too close and touching it and interacting, right?

01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.960
Yeah, like landing on a White House lawn.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:07.800
Right.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.400
The claim is that their current strategy

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.720
of hanging out at the periphery of our vision

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.240
and just being very clearly physically impressive

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.360
with very clear physically impressive abilities

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:23.080
is at least a plausible strategy they might use

01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:25.480
to impress us and convince us sort of

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:28.160
we're at the top of their status hierarchy.

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:30.520
And I would say if they came closer,

01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:31.920
not only would they risk hurting us

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.800
in ways that they couldn't really understand,

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:36.400
but more plausibly, they would reveal things

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:37.760
about themselves we would hate.

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:41.080
So if you look at how we treat other civilizations

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.880
on earth and other people, we are generally, you know,

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.800
interested in foreigners and people from other plant lands

01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.200
and we were generally interested

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.200
in their varying cult customs, et cetera,

01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.240
until we find out that they do something

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:55.800
that violates our moral norms and then we hate them.

01:54:56.880 --> 01:54:59.680
And these are aliens for God's sakes, right?

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.760
There's just gonna be something about them that we hate.

01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:04.520
They eat babies, who knows what it is.

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.920
It's something they don't think is offensive,

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:07.840
they think we might find.

01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.040
And so they would be risking a lot

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.720
by revealing a lot about themselves.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.720
We would find something we hated.

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:16.200
Interesting, but do you resonate at all

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:20.040
with mimetic theory where like we only feel this way

01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:21.920
about things that are very close to us?

01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.360
So aliens are sufficiently different

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:27.040
to where we'll be like fascinated, terrified or fascinated,

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:27.880
but not like annoyed.

01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:29.240
Right, but if they wanna be at the top

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.480
of our status hierarchy to get us to follow them,

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.800
they can't be too distant.

01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.440
They have to be close enough

01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:36.400
that we would see them that way.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.200
Pretend to be close enough, right?

01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:40.320
And not reveal much that mystery

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:43.200
that old Clint Eastwood cowboy say less.

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.440
I mean, the point is we're clever enough

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:46.840
that we can figure out their agenda.

01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.400
That is just from the fact that we're here.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.000
If we see that they're here, we can figure out,

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.640
oh, they want us not to expand.

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:53.800
And look, they are this huge power

01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:54.680
and they're very impressive.

01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.720
So, and a lot of us don't wanna expand.

01:55:56.720 --> 01:55:58.800
So that could easily tip us over the edge

01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:02.000
toward we already wanted to not expand.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.880
We already wanted to be able to regulate

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.600
and have a central community.

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:08.080
And here are these very advanced smart aliens

01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.080
who have survived for a hundred million years

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.920
and they're telling us not to expand either.

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.120
Jeff, this is brilliant.

01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:17.240
I love this so much.

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.560
Returning to parents spur me as siblings,

01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:22.960
just to clarify one thing.

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.840
In that framework, who originated, who planted it?

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:33.120
Would it be a grabby alien civilization

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.880
that planted the siblings or no?

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:38.800
The simple scenario is that life started

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:42.520
on some other planet billions of years ago

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:45.280
and it went through part of the stages of evolution

01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:48.160
to advance life, but not all the way to advance life.

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:51.000
And then some rock hit it, grabbed a piece of it

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.560
on the rock and that rock drifted for maybe

01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:55.320
in a million years until it happened

01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:57.120
to prong the stellar nursery

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.280
where it then seeded many stars.

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:01.400
And something about that life,

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:02.920
without being super advanced,

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.600
it was nevertheless resilient

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.600
to the harsh conditions of space.

01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.880
There's some graphs that I've been impressed by

01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:12.400
that show sort of the level of genetic information

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.120
in various kinds of life on the history of earth.

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.000
And basically we are now more complex than the earlier life,

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.680
but the earlier life was still pretty damn complex.

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:24.800
And so if you actually project this log graph in history,

01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:27.480
it looks like it was many billions of years ago

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.520
when you get down to zero.

01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.080
So like plausible, you could say

01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:32.200
there was just a lot of evolution that had to happen

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:34.760
before to get to the simplest life we've ever seen

01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.520
in history of life on earth was still pretty damn complicated.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:38.360
Okay.

01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.640
And so that race, that's always been this puzzle.

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:43.840
How could life get to this enormously complicated level

01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:46.400
in the short period it seems to

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:48.280
at the beginning of earth history?

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.400
So where, you know, it's only 300 million years at most

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.160
when it appeared and then it was really complicated

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:56.040
at that point.

01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:58.880
So Pansmermia allows you to explain that complexity

01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:01.880
by saying, well, it spent another five billion years

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.760
on another planet going through lots of earlier stages

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:07.440
where it was working its way up to the level of complexity

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.400
you see at the beginning of earth.

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:12.880
We'll try to talk about other ideas of the origin of life,

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.120
but let me return to UFO sightings.

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:18.640
Is there other explanations that are possible

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:22.240
outside of Pansmermia siblings that can explain

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:27.240
no grabby aliens in the sky and yet alien arrival on earth?

01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:31.200
Well, the other categories of explanations

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:33.800
that most people will use is, well, first of all

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.000
just mistakes like, you know, you're confusing

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.760
something ordinary for something mysterious, right?

01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:43.360
Or some sort of secret organization

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.920
like our government is secretly messing with us

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:48.840
and trying to do a, you know, a false flag ops

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:49.680
or whatever, right?

01:58:49.680 --> 01:58:51.520
You know, they're trying to convince the Russians

01:58:51.520 --> 01:58:53.120
or the Chinese that there might be aliens

01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.680
and scare them into not attacking or something, right?

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.480
Because if you, you know, the history of World War II

01:58:58.480 --> 01:59:02.680
say the US government did all these big fake operations

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:04.560
where they were faking a lot of big things

01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.720
in order to mess with people.

01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.040
So that's a possibility.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:09.680
The government's been lying and, you know, faking things

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:14.000
and paying people to lie about what they saw, et cetera.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.360
That's a plausible set of explanations

01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:19.000
for the range of sightings seen.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.560
And another explanation people offer

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:22.640
is some other hidden organization on earth.

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:25.360
There's some, you know, secret organization somewhere

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.200
that has much more advanced capabilities

01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:28.880
than anybody's given it credit for.

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:31.040
For some reason, it's been keeping secret.

01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:34.040
I mean, they all sound somewhat implausible,

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:35.480
but again, we're looking for maybe, you know,

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.800
one in a thousand sort of priors.

01:59:37.800 --> 01:59:40.520
Question is, you know, could they be

01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.840
in that level of plausibility?

01:59:42.840 --> 01:59:44.040
Can we just linger on this?

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:48.400
So you've, first of all, you've written, talked about,

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:51.280
thought about so many different topics.

01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:52.960
You're an incredible mind.

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:55.920
And I just thank you for sitting down today.

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:59.760
I'm almost like at a loss of which place we explore,

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:03.680
but let me, on this topic, ask about conspiracy theories,

02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:07.720
because you've written about institutions and authorities.

02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:14.160
What, this is a bit of a therapy session,

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:19.160
but what do we make of conspiracy theories?

02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:22.880
The phrase itself is pushing you in a direction, right?

02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:27.880
So clearly, in history, we've had many large coordinated

02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:29.120
keepings of secrets, right?

02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.600
Say the Manhattan Project, right?

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:32.360
And there was, what, hundreds of thousands of people

02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.400
working on that over many years,

02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:36.160
but they kept it a secret, right?

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.480
Clearly, many large military operations

02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:43.280
have kept things secrets over, you know, even decades

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:45.400
with many thousands of people involved.

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:48.640
So clearly, it's possible to keep some things secret

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.760
over time periods, you know,

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.480
but the more people you involve

02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:55.320
and the more time you're assuming

02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:58.840
and the more, the less centralized an organization

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.040
or the less discipline they have,

02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.440
the harder it gets to believe,

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:04.640
but we're just trying to calibrate basically in our minds

02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:06.840
which kind of secrets can be kept by which groups

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.880
over what time periods for what purposes, right?

02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:11.960
But let me, I don't have enough data,

02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:16.600
so I'm somebody, I, you know, I hang out with people

02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.400
and I love people, I love all things, really,

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:24.080
and I just, I think that most people, even the assholes,

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:27.040
have the capacity to be good and they're beautiful

02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:28.480
and I enjoy them.

02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:30.840
So the kind of data my brain,

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:32.400
whatever the chemistry of my brain is

02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.480
that sees the beautiful in things

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:37.840
is maybe collecting a subset of data

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:42.440
that doesn't allow me to intuit the competence

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:46.880
that humans are able to achieve

02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.480
in constructing a conspiracy theory.

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:52.080
So for example, one thing that people often talk about

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:53.400
is like intelligence agencies,

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:55.360
this like broad thing they say,

02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:58.920
the CIA, the FSB, the different, the British intelligence.

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:02.000
I've, fortunate or unfortunate enough,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.800
never gotten a chance that I know of

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.440
to talk to any member of those intelligence agencies

02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:13.400
nor like take a peek behind the curtain

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.600
or the first curtain,

02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.600
I don't know how many levels of curtains there are,

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.120
I can't intuit, but my interactions with government,

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:24.440
I was funded by DOD and DARPA and I've interacted,

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.680
been to the Pentagon,

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:30.760
with all due respect to my friends,

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:32.160
lovely friends in government

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:34.160
and there are a lot of incredible people,

02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:37.200
but there is a very giant bureaucracy

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.680
that sometimes suffocates the ingenuity of the human spirit

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.160
is one way I can put it.

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:45.920
Meaning they are, I just,

02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.800
it's difficult for me to imagine extreme competence

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:52.560
at a scale of hundreds or thousands of human beings.

02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:53.800
Now that doesn't mean,

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:56.960
that's my very anecdotal data of the situation.

02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.640
And so I try to build up my intuition

02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.920
about centralized system of government,

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.920
how much conspiracy is possible,

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:12.240
how much the intelligence agencies or some other source

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:16.480
can generate sufficiently robust propaganda

02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:18.440
that controls the populace.

02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:21.800
If you look at World War II, as you mentioned,

02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:25.400
there have been extremely powerful propaganda machines

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:28.360
on the side of Nazi Germany,

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.280
on the side of the Soviet Union,

02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.360
on the side of the United States

02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:35.800
and all these different mechanisms.

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:38.680
Sometimes they control the free press

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:40.240
through social pressures.

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:43.000
Sometimes they control the press

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
through the threat of violence,

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.160
as you do in authoritarian regimes.

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:50.280
Sometimes it's like deliberately the dictator

02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:53.160
like writing the news, the headlines

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:54.480
and literally announcing it.

02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:59.480
And something about human psychology forces you

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:05.080
to embrace the narrative and believe the narrative.

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:09.680
And at scale that becomes reality when the initial spark

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:13.320
was just a propaganda thought in a single individual's mind.

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:18.320
So I can't necessarily intuit of what's possible,

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:23.400
but I'm skeptical of the power of human institutions

02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.520
to construct conspiracy theories

02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:28.920
that cause suffering at scale,

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.800
especially in this modern age,

02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:33.360
when information is becoming more and more accessible

02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.480
by the populace.

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:37.760
Anyway, I don't know if you can elucidate further.

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:39.040
It's hard to suffer at scale,

02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:40.640
but of course, say during wartime,

02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.280
the people who are managing the various conspiracies

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:45.320
like D-Day or Manhattan Project,

02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:49.240
they thought that their conspiracy was avoiding harm

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.040
rather than causing harm.

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.560
So if you can get a lot of people to think

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:56.320
that supporting the conspiracy is helpful,

02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.760
then a lot more might do that.

02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:00.280
And there's just a lot of things

02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:02.960
that people just don't wanna see.

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.960
So if you can make your conspiracy the sort of thing

02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:06.880
that people wouldn't wanna talk about anyway,

02:05:06.880 --> 02:05:08.640
even if they knew about it,

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:10.800
you're most of the way there.

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:13.040
So I have learned many, over the years,

02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:15.320
many things that most ordinary people

02:05:15.320 --> 02:05:16.320
should be interested in,

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:17.360
but somehow don't know

02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:19.640
even though the data has been very widespread.

02:05:19.640 --> 02:05:21.760
So I have this book, The Elephant and the Brain,

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:23.960
and one of the chapters is there on medicine.

02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:27.160
And basically, most people seem ignorant

02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:29.880
of the very basic fact that when we do randomized trials

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:32.560
where we give some people more medicine than others,

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.960
the people who get more medicine are not healthier.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.120
Just overall, in general,

02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:39.680
just induce somebody to get more medicine

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:42.880
because you just give them more budget to buy medicine, say.

02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:45.840
Not a specific medicine, just the whole category.

02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.400
And you would think that would be something

02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.120
most people should know about medicine.

02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:51.960
You might even think that would be a conspiracy theory

02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:53.160
to think that would be hidden,

02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.920
but in fact, most people never learn that fact.

02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:00.880
So just to clarify, just a general high-level statement,

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:04.360
the more medicine you take, the less healthy you are.

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.320
Randomized experiments don't find that fact.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.200
Do not find that more medicine makes you more healthy.

02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:11.520
They're just no connection.

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:13.600
In randomized experiments,

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.520
there's no relationship between more medicine

02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.280
and being healthy. So it's not a negative relationship,

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.760
but it's just no relationship.

02:06:19.760 --> 02:06:21.000
Right.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:25.080
And so the conspiracy theory would say

02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.080
that the businesses that sell you medicine

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:28.640
don't want you to know that fact.

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:32.080
And then you're saying that there's also part of this

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:33.880
is that people just don't wanna know.

02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:35.240
And so they don't learn this.

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:37.520
So I've lived in the Washington area

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.760
for several decades now,

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.480
reading the Washington Post regularly.

02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.800
Every week there was a special section on health and medicine.

02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:47.400
It never was mentioned in that section of the paper

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.480
in all the 20 years I read that.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:50.840
So do you think there is some truth

02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:54.120
to this caricatured blue pill, red pill,

02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:57.360
where most people don't want to know the truth?

02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.280
There are many things about which people

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.960
don't want to know certain kinds of truths.

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:02.800
Yeah.

02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.680
That is bad-looking truths,

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:06.600
truths that discouraging,

02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:09.000
truths that sort of take away the justification

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.280
for things they feel passionate about.

02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:14.160
Do you think that's a bad aspect of human nature?

02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:16.360
That's something we should try to overcome?

02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:18.920
Well, as we discussed,

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:21.560
my first priority is to just tell people about it,

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.560
to do the analysis and the cold facts

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:24.640
of what's actually happening,

02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:27.200
and then to try to be careful about how we can improve.

02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:28.920
So our book, The Elephant in the Rain,

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.240
co-authored with Kevin Simmler,

02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:33.320
is about hidden motives in everyday life.

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:36.040
And our first priority there is just to explain to you

02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.320
what are the things that you are not looking at

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:40.480
that you are reluctant to look at.

02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.240
And many people try to take that book as a self-help book

02:07:43.240 --> 02:07:44.760
where they're trying to improve themselves

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:46.800
and make sure they look at more things,

02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:47.880
and that often goes badly

02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:51.200
because it's harder to actually do that than you think.

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:52.040
Yeah.

02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:54.040
And so we at least want you to know

02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:57.160
that this truth is available if you want to learn about it.

02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:58.000
It's the Nietzsche,

02:07:58.000 --> 02:07:59.520
if you gaze long into the abyss,

02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.320
the abyss gazes into you.

02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:03.560
Let's talk about this elephant in the brain.

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:07.840
Amazing book, The Elephant in the Room,

02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:09.360
is quote, an important issue

02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:10.960
that people are reluctant to acknowledge

02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:12.960
or address a social taboo.

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:15.440
The elephant in the brain is an important

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.480
but unacknowledged feature of how our mind works,

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:21.360
an introspective taboo.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:25.400
You describe selfishness and self-deception

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.760
as the core or some of the core elephants,

02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:33.480
as some of the elephants, elephant offspring in the brain.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:35.640
Selfishness and self-deception.

02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:39.240
All right, can you explain,

02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:43.920
can you explain why these are the taboos in our brain

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:48.040
that we don't want to acknowledge to ourselves?

02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:51.040
Your conscious mind, the one that's listening to me

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:52.520
that I'm talking to at the moment.

02:08:52.520 --> 02:08:53.360
Allegedly.

02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:54.480
You like to think of yourself

02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:57.000
as the president or king of your mind,

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.120
ruling over all that you see,

02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.520
issuing commands that immediately obeyed.

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.760
You are instead better understood

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.720
as the press secretary of your brain.

02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:11.640
You don't make decisions, you justify them to an audience.

02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:14.560
That's what your conscious mind is for.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.760
You watch what you're doing,

02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:20.160
and you try to come up with stories

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:21.480
that explain what you're doing

02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:24.840
so that you can avoid accusations of violating norms.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:28.280
So humans compared to most other animals have norms,

02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:30.640
and this allows us to manage larger groups

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:33.560
with our morals and norms about what we should

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.000
or shouldn't be doing.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.560
This is so important to us

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.000
that we needed to be constantly watching what we were doing

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.560
in order to make sure we had a good story

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.080
to avoid norm violations.

02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:45.960
So many norms are about motives.

02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:47.760
So if I hit you on purpose,

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.680
that's a big violation.

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.840
If I hit you accidentally, that's okay.

02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:53.120
I need to be able to explain why it was an accident

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.040
and not on purpose.

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:57.080
So where does that need come from

02:09:57.080 --> 02:09:59.000
for your own self-preservation?

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.600
Right, so humans have norms,

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:03.200
and we have the norm that if we see anybody violating a norm,

02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.240
we need to tell other people and then coordinate

02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:09.280
to make them stop and punish them for violating.

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:12.240
So such pen offence are strong enough and severe enough

02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:15.880
that we each want to avoid being successfully accused

02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:16.840
of violating norms.

02:10:17.880 --> 02:10:20.600
So for example, hitting someone on purpose

02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:22.280
is a big, clear norm violation.

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:24.800
If we do it consistently, we may be thrown out of the group

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.320
and that would mean we would die.

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.160
That's right.

02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:29.480
Okay, so we need to be able to convince people

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.560
we are not going around hitting people on purpose.

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:35.400
If somebody happens to be at the other end of our fist

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.280
and their face connects, that was an accident

02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.280
and we need to be able to explain that.

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.760
And similarly for many other norms humans have,

02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:46.240
we are serious about these norms

02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:48.160
and we don't want people to violate.

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:49.960
We find them violating, we're going to accuse them.

02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.440
But many norms have a motive component

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.360
and so we are trying to explain ourselves

02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:57.320
and make sure we have a good motive story

02:10:57.320 --> 02:10:59.160
about everything we do,

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:01.400
which is why we're constantly trying

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.280
to explain what we're doing

02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280
and that's what your conscious mind is doing.

02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:07.520
It is trying to make sure you've got a good motive story

02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:08.760
for everything you're doing.

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:11.280
And that's why you don't know why you really do things.

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.920
What you know is what the good story is

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.480
about why you've been doing things.

02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.360
And that's the self-deception.

02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:19.400
And you're saying that there's a machine,

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:22.720
the actual dictator is selfish.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:24.560
And then you're just the press secretary

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:26.480
who's desperately doesn't want to get fired

02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.160
and is justifying all of the decisions of the dictator.

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.280
And that's the self-deception.

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:35.360
Right, now most people actually are willing to believe

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.760
that this is true in the abstract.

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:39.240
So our book has been classified as psychology

02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:40.920
and it was reviewed by psychologists

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:43.880
and the basic way that psychology referees

02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:47.120
and reviewers responded is to say, this is well-known.

02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.880
Most people accept that there's a fair bit

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:49.720
of self-deception.

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.040
But they don't want to accept it about themselves.

02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:52.880
Well, they don't want to accept it

02:11:52.880 --> 02:11:55.160
about the particular topics that we talk about.

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.800
So people accept the idea in the abstract

02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.160
that they might be self-deceived

02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.920
or that they might not be honest about various things.

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.200
But that hasn't penetrated into the literatures

02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:06.000
where people are explaining particular things

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.440
like why we go to school, why we go to the doctor,

02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.120
why we vote, et cetera.

02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:13.080
So our book is mainly about 10 areas of life

02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.160
and explaining about in each area

02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:17.760
what our actual motives there are.

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.640
And people who study those things have not admitted

02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.400
that hidden motives are explaining

02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:25.480
those particular areas.

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:28.040
So they haven't taken the leap from theoretical psychology

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.240
to actual public policy.

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:31.080
Exactly.

02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:32.720
And economics and all that kind of stuff.

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.000
Well, let me just linger on this

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:40.000
and bring up my old friends, Zingman Freud and Carl Jung.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:46.400
So how vast is this landscape of the unconscious mind

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.800
the power and the scope of the dictator?

02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:53.600
Is it only dark there?

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.640
Is it some light?

02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:56.800
Is there some love?

02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.400
The vast majority of what's happening in your head

02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.600
you are unaware of.

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.800
So in a literal sense, the unconscious,

02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:06.720
the aspects of your mind that you're not conscious of

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:08.320
is the overwhelming majority.

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:11.920
But that's just true in a literal engineering sense.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:13.880
Your mind is doing lots of low-level things

02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:15.560
and you just can't be consciously aware

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.800
of all that low-level stuff.

02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.120
But there's plenty of room there

02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.120
for lots of things you're not aware of.

02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.960
But can we try to shine a light

02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:26.120
at the things we're unaware of specifically?

02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:28.680
Now again, staying with the philosophical psychology side

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:32.840
for a moment, can you shine a light in the Jungian shadow?

02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.640
What's going on there?

02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:37.400
What is this machine like?

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:40.480
Like what level of thoughts are happening there?

02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:43.360
Is it something that we can even interpret?

02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.040
If we somehow could visualize it,

02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.720
is it something that's human interpretable?

02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.360
Or is it just a kind of chaos

02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:52.320
of like monitoring different systems in the body,

02:13:52.320 --> 02:13:54.040
making sure you're happy,

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:57.680
making sure you're fed all those kinds of basic forces

02:13:57.680 --> 02:13:59.920
that form abstractions on top of each other

02:13:59.920 --> 02:14:01.840
and they're not introspective at all?

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:04.000
We humans are social creatures.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Plausibly being social is the main reason

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.880
we have these unusually large brains.

02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:10.960
Therefore, most of our brain is devoted to being social.

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:14.400
And so the things we are very obsessed with

02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:16.720
and constantly paying attention to are,

02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:18.920
how do I look to others?

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:20.520
What would others think of me

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.280
if they knew these various things they might learn about me?

02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:25.120
So that's close to being fundamental

02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.600
to what it means to be human,

02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:28.080
is caring what others think.

02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:31.440
Right, to be trying to present a story

02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:33.280
that would be okay for what other things,

02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:35.360
but we're very constantly thinking

02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.800
what do other people think?

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:39.960
So let me ask you this question then about you,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:44.760
Robin Hansen, who in many places,

02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:45.760
sometimes for fun,

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:49.440
sometimes as a basic statement of principle,

02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:53.240
likes to disagree with what the majority of people think.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.280
So how do you explain,

02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.280
how are you self-deceiving yourself in this task

02:15:01.280 --> 02:15:03.160
and how are you being self,

02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:06.600
how's your, like why is the dictator manipulating you

02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:08.760
inside your head to be so critical?

02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:10.240
Like there's norms,

02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:13.600
why do you wanna stand out in this way?

02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.600
Why do you want to challenge the norms in this way?

02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:16.680
Almost by definition,

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:19.720
I can't tell you what I'm deceiving myself about,

02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:22.440
but the more practical strategy that's quite feasible

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.800
is to ask about what are typical things

02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:26.760
that most people disease themselves about

02:15:26.760 --> 02:15:29.400
and then to own up to those particular things.

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:32.080
Sure, what's a good one?

02:15:32.080 --> 02:15:35.360
So for example, I can very much acknowledge

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:38.560
that I would like to be well thought of,

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.360
that I would be seeking attention and glory and praise

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:47.440
from my intellectual work

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:49.360
and that that would be a major agenda

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:51.840
driving my intellectual attempts.

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:55.960
So if there were topics that other people

02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:57.400
would find less interesting,

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.840
I might be less interested in those for that reason.

02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.200
For example, I might want to find topics

02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:03.040
where other people are interested

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:06.680
and I might want to go for the glory

02:16:06.680 --> 02:16:10.600
of finding a big insight rather than a small one

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:15.520
and maybe one that was especially surprising.

02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.880
That's also of course consistent

02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:18.960
with some more ideal concept

02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:20.680
of what an intellectual should be,

02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:25.120
but most intellectuals are relatively risk averse.

02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.560
They are in some local intellectual tradition

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.160
and they are adding to that

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.160
and they are staying conforming

02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:33.800
to the sort of usual assumptions

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:36.320
and usual accepted beliefs and practices

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.080
of a particular area

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:40.600
so that they can be accepted in that area

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:43.320
and treated as part of the community.

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.400
But you might think for the purpose

02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:49.160
of the larger intellectual project

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:51.200
of understanding the world better,

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:53.240
people should be less eager

02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:55.520
to just add a little bit to some tradition

02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.280
and they should be looking for what's neglected

02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:59.440
between the major traditions and major questions.

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:00.840
They should be looking for assumptions

02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.520
maybe we're making that are wrong.

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:04.400
They should be looking at ways,

02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:05.880
things that are very surprising

02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:08.080
like things that would be,

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:10.120
you would have thought a priori unlikely

02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:11.640
that once you are convinced of it,

02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:13.480
you find that to be very important

02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:16.200
and a big update, right?

02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:21.200
So you could say that one motivation I might have

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.360
is less motivated to be sort of comfortably accepted

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:28.320
into some particular intellectual community

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.760
and more willing to just go

02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:33.480
for these more fundamental long shots

02:17:33.480 --> 02:17:36.760
that should be very important if you could find them.

02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:39.680
Which would, if you can find them,

02:17:39.680 --> 02:17:43.720
would get you appreciated respect

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.960
across a larger number of people

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:49.040
across the longer time span of history.

02:17:49.040 --> 02:17:49.880
Right.

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:52.840
So like maybe the small local community

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.720
will say you suck, you must conform

02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:00.320
but the larger community will see the brilliance

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:01.840
of you breaking out of the cage

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.360
into the small conformity into a larger cage.

02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.600
It's always a bigger, there's always a bigger cage

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:10.160
and then you'll be remembered by more.

02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:14.320
Yeah, also that explains your choice of colorful shirt

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:15.880
that looks great in a black background.

02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:17.960
So you definitely stand out.

02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:18.800
Right.

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:20.880
Now, of course, you know, you could say,

02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:22.560
well, you could get all this attention

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.680
by making false claims of dramatic improvement

02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:28.520
and then wouldn't that be much easier

02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:30.240
than actually working through all the details.

02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.080
Why not?

02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:32.120
True claims, right.

02:18:32.120 --> 02:18:34.880
Let me ask the press secretary, why not?

02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:37.680
Why, so of course you spoke several times

02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.640
about how much you value truth and the pursuit of truth.

02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.240
That's a very nice narrative.

02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:43.080
Right.

02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:46.480
Hitler and Stalin also talked about the value of truth.

02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.440
Do you worry when you introspect

02:18:49.440 --> 02:18:52.880
as broadly as all humans might,

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:54.800
that it becomes a drug?

02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.280
This being a martyr

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:03.640
being the person who points out

02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:05.760
that the emperor wears no clothes,

02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:09.280
even when the emperor is obviously dressed,

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.360
just to be the person who points out

02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.760
that the emperor is wearing no clothes.

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:15.960
Do you think about that?

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:22.760
So I think the standards you hold yourself to

02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:25.360
are dependent on the audience you have in mind.

02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:28.080
So if you think of your audience

02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.480
as relatively easily fooled or relatively gullible,

02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.360
then you won't bother to generate more complicated,

02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:39.200
deep arguments and structures and evidence

02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.240
to persuade somebody who has higher standards

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:43.520
because why bother?

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:46.320
You can get away with something much easier.

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:49.120
And of course, if you are say a sales person,

02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.400
or you make money on sales,

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:53.480
then you don't need to convince the top few percent

02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:54.680
of the most sharp customers.

02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:57.440
You can just go for the bottom 60%

02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.640
of the most gullible customers

02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:01.000
and make plenty of sales, right?

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.280
So I think intellectuals have to vary.

02:20:05.280 --> 02:20:06.720
One of the main ways intellectuals varies

02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.440
in who is their audience in their mind.

02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:10.840
Who are they trying to impress?

02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.440
Is it the people down the hall?

02:20:12.440 --> 02:20:14.840
Is it the people who are reading their Twitter feed?

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.320
Is it their parents?

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:17.960
Is it their high school teacher?

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.360
Or is it Einstein and Freud and Socrates, right?

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:27.560
So I think those of us who are especially arrogant,

02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:31.040
especially think that we're really big shot

02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:33.120
or have a chance at being a really big shot,

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.880
we were naturally gonna pick the big shot audience

02:20:35.880 --> 02:20:36.720
that we can.

02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:39.520
We're gonna be trying to impress Socrates and Einstein.

02:20:39.520 --> 02:20:41.680
Is that why you're hanging out with Tyler Cohen a lot?

02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:42.800
Sure, I mean.

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:44.040
Try to convince him and stuff.

02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:45.640
You know, and you might think,

02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:47.480
from the point of view of just making money

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:49.360
or having sex or other sorts of things,

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:52.560
this is misdirected energy, right?

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:56.760
Trying to impress the very most highest quality minds,

02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:57.920
that's such a small sample

02:20:57.920 --> 02:21:00.280
and they can't do that much for you anyway.

02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:04.640
So I might well have had more ordinary success in life,

02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:07.320
be more popular, invited to more parties, make more money

02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:12.320
if I had targeted a lower tier set of intellectuals

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.560
with the standards they have.

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:17.160
But for some reason I decided early on

02:21:17.160 --> 02:21:20.640
that Einstein was my audience or people like him

02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:23.280
and I was gonna impress them.

02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:27.120
Yeah, I mean, you pick your set of motivations.

02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:28.880
Convincing, impressing Tyler Cohen

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:30.800
is not gonna help you get laid.

02:21:30.800 --> 02:21:32.360
Trust me, I tried.

02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:33.200
All right.

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:39.760
What are some notable sort of effects

02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:43.560
of the elephant in the brain in everyday life?

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:46.840
So you mentioned when we tried to apply that

02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:49.140
to economics, to public policy,

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:51.100
so when we think about medicine, education,

02:21:51.100 --> 02:21:51.940
all those kinds of things,

02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:53.340
what are some things that we can do?

02:21:53.340 --> 02:21:55.780
Well, the key thing is medicine is much less useful

02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:57.140
health-wise than you think.

02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:01.300
So if you were focused on your health,

02:22:01.300 --> 02:22:03.380
you would care a lot less about it

02:22:03.380 --> 02:22:05.160
and if you were focused on other people's health,

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.740
you would also care a lot less about it.

02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:09.420
But if medicine is, as we suggest,

02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:10.580
more about showing that you care

02:22:10.580 --> 02:22:13.180
and let other people showing that they care about you,

02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:16.100
then a lot of priority on medicine can make sense.

02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:19.300
So that was our very earliest discussion in the podcast.

02:22:19.300 --> 02:22:22.140
You were talking about should you give people

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:24.100
a lot of medicine when it's not very effective?

02:22:24.100 --> 02:22:25.780
And then the answer then is,

02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:27.900
well, if that's the way that you show that you care

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:31.140
about them and you really want them to know you care,

02:22:31.140 --> 02:22:33.220
then maybe that's what you need to do

02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:36.180
if you can't find a cheaper, more effective substitute.

02:22:36.180 --> 02:22:39.500
So if we actually just pause on that for a little bit,

02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:43.200
how do we start to untangle the full set

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:46.760
of self-deception happening in the space of medicine?

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:48.840
So we have a method that we use in our book

02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.640
that is what I recommend for people

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.240
to use in all these sorts of topics.

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:54.240
The straightforward method is first,

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:57.480
don't look at yourself, look at other people,

02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:00.600
look at broad patterns of behavior in other people

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.760
and then ask, what are the various theories we could have

02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:05.740
to explain these patterns of behavior?

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.280
And then just do the simple matching,

02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.960
which theory better matches the behavior they have.

02:23:10.960 --> 02:23:12.560
And the last step is to assume

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:13.720
that's true of you too.

02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.160
Don't assume you're an exception.

02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:19.040
If you happen to be an exception, that won't go so well,

02:23:19.040 --> 02:23:20.360
but nevertheless, on average,

02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.520
you aren't very well positioned to judge

02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:23.360
if you're an exception.

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:26.240
So look at what other people do,

02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:29.280
explain what other people do and assume that's you too.

02:23:29.280 --> 02:23:31.120
But also in the case of medicine,

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:34.440
there's several parties to consider.

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.000
So there's the individual person

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.520
that's receiving the medicine.

02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:40.120
There's the doctors that are prescribing the medicine.

02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:44.400
There's drug companies that are selling drugs.

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:46.040
There are governments that have regulations.

02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:46.960
There are lobbyists.

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:48.600
So you can build up a network

02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:51.920
of categories of humans in this

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:53.920
and they each play their role.

02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:58.920
So how do you introspect the sort of analyze the system

02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:03.840
at a system scale versus at the individual scale?

02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:06.120
So it turns out that in general,

02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:09.680
it's usually much easier to explain producer behavior

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:11.320
than consumer behavior.

02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:14.240
That is the drug companies or the doctors

02:24:14.240 --> 02:24:17.480
have relatively clear incentives to give the customers

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:19.280
whatever they want.

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:22.000
And similarly say governments in democratic countries

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.880
have the incentive to give the voters what they want.

02:24:24.880 --> 02:24:29.000
So that focuses your attention on the patient

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.640
and the voter in this equation and saying,

02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:33.040
what do they want?

02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:36.040
They would be driving the rest of the system.

02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:37.160
Whatever they want,

02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:39.480
the other parties are willing to give them

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:41.440
in order to get paid.

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:43.440
So now we're looking for puzzles

02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:46.040
in patient and voter behavior.

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:47.440
What are they choosing?

02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:49.240
And why do they choose that?

02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:52.760
And how much exactly?

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:54.840
And then we can explain that potentially again,

02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:56.360
returning to the producer,

02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:59.200
by the producer being incentivized to manipulate

02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.400
the decision-making processes of the voter

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:02.240
and the consumer.

02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:04.360
Well now in almost every industry,

02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:08.200
producers are in general happy to lie and exaggerate

02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:09.720
in order to get more customers.

02:25:09.720 --> 02:25:10.920
This is true of auto repair

02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.600
as much as human body repair and medicine.

02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:15.480
So the differences between these industries

02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:18.520
can't be explained by the willingness of the producers

02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:21.120
to give customers what they want or to do various things

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:23.520
that we have to again, go to the customers.

02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:26.440
Why are customers treating body repair

02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:27.800
different than auto repair?

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:34.560
Yeah, and that potentially requires a lot of thinking,

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.840
a lot of data collection,

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:38.080
and potentially looking at historical data too

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:40.400
because things don't just happen overnight,

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:41.520
over time there's trends.

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.360
In principle it does,

02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:45.520
but actually it's a lot easier than you might think.

02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:48.000
I think the biggest limitation is just the willingness

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.880
to consider alternative hypotheses.

02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:52.880
So many of the patterns that you need to rely on

02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:54.840
are actually pretty obvious simple patterns.

02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:57.360
You just have to notice them and ask yourself,

02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.320
how can I explain those?

02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:01.360
Often you don't need to look at the most subtle,

02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:05.560
most difficult statistical evidence that might be out there.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:08.600
The simplest patterns are often enough.

02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.800
All right, so there's a fundamental statement

02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:12.760
about self-deception in the book.

02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:14.080
There's the application of that,

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:15.920
like we just did in medicine.

02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:18.760
Can you steel man the argument

02:26:18.760 --> 02:26:23.240
that many of the foundational ideas in the book are wrong?

02:26:25.280 --> 02:26:29.560
Meaning there's two that you just made,

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.120
which is it can be a lot simpler than it looks.

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:37.240
Can you steel man the case that it's case by case,

02:26:37.240 --> 02:26:38.960
it's always super complicated.

02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:40.840
Like it's a complex system that's very difficult

02:26:40.840 --> 02:26:42.880
to have a simple model about.

02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:44.200
It's very difficult to introspect.

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:46.520
And the other one is that the human brain

02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:50.160
isn't not just about self-deception,

02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.360
that there's a lot of motivation to play

02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:59.720
and we are able to really introspect our own mind.

02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:02.360
And like what's on the surface of the conscious

02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:04.640
is actually quite a good representation

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:06.400
of what's going on in the brain.

02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:07.880
And you're not deceiving yourself.

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.440
You're able to actually arrive to deeply think about

02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:14.200
where your mind stands and what you think about the world.

02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.960
And it's less about impressing people

02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:19.520
and more about being a free thinking individual.

02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:23.840
So when a child tries to explain

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:26.520
why they don't have their homework assignment,

02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:30.400
they are sometimes inclined to say the dog ate my homework.

02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:33.120
They almost never say the dragon ate my homework.

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:35.760
The reason is the dragon

02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:39.080
is a completely implausible explanation.

02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:41.720
Almost always when we make excuses for things,

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.240
we choose things that are at least in some degree plausible.

02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:46.840
It could perhaps have happened.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.200
That's an obstacle for any explanation of a hidden motive

02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:54.720
or a hidden feature of human behavior.

02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:57.280
If people are pretending one thing

02:27:57.280 --> 02:27:58.520
while really doing another,

02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:00.360
they're usually gonna pick as a pretense

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:02.160
something that's somewhat plausible.

02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.920
That's gonna be an obstacle to proving that hypothesis

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:10.280
if you are focused on sort of the local data

02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:13.080
that a person would typically have if they were challenged.

02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.480
So if you're just looking at one kid

02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:15.680
and his lack of homework,

02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:19.800
maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate his homework or not.

02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:22.000
If you happen to know he doesn't have a dog,

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.680
you might have more confidence, right?

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:26.800
You will need to have a wider range of evidence

02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:28.360
than a typical person would

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.440
when they're encountering that actual excuse

02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:33.480
in order to see past the excuse.

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.560
That will just be a general feature of it.

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:38.880
So if I say there's this usual story

02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:39.960
about where we go to the doctor

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:42.680
and then there's this other explanation,

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.960
it'll be true that you'll have to look at wider data

02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:49.280
in order to see that because people don't usually offer

02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:52.480
excuses unless in the local context of their excuse,

02:28:52.480 --> 02:28:54.040
they can get away with it.

02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.840
That is, it's hard to tell, right?

02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:58.320
So in the case of medicine,

02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:00.920
I have to point you to sort of larger sets of data.

02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:06.880
But in many areas of academia, including health economics,

02:29:06.880 --> 02:29:09.920
the researchers there also want to support

02:29:09.920 --> 02:29:11.800
the usual points of view.

02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:14.240
And so they will have selection effects

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:17.560
in their publications and their analysis whereby they,

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.440
if they're getting a result too much contrary

02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:21.360
to the usual point of view everybody wants to have,

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:25.400
they will file drawer that paper or redo the analysis

02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:28.240
until they get an answer that's more to people's liking.

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.560
So that means in the health economics literature,

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:34.480
there are plenty of people who will claim that in fact,

02:29:34.480 --> 02:29:37.920
we have evidence that medicine is effective.

02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:40.440
And when I respond, I will have to point you

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.640
to our most reliable evidence

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:45.880
and ask you to consider the possibility

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:47.480
that the literature is biased

02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:50.160
in that when the evidence isn't as reliable,

02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.560
when they have more degrees of freedom

02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:53.200
in order to get the answer they want,

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.960
they do tend to get the answer they want.

02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:57.440
But when we get to the kind of evidence

02:29:57.440 --> 02:29:59.520
that's much harder to mess with,

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.360
that's where we will see the truth be more revealed.

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.560
So with respect to medicine,

02:30:05.560 --> 02:30:08.440
we have millions of papers published in medicine

02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:11.040
over the years, most of which give the impression

02:30:11.040 --> 02:30:12.520
that medicine is useful.

02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:16.960
There's a small literature on randomized experiments

02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.200
of the aggregate effects of medicine

02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:22.880
where there's maybe a few half dozen or so papers

02:30:23.880 --> 02:30:26.440
where it would be the hardest to hide it

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:29.560
because it's such a straightforward experiment

02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:32.400
done in a straightforward way

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:36.040
that it's hard to manipulate.

02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:37.720
And that's where I will point you to,

02:30:37.720 --> 02:30:40.080
to show you that there's relatively little correlation

02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:40.920
between health and medicine.

02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:44.480
But even then, people could try to save the phenomenon

02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:45.720
and say, well, it's not hidden motives,

02:30:45.720 --> 02:30:46.560
it's just ignorance.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:50.680
They could say, for example, medicine's complicated,

02:30:50.680 --> 02:30:53.320
most people don't know the literature,

02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:56.840
therefore they can be excused for ignorance.

02:30:56.840 --> 02:30:59.680
They are just ignorantly assuming that medicine is effective.

02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:01.400
It's not that they have some other motive

02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.960
that they're trying to achieve.

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.000
And then I will have to do,

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.160
as with a conspiracy theory analysis,

02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:09.960
and I'm saying, well,

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:12.520
how long has this misperception been going on?

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:14.400
How consistently has it happened

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:16.360
around the world and across time?

02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:19.680
And I would have to say, look,

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.080
if we're talking about, say, a recent new product,

02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:25.480
like Segway scooters or something,

02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:27.760
I could say not so many people have seen them or used them.

02:31:27.760 --> 02:31:29.880
Maybe they could be confused about their value.

02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.120
If we're talking about a product

02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:32.880
that's been around for thousands of years,

02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:35.240
used in roughly the same way all across the world,

02:31:35.240 --> 02:31:38.360
and we see the same pattern over and over again,

02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:41.920
this sort of ignorance mistake just doesn't work so well.

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:46.920
It also is a question of how much of the self-deception

02:31:47.440 --> 02:31:50.560
is prevalent versus foundational,

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:52.520
because there's a kind of implied thing

02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:54.960
where it's foundational to human nature

02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:58.720
versus just a common pitfall.

02:31:59.640 --> 02:32:01.800
This is a question I have.

02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:05.760
So maybe human progress is made by people

02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:09.240
who don't fall into the self-deception.

02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:11.760
It's a baser aspect of human nature,

02:32:11.760 --> 02:32:14.840
but then you escape it easily if you're motivated.

02:32:15.840 --> 02:32:19.200
The motivational hypotheses about the self-deceptions

02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.200
are in terms of how it makes you look

02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:22.040
to the people around you.

02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:24.120
Again, the press secretary.

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:25.640
So the story would be,

02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:28.440
most people want to look good to the people around them.

02:32:29.640 --> 02:32:31.880
Therefore, most people present themselves in ways

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:34.840
that help them look good to the people around them.

02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:39.000
That's sufficient to say there would be a lot of it.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.400
It doesn't need to be 100%, right?

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:44.000
There's enough variety in people and in circumstances

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.120
that sometimes taking a contrarian strategy

02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:49.640
can be in the interest of some minority of the people.

02:32:49.640 --> 02:32:50.920
So I might, for example,

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:53.640
say that that's a strategy I've taken.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:57.840
I've decided that being contrarian on these things

02:32:57.840 --> 02:32:59.880
could be winning for me

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:02.880
in that there's a room for a small number of people like me

02:33:02.880 --> 02:33:05.400
who have these sort of messages

02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:07.080
who can then get more attention,

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:10.560
even if there's not room for most people to do that.

02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:14.280
And that can be explaining sort of the variety, right?

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:15.280
Some of you might say,

02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:17.520
look, just look at the most obvious things.

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:19.200
Most people would like to look good, right?

02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:20.040
In the sense of physically,

02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:21.360
just you look good right now.

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.200
You're wearing a nice suit.

02:33:22.200 --> 02:33:23.040
You have a haircut.

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:24.480
You shaved, right?

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:25.320
So, and we-

02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:26.160
Got my own hair, by the way.

02:33:26.160 --> 02:33:28.080
Okay, well then, all the more impressive.

02:33:28.080 --> 02:33:31.760
That's a counter-argument for your client.

02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:33.080
Right, now clearly,

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:34.240
clearly if we look at most people

02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:35.160
on their physical appearance,

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:37.840
clearly most people are trying to look somewhat nice, right?

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:41.080
They shower, they shave, they comb their hair,

02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:42.760
but we certainly see some people around

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:44.440
who are not trying to look so nice, right?

02:33:44.440 --> 02:33:46.880
Is that a big challenge, the hypothesis,

02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:48.040
that people wanna look nice?

02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:49.640
Not that much, right?

02:33:49.640 --> 02:33:53.800
We can see in those particular people's context,

02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:55.880
more particular reasons why they've chosen

02:33:55.880 --> 02:33:58.720
to be an exception to the more general rule.

02:33:58.720 --> 02:33:59.560
So the general rule

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:02.560
does reveal something foundational generally.

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:04.720
Right.

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:05.880
That's the way things work.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:06.880
Let me ask you,

02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:09.560
you wrote a blog post about the accuracy of authorities

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:12.560
since we're talking about this, especially in medicine.

02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:16.760
Just looking around us,

02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:19.000
especially during this time of the pandemic,

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:22.040
there's been a growing distrust of authorities,

02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:26.440
of institutions, even in the institution of science itself.

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:32.520
What are the pros and cons of authorities, would you say?

02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:35.880
So what's nice about authorities?

02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:37.880
What's nice about institutions?

02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.520
And what are their pitfalls?

02:34:40.680 --> 02:34:43.040
One standard function of authority

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:45.800
is as something you can defer to respectively

02:34:45.800 --> 02:34:48.520
without needing to seem too submissive

02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:53.520
or ignorant or gullible.

02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:59.680
That is, when you're asking what should I act on

02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:02.880
or what belief should I act on,

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:06.440
you might be worried if I chose something too contrarian,

02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:08.680
too weird, too speculative,

02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:11.200
that that would make me look bad,

02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:14.360
so I would just choose something very conservative.

02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:17.000
So maybe an authority lets you choose something

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:18.160
a little less conservative

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:21.120
because the authority is your authorization.

02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.920
The authority will let you do it and you can say,

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:25.640
and somebody says, why did you do that thing?

02:35:25.640 --> 02:35:27.680
And they say, the authority authorized it.

02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:29.960
The authority tells me I should do this.

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:31.520
Why aren't you doing it, right?

02:35:31.520 --> 02:35:34.600
So the authority is often pushing for the conservative.

02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:36.760
Well, no, the authority can do more.

02:35:36.760 --> 02:35:39.000
I mean, so for example, we just think about,

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.400
I don't know, in a pandemic even, right?

02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:42.240
You could just think,

02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:43.760
I'll just stay home and close all the doors

02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:44.800
or I'll just ignore it, right?

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:47.000
You could just think of just some very simple strategy

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.960
that might be defensible if there were no authorities, right?

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:54.080
But authorities might be able to know more than that.

02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:55.840
They might be able to like look at some evidence,

02:35:55.840 --> 02:35:58.280
draw a more context dependent conclusion,

02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:00.520
declare it as the authority's opinion,

02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.760
and then other people might follow that.

02:36:01.760 --> 02:36:03.640
And that could be better than doing nothing.

02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:06.080
So what you mentioned, WHO,

02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:08.640
the world's most beloved organization.

02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:15.480
So this is me speaking in general, WHO and CDC has been,

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:20.760
depending on degrees and details,

02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:27.960
just not behaving as I would have imagined

02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:30.520
in the best possible evolution

02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:33.200
of human civilization, authorities should act.

02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:36.920
They seem to have failed in some fundamental way

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:40.880
in terms of leadership in a difficult time for our society.

02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:43.200
Can you say what are the pros and cons

02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:45.320
of this particular authority?

02:36:45.320 --> 02:36:49.080
So again, if there were no authorities whatsoever,

02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:51.080
no accepted authorities,

02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:54.760
then people would sort of have to sort of randomly pick

02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:56.360
different local authorities

02:36:56.360 --> 02:36:57.560
who would conflict with each other

02:36:58.160 --> 02:36:59.400
and then they'd be fighting each other about that

02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:01.000
or just not believe anybody

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.920
and just do some initial default action

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.640
that you would always do without responding to context.

02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:08.600
So the potential gain of an authority

02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:11.600
is that they could know more than just basic ignorance.

02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:13.600
And if people followed them,

02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.280
they could both be more informed than ignorance

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:17.880
and all doing the same thing.

02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:20.280
So they're each protected from being accused

02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:21.120
or complained about.

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:23.200
That's the idea of an authority.

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:24.920
That would be the good idea.

02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.760
What's the con of that?

02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:27.600
Okay.

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:28.440
What's the negative?

02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:29.280
How does that go wrong?

02:37:29.280 --> 02:37:32.840
So the con is that if you think of yourself as the authority

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:35.920
and asking what's my best strategy as an authority,

02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:39.080
it's unfortunately not to be maximally informative.

02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:42.320
So you might think the ideal authority

02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:44.760
would not just tell you more than ignorance.

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.640
It would tell you as much as possible.

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.400
Okay.

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:49.800
It would give you as much detail

02:37:49.800 --> 02:37:53.440
as you could possibly listen to and manage to assimilate.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:56.240
And it would update that as frequently as possible

02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:58.880
or as frequently as you were able to listen and assimilate.

02:37:58.880 --> 02:38:02.040
And that would be the maximally informative authority.

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:04.960
The problem is there's a conflict

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.800
between being an authority or being seen as an authority

02:38:08.800 --> 02:38:10.960
and being maximally informative.

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:12.840
That was the point of my blog post

02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:15.440
that you're pointing out to here.

02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:18.920
That is, if you look at it from their point of view,

02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:22.840
they won't long remain the perceived authority

02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:27.840
if they are too incautious about how they use that authority.

02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:31.760
And one of the ways to be incautious

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:34.720
would be to be too informative.

02:38:34.720 --> 02:38:35.560
Okay.

02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:37.160
That's still in the pro column for me

02:38:37.160 --> 02:38:39.080
because you're talking about the tensions

02:38:39.080 --> 02:38:42.680
that are very data-driven and very honest.

02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.120
And I would hope that authorities struggle with that.

02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:49.160
How much information to provide to people

02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.800
to maximize outcomes.

02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:55.440
Now, I'm generally somebody that believes

02:38:55.440 --> 02:38:56.480
more information is better

02:38:56.480 --> 02:38:58.520
because I trust in the intelligence of people.

02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:02.960
But I'd like to mention a bigger con on authorities,

02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:04.240
which is the human question.

02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:07.840
This comes back to global government and so on,

02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:12.840
is that there's humans that sit in chairs during meetings

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.480
and those authorities, they have different titles.

02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:18.280
Humans form hierarchies.

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.840
And sometimes those titles get to your head a little bit

02:39:20.840 --> 02:39:23.120
and you start to want to think,

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:26.440
how do I preserve my control over this authority?

02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:28.600
As opposed to thinking through like,

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:31.000
what is the mission of the authority?

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.320
What is the mission of WHO and other such organization?

02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:37.800
And how do I maximize the implementation of that mission?

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:40.480
You start to think, well, I kind of like sitting

02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:42.680
in this big chair at the head of the table.

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:45.280
I'd like to sit there for another few years,

02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.040
or better yet, I want to be remembered

02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:50.360
as the person who in a time of crisis

02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:52.720
was at the head of this authority

02:39:52.720 --> 02:39:54.480
and did a lot of good things.

02:39:54.480 --> 02:39:59.480
So you stop trying to do good under what good means,

02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.160
given the mission of the authority,

02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:05.680
and you start to try to carve a narrative,

02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:06.880
to manipulate the narrative.

02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:09.960
First, in the meeting room, everybody around you,

02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:12.400
just a small little story you tell yourself,

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:15.600
the new interns, the managers,

02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:17.600
throughout the whole hierarchy of the company.

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:20.880
Everybody in the company or in the organization

02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:22.720
believes this narrative.

02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:27.720
Now you start to control the release of information,

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.080
not because you're trying to maximize outcomes,

02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:33.160
but because you're trying to maximize the effectiveness

02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:38.000
of the narrative that you are truly a great representative

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.120
of this authority in human history.

02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:42.920
And I just feel like those human forces,

02:40:42.920 --> 02:40:45.640
whenever you have an authority,

02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:48.080
it starts getting to people's heads.

02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:50.240
One of the most, me as a scientist,

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:52.120
one of the most disappointing things to see

02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:56.520
during the pandemic is the use of authority

02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:01.520
from colleagues of mine to roll their eyes,

02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:06.640
to dismiss other human beings just because they got a PhD,

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.880
just because they're an assistant associate, full faculty,

02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:16.880
just because they are deputy head of X organization, NIH,

02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:20.760
whatever the heck the organization is,

02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.040
just because they got an award of some kind.

02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:24.920
And at a conference,

02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.320
they won a best paper award seven years ago,

02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:31.200
and then somebody shook their hand and gave them a medal.

02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:32.520
Maybe it was a president.

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:35.000
And it's been 20, 30 years

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:36.880
that people have been patting them on the back,

02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:38.920
saying how special they are,

02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:40.720
especially when they are controlling money

02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.040
and getting sucked up from other scientists

02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:46.800
who really want the money in a self-deception kind of way.

02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:48.880
They don't actually really care about your performance.

02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:50.520
And all of that gets to your head.

02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.680
And no longer are you the authority

02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.160
that's trying to do good

02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:55.840
and lessen the suffering in the world.

02:41:55.840 --> 02:41:59.640
You become an authority that just wants to maximize,

02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:05.480
self-preserve yourself in a, sitting on a throne of power.

02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:08.880
So this is core to sort of what it is to be an economist.

02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:11.760
I'm a professor of economics.

02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:13.400
There you go with the authority again.

02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.240
No, so it's about saying-

02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.320
Just joking, yes.

02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:20.840
We often have a situation where we see a world of behavior,

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:23.720
and then we see ways in which particular behaviors

02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.080
are not sort of maximally socially useful.

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:28.120
Yes.

02:42:28.120 --> 02:42:31.760
And we have a variety of reactions to that.

02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:34.640
So one kind of reaction is to sort of morally blame

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:36.920
each individual for not doing

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:38.720
the maximally socially useful thing

02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:43.720
under perhaps the idea that people could be identified

02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:45.560
and shamed for that and maybe induced

02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:46.680
into doing the better thing

02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.080
if only enough people were calling them out on it, right?

02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:53.280
But another way to think about it is to think that people

02:42:53.280 --> 02:42:56.520
sit in institutions with certain,

02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:58.120
stable institutional structures

02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:00.720
and that institutions create particular incentives

02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:04.200
for individuals and that individuals are typically

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:07.280
doing whatever is in their local interest

02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:09.080
in the context of that institution.

02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:13.320
And then perhaps to less blame individuals

02:43:13.320 --> 02:43:15.960
for winning their local institutional game

02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:17.840
and more blaming the world

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:19.360
for having the wrong institutions.

02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:21.440
So economists are often wondering

02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:22.960
what other institutions we could have

02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:24.320
instead of the ones we have

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:26.160
and which of them might promote better behavior.

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:29.680
And this is a common thing we do all across human behavior

02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:32.080
is to think of what are the institutions we're in

02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:34.520
and what are the alternative variations we could imagine

02:43:34.520 --> 02:43:36.000
and then to say which institutions

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.280
would be most productive.

02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:42.080
I would agree with you that our information institutions,

02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:45.080
that is the institutions by which we collect information

02:43:45.080 --> 02:43:47.280
and aggregate it and share it with people

02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:52.040
are especially broken in the sense of far from the ideal

02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:54.520
of what would be the most cost-effective way

02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:56.760
to collect and share information.

02:43:56.760 --> 02:43:59.120
But then the challenge is to try to produce

02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:01.000
better institutions.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.840
And as an academic, I'm aware that academia

02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:06.840
is particularly broken in the sense

02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.720
that we give people incentives to do research

02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:12.000
that's not very interesting or important

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.320
because basically they're being impressive

02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:15.680
and we actually care more about

02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:17.040
whether academics are impressive

02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:19.280
than whether they're interesting or useful.

02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:23.600
And I can go happy to go into detail

02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:25.400
with lots of different known institutions

02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:27.120
and their known institutional failings,

02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:29.200
ways in which those institutions produce

02:44:29.360 --> 02:44:31.680
you know, incentives that are mistaken

02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:33.320
and that was the point of the post we started

02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:34.720
with talking about the authorities.

02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:37.640
If I need to be seen as an authority,

02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:40.600
that's at odds with my being informative

02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:42.840
and I might choose to be the authority

02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:43.880
instead of being informative

02:44:43.880 --> 02:44:46.280
because that's my institutional incentives.

02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:51.280
And if I may, I'd like to, given that beautiful picture

02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:56.000
of incentives and individuals that you just painted,

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.640
let me just apologize for a couple of things.

02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:03.680
One, I often put too much blame on leaders of institutions

02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.640
versus the incentives that govern those institutions.

02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:12.080
And as a result of that, I've been,

02:45:13.880 --> 02:45:17.480
I believe too critical of Anthony Fauci,

02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:20.920
too emotional about my criticism of Anthony Fauci.

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:22.840
And I'd like to apologize for that

02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:27.440
because I think there's deeper truths to think about.

02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:29.640
There's deeper incentives to think about.

02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:31.880
That said, I do sort of,

02:45:31.880 --> 02:45:34.360
I'm a romantic creature by nature.

02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:37.240
I romanticize Winston Churchill.

02:45:37.240 --> 02:45:42.240
And I, when I think about Nazi Germany,

02:45:42.600 --> 02:45:44.520
I think about Hitler more than I do

02:45:44.520 --> 02:45:46.960
about the individual people of Nazi Germany.

02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:49.400
You think about leaders, you think about individuals,

02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.080
not necessarily the parameters,

02:45:51.080 --> 02:45:54.400
the incentives that govern the system that,

02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:55.640
because it's harder.

02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:58.880
It's harder to think through deeply about the models

02:45:58.880 --> 02:46:00.640
from which those individuals arise,

02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.280
but that's the right thing to do so.

02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:07.880
But also I don't apologize for being emotional sometimes

02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:08.720
and being-

02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:11.080
I'm happy to blame the individual leaders

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:12.920
in the sense that, you know, I might say,

02:46:12.920 --> 02:46:15.200
well, you should be trying to reform these institutions

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:17.400
if you're just there to like get promoted

02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:19.120
and look good at being at the top.

02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:21.040
Or maybe I can blame you for your motives

02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:22.640
and your priorities in there.

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:24.760
But I can understand why the people at the top

02:46:24.760 --> 02:46:26.200
would be the people who are selected

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:28.200
for having the priority of primarily trying

02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:29.240
to get to the top.

02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:30.320
I get that.

02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:33.280
Can I maybe ask you about particular universities?

02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:38.040
They've received, like science has received an increase

02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:40.800
in distrust overall as an institution,

02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:44.840
which breaks my heart because I think science is beautiful

02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:47.240
as a, not maybe not as an institution,

02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:50.480
but as one of the things,

02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:54.560
one of the journeys that humans have taken on.

02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:55.840
The other one is university.

02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:58.640
I think university is actually a place,

02:46:58.640 --> 02:47:01.040
for me at least, in the way I see it,

02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:05.800
is a place of freedom of exploring ideas,

02:47:05.800 --> 02:47:08.200
scientific ideas, engineering ideas,

02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:13.880
more than a corporate, more than a company,

02:47:13.880 --> 02:47:15.640
more than a lot of domains in life.

02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:21.320
It's not just in its ideal, but in its implementation,

02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:24.560
a place where you can be a kid for your whole life

02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:25.960
and play with ideas.

02:47:25.960 --> 02:47:28.120
And I think with all the criticism

02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:32.160
that universities still not currently receive,

02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:34.520
I think they, I don't think that criticism

02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:36.360
is representative of universities.

02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:38.440
They focus on very anecdotal evidence

02:47:38.440 --> 02:47:40.760
of particular departments, particular people,

02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:44.240
but I still feel like there's a lot of place

02:47:44.240 --> 02:47:49.240
for freedom of thought, at least, you know, at MIT,

02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:52.880
at least in the fields I care about, you know,

02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.080
in particular kind of science,

02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.000
particular kind of technical fields, you know,

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.920
mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering,

02:48:01.920 --> 02:48:04.480
so robotics, artificial intelligence.

02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:06.600
This is a place where you get to be a kid.

02:48:06.600 --> 02:48:11.600
Yet, there is bureaucracy that's rising up.

02:48:13.320 --> 02:48:16.120
There's like more rules, there's more meetings,

02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:18.000
and there's more administration.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.360
Having like PowerPoint presentations,

02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:26.360
which to me, you should like be more of a renegade explorer

02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:32.760
of ideas and meetings destroy, they suffocate

02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:34.960
that radical thought that happens

02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:36.360
when you're an undergraduate student

02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:37.800
and you can do all kinds of wild things

02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:39.280
when you're a graduate student.

02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:40.640
Anyway, all that to say,

02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:42.160
you've thought about this aspect too.

02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:46.400
Is there something positive, insightful you could say

02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:50.320
about how we can make for better universities

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:51.360
in the decades to come?

02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:55.480
This particular institution, how can we improve them?

02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:59.200
I hear that centuries ago, many scientists

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:01.440
and intellectuals were aristocrats.

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:06.440
They had time and could, if they chose,

02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:07.800
choose to be intellectuals.

02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:12.160
That's a feature of the combination

02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:14.400
that they had some source of resources

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:18.440
that allowed them leisure and that the kind of competition

02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:21.800
they were faced in among aristocrats allowed

02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:24.960
that sort of a self-indulgence or self-pursuit

02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:27.000
at least at some point in their lives.

02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:33.920
So the analogous observation is that university professors

02:49:33.960 --> 02:49:37.080
often have sort of the freedom and space

02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:39.160
to do a wide range of things.

02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:41.960
And I am certainly enjoying that as a tenured professor.

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.800
You're a really, sorry to interrupt,

02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:47.080
a really good representative of that.

02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:48.640
Just the exploration you're doing,

02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.440
the depth of thought that most people are afraid

02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:55.600
to do the kind of broad thinking that you're doing,

02:49:55.600 --> 02:49:56.440
which is great.

02:49:56.440 --> 02:49:58.560
The fact that that can happen is a combination

02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:00.120
of these two things analogously.

02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:02.520
One is that we have fierce competition

02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:03.800
to become a tenured professor,

02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:05.160
but then once you become tenured,

02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:08.560
we give you the freedom to do what you like.

02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:10.720
And that's a happenstance.

02:50:10.720 --> 02:50:12.640
It didn't have to be that way.

02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:14.440
And in many other walks of life,

02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:17.160
even though people have a lot of resources, et cetera,

02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:18.640
they don't have that kind of freedom set up.

02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:23.320
So I think I'm kind of lucky that tenure exists

02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:25.480
and that I'm enjoying it.

02:50:25.480 --> 02:50:28.520
But I can't be too enthusiastic about this

02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:31.120
unless I can approve of sort of the source of the resources

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:32.520
that's paying for all this, right?

02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:33.400
So for the aristocrat,

02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:36.840
if you thought they stole it in war or something,

02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:38.040
you wouldn't be so pleased.

02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:39.600
Whereas if you thought they had earned it

02:50:39.600 --> 02:50:41.920
or their ancestors had earned this money

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:43.480
that they were spending as an aristocrat,

02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:45.360
then you could be more okay with that, right?

02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:48.920
So for universities, I have to ask,

02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:50.640
where are the main sources of resources

02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.160
that are going to the universities

02:50:52.160 --> 02:50:54.240
and are they getting their money's worth?

02:50:54.240 --> 02:50:58.320
Are they getting a good value for that payment, right?

02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.800
So first of all, they're students.

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:02.520
And the question is,

02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:05.040
are students getting good value for their education?

02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:07.960
And each person is getting value

02:51:07.960 --> 02:51:10.080
in the sense that they are identified

02:51:10.080 --> 02:51:12.600
and shown to be a more capable person,

02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:16.200
which is then worth more salary as an employee later.

02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:17.600
But there is a case for saying

02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:19.080
there's a big waste to the system

02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:22.560
because we aren't actually changing the students

02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:23.400
or educating them.

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:26.920
We're more sorting them or labeling them.

02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:30.320
And that's a very expensive process to produce that outcome.

02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:33.760
And part of the expense is the freedom from tenure, I guess.

02:51:33.760 --> 02:51:36.680
So I feel like I can't be too proud of that

02:51:36.680 --> 02:51:39.640
because it's basically a tax on all these young students

02:51:39.640 --> 02:51:41.320
to pay this enormous amount of money

02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:42.880
in order to be labeled as better,

02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:44.640
whereas I feel like we should be able

02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:47.160
to find cheaper ways of doing that.

02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:50.680
The other main customer is researcher patrons

02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:53.400
like the government or other foundations.

02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:54.240
And then the question is,

02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:56.080
are they getting their money worth out

02:51:56.080 --> 02:51:58.840
of the money they're paying for research to happen?

02:52:00.040 --> 02:52:03.480
And my analysis is they don't actually care

02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:04.700
about the research progress.

02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:06.540
They are mainly buying an affiliation

02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:07.900
with credentialed impressiveness

02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:09.660
on the part of the researchers.

02:52:09.660 --> 02:52:12.740
They mainly pay money to researchers who are impressive

02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:15.300
and have impressive affiliations,

02:52:15.300 --> 02:52:16.260
and they don't really much care

02:52:16.260 --> 02:52:19.020
what research project happens as a result.

02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:21.180
Is that a cynical?

02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:25.580
So there's a deep truth to that cynical perspective.

02:52:25.580 --> 02:52:29.980
Is there a less cynical perspective that they do care

02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:31.780
about the long-term investment

02:52:31.780 --> 02:52:34.500
into the progress of science and humanity?

02:52:35.340 --> 02:52:36.740
Well, they might personally care,

02:52:36.740 --> 02:52:38.900
but they're stuck in an equilibrium

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:42.660
wherein basically most foundations like governments

02:52:42.660 --> 02:52:46.260
or the Ford Foundation,

02:52:46.260 --> 02:52:50.740
the individuals there are rated based on the prestige

02:52:50.740 --> 02:52:52.740
they bring to that organization.

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:54.980
And even if they might personally want

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:56.420
to produce more intellectual progress,

02:52:56.420 --> 02:52:59.460
they are in a competitive game where they don't have tenure

02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:02.100
and they need to produce this prestige.

02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:04.020
Once they give grant money to prestigious people,

02:53:04.020 --> 02:53:05.340
that is the thing that shows

02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:07.540
that they have achieved prestige for the organization

02:53:07.540 --> 02:53:08.860
and that's what they need to do

02:53:08.860 --> 02:53:11.060
in order to retain their position.

02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:13.300
And you do hope that there's a correlation

02:53:13.300 --> 02:53:16.980
between prestige and actual competence?

02:53:16.980 --> 02:53:18.300
Of course, there is a correlation.

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:20.500
The question is just, could we do this better

02:53:20.500 --> 02:53:21.340
some other way?

02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:24.700
And I think it's pretty clear we could.

02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.220
What is harder to do is move the world

02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:29.740
to a new equilibrium where we do that instead.

02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:33.460
What are the components of the better ways to do it?

02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:36.820
Is it money?

02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:40.620
So how the sources of money and how the money is allocated

02:53:40.620 --> 02:53:44.500
to give the individual researchers freedom?

02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:47.460
Years ago, I started studying this topic exactly

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:48.780
because this was my issue

02:53:48.780 --> 02:53:51.740
and this was many decades ago now and I spent a long time

02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:55.340
and my best guess still is prediction markets,

02:53:55.340 --> 02:53:56.180
betting markets.

02:53:56.180 --> 02:54:00.380
So if you as a research patron want to know the answer

02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:01.860
to a particular question,

02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:04.260
like what's the mass of the electron neutrino,

02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:07.740
then what you can do is just subsidize a betting market

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:11.180
in that question and that will induce more research

02:54:11.180 --> 02:54:12.340
into answering that question

02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:14.340
because the people who then answer that question

02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:15.940
can then make money in that betting market

02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:17.900
with the new information they gain.

02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:21.420
So that's a robust way to induce more information

02:54:21.420 --> 02:54:22.260
on a topic.

02:54:22.260 --> 02:54:23.780
If you want to induce an accomplishment,

02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:25.700
you can create prizes and there's of course,

02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:29.660
a long history of prizes to induce accomplishments

02:54:29.660 --> 02:54:32.260
and we moved away from prizes,

02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:35.020
even though we once used them a far more often

02:54:35.020 --> 02:54:38.380
than we did today and there's a history to that.

02:54:39.940 --> 02:54:42.900
And for the customers who want to be affiliated

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:44.780
with impressive academics,

02:54:44.780 --> 02:54:46.340
which is what most of the customers want,

02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:48.460
students, journalists and patrons,

02:54:48.460 --> 02:54:50.100
I think there's a better way of doing that,

02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:54.660
which I just wrote about in my second most recent blog post.

02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:55.540
Can you explain?

02:54:55.540 --> 02:54:58.980
Sure, what we do today is we take sort of acceptance

02:54:58.980 --> 02:55:02.580
by other academics recently as our best indication

02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:04.260
of their deserved prestige.

02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:08.820
That is recent publications, recent job affiliation,

02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:12.900
institutional affiliations, recent invitations to speak,

02:55:12.900 --> 02:55:14.780
recent grants.

02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:19.060
We are today taking other impressive academics,

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.740
recent choices to affiliate with them

02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:24.020
as our best guesstimate of their prestige.

02:55:25.100 --> 02:55:28.300
I would say we could do better by creating betting markets

02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:30.700
in what the distant future will judge

02:55:30.700 --> 02:55:34.460
to have been their deserved prestige looking back on them.

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:37.260
I think most intellectuals, for example,

02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:39.860
think that if we look back two centuries,

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:42.780
say to intellectuals from two centuries ago

02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:45.700
and try to look in detail at their research

02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:47.460
and how it influenced future research

02:55:47.460 --> 02:55:49.220
and which path it was on,

02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:52.620
we could much more accurately judge

02:55:52.620 --> 02:55:55.260
their actual deserved prestige.

02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:57.060
That is who was actually on the right track,

02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.500
who actually helped, which will be different

02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:01.220
than what people at the time judged

02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:03.740
using the immediate indications of the time,

02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:04.860
or which position they had,

02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:07.580
or which publications they had, or things like that.

02:56:07.580 --> 02:56:10.780
In this way, if you think from the perspective

02:56:10.780 --> 02:56:12.700
of multiple centuries,

02:56:13.580 --> 02:56:17.380
you would higher prioritize true novelty

02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:20.980
and you would disregard the temporal proximity,

02:56:20.980 --> 02:56:23.060
like how recent the thing is,

02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:25.820
and you would think like, what is the brave,

02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:29.340
the bold, the big, novel idea that this,

02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:30.900
and you would actually...

02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:31.980
You would be able to rate that

02:56:31.980 --> 02:56:34.460
because you could see the path with which ideas took,

02:56:34.460 --> 02:56:35.540
which things had dead ends,

02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:37.060
which led to what other followings.

02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:40.140
You could, looking back centuries later,

02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:42.780
have a much better estimate of who actually had

02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:45.180
what long-term effects on intellectual progress.

02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:47.980
We actually pay people in several centuries

02:56:47.980 --> 02:56:49.500
to do this historical analysis,

02:56:49.500 --> 02:56:52.340
and we have prediction markets today

02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:53.940
where we buy and sell assets,

02:56:53.940 --> 02:56:55.300
which will later off pay off

02:56:55.300 --> 02:56:57.700
in terms of those final evaluations.

02:56:57.700 --> 02:56:59.540
So now we'll be inducing people today

02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:01.100
to make their best estimate of those things

02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:04.620
by actually looking at the details of people

02:57:04.620 --> 02:57:06.300
and setting the prices accordingly.

02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:07.540
So my proposal would be,

02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:10.220
we rate people today on those prices today.

02:57:10.220 --> 02:57:12.420
So instead of looking at their list of publications

02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:14.740
or affiliations, you look at the actual price

02:57:14.740 --> 02:57:17.900
of assets that represent people's best guess

02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:19.380
of what the future will say about them.

02:57:19.380 --> 02:57:20.220
That's brilliant.

02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:23.540
So this concept of idea futures,

02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:26.660
can you elaborate what this would entail?

02:57:27.780 --> 02:57:30.260
I've been elaborating two versions of it here.

02:57:30.260 --> 02:57:33.060
So one is, if there's a particular question,

02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:35.540
say the mass of the electron neutrino,

02:57:35.540 --> 02:57:37.180
and what you as a patron want to do

02:57:37.180 --> 02:57:39.780
is get an answer to that question,

02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:42.100
then what you would do is subsidize the betting market

02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:44.300
in that question under the assumption

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:45.860
that eventually we'll just know the answer

02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:47.700
and we can pay off the bets that way.

02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:48.540
Right.

02:57:48.540 --> 02:57:49.620
And that is a plausible assumption

02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:52.300
for many kinds of concrete intellectual questions

02:57:52.300 --> 02:57:53.900
like what's the mass of the electron neutrino.

02:57:53.900 --> 02:57:56.420
In this hypothetical world that you're constructing

02:57:56.420 --> 02:57:58.180
that may be a real world,

02:57:58.180 --> 02:58:01.220
do you mean literally financial?

02:58:01.220 --> 02:58:03.540
Yes, literal, very literal.

02:58:03.540 --> 02:58:06.940
Very cash, very direct and literal.

02:58:06.940 --> 02:58:07.780
Yes, so.

02:58:07.780 --> 02:58:09.100
Or crypto.

02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:10.780
Well, crypto is funny.

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:11.620
Yes, sure.

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:15.300
The idea would be research labs would be for profit.

02:58:15.300 --> 02:58:17.100
They would have as their expense

02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:18.660
paying researchers to study things,

02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:21.260
and then their profit would come from using the insights

02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:24.220
the researchers gains to trade in these financial markets.

02:58:25.580 --> 02:58:27.460
Just like hedge funds today make money

02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:29.820
by paying researchers to study firms

02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:32.500
and then making their profits by trading on those,

02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:34.340
that insight in the ordinary financial market.

02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:37.860
And the market would, if it's efficient,

02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:39.820
would be able to become better and better

02:58:39.820 --> 02:58:42.420
at predicting the powerful ideas

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:44.420
that the individual is able to generate.

02:58:44.420 --> 02:58:46.700
The variance around the mass of the electron neutrino

02:58:46.700 --> 02:58:48.540
would decrease with time as we learned

02:58:48.540 --> 02:58:50.060
that value of that parameter better

02:58:50.060 --> 02:58:52.660
and any other parameters that we wanted to estimate.

02:58:52.660 --> 02:58:54.620
You don't think those markets would also respond

02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:58.660
to recency of prestige and all those kinds of things?

02:58:58.660 --> 02:59:01.020
They would respond, but the question is

02:59:01.020 --> 02:59:02.740
if they might respond incorrectly,

02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:04.460
but if you think they're doing it incorrectly,

02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:08.180
you have a profit opportunity where you can go fix it.

02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:10.380
So we'd be inviting everybody to ask

02:59:10.380 --> 02:59:12.420
whether they can find any biases or errors

02:59:12.420 --> 02:59:14.220
in the current ways in which people are estimating

02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:15.780
these things from whatever clues they have.

02:59:15.780 --> 02:59:18.700
Right, there's a big incentive for the correction mechanism.

02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:22.420
In academia, currently, there's not,

02:59:22.420 --> 02:59:26.900
it's the safe choice to go with the prestige and there's no.

02:59:26.900 --> 02:59:31.020
Even if you privately think that the prestige is overrated.

02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:34.220
Even if you think strongly that it's overrated.

02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:36.740
Still, you don't have an incentive to defy that publicly.

02:59:36.740 --> 02:59:38.540
You're going to lose a lot,

02:59:38.540 --> 02:59:42.740
unless you're a contrarian that writes brilliant blogs

02:59:42.740 --> 02:59:45.620
and then you could talk about our podcast.

02:59:45.620 --> 02:59:48.140
Right, I mean, initially, this was my initial concept

02:59:48.140 --> 02:59:50.260
of having these betting markets on these key parameters.

02:59:50.260 --> 02:59:52.660
What I then realized over time was that

02:59:52.660 --> 02:59:54.540
that's more what people pretend to care about.

02:59:54.540 --> 02:59:58.220
What they really mostly care about is just who's how good.

02:59:58.220 --> 02:59:59.980
And that's what most of the system is built on

02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:01.900
is trying to rate people and rank them.

03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:04.100
And so I designed this other alternative

03:00:04.100 --> 03:00:06.500
based on historical evaluation centuries later

03:00:07.300 --> 03:00:09.300
of just about who's how good,

03:00:09.300 --> 03:00:11.060
because that's what I think most of the customers

03:00:11.060 --> 03:00:11.900
really care about.

03:00:13.980 --> 03:00:16.780
Customers, I like the word customers here, humans.

03:00:16.780 --> 03:00:19.220
Right, well, every major area of life,

03:00:19.220 --> 03:00:22.020
which has specialists who get paid to do that thing,

03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:23.780
must have some customers from elsewhere

03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:25.380
who are paying for it.

03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:28.260
Well, who are the customers for the mass of the neutrino?

03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:32.140
Yes, I understand, in a sense,

03:00:32.140 --> 03:00:36.380
people who are willing to pay for a thing.

03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:38.980
I understand about anything, who are the customers?

03:00:38.980 --> 03:00:39.820
And what's the product?

03:00:39.820 --> 03:00:44.340
Like medicine, education, academia, military, et cetera.

03:00:44.340 --> 03:00:45.980
That's part of the hidden motives analysis.

03:00:45.980 --> 03:00:48.500
Often people have a thing they say about what the product is

03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:49.340
and who the customer is,

03:00:49.340 --> 03:00:51.180
and maybe you need to dig a little deeper

03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:52.940
to find out what's really going on.

03:00:52.940 --> 03:00:55.020
Or a lot deeper.

03:00:55.020 --> 03:01:00.020
You've written that you seek out, quote, viewquakes.

03:01:00.180 --> 03:01:02.940
You're able, as an intelligent black box

03:01:02.940 --> 03:01:04.420
word generating machine,

03:01:04.420 --> 03:01:06.140
you're able to generate a lot of sexy words.

03:01:06.180 --> 03:01:07.540
I like it, I love it.

03:01:07.540 --> 03:01:10.620
Viewquakes, which are insights

03:01:10.620 --> 03:01:14.900
which dramatically changed my world view, your world view.

03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:18.900
You write, I loved science fiction as a child,

03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:21.040
studied physics and artificial intelligence

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:22.660
for a long time each,

03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:25.660
and now study economics and political science,

03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:28.780
all fields full of such insights.

03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:31.980
So, let me ask, what are some viewquakes

03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:34.640
or a beautiful, surprising idea to you

03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:36.280
from each of those fields?

03:01:36.280 --> 03:01:38.920
Physics, AI, economics, political science.

03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:40.320
I know it's a tough question.

03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:43.200
Something that springs to mind about physics, for example,

03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:44.280
that just is beautiful.

03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:45.600
I mean, right from the beginning,

03:01:45.600 --> 03:01:48.360
say, special relativity was a big surprise.

03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:51.680
Most of us have a simple concept of time,

03:01:51.680 --> 03:01:53.240
and it seems perfectly adequate

03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:55.000
for everything we've ever seen.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.520
And to have it explained to you

03:01:56.520 --> 03:01:58.760
that you need to sort of have a mixture concept

03:01:58.760 --> 03:01:59.640
of time and space,

03:01:59.640 --> 03:02:02.120
where you put it into the space-time construct,

03:02:02.120 --> 03:02:05.080
how it looks different from different perspectives,

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:06.640
that was quite a shock.

03:02:06.640 --> 03:02:10.040
And that was such a shock that it makes you think,

03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:13.400
what else do I know that isn't the way it seems?

03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:15.160
Certainly, quantum mechanics is certainly

03:02:15.160 --> 03:02:17.520
another enormous shock in terms of,

03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:20.580
from your point, you have this idea that there's a space

03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:23.440
and then there's particles at points

03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:25.140
and maybe fields in between.

03:02:26.100 --> 03:02:28.920
And quantum mechanics is just a whole different

03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:31.080
representation, it looks nothing like

03:02:31.080 --> 03:02:32.520
what you would have thought as sort of

03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:35.160
the basic representation of the physical world.

03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:36.880
And that was quite a surprise.

03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:39.000
What would you say is the catalyst

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:42.200
for the viewquake in theoretical physics

03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:43.760
in the 20th century?

03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:44.600
Where does that come from?

03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:46.000
So the interesting thing about Einstein,

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.600
it seems like a lot of that came from

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:49.200
almost thought experiments.

03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:51.860
It wasn't almost experimentally driven.

03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:56.480
And with, actually, I don't know

03:02:56.480 --> 03:02:58.280
the full story of quantum mechanics,

03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:01.520
how much of it is experiment, like where,

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:05.280
if you look at the full trace of idea generation there,

03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:08.720
of all the weird stuff that falls out of quantum mechanics,

03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:10.640
how much of that was the experimentalist,

03:03:10.640 --> 03:03:12.160
how much was it the theoreticians?

03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:14.000
But usually, in theoretical physics,

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.740
the theories lead the way.

03:03:15.740 --> 03:03:20.740
So maybe, can you elucidate what is the catalyst for these?

03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:24.540
The remarkable thing about physics

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:28.020
and about many other areas of academic intellectual life

03:03:28.020 --> 03:03:30.700
is that it just seems way over-determined.

03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:34.100
That is, if it hadn't been for Einstein

03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:36.100
or if it hadn't been for Heisenberg,

03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:37.860
certainly within a half a century,

03:03:37.860 --> 03:03:39.440
somebody else would have come up

03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:42.220
with essentially the same things.

03:03:42.220 --> 03:03:44.100
Is there something you believe or is there something?

03:03:44.100 --> 03:03:46.340
Yes, so I think when you look at

03:03:46.340 --> 03:03:49.460
just the history of physics and the history of other areas,

03:03:49.460 --> 03:03:52.400
some areas like that, there's just this enormous convergence

03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:53.980
that the different kind of evidence

03:03:53.980 --> 03:03:57.620
that was being collected was so redundant

03:03:57.620 --> 03:03:59.460
in the sense that so many different things

03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:02.100
revealed the same things that eventually,

03:04:02.100 --> 03:04:04.300
you just kind of have to accept it

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:06.580
because it just gets obvious.

03:04:06.580 --> 03:04:09.180
So if you look at the details, of course,

03:04:10.060 --> 03:04:11.760
Einstein did it for somebody else

03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:14.240
and it's well worth celebrating Einstein for that.

03:04:14.240 --> 03:04:17.500
And we, by celebrating the particular people

03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:19.980
who did something first or came across something first,

03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:23.320
we are encouraging all the rest to move a little faster,

03:04:24.700 --> 03:04:27.440
to try to push us all a little faster,

03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:30.880
which is great, but I still think

03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:33.320
we would have gotten roughly to the same place

03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:34.520
within a half century.

03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:37.080
So sometimes people are special

03:04:37.080 --> 03:04:39.440
because of how much longer it would have taken.

03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:41.040
So some people say general relativity

03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:43.900
would have taken longer without Einstein than other things.

03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:46.000
I mean, Heisenberg quantum mechanics,

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:47.440
I mean, there were several different formulations

03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:50.360
of quantum mechanics all around the same few years,

03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:52.920
means no one of them made that much of a difference.

03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:54.680
We would have had pretty much the same thing

03:04:54.680 --> 03:04:57.420
regardless of which of them did it exactly when.

03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:00.080
Nevertheless, I'm happy to celebrate them all.

03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:02.480
But this is a choice I make in my research.

03:05:02.480 --> 03:05:03.320
That is when there's an area

03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:06.000
where there's lots of people working together,

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.140
who are sort of scoping each other

03:05:08.140 --> 03:05:10.760
and getting a result just before somebody else does,

03:05:10.760 --> 03:05:14.080
you ask, well, how much of a difference would I make there?

03:05:14.080 --> 03:05:16.260
At most, I could make something happen a few months

03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:17.820
before somebody else.

03:05:17.820 --> 03:05:20.640
And so I'm less worried about them missing things.

03:05:20.640 --> 03:05:23.080
So when I'm trying to help the world like doing research,

03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:24.220
I'm looking for neglected things.

03:05:24.700 --> 03:05:26.180
I'm looking for things that nobody's doing it.

03:05:26.180 --> 03:05:28.180
If I didn't do it, nobody would do it.

03:05:28.180 --> 03:05:29.100
Nobody would do it.

03:05:29.100 --> 03:05:29.940
Or at least for a long time.

03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:31.540
In the next 10, 20 years kind of thing.

03:05:31.540 --> 03:05:32.740
Same with general relativity,

03:05:32.740 --> 03:05:35.140
just, you know, who would do it?

03:05:35.140 --> 03:05:37.500
It might take another 10, 20, 30, 50 years.

03:05:37.500 --> 03:05:39.740
So that's the place where you can have the biggest impact

03:05:39.740 --> 03:05:41.640
is finding the things that nobody would do

03:05:41.640 --> 03:05:43.340
unless you did them.

03:05:43.340 --> 03:05:47.220
And then that's when you get the big viewquake, the insight.

03:05:47.220 --> 03:05:49.460
So what about artificial intelligence?

03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:54.460
Would it be the EMs, the emulated minds?

03:05:54.620 --> 03:05:59.620
What idea, whether that struck you in the shower one day

03:06:01.140 --> 03:06:03.420
or are they you just-

03:06:03.420 --> 03:06:06.780
Clearly the biggest viewquake in artificial intelligence

03:06:06.780 --> 03:06:09.700
is the realization of just how complicated

03:06:09.700 --> 03:06:10.880
our human minds are.

03:06:10.880 --> 03:06:14.420
So most people who come to artificial intelligence

03:06:14.420 --> 03:06:17.820
from other fields or from relative ignorance,

03:06:17.860 --> 03:06:20.180
a very common phenomena which you must be familiar with

03:06:20.180 --> 03:06:22.420
is that they come up with some concept

03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:24.700
and then they think that must be it.

03:06:24.700 --> 03:06:27.220
Once we implement this new concept, we will have it.

03:06:27.220 --> 03:06:28.900
We will have full human level

03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:30.740
or higher artificial intelligence, right?

03:06:30.740 --> 03:06:34.260
And they're just not appreciating just how big the problem is,

03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:36.780
how long the road is, just how much is involved.

03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:38.700
Because that's actually hard to appreciate.

03:06:38.700 --> 03:06:41.660
When we just think, it seems really simple.

03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:43.740
And studying artificial intelligence,

03:06:43.740 --> 03:06:45.220
going through many particular problems,

03:06:45.220 --> 03:06:47.260
looking at each problem of all the different things

03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:49.980
you need to be able to do to solve a problem like that

03:06:49.980 --> 03:06:52.380
makes you realize all the things your minds are doing

03:06:52.380 --> 03:06:54.220
that you are not aware of.

03:06:54.220 --> 03:06:57.540
That's that vast subconscious that you're not aware.

03:06:57.540 --> 03:06:59.580
That's the biggest view came from artificial intelligence

03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:02.300
by far for most people who study artificial intelligence

03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:05.060
is to see just how hard it is.

03:07:05.060 --> 03:07:07.140
I think that's a good point.

03:07:07.140 --> 03:07:10.900
But I think it's a very early viewquake.

03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:15.900
It's when the Dunning-Kruger crashes hard

03:07:17.460 --> 03:07:19.540
it's the first realization that humans

03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:21.140
are actually quite incredible.

03:07:21.140 --> 03:07:23.180
The human mind, the human body is quite incredible.

03:07:23.180 --> 03:07:25.220
There's a lot of different parts to it.

03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:29.460
But then, see, it's already been so long for me

03:07:29.460 --> 03:07:31.100
that I've experienced that viewquake

03:07:31.100 --> 03:07:34.620
that for me, I now experience the viewquakes of,

03:07:34.620 --> 03:07:37.420
holy shit, this little thing is actually quite powerful.

03:07:37.420 --> 03:07:39.900
Like neural networks, I'm amazed.

03:07:39.900 --> 03:07:43.500
Because you've become almost cynical

03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:47.980
after that first viewquake of like, this is so hard.

03:07:47.980 --> 03:07:50.420
Like evolution did some incredible work

03:07:50.420 --> 03:07:52.220
to create the human mind.

03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:55.020
But then you realize, just like as you have,

03:07:55.020 --> 03:07:57.260
you've talked about a bunch of simple models

03:07:57.260 --> 03:08:01.100
that simple things can actually be extremely powerful.

03:08:01.100 --> 03:08:06.020
That maybe emulating the human mind is extremely difficult,

03:08:06.020 --> 03:08:08.860
but you can go a long way with a large neural network.

03:08:08.860 --> 03:08:11.020
You can go a long way with a dumb solution.

03:08:11.020 --> 03:08:12.140
It's that Stuart Russell thing

03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:14.100
with the reinforcement learning.

03:08:14.100 --> 03:08:17.460
Holy crap, you can go quite a long way with a simple thing.

03:08:17.460 --> 03:08:19.180
But we still have a very long road to go,

03:08:19.180 --> 03:08:20.660
but nevertheless.

03:08:20.660 --> 03:08:23.580
I can't, I refuse to sort of know.

03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:27.700
The road is full of surprises.

03:08:27.700 --> 03:08:30.500
So long is an interesting, like you said,

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:34.060
with the six hard steps that humans have to take

03:08:34.060 --> 03:08:37.580
to arrive at where we are from the origin of life on Earth.

03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:42.020
So it's long maybe in the statistical improbability

03:08:42.860 --> 03:08:44.540
of the steps that have to be taken.

03:08:44.540 --> 03:08:47.980
But in terms of how quickly those steps could be taken,

03:08:47.980 --> 03:08:50.780
I don't know if my intuition says

03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:53.540
if it's hundreds of years away

03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:57.460
or if it's a couple of years away.

03:08:57.460 --> 03:08:58.980
I prefer to measure.

03:08:58.980 --> 03:09:00.860
Pretty confidence, at least a decade.

03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:03.380
And mildly confidence, at least three decades.

03:09:03.380 --> 03:09:05.460
I can still man either direction.

03:09:05.460 --> 03:09:08.740
I prefer to measure that journey in Elon Musk's.

03:09:08.740 --> 03:09:09.700
That's a new.

03:09:09.700 --> 03:09:11.100
Well, we don't get Elon Musk very often.

03:09:11.140 --> 03:09:12.700
So that's a long time scale.

03:09:12.700 --> 03:09:15.580
For now, I don't know, maybe you can clone

03:09:15.580 --> 03:09:18.940
or maybe multiply or even know what Elon Musk,

03:09:18.940 --> 03:09:21.140
what that is, what is that?

03:09:21.140 --> 03:09:23.060
That's a good question, exactly.

03:09:23.060 --> 03:09:25.020
Well, that's an excellent question.

03:09:25.020 --> 03:09:28.100
How does that fit into the model of the three parameters

03:09:28.100 --> 03:09:33.100
that are required for becoming a grabby alien civilization?

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:35.940
That's the question of how much any individual makes

03:09:35.940 --> 03:09:38.780
in the long path of civilization over time.

03:09:38.780 --> 03:09:41.300
Yes, and it's a favorite topic of historians

03:09:41.300 --> 03:09:43.980
and people to try to focus on individuals

03:09:43.980 --> 03:09:45.260
and how much of a difference they make.

03:09:45.260 --> 03:09:48.100
And certainly some individuals make a substantial difference

03:09:48.100 --> 03:09:50.380
in the modest term, right?

03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:55.460
Certainly without Hitler being Hitler in the role he took,

03:09:55.460 --> 03:09:57.460
European history would have taken a different path

03:09:57.460 --> 03:09:59.300
for a while there.

03:09:59.300 --> 03:10:02.500
But if we're looking over many centuries longer term things,

03:10:02.500 --> 03:10:05.780
most individuals do fade in their individual influence.

03:10:06.780 --> 03:10:09.140
So, maybe- Even Einstein.

03:10:09.140 --> 03:10:13.860
Even Einstein, no matter how sexy your hair is,

03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:17.660
you will also be forgotten in the long arc of history.

03:10:17.660 --> 03:10:19.700
So you said at least 10 years.

03:10:19.700 --> 03:10:23.900
So let's talk a little bit about this AI point

03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:29.500
of how we achieve, how hard is the problem

03:10:29.500 --> 03:10:33.620
of solving intelligence by engineering

03:10:33.700 --> 03:10:38.060
artificial intelligence that achieves human level,

03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:41.260
human-like qualities that we associate with intelligence?

03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:42.100
How hard is this?

03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:45.220
What are the different trajectories that take us there?

03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:48.580
One way to think about it is in terms of the scope

03:10:48.580 --> 03:10:50.900
of the technology space you're talking about.

03:10:50.900 --> 03:10:53.500
So let's take the biggest possible scope,

03:10:53.500 --> 03:10:56.140
all of human technology, right?

03:10:56.140 --> 03:10:57.860
The entire human economy.

03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:02.340
So the entire economy is composed of many industries,

03:11:02.340 --> 03:11:03.660
each of which have many products

03:11:03.660 --> 03:11:06.420
with many different technologies supporting each one.

03:11:07.860 --> 03:11:12.860
At that scale, I think we can accept that most innovations

03:11:13.060 --> 03:11:14.580
are a small fraction of the total.

03:11:14.580 --> 03:11:18.180
That is usually has relatively gradual overall progress

03:11:19.540 --> 03:11:21.900
and that individual innovations

03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:24.580
that have a substantial effect, the total are rare

03:11:24.580 --> 03:11:27.460
and the total effect is still a small percentage

03:11:27.460 --> 03:11:28.980
of the total economy, right?

03:11:28.980 --> 03:11:30.740
There's very few individual innovations

03:11:30.740 --> 03:11:33.820
that made a substantial difference to the whole economy,

03:11:33.820 --> 03:11:34.660
right, what are we talking?

03:11:34.660 --> 03:11:37.980
Steam engine, shipping containers, a few things.

03:11:39.660 --> 03:11:41.940
Shipping containers deserves to be up there

03:11:41.940 --> 03:11:44.100
with steam engines, honestly.

03:11:44.100 --> 03:11:46.980
Can you say exactly why shipping containers?

03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:49.700
Shipping containers revolutionize shipping.

03:11:49.700 --> 03:11:51.180
Shipping is very important.

03:11:52.180 --> 03:11:55.420
But placing that as shipping containers.

03:11:55.420 --> 03:11:57.580
So you're saying you wouldn't have some of the magic

03:11:57.580 --> 03:11:59.180
of the supply chain and all that

03:11:59.180 --> 03:12:00.500
without shipping containers.

03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:02.220
That made a big difference, absolutely.

03:12:02.220 --> 03:12:05.100
Interesting, that's something we'll look into.

03:12:05.100 --> 03:12:07.940
We shouldn't take that tangent, although I'm tempted to.

03:12:07.940 --> 03:12:10.940
But anyway, so there's a few, just a few innovations.

03:12:10.940 --> 03:12:13.980
Right, so at the scale of the whole economy, right?

03:12:13.980 --> 03:12:17.420
Now, as you move down to a much smaller scale,

03:12:17.420 --> 03:12:19.460
you will see individual innovations

03:12:19.460 --> 03:12:21.220
having a bigger effect, right?

03:12:21.220 --> 03:12:24.900
So if you look at, I don't know, lawnmowers or something,

03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:26.140
I don't know about the innovations lawnmower,

03:12:26.140 --> 03:12:27.900
but there are probably like steps

03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:30.180
where you just had a new kind of lawnmower

03:12:30.180 --> 03:12:32.420
and that made a big difference to mowing lawns

03:12:33.540 --> 03:12:35.740
because you're focusing on a smaller part

03:12:35.740 --> 03:12:38.140
of the whole technology space, right?

03:12:38.140 --> 03:12:42.420
So, and you know, sometimes like military technology,

03:12:42.420 --> 03:12:43.860
there's a lot of military technologies,

03:12:43.860 --> 03:12:45.260
a lot of small ones, but every once in a while,

03:12:45.260 --> 03:12:48.980
a particular military weapon like makes a big difference.

03:12:48.980 --> 03:12:51.340
But still, even so, mostly overall,

03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:53.260
they're making modest differences

03:12:53.260 --> 03:12:55.860
to a something that's increasing relatively.

03:12:55.900 --> 03:12:58.540
Like U.S. military is the strongest in the world

03:12:58.540 --> 03:12:59.860
consistently for a while.

03:12:59.860 --> 03:13:01.980
No one weapon in the last 70 years

03:13:01.980 --> 03:13:04.300
has like made a big difference

03:13:04.300 --> 03:13:07.260
in terms of the overall prominence of the U.S. military.

03:13:07.260 --> 03:13:08.380
Right, because that's just saying,

03:13:08.380 --> 03:13:09.780
even though every once in a while,

03:13:09.780 --> 03:13:13.380
even the recent Soviet hyper missiles or whatever they are,

03:13:13.380 --> 03:13:17.020
they aren't changing the overall balance dramatically, right?

03:13:18.100 --> 03:13:21.580
So when we get to AI, now I can frame the question,

03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:22.820
how big is AI?

03:13:23.700 --> 03:13:26.700
Basically, if, so one way of thinking about AI

03:13:26.700 --> 03:13:28.860
is it's just all mental tasks.

03:13:28.860 --> 03:13:30.980
And then you ask what fraction of tasks are mental tasks?

03:13:30.980 --> 03:13:32.340
And then I go, a lot.

03:13:33.820 --> 03:13:37.300
And then if I think of AI as like half of everything,

03:13:38.260 --> 03:13:41.260
then I think, well, it's gotta be composed of lots of parts

03:13:41.260 --> 03:13:45.340
where any one innovation is only a small impact, right?

03:13:45.340 --> 03:13:48.820
Now, if you think, no, no, no, AI is like AGI.

03:13:49.700 --> 03:13:52.900
And then you think, AGI is a small thing, right?

03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:55.140
There's only a small number of key innovations

03:13:55.140 --> 03:13:56.700
that will enable it.

03:13:56.700 --> 03:14:00.820
Now you're thinking there could be a bigger chunk

03:14:00.820 --> 03:14:02.820
that you might find that would have a bigger impact.

03:14:02.820 --> 03:14:05.540
So the way I would ask you to frame these things

03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:09.900
in terms of the chunkiness of different areas of technology,

03:14:09.900 --> 03:14:11.260
in part, in terms of how big they are.

03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:14.540
So if you take 10 chunky areas and you add them together,

03:14:14.540 --> 03:14:16.180
the total is less chunky.

03:14:16.620 --> 03:14:19.900
But don't you, are you able until you solve

03:14:19.900 --> 03:14:22.700
the fundamental core parts of the problem

03:14:22.700 --> 03:14:25.460
to estimate the chunkiness of that problem?

03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:28.380
Well, if you have a history of prior chunkiness,

03:14:28.380 --> 03:14:30.620
that could be your best estimate for future chunkiness.

03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:31.700
So for example, I mean,

03:14:31.700 --> 03:14:34.100
even at the level of the world economy, right?

03:14:34.100 --> 03:14:37.500
We've had this, what, 10,000 years of civilization.

03:14:37.500 --> 03:14:39.140
Well, that's only a short time.

03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:42.140
You might say, oh, that doesn't predict future chunkiness.

03:14:43.100 --> 03:14:46.420
But it looks relatively steady and consistent.

03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:48.660
We can say even in computer science,

03:14:48.660 --> 03:14:50.820
we've had 70 years of computer science.

03:14:50.820 --> 03:14:52.540
We have enough data to look at chunkiness

03:14:52.540 --> 03:14:54.060
in computer science.

03:14:54.060 --> 03:14:57.420
Like when were there algorithms or approaches

03:14:57.420 --> 03:14:59.180
that made a big chunky difference

03:14:59.180 --> 03:15:03.780
and how large a fraction of those was that?

03:15:03.780 --> 03:15:05.820
And I'd say mostly in computer science,

03:15:05.820 --> 03:15:07.900
most innovation has been relatively small chunks.

03:15:07.900 --> 03:15:10.100
The bigger chunks have been rare.

03:15:10.100 --> 03:15:11.620
Well, this is the interesting thing.

03:15:11.620 --> 03:15:14.540
This is about AI and just algorithms in general

03:15:14.540 --> 03:15:17.780
is, you know, page rank.

03:15:17.780 --> 03:15:19.700
So Googles, right?

03:15:19.700 --> 03:15:23.620
So sometimes it's a simple algorithm

03:15:23.620 --> 03:15:27.500
that by itself is not that useful,

03:15:27.500 --> 03:15:28.340
but the scale-

03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:29.180
The context.

03:15:29.180 --> 03:15:32.100
And in a context that's scalable,

03:15:32.100 --> 03:15:34.300
depending on the context,

03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:36.500
is all of a sudden the power is revealed

03:15:36.500 --> 03:15:37.500
and there's something,

03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:39.780
I guess that's the nature of chunkiness

03:15:39.780 --> 03:15:44.780
is that things that can reach a lot of people simply

03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:46.580
can be quite chunky.

03:15:46.580 --> 03:15:49.780
So one standard story about algorithms is to say,

03:15:49.780 --> 03:15:54.420
algorithms have a fixed cost plus a marginal cost.

03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:57.260
And so in history, when you had computers that were very

03:15:57.260 --> 03:16:00.740
small, you tried all the algorithms that had low fixed costs

03:16:01.900 --> 03:16:03.460
and you look for the best of those.

03:16:03.460 --> 03:16:04.860
But over time, as computers got bigger,

03:16:04.860 --> 03:16:07.780
you could afford to do larger fixed costs and try those.

03:16:07.780 --> 03:16:10.620
And some of those had more effective algorithms

03:16:10.620 --> 03:16:12.580
in terms of their marginal cost.

03:16:12.580 --> 03:16:14.540
And that, in fact, you know,

03:16:14.540 --> 03:16:16.780
that it roughly explains the long-term history where,

03:16:16.780 --> 03:16:19.140
in fact, the rate of algorithmic improvement

03:16:19.140 --> 03:16:22.060
is about the same as the rate of hardware improvement,

03:16:22.060 --> 03:16:23.820
which is a remarkable coincidence.

03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:26.460
But it would be explained by saying,

03:16:26.460 --> 03:16:29.860
well, there's all these better algorithms you can't try

03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:31.220
until you have a big enough computer

03:16:31.220 --> 03:16:33.700
to pay the fixed cost of doing some trials

03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:36.060
to find out if that algorithm actually saves you

03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:37.380
on the marginal costs.

03:16:37.900 --> 03:16:39.620
And so that's an explanation

03:16:39.620 --> 03:16:41.740
for this relatively continuous history where,

03:16:41.740 --> 03:16:43.500
so we have a good story about why hardware

03:16:43.500 --> 03:16:44.620
is so continuous, right?

03:16:44.620 --> 03:16:47.580
And you might think, why would software be so continuous

03:16:47.580 --> 03:16:48.420
with the hardware?

03:16:48.420 --> 03:16:49.940
But if there's a distribution of algorithms

03:16:49.940 --> 03:16:51.820
in terms of their fixed costs,

03:16:51.820 --> 03:16:55.300
and let's say spread out a wide log-normal distribution,

03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:56.900
then we could be sort of marching

03:16:56.900 --> 03:16:58.540
through that log-normal distribution,

03:16:58.540 --> 03:17:00.860
trying out algorithms with larger fixed costs

03:17:00.860 --> 03:17:04.220
and finding the ones that have lower marginal costs.

03:17:04.260 --> 03:17:09.260
So would you say AGI, human level, AI,

03:17:10.740 --> 03:17:15.740
even EM, em, emulated minds is chunky?

03:17:18.620 --> 03:17:20.540
Like a few breakthroughs can take us.

03:17:20.540 --> 03:17:23.100
So an M is by its nature chunky

03:17:23.100 --> 03:17:25.540
in the sense that if you have an emulated brain

03:17:25.540 --> 03:17:28.780
and you're 25% effective at emulating it,

03:17:28.780 --> 03:17:30.780
that's crap, that's nothing.

03:17:30.780 --> 03:17:31.900
Okay. Okay.

03:17:31.900 --> 03:17:35.180
You pretty much need to emulate a full human brain.

03:17:35.180 --> 03:17:36.620
Is that obvious?

03:17:36.620 --> 03:17:37.460
Is that obvious?

03:17:37.460 --> 03:17:38.780
I think it's pretty obvious.

03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:40.860
I'm talking about like, you know,

03:17:40.860 --> 03:17:43.620
so the key thing is you're emulating various brain cells,

03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:45.700
and so you have to emulate the input-output pattern

03:17:45.700 --> 03:17:46.540
of those cells.

03:17:46.540 --> 03:17:49.060
So if you get that pattern somewhat close,

03:17:49.060 --> 03:17:51.420
but not close enough, then the whole system

03:17:51.420 --> 03:17:53.220
just doesn't have the overall behavior

03:17:53.220 --> 03:17:54.140
you're looking for, right?

03:17:54.140 --> 03:17:57.460
But it could have functionally some of the power

03:17:57.460 --> 03:17:58.300
of the overall system.

03:17:58.300 --> 03:17:59.140
So there'd be some threshold,

03:17:59.140 --> 03:18:00.900
the point is when you get close enough,

03:18:00.900 --> 03:18:02.540
then it goes over the threshold, right?

03:18:02.540 --> 03:18:04.100
It's like taking a computer chip

03:18:04.100 --> 03:18:07.260
and deleting every 1% of the gates, right?

03:18:07.260 --> 03:18:09.540
No, that's very chunky.

03:18:09.540 --> 03:18:12.900
But the hope is that the emulating the human brain,

03:18:12.900 --> 03:18:14.540
I mean, the human brain itself is not-

03:18:14.540 --> 03:18:16.700
Right, so it has a certain level of redundancy

03:18:16.700 --> 03:18:17.820
and a certain level of robustness.

03:18:17.820 --> 03:18:19.500
And so there's some threshold when you get close

03:18:19.500 --> 03:18:21.100
to that level of redundancy and robustness,

03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:21.980
then it starts to work,

03:18:21.980 --> 03:18:24.100
but until you get to that level,

03:18:24.100 --> 03:18:25.580
it's just gonna be crap, right?

03:18:25.580 --> 03:18:28.220
It's gonna be just a big thing that isn't working for us.

03:18:28.220 --> 03:18:31.220
So we can be pretty sure that emulations

03:18:31.220 --> 03:18:34.340
is a big chunk in an economic sense, right?

03:18:34.340 --> 03:18:36.060
At some point, you'll be able to make one

03:18:36.060 --> 03:18:39.940
that's actually effective in naval substituting for humans,

03:18:39.940 --> 03:18:43.060
and then that will be this huge economic product

03:18:43.060 --> 03:18:44.500
that people will try to buy like crazy.

03:18:44.500 --> 03:18:45.340
Now-

03:18:45.340 --> 03:18:46.260
You'll bring a lot of algae to people's lives,

03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:47.940
so they'll be willing to pay for it.

03:18:47.940 --> 03:18:51.180
Right, but it could be that the first emulation

03:18:51.180 --> 03:18:53.660
costs a billion dollars each, right?

03:18:53.660 --> 03:18:55.780
And then we have them, but we can't really use them,

03:18:55.780 --> 03:18:58.060
they're too expensive, then the cost slowly comes down

03:18:58.900 --> 03:19:02.460
and now we have less of a chunky adoption, right?

03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:04.340
That as the cost comes down,

03:19:04.340 --> 03:19:05.580
then we use more and more of them

03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:07.380
in more and more contexts,

03:19:07.380 --> 03:19:09.140
and that's a more continuous curve.

03:19:10.460 --> 03:19:13.620
So it's only if the first emulations are relatively cheap

03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:17.060
that you get a more sudden disruption to society,

03:19:17.940 --> 03:19:19.940
and that could happen if sort of the algorithm

03:19:19.940 --> 03:19:21.860
is the last thing you figure out how to do or something.

03:19:21.860 --> 03:19:24.380
What about robots that capture some magic

03:19:25.220 --> 03:19:27.540
in terms of social connection?

03:19:27.540 --> 03:19:29.860
The robots, like we have a robot dog

03:19:29.860 --> 03:19:31.180
on the carpet right there,

03:19:32.180 --> 03:19:35.140
robots that are able to capture some magic

03:19:35.140 --> 03:19:38.980
of human connection as they interact with humans

03:19:38.980 --> 03:19:41.140
but are not emulating the brain.

03:19:41.140 --> 03:19:42.780
What about those?

03:19:42.780 --> 03:19:43.860
How far away?

03:19:44.860 --> 03:19:47.820
So we're thinking about chunkiness or distance now.

03:19:47.820 --> 03:19:51.580
So if you ask how chunky is the task of making a,

03:19:51.580 --> 03:19:54.180
you know, emulatable robot or something,

03:19:55.020 --> 03:19:58.540
which chunkiness and time are correlated.

03:19:58.540 --> 03:20:01.300
Right, but it's about how far away it is

03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:03.540
or how suddenly it would happen.

03:20:03.540 --> 03:20:05.460
Chunkiness is how suddenly

03:20:05.460 --> 03:20:08.140
and difficulty is just how far away it is,

03:20:08.140 --> 03:20:09.940
but it could be a continuous difficulty.

03:20:09.940 --> 03:20:10.780
It would just be far away

03:20:10.780 --> 03:20:12.340
but we'll slowly, steadily get there,

03:20:12.340 --> 03:20:13.700
or there could be these thresholds

03:20:13.700 --> 03:20:14.700
where we reach a threshold

03:20:14.700 --> 03:20:16.140
and suddenly we can do a lot better.

03:20:16.140 --> 03:20:18.540
Yeah, that's a good, I mean, question for both.

03:20:18.540 --> 03:20:22.340
I tend to believe that all of it, not just the M,

03:20:23.180 --> 03:20:25.860
but AGI too is chunky

03:20:25.860 --> 03:20:30.860
and human level intelligence embodied in robots

03:20:31.100 --> 03:20:32.100
is also chunky.

03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:34.460
The history of computer science and chunkiness so far

03:20:34.460 --> 03:20:36.220
seems to be my rough best guess

03:20:36.220 --> 03:20:37.700
for the chunkiness of AGI.

03:20:37.700 --> 03:20:39.740
Yeah, it is chunky.

03:20:39.740 --> 03:20:42.420
Modestly chunky, not that chunky.

03:20:42.420 --> 03:20:44.060
Right.

03:20:44.060 --> 03:20:46.380
Our ability to use computers for too many things

03:20:46.380 --> 03:20:48.580
in the economy has been moving relatively steadily.

03:20:48.580 --> 03:20:51.500
Overall, in terms of our use of computers in society,

03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:55.740
they have been relatively steadily improving for 70 years.

03:20:55.740 --> 03:20:57.460
No, but I would say that's hard.

03:20:57.460 --> 03:20:58.860
Well, yeah, okay.

03:20:58.860 --> 03:21:00.580
Okay, I would have to really think about that

03:21:00.580 --> 03:21:03.900
because neural networks are quite surprising.

03:21:03.900 --> 03:21:04.980
Sure, but every once in a while

03:21:04.980 --> 03:21:06.260
we have a new thing that's surprising.

03:21:06.260 --> 03:21:07.900
But if you stand back,

03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:10.380
we see something like that every 10 years or so,

03:21:10.380 --> 03:21:13.660
some new innovations that has a big effect.

03:21:15.300 --> 03:21:16.860
So moderately chunky.

03:21:19.300 --> 03:21:20.140
Yeah.

03:21:20.140 --> 03:21:21.740
The history of the level of disruption we've seen

03:21:21.740 --> 03:21:23.300
in the past would be a rough estimate

03:21:23.300 --> 03:21:24.740
of the level of disruption in the future,

03:21:24.740 --> 03:21:27.580
unless the futures were gonna hit a chunky territory,

03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:29.500
much chunkier than we've seen in the past.

03:21:29.500 --> 03:21:34.500
Well, I do think it's like Kuhnian, like revolution type.

03:21:36.780 --> 03:21:40.300
It seems like the data, especially on AIs,

03:21:40.300 --> 03:21:45.300
is difficult to reason with because it's so recent.

03:21:46.740 --> 03:21:48.460
It's such a recent field.

03:21:48.460 --> 03:21:50.700
Well, AIs have been around for 50 years.

03:21:50.700 --> 03:21:53.780
I mean, 50, 60, 70, 80 years being recent.

03:21:56.260 --> 03:21:58.220
It's enough time to see a lot of trends.

03:21:59.140 --> 03:22:01.100
A few trends, a few trends.

03:22:01.100 --> 03:22:04.860
I think the internet, computing,

03:22:04.860 --> 03:22:07.060
there's really a lot of interesting stuff

03:22:07.060 --> 03:22:09.340
that's happened over the past 30 years

03:22:09.340 --> 03:22:13.900
that I think the possibility of revolutions

03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:16.900
is likelier than it was in the...

03:22:16.900 --> 03:22:18.060
I think for the last 70 years,

03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:19.620
there have always been a lot of things

03:22:19.620 --> 03:22:21.260
that looked like they had a potential for revolution.

03:22:21.260 --> 03:22:23.220
So we can't reason well about this.

03:22:23.220 --> 03:22:26.020
I mean, we can reason well by looking at the past trends.

03:22:26.020 --> 03:22:28.460
I would say the past trend is roughly your best guess

03:22:28.460 --> 03:22:30.140
for the future of this.

03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:32.540
No, but if I look back at the things

03:22:32.540 --> 03:22:33.860
that might have looked like revolutions

03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:35.660
in the 70s and 80s and 90s,

03:22:37.380 --> 03:22:40.420
they are less like the revolutions

03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:42.260
that appear to be happening now,

03:22:42.260 --> 03:22:45.540
or the capacity of revolution that appear to be there now.

03:22:45.540 --> 03:22:48.940
First of all, there's a lot more money to be made.

03:22:48.940 --> 03:22:50.860
So there's a lot more incentive for markets

03:22:50.860 --> 03:22:52.380
to do a lot of kind of innovation,

03:22:52.380 --> 03:22:54.740
it seems like in the AI space.

03:22:54.740 --> 03:22:57.220
But then again, there's a history of winters

03:22:57.220 --> 03:22:58.740
and summers and so on.

03:22:58.740 --> 03:23:01.100
So maybe we're just like riding a nice wave right now.

03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:03.260
One of the biggest issues is the difference

03:23:03.260 --> 03:23:06.540
between impressive demos and commercial value.

03:23:06.540 --> 03:23:08.340
So often through the history of AI,

03:23:08.340 --> 03:23:10.380
we saw very impressive demos

03:23:10.380 --> 03:23:12.980
that never really translated much into commercial value.

03:23:12.980 --> 03:23:15.020
Somebody who works on and cares about

03:23:15.020 --> 03:23:18.420
autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles, tell me about it.

03:23:19.180 --> 03:23:22.420
And there again, we return to the number of Elon Musk's

03:23:22.420 --> 03:23:25.820
per Earth per year generated.

03:23:27.060 --> 03:23:28.060
That's the M.

03:23:28.060 --> 03:23:30.460
Coincidentally, same initials as the M.

03:23:31.540 --> 03:23:33.260
Very suspicious, very suspicious.

03:23:33.260 --> 03:23:35.140
We're gonna have to look into that.

03:23:35.140 --> 03:23:37.980
All right, two more fields

03:23:37.980 --> 03:23:40.180
that I would like to force and twist your arm

03:23:40.180 --> 03:23:44.340
to look for viewquakes and for beautiful ideas, economics.

03:23:44.340 --> 03:23:49.340
What is a beautiful idea to you about economics?

03:23:51.500 --> 03:23:53.180
You've mentioned a lot of them.

03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:55.780
Sure, so as you said before,

03:23:55.780 --> 03:23:58.620
there's gonna be the first viewcake most people encounter

03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:01.060
that makes the biggest difference on average in the world

03:24:01.060 --> 03:24:03.380
because that's the only thing most people ever see

03:24:03.380 --> 03:24:05.060
is the first one.

03:24:05.060 --> 03:24:07.140
And so, you know, with AI,

03:24:07.140 --> 03:24:10.820
the first one is just how big the problem is.

03:24:10.820 --> 03:24:12.340
But once you get past that, you'll find others.

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:14.220
Certainly for economics,

03:24:14.220 --> 03:24:17.300
the first one is just the power of markets.

03:24:18.820 --> 03:24:20.820
You know, you might've thought it was just really hard

03:24:20.820 --> 03:24:24.220
to figure out how to optimize in a big complicated space

03:24:24.220 --> 03:24:27.660
and markets just do a good first pass

03:24:27.660 --> 03:24:29.020
for an awful lot of stuff.

03:24:29.020 --> 03:24:31.420
And they're really quite robust and powerful.

03:24:31.420 --> 03:24:35.100
And that's just quite the viewcrague

03:24:35.100 --> 03:24:37.620
where you just say, you know, just let up.

03:24:37.620 --> 03:24:39.180
If you wanna get in the ballpark,

03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:42.180
just let a market handle it and step back.

03:24:43.180 --> 03:24:44.740
And that's true for a wide range of things.

03:24:44.740 --> 03:24:45.580
It's not true for everything,

03:24:45.580 --> 03:24:48.780
but it's a very good first approximation.

03:24:48.780 --> 03:24:51.500
Most people's intuitions for how they should limit markets

03:24:51.500 --> 03:24:53.620
are actually messing them up.

03:24:53.620 --> 03:24:55.180
They're that good in a sense, right?

03:24:55.180 --> 03:24:56.020
Most people, when you go,

03:24:56.020 --> 03:24:57.660
I don't know if we wanna trust that,

03:24:57.660 --> 03:24:59.180
well, you should be trusting that.

03:24:59.180 --> 03:25:02.660
What about, what are markets?

03:25:02.660 --> 03:25:05.580
Like, just a couple of words.

03:25:06.940 --> 03:25:09.180
So the idea is if people want something,

03:25:09.180 --> 03:25:12.580
then let other companies form to try to supply that thing.

03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:14.620
Let those people pay for their cost

03:25:14.620 --> 03:25:15.580
of whatever they're making

03:25:15.580 --> 03:25:17.820
and try to offer that product to those people.

03:25:17.820 --> 03:25:21.300
Let many people, many such firms enter that industry

03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:23.340
and let the customers decide which ones they want.

03:25:23.340 --> 03:25:25.820
And if the firm goes out of business, let it go bankrupt

03:25:25.820 --> 03:25:28.100
and let other people invest in whichever ventures

03:25:28.100 --> 03:25:30.020
they wanna try to attract customers

03:25:30.020 --> 03:25:31.900
to their version of the product.

03:25:31.900 --> 03:25:33.260
And that just works for a wide range

03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:34.460
of products and services.

03:25:34.460 --> 03:25:35.380
And through all of this,

03:25:35.380 --> 03:25:37.820
there's a free exchange of information too.

03:25:37.860 --> 03:25:40.100
There's a hope that there's no manipulation

03:25:40.100 --> 03:25:41.420
of information and so on.

03:25:43.460 --> 03:25:45.540
Even when those things happen,

03:25:45.540 --> 03:25:48.180
still just the simple market solution is usually better

03:25:48.180 --> 03:25:49.900
than the things you'll try to do to fix it.

03:25:49.900 --> 03:25:50.940
The new alternative.

03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:53.940
That's a view crank.

03:25:53.940 --> 03:25:54.780
It's surprising.

03:25:54.780 --> 03:25:57.180
It's not what you would have initially thought.

03:25:57.180 --> 03:25:58.980
That's one of the great, I guess,

03:25:58.980 --> 03:26:01.660
inventions of human civilization

03:26:01.660 --> 03:26:03.340
that trust the markets.

03:26:04.300 --> 03:26:06.740
Now, another view cake that I learned in my research

03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:07.980
that's not all of economics,

03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:09.260
but something more specialized

03:26:09.260 --> 03:26:12.300
is the rationality of disagreement.

03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:14.780
That is basically people who are trying to believe

03:26:14.780 --> 03:26:17.580
what's true in a complicated situation

03:26:17.580 --> 03:26:19.020
would not actually disagree.

03:26:20.020 --> 03:26:22.300
And of course, humans disagree all the time.

03:26:22.300 --> 03:26:25.020
So it was quite striking fact for me to learn in grad school

03:26:25.020 --> 03:26:28.780
that actually rational agents would not knowingly disagree.

03:26:30.060 --> 03:26:32.220
And so that makes disagreement more puzzling

03:26:32.220 --> 03:26:35.180
and it makes you less willing to disagree.

03:26:37.620 --> 03:26:42.540
Humans are to some degree rational and are able to...

03:26:42.540 --> 03:26:44.580
Their priorities are different

03:26:44.580 --> 03:26:46.220
than just figuring out the truth.

03:26:48.940 --> 03:26:51.300
Which might not be the same as being irrational.

03:26:52.300 --> 03:26:54.740
That's another tangent that could take an hour.

03:26:56.580 --> 03:27:01.340
In the space of human affairs, political science,

03:27:01.340 --> 03:27:06.060
what is a beautiful, foundational, interesting idea to you,

03:27:06.060 --> 03:27:08.620
a view quake in the space of political science?

03:27:10.500 --> 03:27:13.700
The main thing that goes wrong in politics

03:27:13.700 --> 03:27:17.820
is people not agreeing on what the best thing to do is.

03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:20.780
That's a wrong thing.

03:27:20.780 --> 03:27:21.900
So that's what goes wrong.

03:27:21.900 --> 03:27:22.740
That is when you say,

03:27:22.740 --> 03:27:25.380
what's fundamentally behind most political failures?

03:27:25.380 --> 03:27:27.460
It's that people are ignorant

03:27:27.460 --> 03:27:30.660
of what the consequences of policy is.

03:27:30.660 --> 03:27:33.340
And that's surprising because it's actually feasible

03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:35.820
to solve that problem, which we aren't solving.

03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:37.900
So it's a bug, not a feature

03:27:37.900 --> 03:27:42.900
that there's an inability to arrive at a consensus.

03:27:43.900 --> 03:27:45.500
So most political systems,

03:27:45.500 --> 03:27:48.340
if everybody looked to some authority, say, on a question,

03:27:48.340 --> 03:27:50.060
and that authority told them the answer,

03:27:50.060 --> 03:27:51.740
then most political systems are capable

03:27:51.740 --> 03:27:52.900
of just doing that thing.

03:27:55.740 --> 03:27:57.140
That is.

03:27:57.140 --> 03:28:00.660
And so it's the failure to have trustworthy authorities

03:28:00.660 --> 03:28:03.420
that is sort of the underlying failure

03:28:03.420 --> 03:28:05.220
behind most political failure.

03:28:06.060 --> 03:28:07.140
We invade Iraq, say,

03:28:07.140 --> 03:28:09.100
when we don't have an authority to tell us

03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:10.900
that's a really stupid thing to do.

03:28:12.740 --> 03:28:14.860
And it is possible to create

03:28:15.780 --> 03:28:18.020
more informative, trustworthy authorities.

03:28:18.020 --> 03:28:22.100
That's a remarkable fact about the world of institutions,

03:28:22.100 --> 03:28:24.660
that we could do that, but we aren't.

03:28:24.660 --> 03:28:26.620
Yeah, so that's surprising.

03:28:26.620 --> 03:28:28.500
We could and we aren't.

03:28:28.500 --> 03:28:30.100
Another big view quake about politics

03:28:30.100 --> 03:28:31.300
is from the Elf in the Brain,

03:28:31.300 --> 03:28:33.340
that most people, when they're interacting with politics,

03:28:33.340 --> 03:28:35.940
they say they want to make the world better,

03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:37.660
they make their city better, their country better,

03:28:37.660 --> 03:28:39.340
and that's not their priority.

03:28:39.340 --> 03:28:40.380
What is it?

03:28:40.380 --> 03:28:42.740
They want to show loyalty to their allies.

03:28:42.740 --> 03:28:44.660
They want to show their people they're on their side.

03:28:44.660 --> 03:28:45.500
Yes.

03:28:45.500 --> 03:28:46.980
Other various tribes they're in,

03:28:46.980 --> 03:28:51.460
that's their primary priority, and they do accomplish that.

03:28:51.460 --> 03:28:54.220
Yeah, and the tribes are usually color-coded,

03:28:54.220 --> 03:28:55.500
conveniently enough.

03:28:57.660 --> 03:29:01.500
What would you say, it's the Churchill question,

03:29:01.540 --> 03:29:04.340
democracy is the crappiest form of government,

03:29:04.340 --> 03:29:05.780
but it's the best one we got.

03:29:06.660 --> 03:29:09.340
What's the best form of government for this,

03:29:09.340 --> 03:29:12.740
our seven billion human civilization,

03:29:12.740 --> 03:29:16.140
and maybe as we get farther and farther,

03:29:16.140 --> 03:29:18.140
you mentioned a lot of stuff that's fascinating

03:29:18.140 --> 03:29:21.740
about human history, as we become more forager-like,

03:29:21.740 --> 03:29:25.140
and looking out beyond, what's the best form of government

03:29:25.140 --> 03:29:26.660
in the next 50, 100 years,

03:29:26.660 --> 03:29:28.540
as we become a multiplicative species?

03:29:28.540 --> 03:29:33.540
So the key failing is that we have existing

03:29:33.740 --> 03:29:36.300
political institutions and related institutions,

03:29:36.300 --> 03:29:39.300
like media institutions and other authority institutions,

03:29:39.300 --> 03:29:42.580
and these institutions sit in a vast space

03:29:42.580 --> 03:29:44.260
of possible institutions.

03:29:44.260 --> 03:29:47.620
And the key failing, we're just not exploring that space.

03:29:47.620 --> 03:29:50.540
So I have made my proposals in that space,

03:29:50.540 --> 03:29:53.620
and I think I can identify many promising solutions,

03:29:53.620 --> 03:29:54.700
and many other people have made

03:29:54.700 --> 03:29:57.100
many other promising proposals in that space,

03:29:57.100 --> 03:29:58.980
but the key thing is we're just not pursuing

03:29:58.980 --> 03:30:00.700
those proposals, we're not trying them out

03:30:00.700 --> 03:30:02.140
on small scales, we're not doing tests,

03:30:02.140 --> 03:30:05.780
we're not exploring the space of these options.

03:30:05.780 --> 03:30:08.020
That is the key thing we're failing to do.

03:30:08.020 --> 03:30:11.500
And if we did that, I am confident we would find

03:30:11.500 --> 03:30:13.940
much better institutions than the one we're using now,

03:30:13.940 --> 03:30:15.940
but we would have to actually try.

03:30:17.420 --> 03:30:19.940
So a lot of those topics,

03:30:19.940 --> 03:30:21.860
I do hope we get a chance to talk again,

03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:23.660
you're a fascinating human being,

03:30:23.660 --> 03:30:26.500
so I'm skipping a lot of tangents on purpose

03:30:26.500 --> 03:30:28.060
that I would love to take.

03:30:28.060 --> 03:30:31.180
You're such a brilliant person on so many different topics.

03:30:31.180 --> 03:30:36.180
Let me take a stroll into the deep human psyche

03:30:39.820 --> 03:30:42.980
of Robin Hanson himself.

03:30:42.980 --> 03:30:43.820
So first-

03:30:43.820 --> 03:30:44.900
May not be that deep.

03:30:44.900 --> 03:30:49.900
I might just be all on the surface,

03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:50.820
what you see, what you get,

03:30:50.820 --> 03:30:52.420
there might not be much hiding behind it.

03:30:52.420 --> 03:30:54.900
Some of the fun is on the surface,

03:30:54.900 --> 03:30:55.740
and-

03:30:56.740 --> 03:30:59.780
I actually think this is true of many of the most successful,

03:30:59.780 --> 03:31:02.060
most interesting people you see in the world.

03:31:02.060 --> 03:31:05.620
That is, they have put so much effort into the surface

03:31:05.620 --> 03:31:07.620
that they've constructed,

03:31:07.620 --> 03:31:09.220
and that's where they put all their energy.

03:31:09.220 --> 03:31:12.340
Like, somebody might be a statesman,

03:31:12.340 --> 03:31:13.580
or an actor, or something else,

03:31:13.580 --> 03:31:14.580
and people wanna interview them,

03:31:14.580 --> 03:31:15.420
and they wanna say like,

03:31:15.420 --> 03:31:16.780
what are you behind the scenes?

03:31:16.780 --> 03:31:18.300
What do you do in your free time?

03:31:18.300 --> 03:31:19.500
Those people don't have free time,

03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.900
they don't have another life behind the scenes.

03:31:21.900 --> 03:31:24.660
They put all their energy into that surface,

03:31:25.620 --> 03:31:27.300
the one we're fascinated by,

03:31:27.300 --> 03:31:29.100
and they kind of have to make up the stuff

03:31:29.100 --> 03:31:31.300
behind the scenes to supply it for you,

03:31:31.300 --> 03:31:32.900
but it's not really there.

03:31:32.900 --> 03:31:34.420
Well, there's several ways of phrasing this.

03:31:34.420 --> 03:31:35.900
So one of it is authenticity,

03:31:35.900 --> 03:31:40.900
which is if you become the thing you are on the surface,

03:31:42.940 --> 03:31:45.420
if the depths mirror the surface,

03:31:45.420 --> 03:31:47.460
then that's what authenticity is.

03:31:47.460 --> 03:31:48.580
You're not hiding something,

03:31:48.580 --> 03:31:49.900
you're not concealing something.

03:31:49.900 --> 03:31:51.900
To push back on the idea of actors,

03:31:51.940 --> 03:31:55.860
they actually have often a manufactured surface

03:31:55.860 --> 03:31:58.900
that they put on and they try on different masks,

03:31:58.900 --> 03:32:01.780
and the depths are very different from the surface,

03:32:01.780 --> 03:32:02.860
and that's actually what makes them

03:32:02.860 --> 03:32:04.780
very not interesting to interview.

03:32:04.780 --> 03:32:09.780
If you're an actor who actually lives the role

03:32:10.500 --> 03:32:13.460
that you play, so like, I don't know,

03:32:13.460 --> 03:32:14.740
a Clint Eastwood type character

03:32:14.740 --> 03:32:17.740
who clearly represents the cowboy,

03:32:18.620 --> 03:32:22.540
like at least rhymes or echoes the person you play

03:32:22.540 --> 03:32:24.540
on the surface, that's authenticity.

03:32:24.540 --> 03:32:25.900
Some people are typecasts,

03:32:25.900 --> 03:32:27.580
and they have basically one persona.

03:32:27.580 --> 03:32:29.660
They play in all of their movies and TV shows,

03:32:29.660 --> 03:32:33.020
and so those people probably is the actual persona

03:32:33.020 --> 03:32:36.660
that they are, or it has become that over time.

03:32:36.660 --> 03:32:37.700
Clint Eastwood would be one,

03:32:37.700 --> 03:32:39.100
I think of Tom Hanks as another,

03:32:39.100 --> 03:32:40.980
I think they just always play the same person.

03:32:40.980 --> 03:32:44.060
And you and I are just both surface players.

03:32:44.620 --> 03:32:47.980
You're the fun, brilliant thinker,

03:32:47.980 --> 03:32:52.980
and I am the suit wearing idiot full of silly questions.

03:32:54.820 --> 03:32:59.820
All right, that said, let's put on your wise sage hat

03:33:02.580 --> 03:33:05.980
and ask you what advice would you give to young people today

03:33:05.980 --> 03:33:09.420
in high school and college about life,

03:33:09.420 --> 03:33:13.860
about how to live a successful life in career

03:33:13.860 --> 03:33:16.420
or just in general that they can be proud of?

03:33:18.380 --> 03:33:21.580
Most young people, when they actually ask you that question,

03:33:21.580 --> 03:33:22.780
what they usually mean is,

03:33:22.780 --> 03:33:26.620
how can I be successful by usual standards?

03:33:26.620 --> 03:33:28.540
I'm not very good at giving advice about that

03:33:28.540 --> 03:33:30.900
because that's not how I tried to live my life.

03:33:32.780 --> 03:33:35.980
So I would more flip it around and say,

03:33:35.980 --> 03:33:40.100
you live in a rich society, you will have a long life,

03:33:40.100 --> 03:33:42.380
you have many resources available to you.

03:33:43.260 --> 03:33:44.900
Whatever career you take,

03:33:44.900 --> 03:33:47.380
you'll have plenty of time to make progress

03:33:47.380 --> 03:33:49.420
on something else.

03:33:49.420 --> 03:33:51.340
Yes, it might be better if you find a way

03:33:51.340 --> 03:33:53.740
to combine your career and your interests

03:33:53.740 --> 03:33:55.300
in a way that gives you more time and energy,

03:33:55.300 --> 03:33:58.540
but there are often big compromises there as well.

03:33:58.540 --> 03:34:01.060
So if you have a passion about some topic

03:34:01.060 --> 03:34:03.900
or some thing that you think just is worth pursuing,

03:34:03.900 --> 03:34:04.980
you can just do it.

03:34:04.980 --> 03:34:06.980
You don't need other people's approval.

03:34:08.620 --> 03:34:12.020
And you can just start doing whatever it is you think

03:34:12.660 --> 03:34:13.500
is worth doing.

03:34:13.500 --> 03:34:14.340
It might take you decades,

03:34:14.340 --> 03:34:16.020
but decades are enough to make enormous progress

03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:18.500
on most all interesting things.

03:34:18.500 --> 03:34:20.540
And don't worry about the commitment of it.

03:34:20.540 --> 03:34:23.020
I mean, that's a lot of what people worry about is,

03:34:23.020 --> 03:34:24.540
well, there's so many options,

03:34:24.540 --> 03:34:26.660
and if I choose a thing and I stick with it,

03:34:26.660 --> 03:34:29.420
I sacrifice all the other paths I could have taken.

03:34:29.420 --> 03:34:32.380
But I mean, so I switched my career at the age of 34

03:34:32.380 --> 03:34:33.980
with two kids, age zero and two,

03:34:33.980 --> 03:34:35.860
went back to grad school in social science

03:34:35.860 --> 03:34:40.700
after being a research software engineer.

03:34:40.700 --> 03:34:43.900
So it's quite possible to change your mind later in life.

03:34:45.340 --> 03:34:47.020
How can you have an age of zero?

03:34:48.620 --> 03:34:49.460
Less than one.

03:34:51.060 --> 03:34:52.500
Okay.

03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:55.140
Oh, you index was zero, I got it, okay.

03:34:55.140 --> 03:34:57.780
Right, I mean, like people also ask what to read

03:34:57.780 --> 03:34:59.540
and I say textbooks.

03:34:59.540 --> 03:35:02.220
And until you've read lots of textbooks

03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:03.740
or maybe review articles,

03:35:03.740 --> 03:35:06.540
I'm not so sure you should be reading, you know,

03:35:06.540 --> 03:35:10.660
blog posts and Twitter feeds and even podcasts.

03:35:11.660 --> 03:35:13.860
I would say at the beginning, read the,

03:35:13.860 --> 03:35:16.020
this is our humanity's best summary

03:35:16.020 --> 03:35:18.300
of how to learn things is crammed into textbooks.

03:35:18.300 --> 03:35:22.660
Yeah, especially the ones on like introduction to biology.

03:35:22.660 --> 03:35:25.460
Introduction to everything, just read all the algorithms.

03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:27.660
Read as many textbooks as you can stomach

03:35:27.660 --> 03:35:29.620
and then maybe if you wanna know more about a subject,

03:35:29.620 --> 03:35:31.260
find review articles.

03:35:31.260 --> 03:35:33.620
You don't need to read the latest stuff for most topics.

03:35:33.620 --> 03:35:35.780
Yeah, and actually textbooks often have

03:35:35.780 --> 03:35:37.340
the prettiest pictures.

03:35:37.340 --> 03:35:38.180
There you go.

03:35:38.180 --> 03:35:40.140
And depending on the field, if it's technical,

03:35:40.140 --> 03:35:42.620
then doing the homework problems at the end,

03:35:42.620 --> 03:35:44.900
it's actually extremely, extremely useful.

03:35:44.900 --> 03:35:47.460
Extremely powerful way to understand something

03:35:47.460 --> 03:35:48.900
if you allow it.

03:35:48.900 --> 03:35:52.540
You know, I actually think of like high school and college,

03:35:52.540 --> 03:35:54.740
which you kind of remind me of.

03:35:54.740 --> 03:35:56.300
People don't often think of it that way,

03:35:56.300 --> 03:36:01.300
but you'll almost not again get an opportunity

03:36:02.180 --> 03:36:04.460
to spend the time with a fundamental subject.

03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.740
Right, lots of stuff, all the basics.

03:36:06.740 --> 03:36:08.140
And everybody's forcing you,

03:36:08.180 --> 03:36:10.420
like everybody wants you to do it.

03:36:11.340 --> 03:36:14.860
And like you'll never get that chance again to sit there,

03:36:14.860 --> 03:36:16.940
even though it's outside of your interest, biology.

03:36:16.940 --> 03:36:20.860
Like in high school, I took AP biology, AP chemistry.

03:36:23.060 --> 03:36:24.900
I'm thinking of subjects I never again

03:36:24.900 --> 03:36:26.540
really visited seriously.

03:36:26.540 --> 03:36:31.540
And it was so nice to be forced into anatomy and physiology,

03:36:32.260 --> 03:36:35.260
to be forced into that world, to stay with it,

03:36:35.260 --> 03:36:36.900
to look at the pretty pictures,

03:36:37.180 --> 03:36:39.740
to certain moments to actually for a moment,

03:36:39.740 --> 03:36:43.540
enjoy the beauty of these, of like how cell works

03:36:43.540 --> 03:36:44.660
and all those kinds of things.

03:36:44.660 --> 03:36:48.740
And somehow that stays, like the ripples of that fascination

03:36:48.740 --> 03:36:51.100
that stays with you, even if you never do those,

03:36:51.100 --> 03:36:56.020
even if you never utilize those learnings

03:36:56.020 --> 03:36:56.980
in your actual work.

03:36:56.980 --> 03:36:59.900
A common problem, at least of many young people I meet,

03:36:59.900 --> 03:37:03.340
is that they're like feeling idealistic and altruistic,

03:37:03.340 --> 03:37:04.700
but in a rush.

03:37:05.540 --> 03:37:09.620
So the usual human tradition that goes back

03:37:09.620 --> 03:37:10.820
hundreds of thousands of years

03:37:10.820 --> 03:37:13.620
is that people's productivity rises with time

03:37:13.620 --> 03:37:16.420
and maybe peaks around the age of 40 or 50.

03:37:16.420 --> 03:37:18.420
The age of 40, 50 is when you will be having

03:37:18.420 --> 03:37:21.060
the highest income, you'll have the most contacts,

03:37:21.060 --> 03:37:23.660
you will sort of be wise about how the world works.

03:37:25.780 --> 03:37:27.700
Expect to have your biggest impact then.

03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:30.180
Before then, you can have impacts,

03:37:30.180 --> 03:37:32.060
but you're also mainly building up

03:37:32.060 --> 03:37:33.580
your resources and abilities.

03:37:35.180 --> 03:37:37.620
That's the usual human trajectory.

03:37:37.620 --> 03:37:39.620
Expect that to be true of you too.

03:37:39.620 --> 03:37:41.580
Don't be in such a rush to like accomplish

03:37:41.580 --> 03:37:43.900
enormous things at the age of 18 or whatever.

03:37:43.900 --> 03:37:46.020
I mean, you might as well practice trying to do things,

03:37:46.020 --> 03:37:48.060
but that's mostly about learning

03:37:48.060 --> 03:37:49.260
how to do things by practicing.

03:37:49.260 --> 03:37:50.340
There's a lot of things you can't do

03:37:50.340 --> 03:37:51.940
unless you just keep trying them.

03:37:52.900 --> 03:37:55.540
And when all else fails, try to maximize

03:37:55.540 --> 03:37:58.500
the number of offspring however way you can.

03:37:58.500 --> 03:38:00.220
That's certainly something I've neglected.

03:38:00.220 --> 03:38:03.300
I would tell my younger version of myself,

03:38:03.340 --> 03:38:04.820
try to have more descendants.

03:38:06.700 --> 03:38:08.020
Yes, absolutely.

03:38:08.020 --> 03:38:10.420
It matters more than I realized at the time.

03:38:11.820 --> 03:38:16.820
Both in terms of making copies of yourself in mutated form

03:38:18.380 --> 03:38:21.180
and just the joy of raising them?

03:38:21.180 --> 03:38:22.020
Sure.

03:38:22.020 --> 03:38:25.420
I mean, the meaning even, you know.

03:38:25.420 --> 03:38:29.700
So in the literature on the value people get out of life,

03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:32.460
there's a key distinction between happiness and meaning.

03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:36.420
So happiness is how do you feel right now about right now

03:38:36.420 --> 03:38:39.020
and meaning is how do you feel about your whole life?

03:38:40.340 --> 03:38:43.340
And you know, many things that produce happiness

03:38:43.340 --> 03:38:44.900
don't produce meaning as reliably.

03:38:44.900 --> 03:38:45.980
And if you have to choose between them,

03:38:45.980 --> 03:38:48.100
you'd rather have meaning.

03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:52.380
And meaning is more goes along

03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:55.100
with sacrificing happiness sometimes.

03:38:55.100 --> 03:38:56.460
And children are an example of that.

03:38:56.460 --> 03:38:58.860
Do you get a lot more meaning out of children,

03:38:58.860 --> 03:39:01.100
even if there are a lot more work?

03:39:02.700 --> 03:39:07.540
Why do you think kids, children are so magical,

03:39:07.540 --> 03:39:08.980
like raising kids?

03:39:08.980 --> 03:39:12.140
Because I would love to have kids

03:39:12.140 --> 03:39:16.100
and whenever I work with robots,

03:39:16.100 --> 03:39:17.340
there's some of the same magic

03:39:17.340 --> 03:39:19.660
when there's an entity that comes to life.

03:39:19.660 --> 03:39:23.860
And in that case, I'm not trying to draw too many parallels,

03:39:23.860 --> 03:39:27.340
but there is some echo to it,

03:39:27.340 --> 03:39:29.620
which is when you program a robot,

03:39:29.620 --> 03:39:32.140
there's some aspect of your intellect

03:39:32.140 --> 03:39:35.420
that is now instilled in this other moving being

03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:37.300
that's kind of magical.

03:39:37.300 --> 03:39:39.260
Well, why do you think that's magical?

03:39:39.260 --> 03:39:41.020
And you said happiness and meaning

03:39:42.660 --> 03:39:43.980
as opposed to a short-

03:39:43.980 --> 03:39:44.820
Meaningful.

03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:46.300
Why is it meaningful?

03:39:47.380 --> 03:39:48.220
It's over determined.

03:39:48.220 --> 03:39:50.460
Like I can give you several different reasons,

03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:51.900
all of which is sufficient.

03:39:51.900 --> 03:39:52.900
And so the question is,

03:39:52.900 --> 03:39:54.820
we don't know which ones are the correct reasons.

03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:57.540
Such a technical, it's over determined.

03:39:57.540 --> 03:39:58.780
Look it up, please.

03:39:58.780 --> 03:40:01.460
So, you know, I meet a lot of people interested in the future,

03:40:01.460 --> 03:40:03.140
interested in thinking about the future.

03:40:03.140 --> 03:40:05.180
They're thinking about how can I influence the future?

03:40:05.180 --> 03:40:08.540
But, you know, overwhelmingly in history so far,

03:40:08.540 --> 03:40:10.380
the main way people have influenced the future

03:40:10.380 --> 03:40:13.740
is by having children, overwhelmingly.

03:40:13.740 --> 03:40:16.820
And that's just not an incidental fact.

03:40:16.820 --> 03:40:18.820
You are built for that.

03:40:18.820 --> 03:40:20.620
That is, you know, you're the sequence

03:40:20.620 --> 03:40:22.580
of thousands of generations,

03:40:22.580 --> 03:40:25.340
each of which successfully had a descendant.

03:40:25.340 --> 03:40:27.500
And that affected who you are.

03:40:27.500 --> 03:40:29.660
You just have to expect, and it's true,

03:40:29.660 --> 03:40:33.660
that who you are is built to be, you know,

03:40:33.660 --> 03:40:37.180
expect to have a child, to want to have a child,

03:40:37.180 --> 03:40:40.220
to have that be a natural and meaningful interaction for you.

03:40:40.220 --> 03:40:41.740
And it's just true.

03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:44.020
It's just one of those things you just should have expected.

03:40:44.020 --> 03:40:46.300
And it's not a surprise.

03:40:46.300 --> 03:40:49.100
Well, to push back and sort of,

03:40:49.100 --> 03:40:51.940
in terms of influencing the future,

03:40:51.940 --> 03:40:54.140
as we get more and more technology,

03:40:54.140 --> 03:40:56.740
more and more of us are able to influence the future

03:40:56.740 --> 03:40:58.180
in all kinds of other ways.

03:40:58.180 --> 03:40:59.020
Right.

03:40:59.020 --> 03:41:00.020
As a teacher, educator.

03:41:00.020 --> 03:41:02.620
Even so, though, still, most of our influence

03:41:02.620 --> 03:41:05.260
in the future has probably happened being kids,

03:41:05.260 --> 03:41:07.220
even though we've accumulated more ways,

03:41:07.220 --> 03:41:08.780
other ways to do it.

03:41:08.780 --> 03:41:09.900
You mean at scale.

03:41:09.900 --> 03:41:11.940
I guess the depth of influence,

03:41:11.940 --> 03:41:14.180
like really how much effort,

03:41:14.180 --> 03:41:16.500
how much of yourself you really put into another human being.

03:41:16.500 --> 03:41:20.340
Do you mean both the raising of a kid

03:41:20.340 --> 03:41:23.340
or you mean raw genetic information?

03:41:23.340 --> 03:41:25.260
Well, both, but raw genetics

03:41:25.260 --> 03:41:27.140
is probably more than half of it.

03:41:27.140 --> 03:41:28.260
More than half.

03:41:29.140 --> 03:41:29.980
More than half.

03:41:29.980 --> 03:41:33.940
Even in this modern world, genetics.

03:41:35.060 --> 03:41:39.500
Let me ask some dark, difficult questions, if I might.

03:41:39.500 --> 03:41:43.300
Let's take a stroll into that place

03:41:43.300 --> 03:41:46.900
that may or may not exist, according to you.

03:41:46.900 --> 03:41:48.940
What's the darkest place you've ever gone to

03:41:48.940 --> 03:41:50.940
in your mind, in your life?

03:41:50.940 --> 03:41:54.060
A dark time, a challenging time in your life

03:41:54.060 --> 03:41:55.420
that you have to overcome?

03:41:56.180 --> 03:42:01.180
Um, you know, probably just feeling strongly rejected.

03:42:03.700 --> 03:42:07.220
And so I've been, I'm apparently somewhat emotionally scarred

03:42:07.220 --> 03:42:09.660
by just being very rejection-averse,

03:42:09.660 --> 03:42:12.220
which must have happened because some rejections

03:42:12.220 --> 03:42:14.420
were just very scarring.

03:42:14.420 --> 03:42:17.780
At a scale, in what kinds of communities?

03:42:17.780 --> 03:42:19.820
On the individual scale?

03:42:19.820 --> 03:42:22.340
I mean, lots of different scales, yeah.

03:42:22.340 --> 03:42:24.500
All the different, many different scales.

03:42:24.540 --> 03:42:26.300
Still, that rejection stings.

03:42:27.220 --> 03:42:32.220
Hold on a second, but you're a contrarian thinker.

03:42:32.420 --> 03:42:36.220
You challenge that normals, why,

03:42:36.220 --> 03:42:41.220
if you were scarred by rejection, why welcome it

03:42:41.620 --> 03:42:44.260
in so many ways at a much larger scale,

03:42:44.260 --> 03:42:45.460
constantly with your ideas?

03:42:45.460 --> 03:42:47.620
It could be that I'm just stupid,

03:42:49.380 --> 03:42:51.780
or that I've just categorized them differently

03:42:51.780 --> 03:42:53.140
than I should or something.

03:42:54.140 --> 03:42:57.540
You know, the most rejection that I've faced

03:42:57.540 --> 03:42:59.900
hasn't been because of my intellectual ideas.

03:43:02.260 --> 03:43:06.180
So, the intellectual ideas haven't been the thing

03:43:06.180 --> 03:43:07.540
to risk the rejection.

03:43:07.540 --> 03:43:12.540
The one that, the things that challenge your mind,

03:43:13.420 --> 03:43:15.940
taking you to a dark place,

03:43:15.940 --> 03:43:18.940
the more psychological rejections, so.

03:43:18.940 --> 03:43:20.380
Well, you just asked me, you know,

03:43:20.380 --> 03:43:21.780
what took me to a dark place?

03:43:21.780 --> 03:43:23.500
You didn't specify it as sort of

03:43:23.500 --> 03:43:25.020
an intellectual dark place, I guess.

03:43:25.020 --> 03:43:27.260
Yeah, just meant like, what?

03:43:27.260 --> 03:43:29.180
So, intellectual is disjoint,

03:43:29.180 --> 03:43:32.700
or at least at a more surface level

03:43:32.700 --> 03:43:35.300
than something emotional.

03:43:35.300 --> 03:43:36.940
Yeah, I would just think, you know,

03:43:36.940 --> 03:43:38.700
there are times in your life when, you know,

03:43:38.700 --> 03:43:40.020
you're just in a dark place,

03:43:40.020 --> 03:43:41.860
and that can have many different causes,

03:43:41.860 --> 03:43:45.620
and most intellectuals are still just people,

03:43:45.620 --> 03:43:47.460
and most of the things that will affect them

03:43:47.460 --> 03:43:49.260
are the kinds of things that affect people.

03:43:49.260 --> 03:43:51.340
They aren't that different, necessarily.

03:43:51.500 --> 03:43:52.580
That's gonna be true for, like,

03:43:52.580 --> 03:43:54.980
I presume most basketball players are still just people,

03:43:54.980 --> 03:43:56.620
and if you ask them what was the worst part of their life,

03:43:56.620 --> 03:43:58.420
it's gonna be this kind of thing

03:43:58.420 --> 03:44:00.260
that was the worst part of life for most people.

03:44:00.260 --> 03:44:02.340
So, rejection early in life?

03:44:02.340 --> 03:44:05.820
Yeah, I think, I mean, not in grade school, probably,

03:44:05.820 --> 03:44:08.340
but, you know, yeah, sort of being a young nerdy guy

03:44:08.340 --> 03:44:13.340
and feeling, you know, not in much demand or interest,

03:44:13.860 --> 03:44:16.340
or, you know, later on,

03:44:17.260 --> 03:44:20.460
lots of different kinds of rejection, but yeah.

03:44:20.460 --> 03:44:22.820
But I think that's, you know,

03:44:22.820 --> 03:44:25.140
most of us like to pretend we don't that much

03:44:25.140 --> 03:44:27.060
need other people, we don't care what they think.

03:44:27.060 --> 03:44:28.620
I know it's a common sort of stance

03:44:28.620 --> 03:44:29.980
if somebody rejects you or something,

03:44:29.980 --> 03:44:32.260
I didn't care about them anyway, you know, I didn't,

03:44:32.260 --> 03:44:35.060
but I think, to be honest, people really do care.

03:44:35.060 --> 03:44:37.860
Yeah, we do seek that connection, that love.

03:44:37.860 --> 03:44:39.500
What do you think is the role of love

03:44:39.500 --> 03:44:40.820
in the human condition?

03:44:44.300 --> 03:44:45.940
Opacity, in part.

03:44:46.940 --> 03:44:51.220
That is, love is one of those things

03:44:51.220 --> 03:44:54.140
where we know at some level it's important to us,

03:44:54.140 --> 03:44:56.860
but it's not very clearly shown to us

03:44:56.860 --> 03:45:00.220
exactly how or why or in what ways.

03:45:00.220 --> 03:45:01.660
There are some kinds of things we want

03:45:01.660 --> 03:45:03.260
where we can just clearly see that we want

03:45:03.260 --> 03:45:04.220
and why that we want it, right?

03:45:04.220 --> 03:45:06.620
We know when we're thirsty and we know why we were thirsty

03:45:06.620 --> 03:45:08.420
and we know what to do about being thirsty,

03:45:08.420 --> 03:45:11.220
and we know when it's over that we're no longer thirsty.

03:45:12.460 --> 03:45:13.700
Love isn't like that.

03:45:14.700 --> 03:45:16.660
It's like, what do we seek from this?

03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:20.020
We're drawn to it, but we do not understand why

03:45:20.020 --> 03:45:23.700
we're drawn exactly, because it's not just affection,

03:45:23.700 --> 03:45:25.220
because if it was just affection,

03:45:25.220 --> 03:45:28.060
we don't seem to be drawn to pure affection.

03:45:28.060 --> 03:45:33.020
We don't seem to be drawn to somebody who's like a servant.

03:45:33.020 --> 03:45:35.220
We don't seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody

03:45:35.220 --> 03:45:38.300
that satisfies all your needs or something like that.

03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:41.580
So it's clearly something we want or need,

03:45:41.580 --> 03:45:43.660
but we're not exactly very clear about it,

03:45:44.620 --> 03:45:45.620
and that is kind of important to it.

03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:48.220
So I've also noticed there are some kinds of things

03:45:48.220 --> 03:45:49.820
you can't imagine very well.

03:45:49.820 --> 03:45:51.820
So if you imagine a situation,

03:45:51.820 --> 03:45:53.180
there's some aspects of the situation

03:45:53.180 --> 03:45:55.620
that you can clearly, you can imagine it being bright or dim,

03:45:55.620 --> 03:45:57.100
you can imagine it being windy,

03:45:57.100 --> 03:45:59.860
or you can imagine it being hot or cold,

03:45:59.860 --> 03:46:02.380
but there's some aspects about your emotional stance

03:46:02.380 --> 03:46:05.540
in a situation that's actually just hard to imagine

03:46:05.540 --> 03:46:06.380
or even remember.

03:46:06.380 --> 03:46:08.820
It's hard to like, you can often remember an emotion

03:46:08.820 --> 03:46:11.540
only when you're in a similar sort of emotion situation,

03:46:11.540 --> 03:46:14.620
and otherwise you just can't bring the emotion

03:46:14.620 --> 03:46:17.700
to your mind, and you can't even imagine it, right?

03:46:17.700 --> 03:46:20.340
So there's certain kinds of emotions you can have,

03:46:20.340 --> 03:46:21.380
and when you're in that emotion,

03:46:21.380 --> 03:46:22.460
you can know that you have it,

03:46:22.460 --> 03:46:23.980
and you can have a name and it's associated,

03:46:23.980 --> 03:46:26.940
but later on I tell you, you know, remember joy,

03:46:26.940 --> 03:46:28.980
and it doesn't come to mind.

03:46:28.980 --> 03:46:30.740
You're not able to replay it.

03:46:30.740 --> 03:46:33.180
Right, and it's sort of a reason why we have,

03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:35.540
one of the reasons that pushes us to reconsume it

03:46:35.540 --> 03:46:38.940
and reproduce it is that we can't reimagine it.

03:46:39.700 --> 03:46:41.340
Well, there's a, it's interesting,

03:46:41.340 --> 03:46:44.540
because there's a Daniel Kahneman type of thing

03:46:44.540 --> 03:46:45.780
of like reliving memories,

03:46:45.780 --> 03:46:49.660
because I'm able to summon some aspect of that emotion,

03:46:49.660 --> 03:46:51.820
again, by thinking of that situation

03:46:51.820 --> 03:46:54.220
from which that emotion came.

03:46:54.220 --> 03:46:58.140
So like a certain song, you can listen to it,

03:46:58.140 --> 03:47:00.500
and you can feel the same way you felt the first time

03:47:00.500 --> 03:47:02.340
you remembered that song associated with a certain.

03:47:02.340 --> 03:47:03.900
Right, but you need to remember that situation

03:47:03.900 --> 03:47:05.740
in some sort of complete package.

03:47:05.740 --> 03:47:06.580
Yes.

03:47:06.580 --> 03:47:07.780
You can't just take one part off of it,

03:47:07.780 --> 03:47:09.540
and then if you get the whole package again,

03:47:09.540 --> 03:47:11.100
if you remember the whole feeling.

03:47:11.100 --> 03:47:14.540
Yes, or some fundamental aspect of that whole experience

03:47:14.540 --> 03:47:17.180
that aroused, from which the feeling arose,

03:47:17.180 --> 03:47:20.500
and actually the feeling is probably different in some way.

03:47:20.500 --> 03:47:22.180
It could be more pleasant or less pleasant

03:47:22.180 --> 03:47:23.940
than the feeling you felt originally,

03:47:23.940 --> 03:47:27.340
and that morphs over time every time you replay that memory.

03:47:27.340 --> 03:47:28.180
It is interesting.

03:47:28.180 --> 03:47:31.580
You're not able to replay the feeling perfectly.

03:47:31.580 --> 03:47:32.700
You don't remember the feeling.

03:47:32.700 --> 03:47:34.500
You remember the facts of the events.

03:47:34.500 --> 03:47:36.100
So there's a sense of which over time

03:47:36.100 --> 03:47:39.340
we expand our vocabulary as a community of language,

03:47:39.340 --> 03:47:41.540
and that allows us to sort of have more feelings

03:47:41.540 --> 03:47:43.700
and know that we are feeling them.

03:47:43.700 --> 03:47:45.580
Because you can have a feeling, but not have a word for it,

03:47:45.580 --> 03:47:47.620
and then you don't know how to categorize it

03:47:47.620 --> 03:47:48.700
or even what it is,

03:47:48.700 --> 03:47:50.460
and whether it's the same as something else.

03:47:50.460 --> 03:47:52.260
But once you have a word for it,

03:47:52.260 --> 03:47:54.980
you can sort of pull it together more easily.

03:47:54.980 --> 03:47:56.020
And so I think over time,

03:47:56.020 --> 03:47:59.340
we are having a richer palette of feelings,

03:48:00.500 --> 03:48:03.060
because we have more words for them.

03:48:03.060 --> 03:48:05.620
What has been a painful loss in your life?

03:48:05.620 --> 03:48:09.780
Maybe somebody or something that's no longer in your life,

03:48:10.940 --> 03:48:12.660
but played an important part of your life.

03:48:12.660 --> 03:48:13.500
Youth?

03:48:14.860 --> 03:48:16.020
That's a concept.

03:48:16.020 --> 03:48:17.420
No, it has to be.

03:48:17.420 --> 03:48:18.660
But I was once younger.

03:48:18.660 --> 03:48:20.580
I had health, and I had vitality.

03:48:20.580 --> 03:48:21.420
I was handsome.

03:48:21.420 --> 03:48:23.020
I mean, you know, I've lost that over time.

03:48:23.020 --> 03:48:24.420
Do you see that as a different person?

03:48:24.420 --> 03:48:26.060
Maybe you've lost that person?

03:48:26.060 --> 03:48:27.700
Certainly, yes, absolutely.

03:48:27.700 --> 03:48:29.540
I'm a different person than I was when I was younger,

03:48:29.540 --> 03:48:33.380
and I'm not who, I don't even remember exactly what he was.

03:48:33.380 --> 03:48:35.860
So I don't remember as many things from the past

03:48:35.860 --> 03:48:38.940
as many people do, so I've just lost a lot of my history

03:48:38.940 --> 03:48:40.180
by not remembering it.

03:48:41.820 --> 03:48:42.900
And I'm not that person anymore.

03:48:42.900 --> 03:48:45.180
That person's gone, and I don't have any of their abilities.

03:48:45.180 --> 03:48:46.940
Is it a painful loss, though?

03:48:46.940 --> 03:48:47.780
Yeah.

03:48:47.780 --> 03:48:50.260
Or is it a, why is it painful?

03:48:50.260 --> 03:48:54.540
Because you're wiser, you're...

03:48:54.540 --> 03:48:57.100
I mean, there's so many things that are beneficial

03:48:57.100 --> 03:48:58.500
to getting older.

03:48:58.500 --> 03:49:02.740
Right, but I just was this person,

03:49:02.780 --> 03:49:06.540
and I felt assured that I could continue to be that person.

03:49:06.540 --> 03:49:07.820
And you're no longer that person.

03:49:07.820 --> 03:49:10.260
And he's gone, and I'm not him anymore,

03:49:10.260 --> 03:49:14.460
and he died without fanfare or a funeral.

03:49:14.460 --> 03:49:16.780
And that the person you are today talking to me,

03:49:16.780 --> 03:49:20.780
that person will be changed, too.

03:49:20.780 --> 03:49:24.460
Yes, and maybe in 20 years, he won't be there anymore.

03:49:24.460 --> 03:49:26.580
And a future person, you have,

03:49:28.580 --> 03:49:30.660
we'll look back, a future version of you will...

03:49:30.660 --> 03:49:32.660
For Ems, this will be less of a problem.

03:49:33.580 --> 03:49:35.180
For Ems, they would be able to save an archived copy

03:49:35.180 --> 03:49:37.260
of themselves at each different age,

03:49:37.260 --> 03:49:39.100
and they could turn it on periodically

03:49:39.100 --> 03:49:40.180
and go back and talk to it.

03:49:40.180 --> 03:49:41.100
So we play.

03:49:42.060 --> 03:49:44.500
You think some of that will be...

03:49:44.500 --> 03:49:47.420
So with emulated minds, with Ems,

03:49:48.980 --> 03:49:54.060
there's a digital cloning that happens.

03:49:54.060 --> 03:49:59.060
And do you think that makes you less special

03:49:59.740 --> 03:50:03.460
if you're clonable?

03:50:03.460 --> 03:50:08.460
Like, does that make you the experience of life,

03:50:10.260 --> 03:50:12.900
the experience of a moment, the scarcity of that moment,

03:50:12.900 --> 03:50:15.020
the scarcity of that experience,

03:50:15.020 --> 03:50:16.420
isn't that a fundamental part

03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:19.100
of what makes that experience so delicious,

03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:20.340
so rich a feeling?

03:50:20.340 --> 03:50:21.980
I think if you think of a song

03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:23.500
that lots of people listen to

03:50:23.500 --> 03:50:25.060
that are copies all over the world,

03:50:25.060 --> 03:50:27.140
we're gonna call that a more special song.

03:50:27.980 --> 03:50:28.820
Yeah.

03:50:29.700 --> 03:50:30.540
Yeah.

03:50:34.580 --> 03:50:37.660
So there's a perspective on copying and cloning

03:50:37.660 --> 03:50:42.020
where you're just scaling happiness versus degrading.

03:50:42.020 --> 03:50:44.700
I mean, each copy of a song is less special

03:50:44.700 --> 03:50:45.660
if there are many copies,

03:50:45.660 --> 03:50:47.540
but the song itself is more special

03:50:47.540 --> 03:50:48.620
if there are many copies.

03:50:48.620 --> 03:50:53.620
And on mass, right, you're actually spreading the happiness

03:50:53.620 --> 03:50:56.300
even if it diminishes over a large number of people

03:50:56.300 --> 03:50:58.540
at scale and that increases the overall happiness

03:50:58.540 --> 03:50:59.580
in the world.

03:50:59.580 --> 03:51:02.340
And then you're able to do that with multiple songs.

03:51:02.340 --> 03:51:05.620
Is a person who has an identical twin

03:51:05.620 --> 03:51:07.020
more or less special?

03:51:07.900 --> 03:51:12.780
Well, the problem with identical twins

03:51:12.780 --> 03:51:17.020
is, you know, it's like just two with M's.

03:51:17.020 --> 03:51:18.540
Right, but two is different than one.

03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:22.740
So I think an identical twin's life is richer

03:51:22.740 --> 03:51:24.420
for having this other identical twin,

03:51:24.420 --> 03:51:27.940
somebody who understands them better than anybody else can.

03:51:27.940 --> 03:51:30.060
From the point of view of an identical twin,

03:51:30.060 --> 03:51:31.500
I think they have a richer life

03:51:31.500 --> 03:51:33.740
for being part of this couple,

03:51:33.740 --> 03:51:34.740
each of which is very similar.

03:51:34.740 --> 03:51:36.940
Now, if you said, will the world,

03:51:36.940 --> 03:51:38.900
you know, if we lose one of the identical twins,

03:51:38.900 --> 03:51:40.340
will the world miss it as much

03:51:40.340 --> 03:51:42.380
because you've got the other one and they're pretty similar?

03:51:42.380 --> 03:51:44.060
Maybe from the rest of the world's point of view,

03:51:44.060 --> 03:51:46.460
they suffer less of a loss

03:51:46.460 --> 03:51:48.260
when they lose one of the identical twins.

03:51:48.260 --> 03:51:51.460
But from the point of view of the identical twin themselves,

03:51:51.460 --> 03:51:53.660
their life is enriched by having a twin.

03:51:53.700 --> 03:51:57.060
See, but the identical twin copying happens

03:51:57.060 --> 03:52:01.420
at the place of birth that's different than copying

03:52:01.420 --> 03:52:04.180
after you've done some of the environment,

03:52:04.180 --> 03:52:08.140
like the nurture at the teenage or in the 20s,

03:52:08.140 --> 03:52:08.980
after going to college.

03:52:08.980 --> 03:52:10.460
So that'll be an interesting thing for M's

03:52:10.460 --> 03:52:11.980
to find out all the different ways

03:52:11.980 --> 03:52:13.460
that they can have different relationships

03:52:13.460 --> 03:52:15.580
to different people who have different degrees

03:52:15.580 --> 03:52:17.780
of similarity to them in time.

03:52:17.780 --> 03:52:18.620
Yeah.

03:52:19.740 --> 03:52:21.580
Yeah, man.

03:52:24.140 --> 03:52:25.860
But it seems like a rich space to explore it.

03:52:25.860 --> 03:52:27.020
I don't feel sorry for them.

03:52:27.020 --> 03:52:29.340
This sounds like interesting world to live in.

03:52:29.340 --> 03:52:32.100
And there could be some ethical conundrums there.

03:52:32.100 --> 03:52:33.940
There will be many new choices to make

03:52:33.940 --> 03:52:35.300
that they don't make now.

03:52:35.300 --> 03:52:36.980
So, and we discussed it,

03:52:36.980 --> 03:52:38.620
and I discussed that in the book, Age of M,

03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:42.300
like say you have a lover and you make a copy of yourself,

03:52:42.300 --> 03:52:43.540
but the lover doesn't make a copy.

03:52:43.540 --> 03:52:45.940
Well now, which one of you,

03:52:45.940 --> 03:52:48.860
or are both still related to the lover?

03:52:48.860 --> 03:52:52.940
Socially entitled to show up.

03:52:53.700 --> 03:52:56.380
Yes, so you'll have to make choices then

03:52:56.380 --> 03:52:57.420
when you split yourself,

03:52:57.420 --> 03:53:00.260
which of you inherit which unique things.

03:53:01.860 --> 03:53:03.620
Yeah, and of course there'll be

03:53:05.460 --> 03:53:09.180
an equivalent increase in lawyers.

03:53:09.180 --> 03:53:10.740
I guess you can clone the lawyers

03:53:10.740 --> 03:53:14.780
to help manage some of these negotiations

03:53:14.780 --> 03:53:16.340
of how to split property.

03:53:16.340 --> 03:53:17.860
The nature of owning,

03:53:17.860 --> 03:53:22.260
I mean, property is connected to individuals, right?

03:53:22.260 --> 03:53:23.980
You only really need lawyers for this

03:53:23.980 --> 03:53:25.740
with an inefficient, awkward law

03:53:25.740 --> 03:53:28.340
that is not very transparent and able to do things.

03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:32.020
So, for example, an operating system of a computer

03:53:32.020 --> 03:53:33.780
is a law for that computer.

03:53:33.780 --> 03:53:35.580
When the operating system is simple and clean,

03:53:35.580 --> 03:53:37.460
you don't need to hire a lawyer

03:53:37.460 --> 03:53:39.020
to make a key choice with the operating system.

03:53:39.020 --> 03:53:40.380
You don't need a human in the loop.

03:53:40.380 --> 03:53:41.220
You just make a choice.

03:53:41.220 --> 03:53:42.660
You just walk by rules, yeah.

03:53:42.660 --> 03:53:44.780
Right, so ideally we want a legal system

03:53:44.780 --> 03:53:47.940
that makes the common choices easy

03:53:47.940 --> 03:53:49.580
and not require much overhead.

03:53:49.580 --> 03:53:52.540
And that's the digitization of things

03:53:52.540 --> 03:53:54.540
further and further enables that.

03:53:56.140 --> 03:53:59.100
So the loss of a younger self.

03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:01.500
What about the loss of your life overall?

03:54:01.500 --> 03:54:03.980
Do you ponder your death, your mortality?

03:54:03.980 --> 03:54:05.260
Are you afraid of it?

03:54:05.260 --> 03:54:07.180
I am a cryonics customer.

03:54:07.180 --> 03:54:09.740
That's what this little tag around my deck says.

03:54:09.740 --> 03:54:12.860
It says that if you find me in a medical situation,

03:54:12.860 --> 03:54:14.580
you should call these people

03:54:14.580 --> 03:54:17.020
to enable the cryonics transfer.

03:54:17.020 --> 03:54:20.380
So I am taking a long shot chance

03:54:20.380 --> 03:54:22.620
at living a much longer life.

03:54:22.620 --> 03:54:25.580
Can you explain what cryonics is?

03:54:25.580 --> 03:54:30.580
So when medical science gives up on me in this world,

03:54:30.580 --> 03:54:33.780
instead of burning me or letting worms eat me,

03:54:33.780 --> 03:54:37.100
they will freeze me or at least freeze my head.

03:54:37.100 --> 03:54:39.060
And there's damage that happens

03:54:39.060 --> 03:54:40.460
in the process of freezing the head,

03:54:40.460 --> 03:54:44.340
but once it's frozen, it won't change for a very long time.

03:54:44.380 --> 03:54:47.580
Chemically, it'll just be completely exactly the same.

03:54:47.580 --> 03:54:51.060
So future technology might be able to revive me.

03:54:51.060 --> 03:54:52.900
And in fact, I would be mainly counting

03:54:52.900 --> 03:54:54.900
on the brain emulation scenario,

03:54:54.900 --> 03:54:58.100
which doesn't require reviving my entire biological body.

03:54:58.100 --> 03:55:00.500
It means I would be in a computer simulation.

03:55:02.220 --> 03:55:06.580
And so that's, I think I've got at least a 5% shot at that.

03:55:06.580 --> 03:55:08.460
And that's immortality.

03:55:08.460 --> 03:55:10.020
Are you?

03:55:10.020 --> 03:55:12.140
So, but most likely it won't happen

03:55:12.180 --> 03:55:15.060
and therefore I'm sad that it won't happen.

03:55:15.060 --> 03:55:17.980
Do you think immortality is something

03:55:17.980 --> 03:55:19.380
that you would like to have?

03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:22.820
Well, I mean, just like infinity,

03:55:22.820 --> 03:55:25.620
I mean, you can't know until forever,

03:55:25.620 --> 03:55:26.940
which means never, right?

03:55:26.940 --> 03:55:29.740
So all you can really, the better choice is

03:55:29.740 --> 03:55:31.620
at each moment, do you wanna keep going?

03:55:31.620 --> 03:55:33.500
So I would like at every moment

03:55:33.500 --> 03:55:35.140
to have the option to keep going.

03:55:36.100 --> 03:55:40.060
The interesting thing about human experience

03:55:40.060 --> 03:55:45.060
is that the way you phrase it is exactly right.

03:55:45.540 --> 03:55:48.820
At every moment, I would like to keep going.

03:55:48.820 --> 03:55:50.500
But the thing that happens,

03:55:54.100 --> 03:55:59.100
leave them wanting more of whatever that phrase is.

03:55:59.340 --> 03:56:01.180
The thing that happens is over time,

03:56:02.300 --> 03:56:05.940
it's possible for certain experiences to become bland

03:56:05.940 --> 03:56:07.860
and you become tired of them.

03:56:07.860 --> 03:56:12.860
And that actually makes life really unpleasant,

03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:15.940
sorry, makes that experience really unpleasant.

03:56:15.940 --> 03:56:19.180
And perhaps you can generalize that to life itself

03:56:19.180 --> 03:56:21.460
if you have a long enough horizon.

03:56:21.460 --> 03:56:22.300
And so-

03:56:22.300 --> 03:56:24.780
Might happen, but might as well wait and find out.

03:56:24.780 --> 03:56:27.140
But then you are ending on suffering.

03:56:28.260 --> 03:56:31.980
So in the world of brain emulations, I have more options.

03:56:32.980 --> 03:56:34.740
You can return yourself to-

03:56:34.740 --> 03:56:36.940
I can make copies of myself,

03:56:36.940 --> 03:56:39.180
archive copies at various ages.

03:56:39.180 --> 03:56:40.940
And at a later age, I could decide

03:56:40.940 --> 03:56:42.540
that I'd rather replace myself

03:56:42.540 --> 03:56:44.780
with a new copy from a younger age.

03:56:44.780 --> 03:56:48.860
So does a brain emulation still operate in physical space?

03:56:48.860 --> 03:56:51.460
So can we do, what do you think about like the metaverse

03:56:51.460 --> 03:56:53.540
and operating in virtual reality?

03:56:53.540 --> 03:56:55.980
So we can conjure up, not just emulate,

03:56:55.980 --> 03:56:59.420
not just your own brain and body,

03:56:59.420 --> 03:57:01.460
but the entirety of the environment?

03:57:01.460 --> 03:57:03.660
Most brain emulations will in fact

03:57:03.660 --> 03:57:06.100
suppose most of their time in virtual reality.

03:57:06.100 --> 03:57:08.620
But they wouldn't think of it as virtual reality,

03:57:08.620 --> 03:57:11.300
they would just think of it as their usual reality.

03:57:11.300 --> 03:57:13.500
I mean, the thing to notice, I think in our world,

03:57:13.500 --> 03:57:16.460
most of us spend most time indoors.

03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:20.220
And indoors, we are surrounded by walls covered with paint

03:57:20.220 --> 03:57:23.540
and floors covered with tile or rugs.

03:57:23.540 --> 03:57:26.540
Most of our environment is artificial.

03:57:26.540 --> 03:57:28.660
It's constructed to be convenient for us.

03:57:28.660 --> 03:57:31.460
It's not the natural world that was there before.

03:57:31.460 --> 03:57:33.980
A virtual reality is basically just like that.

03:57:34.020 --> 03:57:35.940
It is the environment that's comfortable

03:57:35.940 --> 03:57:37.900
and convenient for you.

03:57:37.900 --> 03:57:41.500
But when it's that environment for you, it's real for you.

03:57:41.500 --> 03:57:43.380
Just like the room you're in right now

03:57:43.380 --> 03:57:45.180
most likely is very real for you.

03:57:45.180 --> 03:57:47.300
You're not focused on the fact that the paint

03:57:47.300 --> 03:57:50.060
is hiding the actual studs behind the wall

03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:52.980
and the actual wires and pipes and everything else.

03:57:52.980 --> 03:57:54.380
The fact that we're hiding that from you

03:57:54.380 --> 03:57:56.300
doesn't make it fake or unreal.

03:57:58.140 --> 03:58:02.260
What are the chances that we're actually

03:58:02.260 --> 03:58:04.540
in the very kind of system that you're describing

03:58:04.540 --> 03:58:07.420
where the environment and the brain is being emulated

03:58:07.420 --> 03:58:09.060
and you're just replaying an experience

03:58:09.060 --> 03:58:14.060
when you were first did a podcast with Lex after,

03:58:15.020 --> 03:58:17.980
and now the person that originally launched this

03:58:17.980 --> 03:58:19.900
already did hundreds of podcasts with Lex.

03:58:19.900 --> 03:58:22.780
This is just the first time and you like this time

03:58:22.780 --> 03:58:24.700
because there's so much uncertainty.

03:58:24.700 --> 03:58:27.140
There's nerves, it could have gone any direction.

03:58:28.380 --> 03:58:30.660
At the moment, we don't have the technical ability

03:58:30.660 --> 03:58:32.700
to create that emulation.

03:58:32.700 --> 03:58:35.580
So we'd have to be postulating that in the future

03:58:35.580 --> 03:58:38.380
we have that ability and then they choose to evaluate

03:58:38.380 --> 03:58:40.460
this moment now to simulate it.

03:58:40.460 --> 03:58:43.860
Don't you think we could be in the simulation

03:58:43.860 --> 03:58:45.460
of that exact experience right now

03:58:45.460 --> 03:58:47.100
and we wouldn't be able to know?

03:58:47.100 --> 03:58:51.180
So one scenario would be this never really happened.

03:58:51.180 --> 03:58:55.180
This only happens as a reconstruction later on.

03:58:55.180 --> 03:58:56.420
That's different than the scenario.

03:58:56.420 --> 03:58:57.820
This did happen the first time

03:58:57.820 --> 03:59:00.220
and now it's happening again as a reconstruction.

03:59:01.100 --> 03:59:03.900
That second scenario is harder to put together

03:59:03.900 --> 03:59:05.980
because it requires this coincidence

03:59:05.980 --> 03:59:07.580
where between the two times

03:59:07.580 --> 03:59:09.220
we produce the ability to do it.

03:59:10.300 --> 03:59:12.700
No, but don't you think replay of memories,

03:59:13.900 --> 03:59:18.060
poor replay of memories is something that-

03:59:18.060 --> 03:59:19.900
So that might be a possible thing in the future.

03:59:19.900 --> 03:59:22.220
You're saying it's harder than to conjure up things

03:59:22.220 --> 03:59:23.740
from scratch.

03:59:23.740 --> 03:59:25.140
It's certainly possible.

03:59:25.140 --> 03:59:26.820
So the main way I would think about it

03:59:26.820 --> 03:59:29.660
is in terms of the demand for simulation

03:59:29.660 --> 03:59:31.180
versus other kinds of things.

03:59:31.180 --> 03:59:32.740
So I've given this a lot of thought

03:59:32.740 --> 03:59:35.580
because I first wrote about this long ago

03:59:35.580 --> 03:59:37.420
when Bostrom first wrote his papers

03:59:37.420 --> 03:59:38.820
about simulation argument

03:59:38.820 --> 03:59:41.220
and I wrote about how to live in a simulation.

03:59:42.220 --> 03:59:47.220
And so the key issue is the fraction of creatures

03:59:47.980 --> 03:59:50.700
in the universe that are really experiencing

03:59:50.700 --> 03:59:52.540
what you appear to be really experiencing

03:59:52.540 --> 03:59:54.980
relative to the fraction that are experiencing it

03:59:54.980 --> 03:59:57.780
in a simulation way, i.e. simulated.

03:59:57.780 --> 04:00:02.780
So then the key parameter is at any one moment in time,

04:00:04.740 --> 04:00:06.140
creatures at that time,

04:00:06.140 --> 04:00:08.340
many of them, most of them are presumably

04:00:08.340 --> 04:00:09.980
really experiencing what they're experiencing,

04:00:09.980 --> 04:00:14.580
but some fraction of them are experiencing some past time

04:00:14.580 --> 04:00:17.260
where that past time is being remembered

04:00:17.260 --> 04:00:18.540
via their simulation.

04:00:19.620 --> 04:00:22.820
So to figure out this ratio,

04:00:22.820 --> 04:00:26.020
what we need to think about is basically two functions.

04:00:26.020 --> 04:00:30.380
One is how fast in time does the number of creatures grow

04:00:30.380 --> 04:00:32.100
and then how fast in time

04:00:32.100 --> 04:00:33.940
does the interest in the past decline?

04:00:34.860 --> 04:00:36.820
Because at any one time,

04:00:36.820 --> 04:00:39.620
people will be simulating different periods in the past

04:00:39.620 --> 04:00:40.940
with different emphasis based on-

04:00:40.940 --> 04:00:43.020
I love the way you think so much.

04:00:43.020 --> 04:00:44.260
That's exactly right, yeah.

04:00:44.260 --> 04:00:48.100
So if the first function grows slower

04:00:48.100 --> 04:00:50.420
than the second one declines,

04:00:50.420 --> 04:00:54.540
then in fact, your chances of being simulated are low.

04:00:55.500 --> 04:00:56.340
Yes.

04:00:56.340 --> 04:00:57.940
So the key question is how fast does interest

04:00:57.940 --> 04:01:00.420
in the past decline relative to the rate

04:01:00.420 --> 04:01:02.140
at which the population grows with time?

04:01:02.140 --> 04:01:03.060
Does this correlate to you?

04:01:03.060 --> 04:01:04.940
You earlier suggested that the interest

04:01:04.940 --> 04:01:07.500
in the future increases over time.

04:01:07.500 --> 04:01:08.740
Are those correlated?

04:01:08.740 --> 04:01:10.980
Interest in the future versus interest in the past?

04:01:10.980 --> 04:01:13.460
Like why are we interested in the past?

04:01:13.460 --> 04:01:15.180
But the simple way to do it, as you know,

04:01:15.180 --> 04:01:18.220
like Google Ngrams has a way to type in a word

04:01:18.220 --> 04:01:21.460
and see how interest in it declines or rises over time,

04:01:21.460 --> 04:01:22.300
right? Yeah, yeah.

04:01:22.300 --> 04:01:24.860
You can just type in a year and get the answer for that.

04:01:24.860 --> 04:01:29.180
If you type in a particular year like 1900 or 1950,

04:01:29.180 --> 04:01:32.740
you can see with Google Ngram how interest in that year

04:01:32.740 --> 04:01:36.180
increased up until that date and decreased after it.

04:01:36.180 --> 04:01:39.740
And you can see that interest in a date declines faster

04:01:39.740 --> 04:01:42.500
than does the population grow with time.

04:01:43.780 --> 04:01:45.500
That is brilliant.

04:01:45.500 --> 04:01:46.820
And so- That is so interesting.

04:01:46.820 --> 04:01:47.860
You have the answer.

04:01:48.900 --> 04:01:50.740
Wow.

04:01:50.740 --> 04:01:54.300
And that was your argument against, not against,

04:01:54.300 --> 04:01:56.260
to this particular aspect of the simulation,

04:01:56.260 --> 04:02:00.540
how much past simulation there will be,

04:02:00.540 --> 04:02:02.060
replay of past memories.

04:02:02.060 --> 04:02:04.140
First of all, if we assume that like simulation

04:02:04.140 --> 04:02:06.540
of the past is a small fraction of all the creatures

04:02:06.540 --> 04:02:07.980
at that moment, right?

04:02:08.980 --> 04:02:10.540
And then it's about how fast.

04:02:10.540 --> 04:02:12.460
Now, some people have argued plausibly

04:02:12.460 --> 04:02:15.660
that maybe most interest in the past falls

04:02:15.660 --> 04:02:16.540
with this fast function,

04:02:16.540 --> 04:02:18.980
but some unusual category of interest in the past

04:02:18.980 --> 04:02:20.340
won't fall that fast quickly.

04:02:20.940 --> 04:02:22.220
And then that eventually would dominate.

04:02:22.220 --> 04:02:24.300
So that's a other hypothesis.

04:02:24.300 --> 04:02:25.580
Some category.

04:02:25.580 --> 04:02:28.860
So that very outlier specific kind of, yeah, okay.

04:02:28.860 --> 04:02:29.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:02:29.700 --> 04:02:33.140
Like a really popular kinds of memories,

04:02:33.140 --> 04:02:35.220
but like probably-

04:02:35.220 --> 04:02:36.220
In a trillion years,

04:02:36.220 --> 04:02:38.580
there's some small research institute

04:02:38.580 --> 04:02:40.180
that tries to randomly select

04:02:40.180 --> 04:02:41.980
from all possible people in history or something.

04:02:41.980 --> 04:02:42.820
Yeah.

04:02:42.820 --> 04:02:43.660
To simulate.

04:02:43.660 --> 04:02:46.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:02:46.780 --> 04:02:48.820
So the question is how big is this research institute

04:02:48.940 --> 04:02:51.340
and how big is the future in a trillion years, right?

04:02:51.340 --> 04:02:52.860
And that would be hard to say.

04:02:52.860 --> 04:02:54.900
But if we just look at the ordinary process

04:02:54.900 --> 04:02:57.860
by which people simulate recent errors.

04:02:57.860 --> 04:02:58.700
So if you look at,

04:02:58.700 --> 04:03:00.940
I think it's also true for movies and plays

04:03:00.940 --> 04:03:02.140
and video games,

04:03:02.140 --> 04:03:04.940
overwhelming they're interested in the recent past.

04:03:04.940 --> 04:03:06.220
There's very few video games

04:03:06.220 --> 04:03:08.140
where you play someone in the Roman Empire.

04:03:08.140 --> 04:03:09.300
Right.

04:03:09.300 --> 04:03:10.860
Even fewer where you play someone

04:03:10.860 --> 04:03:12.620
in the ancient Egyptian Empire.

04:03:14.420 --> 04:03:15.580
Yeah, just in different-

04:03:15.580 --> 04:03:16.700
It's just declined very quickly.

04:03:16.700 --> 04:03:19.420
But every once in a while that's brought back.

04:03:21.020 --> 04:03:22.020
But yeah, you're right.

04:03:22.020 --> 04:03:25.180
I mean, just if you look at the mass of entertainment,

04:03:25.180 --> 04:03:26.540
movies and games,

04:03:26.540 --> 04:03:29.180
it's focusing on the present, recent, past.

04:03:29.180 --> 04:03:30.580
And maybe some, I mean,

04:03:30.580 --> 04:03:32.380
where does science fiction fit into this?

04:03:32.380 --> 04:03:35.300
Because it's sort of,

04:03:38.100 --> 04:03:39.140
what is science fiction?

04:03:39.140 --> 04:03:41.020
I mean, it's a mix of the past and the present

04:03:41.020 --> 04:03:43.100
and some kind of manipulation of that

04:03:43.100 --> 04:03:45.340
to make it more efficient for us

04:03:45.340 --> 04:03:49.020
to ask deep philosophical questions about humanity.

04:03:49.020 --> 04:03:51.580
The closest genre to science fiction is clearly fantasy.

04:03:51.580 --> 04:03:53.420
Fantasy and science fiction in many bookstores

04:03:53.420 --> 04:03:55.260
and even Netflix or whatever categories,

04:03:55.260 --> 04:03:56.780
they're just lumped together.

04:03:56.780 --> 04:03:58.940
So clearly they have a similar function.

04:03:58.940 --> 04:04:01.820
So the function of fantasy is more transparent

04:04:01.820 --> 04:04:02.900
than the function of science fiction.

04:04:02.900 --> 04:04:04.940
So use that as your guide.

04:04:04.940 --> 04:04:05.900
What's fantasy for?

04:04:05.900 --> 04:04:08.220
It's just to take away the constraints

04:04:08.220 --> 04:04:09.060
of the ordinary world

04:04:09.060 --> 04:04:11.260
and imagine stories with much fewer constraints.

04:04:11.260 --> 04:04:12.540
Right, that's what fantasy is.

04:04:12.540 --> 04:04:13.780
You're much less constrained.

04:04:13.780 --> 04:04:15.580
What's the purpose to remove constraints?

04:04:15.580 --> 04:04:18.300
Is it to escape from the harshness

04:04:18.300 --> 04:04:20.300
of the constraints of the real world?

04:04:20.300 --> 04:04:22.060
Or is it to just remove constraints

04:04:22.060 --> 04:04:24.500
in order to explore some,

04:04:24.500 --> 04:04:26.940
get a deeper understanding of our world?

04:04:26.940 --> 04:04:27.780
What is that?

04:04:27.780 --> 04:04:28.900
I mean, why do people read fantasy?

04:04:28.900 --> 04:04:33.900
I'm not a cheap fantasy reading kind of person.

04:04:34.500 --> 04:04:35.420
So I need to...

04:04:36.460 --> 04:04:38.180
One story that it sounds plausible to me

04:04:38.180 --> 04:04:40.860
is that there are sort of these deep story structures

04:04:40.860 --> 04:04:43.900
that we love and we want to realize,

04:04:43.900 --> 04:04:46.660
and then many details of the world get in their way.

04:04:46.660 --> 04:04:48.660
Fantasy takes all those obstacles out of the way

04:04:48.660 --> 04:04:51.300
and lets you tell the essential hero story

04:04:51.300 --> 04:04:52.340
or the essential love story,

04:04:52.340 --> 04:04:54.740
whatever essential story you wanna tell.

04:04:54.740 --> 04:04:57.140
The reality and constraints are not in the way.

04:04:58.900 --> 04:05:01.300
And so science fiction can be thought of as like fantasy,

04:05:01.300 --> 04:05:04.300
except you're not willing to admit that it can't be true.

04:05:04.300 --> 04:05:06.260
So the future gives the excuse of saying,

04:05:06.260 --> 04:05:07.340
well, it could happen.

04:05:08.340 --> 04:05:11.020
And you accept some more reality constraints

04:05:11.020 --> 04:05:12.940
for the illusion, at least,

04:05:12.940 --> 04:05:14.700
that maybe it could really happen.

04:05:16.420 --> 04:05:17.980
Maybe it could happen.

04:05:17.980 --> 04:05:19.940
And that, it stimulates the image.

04:05:19.940 --> 04:05:22.980
The imagination is something really interesting

04:05:22.980 --> 04:05:24.820
about human beings.

04:05:24.820 --> 04:05:26.980
And it seems also to be an important part

04:05:26.980 --> 04:05:28.500
of creating really special things

04:05:28.500 --> 04:05:30.940
is to be able to first imagine them.

04:05:30.940 --> 04:05:32.620
With you and Nick Bostrom,

04:05:32.620 --> 04:05:34.820
where do you land on the simulation?

04:05:34.860 --> 04:05:38.540
And all the mathematical ways of thinking it

04:05:38.540 --> 04:05:41.260
and just the thought experiment of it,

04:05:41.260 --> 04:05:42.940
are we living in a simulation?

04:05:44.420 --> 04:05:46.740
That was the just discussion we just had.

04:05:46.740 --> 04:05:49.260
That is, you should grant the possibility

04:05:49.260 --> 04:05:50.100
of being in a simulation.

04:05:50.100 --> 04:05:52.180
You shouldn't be 100% confident that you're not.

04:05:52.180 --> 04:05:54.300
You should certainly grant a small probability.

04:05:54.300 --> 04:05:56.300
The question is, how large is that probability?

04:05:56.300 --> 04:05:57.900
Oh, you're saying we would be,

04:05:59.100 --> 04:06:01.180
I misunderstood because I thought our discussion

04:06:01.180 --> 04:06:03.500
was about replaying things that already happened.

04:06:03.660 --> 04:06:06.140
But the whole question is, right now,

04:06:06.140 --> 04:06:08.180
is that what I am?

04:06:08.180 --> 04:06:11.940
Am I actually a replay from some distant future?

04:06:11.940 --> 04:06:13.780
But it doesn't necessarily need to be a replay.

04:06:13.780 --> 04:06:15.380
It could be a totally new.

04:06:15.380 --> 04:06:17.460
You could be, you don't have to be an NPC.

04:06:17.460 --> 04:06:19.180
But clearly, I'm in a certain era

04:06:19.180 --> 04:06:21.020
with a certain kind of world around me, right?

04:06:21.020 --> 04:06:22.580
So either this is a complete fantasy

04:06:22.580 --> 04:06:24.940
or it's a past of somebody else in the future.

04:06:26.580 --> 04:06:28.220
No, it could be a complete fantasy though.

04:06:28.220 --> 04:06:29.060
It could be, right?

04:06:29.060 --> 04:06:30.460
But then you might, then you have to talk about

04:06:30.460 --> 04:06:32.900
what's the fraction of complete fantasies, right?

04:06:33.820 --> 04:06:35.820
I would say it's easier to generate a fantasy

04:06:35.820 --> 04:06:37.900
than to replay a memory, right?

04:06:37.900 --> 04:06:39.940
Sure, but if we just look at the entire history,

04:06:39.940 --> 04:06:41.740
if we just look at the entire history of everything,

04:06:41.740 --> 04:06:43.860
we just say, sure, but most things are real.

04:06:43.860 --> 04:06:45.340
Most things aren't fantasies, right?

04:06:45.340 --> 04:06:47.500
Therefore, the chance that my thing is real, right?

04:06:47.500 --> 04:06:49.660
So the simulation argument works stronger

04:06:49.660 --> 04:06:50.580
about sort of the past.

04:06:50.580 --> 04:06:52.580
We say, ah, but there's more future people

04:06:52.580 --> 04:06:53.820
than there are today.

04:06:53.820 --> 04:06:56.060
So you being in the past or the future

04:06:56.060 --> 04:06:57.700
makes you special relative to them,

04:06:57.700 --> 04:07:00.220
which makes you more likely to be in a simulation, right?

04:07:00.220 --> 04:07:02.700
If we're just taking the full count and saying,

04:07:02.740 --> 04:07:05.140
in all creatures ever, what percentage are in simulations?

04:07:05.140 --> 04:07:07.620
Probably no more than 10%.

04:07:07.620 --> 04:07:10.020
So what's the good argument for that,

04:07:10.020 --> 04:07:11.700
that most things are real?

04:07:11.700 --> 04:07:12.540
Yeah.

04:07:12.540 --> 04:07:15.020
Because as Foster says the other way, right?

04:07:15.020 --> 04:07:18.380
In a competitive world, in a world where people

04:07:18.380 --> 04:07:20.980
have to work and have to get things done,

04:07:20.980 --> 04:07:24.780
then they have a limited budget for leisure.

04:07:24.780 --> 04:07:28.220
And so, you know, leisure things are less common

04:07:28.220 --> 04:07:31.060
than work things, like real things, right?

04:07:31.100 --> 04:07:32.900
That's just...

04:07:32.900 --> 04:07:37.540
But if you look at the stretch of history in the universe,

04:07:37.540 --> 04:07:41.980
doesn't the ratio of leisure increase?

04:07:43.700 --> 04:07:44.660
Isn't that where we...

04:07:44.660 --> 04:07:45.500
Isn't that the forger?

04:07:45.500 --> 04:07:47.500
Right, but now we're looking at the fraction of leisure,

04:07:47.500 --> 04:07:49.140
which takes the form of something

04:07:49.140 --> 04:07:52.140
where the person doing the leisure doesn't realize it.

04:07:52.140 --> 04:07:53.340
Now there could be some fraction of that,

04:07:53.340 --> 04:07:55.260
but that's much smaller, right?

04:07:55.260 --> 04:07:56.100
Yeah.

04:07:57.580 --> 04:07:59.020
Clueless forgers.

04:07:59.060 --> 04:08:00.900
Or somebody is clueless in the process

04:08:00.900 --> 04:08:02.820
of supporting this leisure, right?

04:08:02.820 --> 04:08:04.460
It might not be the person leisureing,

04:08:04.460 --> 04:08:05.780
they're a supporting character or something,

04:08:05.780 --> 04:08:09.060
but still that's gotta be a pretty small fraction of leisure.

04:08:09.060 --> 04:08:09.900
What...

04:08:09.900 --> 04:08:11.940
You mentioned that children are one of the things

04:08:11.940 --> 04:08:13.860
that are a source of meaning.

04:08:13.860 --> 04:08:16.460
Broadly speaking, then let me ask the big question.

04:08:16.460 --> 04:08:18.420
What's the meaning of this whole thing?

04:08:19.420 --> 04:08:21.300
Robin, meaning of life.

04:08:21.300 --> 04:08:23.260
What is the meaning of life?

04:08:23.260 --> 04:08:26.300
We talked about alien civilizations,

04:08:26.300 --> 04:08:27.700
but this is the one we got.

04:08:27.700 --> 04:08:28.940
Where are the aliens?

04:08:29.860 --> 04:08:30.980
Where are the human?

04:08:30.980 --> 04:08:35.220
Seem to be conscious, be able to introspect.

04:08:35.220 --> 04:08:37.420
What's, why are we here?

04:08:37.420 --> 04:08:39.260
This is the thing I told you before

04:08:39.260 --> 04:08:40.820
about how we can predict

04:08:40.820 --> 04:08:43.900
that future creatures will be different from us.

04:08:43.900 --> 04:08:47.420
We, our preferences are this amalgam

04:08:47.420 --> 04:08:51.300
of various sorts of random sort of patched together

04:08:51.300 --> 04:08:56.060
preferences about thirst and sex and sleep and attention

04:08:56.060 --> 04:08:57.460
and all these sorts of things.

04:08:57.460 --> 04:08:59.780
So we don't understand that very well.

04:08:59.780 --> 04:09:03.300
It's not very transparent and it's a mess, right?

04:09:03.300 --> 04:09:06.620
That is the source of our motivation.

04:09:06.620 --> 04:09:10.260
That is how we were made and how we are induced to do things.

04:09:10.260 --> 04:09:12.420
But we can't summarize it very well

04:09:12.420 --> 04:09:14.460
and we don't even understand it very well.

04:09:14.460 --> 04:09:15.740
That's who we are.

04:09:15.740 --> 04:09:17.460
And often we find ourselves in a situation

04:09:17.460 --> 04:09:18.780
where we don't feel very motivated.

04:09:18.780 --> 04:09:19.620
We don't know why.

04:09:19.620 --> 04:09:21.740
In other situations, we find ourselves very motivated

04:09:21.740 --> 04:09:23.180
and we don't know why either.

04:09:24.180 --> 04:09:26.820
And so that's the nature of being a human

04:09:26.820 --> 04:09:28.020
of the sort that we are,

04:09:28.020 --> 04:09:30.460
because even though we can think abstractly

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:32.860
and reason abstractly, this package of motivations

04:09:32.860 --> 04:09:34.820
is just opaque and a mess.

04:09:34.820 --> 04:09:37.540
And that's what it means to be a human today

04:09:37.540 --> 04:09:38.380
and the motivation.

04:09:38.380 --> 04:09:41.260
We can't very well tell the meaning of our life.

04:09:41.260 --> 04:09:43.940
It is this mess that our descendants will be different.

04:09:43.940 --> 04:09:47.220
They will actually know exactly what they want

04:09:47.220 --> 04:09:49.820
and it will be to have more descendants.

04:09:49.820 --> 04:09:51.740
That will be the meaning for them.

04:09:52.740 --> 04:09:54.660
Well, it's funny that you have the certainty.

04:09:54.660 --> 04:09:56.340
You have more certainty.

04:09:56.340 --> 04:09:59.860
You have more transparency about our descendants

04:09:59.860 --> 04:10:01.940
than you do about your own self.

04:10:01.940 --> 04:10:02.780
Right.

04:10:04.780 --> 04:10:05.980
It's really interesting to think,

04:10:05.980 --> 04:10:08.020
because you mentioned this about love,

04:10:08.020 --> 04:10:12.220
that something that's fundamental about love

04:10:12.220 --> 04:10:13.140
is this opaqueness,

04:10:13.140 --> 04:10:15.020
that we're not able to really introspect

04:10:15.020 --> 04:10:18.620
what the heck it is or all the feelings,

04:10:18.620 --> 04:10:19.460
the complex feelings of all of them.

04:10:19.460 --> 04:10:21.500
And that's true about many of our motivations.

04:10:22.300 --> 04:10:23.860
And that's what it means to be human

04:10:23.860 --> 04:10:28.860
of the 20th and the 21st century variety.

04:10:29.740 --> 04:10:33.660
Why is that not a feature that we want,

04:10:33.660 --> 04:10:37.060
we'll choose to persist in civilization then?

04:10:37.060 --> 04:10:40.380
This opaqueness, put another way, mystery,

04:10:40.380 --> 04:10:42.420
maintaining a sense of mystery about ourselves

04:10:42.420 --> 04:10:44.500
and about those around us.

04:10:44.500 --> 04:10:46.380
Maybe that's a really nice thing to have.

04:10:46.380 --> 04:10:50.140
Maybe, but, so, I mean, this is the fundamental issue

04:10:50.180 --> 04:10:53.780
in analyzing the future, what will set the future?

04:10:53.780 --> 04:10:56.460
One theory about what will set the future is

04:10:56.460 --> 04:10:58.580
what do we want the future to be?

04:10:58.580 --> 04:10:59.420
So under that theory,

04:10:59.420 --> 04:11:01.500
we should sit and talk about what we want the future to be,

04:11:01.500 --> 04:11:04.100
have some conferences, have some conventions,

04:11:04.100 --> 04:11:06.020
discussion things, vote on it maybe,

04:11:06.020 --> 04:11:08.180
and then hand it off to the implementation people

04:11:08.180 --> 04:11:10.980
to make the future the way we've decided it should be.

04:11:12.380 --> 04:11:15.060
That's not the actual process that's changed the world

04:11:15.060 --> 04:11:16.780
over history up to this point.

04:11:16.780 --> 04:11:19.780
It has not been the result of us deciding what we want

04:11:19.780 --> 04:11:21.420
and making it happen.

04:11:21.420 --> 04:11:23.380
In our individual lives, we can do that,

04:11:23.380 --> 04:11:24.900
and we might decide what career we want

04:11:24.900 --> 04:11:26.900
or where we wanna live, who we wanna live with.

04:11:26.900 --> 04:11:30.220
In our individual lives, we often do slowly make our lives

04:11:30.220 --> 04:11:32.060
better according to our plan and our things,

04:11:32.060 --> 04:11:33.620
but that's not the whole world.

04:11:34.540 --> 04:11:37.300
The whole world so far has mostly been a competitive world

04:11:37.300 --> 04:11:40.300
where things happen if anybody anywhere chooses

04:11:40.300 --> 04:11:42.300
to adopt them and they have an advantage,

04:11:42.300 --> 04:11:43.900
and then it spreads and other people are forced

04:11:43.900 --> 04:11:46.340
to adopt it by competitive pressures.

04:11:46.340 --> 04:11:48.340
So that's the kind of analysis I can use

04:11:48.340 --> 04:11:50.900
to predict the future, and I do use that to predict future.

04:11:50.900 --> 04:11:52.620
It doesn't tell us it'll be a future we like.

04:11:52.620 --> 04:11:54.820
It just tells us what it'll be.

04:11:54.820 --> 04:11:56.740
And it'll be one where we're trying to maximize

04:11:56.740 --> 04:11:57.940
the number of our descendants.

04:11:57.940 --> 04:12:00.620
And we know that abstractly and directly,

04:12:00.620 --> 04:12:01.700
and it's not opaque.

04:12:01.700 --> 04:12:04.380
With some probability that's non-zero,

04:12:04.380 --> 04:12:06.420
that will lead us to become grabby

04:12:07.380 --> 04:12:12.060
in expanding aggressively out into the cosmos

04:12:12.060 --> 04:12:13.780
until we meet other aliens.

04:12:13.780 --> 04:12:14.820
The timing isn't clear.

04:12:14.820 --> 04:12:17.140
We might become glabby, and then this happens.

04:12:17.140 --> 04:12:19.500
These are, grabbiness and this are both

04:12:19.500 --> 04:12:20.740
the results of competition,

04:12:20.740 --> 04:12:22.740
but it's less clear which happens first.

04:12:24.380 --> 04:12:26.660
Does this future excite you or scare you?

04:12:26.660 --> 04:12:28.220
How do you feel about this whole thing?

04:12:28.220 --> 04:12:31.100
Again, I told you compared to sort of a dead cosmology,

04:12:31.100 --> 04:12:34.140
at least it's energizing and having a living story

04:12:34.140 --> 04:12:36.860
with real actors and characters and agendas, right?

04:12:36.860 --> 04:12:40.900
Yeah, and that's one hell of a fun universe to live in.

04:12:40.900 --> 04:12:43.820
Robin, you're one of the most fascinating, fun people

04:12:43.820 --> 04:12:48.820
to talk to, brilliant, humble, systematic in your analysis.

04:12:48.900 --> 04:12:49.980
Hold on to my wallet here.

04:12:49.980 --> 04:12:50.860
What's he looking for?

04:12:50.860 --> 04:12:53.060
I already stole your wallet long ago.

04:12:53.060 --> 04:12:54.300
I really, really appreciate you

04:12:54.300 --> 04:12:55.540
spending your valuable time with me.

04:12:55.540 --> 04:12:57.140
I hope we get a chance to talk

04:12:58.140 --> 04:12:59.620
many more times in the future.
