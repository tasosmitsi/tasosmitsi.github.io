00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
The following is a conversation with Elon Musk,

00:02.560 --> 00:06.160
his third time on this, the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.480
Yeah, make yourself comfortable.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.320
Boo.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.160
No, wow, okay.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.000
No.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.760
You don't do the headphones thing?

00:12.760 --> 00:13.600
No.

00:13.600 --> 00:14.420
Okay.

00:14.420 --> 00:15.800
I mean, how close do I get need to get the same thing?

00:15.800 --> 00:17.560
The closer you are, the sexier you sound.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.400
Hey, babe.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.220
What's up?

00:19.220 --> 00:20.880
Can't get enough of what you're all about, baby.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.680
I'm gonna clip that out

00:24.680 --> 00:26.720
and anytime somebody messages me about it,

00:26.720 --> 00:27.560
I don't just respond.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.120
And you think I'm sexy.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.080
Come right out and tell me so.

00:38.840 --> 00:39.680
So good.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.880
Okay, serious mode activate.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.320
All right.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.360
Serious mode.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.180
Come on, you're Russian.

00:45.180 --> 00:46.020
You can be serious.

00:46.020 --> 00:46.840
Yeah, I know.

00:46.840 --> 00:47.680
Everyone's serious all the time in Russia.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.600
Yeah.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.040
Yeah, that's right.

00:50.040 --> 00:50.880
We'll get there.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.280
We'll get there.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.120
Yeah.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.940
It's gotten soft.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.740
Allow me to say that the SpaceX launch

00:57.740 --> 01:00.940
of human beings to orbit on May 30th, 2020

01:02.140 --> 01:03.900
was seen by many as the first step

01:03.900 --> 01:07.420
in a new era of human space exploration.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.620
These human space flight missions were a beacon of hope

01:10.620 --> 01:12.740
to me and to millions over the past two years

01:12.740 --> 01:14.660
as our world has been going through

01:14.660 --> 01:18.060
one of the most difficult periods in recent human history.

01:18.060 --> 01:21.740
We saw, we see the rise of division, fear, cynicism,

01:21.740 --> 01:24.620
and the loss of common humanity

01:24.620 --> 01:26.380
right when it is needed most.

01:26.380 --> 01:29.080
So first, Elon, let me say thank you

01:29.080 --> 01:30.620
for giving the world hope and reason

01:30.620 --> 01:32.540
to be excited about the future.

01:32.540 --> 01:34.200
Oh, it's kind of you to say.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.500
I do want to do that.

01:35.500 --> 01:38.300
Humanity has obviously a lot of issues

01:38.300 --> 01:42.620
and people at times do bad things,

01:42.620 --> 01:47.260
but despite all that, I love humanity

01:47.260 --> 01:52.260
and I think we should make sure we do everything

01:52.260 --> 01:54.660
we can to have a good future and an exciting future

01:54.660 --> 01:58.340
and one where that maximizes the happiness of the people.

01:58.340 --> 02:00.940
Let me ask about Crew Dragon Demo 2.

02:00.940 --> 02:04.380
So that first flight with humans on board,

02:04.380 --> 02:06.180
how did you feel leading up to that launch?

02:06.180 --> 02:07.260
Were you scared?

02:07.260 --> 02:08.260
Were you excited?

02:08.260 --> 02:09.660
What was going through your mind?

02:09.660 --> 02:11.380
So much was at stake.

02:12.380 --> 02:16.060
Yeah, no, that was extremely stressful, no question.

02:16.060 --> 02:20.260
We obviously could not let them down in any way.

02:20.260 --> 02:25.260
So extremely stressful, I'd say, to say the least.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.460
I was confident that at the time that we launched,

02:29.460 --> 02:34.460
that no one could think of anything at all to do

02:35.380 --> 02:37.380
that would improve the probability of success.

02:37.380 --> 02:40.180
And we racked our brains to think of any possible way

02:40.180 --> 02:41.580
to improve the probability of success.

02:41.580 --> 02:44.980
We could not think of anything more and nor could NASA.

02:44.980 --> 02:48.380
And so that's just the best that we could do.

02:48.380 --> 02:52.380
So then we went ahead and launched.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.980
Now, I'm not a religious person,

02:54.980 --> 02:57.580
but I nonetheless got on my knees

02:57.580 --> 02:59.380
and prayed for that mission.

03:00.380 --> 03:01.780
Were you able to sleep?

03:02.580 --> 03:03.380
No.

03:03.380 --> 03:06.380
How did it feel when it was a success?

03:06.380 --> 03:08.380
First, when the launch was a success

03:08.380 --> 03:11.380
and when they returned back home or back to Earth?

03:12.380 --> 03:16.380
It was a great relief, yeah.

03:17.380 --> 03:18.980
For high stress situations,

03:18.980 --> 03:21.380
I find it's not so much elation as relief.

03:24.380 --> 03:29.380
And I think once, as we got more comfortable with it,

03:30.380 --> 03:34.580
as we got more comfortable and proved out the systems

03:34.580 --> 03:39.580
because we really, you got to make sure everything works.

03:40.580 --> 03:43.180
It was definitely a lot more enjoyable

03:43.180 --> 03:46.580
with the subsequent astronaut missions.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.780
And I thought the Inspiration mission

03:49.780 --> 03:53.580
was actually a very inspiring Inspiration 4 mission.

03:53.580 --> 03:56.980
I'd encourage people to watch the Inspiration documentary

03:56.980 --> 03:58.980
on Netflix, it's actually really good.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.980
And it really isn't, I was actually inspired by that.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.980
So that one I felt I was kind of able to enjoy

04:07.980 --> 04:09.980
the actual mission and not just be super stressed

04:09.980 --> 04:10.980
all the time.

04:10.980 --> 04:13.380
So for people that somehow don't know,

04:13.380 --> 04:16.980
it's the all civilian, first time all civilian

04:16.980 --> 04:18.980
out to space, out to orbit.

04:18.980 --> 04:22.180
Yeah, and it was I think the highest orbit

04:22.180 --> 04:25.780
that in like 30 or 40 years or something,

04:25.780 --> 04:28.980
the only one that was higher was the one shuttle

04:29.580 --> 04:32.180
sorry, Hubble servicing mission.

04:32.180 --> 04:35.980
And then before that it would have been Apollo in 72.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.180
It's pretty wild.

04:39.180 --> 04:44.180
So it's cool, I think as a species,

04:44.580 --> 04:48.180
like we want to be continuing to do better

04:48.180 --> 04:51.180
and reach higher ground and like,

04:51.180 --> 04:52.980
I think it would be tragic, extremely tragic

04:52.980 --> 04:56.980
if Apollo was the high water mark for humanity,

04:56.980 --> 04:58.780
and that's as far as we ever got.

05:00.080 --> 05:05.080
And it's concerning that here we are 49 years

05:06.380 --> 05:09.080
after the last mission to the moon.

05:09.080 --> 05:14.080
And so almost half a century and we've not been back

05:14.080 --> 05:16.280
and that's worrying.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.380
It's like, does that mean we've peaked

05:19.380 --> 05:20.980
as a civilization or what?

05:20.980 --> 05:24.480
So like, I think we got to get back to the moon

05:24.680 --> 05:27.180
and build a base there, a science base.

05:27.180 --> 05:28.880
I think we could learn a lot about the nature

05:28.880 --> 05:31.080
of the universe if we have a proper science base

05:31.080 --> 05:35.480
on the moon, like we have a science base in Antarctica

05:35.480 --> 05:38.080
and many other parts of the world.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.880
And so that's the, I think the next big thing

05:41.880 --> 05:45.680
we've got to have like a serious like moon base

05:45.680 --> 05:49.980
and then get people to Mars and get out there

05:49.980 --> 05:52.580
and be a space bearing civilization.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.480
I'll ask you about some of those details,

05:54.480 --> 05:57.480
but since you're so busy with the hard engineering

05:57.480 --> 06:00.080
challenges of everything that's involved,

06:00.080 --> 06:02.980
are you still able to marvel at the magic of it all,

06:02.980 --> 06:05.880
of space travel, of every time the rocket goes up,

06:05.880 --> 06:08.180
especially when it's a crewed mission?

06:08.180 --> 06:11.480
Are you just so overwhelmed with all the challenges

06:11.480 --> 06:12.580
that you have to solve?

06:13.480 --> 06:16.280
And actually sort of to add to that,

06:16.280 --> 06:19.580
the reason I wanted to ask this question of May 30th,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
it's been some time so you can look back

06:21.880 --> 06:23.580
and think about the impact already.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.380
It's already, at the time it was an engineering problem

06:26.380 --> 06:29.380
maybe, now it's becoming a historic moment.

06:29.380 --> 06:31.680
Like it's a moment that, how many moments

06:31.680 --> 06:33.780
would be remembered about the 21st century?

06:33.780 --> 06:38.580
To me, that or something like that maybe inspiration for

06:38.580 --> 06:40.780
one of those would be remembered as the early steps

06:40.780 --> 06:43.180
of a new age of space exploration.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.680
Yeah, I mean, during the launches itself,

06:46.680 --> 06:49.180
so I mean, I think maybe some people will know,

06:49.180 --> 06:50.180
but a lot of people don't know,

06:50.180 --> 06:52.080
is like I'm actually the chief engineer of SpaceX.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.680
So the, I've signed off on pretty much

06:56.680 --> 06:57.980
all the design decisions.

06:59.080 --> 07:03.080
And so if there's something that goes wrong

07:03.080 --> 07:07.080
with that vehicle, it's fundamentally my fault.

07:07.080 --> 07:12.080
So I'm really just thinking about all the things that,

07:13.780 --> 07:15.580
like so when I see the rocket,

07:15.580 --> 07:17.280
I see all the things that could go wrong

07:17.280 --> 07:18.480
and the things that could be better

07:18.480 --> 07:21.480
and the same with the Dragon spacecraft.

07:21.480 --> 07:25.080
It's like other people say, oh, this is a spacecraft

07:25.080 --> 07:26.980
or a rocket and this looks really cool.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.580
I'm like, I've like a readout of like,

07:29.580 --> 07:31.180
this is the, these are the risks,

07:31.180 --> 07:33.780
these are the problems, that's what I see.

07:33.780 --> 07:38.780
Like, so it's not what other people see

07:38.780 --> 07:40.380
when they see the product, you know.

07:40.380 --> 07:42.980
So let me ask you then to analyze Starship

07:42.980 --> 07:44.280
in that same way.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.180
I know you have, you'll talk about in more detail

07:47.180 --> 07:49.480
about Starship in the near future, perhaps.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.780
Yeah, we can talk about it now if you want.

07:51.780 --> 07:54.080
But just in that same way, like you said,

07:54.080 --> 07:57.580
you see when you see a rocket,

07:57.580 --> 07:59.080
you see a sort of a list of risks.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.980
In that same way, you said that Starship

08:00.980 --> 08:03.180
is a really hard problem.

08:03.180 --> 08:05.380
So there's many ways I can ask this,

08:05.380 --> 08:09.480
but if you magically could solve one problem perfectly,

08:09.480 --> 08:11.680
one engineering problem perfectly,

08:11.680 --> 08:12.980
which one would it be?

08:12.980 --> 08:14.080
On Starship?

08:14.080 --> 08:15.480
On, sorry, on Starship.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.980
So is it maybe related to the efficiency,

08:17.980 --> 08:21.280
the engine, the weight of the different components,

08:21.280 --> 08:22.580
the complexity of various things,

08:22.580 --> 08:26.680
maybe the controls of the crazy thing has to do to land?

08:26.680 --> 08:29.980
No, it's actually, by far the biggest thing

08:29.980 --> 08:33.680
absorbing my time is engine production.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.380
Not the design of the engine,

08:36.380 --> 08:41.680
but I've often said prototypes are easy,

08:41.680 --> 08:42.780
production is hard.

08:43.280 --> 08:48.580
So we have the most advanced rocket engine

08:48.580 --> 08:50.080
that's ever been designed.

08:52.080 --> 08:55.180
Because I say currently the best rocket engine ever

08:55.180 --> 08:58.480
is probably the RD-180 or RD-170.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.480
That's the Russian engine, basically.

09:03.580 --> 09:06.680
And still, I think an engine generally can't

09:06.680 --> 09:08.980
if it's gotten something to orbit.

09:08.980 --> 09:12.680
So our engine has not gotten anything to orbit yet,

09:13.680 --> 09:16.980
but it's the first engine that's actually better

09:16.980 --> 09:21.980
than the Russian RD engines, which were amazing design.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.080
So you're talking about Raptor engine.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.480
What makes it amazing?

09:25.480 --> 09:29.580
What are the different aspects of it that make it,

09:29.580 --> 09:31.880
what are you the most excited about

09:31.880 --> 09:35.080
if the whole thing works in terms of efficiency,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.080
all those kinds of things?

09:37.080 --> 09:42.080
Well, the Raptor is a full flow staged combustion engine

09:46.280 --> 09:50.780
and it's operating at a very high chamber pressure.

09:50.780 --> 09:52.580
So one of the key figures of merit,

09:53.580 --> 09:55.580
perhaps the key figure of merit is

09:56.880 --> 09:58.680
what is the chamber pressure

09:58.680 --> 10:00.780
at which the rocket engine can operate?

10:00.780 --> 10:02.980
That's the combustion chamber pressure.

10:02.980 --> 10:06.880
So a Raptor is designed to operate at 300 bar

10:06.880 --> 10:10.280
possibly maybe higher, a standard atmospheres.

10:10.280 --> 10:15.280
So the record right now for operational engine

10:15.880 --> 10:17.880
is the RD engine that I mentioned, the Russian RD,

10:17.880 --> 10:21.280
which is I believe around 267 bar.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.080
And the difficulty of the chamber pressure

10:26.080 --> 10:27.880
increases on a non-linear basis.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.880
So 10% more chamber pressure is more like 50% more difficult.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.680
But that chamber pressure is,

10:38.680 --> 10:41.980
that is what allows you to get a very high

10:41.980 --> 10:45.180
power density for the engine.

10:46.180 --> 10:51.180
So enabling a very high thrust to weight ratio

10:53.280 --> 10:56.980
and a very high specific impulse.

10:56.980 --> 10:59.780
So specific impulse is like a measure of the efficiency

10:59.780 --> 11:00.680
of a rocket engine.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.680
It's really the effect of exhaust velocity

11:07.780 --> 11:10.080
of the gas coming out of the engine.

11:12.780 --> 11:17.080
So with a very high chamber pressure,

11:17.080 --> 11:22.080
you can have a compact engine that nonetheless

11:22.180 --> 11:23.980
has a high expansion ratio,

11:23.980 --> 11:28.980
which is the ratio between the exit nozzle

11:29.480 --> 11:31.780
and the throat.

11:31.780 --> 11:35.980
So you see rocket engines got sort of like a hourglass shape.

11:35.980 --> 11:38.180
It's like a chamber and then at next down

11:38.180 --> 11:41.880
and there's a nozzle and the ratio of the exit diameter

11:41.880 --> 11:45.980
to the throat expansion ratio.

11:45.980 --> 11:49.680
So why is it such a hard engine to manufacture at scale?

11:51.380 --> 11:53.080
It's very complex.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.180
So what does complexity mean here?

11:55.180 --> 11:56.780
There's a lot of components involved.

11:56.780 --> 12:01.780
There's a lot of components and a lot of unique materials.

12:03.080 --> 12:07.880
So we had to invent several alloys that don't exist

12:07.880 --> 12:09.580
in order to make this engine work.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.080
So it's a materials problem too.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.280
It's a materials problem.

12:16.280 --> 12:21.180
And in a stage combustion, a full-flow stage combustion,

12:21.180 --> 12:24.180
there are many feedback loops in the system.

12:24.180 --> 12:29.180
So basically you've got propellant and hot gas flowing

12:34.980 --> 12:37.780
simultaneously to so many different places on the engine

12:39.180 --> 12:43.780
and they all have a recursive effect on each other.

12:43.780 --> 12:44.880
So you change one thing here,

12:44.880 --> 12:46.080
it has a recursive effect here,

12:46.080 --> 12:47.480
it changes something over there

12:47.480 --> 12:51.480
and it's quite hard to control.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.880
Like there's a reason no one's made this before.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.680
And the reason we're doing a stage combustion full-flow

13:04.580 --> 13:08.680
is because it has the highest

13:08.680 --> 13:10.880
theoretical possible efficiency.

13:12.580 --> 13:17.580
So in order to make a fully reusable rocket,

13:18.180 --> 13:23.180
which that's the really the holy grail of orbital rocketry.

13:25.280 --> 13:28.380
You have to have, everything's got to be the best.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.880
It's got to be the best engine, the best airframe,

13:30.880 --> 13:35.880
the best heat shield, extremely light avionics,

13:38.080 --> 13:40.580
very clever control mechanisms.

13:40.580 --> 13:45.080
You've got to shed mass in any possible way that you can.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.380
For example, we are,

13:46.380 --> 13:48.680
instead of putting landing legs on the booster and ship,

13:48.680 --> 13:50.680
we are going to catch them with a tower

13:50.680 --> 13:53.180
to save the weight of the landing legs.

13:53.180 --> 13:56.380
So that's like, I mean,

13:56.380 --> 13:58.280
we're talking about catching

13:58.280 --> 14:00.180
the largest flying object ever made

14:03.280 --> 14:06.580
on a giant tower with chopstick arms.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.580
It's like karate kid with the fly, but much bigger.

14:09.880 --> 14:14.880
This probably won't work the first time.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.780
Anyway, so this is bananas, this is banana stuff.

14:19.780 --> 14:23.080
So you mentioned that you doubt, well, not you doubt,

14:23.080 --> 14:25.880
but there's days or moments

14:25.880 --> 14:28.380
when you doubt that this is even possible.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.080
It's so difficult.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.080
The possible part is, well, at this point,

14:35.380 --> 14:37.480
I think we will get Starship to work.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.880
There's a question of timing.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.480
How long will it take us to do this?

14:45.480 --> 14:47.680
How long will it take us to actually achieve

14:47.680 --> 14:49.080
full and rapid reusability?

14:50.480 --> 14:52.680
Because it will take probably many launches

14:52.680 --> 14:55.680
before we are able to have full and rapid reusability.

14:57.680 --> 15:01.180
But I can say that the physics pencils out.

15:06.180 --> 15:09.080
At this point, I'd say we're confident that,

15:10.080 --> 15:12.580
I'm very confident success is in the set

15:12.580 --> 15:13.780
of all possible outcomes.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.280
For a while there, I was not convinced

15:18.280 --> 15:20.780
that success was in the set of possible outcomes,

15:21.780 --> 15:23.380
which is very important actually.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.680
You're saying there's a chance.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.580
I'm saying there's a chance, exactly.

15:33.180 --> 15:37.080
Just not sure how long it will take.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.580
But we have a very talented team.

15:39.580 --> 15:41.980
They're working night and day to make it happen.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.980
The critical thing to achieve for the revolution

15:48.980 --> 15:50.580
in spaceflight and for humanity

15:50.580 --> 15:51.980
to be a spacefaring civilization

15:51.980 --> 15:54.380
is to have a fully and rapidly reusable rocket,

15:54.380 --> 15:55.180
orbital rocket.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.780
There's not even been any orbital rocket

15:58.780 --> 16:00.080
that's been fully reusable ever.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.980
And this has always been the holy grail of rocketry.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.680
Many smart people, very smart people,

16:09.680 --> 16:12.580
have tried to do this before and they've not succeeded.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.080
Because it's such a hard problem.

16:16.980 --> 16:21.180
What's your source of belief in situations like this?

16:21.180 --> 16:23.580
When the engineering problem is so difficult,

16:23.580 --> 16:27.480
there's a lot of experts, many of whom you admire,

16:27.480 --> 16:28.980
who have failed in the past.

16:29.980 --> 16:33.980
And a lot of people,

16:36.180 --> 16:37.980
a lot of experts, maybe journalists,

16:37.980 --> 16:39.880
all the kind of, the public in general

16:39.880 --> 16:42.780
have a lot of doubt about whether it's possible.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.280
And you yourself know that even if it's a non-null set,

16:47.280 --> 16:49.480
non-empty set of success,

16:49.480 --> 16:52.080
it's still unlikely or very difficult.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.480
Like, where do you go to?

16:53.480 --> 16:57.280
Both personally, intellectually as an engineer,

16:57.280 --> 17:00.880
as a team, like for source of strength needed

17:00.880 --> 17:02.480
to sort of persevere through this

17:03.580 --> 17:06.380
and to keep going with the project, take it to completion.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.880
A source of strength.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.080
That's really not how I think about things.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.580
I mean, for me, it's simply this is something

17:25.580 --> 17:27.080
that is important to get done.

17:28.080 --> 17:32.480
And we should just keep doing it or die trying.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.980
And I don't need a source of strength.

17:35.980 --> 17:39.080
So quitting is not even like...

17:39.080 --> 17:41.580
That's not, it's not in my nature.

17:41.580 --> 17:45.080
And I don't care about optimism or pessimism.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.880
Fuck that, we're gonna get it done.

17:47.880 --> 17:48.780
Gonna get it done.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.180
Can you then zoom back in to specific problems

17:55.180 --> 17:58.280
with Starship or any engineering problems you work on?

17:58.280 --> 17:59.980
Can you try to introspect

17:59.980 --> 18:02.180
your particular biological neural network,

18:02.180 --> 18:03.480
your thinking process,

18:03.480 --> 18:06.080
and describe how you think through problems,

18:06.080 --> 18:07.880
the different engineering and design problems?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.980
Is there like a systematic process?

18:09.980 --> 18:11.780
You've spoken about first principles thinking,

18:11.780 --> 18:14.080
but is there a kind of process to it?

18:14.080 --> 18:19.080
Well, you know, I like saying like physics is low

18:19.080 --> 18:21.580
and everything else is a recommendation.

18:21.580 --> 18:23.080
Like I've met a lot of people that can break the law,

18:23.180 --> 18:25.480
but I haven't met anyone who could break physics.

18:26.680 --> 18:31.680
So first for any kind of technology problem,

18:32.480 --> 18:34.480
you have to sort of just make sure

18:34.480 --> 18:37.780
you're not violating physics.

18:39.880 --> 18:44.780
And, you know, first principles analysis,

18:44.780 --> 18:45.880
I think is something that can be applied

18:45.880 --> 18:49.780
to really any walk of life, anything really.

18:49.780 --> 18:53.280
It's really just saying, you know,

18:53.280 --> 18:58.380
let's boil something down to the most fundamental principles.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.780
The things that we are most confident are true

19:00.780 --> 19:02.480
at a foundational level.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.980
And that sets your axiomatic base,

19:04.980 --> 19:06.980
and then you reason up from there,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.980
and then you cross-check your conclusion

19:08.980 --> 19:11.280
against the axiomatic truths.

19:13.580 --> 19:18.080
So, you know, some basics in physics would be like,

19:18.080 --> 19:19.580
are you violating conservation of energy

19:19.580 --> 19:21.180
or momentum or something like that?

19:21.180 --> 19:23.680
You know, then it's not gonna work.

19:25.780 --> 19:30.780
So that's just to establish, is it possible?

19:32.980 --> 19:34.780
And then another good physics tool

19:34.780 --> 19:36.480
is thinking about things in the limit.

19:36.480 --> 19:38.380
If you take a particular thing

19:38.380 --> 19:41.680
and you scale it to a very large number

19:41.680 --> 19:44.880
or to a very small number, how do things change?

19:45.980 --> 19:48.980
Well, like in number of things you manufacture

19:48.980 --> 19:51.680
something like that, and then in time?

19:51.680 --> 19:55.980
Yeah, like let's say take an example of like manufacturing,

19:55.980 --> 19:59.180
which I think is just a very underrated problem.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.580
And like I said, it's much harder

20:04.580 --> 20:09.580
to take an advanced technology product

20:09.580 --> 20:11.080
and bring it into volume manufacturing

20:11.080 --> 20:12.980
than it is to design it in the first place.

20:12.980 --> 20:14.580
Or as magnitude.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.880
So let's say you're trying to figure out

20:17.880 --> 20:22.880
is like, why is this part or product expensive?

20:23.980 --> 20:27.480
Is it because of something fundamentally foolish

20:27.480 --> 20:31.380
that we're doing, or is it because our volume is too low?

20:31.380 --> 20:32.880
And so then you say, okay, well, what if our volume

20:32.880 --> 20:34.280
was a million units a year?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.780
Is it still expensive?

20:35.780 --> 20:38.180
That's what I'm thinking about things in the limit.

20:38.180 --> 20:40.180
If it's still expensive at a million units a year,

20:40.180 --> 20:42.580
then volume is not the reason why your thing is expensive.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.780
There's something fundamental about the design.

20:44.780 --> 20:47.480
And then you then can focus on reducing complexity

20:47.480 --> 20:48.680
or something like that in the design.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.280
Change the design to change the part to be something

20:51.280 --> 20:55.580
that is not fundamentally expensive.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.980
But like that's a common thing in rocketry

20:58.980 --> 21:01.880
because the unit volume is relatively low.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.880
And so a common excuse would be, well, it's expensive

21:04.880 --> 21:06.480
because our unit volume is low.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.780
And if we were in like automotive or something like that

21:08.780 --> 21:10.980
or consumer electronics, then our costs would be lower.

21:10.980 --> 21:13.080
I'm like, okay, so let's say we,

21:13.080 --> 21:14.680
now you're making a million units a year.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.180
Is it still expensive?

21:16.180 --> 21:20.680
If the answer is yes, then economies of scale

21:20.680 --> 21:22.280
are not the issue.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.280
Do you throw into manufacturing,

21:24.280 --> 21:26.180
do you throw like supply chain,

21:26.180 --> 21:27.880
you talked about resources and materials

21:27.880 --> 21:28.780
and stuff like that.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.080
Do you throw that into the calculation

21:30.080 --> 21:31.980
of trying to reason from first principles

21:31.980 --> 21:34.780
like how we're gonna make the supply chain work here?

21:34.780 --> 21:35.880
Yeah, yeah.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.980
And then the cost of materials, things like that.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.080
Or is that too much?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.980
Exactly, so like a good example,

21:41.980 --> 21:44.580
I think of thinking about things in the limit

21:44.580 --> 21:49.580
is if you take any product, any machine or whatever,

21:54.380 --> 21:56.080
like take a rocket or whatever,

21:56.080 --> 22:01.080
and say, if you look at the raw materials in the rocket,

22:03.680 --> 22:07.580
so you're gonna have like aluminum, steel, titanium,

22:07.580 --> 22:12.580
inconel, specialty alloys, copper,

22:13.480 --> 22:18.480
and you say, what's the weight of the constituent elements

22:19.180 --> 22:20.380
of each of these elements?

22:20.380 --> 22:22.580
And what is their raw material value?

22:22.580 --> 22:25.680
And that sets the asymptotic limit

22:25.680 --> 22:29.480
for how low the cost of the vehicle can be

22:29.480 --> 22:31.780
unless you change the materials.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.980
So, and then when you do that,

22:33.980 --> 22:35.780
I call it like maybe the magic one number

22:35.780 --> 22:36.600
or something like that.

22:36.600 --> 22:39.380
So that would be like if you had the,

22:40.380 --> 22:42.580
like just a pile of these raw materials here

22:42.580 --> 22:43.680
and you could wave magic wand

22:43.680 --> 22:45.980
and rearrange the atoms into the final shape,

22:47.180 --> 22:49.580
that would be the lowest possible cost

22:49.580 --> 22:50.980
that you could make this thing for

22:50.980 --> 22:52.780
unless you change the materials.

22:52.780 --> 22:56.380
So then, and that is almost always a very low number.

22:57.780 --> 23:01.180
So then what's actually causing these to be expensive

23:01.180 --> 23:04.080
is how you put the atoms into the desired shape.

23:05.980 --> 23:09.180
Yeah, actually, if you don't mind me taking a tiny tangent,

23:10.080 --> 23:11.380
I often talk to Jim Keller,

23:11.380 --> 23:14.380
who's somebody that worked with you as a friend.

23:14.380 --> 23:17.780
Jim was, yeah, did great work at Tesla.

23:17.780 --> 23:20.480
So I suppose he carries the flame

23:20.480 --> 23:22.680
of the same kind of thinking

23:22.680 --> 23:24.580
that you're talking about now.

23:26.180 --> 23:28.580
And I guess I see that same thing at Tesla

23:28.580 --> 23:31.780
and SpaceX folks who work there,

23:31.780 --> 23:33.780
they kind of learn this way of thinking

23:33.780 --> 23:36.680
and it kind of becomes obvious almost.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.680
But anyway, I had argument, not argument,

23:40.880 --> 23:44.780
he educated me about how cheap it might be

23:44.780 --> 23:46.580
to manufacture a Tesla bot.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.380
We just, we had an argument.

23:48.380 --> 23:52.080
How can you reduce the cost of scale of producing a robot?

23:52.080 --> 23:55.980
Because I've gotten the chance to interact quite a bit,

23:55.980 --> 23:59.480
obviously, in the academic circles with humanoid robots

23:59.480 --> 24:01.880
and then my Boston Dynamics and stuff like that.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.480
And then they're very expensive to build.

24:04.580 --> 24:07.680
And then Jim kind of schooled me on saying like,

24:07.680 --> 24:10.180
okay, like this kind of first principles thinking

24:10.180 --> 24:12.680
of how can we get the cost of manufacturing down?

24:13.880 --> 24:14.780
I suppose you do that,

24:14.780 --> 24:17.780
you have done that kind of thinking for Tesla bot

24:17.780 --> 24:21.980
and for all kinds of complex systems

24:21.980 --> 24:23.780
that are traditionally seen as complex.

24:23.780 --> 24:27.280
And you say, okay, how can we simplify everything down?

24:27.280 --> 24:28.680
Yeah.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.480
I mean, I think if you are really good at manufacturing,

24:32.380 --> 24:35.380
you can basically make at high volume,

24:35.380 --> 24:37.580
you can basically make anything for a cost

24:38.480 --> 24:42.080
that asymptotically approaches the raw material value

24:42.080 --> 24:44.680
of the constituents plus any intellectual property

24:44.680 --> 24:47.180
that you need to do license, anything.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.280
But it's hard.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.880
It's not like that's a very hard thing to do,

24:51.880 --> 24:54.780
but it is possible for anything.

24:54.780 --> 24:57.580
Anything in volume can be made of, like I said,

24:57.580 --> 25:00.480
for a cost that asymptotically approaches

25:00.480 --> 25:02.680
raw material constituents

25:02.680 --> 25:05.280
plus intellectual property license rights.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.380
So what will often happen in trying to design a product

25:08.380 --> 25:10.680
is people will start with the tools

25:10.680 --> 25:13.480
and parts and methods that they are familiar with

25:14.380 --> 25:17.380
and then, and try to create a product

25:17.380 --> 25:19.480
using their existing tools and methods.

25:21.180 --> 25:24.980
The other way to think about it is actually imagine the,

25:24.980 --> 25:28.680
try to imagine the platonic ideal of the perfect product

25:28.880 --> 25:31.380
or technology, whatever it might be.

25:31.380 --> 25:35.680
And say, what is the perfect arrangement of atoms

25:35.680 --> 25:38.580
that would be the best possible product?

25:38.580 --> 25:39.880
And now let us try to figure out

25:39.880 --> 25:41.580
how to get the atoms in that shape.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.580
I mean, it sounds,

25:47.980 --> 25:50.380
it's almost like Rick and Morty absurd

25:50.380 --> 25:52.080
until you start to really think about it

25:52.080 --> 25:56.480
and you really should think about it in this way

25:56.480 --> 25:58.180
because everything else is kind of,

25:59.080 --> 26:03.080
if you think, you might fall victim to the momentum

26:03.080 --> 26:04.580
of the way things were done in the past

26:04.580 --> 26:06.080
unless you think in this way.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.780
Well, just as a function of inertia,

26:07.780 --> 26:10.780
people will want to use the same tools and methods

26:10.780 --> 26:12.180
that they are familiar with.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.780
They just, that's what they'll do by default.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.780
And then that will lead to an outcome of things

26:18.780 --> 26:20.580
that can be made with those tools and methods,

26:20.580 --> 26:23.980
but is unlikely to be the platonic ideal

26:23.980 --> 26:25.180
of the perfect product.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.480
So then, so that's why,

26:28.480 --> 26:30.180
it's good to think of things in both directions.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.280
So like, what can we build with the tools that we have?

26:32.280 --> 26:35.680
But then, but also what is the perfect,

26:35.680 --> 26:37.380
the theoretical perfect product look like?

26:37.380 --> 26:39.680
And that theoretical perfect product

26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
is gonna be a moving target

26:40.680 --> 26:42.780
because as you learn more,

26:42.780 --> 26:46.980
the definition of that perfect product will change

26:46.980 --> 26:48.780
because you don't actually know what the perfect product is,

26:48.780 --> 26:53.180
but you can successfully approximate a more perfect product.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.480
So think about it like that and then saying,

26:56.480 --> 26:59.180
okay, now what tools, methods, materials,

26:59.180 --> 27:02.280
whatever do we need to create

27:02.280 --> 27:04.380
in order to get the atoms in that shape?

27:05.780 --> 27:09.880
But people rarely think about it that way,

27:09.880 --> 27:11.480
but it's a powerful tool.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.580
I should mention that the brilliant Siobhan Zillis

27:15.580 --> 27:18.580
is hanging out with us

27:18.780 --> 27:23.180
in case you hear a voice of wisdom from outside,

27:23.180 --> 27:24.080
from up above.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.180
Okay, so let me ask you about Mars.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.380
You mentioned it would be great for science

27:30.380 --> 27:34.980
to put a base on the moon to do some research,

27:34.980 --> 27:38.380
but the truly big leap,

27:38.380 --> 27:40.880
again, in this category of seemingly impossible,

27:40.880 --> 27:43.780
is to put a human being on Mars.

27:43.780 --> 27:46.880
When do you think SpaceX will land a human being on Mars?

27:49.580 --> 27:50.380
Hmm.

28:08.180 --> 28:11.980
Best case is about five years, worst case, 10 years.

28:12.780 --> 28:15.180
What are the determining factors, would you say,

28:15.180 --> 28:16.780
from an engineering perspective,

28:16.780 --> 28:18.780
or is that not the bottlenecks?

28:19.780 --> 28:24.580
You know, it's fundamentally engineering the vehicle.

28:28.180 --> 28:32.380
I mean, Starship is the most complex and advanced rocket

28:32.380 --> 28:35.180
that's ever been made by, I don't know,

28:35.180 --> 28:36.580
what a magnitude or something like that.

28:36.580 --> 28:37.380
It's a lot.

28:37.580 --> 28:40.580
And the fundamental optimization of Starship

28:40.580 --> 28:42.980
is minimizing cost per ton to orbit

28:42.980 --> 28:45.980
and ultimately cost per ton to the surface of Mars.

28:45.980 --> 28:47.780
This may seem like a mercantile objective,

28:47.780 --> 28:50.980
but it is actually the thing that needs to be optimized.

28:50.980 --> 28:55.580
Like, there is a certain cost per ton to the surface of Mars

28:55.580 --> 28:59.780
where we can afford to establish a self-sustaining system.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.980
And that's something that we need to be able to do.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.980
And I think that's a really important point

29:04.980 --> 29:08.780
to be able to afford to establish a self-sustaining city.

29:08.780 --> 29:12.780
And then above that, we cannot afford to do it.

29:12.780 --> 29:16.780
So right now, you couldn't fly to Mars for a trillion dollars.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.180
No amount of money could get you a ticket to Mars.

29:19.180 --> 29:22.380
So we need to get that above, you know,

29:22.380 --> 29:25.380
to get that, like, something that is actually possible at all.

29:27.780 --> 29:32.180
But then, we don't just want to have, you know,

29:32.180 --> 29:33.780
with Mars, flags and footprints

29:33.780 --> 29:35.780
and then not come back for a half century,

29:35.780 --> 29:37.980
like we did with the Moon.

29:37.980 --> 29:43.380
In order to pass a very important, great filter,

29:43.380 --> 29:46.180
I think we need to be a multi-planet species.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.380
This may sound somewhat esoteric to a lot of people,

29:51.380 --> 29:57.180
but eventually, given enough time,

29:57.180 --> 30:02.180
that's something Earth is likely to experience some calamity.

30:02.180 --> 30:06.780
There could be something that humans do to themselves

30:06.780 --> 30:09.580
or an external event, like happened to the dinosaurs.

30:12.580 --> 30:17.980
But eventually, if none of that happens

30:17.980 --> 30:21.180
and somehow, magically, we keep going,

30:21.180 --> 30:24.780
then the Sun is gradually expanding

30:24.780 --> 30:26.580
and will engulf the Earth.

30:26.580 --> 30:30.980
And probably, Earth gets too hot for life

30:30.980 --> 30:34.780
in about 500 million years.

30:34.780 --> 30:37.180
It's a long time, but that's only 10% longer

30:37.180 --> 30:39.380
than Earth has been around.

30:39.380 --> 30:43.180
And so, if you think about, like, the current situation,

30:43.180 --> 30:45.580
it's really remarkable and kind of hard to believe,

30:45.580 --> 30:49.980
but Earth's been around for 1.5 billion years

30:49.980 --> 30:52.180
and this is the first time in 4.5 billion years

30:52.180 --> 30:55.580
that it's been possible to extend life beyond Earth.

30:55.580 --> 30:58.580
And that window of opportunity may be open for a long time,

30:58.580 --> 31:01.580
and I hope it is, but it also may be open for a short time.

31:01.580 --> 31:09.380
And I think it was wise for us to act quickly

31:09.380 --> 31:13.580
while the window is open, just in case it closes.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.580
Yeah, the existence of nuclear weapons, pandemics,

31:17.580 --> 31:24.780
all kinds of threats should kind of give us some motivation.

31:24.780 --> 31:30.780
I mean, civilization could die with a bang or a whimper.

31:30.780 --> 31:34.780
You know, if it dies, the demographic could collapse,

31:34.780 --> 31:37.780
then it's more of a whimper, obviously.

31:37.780 --> 31:40.780
And if it's World War III, it's more of a bang.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.780
But these are all risks.

31:42.780 --> 31:44.780
I mean, it's important to think of these things

31:44.780 --> 31:48.780
and just think of things as, like, probabilities, not certainties.

31:48.780 --> 31:52.780
There's a certain probability that something bad will happen on Earth.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.780
I think most likely the future will be good.

31:55.780 --> 31:58.780
But there's, like, let's say for argument's sake,

31:58.780 --> 32:03.780
a 1% chance per century of a civilization ending event.

32:03.780 --> 32:06.780
Like, that was Stephen Hawking's estimate.

32:06.780 --> 32:09.780
I think he might be right about that.

32:09.780 --> 32:17.780
So then, you know, we should basically think of this

32:17.780 --> 32:19.780
like being a multi-planet species,

32:19.780 --> 32:21.780
just like taking out insurance for life itself.

32:21.780 --> 32:23.780
Life insurance for life.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.780
It's turned into infomercial real quick.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.780
Life insurance for life, yes.

32:30.780 --> 32:35.780
And, you know, we can bring the creatures from, you know,

32:35.780 --> 32:37.780
plants and animals from Earth to Mars

32:37.780 --> 32:40.780
and breathe life into the planet

32:40.780 --> 32:43.780
and have a second planet with life.

32:43.780 --> 32:45.780
That would be great.

32:45.780 --> 32:47.780
They can't bring themselves there, you know,

32:47.780 --> 32:49.780
so if we don't bring them to Mars,

32:49.780 --> 32:53.780
then they will just for sure all die when the sun expands anyway,

32:53.780 --> 32:55.780
and then that'll be it.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.780
What do you think is the most difficult aspect

32:57.780 --> 32:59.780
of building a civilization on Mars?

32:59.780 --> 33:02.780
Terraforming Mars, like, from an engineering perspective,

33:02.780 --> 33:06.780
from a financial perspective, human perspective,

33:06.780 --> 33:11.780
to get a large number of folks there

33:11.780 --> 33:14.780
who will never return back to Earth?

33:14.780 --> 33:16.780
No, they could certainly return.

33:16.780 --> 33:17.780
Some will return back to Earth.

33:17.780 --> 33:20.780
They will choose to stay there for the rest of their lives.

33:20.780 --> 33:22.780
Many will.

33:22.780 --> 33:27.780
But, you know, we need the spaceships back,

33:27.780 --> 33:29.780
like the ones that go to Mars, we need them back,

33:29.780 --> 33:31.780
so you can hop on if you want, you know.

33:31.780 --> 33:34.780
But we can't just not have the spaceships come back.

33:34.780 --> 33:35.780
Those things are expensive.

33:35.780 --> 33:36.780
We need them back.

33:36.780 --> 33:38.780
I'd like to come back and do another trip.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.780
I mean, do you think about the terraforming aspect,

33:40.780 --> 33:41.780
like, actually building?

33:41.780 --> 33:43.780
Are you so focused right now on the spaceships part

33:43.780 --> 33:45.780
that's so critical to get to Mars?

33:45.780 --> 33:48.780
We absolutely, if you can't get there, nothing else matters.

33:48.780 --> 33:51.780
And like I said, we can't get there

33:51.780 --> 33:53.780
at some extraordinarily high cost.

33:53.780 --> 33:56.780
I mean, the current cost of, let's say,

33:56.780 --> 34:01.780
one ton to the surface of Mars is on the order of a billion dollars.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.780
So, because you don't just need the rocket

34:03.780 --> 34:04.780
and the launch and everything.

34:04.780 --> 34:05.780
You need, like, a heat shield.

34:05.780 --> 34:08.780
You need, you know, guidance system.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.780
You need deep space communications.

34:11.780 --> 34:13.780
You need some kind of landing system.

34:13.780 --> 34:18.780
So, like, rough approximation would be a billion dollars per ton

34:18.780 --> 34:20.780
to the surface of Mars right now.

34:20.780 --> 34:25.780
This is obviously way too expensive

34:25.780 --> 34:29.780
to create a self-sustaining civilization.

34:29.780 --> 34:35.780
So we need to improve that by at least a factor of a thousand.

34:35.780 --> 34:37.780
A million per ton?

34:37.780 --> 34:39.780
Yes. Ideally, much less than a million ton.

34:40.780 --> 34:43.780
But if it's not, like, it's got to be,

34:43.780 --> 34:47.780
you have to say, like, well, how much can society afford to spend

34:47.780 --> 34:51.780
or just want to spend on a self-sustaining city on Mars?

34:51.780 --> 34:53.780
The self-sustaining part is important.

34:53.780 --> 34:56.780
Like, it's just the key threshold,

34:56.780 --> 35:00.780
the grateful will have been passed

35:00.780 --> 35:04.780
when the city on Mars can survive

35:04.780 --> 35:08.780
even if the spaceships from Earth stop coming for any reason.

35:08.780 --> 35:09.780
It doesn't matter what the reason is,

35:09.780 --> 35:11.780
but if they stop coming for any reason,

35:11.780 --> 35:13.780
will it die out or will it not?

35:13.780 --> 35:15.780
And if there's even one critical ingredient missing,

35:15.780 --> 35:17.780
then it still doesn't count.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.780
It's like, you know, if you're on a long sea voyage

35:19.780 --> 35:23.780
and you've got everything except vitamin C,

35:23.780 --> 35:25.780
it's only a matter of time, you know, you're going to die.

35:25.780 --> 35:31.780
So we've got to get Mars city to the point where it's self-sustaining.

35:31.780 --> 35:33.780
I'm not sure this will really happen in my lifetime,

35:33.780 --> 35:36.780
but I hope to see it at least have a lot of momentum.

35:36.780 --> 35:39.780
And then you could say, okay, what is the minimum tonnage

35:39.780 --> 35:42.780
necessary to have a self-sustaining city?

35:42.780 --> 35:45.780
And there's a lot of uncertainty about this.

35:45.780 --> 35:47.780
You could say, like, I don't know,

35:47.780 --> 35:50.780
it's probably at least a million tons

35:50.780 --> 35:54.780
because you have to set up a lot of infrastructure on Mars.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.780
Like I said, you can't be missing anything that,

35:58.780 --> 36:00.780
in order to be self-sustaining, you can't be missing,

36:00.780 --> 36:03.780
like you need, you know, semiconductor fabs,

36:03.780 --> 36:08.780
you need iron ore refineries, like you need lots of things, you know.

36:08.780 --> 36:12.780
So, and Mars is not super hospitable.

36:12.780 --> 36:14.780
It's the least inhospitable planet,

36:14.780 --> 36:17.780
but it's definitely a fixer-upper of a planet.

36:17.780 --> 36:18.780
Outside of Earth.

36:18.780 --> 36:19.780
Yes.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.780
Earth is pretty good.

36:20.780 --> 36:21.780
Earth is, like, easy.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.780
And also, we should clarify, in the solar system.

36:24.780 --> 36:25.780
Yes, in the solar system.

36:25.780 --> 36:28.780
There might be nice, like, vacation spots.

36:28.780 --> 36:31.780
There might be some great planets out there, but it's hopeless.

36:31.780 --> 36:32.780
Too hard to get there?

36:32.780 --> 36:36.780
Yeah, way, way, way, way, way too hard, to say the least.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.780
Let me push back on that.

36:37.780 --> 36:40.780
Not really a pushback, but a quick curveball of a question.

36:40.780 --> 36:43.780
So, you did mention physics as the first starting point.

36:43.780 --> 36:49.780
So, general relativity allows for wormholes.

36:49.780 --> 36:51.780
They technically can exist.

36:51.780 --> 36:54.780
Do you think those can ever be leveraged by humus

36:54.780 --> 36:57.780
to travel faster than the speed of light?

36:58.780 --> 37:02.780
Well, the wormhole thing is debatable.

37:02.780 --> 37:07.780
We currently do not know of any means

37:07.780 --> 37:10.780
of going faster than the speed of light.

37:10.780 --> 37:20.780
There are some ideas about having space.

37:20.780 --> 37:26.780
So, you can only move at the speed of light through space,

37:26.780 --> 37:33.780
but if you can make space itself move, that's warming space.

37:33.780 --> 37:38.780
Space is capable of moving faster than the speed of light.

37:38.780 --> 37:39.780
Right.

37:39.780 --> 37:41.780
Like the universe in the Big Bang,

37:41.780 --> 37:45.780
the universe expanded at much more than the speed of light, by a lot.

37:45.780 --> 37:46.780
Yeah.

37:46.780 --> 37:53.780
But if this is possible, the amount of energy required to wolf space

37:53.780 --> 37:57.780
is so gigantic, it boggles the mind.

37:57.780 --> 37:59.780
So, all the work you've done with propulsion,

37:59.780 --> 38:03.780
how much innovation is possible with rocket propulsion?

38:03.780 --> 38:05.780
I mean, you've seen it all,

38:05.780 --> 38:08.780
and you're constantly innovating in every aspect.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.780
How much is possible?

38:10.780 --> 38:12.780
Can you get 10X speed?

38:13.780 --> 38:15.780
Is there something in there in physics

38:15.780 --> 38:17.780
that you can get significant improvement

38:17.780 --> 38:20.780
in terms of efficiency of engines and all those kinds of things?

38:20.780 --> 38:22.780
Well, as I was saying,

38:22.780 --> 38:28.780
really the Holy Grail is a fully and rapidly reusable orbital system.

38:28.780 --> 38:37.780
So, right now, the Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket out there.

38:37.780 --> 38:39.780
But the booster comes back and lands,

38:39.780 --> 38:41.780
and you've seen the videos,

38:41.780 --> 38:43.780
and we get the nose-conal fairing back,

38:43.780 --> 38:45.780
but we do not get the upper stage back.

38:45.780 --> 38:52.780
So, that means that we have a minimum cost of building an upper stage.

38:52.780 --> 38:56.780
You can think of like a two-stage rocket of sort of like two airplanes,

38:56.780 --> 38:58.780
like a big airplane and a small airplane,

38:58.780 --> 39:01.780
and we get the big airplane back, but not the small airplane.

39:01.780 --> 39:03.780
And so, it still costs a lot.

39:03.780 --> 39:07.780
So, that upper stage is at least $10 million.

39:07.780 --> 39:12.780
And then the degree of the booster is not as rapidly

39:12.780 --> 39:15.780
and completely reusable as we'd like in order of the fairings.

39:15.780 --> 39:19.780
So, our kind of minimum marginal cost,

39:19.780 --> 39:21.780
not counting overhead per flight,

39:21.780 --> 39:27.780
is on the order of $15 to $20 million, maybe.

39:27.780 --> 39:30.780
So, that's extremely good for –

39:30.780 --> 39:33.780
it's by far better than any rocket ever in history.

39:33.780 --> 39:37.780
But with full and rapid reusability,

39:37.780 --> 39:44.780
we can reduce the cost per ton to orbit by a factor of 100.

39:44.780 --> 39:49.780
Just think of it like measuring if you had an aircraft or something,

39:49.780 --> 39:53.780
or an airplane or something like that.

39:53.780 --> 39:58.780
Like measuring if you had an aircraft or something or a car.

39:58.780 --> 40:04.780
And if you had to buy a new car every time you went for a drive,

40:04.780 --> 40:06.780
it would be very expensive.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.780
It would be silly, frankly.

40:08.780 --> 40:12.780
But in fact, you just refuel the car or recharge the car,

40:12.780 --> 40:19.780
and that makes your trip like, I don't know, a thousand times cheaper.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.780
So, it's the same for rockets.

40:22.780 --> 40:27.780
It's very difficult to make this complex machine that can go to orbit.

40:27.780 --> 40:29.780
And so, if you cannot reuse it

40:29.780 --> 40:33.780
and have to throw any significant part of it away,

40:33.780 --> 40:35.780
that massively increases the cost.

40:35.780 --> 40:42.780
So, Starship, in theory, could do a cost per launch

40:42.780 --> 40:45.780
of like a million, maybe $2 million or something like that.

40:45.780 --> 40:51.780
And put over 100 tons in orbit, which is crazy.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.780
Yeah, that's incredible.

40:53.780 --> 40:56.780
So, you're saying like it's by far the biggest bang for the buck

40:56.780 --> 40:58.780
is to make it fully reusable

40:58.780 --> 41:03.780
versus like some kind of brilliant breakthrough in theoretical physics?

41:03.780 --> 41:06.780
No, no, there's no brilliant breakthrough.

41:06.780 --> 41:08.780
Just make the rocket reusable.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.780
This is an extremely difficult engineering problem.

41:10.780 --> 41:11.780
Got it.

41:11.780 --> 41:13.780
But no new physics is required.

41:13.780 --> 41:14.780
Just brilliant engineering.

41:14.780 --> 41:17.780
Let me ask a slightly philosophical, fun question.

41:17.780 --> 41:18.780
Got to ask.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.780
I know you're focused on getting to Mars,

41:20.780 --> 41:24.780
but once we're there on Mars, what form of government,

41:24.780 --> 41:27.780
economic system, political system,

41:27.780 --> 41:32.780
do you think would work best for an early civilization of humans?

41:32.780 --> 41:36.780
I mean, the interesting reason to talk about this stuff,

41:36.780 --> 41:39.780
it also helps people dream about this.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.780
The interesting reason to talk about this stuff,

41:41.780 --> 41:44.780
it also helps people dream about the future.

41:44.780 --> 41:47.780
I know you're really focused about the short-term engineering dream,

41:47.780 --> 41:49.780
but it's like, I don't know,

41:49.780 --> 41:52.780
there's something about imagining an actual civilization on Mars

41:52.780 --> 41:55.780
that really gives people hope.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.780
Well, it would be a new frontier and an opportunity

41:57.780 --> 41:59.780
to rethink the whole nature of government,

41:59.780 --> 42:02.780
just as was done in the creation of the United States.

42:02.780 --> 42:13.780
So I would suggest having direct democracy,

42:13.780 --> 42:15.780
like people vote directly on things,

42:15.780 --> 42:17.780
as opposed to representative democracy.

42:17.780 --> 42:20.780
So representative democracy, I think,

42:20.780 --> 42:24.780
is too subject to special interests

42:24.780 --> 42:29.780
and a coercion of the politicians and that kind of thing.

42:30.780 --> 42:38.780
So I'd recommend that there's just direct democracy.

42:38.780 --> 42:41.780
People vote on laws, the population votes on laws themselves,

42:41.780 --> 42:43.780
and then the laws must be short enough

42:43.780 --> 42:45.780
that people can understand them.

42:45.780 --> 42:49.780
Yeah, and then keeping a well-informed populace,

42:49.780 --> 42:51.780
really being transparent about all the information,

42:51.780 --> 42:52.780
about what they're voting for.

42:52.780 --> 42:54.780
Yeah, absolute transparency.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.780
Yeah, and not make it as annoying as those cookies

42:56.780 --> 42:57.780
we have to accept.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.780
Accept cookies.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.780
There's always a slight amount of trepidation

43:02.780 --> 43:04.780
when you click accept cookies.

43:04.780 --> 43:07.780
I feel as though there's perhaps a very tiny chance

43:07.780 --> 43:10.780
that it'll open a portal to hell or something like that.

43:10.780 --> 43:12.780
That's exactly how I feel.

43:12.780 --> 43:15.780
Why do they keep wanting me to accept it?

43:15.780 --> 43:17.780
What do they want with this cookie?

43:17.780 --> 43:20.780
Somebody got upset with accepting cookies or something somewhere.

43:20.780 --> 43:22.780
Who cares?

43:22.780 --> 43:25.780
So annoying to keep accepting all these cookies.

43:25.780 --> 43:28.780
To me, this is just a great experience.

43:28.780 --> 43:29.780
Yes, you can have my damn cookie.

43:29.780 --> 43:30.780
I don't care.

43:30.780 --> 43:31.780
Whatever.

43:31.780 --> 43:32.780
He heard it from me on first.

43:32.780 --> 43:34.780
He accepts all your damn cookies.

43:34.780 --> 43:36.780
Yeah.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.780
And start asking me.

43:38.780 --> 43:40.780
It's annoying.

43:40.780 --> 43:44.780
Yeah, it's one example of implementation

43:44.780 --> 43:48.780
of a good idea done really horribly.

43:48.780 --> 43:51.780
Yeah, it's somebody who has some good intentions

43:51.780 --> 43:53.780
of privacy or whatever,

43:53.780 --> 43:55.780
but now everyone just has to accept cookies

43:55.780 --> 43:57.780
and it's now you have billions of people

43:57.780 --> 43:59.780
who have to keep clicking accept cookie.

43:59.780 --> 44:00.780
It's super annoying.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.780
Then we just accept the damn cookie.

44:02.780 --> 44:03.780
It's fine.

44:03.780 --> 44:06.780
There is I think a fundamental problem

44:06.780 --> 44:10.780
that because we've not really had a major,

44:10.780 --> 44:12.780
like a world war or something like that in a while,

44:12.780 --> 44:15.780
and obviously we would like to not have world wars,

44:15.780 --> 44:18.780
there's not been a cleansing function

44:18.780 --> 44:20.780
for rules and regulations.

44:21.780 --> 44:25.780
So wars did have some sort of lining in that

44:25.780 --> 44:30.780
there would be a reset on rules and regulations after a war.

44:30.780 --> 44:31.780
So world wars one and two,

44:31.780 --> 44:34.780
there were huge resets on rules and regulations.

44:34.780 --> 44:38.780
Now, if society does not have a war

44:38.780 --> 44:40.780
and there's no cleansing function

44:40.780 --> 44:42.780
or garbage collection for rules and regulations,

44:42.780 --> 44:44.780
then rules and regulations will accumulate every year

44:44.780 --> 44:45.780
because they're immortal.

44:45.780 --> 44:49.780
There's no actual humans die, but the laws don't.

44:49.780 --> 44:52.780
So we need a garbage collection function

44:52.780 --> 44:53.780
for rules and regulations.

44:53.780 --> 44:56.780
They should not just be immortal

44:56.780 --> 44:58.780
because some of the rules and regulations

44:58.780 --> 45:00.780
that are put in place will be counterproductive,

45:00.780 --> 45:02.780
done with good intentions, but counterproductive.

45:02.780 --> 45:04.780
Sometimes not done with good intentions.

45:04.780 --> 45:09.780
So if rules and regulations just accumulate every year

45:09.780 --> 45:11.780
and you get more and more of them,

45:11.780 --> 45:13.780
then eventually you won't be able to do anything.

45:13.780 --> 45:16.780
You're just like Gulliver tied down

45:16.780 --> 45:18.780
by thousands of little strings.

45:18.780 --> 45:25.780
And we see that in, you know, US and like basically

45:25.780 --> 45:29.780
all economies that have been around for a while

45:29.780 --> 45:34.780
and regulators and legislators create new rules

45:34.780 --> 45:35.780
and regulations every year,

45:35.780 --> 45:37.780
but they don't put effort into removing them.

45:37.780 --> 45:39.780
And I think that's very important that we put effort

45:39.780 --> 45:41.780
into removing rules and regulations.

45:41.780 --> 45:44.780
But it gets tough because you get special interests

45:44.780 --> 45:48.780
that then are dependent on, like they have, you know,

45:48.780 --> 45:51.780
a vested interest in that whatever rule and regulation

45:51.780 --> 45:56.780
and then they fight to not get it removed.

45:56.780 --> 46:00.780
Yeah, so I mean, I guess the problem with the Constitution

46:00.780 --> 46:03.780
is it's kind of like C versus Java

46:03.780 --> 46:06.780
because it doesn't have any garbage collection built in.

46:06.780 --> 46:08.780
I think there should be, when you first said

46:08.780 --> 46:10.780
the metaphor of garbage collection, I loved it.

46:10.780 --> 46:11.780
Yeah, it's from a coding standpoint.

46:11.780 --> 46:13.780
From a coding standpoint, yeah, yeah.

46:13.780 --> 46:16.780
It would be interesting if the laws themselves

46:16.780 --> 46:19.780
kind of had a built-in thing where they kind of die

46:19.780 --> 46:22.780
after a while unless somebody explicitly publicly defends them.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.780
Yeah.

46:23.780 --> 46:25.780
So that's sort of, it's not like somebody has to kill them,

46:25.780 --> 46:27.780
they kind of die themselves.

46:27.780 --> 46:28.780
They disappear.

46:28.780 --> 46:31.780
Yeah.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.780
Not to defend Java or anything, but, you know,

46:34.780 --> 46:37.780
C++, you know, you could also have great garbage collection

46:37.780 --> 46:39.780
in Python and so on.

46:39.780 --> 46:40.780
Yeah.

46:40.780 --> 46:43.780
So yeah, something needs to happen

46:43.780 --> 46:48.780
or just the civilization's arteries just harden over time

46:48.780 --> 46:50.780
and you can just get less and less done

46:50.780 --> 46:54.780
because there's just a rule against everything.

46:54.780 --> 46:58.780
So I think, I don't know, for Mars or whatever, I'd say,

46:58.780 --> 47:00.780
or even for, you know, obviously for Earth as well,

47:00.780 --> 47:02.780
I think there should be an active process

47:02.780 --> 47:04.780
for removing rules and regulations

47:04.780 --> 47:06.780
and questioning their existence.

47:06.780 --> 47:09.780
Just like if we've got a function

47:09.780 --> 47:10.780
for creating rules and regulations,

47:10.780 --> 47:12.780
because rules and regulations you can also think of

47:12.780 --> 47:15.780
as like they're like software or lines of code

47:15.780 --> 47:18.780
for operating civilization.

47:18.780 --> 47:20.780
That's the rules and regulations.

47:20.780 --> 47:22.780
So it's like we shouldn't have rules and regulations,

47:22.780 --> 47:26.780
but you have code accumulation, but no code removal.

47:26.780 --> 47:30.780
And so it just gets to become basically archaic bloatware

47:30.780 --> 47:32.780
after a while.

47:33.780 --> 47:37.780
And it's just, it makes it hard for things to progress.

47:37.780 --> 47:41.780
So I don't know, maybe Mars, you'd have like,

47:41.780 --> 47:44.780
you know, any given law must have a sunset, you know,

47:44.780 --> 47:49.780
and require active voting to restore,

47:49.780 --> 47:51.780
to keep it up there, you know.

47:51.780 --> 47:54.780
And I actually also say like, and these are just,

47:54.780 --> 47:57.780
I don't know, recommendations or thoughts

47:57.780 --> 48:00.780
and ultimately it will be up to the people on Mars to decide.

48:00.780 --> 48:05.780
But I think it should be easier to remove a law

48:06.780 --> 48:08.780
than to add one because of the,

48:08.780 --> 48:10.780
just to overcome the inertia of laws.

48:10.780 --> 48:14.780
So maybe it's like, for argument's sake,

48:14.780 --> 48:19.780
you need like say 60% vote to have a law take effect,

48:19.780 --> 48:22.780
but only a 40% vote to remove it.

48:22.780 --> 48:24.780
So let me be the guy.

48:24.780 --> 48:26.780
You posted a meme on Twitter recently

48:26.780 --> 48:29.780
where there's like a row of urinals

48:29.780 --> 48:32.780
and a guy just walks all the way across

48:32.780 --> 48:34.780
and he tells you about crypto.

48:34.780 --> 48:37.780
Listen, I mean, that's happened to me so many times,

48:37.780 --> 48:39.780
I think maybe even literally.

48:39.780 --> 48:40.780
Yeah.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.780
Do you think, technologically speaking,

48:42.780 --> 48:46.780
there's any room for ideas of smart contracts or so on?

48:46.780 --> 48:48.780
Because you mentioned laws.

48:48.780 --> 48:52.780
That's an interesting use of things like smart contracts

48:52.780 --> 48:56.780
to implement the laws by which governments function.

48:56.780 --> 49:01.780
Like something built on Ethereum or maybe a dog coin

49:01.780 --> 49:04.780
that enables smart contracts somehow.

49:04.780 --> 49:07.780
I don't quite understand this whole smart contract thing.

49:11.780 --> 49:14.780
I'm too dumb to understand smart contracts.

49:14.780 --> 49:16.780
That's a good line.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.780
I mean, my general approach to any kind of like deal

49:20.780 --> 49:23.780
or whatever is just make sure there's clarity of understanding.

49:23.780 --> 49:25.780
That's the most important thing.

49:25.780 --> 49:29.780
And just keep any kind of deal very short and simple,

49:29.780 --> 49:33.780
plain language, and just make sure everyone understands.

49:33.780 --> 49:36.780
This is the deal. Is it clear?

49:36.780 --> 49:42.780
And what are the consequences if various things don't happen?

49:42.780 --> 49:47.780
But usually deals are, business deals or whatever,

49:47.780 --> 49:52.780
are way too long and complex and overly layered and pointlessly.

49:52.780 --> 49:56.780
You mentioned that Doge is the people's coin.

49:56.780 --> 49:57.780
Yeah.

49:57.780 --> 49:59.780
And you said that you're literally going,

49:59.780 --> 50:07.780
SpaceX may consider literally putting a Doge coin on the moon.

50:07.780 --> 50:09.780
Is this something you're still considering?

50:09.780 --> 50:11.780
Mars perhaps?

50:11.780 --> 50:13.780
Do you think there's some chance,

50:13.780 --> 50:15.780
we've talked about political systems on Mars,

50:15.780 --> 50:21.780
that Dogecoin is the official currency of Mars at some point in the future?

50:21.780 --> 50:26.780
Well, I think Mars itself will need to have a different currency

50:26.780 --> 50:30.780
because you can't synchronize due to speed of light.

50:30.780 --> 50:32.780
Or not easily.

50:32.780 --> 50:35.780
So it must be completely standalone from Earth.

50:35.780 --> 50:40.780
Well, yeah, because Mars is at closest approach,

50:40.780 --> 50:42.780
it's four light minutes away roughly.

50:42.780 --> 50:46.780
And then at furthest approach, it's roughly 20 light minutes away,

50:46.780 --> 50:49.780
maybe a little more.

50:49.780 --> 50:52.780
So you can't really have something synchronizing,

50:52.780 --> 50:55.780
if you've got a 20-minute speed of light issue,

50:55.780 --> 50:57.780
if it's got a one-minute blockchain.

50:57.780 --> 51:00.780
It's not going to synchronize properly.

51:00.780 --> 51:04.780
So Mars would, I don't know if Mars would have a cryptocurrency as a thing,

51:04.780 --> 51:06.780
but probably, seems likely,

51:06.780 --> 51:11.780
but it would be some kind of localized thing on Mars.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.780
And you let the people decide?

51:14.780 --> 51:17.780
Yeah, absolutely.

51:17.780 --> 51:20.780
The future of Mars should be up to the Martians.

51:20.780 --> 51:28.780
Yeah, so I think the cryptocurrency thing is an interesting approach

51:28.780 --> 51:40.780
to reducing the error in the database that is called money.

51:40.780 --> 51:44.780
I think I have a pretty deep understanding of what money actually is

51:44.780 --> 51:49.780
on a practical day-to-day basis because of PayPal.

51:49.780 --> 51:54.780
We really got in deep there.

51:54.780 --> 51:58.780
And right now the money system, actually for practical purposes,

51:58.780 --> 52:06.780
is really a bunch of heterogeneous mainframes running old COBOL.

52:06.780 --> 52:08.780
Okay, you mean literally?

52:08.780 --> 52:09.780
Literally.

52:09.780 --> 52:10.780
That's literally what's happening.

52:10.780 --> 52:12.780
In batch mode.

52:12.780 --> 52:13.780
Okay.

52:13.780 --> 52:14.780
In batch mode.

52:14.780 --> 52:18.780
Yeah, pretty the poor bastards who have to maintain that code.

52:18.780 --> 52:21.780
Okay, that's a pain.

52:21.780 --> 52:23.780
Not even Fortran, it's COBOL.

52:23.780 --> 52:25.780
It's COBOL.

52:25.780 --> 52:32.780
And banks are still buying mainframes in 2021 and running ancient COBOL code.

52:32.780 --> 52:38.780
And the Federal Reserve is probably even older than what the banks have,

52:38.780 --> 52:41.780
and they have an old COBOL mainframe.

52:41.780 --> 52:48.780
And so the government effectively has editing privileges on the money database.

52:48.780 --> 52:55.780
And they use those editing privileges to make more money whenever they want.

52:55.780 --> 52:59.780
And this increases the error in the database that is money.

52:59.780 --> 53:03.780
So I think money should really be viewed through the lens of information theory.

53:03.780 --> 53:08.780
And so it's kind of like an internet connection.

53:08.780 --> 53:12.780
Like what's the bandwidth, you know, total bitrate?

53:12.780 --> 53:21.780
What is the latency, jitter, packet drop, you know, errors in the network, communication?

53:21.780 --> 53:23.780
Just think of money like that, basically.

53:23.780 --> 53:26.780
I think that's probably the way we think of it.

53:26.780 --> 53:31.780
And then say what system, from an information theory standpoint,

53:31.780 --> 53:34.780
allows an economy to function the best?

53:35.780 --> 53:46.780
And, you know, crypto is an attempt to reduce the error in money

53:46.780 --> 53:52.780
that is contributed by governments diluting the money supply

53:52.780 --> 53:57.780
as basically a pernicious form of taxation.

53:58.780 --> 54:01.780
So both policy in terms of with inflation

54:01.780 --> 54:08.780
and actual technological COBOL cryptocurrency takes us into the 21st century

54:08.780 --> 54:11.780
in terms of the actual systems that allow you to do the transactions,

54:11.780 --> 54:14.780
to store wealth, all those kinds of things.

54:16.780 --> 54:18.780
Like I said, just think of money as information.

54:18.780 --> 54:23.780
People often will think of money as having power in and of itself.

54:23.780 --> 54:24.780
It does not.

54:24.780 --> 54:29.780
Money is information, and it does not have power in and of itself.

54:29.780 --> 54:36.780
Like, you know, again, applying the physics tools of thinking about things in the limit is helpful.

54:36.780 --> 54:45.780
If you are stranded on a tropical island and you have a trillion dollars, it's useless.

54:46.780 --> 54:49.780
Because there's no resource allocation.

54:49.780 --> 54:51.780
Money is a database resource allocation.

54:51.780 --> 54:53.780
But there's no resource to allocate except yourself.

54:53.780 --> 54:55.780
So money is useless.

54:59.780 --> 55:03.780
If you're stranded on a desert island with no food,

55:03.780 --> 55:10.780
all the Bitcoin in the world will not stop you from starving.

55:11.780 --> 55:23.780
So just think of money as a database for resource allocation across time and space.

55:23.780 --> 55:38.780
And then in what form should that database or data system, what would be most effective?

55:38.780 --> 55:44.780
Now, there is a fundamental issue with, say, Bitcoin in its current form,

55:44.780 --> 55:48.780
in that the transaction volume is very limited.

55:50.780 --> 55:59.780
And the latency for a properly confirmed transaction is too long, much longer than you'd like.

55:59.780 --> 56:06.780
So it's actually not great from a transaction volume standpoint or a latency standpoint.

56:08.780 --> 56:17.780
So it is perhaps useful to solve an aspect of the money database problem,

56:17.780 --> 56:24.780
which is this sort of store of wealth or an accounting of relative obligations, I suppose.

56:24.780 --> 56:30.780
But it is not useful as a currency, as a day-to-day currency.

56:30.780 --> 56:32.780
But people have proposed different technological solutions.

56:32.780 --> 56:33.780
Like Lightning.

56:33.780 --> 56:37.780
Yeah, Lightning Network and the Layer 2 technologies on top of that.

56:37.780 --> 56:40.780
I mean, it seems to be all kind of a trade-off.

56:40.780 --> 56:44.780
But the point is, it's kind of brilliant to say that just think about information,

56:44.780 --> 56:48.780
think about what kind of database, what kind of infrastructure enables the exchange of information.

56:48.780 --> 56:50.780
Yeah, say like you're operating an economy,

56:50.780 --> 56:56.780
and you need to have something that allows for the efficient,

56:56.780 --> 57:00.780
to have efficient value ratios between products and services.

57:00.780 --> 57:03.780
So you've got this massive number of products and services,

57:03.780 --> 57:08.780
and you need to, you can't just barter because that would be extremely unwieldy.

57:08.780 --> 57:18.780
So you need something that gives you a ratio of exchange between goods and services.

57:18.780 --> 57:25.780
And then something that allows you to shift obligations across time, like debt,

57:25.780 --> 57:28.780
debt and equity shift obligations across time.

57:28.780 --> 57:30.780
Then what does the best job of that?

57:30.780 --> 57:34.780
Probably the reason why I think there's some merits of Dogecoin,

57:34.780 --> 57:37.780
even though it was obviously created as a joke,

57:37.780 --> 57:45.780
is that it actually does have a much higher transaction volume capability than Bitcoin.

57:45.780 --> 57:53.780
And the cost of doing a transaction, the Dogecoin fee is very low.

57:53.780 --> 57:55.780
Like right now, if you want to do a Bitcoin transaction,

57:55.780 --> 57:57.780
the price of doing that transaction is very high.

57:57.780 --> 58:00.780
So you could not use it effectively for most things.

58:00.780 --> 58:03.780
And nor could it even scale to a high volume.

58:07.780 --> 58:13.780
And when Bitcoin was started, I guess around 2008 or something like that,

58:13.780 --> 58:17.780
the internet connections were much worse than they are today.

58:17.780 --> 58:23.780
Like order of magnitude, I mean, there's way, way worse in 2008.

58:23.780 --> 58:28.780
So like having a small block size or whatever,

58:28.780 --> 58:34.780
and a long synchronization time made sense in 2008.

58:34.780 --> 58:41.780
But 2021, or fast forward 10 years, it's like economically low.

58:41.780 --> 58:49.780
And I think there's some value to having a linear increase in the amount of currency that is generated.

58:49.780 --> 58:56.780
So because some amount of the currency, like if a currency is too deflationary,

58:56.780 --> 59:02.780
or should say if a currency is expected to increase,

59:02.780 --> 59:12.780
if a currency is too deflationary, or should say if a currency is expected to increase in value over time,

59:12.780 --> 59:14.780
there's reluctance to spend it.

59:14.780 --> 59:20.780
Because you're like, oh, I'll just hold it and not spend it because it's scarcity is increasing with time.

59:20.780 --> 59:23.780
So if I spend it now, then I will regret spending it.

59:23.780 --> 59:27.780
So I will just, you know, hodl it.

59:27.780 --> 59:33.780
But if there's some dilution of the currency occurring over time, that's more of an incentive to use it as a currency.

59:33.780 --> 59:49.780
So those coins somewhat randomly has just a fixed number of sort of coins or hash strings that are generated every year.

59:49.780 --> 59:52.780
So there's some inflation, but it's not a percentage base.

59:52.780 --> 59:55.780
It's a fixed number.

59:55.780 --> 01:00:02.780
So the percentage of inflation will necessarily decline over time.

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.780
So I'm not saying that it's like the ideal system for a currency,

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:15.780
but I think it actually is just fundamentally better than anything else I've seen just by accident.

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:19.780
So I like how you said around 2008.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:24.780
So you're not, you know, some people suggested you might be Satoshi Nakamoto.

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:28.780
You've previously said you're not. You're not for sure.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.780
Would you tell us if you were? Yes. OK.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:38.780
Do you think it's a feature or a bug that he's anonymous or she or they?

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.780
It's an interesting kind of quirk of human history that there is a particular technology

01:00:43.780 --> 01:01:03.780
that is a completely anonymous inventor or creator.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:12.780
Well, you can look at the evolution of ideas before the launch of Bitcoin

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:19.780
and see who wrote, you know, about those ideas.

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.780
And then I don't know exactly.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.780
Obviously, I don't know who created Bitcoin for practical purposes,

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.780
but the evolution of ideas is pretty clear before that.

01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:34.780
And it seems as though like Nick Szabo is probably more than anyone else

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.780
responsible for the evolution of those ideas.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:44.780
So he claims not to be Nakamoto, but I'm not sure that's neither here nor there.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:50.780
But he seems to be the one more responsible for the ideas behind Bitcoin than anyone else.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.780
So it's not perhaps like singular figures aren't even as important as the figures

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.780
involved in the evolution of ideas that led to things.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:03.780
So, yeah, you know, most perhaps it's sad to think about history,

01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.780
but maybe most names will be forgotten anyway.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:11.780
What is the name anyway? It's a name attached to an idea.

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.780
What does it even mean really?

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.780
I think Shakespeare had a thing about roses and stuff, whatever he said.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.780
Rose by any other name. It smells sweet.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.780
I got Elon to quote Shakespeare. I feel like I accomplished something today.

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:30.780
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.780
I'm going to clip that out.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:38.780
Not more temperate and more fair.

01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:49.780
Autopilot. Tesla Autopilot has been through an incredible journey over the past six years

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:56.780
or perhaps even longer in the minds of, in your mind, in the minds of many involved.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.780
I think that's where we first like connected really was the autopilot stuff, autonomy and

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.780
the whole journey was incredible to me to watch.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:12.780
I was because I knew, well, part of it was I was at MIT and I knew the difficulty of computer vision.

01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.780
And I knew the whole I had a lot of colleagues and friends about the DARPA challenge.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.780
I knew how difficult it is. And so there was a natural skepticism.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:26.780
When I first drove a Tesla with the initial system based on Mobileye, I thought there's no way.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:35.780
The first one I got in, I thought there's no way this car could maintain like stay in the lane and create a comfortable experience.

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:41.780
So my intuition initially was that the lane keeping problem is way too difficult to solve.

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.780
Oh, thank you. Yeah, that's relatively easy.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:52.780
Well, like, but not this, but solve in the way that we just we talked about previous is prototype versus a thing

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.780
that actually creates a pleasant experience over hundreds of thousands of miles or millions.

01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:01.780
Yeah, so we had to wrap a lot of code around the Mobileye thing.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.780
It doesn't just work by itself.

01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.780
I mean, there's part that's part of the story of how you approach things.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.780
Sometimes sometimes you do things from scratch.

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:13.780
Sometimes at first you kind of see what's out there and then you decide to from scratch.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:20.780
That was one of the boldest decisions I've seen is both on the hardware and the software to decide to eventually go from scratch.

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:26.780
I thought, again, I was skeptical whether that's going to be able to work out because it's such a such a difficult problem.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.780
And so it was an incredible journey.

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:44.780
What I see now with everything, the hardware, the compute, the sensors, the things I maybe care and love about most is the stuff that Andre Karpathy is leading with the data set selection, the whole data engine process, the neural network architectures,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:54.780
the way that's in the real world that network is tested, validated, all the different test sets versus the ImageNet model of computer vision.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:59.780
Like what's in academia is like real world artificial intelligence.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:07.780
Andre is awesome and obviously plays an important role, but we have a lot of really talented people driving things.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:15.780
And Ashok is actually the head of autopilot engineering. Andre is the director of AI.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:21.780
AI stuff. Yeah. So yeah, I'm aware that there's an incredible team of just a lot going on.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:27.780
Yeah, just, you know, people will give me too much credit and they'll give Andre too much credit.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:31.780
And people should realize how much is going on under the.

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.780
Yeah, it's just a lot of really talented people.

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:39.780
The Tesla autopilot AI team is extremely talented.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:42.780
It's like some of the smartest people in the world.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.780
So yeah, we're getting it done.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:53.780
What are some insights you've gained over those five, six years of autopilot about the problem of autonomous driving?

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:59.780
So you leaped in having some sort of first principles kinds of intuitions,

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.780
but nobody knows how difficult the problem is.

01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:08.780
I thought the self-driving problem would be hard, but it was harder than I thought.

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:13.780
It's not like I thought it would be easy. I thought it would be very hard, but it was actually way harder than even that.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:20.780
So what it comes down to at the end of the day is to solve self-driving, you have to solve.

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:27.780
You basically need to recreate what you what humans do to drive,

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:33.780
which is humans drive with optical sensors, eyes and biological neural nets.

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:45.780
And so in order to that, that's how the entire road system is designed to work with with basically passive optical and neural nets biologically.

01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:51.780
And now that we need to. So for actually for full self-driving to work, we have to recreate that in digital form.

01:06:51.780 --> 01:07:02.780
So we have to that that means cameras with advanced neural nets in silicon form.

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:07.780
And then you will obviously solve for full self-driving.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:09.780
That's that's the only way I don't think there's any other way.

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:14.780
But the question is, what aspects of human nature do you have to encode into the machine?

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:17.780
Right. So you have to solve the perception problem, like detect.

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:24.780
And then you first realize what is the perception problem for driving, like all the kinds of things you have to be able to see.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.780
Like, what do we even look at when we drive?

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:32.780
There's I just recently heard Andre talked about at MIT about car doors.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:36.780
I think it was the world's greatest talk of all time about car doors.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.780
You know, the fine details of car doors.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.780
Like, what is even an open car door, man?

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.780
So like the the ontology of that, that's a perception problem.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.780
We humans solve that perception problem and Tesla has to solve that problem.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.780
And then there's the control and the planning coupled with the perception.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:08:01.780
You have to figure out like what's involved in driving, like especially in all the different edge cases.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.780
And then, I mean, maybe you can comment on this.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:12.780
How much game theoretic kind of stuff needs to be involved, you know, at a four way stop sign?

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:17.780
You know, as humans, when we drive, our actions affect the world.

01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:20.780
Like, it changes how others behave.

01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.780
Most of the time was driving.

01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:30.780
You're usually just responding to the scene as opposed to like really asserting yourself in the scene.

01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:31.780
Do you think?

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:38.780
I think these sort of control logic conundrums are not the hard part.

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:49.780
What do you think is the hard part in this whole beautiful complex problem?

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:51.780
So it's a lot of freaking software, man.

01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.780
A lot of smart lines of code.

01:08:53.780 --> 01:09:00.780
For sure, in order to have, create an accurate vector space.

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:11.780
So, like, you're coming from image space, which is like this flow of photons going to the cameras.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:19.780
And then you have this massive boot stream in image space.

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:31.780
And then you have to effectively compress a massive boot stream corresponding to photons

01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:42.780
that knocked off an electron in a camera sensor and turn that boot stream into vector space.

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:52.780
By vector space, I mean like, you know, you've got cars and humans and lane lines and curves

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.780
and traffic lights and that kind of thing.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:06.780
Once you have an accurate vector space, the control problem is similar to that of a video game,

01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:12.780
like a Grand Theft Auto or Cyberpunk, if you have accurate vector space.

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.780
The control problem is, I wouldn't say it's trivial, it's not trivial,

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:24.780
but it's not like some insurmountable thing.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.780
But having accurate vector space is very difficult.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:34.780
Yeah, I think we humans don't give enough respect to how incredible the human perception is.

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:40.780
Mapping the raw photons to the vector space representation in our heads.

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:47.780
Your brain is doing an incredible amount of processing and giving you an image that is a very cleaned up image.

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:51.780
When we look around here, you see color in the corners of your eyes,

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:58.780
but actually your eyes have very few cones, like cone receptors in the peripheral vision.

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:04.780
Your eyes are painting color in the peripheral vision.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.780
You don't realize it, but their eyes are actually painting color.

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:13.780
And your eyes also have like this blood vessels and all sorts of gnarly things and there's a blind spot.

01:11:13.780 --> 01:11:20.780
But do you see your blind spot? No, your brain is painting in the missing, the blind spot.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:26.780
You're going to do these things online where you look here and look at this point and then look at this point

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:32.780
and if it's in your blind spot, your brain will just fill in the missing bits.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.780
The peripheral vision is so cool.

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.780
It makes you realize all the illusions for vision science.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:39.780
It makes you realize just how incredible the brain is.

01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.780
The brain is doing a crazy amount of post-processing on the vision signals from your eyes.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.780
It's insane.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:56.780
And then even once you get all those vision signals, your brain is constantly trying to forget as much as possible.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.780
So human memory is perhaps the weakest thing about the brain is memory.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:08.780
So because memory is so expensive to our brain and so limited, your brain is trying to forget as much as possible

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:15.780
and distill the things that you see into the smallest amounts of information possible.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.780
So your brain is trying to not just get to a vector space,

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:24.780
but get to a vector space that is the smallest possible vector space of only relevant objects.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:30.780
And I think you can sort of look inside your brain, or at least I can,

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:37.780
like when you drive down the road and try to think about what your brain is actually doing consciously.

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:46.780
And it's like you'll see a car because you don't have cameras.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.780
I don't have eyes in the back of your head or the side.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:57.780
So you say like, basically your head is like a, you basically have like two cameras on a slow gimbal.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:01.780
And what's your, and eyesight is not that great.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:06.780
Okay, human eyes are like, and people are constantly distracted and thinking about things and texting

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.780
and doing all sorts of things they shouldn't do in a car, changing the radio station.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:24.780
So having arguments is like, when's the last time you looked right and left and rearward

01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:30.780
or even diagonally forward to actually refresh your vector space?

01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:37.780
So you're glancing around and what your mind is doing is trying to distill the relevant vectors,

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:49.780
basically objects with a position and motion, and then editing that down to the least amount that's necessary for you to drive.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:55.780
It does seem to be able to edit it down or compress it even further into things like concepts.

01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:02.780
So it's not, it's like it goes beyond, the human mind seems to go sometimes beyond vector space to sort of space of concepts

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:06.780
to where you'll see a thing, it's no longer represented spatially somehow.

01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.780
It's almost like a concept that you should be aware of.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:15.780
Like if this is a school zone, you'll remember that as a concept, which is a weird thing to represent.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:19.780
But perhaps for driving, you don't need to fully represent those things.

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:25.780
Or maybe you get those kind of indirectly.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:33.780
You need to establish vector space and then actually have predictions for those vector spaces.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:46.780
So like if you drive past, say, a bus and you see that there's people,

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:54.780
before you drove past the bus, you saw people crossing, or just imagine there's like a large truck or something blocking sight.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:15:00.780
But before you came up to the truck, you saw that there were some kids about to cross the road in front of the truck.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:05.780
Now you can no longer see the kids, but you need to be able, but you would now know,

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:11.780
okay, those kids are probably going to pass by the truck and cross the road, even though you cannot see them.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:18.780
So you have to have memory, you have to need to remember that there were kids there

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:23.780
and you need to have some forward prediction of what their position will be.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:24.780
It's a really hard problem.

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.780
At the time of relevance.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.780
So with occlusions and computer vision, when you can't see an object anymore,

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:36.780
even when it just walks behind a tree and reappears, that's a really, really, I mean, at least in academic literature,

01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:40.780
it's tracking through occlusions. It's very difficult.

01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:41.780
Yeah, we're doing it.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:42.780
I understand this.

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:43.780
Yeah.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:44.780
So some of it-

01:15:44.780 --> 01:15:45.780
It's like object permanence.

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.780
Like same thing happens with the humans with neural nets.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:55.780
When a toddler grows up, there's a point in time where they develop, they have a sense of object permanence.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:01.780
So before a certain age, if you have a ball or a toy or whatever, and you put it behind your back and you pop it out,

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.780
if they don't, before they have object permanence, it's like a new thing every time.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.780
It's like, whoa, this toy went, poof, disappeared, and now it's back again and they can't believe it.

01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:13.780
And that they can play peekaboo all day long because peekaboo is fresh every time.

01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.780
But then we figure out object permanence, then they realize, oh, no, the object is not gone.

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:21.780
It's just behind your back.

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:25.780
Sometimes I wish we never did figure out object permanence.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.780
Yeah, so that's-

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:30.780
That's an important problem to solve.

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:42.780
Yes, so an important evolution of the neural nets in the car is memory across both time and space.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:48.780
So now you can't remember, like you have to say, how long do you want to remember things for?

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.780
And there's a cost to remembering things for a long time.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:57.780
So you run out of memory to try to remember too much for too long.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:02.780
And then you also have things that are stale if you remember them for too long.

01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.780
And then you also need things that are remembered over time.

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:13.780
So even if you, say, have, for our good sake, five seconds of memory on a time basis.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.780
But let's say you're parked at a light and you saw, use a pedestrian example,

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:26.780
that people were waiting to cross the road and you can't quite see them because of an occlusion.

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:31.780
But they might wait for a minute before the light changes for them to cross the road.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:38.780
You still need to remember that that's where they were and that they're probably going to cross the road type of thing.

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:45.780
So even if that exceeds your time-based memory, it should not exceed your space memory.

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:48.780
And I just think the data engine side of that,

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:54.780
so getting the data to learn all of the concepts that you're saying now is an incredible process.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:59.780
It's this iterative process of just this hydronet of many...

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.780
Hydronet.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.780
We're changing the name to something else.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.780
Okay. I'm sure it'll be equally as Rick and Morty-like.

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.780
There's a lot of... Yeah.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:16.780
We've re-architected the neural net in the cars so many times, it's crazy.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:23.780
Oh, so every time there's a new major version, you'll rename it to something more ridiculous or memorable and beautiful?

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.780
Sorry. Not ridiculous, of course.

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:34.780
If you see the full array of neural nets that are operating in the cars, it kind of boggles the mind.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:38.780
There's so many layers, it's crazy.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.780
So, yeah.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:56.780
And we started off with simple neural nets that were basically image recognition on a single frame from a single camera

01:18:56.780 --> 01:19:03.780
and then trying to knit those together with C.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:09.780
I should say we're really primarily running C here because C++ is too much overhead.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:11.780
And we have our own C compiler.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:19.780
So to get maximum performance, we actually wrote our own C compiler and are continuing to optimize our C compiler for maximum efficiency.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:26.780
In fact, we've just recently done a new rev on our C compiler that will compile directly to our autopilot hardware.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.780
So you want to compile the whole thing down with your own compiler?

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:30.780
Yeah.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.780
So efficiency here, because there's all kinds of compute.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:34.780
There's CPU, GPU.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.780
There's basic types of things.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:39.780
And you have to somehow figure out the scheduling across all of those things.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.780
And so you're compiling the code down.

01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:42.780
Yeah.

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780
Okay.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.780
So that's why there's a lot of people involved.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:53.780
There's a lot of hardcore software engineering at a very sort of bare metal level.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:20:02.780
Because we're trying to do a lot of compute that's constrained to our full self-driving computer.

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:14.780
And we want to try to have the highest frames per second possible with a very finite amount of compute and power.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:21.780
So we really put a lot of effort into the efficiency of our compute.

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:34.780
And so there's actually a lot of work done by some very talented software engineers at Tesla that at a very foundational level to improve the efficiency of compute

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:46.780
and how we use the trip accelerators, which are basically doing matrix math dot products, like a bazillion dot products.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.780
It's like, what are neural nets?

01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:53.780
It's like, compute-wise, like 99% dot products.

01:20:56.780 --> 01:21:00.780
And you want to achieve as many high frame rates like a video game.

01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:04.780
You want full resolution, high frame rate.

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:09.780
High frame rate, low latency, low judder.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:26.780
So I think one of the things we're moving towards now is no post-processing of the image through the image signal processor.

01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:39.780
So what happens for cameras is that there's a lot of post-processing done in order to make pictures look pretty.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:42.780
And so we don't care about pictures looking pretty.

01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:44.780
We just want the data.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.780
So we're moving just raw photon counts.

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:58.780
So the image that the computer sees is actually much more than what you'd see if you represented it on a camera.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:00.780
It's got much more data.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:08.780
And even in very low light conditions, you can see that there's a small photon count difference between this spot here and that spot there,

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:16.780
which means that it can see in the dark incredibly well because it can detect these tiny differences in photon counts.

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:19.780
That's much better than you could possibly imagine.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:26.780
And then we also save 13 milliseconds on latency.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.780
From removing the post-processing in the image?

01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780
Yes.

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:41.780
It's like because we've got eight cameras and then there's roughly, I don't know, one and a half milliseconds or so,

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.780
maybe 1.6 milliseconds of latency for each camera.

01:22:45.780 --> 01:23:00.780
And so going to just basically bypassing the image processor gets us back 13 milliseconds of latency, which is important.

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:13.780
And we track latency all the way from photon hits the camera to all the steps that it's got to go through to get it to go through the various neural nets and the C code.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.780
And there's a little bit of C++ there as well.

01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:23.780
Well, maybe a lot, but the core stuff is the heavy duty computers all in C.

01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:37.780
And so we track that latency all the way to an output command to the drive unit to accelerate the brakes just to slow down the steering, turn left or right.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.780
So because you go to output a command, that's going to go to a controller.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.780
And some of these controllers have an update frequency that's maybe 10 hertz or something like that, which is slow.

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.780
That's like now you lose 100 milliseconds potentially.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:24:02.780
So then we want to update the drivers on the steering and braking control to have more like 100 hertz instead of 10 hertz.

01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:05.780
And you get a 10 millisecond latency instead of 100 milliseconds, worst case latency.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:11.780
And actually jitter is more of a challenge than latency, because latency is like you can anticipate and predict.

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:21.780
But if you've got a stack up of things going from the camera to the computer through then a series of other computers and finally to an actuator on the car,

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:29.780
if you have a stack up of tolerances, of timing tolerances, then you can have quite a variable latency, which is called jitter.

01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:36.780
And that makes it hard to anticipate exactly how you should turn the car or accelerate,

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:44.780
because if you've got maybe 150, 200 milliseconds of jitter, then you could be off by up to 0.2 seconds.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.780
And this could make a big difference.

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:56.780
So you have to interpolate somehow to deal with the effects of jitter so that you can make robust control decisions.

01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:04.780
So the jitter is in the sensor information, or the jitter can occur at any stage in the pipeline?

01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:17.780
If you have fixed latency, you can anticipate and say, OK, we know that our information is, for argument's sake, 150 milliseconds stale.

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:30.780
So for argument's sake, 150 milliseconds from photon second camera to where you can measure a change in the acceleration of the vehicle.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:43.780
So then you can say, OK, well, we know it's 150 milliseconds, so we're going to take that into account and compensate for that latency.

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:51.780
However, if you've got then 150 milliseconds of latency plus 100 milliseconds of jitter, which could be anywhere from 0 to 100 milliseconds on top,

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.780
so then your latency could be from 150, 250 milliseconds.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.780
Now you've got 100 milliseconds that you don't know what to do with, and that's basically random.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:03.780
So getting rid of jitter is extremely important.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:06.780
And that affects your control decisions and all those kinds of things.

01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.780
OK.

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.780
Yeah, the car is just going to fundamentally maneuver better with lower jitter.

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.780
Got it.

01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:18.780
The cars will maneuver with superhuman ability and reaction time much faster than a human.

01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:35.780
I mean, I think over time, autopilot, full self-driving will be capable of maneuvers that are far more than what James Bond could do in the best movie type of thing.

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:38.780
That's exactly what I was imagining in my mind, as you said.

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.780
It's like an impossible maneuver that a human couldn't do.

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:54.780
Well, let me ask, looking back the six years, looking out into the future, based on your current understanding, how hard do you think this full self-driving problem,

01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.780
when do you think Tesla will solve level four FSD?

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:04.780
I mean, it's looking quite likely that it will be next year.

01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.780
And what does the solution look like?

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.780
Is it the current pool of FSD beta candidates?

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:15.780
They start getting greater and greater as there have been degrees of autonomy.

01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:20.780
And then there's a certain level beyond which they can do their own.

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.780
They can read a book.

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:36.780
Yeah, so you can see that anybody who's been following the full self-driving beta closely will see that the rate of disengagement has been dropping rapidly.

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:44.780
So a disengagement would be where the driver intervenes to prevent the car from doing something dangerous potentially.

01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:55.780
So the interventions per million miles has been dropping dramatically at some point.

01:27:55.780 --> 01:28:12.780
And that trend looks like it happens next year is that the probability of an accident on FSD is less than that of the average human and then significantly less than that of the average human.

01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:19.780
So it certainly appears like we will get there next year.

01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:27.780
Then, of course, then there's going to be a case of, OK, well, we now have to prove this to regulators and prove it to, you know,

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:33.780
and we want a standard that is not just equivalent to a human, but much better than the average human.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:41.780
I think it's got to be at least two or three times higher safety than a human, so two or three times lower probability of injury than a human.

01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:46.780
Before we would actually say like, OK, it's OK to go, it's not going to be a cool, it's going to be much better.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:57.780
So if you look at FSD 10.6 just came out recently, 10.7 is on the way, maybe 11 is on the way somewhere in the future.

01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:08.780
Yeah, we were hoping to get 11 out this year, but 11 actually has a whole bunch of fundamental rewrites on the neural net architecture

01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:15.780
and some fundamental improvements in creating vector space.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:22.780
So there is some fundamental leap that really deserves the 11.

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:24.780
I mean, that's a pretty cool number.

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:31.780
Yeah, 11 would be a single stack for all, one stack to rule them all.

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:46.780
But there are just some really fundamental neural net architecture changes that will allow for much more capability,

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.780
but at first they're going to have issues.

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:54.780
So like we have this working on like sort of alpha software and it's good,

01:29:54.780 --> 01:30:05.780
but it's basically taking a whole bunch of C, C++ code and deleting a massive amount of C++ code and replacing it with the neural net.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:11.780
And Andre makes this point a lot, which is like neural nets are kind of eating software.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:17.780
Over time, there's like less and less conventional software, more and more neural net, which is still software,

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:29.780
but it's still comes out the lines of software, but more neural net stuff and less heuristics basically.

01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:39.780
More matrix based stuff and less heuristics based stuff.

01:30:39.780 --> 01:31:03.780
And, you know, like one of the big changes will be like right now the neural nets will deliver a giant bag of points to the C++ or C and C++ code.

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:06.780
We call it the giant bag of points.

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:12.780
And it's like, so you've got a pixel and something associated with that pixel.

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:14.780
Like this pixel is probably car.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:16.780
This pixel is probably lane line.

01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:23.780
Then you've got to assemble this giant bag of points in the C code and turn it into vectors.

01:31:23.780 --> 01:31:47.780
And it does a pretty good job of it, but we want to just, we need another layer of neural nets on top of that to take the giant bag of points and distill that down to vector space in the neural net part of the software as opposed to the heuristics part of the software.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:49.780
This is a big improvement.

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.780
Neural nets all the way down is what you want.

01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:57.780
It's not even all neural nets, but this will be just a game.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:11.780
This is a game changer to not have the bag of points, the giant bag of points that has to be assembled with many lines of C, C++ and have the neural net just assemble those into a vector.

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:18.780
So the neural net is outputting much, much less data.

01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:21.780
It's outputting, this is a lane line.

01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:22.780
This is a curb.

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:23.780
This is drivable space.

01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:24.780
This is a car.

01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:28.780
This is a pedestrian or cyclist or something like that.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:57.780
It's really outputting proper vectors to the C, C++ control code as opposed to the sort of constructing the vectors in C, which we've done, I think, quite a good job of, but we're kind of hitting a local maximum on how well the C can do this.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.780
So this is really a big deal.

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:05.780
And just all of the networks in the car need to move to surround video.

01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:09.780
There's still some legacy networks that are not surround video.

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:17.780
And all of the training needs to move to surround video and the efficiency of the training needs to get better, and it is.

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:34.780
And then we need to move everything to raw photon accounts as opposed to processed images, which is quite a big reset on the training because the system's trained on post-processed images.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:43.780
So we need to redo all the training to train against the raw photon accounts instead of the post-processed image.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:46.780
So ultimately, it's kind of reducing the complexity of the whole thing.

01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:51.780
So reducing, reducing lines of code will actually go lower.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:53.780
Yeah, that's fascinating.

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:59.780
So you're doing fusion of all the sensors and reducing the complexity of having to deal with these cameras as cameras really.

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.780
Right. Yes.

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.780
Same with humans.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:06.780
I guess we got yours too.

01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:15.780
Okay. Yeah, well, we'll actually need to incorporate sound as well because you need to listen for ambulance sirens or firetrucks.

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:20.780
You know, if somebody like, you know, yelling at you or something.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:24.780
There's a little bit of audio that needs to be incorporated as well.

01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:25.780
Do you need to go grab a break?

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.780
Yeah, sure. Let's take a break.

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:34.780
Honestly, frankly, like the ideas are the easy thing and the implementation is the hard thing.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:38.780
Like the idea of going to the moon is the easy part, but going to the moon is the hard part.

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:39.780
It's the hard part.

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:45.780
And there's a lot of like hardcore engineering that's got to get done at the hardware and software level.

01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:54.780
Like optimizing the C compiler and just, you know, cutting out latency everywhere.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:58.780
Like this is, if we don't do this, the system will not work properly.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:08.780
So the work of the engineers doing this, they are like the unsung heroes, you know, but they are critical to the success of the situation.

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:09.780
I think you made it clear.

01:35:09.780 --> 01:35:10.780
I mean, at least to me, it's super exciting.

01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:14.780
Everything that's going on outside of what Andre is doing.

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.780
Yeah. Just the whole infrastructure, the software.

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.780
I mean, everything is going on with data engine, whatever, whatever it's called.

01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.780
The whole process is just work of art to me.

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:26.780
I think the sheer scale of it is boggles mind.

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:34.780
Like the training, the amount of work done with, like we've written all this custom software for training and labeling and to do auto labeling.

01:35:34.780 --> 01:35:47.780
Auto labeling is essential because especially when you've got like surround video, it's very difficult to like label surround video from scratch is extremely difficult.

01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:54.780
Like take a human's such a long time to even label one video clip, like several hours or the auto label it.

01:35:54.780 --> 01:36:08.780
Basically, we just apply like heavy duty, like a lot of compute to the to the video clips to pre assign and guess what all the things are that are going on in the surround video.

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:09.780
And then there's like correcting it.

01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.780
Yeah.

01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:15.780
And then all the human has to do is like tweet, like say, you know, just what is incorrect.

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:20.780
This is like increase increases productivity by effect a hundred or more.

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:21.780
Yeah.

01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.780
So you've presented Tesla bot as primarily useful in the factory.

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:29.780
First of all, I think humanoid robots are incredible from a fan of robotics.

01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:37.780
I think the elegance of movement that human the human robots that bipedal robots show are just so cool.

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:44.780
So it's really interesting that you're working on this and also talking about applying the same kind of all the ideas of some of which you've talked about with data.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:52.780
All the things that we're talking about with Tesla autopilot, just transferring that over to the just yet another robotics problem.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.780
I have to ask, since I care about human robot interaction, so the human side of that.

01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:59.780
So you've talked about mostly in the factory.

01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.780
Do you see it?

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:08.780
Do you see part of this problem that Tesla bot has to solve as interacting with humans and potentially having a place like in the home?

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:12.780
So interacting, not just not replacing labor, but also like.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:13.780
I don't know.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:16.780
Well, I think a friend or an assistant.

01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.780
Yeah, I think the possibilities are endless.

01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:39.780
Yeah, it's it's obviously like a it's not quite in Tesla's primary mission direction of accelerating sustainable energy, but it is a an extremely useful thing that we can do for the world, which is to make a useful humanoid robot.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:46.780
That is capable of interacting with the world and helping in in many different ways.

01:37:46.780 --> 01:38:01.780
So so in factories and really just just I mean, I think if you say, like, extrapolate to, you know, many years in the future, it's like, I think work will become optional.

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:16.780
So, like, there's a lot of jobs that if you if you weren't paid to do it, they wouldn't do it like it's not it's not fun, you know, necessarily, like if you're washing dishes all day, it's like, you know, even if you really like washing dishes, you really want to do it for eight hours a day every day.

01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:17.780
Probably not.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:25.780
And then there's like dangerous work and basically if it's dangerous boring, it has like potential for repetitive stress injury, that kind of thing.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:31.780
Then that's really where humanoid robots would add the most value initially.

01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:41.780
So that's what we're aiming for is is to for the human robots to do jobs that people don't voluntarily want to do.

01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:47.780
And then we'll have to pair that obviously with some kind of universal basic income in the future.

01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:52.780
So, I think.

01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:57.780
Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far into the future, but I guess that there may be something like that.

01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:01.780
So, can I ask a wild question?

01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:04.780
So, the answer is yes.

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:07.780
I think that's a good question.

01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:15.780
Yeah, I haven't really thought about it that far into the future, but I guess that there may be something like that.

01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.780
So, can I ask a wild question?

01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:24.780
So, the number of Tesla cars has been accelerating.

01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:27.780
It's been close to two million produced.

01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:29.780
Many of them have autopilot.

01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:31.780
I think we're over two million now.

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:39.780
Do you think there will ever be a time when there will be more Tesla bots than Tesla cars?

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:46.780
Yeah, actually, it's funny you asked this question because normally I do try to think pretty far into the future,

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:54.780
but I haven't really thought that far into the future with the Tesla bot or it's codenamed Optimus.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.780
I call it Optimus subprime.

01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:03.780
It's not like a giant transformer robot.

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:09.780
So, it's meant to be a general purpose helpful bot.

01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:25.780
And basically, like Tesla, I think has the most advanced real-world AI for interacting with the real world,

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:29.780
which it develops as a function to make self-driving work.

01:40:29.780 --> 01:40:38.780
And so, along with custom hardware and like a lot of hardcore low-level software to have it run efficiently

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:45.780
and be power efficient because it's one thing to do neural nets if you've got a gigantic server room with 10,000 computers.

01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:52.780
But now, let's say you have to now distill that down into one computer that's running at low power in a humanoid robot or a car.

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:53.780
That's actually very difficult.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:58.780
A lot of hardcore software work is required for that.

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:07.780
So, since we're kind of like solving the navigate the real world with neural nets problem for cars,

01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.780
which are kind of like robots with four wheels,

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:19.780
then it's like kind of a natural extension of that is to put it in a robot with arms and legs and actuators.

01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:34.780
So, like the two hard things are like you basically need to have the robot be intelligent enough to interact in a sensible way with the environment.

01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:44.780
So, you need real-world AI and you need to be very good at manufacturing, which is a very hard problem.

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:48.780
Tesla is very good at manufacturing and also has the real-world AI.

01:41:48.780 --> 01:42:03.780
So, making the humanoid robot work is basically means developing custom motors and sensors that are different from what a car would use.

01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:14.780
But we're also, I think we have the best expertise in developing advanced electric motors and power electronics.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:21.780
So, it just has to be for humanoid robot application of a car.

01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:24.780
Still, you do talk about love sometimes.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.780
So, let me ask, this isn't like for like sex robots or something like that.

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:29.780
Love is the answer.

01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:30.780
Yes.

01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:41.780
There is something compelling to us, not compelling, but we connect with humanoid robots or even legged robots like with the dog in shapes of dogs.

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:46.780
It seems like there's a huge amount of loneliness in this world.

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:51.780
All of us seek companionship with other humans, friendship and all those kinds of things.

01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:54.780
We have a lot here in Austin, a lot of people have dogs.

01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:08.780
There seems to be a huge opportunity to also have robots that decrease the amount of loneliness in the world or help us humans connect with each other.

01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:10.780
So, in a way that dogs can.

01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:20.780
Do you think about that with Teslabot at all or is it really focused on the problem of performing specific tasks, not connecting with humans?

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:31.780
To be honest, I have not actually thought about it from the companionship standpoint, but I think it could be actually a very good companion.

01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:43.780
You develop a personality over time that is unique.

01:43:43.780 --> 01:44:00.780
It's not like they're just all the robots are the same and that personality could evolve to match the owner or whatever you want to call it.

01:44:00.780 --> 01:44:05.780
The other half in the same way that friends do.

01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:08.780
See, I think that's a huge opportunity.

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:22.780
That's interesting because there's a Japanese phrase like wabi-sabi, the subtle imperfections are what makes something special.

01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:33.780
And the subtle imperfections of the personality of the robot mapped to the subtle imperfections of the robot's human friend.

01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:41.780
I don't know, owner sounds like maybe the wrong word, but could actually make an incredible buddy, basically.

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.780
In that way, the imperfections.

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.780
Like R2D2 or like a C3PO sort of thing.

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:53.780
So, from a machine learning perspective, I think the flaws being a feature is really nice.

01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:59.780
You could be quite terrible at being a robot for quite a while in the general home environment or in the general world.

01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:01.780
And that's kind of adorable.

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:05.780
And that's like those are your flaws and you fall in love with those flaws.

01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:10.780
So, it's very different than autonomous driving where it's a very high stakes environment.

01:45:10.780 --> 01:45:12.780
You cannot mess up.

01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:16.780
So, it's more fun to be a robot in the home.

01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:26.780
In fact, if you think of like C3PO and R2D2, they actually had a lot of flaws and imperfections and silly things and they would argue with each other.

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.780
Were they actually good at doing anything?

01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:32.780
I'm not exactly sure.

01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.780
They definitely added a lot to the story.

01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:44.780
But there's sort of quirky elements that they would make mistakes and do things.

01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:50.780
It made them relatable, I don't know, enduring.

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:56.780
So, yeah, I think that could be something that probably would happen.

01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:00.780
But our initial focus is just to make it useful.

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.780
So, I'm confident we'll get it done.

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:13.780
I'm not sure what the exact time frame is, but we'll probably have, I don't know, a decent prototype towards the end of next year or something like that.

01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:17.780
And it's cool that it's connected to Tesla, the car.

01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:34.780
Yeah, it's using a lot of, you know, it would use the autopilot inference computer and a lot of the training that we've done for cars in terms of recognizing real world things could be applied directly to the robot.

01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:40.780
But there's a lot of custom actuators and sensors that need to be developed.

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:45.780
And an extra module on top of the vector space for love.

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:48.780
That's amazing.

01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.780
Okay.

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:51.780
We can add that to the car, too.

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:53.780
That's true.

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:55.780
That could be useful in all environments.

01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:59.780
Like you said, a lot of people argue in the car, so maybe we can help them out.

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:04.780
You're a student of history, fan of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:05.780
Yeah, that's great.

01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:06.780
Greatest podcast ever.

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.780
Yeah, I think it is, actually.

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:12.780
It almost doesn't really count as a podcast.

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:15.780
Yeah, it's more like an audio book.

01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:19.780
So you were on the podcast with Dan, I just had a chat with him about it.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.780
He said you guys want military and all that kind of stuff.

01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:30.780
Yeah, it was basically, it should be titled Engineer Wars.

01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:40.780
Essentially, when there's a rapid change in the rate of technology, then engineering plays a pivotal role in victory and battle.

01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:43.780
How far back in history did you go?

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:45.780
Did you go World War II?

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:53.780
Well, it was supposed to be a deep dive on fighters and bomber technology in World War II.

01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.780
But that ended up being more wide ranging than that.

01:47:56.780 --> 01:48:03.780
Because I just went down the total rattle of studying all of the fighters and bombers in World War II.

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:13.780
And the constant rock-paper-scissors game that one country would make this plane, then it would make a plane to beat that, and the other country would make a plane to beat that.

01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:23.780
And really what matters is the pace of innovation and also access to high quality fuel and raw materials.

01:48:23.780 --> 01:48:30.780
So Germany had some amazing designs, but they couldn't make them because they couldn't get the raw materials.

01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:36.780
And they had a real problem with the oil and fuel, basically.

01:48:36.780 --> 01:48:39.780
The fuel quality was extremely variable.

01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:41.780
So the design wasn't the bottleneck?

01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:46.780
Yeah, the US had kick-ass fuel that was very consistent.

01:48:46.780 --> 01:49:04.780
The problem is if you make a very high-performance aircraft engine, in order to make it high-performance, the fuel, the aviation gas, has to be a consistent mixture, and it has to have a high octane.

01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:12.780
High octane is the most important thing, but it also can't have impurities and stuff because you'll foul up the engine.

01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:15.780
And Germany just never had good access to oil.

01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:19.780
They tried to get it by invading the Caucasus, but that didn't work too well.

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:22.780
That never works well.

01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:26.780
Nice to meet you.

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:39.780
So Germany was always struggling with basically shitty oil, and then they couldn't count on high-quality fuel for their aircraft, so then they had to have all these additives and stuff.

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:46.780
Whereas the US had awesome fuel, and that provided that to Britain as well.

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:55.780
So that allowed the British and the Americans to design aircraft engines that were super high-performance, better than anything else in the world.

01:49:55.780 --> 01:50:00.780
Germany could design the engines, they just didn't have the fuel.

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:06.780
And then also the quality of the aluminum alloys that they were getting was also not that great.

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:10.780
Did you talk about all this with Dan?

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.780
Yep.

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.780
Awesome.

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:23.780
Broadly looking at history, when you look at Genghis Khan, when you look at Stalin, Hitler, the darkest moments of human history, what do you take away from those moments?

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:32.780
Does it help you gain insight about human nature, about human behavior today, whether it's the wars or the individuals or just the behavior of people, any aspects of history?

01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:42.780
Yeah, I find history fascinating.

01:50:42.780 --> 01:51:04.780
There's just a lot of incredible things that have been done, good and bad, that they help you understand the nature of civilization and individuals.

01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:08.780
Does it make you sad that humans do these kinds of things to each other?

01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:18.780
You look at the 20th century, World War II, the cruelty, the abuse of power, talk about communism, Marxism and Stalin.

01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:23.780
There's a lot of human history.

01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:27.780
Most of it is actually people just getting on with their lives.

01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:34.780
It's not like human history is just nonstop war and disaster.

01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:38.780
Those are actually just intermittent and rare.

01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:42.780
If they weren't, then humans would soon cease to exist.

01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:55.780
Wars tend to be written about a lot, whereas a normal year where nothing major happened doesn't get written about much.

01:51:55.780 --> 01:52:03.780
Most people just like farming and living their life, being a villager somewhere.

01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:08.780
Every now and again, there's a war.

01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:25.780
There aren't very many books where I just had to stop reading because it was just too dark.

01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:31.780
The book about Stalin, The Court of the Red Tsar, I had to stop reading.

01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:36.780
It was just too dark, rough.

01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:40.780
Yeah, the 30s.

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:49.780
There's a lot of lessons there to me, in particular that it feels like humans, like all of us have that.

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:55.780
It's the old Solzhenitsyn line, that the line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man.

01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:58.780
That all of us are capable of evil, all of us are capable of good.

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:06.780
It's almost like this kind of responsibility that all of us have to tend towards the good.

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:15.780
To me, looking at history, it's almost like an example of, look, you have some charismatic leader that convinces you of things.

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:22.780
It's too easy, based on that story, to do evil onto each other, onto your family, onto others.

01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.780
It's our responsibility to do good.

01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:29.780
It's not like now is somehow different from history.

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:31.780
That can happen again, all of it can happen again.

01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:34.780
And yes, most of the time, you're right.

01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:38.780
I mean, the optimistic view here is mostly people are just living life.

01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:44.780
And as you've often memed about, the quality of life was way worse back in the day,

01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:47.780
and it keeps improving over time through innovation, through technology.

01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:53.780
But still, it's somehow notable that these blimps of atrocities happen.

01:53:53.780 --> 01:53:54.780
Sure.

01:53:54.780 --> 01:54:00.780
Yeah, I mean, life was really tough for most of history.

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:10.780
I mean, for most of human history, a good year would be one where not that many people in your village died of the plague,

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:14.780
starvation, freezing to death, or being killed by a neighboring village.

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:16.780
It's like, well, it wasn't that bad.

01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:19.780
It was only like, we lost 5% this year.

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:21.780
That was a good year.

01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:22.780
It was a good year.

01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.780
That would be par for the course.

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:30.780
Just not starving to death would have been the primary goal of most people throughout history,

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:35.780
is making sure we'll have enough food to last through the winter and not freeze or whatever.

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:41.780
Now food is plentiful.

01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:43.780
I have an obesity problem.

01:54:44.780 --> 01:54:51.780
Well, yeah, the lesson there is to be grateful for the way things are now for some of us.

01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.780
We've spoken about this offline.

01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:58.780
I'd love to get your thought about it here.

01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:05.780
If I sat down for a long-form in-person conversation with the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin,

01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:12.780
would you potentially want to call in for a few minutes to join in on a conversation with him,

01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.780
moderated and translated by me?

01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:15.780
Sure, yeah.

01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:17.780
Sure, I'd be happy to do that.

01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.780
You've shown interest in the Russian language.

01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:27.780
Is this grounded in your interest in history of linguistics, culture, general curiosity?

01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:29.780
I think it sounds cool.

01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:30.780
Sounds cool.

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.780
Now it looks cool.

01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:37.780
Well, it takes a moment to read Cyrillic.

01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:46.780
Once you know what the Cyrillic characters stand for, actually then reading Russian becomes a lot easier

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:50.780
because there are a lot of words that are actually the same, like bank is bank.

01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:59.780
So find the words that are exactly the same and now you start to understand Cyrillic.

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:05.780
If you can sound it out, there's at least some commonality of words.

01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:08.780
What about the culture?

01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:11.780
You love great engineering, physics.

01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:13.780
There's a tradition of the sciences there.

01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:14.780
Sure.

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.780
You look at the 20th century from rocketry.

01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:23.780
Some of the greatest rockets, some of the space exploration has been done in the former Soviet Union.

01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:29.780
So do you draw inspiration from that history, just how this culture that in many ways,

01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:36.780
one of the sad things is because of the language, a lot of it is lost to history because it's not translated,

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:40.780
because it is in some ways an isolated culture.

01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:43.780
It flourishes within its borders.

01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:50.780
Do you draw inspiration from those folks, from the history of science engineering there?

01:56:50.780 --> 01:57:01.780
The Soviet Union, Russia, and Ukraine as well have a really strong history in space flight.

01:57:01.780 --> 01:57:09.780
Some of the most advanced and impressive things in history were done by the Soviet Union.

01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:19.780
So one cannot help but admire the impressive rocket technology that was developed.

01:57:19.780 --> 01:57:28.780
After the fall of the Soviet Union, there's much less that happened.

01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:38.780
But still things are happening, but it's not quite at the frenetic pace that was happening

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:45.780
before the Soviet Union dissolved into separate republics.

01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:52.780
Yeah, I mean, there's Roscosmos, the Russian agency.

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:57.780
I look forward to a time when those countries with China are working together,

01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:01.780
the United States are all working together, maybe a little bit of friendly competition.

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.780
I think friendly competition is good.

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:10.780
Governments are slow and the only thing slower than one government is a collection of governments.

01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:16.780
So the Olympics would be boring if everyone just crossed the finishing line at the same time.

01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:18.780
Nobody would watch.

01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:21.780
And people wouldn't try hard to run fast and stuff.

01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:25.780
So I think friendly competition is a good thing.

01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:28.780
This is also a good place to give a shout out to a video titled

01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:33.780
The Entire Soviet Rocket Engine Family Tree by Tim Dodd, aka Everyday Astronaut.

01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:37.780
It's like an hour and a half. It gives a full history of Soviet rockets.

01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:40.780
And people should definitely go check on and support Tim in general.

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:45.780
That guy is super excited about the future, super excited about spaceflight.

01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:50.780
Every time I see anything by him, I just have a stupid smile on my face because he's so excited about stuff.

01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:51.780
I love people like that.

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:55.780
Tim Dodd is really great if you're interested in anything to do with space.

01:58:55.780 --> 01:59:01.780
In terms of explaining rocket technology to your average person, he's awesome.

01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:04.780
The best, I'd say.

01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:10.780
And I should say probably the reason I switched us from...

01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:13.780
Like Raptor at one point was going to be a hydrogen engine.

01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:17.780
But hydrogen has a lot of challenges. It's very low density.

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:22.780
It's a deep cryogen, so it's only liquid at a very close to absolute zero.

01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:24.780
It requires a lot of insulation.

01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:28.780
So there's a lot of challenges there.

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:35.780
And I was actually reading a bit about Russian rocket engine developments.

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:49.780
And at least the impression I had was that the Soviet Union, Russia, and Ukraine primarily were actually in the process of switching to Methalox.

01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:54.780
And there were some interesting test data for ISP.

01:59:54.780 --> 02:00:00.780
They were able to get up to a 380 second ISP with a Methalox engine.

02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:04.780
And I was like, well, okay, that's actually really impressive.

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:13.780
So I think you could actually get a much lower cost.

02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:23.780
In optimizing cost per ton to orbit, cost per ton to Mars, I think methane oxygen is the way to go.

02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:31.780
And I was partly inspired by the Russian work on the test stands with Methalox engines.

02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:34.780
And now for something completely different.

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:40.780
Do you mind doing a bit of a meme review in the spirit of the great, the powerful PewDiePie?

02:00:40.780 --> 02:00:44.780
Let's say 1 to 11. Just go over a few documents, print it out.

02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:45.780
We can try.

02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.780
Let's try this.

02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:53.780
I present to you document number uno.

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:58.780
Okay.

02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:03.780
Vladimir Payler discovers marshmallows.

02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.780
That's not bad.

02:01:06.780 --> 02:01:11.780
So you get it because he likes to pail things?

02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:14.780
Yes, I get it. I know three, whatever.

02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:19.780
That's not very good.

02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:28.780
This is grounded in some engineering, some history.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:31.780
Yeah, give us an 8 out of 10.

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.780
What do you think about nuclear power?

02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.780
I'm in favor of nuclear power.

02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:41.780
I think it's in a place that is not subject to extreme natural disasters.

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:47.780
I think nuclear power is a great way to generate electricity.

02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:51.780
I don't think we should be shutting down nuclear power stations.

02:01:51.780 --> 02:01:53.780
Yeah, but what about Chernobyl?

02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:56.780
Exactly.

02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:03.780
So I think people, there's a lot of fear of radiation and stuff.

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:08.780
I guess the problem is a lot of people just don't understand,

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:12.780
they don't study engineering or physics.

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:15.780
Just the word radiation just sounds scary.

02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:20.780
They can't calibrate what radiation means.

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:26.780
But radiation is much less dangerous than you think.

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:40.780
So for example, when the Fukushima problem happened due to the tsunami,

02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:46.780
I got people in California asking me if they should worry about radiation from Fukushima.

02:02:46.780 --> 02:02:50.780
I'm like, definitely not, not even slightly, not at all.

02:02:50.780 --> 02:02:53.780
That is crazy.

02:02:53.780 --> 02:03:05.780
And just to show, this is how the danger is so much overplayed compared to what it really is,

02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:14.780
that I actually flew to Fukushima and I donated a solar power system for a water treatment plant.

02:03:14.780 --> 02:03:25.780
And I made a point of eating locally grown vegetables on TV in Fukushima.

02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:30.780
I'm still alive.

02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:35.780
It's not even that the risk of these events is low, but the impact of them is...

02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:37.780
The impact is greatly exaggerated.

02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.780
It's human nature.

02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:41.780
People don't know what radiation is.

02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:45.780
I've had people ask me, what about radiation from cell phones causing brain cancer?

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:49.780
I'm like, when you say radiation, do you mean photons or particles?

02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:51.780
I don't know what you mean by photons or particles.

02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:58.780
Do you mean, let's say photons, what frequency or wavelength?

02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:01.780
And they're like, no, I have no idea.

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:04.780
Do you know that everything's radiating all the time?

02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.780
What do you mean?

02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.780
Yeah, everything's radiating all the time.

02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:12.780
The photons are being emitted by all objects all the time, basically.

02:04:12.780 --> 02:04:21.780
And if you want to know what it means to stand in front of nuclear fire, go outside.

02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:26.780
The sun is a gigantic thermonuclear reactor.

02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:28.780
You're staring right at it.

02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:29.780
Are you still alive?

02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:30.780
Yes.

02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:32.780
Okay, amazing.

02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:39.780
I guess radiation is one of the words that could be used as a tool to fear monger by certain people.

02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:40.780
That's it.

02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:42.780
I think people just don't understand.

02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:46.780
That's the way to fight that fear, I suppose, is to understand, is to learn.

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:50.780
Yeah, to say like, okay, how many people have actually died from nuclear accidents?

02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:52.780
It's like practically nothing.

02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:57.780
And say how many people have died from coal plants?

02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:59.780
And it's a very big number.

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:04.780
Obviously, we should not be starting up coal plants and shutting down nuclear plants.

02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:07.780
It just doesn't make any sense at all.

02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:14.780
Coal plants, like, I don't know, 100 to 1,000 times worse for health than nuclear power plants.

02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:16.780
You want to go to the next one?

02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:19.780
It's really bad.

02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:23.780
It's 90, 180, and 360 degrees.

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:24.780
Everybody loves the math.

02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.780
Nobody gives a shit about 270.

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:29.780
It's not super funny.

02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:31.780
I don't know, like, 203.

02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:36.780
This is not, you know, LOL situation.

02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:38.780
Yeah.

02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:43.780
That's pretty good.

02:05:43.780 --> 02:05:47.780
The United States oscillating between establishing and destroying dictatorships.

02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:49.780
It's like a metric. Is that a metric?

02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:53.780
Yeah, it's a 7 out of 10. It's kind of true.

02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:56.780
Oh, yeah, this is kind of personal for me.

02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:58.780
Next one.

02:05:58.780 --> 02:05:59.780
Oh, man, is this Laika?

02:05:59.780 --> 02:06:01.780
Yeah, well, no, this is-

02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:03.780
Or it's like referring to Laika or something?

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:06.780
As Laika's, like, husband.

02:06:06.780 --> 02:06:07.780
Husband, yeah, yeah.

02:06:07.780 --> 02:06:10.780
Hello, yes, this is dog. Your wife was launched into space.

02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:15.780
And then the last one is him with his eyes closed in a bottle of vodka.

02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.780
Yeah, Laika didn't come back.

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.780
No.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:24.780
They don't tell you the full story of, you know, what the impact they had on the loved ones.

02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:25.780
True.

02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:26.780
This gets an 11 for me.

02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:27.780
Sure.

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:28.780
The Soviet shadow.

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:32.780
Oh, yeah, this keeps going on the Russian theme.

02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:36.780
First man in space, nobody cares, first man on the moon.

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:37.780
Well, I think people do care.

02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.780
I know, but-

02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:45.780
Yuriy Gagarin's names will be forever in history, I think.

02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:52.780
There is something special about placing, like, stepping foot onto another totally foreign land.

02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:56.780
It's not the journey, like, people that explore the oceans.

02:06:56.780 --> 02:07:02.780
It's not as important to explore the oceans as to land on a whole new continent.

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:03.780
Yeah.

02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:05.780
Oh, this is about you.

02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:07.780
Oh, yeah, I'd love to get your comment on this.

02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:17.780
Elon Musk, after sending $6.6 billion to the UN to end world hunger, you have three hours.

02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.780
You know, I mean, obviously, $6 billion is not going to end world hunger.

02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:31.780
So, I mean, the reality is, at this point, the world is producing far more food than it can really consume.

02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.780
Like, we don't have a caloric constraint to this point.

02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:44.780
So, where there is hunger, it is almost always due to, like, civil war or strife or some like.

02:07:44.780 --> 02:07:52.780
It's not a thing that is extremely rare for it to be just a matter of, like, lack of money.

02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:57.780
It's like, you know, it's like some, there's a civil war in some country,

02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:02.780
and, like, one part of the country is literally trying to starve the other part of the country.

02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:05.780
So, it's much more complex than something that money could solve.

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:09.780
It's geopolitics, it's a lot of things.

02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:13.780
It's human nature, it's governments, it's monies, monetary systems, all that kind of stuff.

02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:16.780
Yeah, food is extremely cheap these days.

02:08:16.780 --> 02:08:27.780
It's like, I mean, the US at this point, you know, among low-income families, obesity is actually not a problem.

02:08:27.780 --> 02:08:30.780
It's not, like, obesity, it's not hunger.

02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:33.780
It's like too much, you know, too many calories.

02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:37.780
So, it's not that nobody's hungry anywhere.

02:08:37.780 --> 02:08:43.780
It's just, this is not a simple matter of adding money and solving it.

02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:47.780
What do you think that one gets?

02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.780
Just kidding.

02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:51.780
Two.

02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:54.780
Just going after empires.

02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:56.780
World, where did you get those artifacts?

02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:58.780
The British Museum.

02:08:58.780 --> 02:09:01.780
A shout out to Monty Python, we found them.

02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:05.780
Yeah, the British Museum is pretty great.

02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:10.780
I mean, admittedly, Britain did take these historical artifacts from all around the world and put them in London.

02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:15.780
But, you know, it's not like people can't go see them.

02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:24.780
So, it is a convenient place to see these ancient artifacts is London for, you know, for a large segment of the world.

02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:30.780
So, I think, you know, on balance, the British Museum is a net good, although I'm sure that a lot of countries argue about that.

02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:32.780
Yeah.

02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:36.780
It's like you want to make these historical artifacts accessible to as many people as possible.

02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:40.780
And the British Museum, I think, does a good job of that.

02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:51.780
Even if there's a darker aspect to, like, the history of empire in general, whatever the empire is, however things were done, it is the history that happened.

02:09:51.780 --> 02:09:53.780
You can't sort of erase that history, unfortunately.

02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:55.780
You could just become better in the future.

02:09:55.780 --> 02:09:57.780
That's the point.

02:09:57.780 --> 02:09:58.780
Yeah.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:03.780
I mean, it's like, well, how are we going to pass moral judgment on these things?

02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:17.780
Like, it's like, you know, if one is going to judge, say, the British Empire, you've got to judge, you know, what everyone was doing at the time and how were the British relative to everyone?

02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:30.780
And I think the British would actually get, like, a relatively good grade, relatively good grade, not in absolute terms, but compared to what everyone else was doing, they were not the worst.

02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:37.780
Like I said, you've got to look at these things in the context of the history at the time and say, what were the alternatives and what are you comparing it against?

02:10:37.780 --> 02:10:38.780
Yes.

02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:48.780
And I do not think it would be the case that Britain would get a bad grade when looking at history at the time.

02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:58.780
Now, if you judge history from, you know, from what is morally acceptable today, you're basically going to give everyone a failing grade.

02:10:58.780 --> 02:10:59.780
I'm not clear.

02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:07.780
I don't think anyone would get a passing grade in their morality of, like, you go back 300 years ago, like, who's getting a passing grade?

02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:09.780
Basically no one.

02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:16.780
And we might not get a passing grade from generations that come after us.

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:19.780
What does that one get?

02:11:19.780 --> 02:11:21.780
Sure, six, seven.

02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:23.780
For the Monty Python, maybe.

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.780
I always love Monty Python.

02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:25.780
They're great.

02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:28.780
The life of Brian and the quest of the Holy Grail are incredible.

02:11:28.780 --> 02:11:29.780
Yeah, yeah.

02:11:29.780 --> 02:11:31.780
Damn, those serious eyebrows.

02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:33.780
Brazhnev.

02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:37.780
How important do you think is facial hair to great leadership?

02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:38.780
Well-

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:39.780
You've got a new haircut.

02:11:39.780 --> 02:11:42.780
How does that affect your leadership?

02:11:42.780 --> 02:11:43.780
I don't know.

02:11:43.780 --> 02:11:44.780
Hopefully not.

02:11:44.780 --> 02:11:45.780
It doesn't.

02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:47.780
Is that the second no one?

02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:49.780
Yeah, the second is no one.

02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:52.780
There is no one competing with Brazhnev.

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:53.780
No one, too.

02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:55.780
Those are, like, epic eyebrows.

02:11:59.780 --> 02:12:00.780
That's ridiculous.

02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:01.780
Give it a six or seven.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:02.780
I don't know.

02:12:02.780 --> 02:12:05.780
I like this Shakespearean analysis of names.

02:12:05.780 --> 02:12:09.780
Brazhnev had a flair for drama as well.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:11.780
Like, you know, showmanship.

02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:12.780
Yeah, yeah.

02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:14.780
It must come from the eyebrows.

02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:15.780
All right.

02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:16.780
Invention.

02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:17.780
Great engineering.

02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:19.780
Look what I invented.

02:12:19.780 --> 02:12:21.780
That's the best thing since ripped up bread.

02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.780
Yeah.

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:25.780
I invented sliced bread.

02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:29.780
Am I just explaining memes at this point?

02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:33.780
This is what my life has become.

02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:35.780
He's a meme or a meme explainer.

02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:43.780
I'm a meme, like a scribe that runs around with the kings and just writes down memes.

02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:45.780
I mean, when was the cheeseburger invented?

02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:48.780
That's, like, an epic invention.

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:50.780
Like, wow.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:52.780
Versus just, like, a burger?

02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:53.780
Or a burger.

02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:54.780
I guess a burger in general.

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:56.780
It's, like, you know.

02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:58.780
Then there's, like, what is a burger?

02:12:58.780 --> 02:12:59.780
What's a sandwich?

02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.780
And then you start getting, is a pizza a sandwich?

02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:02.780
And what is the original?

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:05.780
It gets into an ontology argument.

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:08.780
Yeah, but everybody knows, like, if you order, like, a burger or a cheeseburger or whatever

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:11.780
and you, like, you get, like, you know, tomato and some lettuce and onions and whatever

02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:14.780
and, you know, mayo and ketchup and mustard.

02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:15.780
It's, like, epic.

02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:19.780
Yeah, but I'm sure they've had bread and meat separately for a long time.

02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:23.780
And it was kind of a burger on the same plate, but somebody who actually combined them into

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:28.780
the same thing and then could bite it and hold it makes it convenient.

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:29.780
It's a materials problem.

02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:30.780
Yeah.

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:32.780
Like, your hands don't get dirty and whatever.

02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:38.780
Yeah, it's brilliant.

02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:40.780
That is not what I would have guessed.

02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:43.780
But everyone knows, like, if you order a cheeseburger, you know what you're getting.

02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:48.780
You know, it's not like some obtuse, like, I wonder what I'll get, you know.

02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:52.780
You know, fries are, I mean, great.

02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:55.780
I mean, they were the devil, but fries are awesome.

02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:00.780
And yeah, pizza is incredible.

02:14:00.780 --> 02:14:02.780
Food innovation doesn't get enough love.

02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:03.780
Yeah.

02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:05.780
I guess is what we're getting at.

02:14:05.780 --> 02:14:07.780
Great.

02:14:07.780 --> 02:14:11.780
What about the Matthew McConaughey Austinite here?

02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:14.780
President Kennedy, do you know how to put men on the moon yet?

02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:15.780
NASA, no.

02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:19.780
President Kennedy would be a lot cooler if you did.

02:14:19.780 --> 02:14:20.780
Pretty much.

02:14:20.780 --> 02:14:21.780
Sure.

02:14:21.780 --> 02:14:25.780
Six, six or seven, I suppose.

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:27.780
And this is the last one.

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:29.780
That's funny.

02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:34.780
Someone drew a bunch of dicks all over the walls, Sistine Chapel, Boy's Bathroom.

02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:36.780
Sure, I'll give it a nine.

02:14:36.780 --> 02:14:38.780
It's really true.

02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:39.780
All right.

02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.780
This is our highest ranking meme for today.

02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:42.780
I mean, it's true.

02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:44.780
Like, how do they get away with that?

02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:45.780
Lots of nakedness.

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:49.780
I mean, dick pics are, I mean, just something throughout history.

02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:52.780
As long as people can draw things, there's been a dick pic.

02:14:52.780 --> 02:14:54.780
It's a staple of human history.

02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:55.780
It's a staple.

02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.780
It's just throughout human history.

02:14:57.780 --> 02:14:59.780
You tweeted that you aspire to comedy.

02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:01.780
You're friends with Joe Rogan.

02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:05.780
Might you do a short standup comedy set at some point in the future?

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:08.780
Maybe Open for Joe, something like that.

02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:09.780
Is that...

02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.780
Really?

02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.780
Standup?

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:12.780
Full-on standup?

02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:13.780
Full-on standup.

02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:14.780
Is that in there or is that...

02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:16.780
I've never thought about that.

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:23.780
It's extremely difficult if at least that's what Joe says and the comedians say.

02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:24.780
Huh.

02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:26.780
I wonder if I could.

02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.780
There's only one way to find out.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:34.780
You know, I have done standup for friends just impromptu.

02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:40.780
You know, I'll get on like a roof and they do laugh, but they're our friends too.

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:46.780
So I don't know if you've got to call, you know, like a room of strangers, are they going to actually also find it funny?

02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:50.780
But I could try, see what happens.

02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.780
I think you'd learn something either way.

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:53.780
Yeah.

02:15:53.780 --> 02:16:00.780
I kind of love both when you bomb and when you do great, just watching people, how they deal with it.

02:16:00.780 --> 02:16:02.780
It's so difficult.

02:16:02.780 --> 02:16:05.780
You're so fragile up there.

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:07.780
It's just you.

02:16:07.780 --> 02:16:14.780
And you think you're going to be funny and when it completely falls flat, it's just, it's beautiful to see people deal with like that.

02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:17.780
I might have enough material to do standup.

02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:22.780
I've never thought about it, but I might have enough material.

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:24.780
I don't know, like 15 minutes or something.

02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:25.780
Oh, yeah.

02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:26.780
Yeah.

02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:27.780
Do a Netflix special.

02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:31.780
Netflix special, sure.

02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:34.780
What's your favorite Rick and Morty concept?

02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:35.780
Just to spring that on you.

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:39.780
Is there, there's a lot of sort of scientific engineering ideas explored there.

02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:42.780
There's the, there's the butter robot.

02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.780
That's great.

02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:44.780
That's a great show.

02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:45.780
You like it?

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:46.780
Yeah, Rick and Morty's awesome.

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:50.780
Somebody that's exactly like you from an alternate dimension showed up there.

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:51.780
Elon Tusk.

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:52.780
Yeah, that's right.

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:53.780
That you voiced.

02:16:53.780 --> 02:16:54.780
Yeah.

02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:57.780
Rick and Morty certainly explores a lot of interesting concepts.

02:16:58.780 --> 02:16:59.780
Should I like, what's the favorite one?

02:16:59.780 --> 02:17:00.780
I don't know.

02:17:00.780 --> 02:17:04.780
The butter robot certainly is, you know, it's like, it's certainly possible to have too

02:17:04.780 --> 02:17:06.780
much sentience in a device.

02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:11.780
Like, you don't want to have your toaster be like a super genius toaster.

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:14.780
It's going to hate, hate life because all it could do is make his toast.

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:19.780
But if it's like, you don't want to have like super intelligence stuck in a very limited

02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:20.780
device.

02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:24.780
Do you think it's too easy from a, if we're talking about from the engineering perspective

02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:30.780
of super intelligence, like with Marvin, the robot, like is it, it seems like it might

02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:33.780
be very easy to engineer just a depressed robot.

02:17:33.780 --> 02:17:40.780
Like it, it's not obvious to engineer a robot that's going to find a fulfilling existence.

02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:42.780
Same as humans, I suppose.

02:17:42.780 --> 02:17:46.780
But I wonder if that's like the default.

02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:51.780
If you don't do a good job on building a robot, it's going to be sad a lot.

02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:57.780
Well, we can reprogram robots easier than we can reprogram humans.

02:17:57.780 --> 02:18:04.780
So I guess if you let it evolve without tinkering, then it might get sad.

02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:12.780
But you can change the optimization function and have it be a cheery robot.

02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:17.780
You, like I mentioned with SpaceX, you give a lot of people hope and a lot of people look

02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:19.780
up to you, millions of people look up to you.

02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:26.780
If we think about young people in high school, maybe in college, what advice would you give

02:18:26.780 --> 02:18:31.780
to them about if they want to try to do something big in this world, they want to really have

02:18:31.780 --> 02:18:32.780
a big positive impact.

02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:38.780
What advice would you give them about their career, maybe about life in general?

02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:41.780
Try to be useful.

02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:45.780
You do things that are useful to your fellow human beings, to the world.

02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:50.780
It's very hard to be useful.

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:53.780
Very hard.

02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:59.780
Are you contributing more than you consume?

02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:07.780
Try to have a positive net contribution to society.

02:19:07.780 --> 02:19:13.780
I think that's the thing to aim for, not to try to be a leader for the sake of being a

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:16.780
leader or whatever.

02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:22.780
A lot of the time, the people you want as leaders are the people who don't want to be

02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:28.780
leaders.

02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:38.780
If you can live a useful life, that is a good life, a life worth having lived.

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:46.780
I would encourage people to use the mental tools of physics and apply them broadly in

02:19:46.780 --> 02:19:47.780
life.

02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:49.780
They are the best tools.

02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:53.780
When you think about education and self-education, what do you recommend?

02:19:53.780 --> 02:20:02.780
There's the university, there's self-study, there is hands-on finding a company or a place

02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:07.780
or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining them as early as

02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:08.780
possible.

02:20:08.780 --> 02:20:12.780
There's taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry.

02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:17.780
Which trajectory do you suggest?

02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:23.780
In terms of learning about how you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have the

02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:31.780
most positive impact.

02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:36.780
I would encourage people to read a lot of books.

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:45.780
Basically, try to ingest as much information as you can and try to also just develop a good

02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:47.780
general knowledge.

02:20:47.780 --> 02:20:53.780
So you at least have a rough lay of the land of the knowledge landscape.

02:20:53.780 --> 02:20:57.780
Try to learn a little bit about a lot of things.

02:20:57.780 --> 02:21:03.780
How would you know what you're really interested in if you at least aren't doing a peripheral

02:21:03.780 --> 02:21:11.780
exploration broadly of the knowledge landscape?

02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:17.780
Talk to people from different walks of life and different industries and professions and

02:21:17.780 --> 02:21:19.780
skills and occupations.

02:21:19.780 --> 02:21:26.780
Just try to learn as much as possible.

02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:30.780
And search for meaning.

02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:34.780
Isn't the whole thing a search for meaning?

02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:36.780
Yeah, what's the meaning of life and all.

02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:41.780
But just generally, like I said, I would encourage people to read broadly in many different

02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:50.780
subject areas and then try to find something where there's an overlap of your talents and

02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:51.780
what you're interested in.

02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:55.780
So people may be good at something or they may have skill at a particular thing, but they

02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:56.780
don't like doing it.

02:21:56.780 --> 02:22:05.780
So you want to try to find a thing that's a good combination of the things that you're

02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:11.780
inherently good at, but you also like doing.

02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:16.780
And reading is a super fast shortcut to figure out where are you.

02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:21.780
You're both good at it, you like doing it, and it will actually have positive impact.

02:22:21.780 --> 02:22:23.780
Well, you've got to learn about things somehow.

02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:29.780
So reading, a broad range, just really read it.

02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:34.780
You know, the more important one is that kit I read through the encyclopedia.

02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:37.780
So that's pretty helpful.

02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:41.780
And there are all sorts of things I didn't even know existed.

02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:42.780
Well, a lot, obviously.

02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:44.780
It's like as broad as it gets.

02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:50.780
Encyclopedias were digestible, I think, you know, whatever, 40 years ago.

02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:57.780
So, you know, maybe read through the condensed version of the encyclopedia Britannica.

02:22:57.780 --> 02:22:58.780
I'd recommend that.

02:22:58.780 --> 02:23:03.780
You can always like skip subjects where you read a few paragraphs and you know you're

02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:05.780
not interested, just jump to the next one.

02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:13.780
So read the encyclopedia or skim through it.

02:23:14.780 --> 02:23:21.780
And, you know, I put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts

02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:25.780
in an honest day's work to do useful things.

02:23:25.780 --> 02:23:34.780
And just generally to have like not a zero-sum mindset or like have more of a grow the pie

02:23:34.780 --> 02:23:35.780
mindset.

02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:43.780
If you sort of say like when we see people like perhaps including some very smart people

02:23:43.780 --> 02:23:50.780
kind of taking an attitude of like doing things that seem like morally questionable, it's

02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:56.780
often because they have at a base sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum mindset.

02:23:56.780 --> 02:24:02.780
And they, without realizing it, they don't realize they have a zero-sum mindset or at

02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:04.780
least they don't realize it consciously.

02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:08.780
And so if you have a zero-sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things

02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:09.780
from others.

02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:17.780
If the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie.

02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:19.780
But this is false.

02:24:19.780 --> 02:24:22.780
Like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie.

02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:33.780
So in reality you can have, overuse this analogy, you can have a lot of pie.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.780
Pie is not fixed.

02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:43.780
So you really want to make sure you're not operating without realizing it from a zero-sum

02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:47.780
mindset where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others.

02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:51.780
Then that's going to result in you trying to take things from others, which is not good.

02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:56.780
It's much better to work on adding to the economic pie.

02:24:56.780 --> 02:25:06.780
So creating more than you consume, doing more than you, yeah.

02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:08.780
So that's a big deal.

02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:16.780
I think there's a fair number of people in finance that do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset.

02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:18.780
I mean, it's all walks of life.

02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:19.780
I've seen that.

02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:25.780
One of the reasons Rogan inspires me is he celebrates others a lot.

02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:28.780
This is not creating a constant competition.

02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:30.780
Like there's a scarcity of resources.

02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:35.780
What happens when you celebrate others and you promote others, the ideas of others,

02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:38.780
it actually grows that pie.

02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:43.780
I mean, the resources become less scarce.

02:25:43.780 --> 02:25:46.780
And that applies in a lot of kinds of domains.

02:25:46.780 --> 02:25:51.780
It applies in academia where a lot of people see some funding for academic research as

02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:52.780
zero-sum.

02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:53.780
It is not.

02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:58.780
If you celebrate each other, if you get everybody to be excited about AI, about physics, about

02:25:58.780 --> 02:26:03.780
mathematics, I think there'll be more and more funding, and I think everybody wins.

02:26:03.780 --> 02:26:06.780
Yeah, that applies, I think, broadly.

02:26:06.780 --> 02:26:08.780
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:13.780
So last question about love and meaning.

02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:18.780
What is the role of love in the human condition broadly and more specific to you?

02:26:18.780 --> 02:26:26.780
How has love, romantic love, or otherwise made you a better person, a better human being?

02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:28.780
Better engineer?

02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:33.780
Now you're asking really perplexing questions.

02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:36.780
It's hard to give a...

02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:42.780
I mean, there are many books, poems, and songs written about what is love and what is...

02:26:42.780 --> 02:26:47.780
What exactly, you know, what is love?

02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:51.780
Maybe you don't hurt me.

02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:53.780
That's one of the great ones, yes.

02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:54.780
Yeah.

02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:57.780
You've early recorded Shakespeare, but that's really up there.

02:26:57.780 --> 02:26:58.780
Yeah.

02:26:58.780 --> 02:27:02.780
Love is a many-splendored thing.

02:27:03.780 --> 02:27:05.780
I mean, there's...

02:27:05.780 --> 02:27:08.780
Because we've talked about so many inspiring things like be useful in the world, sort of

02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:14.780
like solve problems, alleviate suffering, but it seems like connection between humans

02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:20.780
is a source, you know, it's a source of joy, it's a source of meaning, and that's what

02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:23.780
love is, friendship, love.

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:28.780
I just wonder if you think about that kind of thing when you talk about preserving the

02:27:28.780 --> 02:27:34.780
light of human consciousness and us becoming a multi-planetary species.

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:43.780
I mean, to me at least, that means like if we're just alone and conscious and intelligent,

02:27:43.780 --> 02:27:48.780
it doesn't mean nearly as much as if we're with others, right?

02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:51.780
And there's some magic created when we're together.

02:27:51.780 --> 02:27:57.780
The friendship of it, and I think the highest form of it is love, which I think broadly

02:27:57.780 --> 02:28:04.780
is much bigger than just sort of romantic, but also yes, romantic love and family and

02:28:04.780 --> 02:28:05.780
those kinds of things.

02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:10.780
Well, I mean, the reason I guess I care about us becoming multi-planet species and a space-faring

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:17.780
civilization is foundationally, I love humanity.

02:28:17.780 --> 02:28:25.780
And so I wish to see it prosper and do great things and be happy.

02:28:25.780 --> 02:28:30.780
And if I did not love humanity, I would not care about these things.

02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:34.780
So when you look at the whole of it, the human history, all the people who's ever lived,

02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:40.780
all the people alive now, it's pretty, we're okay.

02:28:40.780 --> 02:28:44.780
On the whole, we're a pretty interesting bunch.

02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:47.780
Yeah, all things considered.

02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:53.780
And I've read a lot of history, including the darkest, worst parts of it, and despite

02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:58.780
all that, I think on balance, I still love humanity.

02:28:58.780 --> 02:29:01.780
You joked about it with the 42.

02:29:01.780 --> 02:29:04.780
What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:08.780
Is there a non-numerical representation?

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:12.780
Yeah, really, I think what Douglas Adams was saying in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

02:29:12.780 --> 02:29:17.780
is that the universe is the answer.

02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:23.780
And what we really need to figure out are what questions to ask about the answer that

02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:27.780
is the universe, and that the question is really the hard part.

02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:33.780
And if you can properly frame the question, then the answer, relatively speaking, is easy.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:40.780
So therefore, if you want to understand what questions to ask about the universe, you won't

02:29:40.780 --> 02:29:41.780
understand the meaning of life.

02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:46.780
We need to expand the scope and scale of consciousness so that we're better able to

02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:51.780
understand the nature of the universe and understand the meaning of life.

02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:56.780
And ultimately, the most important part would be to ask the right question.

02:29:56.780 --> 02:29:58.780
Yes.

02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:01.780
Thereby elevating the role of the interviewer.

02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:02.780
Yes, exactly.

02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:05.780
As the most important human in the room.

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:11.780
Good questions are, you know, it's hard to come up with good questions.

02:30:11.780 --> 02:30:13.780
Absolutely.

02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:20.780
But yeah, it's like that is the foundation of my philosophy is that I am curious about

02:30:20.780 --> 02:30:28.780
the nature of the universe and, you know, and obviously I will die, I don't know when

02:30:28.780 --> 02:30:31.780
I'll die, but I won't live forever.

02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:35.780
But I would like to know that we are on a path to understanding the nature of the universe

02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:40.780
and the meaning of life and what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe.

02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:45.780
And so if we expand the scope and scale of humanity and consciousness in general, which

02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:52.780
includes silicon consciousness, then, you know, that seems like a fundamentally good

02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:53.780
thing.

02:30:53.780 --> 02:31:00.780
Elon, like I said, I'm deeply grateful that you would spend your extremely valuable time

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:06.780
with me today and also that you have given millions of people hope in this difficult

02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:10.780
time, this divisive time and this cynical time.

02:31:10.780 --> 02:31:13.780
So I hope you do continue doing what you're doing.

02:31:13.780 --> 02:31:15.780
Thank you so much for talking to me.

02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:16.780
You're welcome.

02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:18.780
Thanks for your excellent questions.

02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:22.780
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Elon Musk to support this podcast.

02:31:22.780 --> 02:31:24.780
Please check out our sponsors in the description.

02:31:24.780 --> 02:31:28.780
And now let me leave you with some words from Elon Musk himself.

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:35.780
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:38.780
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
