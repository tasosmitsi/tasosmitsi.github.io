00:00.000 --> 00:04.460
I think that some people are deliberately trying to completely clear the cultural landscape

00:04.460 --> 00:10.200
of our past in order to say there's nothing good, nothing you can hold on to, no one you

00:10.200 --> 00:14.640
should revere, you've got no heroes, the whole thing comes down, who's left standing?

00:14.640 --> 00:18.920
Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism.

00:18.920 --> 00:26.040
And no, no, you will not have the entire landscape deracinated.

00:26.040 --> 00:31.320
And then the worst ideas tried again.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.480
The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray, author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender,

00:36.480 --> 00:42.440
Race, and Identity, and his most recent book, The War in the West, How to Prevail in the

00:42.440 --> 00:44.840
Age of Unreason.

00:44.840 --> 00:51.200
He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker who points out and pushes back against

00:51.200 --> 00:54.840
what he sees as the madness of our modern world.

00:55.320 --> 01:01.360
I should note that the use of the word Marxism and the West in this conversation refers primarily

01:01.360 --> 01:07.560
to cultural Marxism and the cultural values of Western civilization, respectively.

01:07.560 --> 01:14.000
This is in contrast to my previous conversation with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism

01:14.000 --> 01:19.920
as primarily a critique of capitalism, and thus looking at it through the lens of economics

01:19.920 --> 01:21.560
and not culture.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.840
Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite of each other with very different perspectives

01:26.840 --> 01:30.560
on how we build a flourishing civilization together.

01:30.560 --> 01:38.160
I leave it to you, the listener, to think and to decide which is the better way.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.080
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.560
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:43.560 --> 01:48.040
And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.

01:48.040 --> 01:54.360
You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West, which in part says that the values,

01:54.360 --> 01:57.520
ideas, and history of Western civilization are under attack.

01:57.520 --> 02:00.240
So let's start with the basics.

02:00.240 --> 02:05.160
Historically and today, what are the ideas that represent Western civilization?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.920
The good, the bad, the ugly.

02:06.920 --> 02:11.520
I actually don't get stuck on definitions precisely because, as you know, once you get

02:11.520 --> 02:16.680
stuck on definitions, there's a possibility you'll never get off them.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.880
I'd say a few things.

02:18.440 --> 02:26.480
Obviously, the Western tradition is a specific tradition of ideas, culture, well known to

02:26.480 --> 02:31.800
be perhaps easily defined by the combination of Athens and Jerusalem, the world of the

02:31.800 --> 02:37.120
Bible, and the world of ancient Greece and indeed Rome.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.120
It effectively creates European civilization, which itself spawns the rest of the Western

02:43.120 --> 02:48.840
civilizations, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and others.

02:48.840 --> 02:53.000
But these are the main countries that we still refer to as the West.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.520
So there's a specific tradition and all the things that come from it.

02:58.520 --> 03:05.320
My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say, you know when you're not in it.

03:05.320 --> 03:10.880
So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai, you know you're not in the West, somewhere

03:10.880 --> 03:12.960
else, you know you're not in the West.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.880
When you're in Tokyo, somewhere extraordinary, but you know you're not in the West.

03:17.880 --> 03:26.000
Obviously, there are, let's say, borderline questions like, is Russia in the West?

03:26.000 --> 03:32.440
Which I sort of leave open as a question, possibly.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.520
If you were placed into Moscow blindfolded and you woke up and you couldn't hear the

03:37.520 --> 03:41.200
language or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like, would you guess you

03:41.200 --> 03:42.920
were in the West or not?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.400
I think I was somewhere near it.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
Getting closer.

03:45.400 --> 03:51.280
I mean, you know, Tolstoy asks the question, doesn't he, whether it's European?

03:51.280 --> 03:57.520
And I think the answer to that is not really, although massively influenced by Europe, but

03:57.520 --> 04:03.080
and times wanting to reach towards it, at times wanting to stay away, but a part of

04:03.080 --> 04:07.480
the West, possibly, yes.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.680
But anyway, it's a very specific tradition.

04:10.680 --> 04:16.880
It's one of a number of major traditions in the world and because it's hard to define

04:16.880 --> 04:19.440
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.320
Are there certain characteristics and qualities about the values and the ideas that define

04:23.320 --> 04:24.320
it?

04:24.320 --> 04:28.000
Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Yes.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.080
I mean, the rule of law, properly owning democracies and much more.

04:34.080 --> 04:38.840
I mean, these are, of course, things that ended up being developed in America and then

04:38.880 --> 04:42.960
given back to much of the rest of the West.

04:42.960 --> 04:49.480
I'd say there are other perhaps more controversial attributes I would give to the West.

04:49.480 --> 04:54.400
One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which is not shared, of course,

04:54.400 --> 04:57.160
by every other culture.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.940
The late philosopher George Steiner said he could never get out of his head the haunting

05:01.940 --> 05:06.240
fact that the boats only seemed to go out from Europe.

05:07.160 --> 05:14.520
The explorers, the scholars, the linguists, the people who wanted to discover other civilizations

05:14.520 --> 05:19.000
and indeed even resurrect ancient civilizations and lost civilizations.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.080
These were scholars that were always coming from the West to discover this elsewhere.

05:22.080 --> 05:28.200
By contrast, there were never boats coming from Egypt to help the Anglo-Saxons discover

05:28.200 --> 05:30.560
the origins of their language and so on.

05:30.560 --> 05:34.400
So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which can be said

05:34.400 --> 05:38.840
to be a Western attribute, although it, of course, also has, one should immediately

05:38.840 --> 05:43.240
preface it, some downsides and many criticisms that can be made as some of the consequences

05:43.240 --> 05:50.640
of that interest because, of course, it's not entirely lacking in self-interest.

05:50.640 --> 05:57.640
So it's not just the scholars, it's also the armies, and they're looking to gain access

05:57.720 --> 06:04.720
and control over resources elsewhere and hence the imperial imperative to conquer, to expand.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.280
Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.720
No civilization, I think, that we know of doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors

06:15.720 --> 06:17.280
where it can.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.720
The Western ability to go further, faster certainly gave an advantage in that regard.

06:23.720 --> 06:28.800
Do some civilizations get a bit more excited by that kind of idea than others?

06:28.800 --> 06:29.800
Possible.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.800
It's possible.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.280
Because you could say it's the Western civilization because the technological innovation was more

06:36.280 --> 06:42.280
efficient, doing that kind of thing, but maybe you wanted it more, too.

06:42.280 --> 06:47.760
Well, the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot and did terribly well for many centuries,

06:47.760 --> 06:52.760
and one shouldn't forget that, as did others.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.960
I'd also say, by the way, and again, it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing

06:56.960 --> 07:05.000
out that I think self-criticism is an important attribute of the Western mind, one that, as

07:05.000 --> 07:08.040
you know, is not common everywhere.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.080
Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics to become rich.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.000
So you know, criticism is a negative sounding word.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.800
It could be self-introspection, self-analysis, self-reflection.

07:20.800 --> 07:26.520
And it can be what you need, you know, and in the Western system, I'd argue that one

07:26.520 --> 07:31.920
of the advantages of the system of representative governance is that where there are problems

07:31.920 --> 07:38.640
in the system, you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.920
We listen to arguments, most famously in America in the late 20th century, the civil rights

07:43.920 --> 07:49.360
movement achieved its aims by force of moral argument and persuaded the rest of the country

07:49.440 --> 07:52.160
that it had been wrong.

07:52.160 --> 07:56.040
That's not common in every society by any means.

07:56.040 --> 08:02.320
So I think there are certain attributes of the Western mind that you could say are, they're

08:02.320 --> 08:06.680
not entirely unique, but they are not as commonplace elsewhere.

08:06.680 --> 08:15.200
What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry of power, most visible, most drastic

08:15.200 --> 08:17.120
in the form of slavery, for example?

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery, so I don't regard it as being a unique Western

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
sin.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.920
It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history that didn't have slavery of some

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
kind.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.840
One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day is that people seem to imagine

08:33.840 --> 08:38.080
that our societies in the West were the only ones who ever engaged in any vices.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.080
Alas, this isn't true.

08:40.080 --> 08:45.640
It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake, or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau,

08:45.640 --> 08:49.960
that everybody else in the world was born into sort of Edenic innocence, and only we

08:49.960 --> 08:56.240
in the West had this sort of evil in us that caused us to do bad things to other people.

08:56.240 --> 09:00.600
Slavery was engaging by everyone in the ancient world, of course, and through most of the

09:00.600 --> 09:01.600
modern world as well.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.960
Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today, so it's clearly not something

09:05.960 --> 09:10.040
that the species as a whole has a problem with.

09:10.040 --> 09:14.200
That's more slaves, of course, than there were in the 19th century.

09:14.200 --> 09:19.440
I'd say, on top of that, that the interesting thing about the Western mind as regards to

09:19.440 --> 09:24.000
slavery is that we were the civilization that did away with it.

09:24.000 --> 09:32.520
By the way, the founding fathers of America, who today are lambasted routinely for being

09:32.520 --> 09:41.120
acquiescent in the slave trade, engaging in it, owning slaves, people almost don't even

09:41.120 --> 09:47.240
bother now to recognize the fact that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, all wanted to

09:47.240 --> 09:51.520
see this trade done away with, couldn't hold the country together at the origins if they'd

09:51.520 --> 09:55.760
have made such an effort, and believed and hoped that it would be something that would

09:55.760 --> 09:58.840
be dealt with after their time.

09:58.840 --> 10:05.160
So the founding ideas had within them the notion that we should, as a people, get rid

10:05.160 --> 10:06.160
of this.

10:06.360 --> 10:14.640
The Declaration of Independence set up the conditions under which slavery will be impossible.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.160
All men are created equal.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.760
Once you've put that, that's a time bomb under the whole concept of slavery.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.920
That's ticking away.

10:24.920 --> 10:28.440
And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.

10:28.440 --> 10:34.680
If we just step back and look at the human species, what does slavery teach you about

10:34.680 --> 10:36.400
human nature?

10:36.400 --> 10:44.040
The fact that slavery has appeared as a function of society throughout human history.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.120
There are two possibilities.

10:48.120 --> 10:55.020
One is it's what people think they can do when God's not watching.

10:55.020 --> 10:58.520
Another is it's what they can do if they think that God allows it.

10:58.520 --> 11:02.400
Really, really well put.

11:02.400 --> 11:10.400
And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation, what does that mean?

11:10.400 --> 11:14.840
Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.120
There are people who get to work for free.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.600
It's economic in nature in some sense.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
Yes.

11:20.600 --> 11:24.880
But in order to do it, I mean, almost always, there are some examples in the ancient world

11:24.880 --> 11:28.520
where this wasn't the case, but almost always it had to be a subjugated people, or people

11:28.520 --> 11:29.520
regarded as different.

11:30.480 --> 11:35.000
One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject into the discussion through this

11:35.000 --> 11:40.800
book, among other things, is a recognition that there were very major questions still

11:40.800 --> 11:46.240
going on in the 18th and early 19th century that were unresolved, which were one of the

11:46.240 --> 11:53.680
reasons why slavery was not as morally repugnant to people then as it is to us now.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.880
And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.

11:57.840 --> 12:03.120
At the time of Thomas Jefferson, the founding fathers were thinking and working.

12:03.120 --> 12:11.720
They didn't know, because nobody knew, whether the human races were related or not.

12:11.720 --> 12:18.800
There were arguments, the monogenesis argument, that we were all indeed from the same racial

12:18.800 --> 12:20.920
stock.

12:20.920 --> 12:26.440
Polygenesis argument was that we weren't, black Africans, Ethiopians, and they're often

12:26.440 --> 12:31.760
referred to at the time, because they provided some of the first slaves, were different from

12:31.760 --> 12:35.680
white Europeans, simply not related in any way.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.360
And that makes it easier, of course.

12:37.360 --> 12:41.440
That makes it easier to enslave people if you think they're not your brother, am I my

12:41.440 --> 12:42.440
brother's keeper?

12:42.440 --> 12:46.560
No, he's not your brother.

12:46.560 --> 12:55.120
And it was a very troubling argument in the 18th and 19th century also because there was

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
a biblical question.

12:56.120 --> 13:02.920
It threw up a theological question, which was, people were literally debating this at

13:02.920 --> 13:05.200
the time.

13:05.200 --> 13:09.040
Was there also a black Adam and Eve?

13:09.040 --> 13:14.280
Was there an Indian Adam and Eve, a Native American Adam and Eve?

13:14.280 --> 13:19.480
This was a serious theological debate because they didn't know the answer.

13:19.480 --> 13:22.960
People say that Darwin solved this.

13:22.960 --> 13:29.440
It wasn't just Darwin, of course, but by the late 19th century, the argument that we were

13:29.440 --> 13:38.040
not all related as human beings had suffered so many blows that you had to really be very,

13:38.040 --> 13:41.480
very ignorant, deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.

13:41.480 --> 13:46.840
So it no longer was, after Darwin, a theological question, it became a moral question.

13:46.840 --> 13:51.440
It was already a moral question, but it clarified, Darwin clarifies it definitely.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.000
And then you're in this, as I say, you're in this situation of you're not subjugating

13:55.000 --> 13:58.880
some other people, you're subjugating your own kin.

13:58.880 --> 14:03.520
And that becomes morally unsustainable.

14:03.520 --> 14:16.000
So given that slavery in America is part of its history, how do we incorporate into the

14:16.080 --> 14:27.080
calculus of policy today, social discourse, what we learn in school, we can look at slavery in

14:27.080 --> 14:34.040
America, we can look at maybe more recent things like in Europe, the other atrocities,

14:34.040 --> 14:41.120
the Holocaust. How do we incorporate that in terms of how we create policy, how we treat each other,

14:41.160 --> 14:43.080
all those kinds of things.

14:43.080 --> 14:51.520
What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities, the injustices of the past into the way we are today?

14:51.520 --> 14:57.360
That's a very complex question, because it's a moral question at this point, and a moral question

14:57.360 --> 15:01.440
long after the fact.

15:01.440 --> 15:05.840
I say at one point, the war in the West, that the argument, for instance, on reparations now that

15:05.840 --> 15:08.960
goes on, and it's not a not a fringe argument anymore.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.960
Some people say, oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument.

15:10.960 --> 15:16.960
It really isn't. I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020

15:16.960 --> 15:20.320
was willing to talk about the possibility of reparations.

15:20.320 --> 15:30.520
Some very eager that this country, America, goes through that entirely self-destructive exercise.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.920
I say that there's a lot of problems with this, but if I could refine it out of one thing, I'd say

15:35.320 --> 15:40.760
this. It's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong to

15:40.760 --> 15:42.760
another group of people who were wronged.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.520
It would have been that 200 years ago.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.080
Today, it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people who were

15:51.080 --> 15:53.560
the descendants of people who were wronged.

15:53.560 --> 15:58.840
It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past, to another

15:58.840 --> 16:02.920
group of people who resemble people who were wronged.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.780
That's impossible to do.

16:04.780 --> 16:07.580
And I'm completely clear about this.

16:07.580 --> 16:11.380
There is no way in which you could organize

16:11.380 --> 16:16.380
such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.

16:17.100 --> 16:21.500
America is filled with people who have same skin color

16:21.500 --> 16:23.860
as us, for instance, who have no connection

16:23.860 --> 16:27.500
to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money

16:27.500 --> 16:30.580
to people who have some connection.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.160
And then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities

16:34.160 --> 16:39.240
who have come after slavery, who would not be due

16:39.240 --> 16:41.800
for any reimbursement, as it were.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.520
The problem with this is, though, is that there are,

16:46.520 --> 16:48.140
I'm perfectly open to the possibility

16:48.140 --> 16:51.920
that there are residual inequities that exist

16:51.920 --> 16:56.280
in American life and that the consequences of slavery

16:56.280 --> 17:00.160
could be one of the factors that resulted from this.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.520
The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.440
I think it's a multi-dimensional issue,

17:10.440 --> 17:12.600
something like black underachievement in America.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.600
It's obviously a multi-dimensional issue.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.380
Much of the left and others wish to say, it's not.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.400
It's only about racism.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.240
And they can't answer why Asians who've arrived

17:26.240 --> 17:29.080
more recently don't, for instance, get held down

17:29.080 --> 17:32.340
by white supremacy, but actually, I say white supremacy

17:32.340 --> 17:36.300
in quotes, obviously, but don't get held back by it,

17:36.300 --> 17:39.780
but actually flourish to the extent that Asian Americans

17:39.780 --> 17:43.340
have higher household earnings and higher household mean

17:46.400 --> 17:50.620
equity than, home equity and so on, than white Americans.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.580
So I don't think that on the merits, the evidence is there

17:55.580 --> 17:58.500
that racism is the explanation for black,

17:58.500 --> 18:00.860
ongoing black underachievement in some sections

18:00.860 --> 18:02.620
of the black community in America.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.780
It's obviously a part of it.

18:04.780 --> 18:08.980
Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness

18:08.980 --> 18:13.540
and similar family breakdown issues

18:14.540 --> 18:16.700
are a long-term consequence of it?

18:18.380 --> 18:21.340
Possibly, but it's being awfully generous

18:21.340 --> 18:24.900
to people's ability to make bad decisions.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.580
For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust

18:27.580 --> 18:30.660
would you allow people to claim that everything

18:30.660 --> 18:33.060
that went wrong in the Jewish community

18:33.060 --> 18:35.460
was as a result of the Holocaust?

18:35.460 --> 18:39.180
I mean, is there some kind of term limit on this?

18:39.180 --> 18:40.780
I would have thought so.

18:40.780 --> 18:43.580
And I think most people probably think that's over.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.700
I think the details matter there and,

18:50.300 --> 18:51.140
but it's very difficult.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.820
You're in deep waters here.

18:52.820 --> 18:54.380
I enjoy swimming out in the ocean.

18:54.380 --> 18:59.380
So although I'm terrified of what's lurking underneath

18:59.380 --> 19:00.300
in the darkness.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.260
You're right.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.260
You're right to be.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.340
Okay.

19:05.340 --> 19:07.100
It's really complicated calculus

19:07.100 --> 19:09.060
with the Holocaust and with slavery.

19:10.020 --> 19:14.020
So the argument in America is that there's

19:15.620 --> 19:20.380
deep institutional racism against African Americans

19:20.380 --> 19:22.100
that's rooted in slavery.

19:22.940 --> 19:27.940
And so however that calculus turns out,

19:28.060 --> 19:30.540
that calculation, it still persists

19:30.540 --> 19:33.140
in the culture and the institutions

19:33.140 --> 19:35.100
and the allocation of resources

19:35.100 --> 19:39.180
in the way that we communicate in subtle ways

19:39.180 --> 19:41.860
and major ways, all that kind of stuff.

19:41.860 --> 19:46.060
How is it possible to win or lose that argument

19:46.060 --> 19:48.100
of how much institutional racism there is

19:48.100 --> 19:50.780
that's rooted in slavery?

19:50.780 --> 19:51.700
Is it a winnable?

19:51.700 --> 19:53.860
It's an unquantifiable argument.

19:55.180 --> 19:59.420
And I'd like to apply some shortcuts to some of this

19:59.420 --> 20:00.620
and to the following.

20:01.940 --> 20:03.420
Are for instance all,

20:05.140 --> 20:08.300
let's take the EV-1 that's most often cited.

20:09.180 --> 20:12.020
If a white person is walking down a street in America

20:12.020 --> 20:14.540
and they see a group of young black men coming towards them

20:14.540 --> 20:16.980
and it's late at night and they cross the road,

20:16.980 --> 20:18.220
is it because of slavery?

20:19.220 --> 20:21.300
Is it because of institutional racism?

20:22.340 --> 20:25.780
No, it's because they've made a calculus based

20:25.780 --> 20:30.780
not entirely on unfounded beliefs

20:33.020 --> 20:36.420
that given crime rates,

20:36.420 --> 20:39.540
it's possible that this group of people

20:39.540 --> 20:40.540
might be a group of people

20:40.540 --> 20:42.580
they don't want to meet late at night.

20:42.580 --> 20:47.580
That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics show,

20:48.660 --> 20:51.260
and American cities after American cities bear out,

20:52.420 --> 20:55.180
it's not an entirely unreasonable one.

20:55.180 --> 20:59.420
It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.700
But is it attributable to slavery?

21:02.940 --> 21:04.100
That's a stretch.

21:05.660 --> 21:09.500
If you're in a city like Chicago

21:09.500 --> 21:14.500
where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years,

21:14.580 --> 21:17.740
albeit again, as always has to be remembered,

21:18.260 --> 21:22.940
mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.540
Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago

21:25.540 --> 21:28.180
and you make that calculus, I've just suggested

21:28.180 --> 21:31.620
the cliched one, the street late at night,

21:32.620 --> 21:36.300
there are other factors other than a memory of slavery

21:36.300 --> 21:37.140
that kick in.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.820
And I'm afraid it's something which people

21:42.820 --> 21:44.540
don't want to particularly acknowledge in America

21:44.540 --> 21:45.380
for obvious reasons,

21:45.380 --> 21:47.660
because it's the ugliest damn debate in the world.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.700
But I was actually just writing in my column

21:49.700 --> 21:53.340
in the New York Post today about a very interesting case,

21:53.340 --> 21:56.180
it's sort of similar, which is the question

21:56.180 --> 21:58.620
of obesity in the US.

21:58.620 --> 22:01.980
As you know, America's the most overweight country

22:01.980 --> 22:02.820
in the world.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.740
America has, I think, 40% of the population

22:06.740 --> 22:09.660
is obese in medical ways,

22:09.660 --> 22:12.340
and the nearest next country is a long way down,

22:12.340 --> 22:14.420
that's New Zealand, at 30% of the population.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.220
So America's a long way ahead.

22:16.220 --> 22:17.700
Why during the coronavirus era,

22:17.700 --> 22:22.700
when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor

22:23.460 --> 22:25.020
that's likely to lead to your hospitalization

22:25.020 --> 22:26.660
if you also get the virus,

22:26.660 --> 22:29.020
why did almost no public health information

22:29.020 --> 22:31.100
in America focus on obesity?

22:31.100 --> 22:34.260
80% of the people who ended up hospitalized in America

22:34.260 --> 22:36.860
with coronavirus were obese.

22:37.980 --> 22:41.100
We locked the schools when there was no evidence

22:41.100 --> 22:43.660
that the coronavirus was deadly for children.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.780
We all wore cloth masks when there was

22:46.300 --> 22:49.220
very little evidence that this was much use

22:49.220 --> 22:51.100
in stopping the spread of the virus.

22:52.180 --> 22:55.140
We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem,

22:55.140 --> 22:56.420
and we never addressed it.

22:56.420 --> 22:57.260
Why?

22:57.260 --> 22:58.940
Is it just because we worried about fat people?

22:58.940 --> 23:01.780
No, it's actually because about fat shaming, as it were.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.500
No, it's also because to a great extent,

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
it's a racial issue in America as well.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.620
And actually, I quoted this new publication

23:07.620 --> 23:10.180
from the University of Chicago as it happens,

23:10.180 --> 23:11.420
which makes that claim explicit.

23:11.420 --> 23:14.860
It says, the reasons why people have views

23:14.860 --> 23:16.300
that are negative about obesity

23:16.300 --> 23:18.620
is because of racism and slavery.

23:18.620 --> 23:21.220
This is what everything is drawn back to in America.

23:21.220 --> 23:22.940
Anything you want to stop,

23:22.940 --> 23:25.780
you say it's because of racism, it's because of slavery.

23:25.780 --> 23:30.780
How about it's actually because you mind

23:31.100 --> 23:32.460
the hospitals getting clogged up,

23:32.460 --> 23:34.260
you mind people dying,

23:34.260 --> 23:37.900
you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying,

23:37.900 --> 23:39.220
and you'd like to say something about it.

23:39.220 --> 23:41.020
Once again, as is in everything in America,

23:41.020 --> 23:46.020
it's cut off by some poorly educated academic

23:46.340 --> 23:48.620
saying it's about slavery.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.500
So we're really not, I mean,

23:50.500 --> 23:53.060
this requires a kind of form of brain surgery

23:53.060 --> 23:54.340
to perform it on a society,

23:54.340 --> 23:57.340
probably one that's not possible without killing the patient.

23:57.340 --> 24:02.340
And it's being done by people who are wearing like mittens.

24:04.860 --> 24:09.580
So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this

24:09.580 --> 24:12.180
that are rolling their eyes and saying,

24:12.180 --> 24:16.940
here we go again, two white guys talking about

24:16.940 --> 24:20.780
the lack of institutional racism in America.

24:23.180 --> 24:27.740
First of all, what would you like to tell them?

24:27.740 --> 24:31.940
So our African American friends who are looking at this,

24:31.940 --> 24:34.460
and I've gotten a chance to talk to a bunch of them

24:34.460 --> 24:35.780
on Clubhouse recently.

24:35.780 --> 24:37.180
Clubhouse is this social app.

24:37.180 --> 24:38.020
Yeah, yeah, I know.

24:38.020 --> 24:41.220
It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.540
I personally love it because you get to talk to,

24:44.540 --> 24:48.020
as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much,

24:48.020 --> 24:52.100
I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.500
So it gave me a chance to, first of all,

24:54.500 --> 24:56.700
practice Russian and Ukrainian.

24:56.700 --> 24:58.340
So I get the chance to do that.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.580
Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine

25:00.580 --> 25:04.940
with people who are from that part of the world.

25:04.980 --> 25:09.980
And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground

25:10.180 --> 25:14.060
where they start screaming, they start crying,

25:14.060 --> 25:16.940
they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.

25:16.940 --> 25:20.460
And this is as if you walked into a bar

25:20.460 --> 25:24.940
with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.

25:24.940 --> 25:29.180
Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences,

25:29.180 --> 25:34.020
real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases,

25:34.020 --> 25:37.100
and you get to listen to them go at it with no,

25:38.140 --> 25:39.700
because it's an audio app,

25:39.700 --> 25:41.460
you're not allowed to start getting

25:41.460 --> 25:43.580
into a physical fist fight.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.380
So even though it really sounds like people want to.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.580
Sounds like it's happening, yeah.

25:47.580 --> 25:50.180
Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.

25:50.180 --> 25:53.500
And for example, it allows a white guy like me

25:53.500 --> 25:55.380
from another part of the world

25:55.380 --> 25:58.320
coming from the former Soviet Union

25:58.320 --> 26:03.320
to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans

26:03.520 --> 26:07.760
screaming about Joe Rogan using the N-word.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.120
And I get to really listen.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.480
There's very different perspectives on that

26:11.480 --> 26:13.200
in the African American community.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.680
And it's fascinating to listen.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.040
So I don't get access to that by sort of excellent books

26:19.040 --> 26:20.480
and articles written and so on.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.320
You get that real raw emotion.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.520
And I'm just saying, there's a few of those folks

26:24.520 --> 26:27.720
listening to this with that real raw emotion.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.980
And they, one argument they say is you,

26:31.980 --> 26:33.700
Douglas Murray and you, Lex Freeman,

26:33.700 --> 26:37.300
don't have the right to talk about race

26:37.300 --> 26:38.700
and racism in America.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.460
It is our struggle.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.460
You are from a privileged class of people

26:42.460 --> 26:47.460
that don't know what it's like to be a black man

26:48.020 --> 26:51.020
or woman in America walking down the street.

26:51.020 --> 26:52.780
Can you steel man that case?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.060
First of all, fuck that.

26:56.060 --> 26:59.860
Okay, that's not, I think we need to define steel,

26:59.940 --> 27:00.700
steel manning.

27:00.700 --> 27:04.980
Okay, I know what steel manning is.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.740
I really resent that form of argumentation.

27:07.740 --> 27:09.340
I really resent it.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.820
I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want.

27:11.820 --> 27:14.740
And no one's gonna stop me or try to intimidate me

27:14.740 --> 27:18.100
or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.180
And I think that if I said to somebody else

27:20.180 --> 27:23.380
the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.500
If I said, shut up, you have no right to criticize anything

27:26.500 --> 27:27.460
that Douglas Murray says

27:27.460 --> 27:29.300
because you've not got my skin color.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.180
Okay, it's not an exact comparison,

27:32.180 --> 27:36.340
but seriously, is that a reasonable form of argument?

27:36.340 --> 27:37.460
You haven't been through everything

27:37.460 --> 27:39.860
I've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.620
No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything.

27:43.620 --> 27:47.220
We might as well pack up, go home, and isolate ourselves.

27:47.220 --> 27:49.940
Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case?

27:49.940 --> 27:51.300
Not in this particular situation,

27:51.300 --> 27:56.020
but there's people that have lived through something

27:57.180 --> 27:59.060
that can comment in a very specific way.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.820
For example, Holocaust survivors.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.660
Yes.

28:03.140 --> 28:07.620
There is a sense in which maybe a basic sense of civility

28:07.620 --> 28:10.100
when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about

28:10.100 --> 28:12.180
their experience of the Holocaust,

28:12.180 --> 28:17.180
then an intellectual from a very different part of the world

28:17.180 --> 28:21.620
that's simply writing about nuanced geopolitics

28:21.620 --> 28:25.260
of World War II just should not interrupt

28:25.260 --> 28:26.740
the Holocaust survivor.

28:26.740 --> 28:27.900
We physically interrupt them

28:27.900 --> 28:29.700
if they're telling their story.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.260
With logic and reason that the experience

28:33.260 --> 28:36.940
of the Holocaust survivor somehow fundamentally

28:36.940 --> 28:39.740
has a deeper understanding of the humanity

28:39.740 --> 28:42.220
and the injustice of that.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.100
First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now,

28:45.100 --> 28:48.460
but in terms of wanting to listen to another person

28:48.460 --> 28:51.860
who has experienced something, yes, yes,

28:52.700 --> 28:56.540
but not endlessly, not endlessly.

28:56.540 --> 28:58.340
I mean, there are some people who've written about the,

28:58.340 --> 29:00.060
I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust

29:00.060 --> 29:02.300
who didn't experience the Holocaust

29:02.300 --> 29:04.940
and have written about it better than people who did.

29:06.140 --> 29:09.820
It's not, this idea that the lived experience

29:09.820 --> 29:12.260
to use this terrible modern jargon

29:12.260 --> 29:14.060
as if there's another type,

29:14.060 --> 29:16.340
this idea that the lived experience

29:16.340 --> 29:20.700
has to triumph over everything else is not always correct.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.700
It can be correct in some circumstances.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.260
If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor

29:26.940 --> 29:28.620
and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust

29:28.620 --> 29:31.420
and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it,

29:32.300 --> 29:33.980
yeah, one of those people should be heard

29:33.980 --> 29:36.300
more than the other, obviously, obviously.

29:37.260 --> 29:40.060
If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand

29:40.060 --> 29:42.980
and there's somebody else who has never experienced it,

29:42.980 --> 29:45.340
then obviously you'd want to hear from the person

29:45.340 --> 29:47.540
who has experienced it firsthand

29:47.540 --> 29:49.740
if that is the discussion underway.

29:51.980 --> 29:53.900
I don't think that it's the case

29:53.900 --> 29:55.980
that that is endlessly the case.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.740
I'm also highly reluctant to concede

30:00.740 --> 30:02.060
that there are groups of people

30:02.060 --> 30:06.260
who by dint of their skin color or anything else

30:06.260 --> 30:08.180
get to dominate the microphone.

30:08.180 --> 30:09.500
Now, of course, we're literally both speaking

30:09.500 --> 30:11.660
to microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this,

30:11.660 --> 30:13.580
but let's skate over the irony.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.940
What I mean is people saying you don't have the right

30:17.940 --> 30:20.700
to speak, I have the right to take the microphone from you

30:20.700 --> 30:23.260
and speak because I know best.

30:23.260 --> 30:27.300
Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out

30:27.300 --> 30:29.900
and someone will win long or short term.

30:31.340 --> 30:36.340
But the almost aggressive tone

30:36.940 --> 30:40.300
in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of.

30:41.220 --> 30:44.460
Nobody's experience is completely understandable

30:44.460 --> 30:47.420
by another human being, nobody's.

30:47.420 --> 30:50.100
And what many people are asking us to do at the moment,

30:50.100 --> 30:53.140
us collectively is to fall for that thing.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.460
I think it was Camille Foster who said it first,

30:55.460 --> 30:57.900
but I've adopted in recent years,

30:57.900 --> 31:01.180
is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life

31:01.180 --> 31:05.820
trying to understand me personally, my lived experience,

31:05.820 --> 31:09.220
everything about me, you should dedicate your life

31:09.220 --> 31:11.180
to trying to do that.

31:11.180 --> 31:14.220
Simultaneously, you'll never understand me.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.820
This is not an attractive invitation.

31:18.940 --> 31:22.700
This is an unwinnable game.

31:22.700 --> 31:27.700
So if somebody has a legitimate and important point

31:29.900 --> 31:31.940
to make, they should make it and they'll win

31:31.940 --> 31:34.100
through whatever their character is and whatever their race.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.740
And by the way, there are plenty of white people

31:35.740 --> 31:37.580
who experience racism as well.

31:37.580 --> 31:40.980
There are plenty of white people who do and have done,

31:40.980 --> 31:42.900
and increasingly so, which is one of the things

31:42.900 --> 31:44.620
I write about from the war on the West.

31:44.620 --> 31:47.580
I mean, I would argue that today in America,

31:47.580 --> 31:49.260
the only group who are actually allowed

31:49.260 --> 31:53.940
to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people.

31:53.940 --> 31:57.060
If you say disgusting things about black people in America

31:57.060 --> 31:59.380
in 2022, you will be over.

32:00.500 --> 32:01.980
You will be over.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.980
If you decide to talk about people's white tears,

32:04.980 --> 32:07.980
their white female tears, their white guilt,

32:07.980 --> 32:10.580
their white privilege, their white rage,

32:10.580 --> 32:13.900
and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms,

32:13.900 --> 32:14.940
you'll be just fine.

32:14.940 --> 32:17.140
You can be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.100
You can lecture at Yale University, absolutely fine.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.220
And the white people have to suck that up

32:22.220 --> 32:24.980
as if that's fine because there was racism

32:24.980 --> 32:26.380
in another direction in the past.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.900
So white people can have racism as well.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.700
Does that mean that I think that I have a right

32:30.700 --> 32:33.060
or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse

32:33.060 --> 32:34.340
by talking about their feelings

32:34.340 --> 32:37.540
of having been the victims of racism?

32:37.540 --> 32:39.780
No, not particularly, because what does that get us?

32:39.780 --> 32:43.580
It gets us into a endless cycle of competitive victimhood.

32:43.580 --> 32:46.980
Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence

32:47.820 --> 32:49.860
have experienced historically anything like the violence

32:49.860 --> 32:51.540
that was perpetrated against black people

32:51.540 --> 32:52.900
in America historically?

32:52.900 --> 32:54.340
Obviously not.

32:54.340 --> 32:59.180
But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?

33:00.500 --> 33:05.060
And this is very, very important terrain now in America

33:05.060 --> 33:06.980
because there's one other thing I have to throw in there,

33:06.980 --> 33:10.940
which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?

33:11.900 --> 33:15.420
How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?

33:15.420 --> 33:17.940
At one point in this latest book,

33:17.940 --> 33:21.780
I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche

33:21.780 --> 33:25.900
and the genealogy of morals, where, as you know,

33:25.900 --> 33:27.740
Nietzsche always has to be treated carefully.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.220
You know, when people say, I love Nietzsche,

33:30.220 --> 33:32.260
you have to say, which bits?

33:34.260 --> 33:36.500
What exactly do you love about him?

33:37.780 --> 33:42.780
But he, and a lot can be learned from the answer,

33:43.460 --> 33:46.900
but there are moments in genealogy of morals

33:46.900 --> 33:49.140
that were very useful for this book.

33:49.140 --> 33:51.820
One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase

33:51.820 --> 33:54.140
that I've now stolen from myself, appropriated,

33:54.140 --> 33:58.380
you might say, where he refers to people

33:58.380 --> 34:02.860
who tear at wounds long since closed

34:02.860 --> 34:04.820
and then cry about the pain they feel.

34:07.500 --> 34:12.500
Now, how do you know whether the pain is real?

34:13.780 --> 34:15.260
How do you know?

34:15.260 --> 34:20.020
I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.540
So when somebody says, I feel that my life

34:22.540 --> 34:24.500
hasn't gone that well and it's because of something

34:24.500 --> 34:27.540
that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago,

34:27.540 --> 34:29.580
maybe they do feel that.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.860
Maybe they're right to feel that.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.860
Maybe they're making it up.

34:33.860 --> 34:37.220
Maybe they're using it as a reason for failure in life.

34:37.220 --> 34:40.740
Maybe they're using it as a reason to not even try.

34:40.820 --> 34:44.940
Maybe they're using it as a reason to smoke weed all day.

34:44.940 --> 34:47.020
I don't know, and who does know?

34:47.020 --> 34:48.940
How can you work that out?

34:48.940 --> 34:50.780
And that's why I come back to this thing of,

34:50.780 --> 34:54.460
who are we to constantly judge in this society,

34:54.460 --> 34:58.060
other people who we don't know and attribute motives

34:58.060 --> 35:02.620
to them based on racial or other characteristics?

35:03.820 --> 35:05.540
And as you write in this part,

35:05.540 --> 35:10.540
I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche

35:11.900 --> 35:14.900
and at the same time canceling Nietzsche

35:16.300 --> 35:17.820
in the same set of sentences,

35:17.820 --> 35:20.500
but you write in this part about evil.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.940
No, I didn't cancel Nietzsche.

35:22.940 --> 35:27.100
Can't cancel Nietzsche, I was saying treat him carefully.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.660
Treat him carefully, fair enough.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.820
But you can judge a man's character

35:31.820 --> 35:35.100
by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.

35:35.260 --> 35:36.580
Fair enough.

35:36.580 --> 35:38.540
I think when you meet people who do man and Superman

35:38.540 --> 35:40.180
a bit too much, you're in a...

35:42.180 --> 35:45.300
Now you're pulling in even deeper water

35:45.300 --> 35:47.100
referencing Hitler here.

35:47.100 --> 35:51.100
Okay, so you write in this part of the book about evil.

35:53.180 --> 35:57.260
Quote, what is it that drives evil?

35:57.260 --> 35:59.380
Many things without doubt, but one of them

35:59.380 --> 36:02.260
is identified by several of the great philosophers

36:02.260 --> 36:04.420
is resentment.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.580
That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers

36:06.580 --> 36:09.420
for people who want to destroy.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.180
Colon, blaming someone else for having something

36:12.180 --> 36:14.180
you believe you deserve more.

36:14.180 --> 36:17.500
And you're saying this kind of resentment,

36:17.500 --> 36:21.180
we don't know as it surfaces whether it's genuine

36:21.180 --> 36:26.180
or if it's used to sort of play games of power to evil ends.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.820
Can you speak to this?

36:31.340 --> 36:34.820
To this, because it's such a fascinating idea

36:34.820 --> 36:39.020
that one of the biggest drivers of evil in the world

36:40.140 --> 36:41.460
is resentment.

36:41.460 --> 36:45.060
Because if you look at, boy, if you look at human history,

36:45.060 --> 36:48.540
if you look at Hitler, so much of the propaganda,

36:48.540 --> 36:51.180
so much of the narrative was about resentment.

36:52.180 --> 36:55.220
So is that surface or is it level or is that deep?

36:55.220 --> 36:56.060
The resentment that drives deep.

36:56.060 --> 36:58.220
It can be any of the above.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.740
First of all, everybody has resentment.

37:02.620 --> 37:06.180
I use the term resentment, which is thought very similar

37:06.180 --> 37:08.220
to resentment, less stick with resentment.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.340
So we don't sound too pretentious.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.340
Let me give you a quick example of somebody in our own day

37:19.340 --> 37:22.660
who has a form of resentment, Vladimir Putin.

37:23.860 --> 37:27.460
Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace?

37:28.460 --> 37:30.780
You remember the stuff about Putin

37:30.780 --> 37:33.700
as a young KGB officer in Germany?

37:33.700 --> 37:36.460
And the stuff about Putin and his first wife's resentment

37:36.460 --> 37:39.660
of one of his KGB colleagues who had an apartment

37:39.660 --> 37:42.660
that was a few meters bigger than the Putin's apartment.

37:43.780 --> 37:44.620
Yeah.

37:44.620 --> 37:45.540
It's very interesting.

37:45.540 --> 37:48.580
And by the way, I'm not saying that Vladimir Putin

37:48.580 --> 37:50.700
became the man he has become and invaded Ukraine

37:50.700 --> 37:52.500
because he didn't have an apartment he liked

37:52.500 --> 37:54.340
in Berlin or Munich or everywhere.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.100
What is this distinct possibility?

37:56.140 --> 38:01.140
My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives

38:03.340 --> 38:06.140
and we all feel it in our lives.

38:06.140 --> 38:09.340
And it's something that has to be struggled against.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.940
Resentment is, in political terms, can be a deadly,

38:13.940 --> 38:16.660
I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon.

38:17.780 --> 38:18.980
I mean, you mentioned Hitler.

38:18.980 --> 38:21.380
Obviously one of the things that Hitler played on

38:21.380 --> 38:22.940
was resentment, obviously.

38:23.780 --> 38:27.100
Almost every revolution he does.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.820
I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well.

38:28.820 --> 38:30.660
And we're not without cause.

38:31.660 --> 38:33.940
There's a good reason to feel that Versailles

38:33.940 --> 38:38.060
was not listening to Paris in the 1780s

38:38.060 --> 38:41.740
and feel resentment for Marie Antoinette

38:41.740 --> 38:44.260
in her palace within the palace,

38:44.260 --> 38:47.420
ignoring the bread shortages in Paris.

38:48.260 --> 38:52.980
So resentment is a very understandable thing

38:52.980 --> 38:54.900
and sometimes it's justifiable

38:54.900 --> 38:59.020
and it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society.

38:59.020 --> 39:01.660
It's an incredibly deep sentiment.

39:01.660 --> 39:04.980
Somebody else has got something that you should have.

39:05.940 --> 39:09.180
And the problem about it is that it has the potential

39:09.180 --> 39:10.020
to be endless.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.140
You can do it your whole life.

39:13.140 --> 39:16.260
And one of the ways I've sort of found myself

39:16.300 --> 39:18.380
explaining this to people is to say,

39:18.380 --> 39:20.300
it's also important to recognize that resentment

39:20.300 --> 39:23.300
is something that can cross absolutely every boundary.

39:24.220 --> 39:27.580
So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries,

39:27.580 --> 39:30.300
obviously, it goes without saying.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.780
More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries

39:32.780 --> 39:34.580
and socioeconomic boundaries.

39:35.460 --> 39:38.140
And if I was to sort of simplify this thought,

39:38.140 --> 39:41.540
I would say, I guess that you and I

39:41.540 --> 39:44.740
and everybody watching knows

39:44.780 --> 39:47.860
or has known somebody in their lives

39:47.860 --> 39:52.860
who has almost nothing in worldly terms

39:53.540 --> 39:57.060
and is a generous person, a kindly person,

39:57.060 --> 40:02.060
a giving person, a happy person even, a cheerful person.

40:03.340 --> 40:06.460
And I think we probably have also,

40:06.460 --> 40:07.940
or many of us will have met people

40:07.940 --> 40:09.340
who seem to have everything

40:10.900 --> 40:14.660
and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.420
Somebody else has held them back from something,

40:16.420 --> 40:19.780
their sister once did something, she got this

40:19.780 --> 40:23.460
and I should have got that and on and on and on.

40:23.460 --> 40:25.220
It's a human trait.

40:25.220 --> 40:28.100
And one of the things that suggests to me

40:28.100 --> 40:30.860
is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.340
This is something which we can do something about,

40:33.340 --> 40:34.860
not limitlessly.

40:35.780 --> 40:39.140
But for instance, I mean, there are very good reasons

40:39.140 --> 40:42.500
that some people in their lives might feel resentment.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.340
Let's say you're involved in a car crash

40:45.340 --> 40:47.780
and a friend fell asleep at the wheel

40:47.780 --> 40:49.980
and that's why you are spending the rest of your life

40:49.980 --> 40:51.420
in a wheelchair.

40:51.420 --> 40:52.660
That's a pertinent example of this

40:52.660 --> 40:54.420
in American politics at the moment.

40:56.820 --> 40:59.260
You would be justified in feeling resentment.

41:00.300 --> 41:02.260
And at some point you have to make a decision

41:02.260 --> 41:07.260
which is, am I going to be that person or a different person?

41:08.300 --> 41:11.100
But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level

41:11.100 --> 41:13.820
and that societal level is destructive to the mind.

41:13.820 --> 41:16.100
Even when you're, quote unquote, justified.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.420
It rots you.

41:17.420 --> 41:20.860
It rots you because the best you can do

41:21.980 --> 41:25.780
is to eke out your days unfulfilled.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.060
So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.

41:30.060 --> 41:31.100
Yes.

41:31.100 --> 41:35.660
Gratitude is the antidote to evil, in a sense.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.340
Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level.

41:38.340 --> 41:40.780
Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.

41:41.780 --> 41:44.780
I quote in The War on the West,

41:44.780 --> 41:47.020
when I read it the first time a few years ago,

41:47.020 --> 41:51.300
I was absolutely floored by the Brothers Karamazov.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.580
Not everything in it, by the way,

41:53.580 --> 41:54.580
when I went and get into it,

41:54.580 --> 41:59.580
but I have some very big structural criticisms of the novel.

41:59.740 --> 42:01.620
Now you're sweet talking to me

42:01.620 --> 42:04.980
because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this.

42:04.980 --> 42:06.340
Oh, okay.

42:06.340 --> 42:07.740
Well, we could get into what I see

42:07.740 --> 42:09.580
as having the structural flaws in the Brothers Karamazov.

42:09.580 --> 42:12.260
Anyway, now I'm offended and triggered.

42:12.260 --> 42:17.060
Yeah, no, I mean, this is coming out of Macbeth

42:17.060 --> 42:19.100
and saying, I didn't think it was much good.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.780
Yeah, there's structural flaws.

42:20.780 --> 42:23.180
Yeah, I thought the ending stank.

42:23.180 --> 42:24.020
Yeah.

42:24.020 --> 42:24.840
The middle wasn't very good.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.180
No, when I read that novel,

42:28.180 --> 42:30.060
I was floored by a couple of things.

42:30.060 --> 42:32.180
One is, of course, at the moment

42:32.180 --> 42:34.020
where we realize the devil appears.

42:34.940 --> 42:37.500
The moment that Ivan says to his brother,

42:38.260 --> 42:39.380
you know he visits me,

42:39.380 --> 42:41.940
and you realize that he's talking about the devil,

42:41.940 --> 42:46.940
the whole novel goes into this totally different space.

42:47.620 --> 42:49.100
Anyway, it's even more

42:49.100 --> 42:51.700
than you've already realized the novel's about.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.740
And then when the conversation occurs

42:53.740 --> 42:56.180
between Ivan and the devil,

42:56.180 --> 42:59.860
remember, I think he describes him as dressed as a French,

42:59.860 --> 43:01.460
dressed in the French style

43:02.900 --> 43:06.060
of the early part of the 19th century,

43:06.100 --> 43:07.700
very strange that the devil would be dressed like that,

43:07.700 --> 43:08.540
but sort of,

43:10.820 --> 43:13.620
and if you remember that he's sort of cross-legged

43:13.620 --> 43:15.060
and rather a Bane figure.

43:16.100 --> 43:19.580
But the devil mentions, in passing to Ivan,

43:19.580 --> 43:22.220
that he says, I don't know why,

43:22.220 --> 43:27.220
gratitude is not an instinct that's been given to me.

43:30.020 --> 43:32.180
And yeah, you're not allowed,

43:32.180 --> 43:35.860
this is not, given the role of being the devil,

43:36.700 --> 43:38.060
this is not one of the things, just not one of the things.

43:38.060 --> 43:39.260
And you think, and of course,

43:39.260 --> 43:42.060
only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could,

43:42.060 --> 43:45.100
I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel

43:45.100 --> 43:46.180
out of that insight.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.300
Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away,

43:49.300 --> 43:51.420
because there's such an abundance of riches

43:51.420 --> 43:53.500
that he still has to get through,

43:53.500 --> 43:55.300
the structural problems aside.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.140
But the...

43:58.820 --> 44:00.900
The passive-aggressive,

44:00.900 --> 44:04.380
the microaggression in this conversation is palpable.

44:06.020 --> 44:08.380
Little knife fight, you know?

44:08.380 --> 44:09.940
But the reason I mention this is because, of course,

44:09.940 --> 44:13.460
when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight

44:13.460 --> 44:16.940
by Dostoevsky, because why would gratitude

44:16.940 --> 44:19.900
not be a sentiment the devil was capable of?

44:19.900 --> 44:21.380
And the answer is, of course,

44:21.380 --> 44:23.780
that if the devil was capable of gratitude,

44:23.780 --> 44:27.140
he wouldn't be the devil, he'd be somebody else.

44:28.740 --> 44:31.460
He has to be incapable of gratitude.

44:31.460 --> 44:32.820
Do you think, for Dostoevsky,

44:32.820 --> 44:36.740
that was as strong of an insight as it is for you?

44:36.740 --> 44:39.460
Because I think that's a really powerful idea

44:39.460 --> 44:43.860
that, with gratitude, you don't get the resentment

44:43.860 --> 44:46.100
that rots you from the core.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.900
Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things

44:48.900 --> 44:50.780
that he saw in us.

44:50.780 --> 44:53.980
And the way I put it is that, I mean,

44:53.980 --> 44:57.900
I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,

44:57.900 --> 44:59.900
which is one of the things I'd like us to call the era

44:59.900 --> 45:00.900
that's now ending.

45:01.900 --> 45:05.500
The era of deconstruction was the era that started,

45:05.500 --> 45:07.940
let's say, from the 60s onwards,

45:07.940 --> 45:11.300
and was originally an academic game

45:11.300 --> 45:13.300
that then spilled out into the wider culture,

45:13.300 --> 45:16.540
which was, let's take everything apart,

45:16.540 --> 45:17.860
let's pull it all apart.

45:19.100 --> 45:20.460
There are lots of problems with it.

45:20.460 --> 45:22.620
One is it's quite boring.

45:22.620 --> 45:25.260
You don't get an awful lot from it.

45:27.460 --> 45:30.340
You also have the problem of what children find

45:30.820 --> 45:32.580
when they try to do this with bicycles,

45:32.580 --> 45:34.460
which is they can take it apart quite easily,

45:34.460 --> 45:36.260
but they can't put it back together.

45:38.140 --> 45:43.140
And the era of taking things apart as a game

45:45.260 --> 45:48.220
is one we've lived through, and it's been highly destructive.

45:48.220 --> 45:50.620
But you can do it for quite a long time.

45:51.580 --> 45:53.140
I'm going to look at this society,

45:53.140 --> 45:56.660
and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic problems.

45:56.660 --> 46:00.380
I'm going to, at the end of that, what have you got?

46:00.380 --> 46:01.220
What have you done?

46:01.220 --> 46:03.140
What have you achieved?

46:03.140 --> 46:05.460
We need to interrogate this.

46:05.460 --> 46:07.420
Okay, interrogate, by all means, ask questions,

46:07.420 --> 46:11.140
but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this.

46:11.140 --> 46:13.300
I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart,

46:13.300 --> 46:15.700
and again, at the end of it, what have you got?

46:16.980 --> 46:21.140
Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music

46:21.140 --> 46:24.500
or an idea or a society, fine.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.260
Question, endlessly question.

46:26.820 --> 46:31.820
Interrogate assumes it's all a criminal in a cell,

46:33.540 --> 46:37.620
and it's guilty, and therefore it must be taken apart.

46:37.620 --> 46:41.140
And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West.

46:41.140 --> 46:43.780
And that's resentment.

46:43.780 --> 46:46.180
That's one byproduct of resentment.

46:46.180 --> 46:49.700
You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.

46:50.980 --> 46:53.500
Is a little bit of resentment good?

46:53.500 --> 46:56.980
So you have, you know that, I love Tom Waits,

46:56.980 --> 47:00.260
and he has a song where a little drop of,

47:00.260 --> 47:03.060
I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.

47:03.060 --> 47:06.420
Is it good to do that, is it good to have a little bit

47:06.420 --> 47:08.340
of poison in your drink?

47:08.340 --> 47:10.620
Depends what the poison is, and it depends if you know

47:10.620 --> 47:11.980
not to have another drink.

47:13.740 --> 47:16.180
It might be the case you find out as some alcoholics too

47:16.180 --> 47:19.860
that one was too many and 10 is not enough.

47:20.860 --> 47:24.740
So there's a natural, in this case,

47:24.740 --> 47:27.540
this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.

47:27.540 --> 47:29.500
It becomes an addiction, it becomes a drug,

47:29.500 --> 47:30.820
and you just can't stop.

47:30.820 --> 47:32.580
Well, you'd have to wean yourself off it

47:32.580 --> 47:34.340
and try to start creating again.

47:35.300 --> 47:37.940
You'd have to start trying to put things together again.

47:40.140 --> 47:44.900
Something I think might be in the throes of starting

47:44.900 --> 47:45.740
as it happens.

47:46.740 --> 47:51.180
Well, speaking of taking things apart

47:51.180 --> 47:53.300
and not putting them together again,

47:53.300 --> 47:55.460
the idea of critical race theory.

47:57.980 --> 48:02.020
Can you, to me, explain, so I'm an engineer

48:02.020 --> 48:04.860
and have not been actually paying attention much,

48:04.860 --> 48:07.340
unfortunately, to these things.

48:07.340 --> 48:09.260
None of the people in your field were until it comes along

48:09.260 --> 48:11.020
and smacks you in the face.

48:11.020 --> 48:14.820
I, you know, I've had that line of thinking

48:15.780 --> 48:19.940
from MIT, I said, well, surely,

48:19.940 --> 48:23.580
whatever you folks are busy about yelling at each other for

48:23.580 --> 48:26.100
is a thing at Harvard and Yale.

48:26.100 --> 48:27.020
It's not going to be.

48:27.020 --> 48:28.820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

48:28.820 --> 48:31.420
People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us,

48:31.420 --> 48:33.700
it can't come to us, and bang.

48:33.700 --> 48:36.900
Well, it hasn't quite been a bang, I'm not sure.

48:36.900 --> 48:39.580
Engineering is more safe than others.

48:39.580 --> 48:43.020
Yeah, so let's draw a line now

48:43.020 --> 48:45.380
between engineering and science.

48:45.380 --> 48:48.220
So I think engineering is,

48:48.220 --> 48:51.940
I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower

48:51.940 --> 48:55.260
with my pinky out drinking my martini saying surely,

48:56.380 --> 49:00.620
the peasants below with their biology and their humanities

49:00.620 --> 49:02.420
will figure it all out.

49:02.420 --> 49:04.380
No, I'm just kidding, there's no pinky out.

49:04.380 --> 49:07.420
I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.

49:07.420 --> 49:09.740
Okay, where has this metaphor gone too far?

49:10.380 --> 49:14.460
Uh, can you explain to this engineer

49:14.460 --> 49:16.420
what critical race theory is?

49:16.420 --> 49:19.460
Is it a term that's definable?

49:19.460 --> 49:21.500
Is there a tradition, is there a history,

49:21.500 --> 49:24.260
what is good about it, what is bad about it?

49:24.260 --> 49:25.620
It is a tradition, it is a history,

49:25.620 --> 49:28.940
it's a school of thought, it started in the law

49:28.940 --> 49:31.740
roughly in the 1970s in some of the American academy.

49:32.700 --> 49:36.740
It spilled out, it always aimed to be an activist philosophy.

49:36.740 --> 49:39.100
People deny that now, but as I cite them

49:39.100 --> 49:41.700
in the war on the west and the foundational texts

49:41.700 --> 49:46.700
say as much, this is an activist academic study.

49:48.220 --> 49:50.580
We're not just looking at the law,

49:50.580 --> 49:52.180
we seek to change the law.

49:53.580 --> 49:56.180
And it's spilled out into all of the other disciplines.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.620
I think there's a reason for that by the way,

49:57.620 --> 49:59.580
which is it happened at the time that the humanities

49:59.580 --> 50:02.060
and others in America were increasingly weak

50:02.060 --> 50:04.860
and didn't know what to do and they needed more games

50:04.860 --> 50:06.780
to play or new games to play.

50:07.780 --> 50:09.420
The psychologists got bored.

50:09.420 --> 50:12.780
Yeah, I mean that, well, they needed tenure

50:12.780 --> 50:14.620
and they needed something to do.

50:14.620 --> 50:16.860
And I mean, it's not an original observation,

50:16.860 --> 50:17.780
plenty of people have made this,

50:17.780 --> 50:19.740
but I mean, Neil Ferguson said this some time ago,

50:19.740 --> 50:23.420
for instance, that in the last 50 years

50:23.420 --> 50:26.380
in American academia, certainly in humanities departments,

50:26.380 --> 50:29.900
when somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something,

50:29.900 --> 50:33.300
that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature.

50:33.300 --> 50:36.060
They're replaced by somebody who does theory

50:36.060 --> 50:38.060
or critical race theory.

50:38.060 --> 50:41.540
They're replaced by somebody who does the modern games.

50:41.540 --> 50:44.460
Somebody dies out who's a great historian of say,

50:44.460 --> 50:46.940
I don't know, it's the one that's on my mind,

50:46.940 --> 50:48.700
Russian history or Russian literature,

50:48.700 --> 50:53.620
and they're not replaced by a similar scholar.

50:53.620 --> 50:55.860
In his observation and in yours,

50:55.860 --> 50:57.660
is this a recent development?

50:57.660 --> 50:59.940
It's happened in the last few decades for sure.

50:59.940 --> 51:01.500
And it's sped up.

51:01.500 --> 51:02.940
Is it because we've gotten to the bottom

51:02.940 --> 51:04.940
of some of the biggest questions of history?

51:04.940 --> 51:08.260
No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions.

51:09.260 --> 51:12.140
Because it's more fun to, big questions aren't as fun?

51:12.140 --> 51:13.820
No, partly it's, partly it's,

51:13.820 --> 51:15.420
no, I should stress it, partly it's,

51:15.420 --> 51:17.620
this is in the weeks, but partly it's a result

51:17.620 --> 51:19.900
of the hyper-specialization in academia.

51:21.300 --> 51:24.340
You know, if you said you'd like to

51:24.340 --> 51:26.700
write your dissertation on Hobbes,

51:31.460 --> 51:32.300
if you wanted to,

51:35.900 --> 51:39.060
something central to Kant's thought or Hegel or something,

51:39.060 --> 51:42.380
I mean, that's not popular.

51:42.380 --> 51:44.900
That what's popular is to take somebody

51:44.900 --> 51:46.380
way down the line from that,

51:46.380 --> 51:48.900
because there's a feeling that that's all been done.

51:49.900 --> 51:52.700
So you take something way, way, way down the line from that,

51:52.700 --> 51:54.220
that's much less important,

51:54.220 --> 51:55.980
and then you sort of play with that.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.900
And I think most people, anyone who's watching,

51:58.900 --> 52:00.980
who's been in a philosophy department

52:00.980 --> 52:04.340
or anything else in recent years will know that tendency.

52:04.340 --> 52:06.900
By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this.

52:06.900 --> 52:09.020
I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life

52:09.020 --> 52:11.340
when he would occasionally,

52:11.340 --> 52:13.580
he didn't get tenure at universities,

52:13.580 --> 52:17.300
but he would occasionally be flown in even by his enemies

52:17.300 --> 52:19.140
to teach courses in various universities

52:19.140 --> 52:20.980
in basics of philosophy,

52:20.980 --> 52:24.380
because there was no one in the department able to do it.

52:24.380 --> 52:28.540
Like, he would go in and teach for a semester,

52:29.500 --> 52:34.020
you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others,

52:34.020 --> 52:36.100
because there was no one to do it,

52:36.100 --> 52:38.100
because they were all playing with the things

52:38.100 --> 52:40.620
way, way, way down the road from this.

52:40.620 --> 52:42.940
So that had already happened,

52:42.940 --> 52:45.260
and people were searching for new games to play,

52:45.260 --> 52:48.860
and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in,

52:50.060 --> 52:52.540
partly in the way that all of this

52:52.540 --> 52:54.540
that's now known as anti-racism does,

52:54.540 --> 52:56.740
which is in a sort of bullying tone,

52:56.740 --> 52:58.180
of saying, if you don't follow this.

52:58.180 --> 52:59.380
It's the same way that,

52:59.380 --> 53:01.460
all the things that are called studies,

53:01.460 --> 53:04.380
I think everything called studies in the humanities

53:04.380 --> 53:06.940
should be shut down.

53:06.940 --> 53:09.420
Because of the activist element.

53:09.420 --> 53:12.780
They're all activism, gay studies and queer studies.

53:14.580 --> 53:17.420
Nothing good has ever come from it, nothing good.

53:17.420 --> 53:21.380
To push back, is it obvious that activism

53:21.380 --> 53:24.700
is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?

53:24.700 --> 53:26.100
So isn't it-

53:26.100 --> 53:27.860
It's a sign of the death of the discipline.

53:27.860 --> 53:29.820
It's a sign that discipline's over.

53:29.820 --> 53:33.020
But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline

53:33.020 --> 53:36.460
to enact change, positive change in the world?

53:36.460 --> 53:40.500
Or is that for politicians to do

53:40.500 --> 53:43.220
with the findings of science?

53:43.220 --> 53:46.100
I mean, why create an ideology

53:46.100 --> 53:48.220
and then set out to find disciplines

53:48.220 --> 53:49.940
that are weakly put together

53:49.940 --> 53:53.540
to try to back up your political ideology?

53:53.540 --> 53:58.460
So ideology should not be part of science

53:58.460 --> 54:00.380
or of the humanities.

54:00.380 --> 54:01.220
Why would you?

54:03.260 --> 54:04.740
I mean, anyone could do it.

54:05.660 --> 54:09.500
You could decide to go in and be wildly right-wing

54:09.500 --> 54:11.300
about something and only do things

54:11.300 --> 54:13.740
that prove your right-wing ideas.

54:13.740 --> 54:18.380
Be fantastically anti-academic, fantastically anti-science.

54:18.380 --> 54:23.380
It's an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.

54:25.540 --> 54:26.940
And it's absolutely right.

54:27.020 --> 54:28.780
Critical race theory is one of the ones

54:28.780 --> 54:31.700
that completely polluted the academy.

54:31.700 --> 54:34.340
Yeah, and there's been dark moments throughout history,

54:34.340 --> 54:38.060
both during World War II with both communism

54:38.060 --> 54:43.060
and Nazism, fascism that infiltrated science

54:44.380 --> 54:45.900
and then corrupted it.

54:45.900 --> 54:46.740
Yes.

54:46.740 --> 54:49.140
I mean, for instance, also, let's face it,

54:49.140 --> 54:50.580
in science, as in everything else,

54:50.580 --> 54:53.740
there are dark, difficult things.

54:53.740 --> 54:55.140
It's much better we know about them,

54:55.140 --> 54:57.620
face up to them and try to find a way socially

54:57.620 --> 55:00.460
to deal with them than that you leave them

55:00.460 --> 55:02.620
in the hands of some activist

55:02.620 --> 55:04.980
who wants to do stuff with them.

55:04.980 --> 55:07.740
Some of my best friends are activists.

55:07.740 --> 55:09.060
I'm just kidding, okay.

55:09.060 --> 55:11.260
And none of my best friends are activists.

55:11.260 --> 55:12.460
That's how it should be.

55:13.940 --> 55:15.860
Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends,

55:15.860 --> 55:20.860
but okay, now I'm trying to gain some pity points.

55:21.860 --> 55:22.980
Pity points.

55:22.980 --> 55:24.540
Okay, so to return-

55:24.540 --> 55:28.220
You have your clubhouse friend screaming away

55:28.220 --> 55:31.300
like deranged maniacs.

55:31.300 --> 55:32.420
No, I'm anti-clubhouse, by the way,

55:32.420 --> 55:33.660
because the only time I heard it

55:33.660 --> 55:36.380
was that Brett Weinstein one when he did that.

55:36.380 --> 55:38.340
I don't know if you heard that early in clubhouse.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.020
I was invited to clubhouse with various people.

55:40.020 --> 55:41.540
He was, oh, this is a really great, civilized way

55:41.540 --> 55:44.100
to hang out and talk with interesting people.

55:44.100 --> 55:46.580
I downloaded the app and I got on one night

55:46.580 --> 55:48.540
because Brett Weinstein said,

55:48.580 --> 55:50.140
you know, I'm doing this conversation and I listened

55:50.140 --> 55:54.220
and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever heard.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.620
Was it something about biology?

55:55.620 --> 55:59.060
Something about, was it COVID times?

55:59.060 --> 56:01.260
At some point, Brett said,

56:01.260 --> 56:06.260
I'm an evolutionary biologist

56:06.260 --> 56:09.780
and somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist.

56:09.780 --> 56:12.420
And he said, no, I'm an evolutionary biologist.

56:12.420 --> 56:14.980
And somebody else said, that's the same thing.

56:14.980 --> 56:16.580
And it just went on like that.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.020
And Brett desperately tried to explain

56:19.020 --> 56:21.580
that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist.

56:21.580 --> 56:24.060
And he lost the clubhouse room.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.740
They thought that was the same thing.

56:25.740 --> 56:28.500
He'd come, it horribly reminded me of a time

56:28.500 --> 56:30.500
some years ago when a British newspaper

56:30.500 --> 56:33.260
ran a sort of, realizing that the only thing

56:33.260 --> 56:35.180
you can unite people on in sexual ethics

56:35.180 --> 56:37.620
is revulsion against pedophilia,

56:37.620 --> 56:40.020
ran an anti-pedo campaign.

56:40.020 --> 56:43.740
And shortly after, pediatrician's offices

56:43.820 --> 56:46.020
were torched in North of England

56:46.020 --> 56:48.900
by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign.

56:48.900 --> 56:53.020
Yeah, well, to me, like I said,

56:53.020 --> 56:55.420
a little bit of poison is good for the town.

56:55.420 --> 56:57.780
Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you with flattering you

56:57.780 --> 56:58.780
with our people in clubhouse.

56:58.780 --> 57:03.100
I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.

57:06.500 --> 57:09.500
We didn't get to some of the ideas of critical race theory.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.940
What exactly is it?

57:11.940 --> 57:14.460
I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.

57:14.460 --> 57:17.580
Yeah, it's an attempt to look at everything

57:17.580 --> 57:20.220
among other things through the lens of race

57:20.220 --> 57:24.380
and to add race into things where it may not be

57:24.380 --> 57:27.140
as a way of adding, I'm trying to give

57:27.140 --> 57:30.060
the most generous estimation.

57:30.060 --> 57:32.380
To add race in as a conversation in a place

57:32.380 --> 57:35.140
where it may not have been in the conversation.

57:36.940 --> 57:38.620
And that means history too?

57:38.620 --> 57:41.900
The history of racism. Oh, sure, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:42.900 --> 57:44.300
All history and to look at it

57:44.300 --> 57:45.980
through these particular lenses.

57:48.140 --> 57:50.860
I mean, there's a certain, like all these things,

57:50.860 --> 57:51.940
there's a certain logic in it.

57:51.940 --> 57:55.020
Like with feminist studies or something,

57:55.020 --> 57:57.300
I mean, is there a utility in looking back

57:57.300 --> 57:59.900
through undoubtedly male-dominated histories

57:59.900 --> 58:03.660
and asking where the more silent female voice was?

58:03.660 --> 58:06.140
Yes, very interesting.

58:06.140 --> 58:09.780
Not endlessly interesting and can't be put

58:09.780 --> 58:14.780
exactly on the same par as, but it has a utility.

58:16.700 --> 58:18.540
It's that endlessly, sorry to interrupt,

58:18.540 --> 58:20.260
that endlessly part that seems to get us

58:20.260 --> 58:21.620
into trouble. Yes, absolutely.

58:21.620 --> 58:24.340
Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?

58:24.340 --> 58:29.340
And that's always, I talked about this

58:30.380 --> 58:32.140
in my last book, In the Manners of Crowd,

58:32.140 --> 58:35.580
it's one of the big conundrums in activist movements

58:35.580 --> 58:38.500
and particularly in activist academia.

58:38.500 --> 58:39.340
Where would you stop?

58:39.980 --> 58:42.060
It's not clear because you've got a job in it.

58:42.060 --> 58:43.980
You've got a pension in it.

58:43.980 --> 58:48.460
You've got your only esteem in society

58:48.460 --> 58:50.260
is in keeping this gig going.

58:53.300 --> 58:55.700
I mean, is there any likelihood,

58:55.700 --> 58:58.180
have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it?

58:58.180 --> 59:00.100
That, you know, the end of every conference,

59:00.100 --> 59:01.420
the only thing everyone agrees on

59:01.420 --> 59:04.060
is that we must have another conference like this one.

59:05.220 --> 59:07.300
So one thing they always agree on,

59:07.340 --> 59:09.820
this conference is so great, we must have another one.

59:09.820 --> 59:11.340
Well, that's a criticism you could apply

59:11.340 --> 59:12.540
to a lot of disciplines.

59:12.540 --> 59:14.180
Of course. Civil engineering,

59:14.180 --> 59:17.580
bridge building, at a certain point,

59:17.580 --> 59:19.100
do we need any more bridges?

59:19.100 --> 59:20.820
Can we just fly everywhere?

59:22.340 --> 59:26.140
Well, at the very least, you need to keep the bridges up.

59:26.140 --> 59:28.860
Sure, and they would, critical race theory folks

59:28.860 --> 59:30.980
would probably make the same argument

59:30.980 --> 59:33.620
that at the very least, we need to keep the racism out.

59:35.020 --> 59:36.140
We have to make sure we don't descend

59:36.140 --> 59:38.980
into the racism path. It assumes all the time

59:38.980 --> 59:42.300
that we are living on the cusp of the return of the KKK.

59:42.300 --> 59:44.580
Right. Which is totally wrong.

59:44.580 --> 59:46.940
I mean, it's a massive. Well, you say that now

59:46.940 --> 59:49.940
until the KKK armies march in.

59:49.940 --> 59:52.500
We don't always, we can't always predict the future.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.820
We can't always predict the future,

59:53.820 --> 59:58.460
and you can always say you should be careful,

59:58.460 --> 01:00:02.700
but you've also got to be careful of people

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.300
who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong,

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.020
or their estimation of the society they're in.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:12.020
You mean like most of society before in the 1930s

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.180
when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:19.700
Sure they did. And so. Most people.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.700
So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:27.340
Well. Beware of the man with the mustache.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.620
If only it was that easy.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.380
It's not always about facial hair.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.740
I always say that, I mean, what...

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:36.580
Very often is.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.220
These two clean shaven chaps both say.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.220
One of the problems with everybody

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:42.660
knowing a little bit about Nazism

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:47.660
is that they think that they know where evil comes from,

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:52.100
and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.820
getting people to goose step, for instance.

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.300
And that's not correct.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.180
A much better understanding of it is it can come

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:03.100
from all number of directions

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:06.220
and keep your antennae as good as you can.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:09.580
But once you end up in this society,

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.860
which I would argue certainly parts of America in,

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:15.020
where you're always in 1938,

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.900
that's not healthy for a society either.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:21.980
Where people are so primed and think they're so well-trained

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.780
because they spent a term in school

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.100
learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust,

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.900
think they're so well-trained in Hitler spotting

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.980
that they can do it all the time.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:35.300
Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies,

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.500
like dog whistle.

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.140
As I always say, if you hear the whistle, you're the dog.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.340
But people say, that's a dog whistle,

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:46.460
as if they're highly trained anti-Nazis.

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:50.140
I mean, there should be some humility in it.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:50.980
We should be careful.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.780
We should be wary for sure.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:57.220
And we should also be slightly humble

01:01:57.220 --> 01:02:01.580
in our inability to spot everything.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.940
If not significantly humble, right.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.260
So if we can,

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.420
there's something funny if not dark

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.860
about the activity of Hitler spotting,

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.500
if I just may take an aside.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:26.500
But so critical race theory, how much racism,

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.700
what is racism?

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.220
How much of it is in our world today?

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.660
If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting,

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.900
and trying to steel man the case of,

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:41.100
if not critical race theory,

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.780
but people who look for racism in our world,

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:48.100
how much would you say?

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:50.100
Well, it's a good thing to try to define.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:54.900
I'd say that racism is the belief

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.980
that other people are inferior to you.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.140
You could say, you could see a form of it

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.460
where you thought people were superior to you.

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.340
That could also happen.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.620
But more commonly is,

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:07.260
you see a group of people as being inferior to you

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:08.580
simply by dint of the fact

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.300
that they have a different racial background.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:17.380
And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism.

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:22.900
As I say, I mean, there are types of racism,

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:26.820
mainly anti-Semitism actually, perhaps it's the only one,

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:30.860
which weirdly relies on a hatred of people

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:34.660
who a certain type of person thinks are better than them.

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:37.900
And that's a particular peculiarity,

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.180
one of the peculiarities of anti-Semitism.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.820
Well, anti-Semitism somehow does both, right?

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:46.340
Yes, well, one of the eternal fascinating things

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.860
about anti-Semitism is it can do,

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.820
it does everything at the same time.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:52.900
It's like quantum racism.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.740
Yes.

01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:54.980
They're both superior and inferior.

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:58.940
You know that, do you know Vasily Grosvenor's Life and Fate?

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:02.380
So in the middle of Life and Fate,

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.820
which a Persian friend of mine said

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.060
was one of only two great novels of the 20th century,

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:08.020
she was very harsh, literally critic.

01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.060
What was the other one?

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.940
Oh, The Leopard, obviously.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.780
The Leopard?

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.100
The Leopard of Giuseppe de Lampedusa, yeah.

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:14.940
Okay.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.860
She's definitely right on that one.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.700
Life and Fate is a-

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.540
I'm learning so much today, yes.

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:24.540
Life and Fate is an extraordinary book, mainly about,

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.260
well, you know Grosvenor was a, obviously Jewish himself,

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:34.260
but he saw almost everything

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:36.220
that he could have done in the Second World War.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:38.700
He saw Stalingrad, a journalist,

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.020
and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:45.940
He was also the first journalist into Treblinka,

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.180
and his account, which you can read

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.300
in one of the collections of his journalism,

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.260
his account of walking into Treblinka

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:53.260
is just one of the most devastating,

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:56.740
haunting pieces of journalism or prose you can read.

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:58.820
Anyhow, I mention him because Grosvenor,

01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.300
in the middle of Life and Fate,

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:02.300
which is about sort of a 900 page novel,

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.180
in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.620
around Stalingrad,

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.740
he way at one point he amazingly sort of goes

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.780
into the minds of both Hitler and Stalin.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.940
He says, he says Stalin in his study

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:22.820
feels his counterpart in Berlin,

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:26.380
and he says he feels very close to him at this moment.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:29.660
Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the battle.

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.060
After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost,

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:34.180
he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.420
But Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate,

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.500
slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:45.340
suddenly dedicates a chapter to antisemitism.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.660
And I've seen antisemitism is something

01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:51.220
I've always been very interested in,

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:53.620
because I've always had an instinctive,

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.060
utter revulsion of it,

01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:00.180
and also partly because of having seen bits of it

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:02.580
in the Middle East and elsewhere.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.100
But I mention this because Grosvenor,

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.900
in the middle of Life and Fate,

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.980
takes time out and does this like three page explanation.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.900
Three page description of antisemitism,

01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:14.300
and it's extraordinary.

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:16.060
I mean, the only thing I can think of

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.300
that's equally good is

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.900
Gregor von Retsauri,

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:28.820
who wrote a luridly titled but brilliant set of novellas

01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.420
called Confessions of an Antisemite,

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:35.380
and about pre-First World War antisemitism

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:36.700
in Eastern and Central Europe.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:40.900
Anyway, Grosvenor says, in the middle of Life and Fate,

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.820
that one of the extraordinary things about antisemitism

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:47.260
is that it does everything at the same time.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.140
That as Jews get condemned in one place for being rich

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:52.340
and in another for being poor,

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:54.820
condemned in one place for assimilating

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.940
and another for not assimilating,

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.820
for assimilating too much and assimilating too little,

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:05.500
for being too successful for not being successful enough.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.820
I think it's the only racism that includes within it

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.500
a detestation, for the real antisemite,

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.580
a detestation of people that the person may perceive

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:18.980
to be better than them,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.300
correctly or otherwise.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.740
By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:26.620
this one of two greatest novels

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.100
of the 20th century Life and Fate,

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.180
the Zhizni Sibba, and just to read off of Wikipedia,

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.940
we see Grosvenor, Ukrainian Jew became a correspondent

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.740
for the Soviet military paper,

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:38.340
Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.740
and been rejected for military service,

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:43.180
he spent a thousand days in the front lines,

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.580
roughly three of the four years of the conflict

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.020
between the Germans and the Soviets,

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.460
and the main themes covered in,

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.180
how does it go, Life and Fate,

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:55.380
I keep thinking Zhizni Sibba,

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:58.540
is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust,

01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:01.220
Grosvenor's idea of humanity and the human goodness,

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:04.500
Stalin's distortion of reality and values,

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:08.020
and science, life goes on in reality of war.

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.500
It's interesting, I need to definitely-

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.820
You need to read it.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.300
I think you'll really get a lot from it.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:14.700
One of the other things, sorry if I'm referencing it,

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.500
but one of the other things he does is that

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.100
he has this extraordinary ability to talk about

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.860
the absolute highest levels of the conflict,

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:24.900
and then zoom in, it's rather like the camera work

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.740
they use in things like Lord of the Rings,

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:30.340
where he zooms down and then gets one person

01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.900
in the midst of all this, and you get on that.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.180
We'll put you in the study too.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.820
So I personally have read and reread

01:08:36.820 --> 01:08:39.460
the William Shire's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:42.860
who's another journalist who was there,

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.580
but he does not do it.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:49.060
Interestingly enough, given such a large novel,

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.380
kind of the definitive original work

01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.940
that goes to source materials on Hitler,

01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:59.660
he doesn't touch anti-Semitism really.

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.460
Big thing to miss out.

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.860
Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:08.260
as he does for most of the work,

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.260
that this was the fact of life.

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.780
There's a lot of cruelty throughout,

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.220
but he doesn't get to-

01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.820
Well, one of the things is, of course,

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.780
they lost the war because of anti-Semitism.

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:22.500
I mean, that's one kind of important way to view it,

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.420
is how Andrew Roberts and other historians say it,

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.700
is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.940
because they were Nazis.

01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:30.980
It sounds almost too neat,

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:35.660
but it's worth remembering that at the end of the war,

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.740
when the Germans need to be transporting troops

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.620
and they need to be transporting very basic supplies,

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.140
Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:49.180
to transport the Jews right up to the end.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.380
Well, that's certainly a dark possibility.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.820
You know, anyhow, but to go back to racism in general,

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.020
racism in general, apart from anti-Semitism,

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:03.020
relies on the perception that another group of people,

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:07.940
a racial group, other than your own are inferior to you.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:11.220
That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.340
And of course, it's one of the stupidest things

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:17.860
that our species is capable of.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:19.660
I mean, one of the stupidest,

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.340
that you can look at a person and guess them

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.900
in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:31.580
I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is,

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:32.660
as well as being an evil one.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:37.660
But I would say that one of the,

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.900
I think it's a dangerous thing in our era,

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.820
that there are bits of it coming back.

01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:44.820
That's why I say we do need sort of,

01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:48.300
we need our antennae working.

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.420
We just don't need them to be overactive or underactive.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.260
You know.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.460
Now the book is War in the West,

01:10:55.460 --> 01:11:00.260
but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups

01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.460
based on their skin color,

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.340
you've said that there's a war on white people in the US.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.660
Would you say that's the case?

01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:11.700
Would you say that there is significant racism

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.420
towards white people in the United States?

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:15.540
I'd say that the white people in the United States

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540
are the only people who are told

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.020
that they have hereditary sin.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.300
And that's a big one, just to start with.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.140
Based strictly on the color of the skin.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.820
I mean, I would find it so repugnant if,

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.420
and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this,

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.340
I would feel it so repugnant

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.940
if there were any school of thought in America today

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:39.940
that had any grasp on the public attention,

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.420
that said that black people were born into evil

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.540
because of something their ancestors did.

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:50.620
Like they had the mark of Cain upon them.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:55.620
I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way

01:11:55.620 --> 01:12:00.620
to try to demoralize a group of people

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.860
and to tell them that the things they would be able

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.220
to achieve in their lives are much lessened

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.980
because they should spend significant portions

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:10.180
of their lives trying to atone

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.900
for something they didn't do.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:13.980
Is there a difference?

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.380
Is there a difference?

01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.540
And the final point, the obvious point left unsaid,

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.540
but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that,

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.900
and they're the maniacs of the far fringes,

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.260
but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that,

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:34.780
or I think even think that about any group of people

01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.500
other than white people.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.340
And does this mean that white people

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:42.140
are more disadvantaged than black people?

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.020
Well, no, and again, let's not make this a competition,

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.740
but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.420
not to get into the idea of hereditary sin

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.020
according to racial background.

01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:57.220
Is there something to be said about the feature aspect

01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:59.180
to sort of play devil's advocate

01:12:59.180 --> 01:13:04.180
about the asymmetry of sort of accusations

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.380
towards the majority?

01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.300
So, because white-

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:09.300
Yes, of course, it's much easier to attack a majority.

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:11.340
It is much easier, but is there something to be said

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:14.060
about that being a useful function of society

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:15.900
that you always attack,

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:20.540
that the minority has disproportionate power

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:22.100
to attack the majority,

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.860
so that you can always keep the majority in check?

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:28.220
Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it?

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.060
I think-

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:30.500
It's a very dangerous game to play.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.340
That's a good summary of entirety of human civilization.

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.780
Well, yeah, everything's dangerous.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.780
But it's a very dangerous game to play that.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.700
I wrote about this a bit in the matters of crowds

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:43.060
when I was saying, like, gay rights people,

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:44.380
the ones that still exist,

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.340
the ones who don't have homes to go to,

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:51.580
who want to beat up on straight people in a way,

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.980
or want to make straight people feel like they're

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:59.940
kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.380
So boring.

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:06.100
So, not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.780
That's a bad idea to push that one.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:11.700
That's a bad idea.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.500
And some gays push that.

01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:18.980
Highly unwise, given the fact that about

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.020
two to three percent of the population are actually gay,

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.700
although now there's like an additional 20%

01:14:23.700 --> 01:14:25.820
who think they're like two-spirit or something

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:30.820
and all that bullshit, but they're just attention seekers,

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.100
so let's not spend too much time on that.

01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.220
But equally, as I've said,

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:40.620
I said the matters of crowds with the feminist movement,

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.980
very unwise for half of the species to say

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.220
that the other half of the species isn't needed.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.940
And there were always third and fourth-wave feminists

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:52.220
willing to make that nuts argument.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.900
Not first-wave feminists,

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.060
you didn't hear it in first-wave feminists,

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.380
you didn't hear it, suffragettes tended not to say,

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.380
we like the vote and men are scum.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.540
It would've been hard to have won everyone over to their side,

01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:09.180
not least the men they needed to win over to their side.

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.860
But you do get third and fourth-wave feminists

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:14.020
who say like, do we need men?

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:15.500
Or men are all X.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.340
Again, it's a bad idea.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:19.740
It's a bad idea tactically.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:24.500
What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard,

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.620
describes that men are the originators of violence,

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.660
physical violence in society.

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:35.540
And he argues that actually the world would be better off.

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:38.660
No, just a very cold calculus.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.180
If you get rid of men,

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.780
there would be a lot less violence in society,

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:44.300
is his claim.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:47.620
But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?

01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.060
But shouldn't that at least be a discussion?

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:51.660
The pros and cons.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.140
Have a debate, a panel discussion,

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:55.620
violence, pros and cons.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:57.540
Well, that's the sort of thing, if I can say so,

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.980
that some weak-ass academic decides to do

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.580
because he thinks that his area of Boston

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:04.300
would be nicer or whatever.

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.380
He might decide it's useful if he was living in Kiev today

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.260
to have violent men.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:17.980
I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now,

01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:20.580
I'd need some violent men around here.

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:25.740
But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.780
Well, that's the argument.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.020
At least there's some level of threat

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.660
that you ought to exude that puts people off.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.740
If I was in, you know,

01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.380
I'm very glad that the men and women of Ukraine

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.300
are capable of and more than capable of

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.620
fighting for their country

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:49.860
and for their neighbors and their families and much more.

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.700
But it's better that,

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:55.100
that there was violence ready to unleash

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.060
when violence was unleashed upon them

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.980
than that the whole society had been told

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:01.300
that they should identify as non-binary.

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.260
But at least it's a conversation to have, isn't there?

01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.060
Isn't there aspect to the sort of the feminist movement

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:17.020
that is correct in challenging the...

01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.140
Some forms of violence, domestic violence, for instance,

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.020
although women are capable of that as well.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.340
I'm learning about this.

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:26.820
We're all learning about this at the moment.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.220
I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.460
in this beautiful mess that is human relations.

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.300
Okay.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.660
But just to finish up that thought,

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:38.660
it's very unwise for women to war against men,

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.220
as it would be for men to war against women.

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:45.300
It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.740
And in America, Britain and other Western countries,

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.780
white people are still a majority.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.900
And so why would you tell the majority of their evil

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.180
by dint of their skin color

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.700
and think that that would be a good way

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.100
to keep them in check?

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:00.500
I mean, I'm not guilty of anything

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.060
because of my skin color.

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.300
I'm not guilty of anything.

01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.820
My ancestors didn't do anything wrong.

01:18:05.820 --> 01:18:06.700
And even if they had,

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.780
why would I be held responsible for it?

01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:12.100
So to go back to Nietzsche,

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.780
is there some aspect to where,

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:18.300
if we try to explain the forces at play here,

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:22.500
is it the will to power playing itself out

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.020
from individual human nature

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.820
and from group behavior nature?

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.100
Is there some elements to this,

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:32.780
which is the game we play as human beings,

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:34.860
is always when we have less power,

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:36.940
we try to find ways to gain more power?

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.300
That's certainly one.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.820
The desire to grab is,

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.860
let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:49.900
The desire to grab that which we think we're owed

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:54.340
and to do it often in the guise of justice.

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:00.740
I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.780
and one of the very great bogus terms of our age.

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:06.180
People forever talk about their search for justice.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.340
And it's amazing how violent they can often be

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.620
in their search for justice

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.900
and how many rules they're willing to break

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:14.220
so long as they can say that they're after justice

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.260
and how many norms they can trample

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.540
so long as they can say it's in the name of justice.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:21.460
You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.700
Well, the majority groups throughout history,

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.620
including those with white skin color,

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:28.260
have done the same in the name of justice.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:31.100
We come up with all kinds of sexy terms

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.260
in our propaganda machines to sell

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.500
whatever atrocities we'd like to commit.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:40.100
One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked,

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.180
and I quoted in this-

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.060
Careful, I'm judging you harshly.

01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:43.900
Yeah, of course.

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:49.740
Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.980
is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge,

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.940
which is to turn happy people into unhappy people

01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:58.500
like themselves, to shove their misery

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.740
in the faces of the happy so that in due course,

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.660
the happy, and this is quoting Nietzsche,

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.260
start to be ashamed of their happiness

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:06.860
and perhaps say to one another,

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.900
it's a disgrace to be happy.

01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.060
There is too much misery.

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.220
This is something to be averted.

01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:16.060
For the sick says Nietzsche must not make the healthy sick too

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.140
or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:24.180
Well, I think that again, there's a lot of that going on.

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:27.140
How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world?

01:20:27.140 --> 01:20:29.740
Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:34.220
I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.060
Sure.

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.380
Notes from Underground.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:37.220
Okay.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.660
This has been very Russian, Russian focus.

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.540
I'm very pleased with the number of times

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:46.420
but Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in.

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.100
I wasn't doing this as a sort of...

01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.980
Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:56.140
and good to know they're still relevant.

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.860
Do you speak Russian by the way at all?

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:00.860
Which I did.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.020
I'm told it's a 10 year language basically

01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:06.100
to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:09.620
Well, there's the language and then there's the personality

01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:11.340
behind the language and the personality.

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:12.940
I feel like you already have.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.060
So you just need to know the surface details.

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.460
Okay.

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.780
In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language

01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.780
is something that's already important.

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.940
Oh, I should, if we had a moment,

01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:28.100
I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:28.940
Should I tell you that?

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:29.780
No.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.900
I once went to Gori where Stalin was born.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:33.900
Have you been?

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:34.740
No, no.

01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:36.540
I was there just after the Georgia war.

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.420
And I went to the no man's land

01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.460
in the south of Sertia and Abkhazia.

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:47.340
And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.460
because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:50.580
from the Russian side.

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:53.300
And Gori is where Stalin was born.

01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.580
And of course Gori is in Georgia.

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.460
And anyhow, the museum of Stalin's birthplace,

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:01.660
they'd been trying to change for some years

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:06.660
because it had been unadulteratedly pro-Stalin for years.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:07.780
And the Georgian authorities,

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:11.780
this is in Jack Ashvili's time,

01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.740
were trying to make it into a museum of Stalinism.

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.420
And it was really tough.

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:19.020
The only place I've seen which is similar

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:22.020
is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed.

01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.660
That also is like, they're not quite sure what to do.

01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:27.980
They don't want to say he's a bad guy

01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:29.300
because they think that people won't come.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:32.460
Anyhow, Stalin's house in Gori had changed

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.220
from the museum of Stalin to the museum of Stalinism.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.220
And there was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil

01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:40.740
who had clearly been doing the tour for 50 years.

01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.940
And just pointed all the facts.

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:43.020
She did that classic thing.

01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.820
I've also sort of saw it once in North Korea

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.780
where they sort of, that sort of communist thing

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.540
where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.860
by 13 feet deep.

01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.900
And they give you lots of facts.

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.020
I don't care.

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:56.620
Why does it matter?

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:58.780
They always give you facts.

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.220
This is Stalin's suitcase.

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:04.620
It is 13 inches wide by, you know.

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:06.740
Anyhow, and this woman did all of this.

01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.580
And it was all just wildly pro, not pro-Stalinist,

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.660
just explained Stalin's life.

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.780
It was just a great local boy done good.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.620
They didn't mention the fact

01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:17.180
he killed more Georgians per capita than anyone else.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:18.780
Local boy done good.

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.380
And we get to the end.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.260
And before being taken to the gift shop

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.700
where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it,

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:30.260
and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it,

01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:35.260
they took you to a little room under the stairs

01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:38.980
and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.980
to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:45.780
Now, gift shop.

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.540
As I said, there's no, no kind of,

01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.780
and I took the woman aside at the end.

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:52.540
I discovered she'd said this to other journalists

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:53.780
and visited before.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.940
I took her aside and said,

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:57.860
I said, what do you think about communist Stalin?

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:01.100
And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this

01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.500
during communist times.

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.700
She said, it's not my place to judge, that sort of thing.

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:10.780
We had an interesting comment in itself.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:13.740
I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone,

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:15.180
and all that sort of thing.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.980
And she said, it's not my place to judge

01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:19.020
or to give my views, that sort of thing.

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:22.340
And eventually I said, but what do you feel about it?

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:26.620
And she said, it was like a hurricane.

01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:27.460
It happened.

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.380
That's interesting because if I may mention

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:34.060
at the clubhouse once again,

01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.740
I got a chance to talk to a few people from Mongolia.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.980
There's a woman from Mongolia,

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.660
and they talked about the fact

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:43.500
that they deeply admire Stalin, love.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.500
She sounded, if I may,

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:46.940
hopefully that's not crossing the line.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.980
I think I'm representing her correctly

01:24:48.980 --> 01:24:51.820
in saying she admired him almost like,

01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:56.420
like loved him, like the way people love,

01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:00.100
like Jesus, like a holy figure.

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.860
But isn't that still the case in life of Russia?

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.100
I mean, Stalin keeps on winning greatest Russian of all time.

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:10.340
And that's perhaps, maybe there's a dip,

01:25:10.340 --> 01:25:12.940
but if we were to think about the long arc of history,

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:16.260
perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up.

01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:18.580
There's something about human memory

01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:22.100
that you forget the details of the atrocities of the past

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:22.940
and remember the-

01:25:22.940 --> 01:25:25.100
I mean, think of the number of people we talk about

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.620
as historical heroes, Napoleon.

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.460
I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero,

01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:31.500
but the French.

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.700
Now you're-

01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.740
You did the thing with Dostoevsky, now again-

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.180
Now you're on tricky ground.

01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:40.540
But no, but like the French,

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:42.140
I was enormously in love with Napoleon,

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:44.340
and they had many admiral aspects of him.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.340
He was also an unbelievable brute

01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.380
and killed many people unnecessarily.

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.780
And there are lots of figures from history

01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.020
that we sort of cover that over with.

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:56.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.220
Can we mention Churchill briefly?

01:25:58.220 --> 01:25:59.060
Sure.

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.500
Because he is one of the,

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:06.140
you can make a case for him being one of the great

01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.420
representatives or great figures historically

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.940
of the Western civilization.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:10.780
Yes.

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.980
And then there's a lot of people from, not a lot.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:16.660
I know, I have like three friends,

01:26:16.660 --> 01:26:19.420
and one of them happens to be from London,

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.660
and they say that he's a,

01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:23.900
not a good person.

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:24.740
Why?

01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:27.900
So listen, this friend, we did not discuss,

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.580
this is an opinion poll of the three friends,

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.820
but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know-

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.540
There's a backlash going on at the moment.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.900
At the moment, and in general, there's a spirit

01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:39.700
like reflecting on the darker sides

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.140
of some of these historical figures,

01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.740
like challenging history through,

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:45.860
it's not just critical race theory,

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.860
it's challenging history through the past.

01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:56.660
History through, well, are the people we think of as heroes,

01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:01.300
what are their flaws, and are they in fact villains

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:06.300
that are convenient, sort of,

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:08.540
were there at the right time

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.020
to accidentally do the right thing?

01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.100
Accidentally.

01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:19.460
I hope this isn't the representative, fair estimation

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.220
of your friend in London's views.

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.660
She's going to be quite mad at this,

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.180
but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friend,

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:27.020
it could be-

01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.860
But we know it's a she.

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:28.740
It's my girlfriend in Canada.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:30.580
Well, see, I-

01:27:30.580 --> 01:27:31.740
You've given that away.

01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:34.900
Well, that's, of course I would not,

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.140
I made that up completely.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.660
It's all, just like my girlfriend in Canada,

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.780
she's completely a figment of my imagination.

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:46.300
Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody,

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.140
I mean, just looking at reading

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:49.340
The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:53.540
is an incredible figure, that to me,

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:59.460
so much of World War II is marked, leading up to the war,

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.940
is marked by stunning amounts of cowardice

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:06.100
by political leaders, and it's fascinating to watch,

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:09.740
hear this person clearly with the drinking

01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:11.860
and a smoking problem.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.980
Well, boss, I don't understand why that's a negative.

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.700
No, I didn't say, you see-

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.860
Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:19.700
No, well, it's called humor.

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.460
I'll explain it to you one day what that means.

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.300
But he stood-

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.980
Yeah, I haven't explained dry humor.

01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.900
He stood up.

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:31.900
He stood up to what we now see as evil,

01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.860
when at the time it was not so obvious to see.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.820
You know, so that's just a fascinating figure

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:40.780
of Western civilization.

01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:42.220
I'd love to get your comments.

01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:43.300
The real criticisms,

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:45.380
I mean, up and smoking and drinking.

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.220
The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up,

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.900
and I do so in the war in the West, actually.

01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:54.100
I say these are the things that they now use against him.

01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.900
Didn't do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943,

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.620
for instance, that's been shot down by numerous historians,

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:01.700
including Indian historians.

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:04.180
In the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war,

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.940
Churchill did what he could to get grain supplies diverted

01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:10.380
from Australia to Bengal.

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.860
The famine was appalling.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:15.060
It was caused by a typhoon.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.700
It was not caused by Winston Churchill.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:22.700
And the idea that some basically Indian nationalist

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:25.420
historians have pumped out in recent years,

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.100
and just anti-Churchill figures,

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:31.060
that he actually wanted Indians to die

01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.340
is just total calumny.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.220
And when people claim, some people claim that,

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.180
I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars,

01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:41.780
nevertheless with some credentials,

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.980
who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population

01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.260
to basically be genocided.

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:48.540
And it's complete nonsense,

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:51.260
not least by the fact that during the period,

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:54.660
which in question, Indian population boomed.

01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:59.700
So that's one of the main ones.

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:02.140
Another one is that he had some views

01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.460
that we now have regarded as racist.

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.700
He definitely regarded races

01:30:04.700 --> 01:30:07.020
as being of different characters,

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:10.300
and that there were superior races,

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:15.220
and as it were, the white European was a superior culture.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.820
He was born in Victorian England.

01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.620
So he had some Victorian attitudes.

01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.180
These are things in the negative side of the ledger.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.740
And as with all history,

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:30.580
you should have a negative

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:31.940
and a positive side of the ledger.

01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.260
Positive side of the ledger includes,

01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:35.260
he almost certainly did more than any one human being

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:37.300
to save the world from Nazism.

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.500
So that should count as something.

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.260
And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill

01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:45.220
in this regard is to stress that if you get,

01:30:46.140 --> 01:30:49.620
I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.

01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:51.740
I don't think the revisionism of recent years

01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:53.980
about Churchill or the founding fathers of America

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:56.980
or anyone else is anything I want to stop.

01:30:56.980 --> 01:30:58.260
I find it interesting.

01:30:58.260 --> 01:30:59.220
I find it interesting not least

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.540
because it's so sloppy on occasions,

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:02.260
but I find it interesting and it's important.

01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.740
And we should be able to see people in the round.

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:08.380
But that includes recognizing

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.540
the positive side of the ledger.

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:13.780
And if you can't recognize that side,

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:15.780
you're doing something else.

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.020
You're doing something else.

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:18.620
It's not history.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:23.420
It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind.

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:26.100
And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.260
There are some people, for instance,

01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:28.660
certainly since the nineties,

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.860
who have pushed the Sally Hemings, Thomas Jefferson story

01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:35.580
to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:40.340
As a result, we see Jefferson's stature being removed

01:31:40.340 --> 01:31:42.620
from the council chamber of the city we're sitting in

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:44.980
last November by council members who said

01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:47.660
that Thomas Jefferson no longer represents our values.

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:51.500
If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:53.260
and that he had flaws,

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:58.620
I mean, that's not a grownup debate.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.420
And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time.

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:05.940
But let me sort of throw a curve ball at you then.

01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:09.380
What about recognizing the positive and the negative

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:13.100
of a fellow with nice facial hair called Karl Marx?

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.460
Sure, sure.

01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:17.940
I mean, I have a section in The War in the West,

01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:20.540
as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee.

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.420
So he seems to have gotten some popularity

01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:29.100
in the West recently.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:30.700
Not just recently, yeah.

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:32.780
I mean, he's had a resurgence recently.

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.900
Yes, resurgence recently.

01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.980
Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong,

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:39.860
people reach for other options.

01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:41.860
And when, for instance,

01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.740
it's very hard for people to accumulate capital,

01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:46.700
it's not obvious that they're gonna become capitalists.

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.140
And so one thing that happens is people say,

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.660
let's look at the Marxism thing again

01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.860
and see if that's a viable goer.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:55.660
And my argument would simply be,

01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:58.420
point me to one place that's worked.

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.540
Well, the argument from the Marxists

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.060
or the Marxian economists is that

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.580
we've only really tried it once, the Soviets tried it.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.460
And then if there's a few people

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.380
that kind of tried the Soviet thing.

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:13.780
Cuba tried it?

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:18.220
Well, they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet.

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:19.540
Yes, they've tried it.

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:20.940
They tried it in Venezuela.

01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:23.420
Yes, yes, yes.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:25.780
So let's just quickly say,

01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:27.700
how did all these experiments go?

01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:31.180
They did not, well, they failed in fascinating ways.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.660
They did, but they failed.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:33.500
Yes, they failed.

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.860
And we should stress, so grossly failed.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.380
So grossly failed that they threw millions

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:43.940
and millions of people into completely thwarted lives

01:33:43.940 --> 01:33:47.260
that were much shorter than they should have been.

01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:50.660
Yeah, so the lesson to learn there,

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.260
that you can learn several lessons.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:56.180
One is that anything that smells like Marxism

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.900
is going to lead to a lot of problems.

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.140
Now, another lesson could be,

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.980
well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.420
He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:13.420
So is it possible to do better than capitalism?

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.740
And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder,

01:34:16.740 --> 01:34:19.220
that might actually become relevant in, I don't know,

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:24.220
20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.780
more and more of the labor,

01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.620
all those kinds of things, you start to ask questions.

01:34:27.620 --> 01:34:29.900
We finally might get to Marx's dream

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.860
of what the average day would look like.

01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:32.700
Yes.

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.020
Well, there's going to be an awful lot

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.460
of literary criticism then.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:39.740
If you remember, that's what Marx said

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.260
that we would be doing in the evenings,

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.580
the laborer in the evening.

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:45.340
Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing or Netflix,

01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.740
so he would change.

01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.100
Are there things we could learn from Marx?

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.780
Plausibly, possibly.

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.860
I can't think of anything myself offhand.

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.820
But to have a critique of capitalism

01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:58.980
isn't by any means a bad thing in the society.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.780
I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.820
that showed how you improve capitalism,

01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:04.580
a critique of free market that showed

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:07.380
how people could get better access to the free market,

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:08.700
how you could ensure, for instance,

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:10.700
that young people get onto the property ladder,

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:11.940
things like that.

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:13.140
Those are constructive things.

01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:15.260
So people who say we must have Marxism,

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.340
I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about,

01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.900
because that never leads to any of those things.

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.020
Haven't led in the past.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.020
It's never led in the past.

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.940
And at some point, you've got to try to work out

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.260
how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:32.060
before you realize that every attempt

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:34.220
always leads to the same thing.

01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:36.340
I would say we could pretend that fascism

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.140
has never been properly tried

01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:43.500
and that it was unfortunate what happened in Nazi Germany,

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.780
but that wasn't real fascism.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:49.540
And in Mussolini's fascism, it didn't go all that well,

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.300
but it was a bit better,

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.500
and maybe we could try a bit more Franco-fascism.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:58.660
Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:02.140
The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly.

01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.660
So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?

01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.780
And it's a great mystery to me

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.740
the way that people do tolerate it.

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:11.860
Always, always in this stupid way of saying,

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:13.940
we haven't done it yet.

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.220
If you keep trying the same recipe,

01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:19.140
and every time it comes out as shit,

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.260
it's that the recipe is shit.

01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.460
I'm trying to practice here by playing devil's advocate,

01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.460
practice the same idea that you mentioned,

01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:29.340
which is when you say the word Marxism,

01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:30.700
should you throw out everything,

01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.660
or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here?

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.460
And the same, it's the good,

01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:37.780
it's weighing the good and the bad,

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.660
and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.

01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:41.820
Sure.

01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:45.580
Do you know the famous George Orwell comment

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.660
on the Stalinist, do you know?

01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:51.380
That's one of my favorite quotes.

01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:52.820
George Orwell in the early 40s

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:55.900
gets into an argument with a Stalinist.

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.140
He's obviously a Marxist.

01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.900
And this is after the Show Trials, 37.

01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.500
This is when it's very clear

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.940
what Marxism in the Russian form is.

01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:15.220
And Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist,

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.980
and it goes on and on, and eventually Orwell says,

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:20.540
what about the Show Trials,

01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.020
and what about what's happened in Ukraine,

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:26.500
and the famines, and much more,

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.140
and the purges, and the purges, and the purges.

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:33.020
And eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.460
what Orwell knows he's going to say all along,

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:37.500
which is he says, you can't make an omelet

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.300
without breaking eggs.

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.860
And Orwell says, where's the omelet?

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.100
Oh yeah.

01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.180
That's a really good...

01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:52.540
Look at this by this stage, okay?

01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:53.380
How many...

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:54.620
Where's my damn omelet?

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:59.620
How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:04.060
have the Marxists created by now in country after country?

01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:08.780
Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet,

01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.460
but they never have, and they never will,

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.620
because the whole thing is rotten from the start.

01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.580
But let me just also say one thing about,

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:20.740
because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds,

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:21.780
and that's one of the things

01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:23.700
that I tried to highlight in the book,

01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:26.020
is if we're going to do this reductive thing

01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:26.980
of people in history and saying,

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:29.540
well, they had views that were of their time,

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:32.060
and we must therefore condemn them for them.

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:34.220
So fine, let's do the same thing with Marx.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:35.780
And there are things I quote in this book

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:38.460
from Marx's letters, not least the letters to Engels,

01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:40.780
and indeed in his published writings,

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:43.100
in part he was writing for the American press

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.020
in the 1850s.

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:49.940
The way he has horrible views on slavery

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:52.980
and colonialism and much more.

01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.740
But the main thing is, I mean,

01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:57.660
the horrible things he says about black people

01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.420
and the constant use of the N-word.

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.740
In fact, when I was doing the audio book

01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.340
for The Wall in the West, I had to decide,

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:05.700
will I read out the quotes from Marx or not?

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:08.860
If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.180
because people would have just said,

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:14.380
you've been using the N-word so much in this passage.

01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.660
And I slightly thought of doing it

01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:20.620
so that I could say I was only quoting Marx

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.420
to try to hit the point home.

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.260
In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to,

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:27.540
but Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms.

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.380
Since I highlighted this in this book

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:31.380
and some of the media picked it up

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.780
and have popularized this thing

01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:37.340
I'm trying to put into the system,

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.420
which is if you're going to accuse Churchill of racism,

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.580
if you're going to accuse Jefferson of racism,

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:44.260
Washington of racism, and so on, what about Marx?

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:47.340
The two things that Marxists have said since this came out

01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.100
has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx?

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:55.100
He was a man of his time, like everyone else.

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.620
And the second thing they say is we don't go to Marx

01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:59.700
for his horrible abhorrent views on race.

01:39:59.700 --> 01:40:01.100
They're talking about mixed race people

01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:02.500
as gorillas and so on.

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.100
We don't go to him for that.

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:07.380
We go to him for his economic theories.

01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:10.900
I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.580
for his views on slaves.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:18.820
We don't go to Churchill for the precise language

01:40:18.820 --> 01:40:21.460
he used that points in the 1910s about Indians.

01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:22.820
Or his health advice.

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:24.660
Or his health advice.

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.020
Actually, I do get him for that.

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.660
But- That explains so much.

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:31.820
But let's have some standards on this.

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:34.380
And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.140
that the people don't do this with Marx

01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:38.420
because I think what some people are trying to do,

01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.100
and this may sound conspiratorial,

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.540
but I really don't think it is.

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.580
I think that some people are deliberately trying

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:47.260
to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.700
in order to say there's nothing good,

01:40:49.700 --> 01:40:51.140
nothing you can hold onto.

01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:52.380
No one you should revere.

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.860
You've got no heroes.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.220
The whole thing comes down.

01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:56.260
Who's left standing?

01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.500
Oh, we've also got this idea

01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:00.540
from the 20th century still about Marxism.

01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.580
Well, the 19th and 20th centuries.

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.380
And no, no.

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:09.780
You will not have the entire landscape deracinated

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:13.100
and then the worst ideas tried again.

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:15.140
So basically destroy all of history

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:16.620
and the lessons learned from history

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.900
and then start from scratch

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:20.780
and then it's completely any idea can work

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.380
and then you could just take whatever.

01:41:22.380 --> 01:41:24.420
Well, and the thing is there are always some people

01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:25.980
with pre-prepared ideas.

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:28.020
And I mentioned this also with the post-colonialists.

01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:30.700
The post-colonialists were really interesting

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:33.340
because when the European powers were moving

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.860
from Africa in the Far East,

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:38.780
post-colonial movements had one obvious move

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:41.380
they could have done, which was to say,

01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.300
since the European powers have left,

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.460
we will return to a pretty colonial life,

01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.340
which in some of their places would have been returning

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.660
to slave markets and slave ownership

01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:52.500
and slave selling and much more.

01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:54.340
But put that aside for a second.

01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:56.340
They could have said, we have an indigenous culture

01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.140
which we will return to.

01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:01.140
Almost uniformly in the post-colonial era,

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:04.140
you had figures like France Fanon,

01:42:04.140 --> 01:42:06.620
you had European intellectuals like Sartre

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:09.820
who said the Western powers are retreating

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.180
from these countries and therefore we should institute

01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.980
in these countries what but Western Marxism.

01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:20.020
Well, it's not obvious to me that the bad ideas

01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:21.340
will be the ones that emerge,

01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:23.700
but it's more likely that the bad ideas would emerge

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:26.580
in this kind of context when you erase history,

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:27.420
when you erase tradition.

01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:30.340
When you erase history and you leave some ideas

01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:33.540
deliberately un-interrogated.

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:38.540
I mean, as I say, find me one in 100 American students

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:44.020
who've heard of any of the communist despots

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.460
of the 20th century.

01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:50.260
I mean, name recognition in, there was a poll done

01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:53.940
a few years ago in the UK and like name recognition

01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:58.940
among children, school children for Stalin,

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:02.060
let alone Mao.

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:05.780
I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone,

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:09.500
65 million Chinese perhaps.

01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:13.100
How many students in America know what Mao was,

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.460
who he was, where he was, nothing.

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:17.900
Or the atrocities committed.

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.340
Where the atrocities were committed.

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:20.500
Or. And I worry about that

01:43:20.500 --> 01:43:23.580
because it means that we might have learned one

01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.100
of the two lessons of the 20th century.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:29.420
We think we've learned one of the two lessons

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.660
of the 20th century, we actually haven't learned

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.820
that lesson, we've learned a little bit of it

01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:35.860
and we've not learned the other one at all

01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.740
because that's why we still have people

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.380
in American politics and elsewhere actually talking

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:42.820
about collectivization and things

01:43:42.820 --> 01:43:44.820
as if there's no problem with that

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:47.580
and as if it's perfectly obvious and they could run it

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:49.620
and they'd know exactly where to start.

01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.500
What are the two lessons of the 20th century?

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.780
Fascism and communism.

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.860
Yeah, I mean, I'm not exactly sure

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:00.980
what exactly the lessons are.

01:44:00.980 --> 01:44:02.060
No, it's not clear.

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.940
If the lessons were very clear, it would be better at it.

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:08.260
Well, one is your book broadly applied

01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:10.580
of madness of crowds.

01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.660
That's one lesson.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:14.060
How so?

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:19.060
Meaning like large crowds can display herd-like behavior.

01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:21.260
Yes, be very suspicious of crowd.

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:24.100
Yeah, in general, I mean, you apply it in different,

01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:26.460
more to modern application in a sense,

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:30.860
but that's rooted in history that crowds can,

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:32.460
when humans get together,

01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:35.540
they can do some quite radically silly things.

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:38.300
Elias Canetti is very good on that, crowds and power.

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:43.140
And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self-taught,

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:47.940
amazing, not to say autodidactic writer,

01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:49.220
the true believer and so on.

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.460
He was extremely good on that.

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:52.780
But the reason I mentioned the two things,

01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:53.900
no, I mean, we should have realized

01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.700
the two nightmares of the 20th century,

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.580
fascism and communism,

01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:00.060
that we should know how they came about.

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.220
And we're interested in learning

01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:03.180
how one of them came about, fascism.

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:04.780
And we know some of the lessons,

01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:08.340
like don't treat other people as less than you

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.180
because of their race.

01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:12.140
That's one lesson.

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:16.260
But we've done some good at learning that.

01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:20.580
But the second one, not to do communism again,

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:22.100
not to do socialism,

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:26.540
I think we're way away from knowing,

01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:29.500
because we don't know how it happened.

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:32.620
And the little temptations are still there always.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:33.460
Look at the people saying,

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.700
I'm gonna expropriate your property.

01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.500
If people do things they don't like,

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.940
they will get, we can't wait to take your property.

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:45.780
Well, there's a sense, there's an appealing sense.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:50.940
Okay, every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:52.540
that sells the ideology.

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:57.180
So for socialism, for communism is that there's a,

01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:01.700
it seems unfair that the working class does all of this work

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:05.140
and gets only a fraction of the output.

01:46:05.140 --> 01:46:07.100
It just seems unfair.

01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:07.940
So you want to make it-

01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:10.220
If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.

01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.380
Yes.

01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:16.300
And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that.

01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:21.300
If the workers own all of the value of their output

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:26.500
and things that are more fair seems to be a good thing.

01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:27.660
I'd say, well, yeah.

01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:32.420
I mean, fairness is, I like fairness as a term.

01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.780
No, I much prefer fairness

01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:36.860
because it's a much easier thing to try to work out.

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.620
It's quite amorphous itself as a concept,

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:40.780
but everyone can recognize it.

01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.620
So for instance,

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:49.460
should the boss of the company earn a million times

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:51.260
that of the lowest paid employee?

01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:52.300
Doesn't seem fair.

01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:57.300
Should they earn maybe five or 10 times

01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.140
the salary of the lowest paid employee?

01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:01.220
Yeah, possibly.

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:02.940
That could be fair.

01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:04.620
There are certain sort of multiples

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:09.620
which are within the bounds of, you know, reasonableness.

01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:16.620
I think actually that's the much bigger problem

01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:18.740
in capitalism at the moment as I see it,

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:22.820
is the not untrue perception

01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:27.820
that a tiny number of people accrue a lot of the benefits

01:47:28.700 --> 01:47:31.700
and that the bit in the middle

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:37.820
has become increasingly squeezed

01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.540
and is at danger always of falling

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:40.980
all the way down to the bottom.

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.420
I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:44.100
of American capitalism, for instance,

01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:47.220
it's a correct perception to say

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.260
that the snakes go down awfully far.

01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.620
If you tread on the snake,

01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:57.420
you can plummet an awfully long way in America.

01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:03.340
And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high.

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:07.500
And there's a perception, and again, it's not entirely wrong,

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:10.420
that the ladders system on the board is kind of broken.

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:14.940
So what you're saying is you're a Marxist.

01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:16.860
I'm not saying I'm a Marxist.

01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:21.900
You heard that here first in the out-of-context blog post

01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:22.900
you're going to write about this.

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:24.260
I get practice point.

01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:27.540
The way to critique capitalism, if it's gone bad,

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:29.500
is to get better capitalists.

01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:32.780
Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair.

01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:36.420
Never decide that the answer is the thing

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:41.020
that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism.

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:43.300
So as you describe in the Madness of Crowds,

01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.540
the herd-like behavior of humans

01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.100
that gets us into trouble,

01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:53.220
you as an individual thinker and others listening to this,

01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:55.940
how can you, because all of us are mid crowds,

01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.740
we're influenced by the society that's around us,

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:00.060
by the people that's around us.

01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:01.660
How can we think independently?

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:07.580
How can we, if you're in the Soviet Union

01:49:10.380 --> 01:49:12.340
at the beginning of the 20th century,

01:49:13.220 --> 01:49:17.900
if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany

01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:19.780
at the end of the 30s and 40s,

01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:21.460
how can you think independently?

01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:26.860
Given, first of all, that it's hard to think independently,

01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:28.540
just intellectually speaking,

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:33.540
but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous.

01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:36.780
So the incentive to think independently

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:39.620
under the uncertainty that's usually involved

01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:42.860
with the thinking is, I mean, it's a silly thing to say,

01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:46.420
but on Twitter, there's a cost to be paid for going

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:49.580
against the crowd on any silly thing.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:52.900
Well, we can even talk about, what is it,

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:55.620
Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:59.020
There's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.700
I forget what the crowd decided.

01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:02.740
Crowd split on that one.

01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.620
It's safe to have one opinion either way.

01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:05.620
Okay, it is, right.

01:50:05.620 --> 01:50:07.940
But there is, you put it very nicely,

01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.300
that there's clearly a calculus here

01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:12.660
and that you can measure, on Twitter in particular,

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:14.420
you can measure kind of the crowd,

01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:16.140
a sense of where the crowd lays.

01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.140
Michael Jackson.

01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:20.700
Well, oh boy.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.140
I don't want to, this is not a legal discussion.

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.020
I don't have my lawyer present.

01:50:28.020 --> 01:50:29.100
I don't even have a lawyer.

01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:30.540
The man in question is dead.

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:33.900
But I think most people who are not just diehard fans

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.060
would concede that Michael Jackson

01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.060
had a strange relationship with children.

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:40.940
And was almost certainly a pedophile.

01:50:42.140 --> 01:50:45.220
Is that, was that, did the crowd agree on that?

01:50:45.220 --> 01:50:47.100
No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:48.540
and we all love thriller.

01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:49.620
Yeah, we do.

01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:52.540
So you said people who are not fans, I just don't.

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:53.980
No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson,

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.700
but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.

01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:01.580
And, but nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.

01:51:01.580 --> 01:51:04.980
So they just kind of added in, it's fine.

01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:06.700
Seriously, it's a genius.

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:10.660
But see, your law does not apply to Bill Cosby.

01:51:12.020 --> 01:51:14.660
Well, he wasn't, he was, of course,

01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:16.660
one of the most famous people in America,

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:19.580
but maybe he wasn't regarded as talented.

01:51:19.580 --> 01:51:22.780
Oh, wow, there's depth to this calculation.

01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.100
There's a genius opt-out in all cultures.

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.540
There's a genius opt-out in all cultures.

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.580
Look at Lord Byron.

01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.020
Lord Byron shagged his sister.

01:51:31.340 --> 01:51:32.780
Doesn't affect his reputation.

01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:34.900
In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.

01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.420
But then again, this kind of war against the West,

01:51:38.420 --> 01:51:42.300
geniuses actually makes you more likely, or no,

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.820
to get canceled.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:47.780
So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson, or...

01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:49.580
Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything,

01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.020
remarkable, nobody will come looking for you, possibly.

01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:56.060
Oh, so genius can get you in trouble eventually.

01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:58.060
Sidle through life that nobody noticing.

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.540
Be totally harmless, and then die,

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:02.860
and hope you haven't used any carbon.

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:08.980
But you were asking about how to survive

01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:13.180
the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds,

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:15.500
and there's a very simple answer to that.

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:20.500
Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world.

01:52:22.180 --> 01:52:25.260
Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology,

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:26.260
because you want to fit in.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.420
You want to...

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:28.860
Why?

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.860
Because you like people, and this is a...

01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:33.460
Why not just like a small number of people

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.700
and ignore the rest?

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.260
That's what I do.

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:39.620
Well, I mean, I actually like most people,

01:52:39.620 --> 01:52:40.660
and this isn't a general thing.

01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:44.340
I don't have detestation for most people at all.

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:48.380
Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with.

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:52.420
But in terms of storing your sense of self-worth

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.860
in absolute strangers, big mistake.

01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.900
Yeah, well, me, that's...

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.940
Listen, let's turn into a therapy session,

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:01.100
because for me, and I think I represent

01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:03.860
some number of population, is I'm pretty self-critical.

01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.980
I'm looking for myself in the world,

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:08.980
and there is a depth of connection

01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:10.740
with people on the internet.

01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.580
I mean, I have some...

01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:13.260
I think there's a shallowness of it.

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:15.140
It's shallow connection, interesting.

01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:15.980
I...

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:19.260
Put it this way, if you became very ill tomorrow,

01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:20.980
would any of them help?

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:21.820
On the internet?

01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:22.640
No, no.

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.100
Good, that's a good test.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:25.060
Yeah, that's a good test.

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:27.780
But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right.

01:53:27.780 --> 01:53:30.420
Your very close friends would help, family would help, yeah.

01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:31.460
Yeah.

01:53:31.460 --> 01:53:32.860
Perhaps that's the only thing...

01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:38.580
You can't store significant amounts of trust

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:43.180
or faith or belief or self-worth

01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:45.660
in places which will not return it to you.

01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:49.200
Okay, so let's talk about the more extreme case,

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.040
the harsher case.

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.660
When you talk about the things you talk about in the war

01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:57.920
on the West and madness of crowds,

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:01.380
I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure.

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:07.300
As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:09.420
with a zen-like look on your face.

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:12.180
So you don't...

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.820
All you need is Sam Harris to say

01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:16.820
that you're brilliant and you're happy.

01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:19.580
No, I'm very...

01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.420
I love Sam.

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:21.260
Yeah.

01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:23.060
I'm deeply pleased when he flatters me,

01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.980
but I mean, and he's nice about me,

01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:26.580
but no, I don't just rely on Sam.

01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:28.900
No, I mean, I...

01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:31.740
Why would I mind?

01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:34.180
I mean, maybe it's self-selecting.

01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.980
If I didn't have the view I had about that

01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.780
or whatever armory it is that I have on that,

01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:42.460
I wouldn't do what I did, maybe.

01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.900
I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically

01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:48.980
because of the challenging ideas you explore?

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:52.180
So like significant self-doubt, just kind of...

01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:55.460
I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life.

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:58.460
By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind.

01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:01.540
There's definitely two times I've got things wrong

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.660
and regretted that.

01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.420
There's times I've...

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:12.220
There was a period around the time I wrote my book,

01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:14.620
The Strange Death of Europe, which

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:19.700
was a very, very dark time.

01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:23.740
And it wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life,

01:55:23.740 --> 01:55:25.740
but because of the book I was writing.

01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:27.820
Oh, because of the places you've been to?

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:32.260
Because of the places you had to go in order to write a book.

01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:35.580
And well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:40.580
So occasionally now I have maybe slightly too pat at this stage,

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:44.060
but sometimes readers come up to me in the street

01:55:44.060 --> 01:55:47.820
or whatever and say, I love The Strange Death of Europe

01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:51.780
and will say, it's a very depressing book to read, however.

01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:54.060
And I would say, well, you should have tried writing it.

01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.020
But it was, because it has chunks of it,

01:56:01.420 --> 01:56:02.780
which I'm very proud of in particular,

01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:07.700
about the death of religion, the death of God,

01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:11.740
the loss of meaning and the void.

01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:16.740
And that's difficult stuff to write about and to grapple with.

01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:18.580
And there is a sort of...

01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:21.740
I haven't reread that book since it came out,

01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:25.340
but I think there are passages in it

01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.260
which reveal what I was thinking very clearly

01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:33.020
in the poetry of it as it were, as well as the detail.

01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:39.860
But yeah, I can't say, I'm used to saying what I think

01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:46.180
and what I see.

01:56:46.180 --> 01:56:49.380
And if there's any pushback I've got from that,

01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:51.340
I'm completely consoled that I'm saying

01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:53.020
what I see with my own eyes.

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.100
That's your source of strength,

01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:59.540
is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it.

01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:03.180
Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie

01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:05.180
if I've seen something with my own eyes.

01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:09.340
Do you ever, so speaking of Sam Harris,

01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.340
and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people,

01:57:13.340 --> 01:57:16.100
I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life

01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:18.980
on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:22.140
as their example of a very smart person.

01:57:23.300 --> 01:57:26.460
So given that compliment,

01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:33.460
do you ever worry that your sort of ego grows to a level

01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.060
where you're not, what you think is the truth

01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:38.100
is no longer the truth?

01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.260
Is this kind of...

01:57:42.700 --> 01:57:44.420
It blinds you.

01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:46.620
And also on top of that,

01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:50.660
the fact that you stand against the crowd often,

01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:52.580
that there's part of it that appeals to you,

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:56.420
that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.

01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:58.580
I get a certain thrill from the friction.

01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:02.740
Yeah, that sometimes both your ego

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:07.500
and the thrill of friction will get you to deviate

01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:10.540
from the truth and instead just look for the friction.

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:12.420
Could do, could do for sure.

01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:16.140
I try to keep alive to that.

01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:18.540
I mean, earlier in my career,

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:20.420
I realized that for instance,

01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:24.220
I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily,

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:26.460
any more than strictly necessary

01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.020
because there was a very large number

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:30.260
of already necessary enemies.

01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:31.900
And I remember once, I won't go into the details,

01:58:31.900 --> 01:58:35.540
but I already had one sort of thing I'd done that week

01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.580
and then another thing came out.

01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:39.420
I just thought, I can't, I can't do that.

01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:42.340
And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person

01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:45.300
who's forever creating storms.

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:47.940
And I tried to make sure I wasn't.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:51.060
And I think I've pretty much stuck to that.

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.500
But to answer your question,

01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:58.620
well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be

01:58:58.620 --> 01:59:01.460
that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described.

01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.300
Two reasons.

01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.460
I mean, one is that I don't think of myself

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:07.180
as a wildly intelligent person,

01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:11.340
partly because I'm very, very aware

01:59:11.340 --> 01:59:13.940
of the things I know nothing about.

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:17.340
I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge

01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:22.340
of the details of finance or economic theory.

01:59:26.300 --> 01:59:29.300
I mean, the real details, I don't mean the big picture

01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:30.820
of the kind that we were just discussing earlier,

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:35.820
but I have, if you put the periodic table in front of me,

01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:41.540
I would struggle to do more than a handful.

01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:49.940
I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:54.260
And where I have gaps or chasms,

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.660
I tend to find that I have a disproportionate admiration

01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:58.900
for the people who know that stuff.

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:01.780
Like I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money,

02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:03.620
really understand it, you know, because they say,

02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.100
how the hell do you do that?

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:09.100
And the same thing with biologists, medics,

02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.100
stuff I just know very little about.

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.580
And that's a source of humility for you,

02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.420
just knowing that.

02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:16.500
Yes, I mean, I think, well, I can't get on that stuff,

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:19.740
but Jesus, if you've got me on the general knowledge,

02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:21.260
I say that thing, some years ago,

02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:23.900
there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge.

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:27.020
I don't know if it was, and my,

02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:28.420
I was asked some years ago,

02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:30.860
I don't know if it was, I don't know if it was in the UK,

02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:34.700
and my, I was asked some years ago onto,

02:00:34.700 --> 02:00:36.220
there's a sort of psych celebrity,

02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.140
one of former students of the universities or colleges

02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:42.460
asked to go back for the Christmas special.

02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:45.820
And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college

02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:49.180
to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one.

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:50.580
And the only reason I actually wanted to do it

02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:52.060
was because I discovered that Louis Theroux

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.620
had been to my college before my time,

02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:55.820
and he was on, he'd agreed to be on the team.

02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.740
And I thought, well, I'd love to meet Louis Theroux,

02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.020
that'd be great fun.

02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:01.940
And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't wanna do it.

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.260
And they said, come on, you'd be great.

02:01:03.260 --> 02:01:04.100
I said, I wouldn't.

02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:07.420
I'd show myself up, I'd be a total asshole and ignoramus.

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.820
And as it was, I sat down, my flat,

02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:13.940
and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.

02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:18.060
And I realized I'd have just sat and mute

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:19.300
for the whole half hour.

02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:21.420
I just couldn't,

02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:23.260
I think the first question was about physics,

02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:25.540
and the second one was about,

02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:27.860
as it was, I watched the one,

02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:30.540
and I could answer the first two or three questions

02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:32.260
of the one that actually went out

02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:34.300
because they made it a bit simpler.

02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:37.860
But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the,

02:01:37.860 --> 02:01:40.020
and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on

02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:42.100
because I mean, I just couldn't answer the questions.

02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:44.300
These unbelievably smart students seem to be able

02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:46.100
to answer a whole range of things.

02:01:46.100 --> 02:01:49.820
So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations,

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.380
and-

02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.580
You contemplate your limitations.

02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:56.700
Yeah, and they're forever before me, you know.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.860
They're not hard to find in every day.

02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:01.660
And then on top of that, I suppose it's,

02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:06.620
in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's

02:02:08.460 --> 02:02:12.140
alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem,

02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:14.980
if there's a line-

02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:16.940
You just enjoy a good poem, can you?

02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:21.220
Well, no, it's not, I can enjoy a great poem,

02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.180
but I mean, a good poem.

02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:25.380
This is slightly off.

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:29.500
Wait, this goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:34.500
Take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt, so.

02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.500
Maybe I've heard it read

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.700
at too many memorial services and things.

02:02:37.700 --> 02:02:41.860
But that line is a good piece of rice.

02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:44.220
If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster

02:02:44.220 --> 02:02:48.420
and meet these, greet these two imposters just the same.

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.740
That's a good line.

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:51.580
It's a good line, as Kipling often does.

02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:53.300
He did an amazing turn of the line.

02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:56.140
But I do think that it's a very sensible thing

02:02:56.140 --> 02:03:00.700
to try to greet triumph and disaster

02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:03.900
and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same.

02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:07.580
And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never,

02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:11.380
partly it's because I have a sort of belief

02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.300
in the old gods, and at the moment that I thought

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:16.460
that I was at the moment of triumph,

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.180
the fates would hitch up their skirts

02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:20.340
and run at me at a million miles an hour.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:24.580
But it's also because I genuinely,

02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.300
anyone who knows me knows I never have a moment

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:32.300
when I say that's just great.

02:03:32.460 --> 02:03:37.340
I feel totally fulfilled and victorious.

02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:39.140
I mean, it happened to me recently

02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:40.940
when the war on the West went straight in

02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:43.340
and number one in the bestseller list.

02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:46.140
How long did that last in terms of your self-satisfaction?

02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:47.860
Didn't happen.

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.100
Not even for a brief moment?

02:03:49.100 --> 02:03:49.940
No.

02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:53.820
When I first saw that it was selling,

02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:55.220
I had that moment of elation.

02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:58.420
I thought, good, I've done it, it's out.

02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:02.940
And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely.

02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:04.940
But it doesn't last, partly because I tell myself

02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:05.860
it mustn't last.

02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:11.860
Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.

02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.020
Is that skirts?

02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:17.700
I don't, you brits with your poetry,

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:19.060
even when it's nauseating.

02:04:20.500 --> 02:04:24.580
As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:27.900
of the political leadership and the human mind

02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:30.820
and the human being of Donald Trump?

02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:34.580
I sort of avoided this for years.

02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:35.980
Just talking about Trump.

02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:37.700
Tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.700
Same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.

02:04:39.700 --> 02:04:41.820
Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent,

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:45.740
do you think that Trump's story is over

02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:47.700
or are we just done with volume one?

02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:48.540
I have no idea.

02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.300
There are people I know who know him, say that he's running.

02:04:54.500 --> 02:04:58.180
And I think that in general, Republicans have to,

02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:01.020
do have a choice in front of them.

02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:06.100
And one friend put it to me recently said,

02:05:06.100 --> 02:05:08.460
you've got to go in with your toughest fighter.

02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.700
And I understand that instinct.

02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:18.620
And I also think it's a very dangerous instinct

02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:20.460
because what if your toughest fighter

02:05:20.460 --> 02:05:22.180
is also your biggest liability?

02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:25.540
What's the best way to get out of the Democrat vote

02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:28.100
in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?

02:05:28.100 --> 02:05:30.260
And the people that are doing the war in the West

02:05:30.260 --> 02:05:32.820
are pretty tough fighters.

02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:33.900
They are.

02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:37.140
And I'm cautious about this because I know

02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:38.860
every way I tread is dangerous,

02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:41.180
but let me just be frank.

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.580
Tread gracefully.

02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:44.380
I'll tread as gracefully as I can.

02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:47.260
I'll tread as gracefully as I can in my Wellington boots.

02:05:47.260 --> 02:05:48.100
I am a galoshes.

02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:50.500
Here's the thing.

02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:54.620
I think everybody knows what Trump is.

02:05:54.620 --> 02:05:56.860
I think we all knew for years.

02:05:56.860 --> 02:05:59.260
And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend

02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:02.740
that he was something he wasn't.

02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:07.660
I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend that,

02:06:07.660 --> 02:06:09.780
for instance, he was some devout Christian

02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:13.820
or a man of faith or a man of great integrity

02:06:13.820 --> 02:06:16.380
or all of these sorts of things.

02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:18.500
Because in the public eye for years,

02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:21.180
it had been obvious that wasn't the case.

02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:24.700
But he has something extraordinary.

02:06:26.180 --> 02:06:28.780
One thing is a method of communication

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:33.060
that you've just got to say was unbelievable.

02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:35.220
In one fundamental way that you can't look away

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.060
for some reason.

02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:36.900
Can't look away.

02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:42.020
I mean, I mean, watching him clear everyone out of the way

02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:45.140
in 2016 was thrilling.

02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.980
Cause those people needed clearing away.

02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:49.580
You know, Sam is just horrified.

02:06:49.580 --> 02:06:51.940
What America is going to give us another Bush?

02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:54.900
What's so great about this family?

02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:58.500
America is going to give us another Clinton.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:01.380
We're going to get to choose any Clinton on the Bush.

02:07:01.380 --> 02:07:03.460
Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day

02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:05.100
that Clinton is in the Bush is in to marry.

02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:07.380
And then we can really have a monarchy again.

02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:12.180
So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.

02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:17.020
I was very pleased to see him sort of raise

02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:18.780
some of the issues that needed raising.

02:07:18.780 --> 02:07:21.140
I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air

02:07:21.140 --> 02:07:23.140
and I wished it wasn't him doing it.

02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.660
And then there was the question of him governing

02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:27.700
and it was just perfectly clear.

02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:29.180
He didn't know how to govern.

02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:32.860
What he did have, however, what he does have

02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:35.180
is an incredible ability to fight.

02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.140
And some of the forces he was arraigned against

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:38.340
were arraigned against him.

02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:41.620
My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:46.620
I mean, if they'd have probably done some similar BS

02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:51.180
against Ted Cruz, if he, you know, or Marco Rubio,

02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:54.460
you know, they'd have said, as some people admitted,

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:56.340
they'd have accused all these people of racism

02:07:56.340 --> 02:07:57.820
and misogyny and everything else as well.

02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:58.860
Just like they did Mitt Romney,

02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:01.260
just like they did John McCain.

02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:03.540
But Trump was the one ugly enough

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:05.340
and bruisey enough to fight.

02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:11.540
And also a willingness or a lack of willingness

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:17.540
to play sort of the civil game of politics

02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:22.860
sort of, you know, at a party when like politeness

02:08:22.860 --> 02:08:23.780
gets you in trouble.

02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:24.620
Yeah, I mean.

02:08:24.620 --> 02:08:25.460
You show up and everybody's polite

02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:28.340
and you just out of momentum wanna be being polite

02:08:28.340 --> 02:08:30.060
and all of a sudden you're on an island

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:33.100
with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you

02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:34.460
into a huge amount of trouble.

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:37.100
But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities,

02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:41.060
but I just, you know, look, he screwed up

02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:43.380
during his time in office because he didn't achieve

02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:44.940
as much as he should have done.

02:08:44.940 --> 02:08:46.300
Now you could say that about every president,

02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:47.980
but I refuse to acknowledge that two years

02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:50.100
when he had both houses in the first, the beginning,

02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:52.300
he just didn't know what levers to pull.

02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.500
You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office

02:08:54.500 --> 02:08:58.180
behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news.

02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:00.260
I'm sorry, that's not a president.

02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:03.900
And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions

02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:06.980
because people knew, I mean, people who were very loyal

02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:10.100
to him, he would just, you know, he'd get them

02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.380
to do something loyal and then destroy them.

02:09:12.380 --> 02:09:15.700
And I think, and then we get onto the thing about,

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:18.020
and here we get onto the, you know, what of course

02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:19.780
is very, very fractious terrain.

02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:22.460
But, you know, I covered the 2020 election

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:24.420
and I was traveling all around the States

02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:27.940
and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of stuff.

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:31.700
And I was in DC on election night

02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.940
and it got very ugly at one point

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:38.620
in so-called Black Lives Matter Plaza.

02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:40.020
When it looked like Trump might win,

02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:41.940
when Florida came in and got really,

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:44.340
I could feel the air were very, very heated

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:47.220
and some antifascist people started getting

02:09:47.220 --> 02:09:48.900
into black lock and this sort of stuff.

02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:51.500
And I thought, this town's gonna burn, you know,

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:53.340
if Trump wins.

02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:55.500
And in the aftermath of the vote,

02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:58.380
I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit

02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:00.660
and then I saw what it was gonna drag on.

02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:02.660
And I saw some of his people and others

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.220
and people told me they had great evidence

02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:06.300
of vote rigging and all this sort of thing.

02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:08.580
And I'm afraid I'm one of those people

02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:11.420
who doesn't believe that the evidence

02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:13.700
that they've presented is good enough to justify the claim

02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:14.900
that he won the election.

02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:19.660
And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:20.740
and have you seen anything?

02:10:20.740 --> 02:10:23.220
Look, the evidence isn't there.

02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:26.660
The election was won by Donald Trump.

02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:30.300
And I think that what he did on January the 6th

02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:33.980
was unbelievably dangerous.

02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.580
And, you know, here it is possible for us

02:10:36.580 --> 02:10:38.940
to hold two ideas in our head at the same time.

02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:40.900
January the 6th was not nothing,

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:44.540
nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup.

02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:50.860
And there's a vanishing number of people in the US

02:10:50.860 --> 02:10:52.580
or as Eric Weinstein said,

02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:57.580
it's like this is the roof that you have to walk along.

02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:01.540
And like the sides are very steep

02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:03.660
if you fall off either side.

02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:07.460
Is there some sense given the forces

02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:09.660
that are waging war in the West,

02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:14.020
he said this feeling perhaps because of Antifa

02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:16.940
or something else that this town is gonna burn

02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:19.060
and maybe a continued feeling that this town

02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:22.940
is going to burn with the January 6th events.

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:27.940
Are you worried about the future of the United States

02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:33.100
in the coming years because of the feeling of escalation?

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:36.980
Is that just a war of Twitter?

02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:41.260
Or is there a real brewing of something?

02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.500
Oh, it's real.

02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:45.580
And how, well, let me then respond to that.

02:11:45.580 --> 02:11:47.620
How, what is the hopeful?

02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:52.620
If you 10 years from now look back at the United States

02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:58.820
and say we turned it around, what would be the reason?

02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:01.140
What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?

02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.420
Tell you, since I wrote this book,

02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:06.020
there are two things in particular

02:12:06.020 --> 02:12:08.940
that I've been really pleased

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:12.300
that a specific type of specialist has approached me on

02:12:12.300 --> 02:12:14.460
to say that things I've written about

02:12:14.460 --> 02:12:17.220
actually have more application than I realized.

02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.820
One is the gratitude issue.

02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:21.220
A number of people have approached me

02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:25.980
who have gone through AA or Alcoholics Anonymous.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.740
They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?

02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:30.020
And that's a bit personal question.

02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:36.580
But the reason they ask it is because they say,

02:12:36.580 --> 02:12:38.660
well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation

02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:39.980
or Alcohol Anonymous,

02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.020
Norm McDonald said, it doesn't sound very anonymous.

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:46.380
You stand up in a room, you say your name

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:48.860
and you type on the worst things you've ever done.

02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.300
Sounds the opposite of anonymous.

02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:52.700
Anyhow, but they say, look,

02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:54.540
because if you go to these things,

02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:57.660
apparently you're asked to as part of your recovery,

02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.460
say what you're grateful for,

02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:02.060
like list what you're grateful for.

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:05.180
I didn't know that by the way, until the book was out.

02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:07.220
And so that turned out to have more application

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:08.220
than I knew.

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:09.660
The other thing though is that I say

02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:12.020
that it's absolutely crucial in America

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:14.300
that we try to find things that we agree on.

02:13:14.340 --> 02:13:16.460
And a couple of times since the book came out,

02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:19.300
I've been approached by people who are marriage counselors.

02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:21.300
But we've also said,

02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:22.700
if you've ever been through marriage counseling,

02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:24.940
again, that's a very personal question.

02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:27.700
Stop asking me personal questions.

02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:30.580
No, but they said, and I said, well, why?

02:13:30.580 --> 02:13:35.300
Well, because this is one of the things that we do

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:39.940
in couples therapy is try to find things you agree on.

02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:44.820
And I think this is very important in America.

02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:47.260
And it's made much harder by the fact,

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:48.140
and I've said this many times,

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:49.860
but forgive me if I'm repeating myself,

02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:52.700
but it's made much harder by the fact

02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:56.900
that having different opinions is very last century.

02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:58.500
Now we all have different facts,

02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.900
or at least the two sides have different facts.

02:14:02.180 --> 02:14:05.900
One half of the country roughly, or let's say 40%, 30%,

02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:07.300
whatever you want to put it,

02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:10.220
with a tired minority in the middle.

02:14:11.340 --> 02:14:13.460
One segment of the country believes

02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:16.020
that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election

02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.140
and that the Russians interfered

02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:19.540
and got Donald Trump into power.

02:14:19.540 --> 02:14:20.980
Another half of the country believes

02:14:20.980 --> 02:14:23.100
that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.

02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:24.620
If you can't agree on who wins elections,

02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:27.660
it's very hard to see what you agree on as a country.

02:14:27.660 --> 02:14:29.380
That's one of the reasons I mind the war

02:14:29.380 --> 02:14:31.420
on American history and Western history

02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:33.660
is one of the things you have to agree on

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:36.100
is at least some attitude towards your past.

02:14:36.100 --> 02:14:37.780
You don't have to go and everything.

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:40.500
But the public square has to have public heroes

02:14:40.500 --> 02:14:44.220
who are agreed to be heroes to some extent, warts and all.

02:14:45.420 --> 02:14:48.180
If you don't have that, if actually you think,

02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.620
for instance, half the country thinks founding fathers

02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:53.020
were pretty good, the other half thinks

02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:55.820
they were absolutely rotten racists and so on.

02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:57.500
If half the country basically thinks

02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:58.940
it would have been better if Columbus

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:01.740
had taken a different turn, never found America,

02:15:01.740 --> 02:15:05.220
gone back home and said nothing out there,

02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.420
that would have been better.

02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:08.700
And the other half's pretty glad in the end

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:10.420
that we've got America.

02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:16.580
You've got to agree on something.

02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:19.180
And I just see in America, so I do think

02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:20.540
we've got to try to find things to agree on,

02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:23.060
like a reasonable attitude towards the past.

02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:24.740
That's why that matters.

02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:27.500
And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say

02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:29.460
that everything in the American past was good.

02:15:29.460 --> 02:15:30.900
God knows that wouldn't stand up

02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:33.300
to a second of scrutiny or self-scrutiny.

02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:35.140
But nor was it all bad.

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:38.780
This wasn't a country formed in sin

02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:40.740
and in an eradicable sin.

02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.060
It wasn't founded in 1619 in order to make the country

02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:49.140
wicked and incapable of escaping that wickedness.

02:15:49.140 --> 02:15:51.500
These are things that will matter enormously

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.780
in the years ahead.

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.820
Because if you can't agree on anything,

02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.660
including who your heroes are,

02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:02.060
like the whole thing is just one massive division,

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:04.140
and we'll see what I think we're already seeing,

02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:06.340
which is people basically going to states

02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:08.900
where it's more like the life they want to live.

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:11.500
And some people say to me, well, that's okay.

02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:14.900
And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.

02:16:16.380 --> 02:16:18.660
That's possible, but it's also,

02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:22.740
it eradicates part of what has been American public life,

02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:24.500
which is the ability to look at each other

02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:26.900
and discuss face to face.

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:30.100
And I see things like this bomb placed under America

02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.020
the other week with the Supreme Court League,

02:16:32.020 --> 02:16:35.700
the draft league as being just a further example of that.

02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:39.220
I'm very, very worried about it in America.

02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:43.220
And because if America screws up everything,

02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:45.700
everything else in the world goes.

02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:48.020
Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still

02:16:48.020 --> 02:16:53.020
the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded

02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:58.900
and has been able to live out in better and better forms,

02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:01.340
sort of live out the actual ideals

02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:03.580
of the founding principles versus like.

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.420
And with the desire to improve.

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:06.260
Yeah, constantly.

02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:08.340
An imperfect union.

02:17:08.340 --> 02:17:12.220
Yeah, well, as I generally have hope that people want

02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:14.820
to sort of, in terms of gratitude,

02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:19.260
people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.

02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.500
It's a better life psychologically.

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.900
The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.

02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:30.580
So I just feel that people will long for that

02:17:30.580 --> 02:17:31.740
and will find that.

02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:33.620
And that's the American way.

02:17:33.620 --> 02:17:36.700
Some of the division that we reveal now has to do

02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:38.940
with new technologies like social media.

02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:43.300
That kind of is a small kind of deviation

02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:45.380
from the path we're on because it's a new,

02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:47.940
we've got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons.

02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:49.820
Yeah, which is relatively new.

02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:53.780
But we need to find reasonable attitudes

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:54.620
towards these things.

02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:56.580
That's why I say like it matters how you

02:17:56.580 --> 02:17:59.460
and my feedback on social media

02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:02.260
because we're all going through it to some extent.

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:03.100
We're learning.

02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:03.940
And we're learning.

02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:08.540
And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad.

02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:13.020
I say this as my minimalist call to friends in this era

02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:16.860
was the main job is not to go insane.

02:18:16.860 --> 02:18:17.700
Yeah.

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:20.540
Yeah.

02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:22.820
And yeah, like walk towards sanity.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:26.660
Because, you know, I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson

02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:27.500
quote in there.

02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:30.420
Insanity on the weekends can be at least fun.

02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:31.300
Okay.

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.140
Do you have advice for young people

02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:37.380
that just put down their TikTok

02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:40.860
and are listening to this podcast in high school

02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:43.100
and college about how to have a career

02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:45.300
or how to have a life they can be proud of?

02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:50.780
So April question, but of course, I mean,

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.340
I can give specific advice for people

02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:53.700
who want to be writers and so on,

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:54.940
but that's a bit niche, maybe.

02:18:56.060 --> 02:18:57.740
Well, writers will be very interesting.

02:18:57.740 --> 02:18:58.740
Sorry to interrupt.

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:00.820
Also how to put your ideas down on paper

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:03.100
and think that the ideas develop them

02:19:03.100 --> 02:19:06.940
and have the guts to go to a large audience,

02:19:06.940 --> 02:19:09.620
especially when the ideas are sort of controversial

02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:10.940
or dangerous or difficult.

02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:13.340
Well, the main thing to do is to read.

02:19:13.340 --> 02:19:16.460
When I was a schoolboy, I'd ever have a book in my pocket,

02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:20.380
the side pocket of my jacket on the side pocket

02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.540
and would read.

02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:26.540
And that wasn't just because I was swattish in some way,

02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:28.980
but because I discovered,

02:19:30.060 --> 02:19:31.820
probably at some point in my early teens,

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:34.660
I discovered something, I read about this once.

02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:37.860
I discovered that books were dangerous,

02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:41.500
which was a thrilling discovery.

02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:42.340
Yeah.

02:19:44.500 --> 02:19:46.860
I discovered that they could contain anything.

02:19:47.900 --> 02:19:50.380
And also people didn't know what you were reading.

02:19:50.380 --> 02:19:52.660
I remember I got far too young an age.

02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:55.220
I read the Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley

02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:01.820
and I didn't make head or tail of it probably,

02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:03.180
but I knew that it was about something

02:20:03.180 --> 02:20:05.420
really interesting and dangerous.

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:10.660
And I thought constantly when I read poetry

02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:14.660
or read history, I was just constantly thrilled

02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:18.820
and wanted to know more.

02:20:18.860 --> 02:20:22.620
And if you wanna become a writer,

02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:24.220
you have to be a reader.

02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:28.020
You have to read the best stuff.

02:20:29.660 --> 02:20:33.580
And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is

02:20:33.580 --> 02:20:37.500
and you'll find the people that really impress you.

02:20:37.500 --> 02:20:39.660
But I know that I just came across certain writers

02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:42.260
who just knocked me off my feet.

02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:47.900
And when you find those people, read everything

02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:53.580
and cling on to them and find other people like that,

02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:56.980
find other writers like that or people who are connected

02:20:56.980 --> 02:21:01.620
by history or scholarship or circles or whatever.

02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:03.940
For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?

02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:06.380
Is there a particular book that you just remember

02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:07.940
where it just gave you pause?

02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:09.340
Well, I remember that the first book

02:21:09.420 --> 02:21:13.140
that absolutely threw me was The Lord of the Flies

02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.340
by William Golding, which used to be a signed text

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:18.420
and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular.

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:22.700
But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book

02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:26.300
I read in that I had been used to the world

02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:29.700
of children's literature, of everything ends up fine

02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:32.540
in the end, the lost all get found.

02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.540
And this was the first book I'd read

02:21:35.540 --> 02:21:37.700
where that's not the case,

02:21:37.740 --> 02:21:39.580
where the world turns out differently.

02:21:39.580 --> 02:21:42.500
And I remember for days afterwards,

02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:44.700
I was just in a state of shock.

02:21:46.020 --> 02:21:51.020
I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:54.100
and partly because I sort of intuited it must be true.

02:21:55.380 --> 02:21:57.180
And of course that is not to say that The Lord of the Flies

02:21:57.180 --> 02:22:00.300
has lots of scholarship on what children do

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.660
in the situation of being on the island

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:03.620
or when they do congregate and anyhow.

02:22:04.540 --> 02:22:07.020
But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world

02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:11.700
and it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it.

02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:15.620
It was dangerous.

02:22:15.620 --> 02:22:16.460
And it was dangerous.

02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:19.580
And then of course, when I became interested in sex,

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:21.380
let alone when I realized I was gay,

02:22:21.380 --> 02:22:23.340
I realized books were a very, very good way

02:22:23.340 --> 02:22:25.700
to learn about what I was.

02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:28.540
And that was even more dangerous in a way.

02:22:28.540 --> 02:22:32.060
And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know.

02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:33.660
And-

02:22:33.660 --> 02:22:36.460
You discovered sex, that was an invention in books.

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:37.300
What do you mean?

02:22:37.300 --> 02:22:39.500
No, what I mean is, no, no, no, no, no.

02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.700
What I mean is that one of the things that gay people have

02:22:41.700 --> 02:22:43.620
when they're growing up is that

02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:45.460
you have this terribly big secret

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:47.180
and you don't think the world will ever know.

02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:49.540
You hope the world will never know.

02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:54.060
And it's been called by one psychologist

02:22:54.060 --> 02:22:56.260
the little boy with a big secret.

02:22:56.260 --> 02:22:59.940
And so if you discover that other people

02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:04.540
have the same secret, there's a sort of, thank God for that.

02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:08.500
But I mean, that's just a version of what everybody gets

02:23:08.500 --> 02:23:11.100
in reading in a way, which is the thrill of discovery

02:23:11.100 --> 02:23:13.900
that somebody else thought something

02:23:13.900 --> 02:23:15.420
you thought only you'd thought.

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:18.860
I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature

02:23:18.860 --> 02:23:21.500
is when a voice comes from across the centuries

02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:24.780
and seems to leave a handprint, you know.

02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.820
It makes you feel a little bit less alone

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:29.940
because somebody else feels, sees the world the same way,

02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:31.100
is the same way.

02:23:31.100 --> 02:23:34.460
That's what C.S. Lewis has said to have said.

02:23:35.380 --> 02:23:36.780
We read to know we're not alone.

02:23:37.780 --> 02:23:39.340
But we don't only read to know we're not alone.

02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:41.420
We read to become other people.

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:45.260
I mean, I think I saw in books a version of the life

02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:48.220
I wanted to live, and then I decided to live it.

02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:50.220
And I'm fortunate enough to have done so.

02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:54.620
I wanted to live in the world of ideas

02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:56.900
and books and debate.

02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:01.660
I wanted to live in the debates of my time, you know.

02:24:01.900 --> 02:24:04.500
And I remember when, like a lot of people,

02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:06.460
I read Auden when I was young.

02:24:06.460 --> 02:24:09.780
And, you know, certain lines obviously stuck with me,

02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:13.580
but that poem of his, which everybody knows

02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:17.820
and which he hated, September the 1st, 1939,

02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:21.260
I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me.

02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:24.100
Once I was sitting on a dive,

02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:26.620
and for a second, we'd degraded and alone

02:24:28.620 --> 02:24:31.380
at the end of a low, dishonest decade.

02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:33.060
And of course, there's a problem with that line,

02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:34.260
which is you kind of want to be living

02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.580
at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well.

02:24:36.580 --> 02:24:38.660
It sounds sort of cool in a way.

02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:41.300
You know, you're the only person who sees it.

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.540
But, so yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion.

02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:45.380
But the point is, if you want to be a writer,

02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:46.620
you've got to be a reader.

02:24:47.580 --> 02:24:50.260
And apart from anything else, you discover the lilt

02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:53.420
of language and the things you can do.

02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:56.260
And I've read people who, and I still do,

02:24:56.260 --> 02:25:00.140
who I think, my God, I didn't, how did you do that?

02:25:00.140 --> 02:25:03.100
In fact, books for me now, and articles and other things,

02:25:03.100 --> 02:25:04.220
fall into two categories.

02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.860
One is, I know how you did that.

02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:10.300
And the other is, I don't know how you did that.

02:25:10.300 --> 02:25:13.340
And the best feeling as a writer

02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:15.540
is when you do the second one.

02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:19.540
And it happens occasionally in my writing life.

02:25:19.540 --> 02:25:21.540
Will you almost like return to something you've written,

02:25:21.540 --> 02:25:22.580
or like right after you write?

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.980
No, the moment you write it.

02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.580
You wonder, how did I do that?

02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:29.420
Yes, that's the most, I've never said that before.

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.580
That's the happiest thing in writing.

02:25:32.500 --> 02:25:33.900
Very occasionally it sounds,

02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:37.580
but I mean, I've occasionally finished something.

02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:38.940
Funny enough, it happened some years ago

02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:41.540
in a long piece I wrote about the artist Basquiat.

02:25:44.580 --> 02:25:47.020
I finished the piece and I gasped.

02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:50.980
I didn't know, because that's also a thing with writing,

02:25:50.980 --> 02:25:55.420
is you, it's not, sometimes people say you need to write

02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:56.340
in order to know what you think.

02:25:56.340 --> 02:25:58.220
That's not quite true.

02:25:58.220 --> 02:26:00.540
Sometimes you, that's a very bad piece of advice

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:03.460
for some writers who don't know what they think

02:26:03.460 --> 02:26:04.780
and it's not gonna become clearer

02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:06.620
if they just start typing.

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:11.620
But sometimes it is true that you,

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:15.700
there's a thought that's just waiting there

02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:17.700
and a clarity that comes across

02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:20.700
and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.

02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:24.500
And by the time you've typed it, you just go, yes.

02:26:25.580 --> 02:26:27.260
That's the greatest feeling as a writer.

02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:29.820
Almost like it came from somewhere else.

02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:34.220
That's what Bakunin says about,

02:26:34.220 --> 02:26:36.580
what's the moment is Tom Stoppard's favorite quote

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:38.820
about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment

02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:42.100
where the writer's pen, when he pauses,

02:26:42.100 --> 02:26:43.740
where does he go in that moment?

02:26:45.260 --> 02:26:47.820
Yeah, that's so interesting.

02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:52.420
Cause I think the answer to that question

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:54.500
will help us explain consciousness

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:58.220
and all those other weird things about the human mind.

02:26:58.220 --> 02:26:59.700
So that was advice for writers.

02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:02.940
I didn't really give any advice for people in general.

02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:05.260
Is that, oh, you wanna give health advice?

02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:06.100
No.

02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:07.580
To your channel, Churchill and?

02:27:07.580 --> 02:27:09.180
No, I don't wanna give health advice.

02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:10.300
Clearly.

02:27:10.300 --> 02:27:12.140
Because you implied that Churchill

02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:15.260
was one of your early guides in that aspect.

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:17.820
So when you discovered your sexuality,

02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.300
let me ask about love.

02:27:20.140 --> 02:27:25.140
Two person, far too personal of a question to ask a Brit,

02:27:25.260 --> 02:27:28.100
but what was that like?

02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:30.140
And broadly speaking,

02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:33.060
what's the role of love in the human condition?

02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:37.020
Sex and love.

02:27:37.020 --> 02:27:39.180
And for you personally,

02:27:39.180 --> 02:27:42.140
discovering that you were and maybe telling the world

02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:43.700
that you were gay.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:47.980
I'm very perilously personal.

02:27:48.020 --> 02:27:49.140
I do actually have a sort of rule

02:27:49.140 --> 02:27:51.420
that I don't talk about in my personal life.

02:27:51.420 --> 02:27:52.740
Rules are meant to be broken.

02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:54.540
Okay, well I'll break it a little bit.

02:27:57.180 --> 02:27:59.500
One of the ways in which growing up and realizing you're gay

02:27:59.500 --> 02:28:02.340
differs from growing up and being straight

02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:05.260
is that it's almost inevitable

02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:08.100
that your first passions will be unrequited.

02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:12.860
Oh wow, I never thought about that.

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:13.700
Yeah.

02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:16.060
Now that's not to say, I mean,

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:18.580
there's plenty of unrequited love among young men

02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:20.180
for young women, young women for young men.

02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:21.740
Plenty of, you know that.

02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:23.460
But it's almost inevitable if you're gay

02:28:23.460 --> 02:28:28.460
that your first passions will be totally unrequited.

02:28:30.020 --> 02:28:33.060
Because the odds are that the person in question

02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:33.900
will not be gay.

02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:37.460
So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.

02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:40.460
It's heartbreak and disappointment.

02:28:40.460 --> 02:28:42.100
Heartbreak can be beautiful too.

02:28:42.100 --> 02:28:43.220
Of course. It's formative.

02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:45.300
Well, again, it comes back to the thing

02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.580
of if you're a writer or something,

02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:48.860
because you can always do something with it.

02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:51.460
That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.

02:28:53.900 --> 02:28:56.060
I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here.

02:28:56.060 --> 02:29:01.060
No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:05.260
because you always think, well, I could use that.

02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:07.020
It's dangerous.

02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:08.860
It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware of it.

02:29:08.860 --> 02:29:10.260
It's almost like a drug, right?

02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:11.700
No, it's not like a drug.

02:29:11.700 --> 02:29:15.100
It's the fear that all things,

02:29:15.100 --> 02:29:18.300
even the greatest suffering, it could be material.

02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:22.340
What's the danger in that exactly?

02:29:22.340 --> 02:29:25.540
That seeing the material in the human experience,

02:29:25.540 --> 02:29:26.940
you don't experience it fully?

02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:29.740
You don't experience it fully and you might be using it.

02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:33.300
I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend

02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:36.460
who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s.

02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:38.100
And he said, he knew at the moment,

02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:39.260
he was told that his friend's death,

02:29:39.300 --> 02:29:42.180
tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem.

02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.460
And he did and the poem was wonderful,

02:29:43.460 --> 02:29:45.620
but there's always that slight guilt for writers

02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.260
of am I going to use that?

02:29:48.260 --> 02:29:49.980
Anyhow, that's the divergence.

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:51.500
Life is full of guilty pleasures

02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:52.620
and I think that's one of them.

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:54.620
Because if you feel that guilt,

02:29:54.620 --> 02:29:57.940
really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment

02:29:57.940 --> 02:30:01.380
and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people

02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:02.740
by writing about that moment

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.700
because it's going to stimulate something

02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:06.420
that resonates with those people

02:30:06.420 --> 02:30:08.060
because they had similar kinds of memories

02:30:08.060 --> 02:30:10.740
about a loss and a passion towards somebody

02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:11.580
that they had to lose.

02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:15.460
So don't, yes, but there's a good sign perhaps.

02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:19.700
More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones

02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:23.780
or bad places and wanting to find bad stories

02:30:23.780 --> 02:30:24.860
because it's useful.

02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:26.980
And there is a definite guilt you get

02:30:26.980 --> 02:30:28.100
from that sort of thing.

02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:30.900
Like the worse the situation, the more useful.

02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:34.940
Anyhow, no, so that's still the only difference

02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:36.420
that happens to growing up being gay.

02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:39.780
And it means that most, certainly in my generation,

02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:44.780
most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later.

02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:49.220
And there's lots of explanations of that

02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:52.620
maybe being one of the reasons for perceived

02:30:52.620 --> 02:30:55.220
or otherwise promiscuity among gay men,

02:30:55.220 --> 02:30:57.420
which is, I think, more easily persuaded by the fact

02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:02.060
that gay men behave like men would if women were men.

02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:06.020
That's one explanation.

02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:08.540
But it's both a feature and a bug

02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:12.820
that you come to sexual flourishing later in life.

02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:14.500
That could be seen as a,

02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:16.780
in the trajectory of human life,

02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:19.020
that could be a positive or a negative.

02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:21.980
But what's broadly speaking is the role of love

02:31:21.980 --> 02:31:24.340
in the human condition, Douglas.

02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:28.860
Well, it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point.

02:31:30.100 --> 02:31:31.140
What is the point?

02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:32.420
What's the meaning of life?

02:31:32.420 --> 02:31:33.420
Let's go there.

02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:36.060
So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course.

02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:38.260
Where is the meaning is slightly easier.

02:31:40.660 --> 02:31:43.780
And I'd say that everyone can find that.

02:31:43.780 --> 02:31:47.100
You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.

02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:48.540
Now, there's a conservative answer to this,

02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:49.540
which is quite useful.

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:51.620
And it's certainly more useful than any others

02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:53.540
because the conservative answer is find meaning

02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:55.220
where people have found it before,

02:31:56.300 --> 02:31:58.180
which is a very, very good answer.

02:31:58.180 --> 02:31:59.220
Yeah.

02:31:59.540 --> 02:32:02.740
If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship

02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:07.740
or a particular canon of work, go there

02:32:08.660 --> 02:32:11.700
because it's been proven by time

02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.900
to be able to give you the goods.

02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:17.940
Much more sensible than saying,

02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:20.340
hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning.

02:32:20.340 --> 02:32:25.340
But love is probably the nearest thing we can have

02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:32.740
to the divine on earth.

02:32:32.740 --> 02:32:36.180
And of course, the problem of what exactly,

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:39.660
what type of love we mean is an issue.

02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:40.700
Well, that goes to the fact

02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:43.620
that you don't like definitions anyway.

02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:44.460
I do like definitions.

02:32:44.460 --> 02:32:46.500
I just think they need to be pinned down

02:32:46.500 --> 02:32:48.620
and they need to be used in a way

02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:49.540
that I don't like definitions.

02:32:49.540 --> 02:32:51.220
I just think they need to be pinned down,

02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:55.740
but let's not go there at the moment because it's-

02:32:57.660 --> 02:32:59.380
That's not pinned down love at the moment?

02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:01.660
Well, no, because as you know,

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:03.420
I mean, because of the different varieties of love

02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:05.180
and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture

02:33:05.180 --> 02:33:06.820
and that it means an awful lot of things

02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:09.300
and we don't delineate it well.

02:33:09.300 --> 02:33:14.300
But let's say human love with the greatest fulfillment

02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:19.620
in sexual fulfillment in sexual love with another person

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:26.340
is probably the greatest information you can have

02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:31.340
of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love.

02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:40.020
And it's the sense that all young lovers have,

02:33:40.420 --> 02:33:44.180
which is that they've just walked through the low door

02:33:45.020 --> 02:33:47.300
in the garden and found themselves in bliss.

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:48.620
And that this is,

02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:53.620
there's a beautiful, beautiful poem of,

02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:56.100
can I read it to you?

02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:56.940
Yes, please.

02:33:57.780 --> 02:33:58.620
I'll try to find it.

02:33:58.620 --> 02:34:01.940
There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkins,

02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:04.980
which slightly says what I'm,

02:34:06.660 --> 02:34:08.500
I'm trying not to duck your question

02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:10.860
by referring to other people, but-

02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:13.220
Maybe that's the best way to answer the question.

02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:14.060
Could be.

02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:16.700
Is to read a poem.

02:34:16.700 --> 02:34:21.700
So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows,

02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:26.820
which is remarkable because he came to sexual,

02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:33.820
he was straight, he had a rather unhappy sex life,

02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:38.260
but he came to sexual fruition in the forties

02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:41.300
and fifties and all the hell that that involved.

02:34:41.300 --> 02:34:46.300
And he took us, he took what I regard

02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:49.140
as being a really remarkable and important view

02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:51.260
on the sexual revolution of the sixties,

02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.900
which is that most people of his generation,

02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:54.620
older people resented the young.

02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.820
They resented the freedom they had

02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:00.660
and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible

02:35:00.660 --> 02:35:02.220
and it was always getting lightly done.

02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:03.740
And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly,

02:35:03.740 --> 02:35:06.300
he was a very conservative person, took a different view.

02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:07.620
And he says it in his poem.

02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:09.900
And the opening of the poem is, he says,

02:35:09.980 --> 02:35:13.700
when I see a couple of kids and guess he's fucking her

02:35:13.700 --> 02:35:16.980
and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm,

02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:19.180
I know this is paradise.

02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.540
Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives.

02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:25.180
Bonds and gestures pushed to one side

02:35:25.180 --> 02:35:28.020
like an outdated combine harvester

02:35:28.020 --> 02:35:31.780
and everyone young going down the long slide

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:34.500
to happiness endlessly.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.940
I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought

02:35:38.980 --> 02:35:41.300
that'll be the life, no God anymore

02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:44.180
or sweating in the dark about hell and that

02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:46.820
or having to hide what you think of the priest.

02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:49.980
He and his lot will all go down the long slide

02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:52.860
like free bloody birds.

02:35:52.860 --> 02:35:55.860
And immediately rather than words

02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:58.820
comes the thought of high windows,

02:35:58.820 --> 02:36:02.060
the sun comprehending glass and beyond it,

02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:05.660
the deep blue air that shows nothing

02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:09.700
and is nowhere and is endless.

02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:12.820
The divine, he found it.

02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:16.900
He found it in seeing a couple of young kids

02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:20.220
and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm.

02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:21.220
Do you see what I mean?

02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:22.900
It's first of all, it's very counterintuitive.

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:25.260
But secondly, this is the point that sex

02:36:25.260 --> 02:36:28.340
had been so tied up with misery.

02:36:29.420 --> 02:36:30.860
I mean, people don't remember this now

02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:33.020
when they talk about the past.

02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:34.500
I mean, there's one of my favorite books,

02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:36.660
Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday,

02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:39.140
including the descriptions of what it was like

02:36:39.140 --> 02:36:42.540
trying to have sex in pre First World War Vienna.

02:36:42.540 --> 02:36:46.060
All the men ended up going to female prostitutes.

02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:48.060
So many of them got syphilis

02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.740
and this was their first experience with sex.

02:36:49.740 --> 02:36:51.420
It was so goddamn awful

02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:53.420
and they were stuck with it all their lives.

02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:56.860
And so there's lots of stuff that's gone better

02:36:56.860 --> 02:36:59.500
in our last century and that's one of them.

02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:00.340
But you ask about love.

02:37:00.340 --> 02:37:02.580
Yes, I do think that love is basically

02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:08.020
the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine.

02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:12.140
And by the way, sex, liberating sex

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:15.460
doesn't buy you love.

02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:16.460
No.

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.100
I mean, it throws in an entirely,

02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:21.820
it threw in another set of problems.

02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:26.820
If there's any meaning on top of all of that

02:37:27.100 --> 02:37:31.260
is we like to find problems and solve that

02:37:31.260 --> 02:37:32.700
as a human species.

02:37:32.740 --> 02:37:35.460
And sometimes we even create problems.

02:37:37.980 --> 02:37:39.740
Douglas, thank you for highlighting

02:37:39.740 --> 02:37:41.940
all the problems of human civilization

02:37:41.940 --> 02:37:44.300
and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future.

02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:46.620
This is an incredible conversation.

02:37:46.620 --> 02:37:48.260
Thank you for talking today, it's a huge honor.

02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:49.100
Thank you.

02:37:49.100 --> 02:37:51.500
It was very kind of you to say that, thank you.

02:37:51.500 --> 02:37:52.900
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:54.140
with Douglas Murray.

02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:55.420

And now let me leave you with some words

02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:01.660
from Douglas Murray himself.

02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:05.460
Disagreement is not oppression.

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:08.020
Argument is not assault.

02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:12.140
Words, even provocative and repugnant ones,

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:14.060
are not violence.

02:38:14.060 --> 02:38:19.060
The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.

02:38:19.100 --> 02:38:20.060
Thank you for listening.

02:38:20.060 --> 02:38:21.580
I hope to see you next time.
