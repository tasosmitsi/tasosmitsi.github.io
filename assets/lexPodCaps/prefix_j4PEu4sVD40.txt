00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
People whose favorite songs are their happy songs,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.680
play it on their playlist about 175 times.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.880
The people who love sad music play them about 800 times.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.080
And they say that they feel connected to the sublime

00:14.080 --> 00:16.160
when they're listening to that music.

00:16.160 --> 00:19.440
The longing for what you lack is the very thing

00:19.440 --> 00:21.800
that gives you what you're longing for.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.160
So the longing is the cure.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.520
The following is a conversation with Susan Cain,

00:28.600 --> 00:30.520
author of Quiet,

00:30.520 --> 00:32.320

00:32.320 --> 00:34.040

00:34.040 --> 00:36.800
and her most recent book, Bittersweet,

This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.040
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:45.040 --> 00:46.560
in the description.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.240
And now, dear friends, here's Susan Cain.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.160
You've written on your website that, quote,

00:53.160 --> 00:55.440
I prefer listening to talking,

00:55.440 --> 00:57.200
reading to socializing,

00:57.200 --> 01:00.320
and cozy chats to group settings.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.120
So I think this conversation in the podcast

01:02.120 --> 01:03.240
is gonna be fun.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.920
What's a good definition of an introvert?

01:05.920 --> 01:10.280
Is something like those three things a good start?

01:10.280 --> 01:13.520
It is a good start in terms of how introverts

01:13.520 --> 01:15.300
experience day-to-day life.

01:16.280 --> 01:20.080
I think a good definition is one that some of your listeners

01:20.080 --> 01:21.840
will have heard many times before,

01:21.840 --> 01:24.380
the idea of where do you get your energy?

01:24.380 --> 01:26.500
And for some people, they get their energy more

01:26.500 --> 01:29.660
from quieter settings, and for other people,

01:29.660 --> 01:31.980
they get it more from being out there.

01:31.980 --> 01:35.060
So a good rule of thumb is to imagine

01:35.060 --> 01:36.980
that you're at a party that you're really enjoying,

01:36.980 --> 01:39.460
and you've been there for about two hours or so,

01:39.460 --> 01:41.320
and it's with people you really like,

01:41.320 --> 01:43.880
and it's in your favorite place, so it's all good.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.800
An extrovert in a setting like that

01:46.800 --> 01:49.220
is gonna feel charged up,

01:49.220 --> 01:51.460
and they're gonna be looking for the after party.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.020
And an introvert, no matter how good a time they're having

01:54.020 --> 01:55.860
and how socially skilled they are,

01:55.860 --> 01:58.020
there's this moment where you just wish

01:58.020 --> 02:00.700
that you could teleport and be back at home.

02:00.700 --> 02:03.820
Yeah, and at the time before the start of the party

02:03.820 --> 02:05.940
to the time when that moment happens

02:05.940 --> 02:07.180
is different for different people.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.380
So the shorter that is, the more of an introvert you are?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.720
Is that that kind of thing?

02:10.720 --> 02:13.220
The shorter the moment until you get to the place

02:13.220 --> 02:14.420
where you've gotta teleport home.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.820
I've gotta teleport home.

02:15.820 --> 02:18.580
Yeah, and then for extroverts, it's the opposite, right?

02:18.580 --> 02:22.620
They're gonna feel, maybe they're working on,

02:22.620 --> 02:25.100
I don't know, focused on producing a memo

02:25.100 --> 02:27.580
that's really intensely interesting to them.

02:27.580 --> 02:31.300
But if they're in that state of solitary,

02:31.300 --> 02:33.420
the solitary mode of really focusing,

02:33.420 --> 02:35.540
they might get stir crazy a lot faster

02:35.540 --> 02:37.100
than an introvert would.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.340
And so it doesn't have so much to do

02:38.340 --> 02:42.500
with what you're good at as how you get your energy.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.680
And so for an introvert, the source of energy

02:46.680 --> 02:47.520
is what?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.860
Silence, solitude, and for an extrovert,

02:50.900 --> 02:53.180
it's interaction with other people.

02:53.180 --> 02:54.580
What I'd really say is that,

02:54.580 --> 02:56.580
and this is neurobiological as well,

02:56.580 --> 02:59.960
is that it has to do with how your nervous system

02:59.960 --> 03:01.740
reacts to stimulation.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.620
So for an introvert, you're feeling

03:04.620 --> 03:06.380
in a great state of equilibrium

03:06.380 --> 03:09.460
when there are fewer inputs coming at you.

03:09.460 --> 03:10.960
So they could be social inputs,

03:10.960 --> 03:12.780
but that's why an introvert in general

03:12.780 --> 03:15.680
would rather hang out with one close friend at a time

03:15.680 --> 03:18.140
as opposed to a big party full of strangers

03:18.140 --> 03:21.060
because that's just too many inputs for the nervous system.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.880
And for an extrovert,

03:22.880 --> 03:24.540
the nervous system needs more stimulants.

03:24.540 --> 03:25.940
So if they're not getting enough,

03:25.940 --> 03:28.560
they get that listless and sluggish feeling.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.660
So if you're just walking through the world,

03:31.620 --> 03:33.180
like people listening to this,

03:33.180 --> 03:37.180
but in general, how do you know if you're an introvert?

03:37.180 --> 03:40.380
Like, how do you empirically start to determine

03:40.380 --> 03:43.620
if you are in large part an introvert?

03:43.620 --> 03:46.540
Well, I would start by just asking that question

03:46.540 --> 03:48.020
of what happens to you.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.740
You know, at around the two hour mark

03:49.740 --> 03:50.580
where you're having a good time.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.420
Go to parties.

03:51.420 --> 03:52.260
Yeah, I mean, imagine.

03:52.260 --> 03:53.980
But I also find,

03:53.980 --> 03:56.180
I'm curious if you have a different experience from this,

03:56.180 --> 03:58.860
but from all the years that I've been out there

03:58.860 --> 03:59.980
talking about this topic,

03:59.980 --> 04:04.340
I found that most people really seem to know

04:04.340 --> 04:06.180
once they're being honest with themselves.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.820
And maybe that's the question to ask is like,

04:08.820 --> 04:12.800
if you imagine that you have a Saturday or a whole weekend

04:12.800 --> 04:16.100
where you can spend your time exactly the way you want to

04:16.140 --> 04:20.100
with no professional obligations and no social obligations,

04:20.100 --> 04:21.340
who would you spend it with?

04:21.340 --> 04:22.620
How many people?

04:22.620 --> 04:24.360
What would you be doing?

04:24.360 --> 04:27.020
And what does that picture that you're painting

04:27.020 --> 04:28.180
start to look like?

04:29.160 --> 04:31.840
Yeah, so there's nuance to this though,

04:31.840 --> 04:35.060
because I'm sure for extroverts to get energized

04:35.060 --> 04:37.980
by stimulation, whether that's stimulation

04:37.980 --> 04:38.820
with other people,

04:38.820 --> 04:41.760
like it depends what that stimulation is, right?

04:41.760 --> 04:44.300
Like maybe you're not surrounded by the kind of people

04:44.300 --> 04:46.660
that you enjoy being around.

04:46.660 --> 04:50.980
So, you know, maybe that has to do less

04:50.980 --> 04:54.260
with whether some characteristics of your personality,

04:54.260 --> 04:55.700
more has to do with the fact

04:55.700 --> 04:57.300
of what your environment is like.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.700
That's always kind of the question.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.540
Do you want to be alone

05:00.540 --> 05:02.340
because everybody around you is an asshole

05:02.340 --> 05:03.300
or do you want to be alone

05:03.300 --> 05:05.460
because you get energized from being?

05:05.460 --> 05:07.900
Well, I would hold the variables constant, I guess.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.940
I would say, you know.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.740
Keep the assholes constant and see.

05:12.740 --> 05:15.140
And then there's the other thing you kind of observed

05:15.140 --> 05:17.300
that there's a lot of people

05:17.300 --> 05:20.500
that will say they get energized from being alone.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.780
Like people are exhausting to them or something like that.

05:24.780 --> 05:27.980
But at the same time, when you see them at a party,

05:27.980 --> 05:30.580
they seem like the life of the party.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.660
I know, and I hear from those people all the time.

05:33.660 --> 05:34.860
There's so many people like that.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.240
What would you classify them as exactly?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.600
Is it ultimately as the source of energy?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.820
Is it the most important thing?

05:41.420 --> 05:43.700
How the heck are they the life of the party?

05:43.700 --> 05:45.500
It's a bunch of different things.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.580
So first of all, just to say a big caveat to all of this

05:49.580 --> 05:52.620
is humans are just amazingly complex.

05:52.620 --> 05:55.900
So you can't explain every individual human

05:55.900 --> 05:56.860
through these parameters,

05:56.860 --> 05:59.700
even though I think the parameters are really valuable.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.420
But that person at the party,

06:01.420 --> 06:04.620
it could be that they're more of an ambivert.

06:04.620 --> 06:07.180
So they kind of are more in the middle of the spectrum.

06:07.180 --> 06:10.140
It basically means someone who's not extremely introverted

06:10.140 --> 06:12.540
or extremely extroverted, they're kind of in the middle.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.500
So maybe at a party,

06:13.500 --> 06:15.340
their more extroverted side comes out.

06:16.420 --> 06:20.140
Or it could be an introvert who's gotten really good

06:20.140 --> 06:23.420
at the skills of acting more like a pseudo extrovert

06:23.420 --> 06:26.940
and they pull that up at the moments that they need it.

06:26.940 --> 06:28.500
So they've learned how to fake it.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.660
Yeah, oh, there's a lot of people like that.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.660
And I know this because I think out of all the people

06:33.660 --> 06:35.220
on this planet you could be talking to,

06:35.220 --> 06:38.140
I've heard from the most number of those people.

06:38.180 --> 06:41.820
Like they all come and tell me about their experience

06:41.820 --> 06:44.180
out in the world presenting a face

06:44.180 --> 06:45.780
that's different from what they feel.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.900
So one of the things you talk about is,

06:47.900 --> 06:51.020
at least in the West we've constructed a picture of success

06:51.020 --> 06:55.220
and that picture is usually one of an extrovert.

06:55.220 --> 06:57.220
Like when you imagine somebody who's a leader,

06:57.220 --> 06:58.660
who's a successful person,

07:00.060 --> 07:01.980
that person has some of the qualities

07:01.980 --> 07:03.900
you would associate with an extrovert.

07:03.900 --> 07:07.300
And so there's a lot of incentive

07:07.340 --> 07:08.780
for faking it.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.820
Yeah, exactly.

07:11.820 --> 07:14.980
If you wanna be successful, you gotta be able to fake it,

07:14.980 --> 07:17.860
to sort of hang with the rest of the team.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.020
You have to be able to be outgoing

07:20.020 --> 07:21.340
and all those kinds of things

07:21.340 --> 07:23.740
and not be drained by the interaction.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.380
Yeah, but I mean, there are also a lot of introverts

07:26.380 --> 07:30.140
who figure out ways to draw on their own strengths

07:30.140 --> 07:33.820
and they're incredibly connecting and successful

07:33.820 --> 07:34.820
and they're great leaders

07:34.820 --> 07:36.660
and they're not actually faking it.

07:36.660 --> 07:40.020
They're more just figuring out ways to do it their own way.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.740
You see a lot of people like that.

07:42.620 --> 07:44.940
Is there advice, is there lessons you can draw from that

07:44.940 --> 07:47.900
from just observing how you can be an introvert

07:47.900 --> 07:49.540
and be in a leadership position?

07:50.460 --> 07:52.340
Yeah, it's kind of like a mantra

07:52.340 --> 07:53.900
of figuring out what your own strengths are

07:53.900 --> 07:55.780
and how to draw on them.

07:55.780 --> 07:59.940
I think of a guy I know, Doug Conant,

07:59.940 --> 08:04.060
who had been the CEO of Campbell's Soup for many years.

08:04.060 --> 08:06.340
He's very introverted.

08:06.340 --> 08:09.380
He's quite shy also by his own description

08:09.380 --> 08:13.740
and he really cares about people.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.580
And so when he started at Campbell,

08:18.580 --> 08:20.820
the employee engagement ratings of the company

08:20.820 --> 08:23.540
were all the way at the bottom of the Fortune 500.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.940
And by the time he stepped down 10 years later,

08:25.940 --> 08:27.540
they were all the way at the top.

08:27.540 --> 08:31.460
And it wasn't that he was going out there

08:31.460 --> 08:34.580
and schmoozing people, but he really did care.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.540
So he would find out who were the people

08:36.540 --> 08:38.460
who had really been contributing

08:38.460 --> 08:42.180
and he would write to them personal letters of thanks.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.460
And these letters meant so much to people.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.620
They would carry them around with them.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.500
And during his time, the 10 years there,

08:51.500 --> 08:54.580
he wrote 30,000 of those letters.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.780
So that was his way of doing it.

08:56.780 --> 08:58.860
That was his way of drawing on his own strengths.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.060
And he did that together with, of course,

09:02.060 --> 09:04.020
you sometimes have to go outside your comfort zone

09:04.020 --> 09:05.100
no matter who you are.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.100
So he was doing plenty of that too.

09:07.100 --> 09:08.540
It's a kind of combination.

09:08.540 --> 09:11.020
Yeah, the writing process

09:11.020 --> 09:14.100
and focusing on the one-on-one interaction,

09:14.100 --> 09:15.260
I can definitely relate.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.860
There's something deeply draining,

09:16.860 --> 09:19.500
which concerns me about Zoom meetings

09:19.500 --> 09:22.820
because it's some weird brain manipulation.

09:22.820 --> 09:23.660
Wait, say more.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.820
Well, because you're not really engaged,

09:26.820 --> 09:30.420
but it wears on you the same way that it does a party.

09:30.420 --> 09:35.420
It feels like you're emptying that bucket for the introverts

09:35.940 --> 09:38.860
even though they're not participating at all in the meeting.

09:38.860 --> 09:41.340
I mean, I suppose that's true for physical meetings too,

09:41.340 --> 09:43.620
but with Zoom meetings, remote meetings,

09:43.620 --> 09:46.340
it's so much easier to invite a larger number of people

09:46.340 --> 09:47.500
into the meeting.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.380
So you're draining more and more of the introvert energy.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.780
And I'm probably extrovert too,

09:51.780 --> 09:54.460
but the introvert definitely, I mean, it's interesting.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.300
I would love to understand that more

09:56.300 --> 09:59.300
because there's more and more push towards remote work.

10:00.460 --> 10:02.900
Without, I think, a deep understanding

10:02.900 --> 10:05.380
of why these meetings are so draining on people.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.020
I just anecdotally have heard from that,

10:08.020 --> 10:10.060
but maybe that's because the managers,

10:10.060 --> 10:11.860
the people who arrange the meetings

10:11.860 --> 10:14.660
are just not sufficiently yet aware

10:14.660 --> 10:16.300
of the draining nature of them

10:16.300 --> 10:18.220
so that they pull in too many people,

10:18.220 --> 10:19.620
they schedule them too regularly,

10:19.620 --> 10:21.900
so they need to adjust that kind of thing probably.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.820
I think people are starting to realize,

10:23.820 --> 10:27.660
but I would say one reason that Zoom is so draining

10:27.660 --> 10:32.660
is because you can see your own self-presentation

10:33.180 --> 10:35.340
the whole time if you choose to.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.740
And when you go into in-person, you can't,

10:38.740 --> 10:41.140
so you're kind of freed of thinking about that.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.740
So it's like an extra cognitive load

10:42.740 --> 10:44.700
that you're bearing the whole time.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.060
Oh yeah, that's brilliant.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.940
And you might wanna turn off the camera

10:49.940 --> 10:51.300
so you can't see yourself, but then you feel like,

10:51.300 --> 10:53.140
well, I have the ability to,

10:53.140 --> 10:54.700
so I probably should be doing it.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.020
And then that alone is a decision that you're making.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.220
Yeah, there's probably studies on this now happening,

11:00.220 --> 11:02.700
either have happened or are happening,

11:02.700 --> 11:07.700
the effect of seeing your own face on camera,

11:08.020 --> 11:08.860
because it's reminding you

11:08.860 --> 11:10.580
that you're supposed to be acting a certain way,

11:10.580 --> 11:13.580
and that is especially a stressful thing.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.620
Yeah, you can't be in the moment as much.

11:15.620 --> 11:18.300
But I mean, for you, you make the decision

11:18.300 --> 11:21.980
to do all your podcast interviews in person, right?

11:22.940 --> 11:26.100
And that's even when it's very costly.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.580
If there's any kind of chemistry that contributes at all

11:30.580 --> 11:31.420
to the conversation,

11:31.420 --> 11:34.140
which I think most conversations have chemistry,

11:34.140 --> 11:38.180
even the boring work meetings, there's something there.

11:38.180 --> 11:41.020
Because yes, you're trying to solve a particular problem

11:41.020 --> 11:44.180
at this particular time, but underneath it,

11:44.180 --> 11:46.140
there's a team building that's happening.

11:46.140 --> 11:50.540
And honestly, people also have told me about this,

11:50.540 --> 11:54.940
why they enjoy the Zoom meetings during the pandemic,

11:54.940 --> 11:56.100
is they're lonely.

11:59.380 --> 12:02.340
It's annoying to have to sit and listen to folks

12:02.340 --> 12:03.820
talk about nothing and so on,

12:03.820 --> 12:05.900
but they tune in anyway,

12:05.900 --> 12:09.180
because it's kind of lonely to sit there by yourself.

12:09.180 --> 12:13.780
And there's a deep connection there with other people,

12:13.780 --> 12:17.460
and that is especially true when they're there in person,

12:17.460 --> 12:18.820
which is a huge concern for me

12:18.820 --> 12:23.620
for more and more offices from a capitalist perspective,

12:23.620 --> 12:27.300
realizing, hey, why do we have these large office spaces?

12:27.300 --> 12:28.860
Why do we have to get people together?

12:28.860 --> 12:32.100
But I think in some deep sense, we do.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.660
But then you also talk about that once we do,

12:34.660 --> 12:38.180
we wanna protect the introverts.

12:38.180 --> 12:42.260
Like you don't want the open office space,

12:42.260 --> 12:43.780
which was a big fad for a while.

12:43.780 --> 12:46.460
I don't know where people stand on that at this point.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.940
And I think people are figuring it out

12:47.940 --> 12:52.300
in a post-pandemic context, but I mean, I knew what you mean.

12:52.300 --> 12:55.100
So before I became a writer,

12:55.100 --> 12:57.780
I was a corporate lawyer for like seven years.

12:57.780 --> 13:02.420
And literally the only thing I miss from those years

13:02.420 --> 13:06.420
is hanging out with people at the office.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.140
Like, I don't know, just some of the funniest moments

13:09.140 --> 13:12.700
I've had in my life came from being at the office

13:12.700 --> 13:15.020
until midnight with the other people I was working with.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.540
So I know exactly what you're talking about.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.180
Though I will say the office is there at that firm

13:19.180 --> 13:20.740
and at most firms in those days,

13:20.740 --> 13:22.220
everybody had their own office.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.700
So it was like a dorm room,

13:23.700 --> 13:24.980
where it was like a long hallway

13:24.980 --> 13:27.580
with everybody in their own little dorm room.

13:27.580 --> 13:30.340
So you had tons of privacy, but you would also come out

13:30.340 --> 13:31.940
and hang out with people.

13:31.940 --> 13:32.780
And I think that-

13:32.780 --> 13:34.660
You could just kind of roam whenever you want.

13:34.660 --> 13:35.500
Yeah, yeah.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.740
And whenever you roam, that means you're kind of open.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.780
You're looking for trouble.

13:40.780 --> 13:41.620
Yeah.

13:41.620 --> 13:42.460
You're open for interaction.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.580
And the extent to which you would keep your door open,

13:45.100 --> 13:47.660
was it wide open or was it half a jar or just a little bit?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.500
Those were all signals.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.260
So is there, cause you said re-energize,

13:51.260 --> 13:53.060
is there, do you like to think,

13:53.060 --> 13:54.820
and again, the human mind is complicated,

13:54.820 --> 13:57.180
but do you like to think of it as like a bucket

13:57.180 --> 14:00.700
that gets refilled for introverts in terms of energy,

14:00.700 --> 14:05.700
of social interaction that they're able to handle?

14:07.540 --> 14:09.500
Do you think of it like that,

14:09.500 --> 14:12.260
as a bucket that gets emptied and needs to be refilled?

14:12.260 --> 14:13.540
I think of it, yeah, more or less,

14:13.540 --> 14:15.380
cause I use the metaphor of a battery

14:15.380 --> 14:16.900
that gets recharged or not.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.900
It's basically the same thing, different metaphor.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.020
But yeah, but just to add on that,

14:22.020 --> 14:24.020
there is a layer of complexity to that

14:24.020 --> 14:29.020
because you could be somebody who doesn't want

14:30.540 --> 14:32.260
the kind of social life, let's say,

14:32.260 --> 14:35.100
where you have to be like on and presenting

14:35.100 --> 14:37.140
and interacting with tons of people all the time,

14:37.140 --> 14:40.020
but you'd get really lonely if you were just by yourself.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.380
So what you want is to maybe be in the company

14:42.380 --> 14:44.780
of a couple people you know really well.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.620
Like for me, the pandemic was not actually that hard

14:47.620 --> 14:48.540
for me personally.

14:48.540 --> 14:50.580
I mean, I lost family, but I mean,

14:50.580 --> 14:52.700
from the point of view of what we're talking about,

14:52.700 --> 14:55.460
it wasn't that hard because I live with my husband

14:55.460 --> 14:57.060
and my kids.

14:57.060 --> 15:00.140
So I knew it was hard on the kids and I felt badly for them.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.940
But for me, I was like, you know what?

15:02.940 --> 15:05.860
I have a lot of social life right here in the house.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.300
And I can focus and do my work.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.780
Yeah.

15:09.780 --> 15:11.980
That's the cool thing about the pandemic.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.460
I think it helped people figure out

15:13.460 --> 15:14.860
how much they love their family.

15:14.860 --> 15:16.260
I think that's true.

15:16.260 --> 15:17.700
And a lot of you give you a chance

15:17.700 --> 15:19.900
to really reconnect with kids,

15:19.900 --> 15:22.180
with your kids, like really spend time with them.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.340
It's just fascinating to watch.

15:23.340 --> 15:26.900
Like people actually, it did strengthen the family unit

15:26.900 --> 15:29.980
in an often beautiful way,

15:30.980 --> 15:34.540
which just sucks to have to leave behind at this point.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.300
Yeah, and I think that's part of what people

15:36.300 --> 15:39.580
are not gonna wanna go back to that we need to solve for

15:40.140 --> 15:44.060
to the extent that work becomes non-remote again.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.180
I think people have just realized

15:45.180 --> 15:47.380
how precious those aspects of their lives are.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.860
And for somebody who's in a sort of conventional office job

15:51.860 --> 15:53.780
where you're going home and seeing your kids

15:53.780 --> 15:56.060
for an hour before bedtime,

15:56.060 --> 15:58.020
and that's your interaction with them,

15:58.020 --> 16:01.420
that's kind of a ridiculous way to set things up.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.620
It's cool that you can get,

16:02.620 --> 16:04.980
I think a lot of places give you the option now,

16:04.980 --> 16:05.900
which is interesting.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.380
You get to optimize that element of your life.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.100
Do you take the commute and the office work

16:10.100 --> 16:11.380
and then the social interaction there?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.780
Do you focus on the work at home?

16:13.780 --> 16:16.300
It's also lonely at home, but then you get to see your kids.

16:16.300 --> 16:19.300
If you have kids, that's part of the optimization

16:19.300 --> 16:21.660
is like, I have some options now

16:21.660 --> 16:26.660
and I'm gonna try to optimize solitude, loneliness,

16:28.100 --> 16:33.100
happiness, productivity, seeing family, seeing coworkers,

16:34.860 --> 16:36.820
the chemistry with the team building with the coworkers

16:36.820 --> 16:40.340
versus just the raw exchange of information

16:40.340 --> 16:41.300
with the coworkers.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.620
It's fascinating to see how that kind of evolves.

16:44.620 --> 16:48.500
Yeah, and then there's the third space idea

16:48.500 --> 16:52.620
of the spaces where you're in a coworking space

16:52.620 --> 16:54.180
or a cafe or something like that.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.660
So you've got other people around you,

16:55.660 --> 16:58.300
but you're not exactly interacting with them,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.420
but they're very much there.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.100
And that's huge too.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.340
I don't think we think about that enough.

17:04.340 --> 17:06.300
Yeah, that energy's there.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.340
Yeah, yeah.

17:07.340 --> 17:11.780
I lived in Manhattan for 17 years before we had kids

17:11.780 --> 17:15.500
and I absolutely loved it.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.660
I loved it, the feeling of all that energy all around you,

17:18.660 --> 17:21.180
but you could be anonymous within it.

17:21.180 --> 17:22.260
To me, it was perfect.

17:22.260 --> 17:23.100
Yeah, it's beautiful.

17:23.100 --> 17:26.220
I worked this morning for a few hours,

17:26.220 --> 17:28.540
programmed for a few hours at a Starbucks.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.860
And first of all, wearing suits,

17:32.860 --> 17:35.380
Manhattan is the one place you can kind of fit into that

17:35.420 --> 17:36.740
because everyone's wearing suits.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.740
Do you wear suits every day?

17:38.740 --> 17:41.380
Well, these days, unfortunately, because I get recognized,

17:41.380 --> 17:45.540
I wear usually not suits when I just on my own life.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.740
But yeah, I love it.

17:46.740 --> 17:48.860
I love the way it feels, I don't know.

17:48.860 --> 17:51.380
And the way I think about the world when I wear a suit,

17:51.380 --> 17:54.620
I take it seriously as if my life is gonna end today.

17:54.620 --> 17:56.940
Like this is what I would want to wear,

17:56.940 --> 17:58.780
not for physical appearance,

17:58.780 --> 18:02.900
but just for some reason it makes me feel like focused.

18:02.900 --> 18:03.740
I don't know.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.180
So even if you're not gonna see anyone,

18:05.980 --> 18:07.100
you would still put the suit on when you're doing your work?

18:07.100 --> 18:07.940
Especially then.

18:07.940 --> 18:08.780
Really?

18:08.780 --> 18:10.500
Especially then, yeah.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.660
Yeah, I really love doing that.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.940
So it tells you seriousness of purpose,

18:14.940 --> 18:15.780
something like that?

18:15.780 --> 18:16.620
Yeah, yeah.

18:16.620 --> 18:17.780
Like everything is elevated now.

18:17.780 --> 18:18.620
I don't know what it is.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.060
I don't know what I imagined exactly,

18:20.060 --> 18:23.660
but it's some kind of platonic form

18:23.660 --> 18:27.940
of like a mixture of James Bond and like,

18:27.940 --> 18:30.420
I don't know who else, Richard Feynman,

18:30.420 --> 18:32.260
can I think about when I think about a suit?

18:32.260 --> 18:33.620
You know, I think of Leonard Cohen,

18:33.660 --> 18:37.060
but he was always wearing suits too, but you know.

18:37.060 --> 18:38.740
Leonard Cohen is definitely one of my,

18:38.740 --> 18:42.260
is a tragic human, is a beautiful human being.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.540
Through his words, through his own private life,

18:44.540 --> 18:47.540
yes, I definitely would think about Leonard Cohen.

18:49.580 --> 18:53.940
So small talk, that's another thing.

18:55.660 --> 18:59.220
Is that part of the equation of introvert versus extrovert?

18:59.220 --> 19:01.100
How much people enjoy small talk?

19:01.100 --> 19:03.140
I kind of went into this whole thing

19:03.140 --> 19:04.820
thinking that it was,

19:04.820 --> 19:07.980
but from what I've seen, most people have studies

19:07.980 --> 19:10.020
that most people don't like small talk.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.860
I think that's why people like your podcasts,

19:12.860 --> 19:14.860
because you're like, forget the small talk,

19:14.860 --> 19:17.460
I'm going deep into it from the very beginning.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.580
Yeah, so it's actually, the picture you're painting

19:19.580 --> 19:23.180
is like the way you started, like with your,

19:23.180 --> 19:26.980
with the book Quiet, and the way you are today

19:26.980 --> 19:30.700
is you realize the picture may be more complicated.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.500
Yeah, everything's more complicated.

19:33.980 --> 19:37.980
I will say with the small talk thing that,

19:39.540 --> 19:41.060
I'm curious if you have this experience,

19:41.060 --> 19:44.740
but I find it fantastic to have a career

19:44.740 --> 19:49.740
where I'm known for anti-small talk kinds of topics,

19:50.500 --> 19:52.540
because it means that anywhere I go,

19:52.540 --> 19:55.020
like if I show up at a conference or something like that,

19:55.020 --> 19:56.660
no one does small talk with me.

19:56.660 --> 20:00.020
They're like telling me about the deep truth of their lives

20:00.020 --> 20:03.100
from the first hello, and I love that.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.460
And in normal life, you have to like wade through a lot

20:06.460 --> 20:08.300
before you know if people are ready to go there.

20:09.940 --> 20:11.460
Do you have that experience too?

20:11.460 --> 20:14.780
No, definitely, definitely with people that know me for sure.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.380
But you forget how many people feel like they know you

20:17.380 --> 20:18.700
because of your podcasts.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.340
Oh, that's what, no, that counts.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.740
Because I'm a huge fan of podcasts,

20:21.740 --> 20:26.740
and I feel like before I ever became friends with Joe Rogan,

20:27.060 --> 20:28.420
I felt like I was friends with him,

20:28.420 --> 20:30.660
because I was a fan of his podcast.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.180
I feel like it's a friendship.

20:33.180 --> 20:34.620
I know it's a one-way friendship

20:34.620 --> 20:37.100
with all the people I listen to in podcasts,

20:37.100 --> 20:41.020
and even people who are no longer with us, like writers.

20:41.020 --> 20:42.420
I feel like I have a relationship with them.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.340
Maybe I'm insane.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.140
No, I totally feel that way.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.820
That's the whole reason I became a writer.

20:46.820 --> 20:48.420
Like I'm friends with Leonard Cohen.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.260
Yeah.

20:50.820 --> 20:52.060
And he's not aware of it.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.300
No, but I think that's the whole reason for writing

20:57.300 --> 20:59.500
or making music or whatever people do.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.940
To be able to have those kinds of connections

21:02.940 --> 21:06.140
that don't require having to be in a room together,

21:06.140 --> 21:07.780
because there's only so many people

21:07.780 --> 21:10.780
you can be in a room with in your lifetime.

21:10.780 --> 21:15.780
The hard thing is, unfortunately,

21:15.940 --> 21:18.100
because I value human connections so much,

21:19.580 --> 21:21.940
and I only have, just like you mentioned,

21:21.940 --> 21:25.420
sort of a small circle of people I'm really close with

21:25.420 --> 21:28.020
by design, it always hurts me a lot

21:28.020 --> 21:29.380
to say goodbye to people.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.740
Like you meet people and you can tell

21:31.740 --> 21:32.740
they're beautiful people.

21:32.740 --> 21:33.580
They're amazing.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.580
There's something so fascinating about them.

21:38.740 --> 21:40.140
They've had a complicated life,

21:40.140 --> 21:41.500
like you could see in their eyes

21:41.500 --> 21:44.740
and the way they tell their story in just a few sentences.

21:44.740 --> 21:45.940
They've gone through some shit,

21:45.940 --> 21:49.020
but they've also found some elements of beauty,

21:49.020 --> 21:50.780
and then you get to realize,

21:50.780 --> 21:52.980
okay, well, there's a fascinating human here,

21:52.980 --> 21:55.540
and all you get to say is a few words here and there,

21:55.540 --> 22:00.180
like a funny little joke, maybe a dark joke here and there,

22:00.180 --> 22:03.220
and then you just say goodbye, maybe hug it out,

22:03.220 --> 22:04.340
and you go on your way.

22:04.340 --> 22:06.100
So that's a hello and a goodbye,

22:06.100 --> 22:08.020
and your paths will never cross again.

22:08.020 --> 22:13.020
That makes me a sad walk away.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.860
But I guess I wouldn't have it any other way,

22:14.860 --> 22:16.740
I suppose, as the reality is.

22:16.740 --> 22:20.540
In your book, you talk about that sorrow,

22:20.540 --> 22:22.940
that sadness not being such a bad thing.

22:22.940 --> 22:25.980
Yeah, and when you just said that,

22:25.980 --> 22:29.020
I just thought of this one moment in my life

22:29.020 --> 22:32.580
that I haven't thought of for 20, 30 years or something,

22:32.580 --> 22:34.140
but it was when I was in law school,

22:34.140 --> 22:38.900
and a classmate of mine had his friend come to visit

22:38.900 --> 22:40.980
for the weekend, and the three of us hung out a lot,

22:40.980 --> 22:44.460
and we just had an amazing time,

22:44.460 --> 22:47.700
and then this other guy who wasn't going to be coming back

22:47.700 --> 22:51.980
anytime soon, if at all, sent a postcard to me,

22:51.980 --> 22:54.100
and the only thing written on the postcard

22:54.100 --> 22:55.860
was this quote from Oscar Wilde,

22:55.860 --> 22:57.180
and I don't remember the exact words,

22:57.180 --> 23:00.300
but it basically said that there's no pain as intense

23:00.300 --> 23:03.580
as the sorrow of parting from someone

23:03.580 --> 23:05.940
to whom you've just been introduced.

23:05.940 --> 23:06.860
Yeah.

23:06.860 --> 23:09.260
And there was something so intense about that,

23:09.260 --> 23:10.700
and so true.

23:10.700 --> 23:13.020
I think partly also because when you've just been introduced

23:13.020 --> 23:18.020
to somebody, you don't yet know their difficulties,

23:18.420 --> 23:22.220
so you're seeing the most sparkling version of them.

23:22.220 --> 23:26.540
You're seeing a platonic version of love and friendship.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.420
And your imagination fills in the rest

23:28.420 --> 23:31.020
in some beautiful way that matches perfectly

23:31.020 --> 23:32.980
the kind of thing you're interested in.

23:32.980 --> 23:36.980
It's how I feel about one spoonful of ice cream,

23:36.980 --> 23:39.860
and that's why you always finish the whole tub,

23:39.860 --> 23:41.340
and you regret all of it.

23:43.740 --> 23:45.420
What did you write this?

23:45.420 --> 23:46.980
I think this is on your website,

23:47.020 --> 23:48.580
that one of the best things in the world

23:48.580 --> 23:52.180
is that sublime moment when a writer, artist, or musician

23:52.180 --> 23:54.980
manages to express something you've always felt,

23:54.980 --> 23:56.260
but never articulated,

23:56.260 --> 23:58.500
or at least never quite so beautifully.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.340
So that's the Oscar Wilde line is one line like that,

24:01.340 --> 24:06.340
but just a line from a song or maybe a piece of art

24:06.780 --> 24:07.620
that just grabs you.

24:07.620 --> 24:09.940
Is there something that jumps out into memory

24:09.940 --> 24:11.820
like that for you?

24:11.820 --> 24:14.020
I don't know if I have an exact line, though.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.620
I mean, that feeling that you just quoted happens to me

24:16.620 --> 24:17.460
all the time.

24:17.460 --> 24:19.660
I'm just bad at recalling exact instances.

24:19.660 --> 24:22.780
Me too, on the spot.

24:22.780 --> 24:25.060
But the writer Alain de Botton

24:25.060 --> 24:27.500
regularly makes me feel that way.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.980
He's just this beautiful essayist

24:29.980 --> 24:31.940
and observer of human nature,

24:31.940 --> 24:34.180
and he's just constantly expressing things

24:34.180 --> 24:37.620
in this gorgeous way that you've experienced yourself.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.740
And you feel like, I don't know,

24:39.740 --> 24:41.860
it's just this grand act of generosity.

24:41.860 --> 24:43.140
You feel less lonely,

24:43.140 --> 24:45.860
you feel like this deep sense of communion.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.300
It's such an elevating experience.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.660
Even when it's like a melancholy line.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.260
Maybe especially when it is.

24:52.260 --> 24:53.260
Yeah, what is that?

24:54.900 --> 24:59.260
There's, so Jack Kerouac, On the Road

24:59.260 --> 25:01.220
definitely makes me feel that way,

25:01.220 --> 25:02.860
like every other line in there.

25:03.740 --> 25:05.780
Forlorn rags of growing old.

25:05.780 --> 25:06.900
Do you know, I never read that book.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.140
So what was it about that book

25:09.140 --> 25:11.060
that made you feel that way?

25:11.060 --> 25:13.460
Well, okay, well, since you asked.

25:13.460 --> 25:14.300
I do, I do.

25:14.460 --> 25:16.100
I'm going to linger on this.

25:17.620 --> 25:21.380
So this story is kind of the book,

25:21.380 --> 25:24.980
the kind of defining book of the beats,

25:24.980 --> 25:26.460
of the beat generation.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.460
And it's basically a story of a writer

25:29.460 --> 25:32.860
who takes a road trip across the United States

25:32.860 --> 25:34.620
a couple of times,

25:34.620 --> 25:37.060
and experiences a few close friends

25:37.060 --> 25:39.220
and a few strangers along the way.

25:39.220 --> 25:40.620
And there's a lot of just

25:40.620 --> 25:43.260
those melancholy goodbyes along the way.

25:43.260 --> 25:46.140
You meet all these people with interesting lives.

25:46.140 --> 25:47.620
Some of them are defined by struggle.

25:47.620 --> 25:49.900
Some of them are defined by drugs,

25:49.900 --> 25:52.140
drinking, women, all that kind of stuff.

25:52.140 --> 25:55.140
And still he just kind of dances around all of that

25:55.140 --> 25:58.940
and is defined by the goodbyes and the passing of time.

25:58.940 --> 26:00.620
So a lot of the really powerful lines

26:00.620 --> 26:04.340
are basically like, there's one on there.

26:04.340 --> 26:05.620
Again, I don't remember exactly,

26:05.620 --> 26:10.620
but he meets a beautiful girl at a rest stop.

26:10.900 --> 26:14.660
And the girl is getting,

26:14.660 --> 26:17.100
or a woman is getting on a different bus

26:17.100 --> 26:18.500
than he's getting on.

26:18.500 --> 26:23.500
And it's that feeling of falling in love for a second

26:27.140 --> 26:30.820
and realizing that fate is just ripping that out,

26:30.820 --> 26:34.100
which is similar to this idea of,

26:34.100 --> 26:36.500
it sucks to say goodbye just when you met,

26:36.500 --> 26:38.420
but it's especially true when you fall in love

26:38.420 --> 26:39.860
just a little bit with that stranger,

26:39.860 --> 26:43.660
with all the possibilities that could lay there.

26:44.540 --> 26:48.220
So there's a few lines I've written down.

26:48.220 --> 26:50.100
I went down this whole rabbit hole of thinking,

26:50.100 --> 26:52.260
one of the lines that grabbed me,

26:52.260 --> 26:53.780
a couple of lines from On the Road.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.180
So one is, what is that feeling

26:56.180 --> 26:58.260
when you're driving away from people

26:58.260 --> 26:59.620
and they recede on the plane

26:59.620 --> 27:01.980
till you see their specks dispersing?

27:01.980 --> 27:05.300
It's the two huge world vaulting us and it's goodbye,

27:05.300 --> 27:07.500
but we'll lean forward to the next crazy venture

27:07.500 --> 27:08.660
beneath the skies.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.580
So this is him talking about leaving a particular city.

27:11.580 --> 27:14.740
The, spoiler alert, towards the end of the book,

27:14.740 --> 27:16.500
rather the end of the book,

27:16.500 --> 27:18.140
line I return too often.

27:19.340 --> 27:21.460
It's more poetry, but it's the feeling

27:21.460 --> 27:23.260
that captures the book, I would say.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.300
The evening star must be drooping

27:27.300 --> 27:30.620
and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie,

27:30.620 --> 27:32.740
which is just before the coming of complete night

27:32.740 --> 27:36.020
that blesses the earth, darkens all the rivers,

27:36.020 --> 27:38.860
cups the peaks and folds the final shore in.

27:38.860 --> 27:42.660
And nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody

27:42.660 --> 27:45.220
besides the forlorn rags of growing old.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.660
And it just captures this kind of,

27:49.660 --> 27:53.780
in the moment, appreciation of the beauty of the world

27:53.780 --> 27:56.660
and a sadness over the fact that time passes

27:56.660 --> 27:58.620
and you leave the people you love behind,

27:58.620 --> 28:01.540
you leave the places you love behind,

28:01.540 --> 28:03.340
or at least the way they were

28:03.340 --> 28:04.820
at the time that you really enjoyed them.

28:04.820 --> 28:06.540
And you just leave all that,

28:06.540 --> 28:08.620
just the sadness you feel when you,

28:08.620 --> 28:10.980
something about it, like looking at a picture,

28:10.980 --> 28:12.780
looking at your kids grow up,

28:12.780 --> 28:15.140
looking at old friends getting old.

28:15.140 --> 28:18.460
Something makes you realize that time passes.

28:18.460 --> 28:19.860
And somewhere deep in there

28:19.860 --> 28:22.180
is probably a realization of your mortality.

28:22.180 --> 28:25.180
And then it just makes you somehow first sad

28:25.180 --> 28:28.500
that everything comes to an end.

28:28.500 --> 28:33.300
And then that's immediately followed

28:33.300 --> 28:35.140
by sort of an appreciation of the moment,

28:35.140 --> 28:37.820
like a gratitude that you get to experience this moment.

28:37.820 --> 28:39.140
Yeah, I know it exactly.

28:39.140 --> 28:42.460
I mean, that's the whole reason that I wrote Bitter Sweet.

28:42.460 --> 28:43.500
It's all about that.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.780
So I know intensely what you're talking about.

28:46.780 --> 28:49.100
And by the way, my husband loves the book,

28:49.100 --> 28:50.980
A Movable Feast by Ernest Hemingway,

28:50.980 --> 28:52.100
which I also haven't read,

28:52.100 --> 28:54.100
but it talks about that same thing.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.580
Groups of people traveling around together

28:56.580 --> 29:00.260
and the group coalesces into some magical formation.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.740
And then one person leaves the group

29:01.740 --> 29:03.740
and it's never gonna be the same again.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.180
And then they move on to the next one.

29:06.180 --> 29:09.780
Yeah, I mean, I think that's the deepest essence

29:09.780 --> 29:12.060
of human nature.

29:13.540 --> 29:17.060
The feeling of longing for some kind of state

29:17.060 --> 29:21.420
of perfect completeness, completion, perfect love,

29:21.420 --> 29:23.060
the Garden of Eden, all of it.

29:23.900 --> 29:27.980
And the feeling that you're never gonna quite attain it,

29:27.980 --> 29:30.180
but you get glimpses of it here and there.

29:30.180 --> 29:32.220
And that those glimpses are some of the best things

29:32.220 --> 29:33.380
that ever happened to us.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.900
And they're suffused with sadness

29:34.900 --> 29:36.660
because they're not the real thing

29:36.660 --> 29:37.780
or they're not the full thing.

29:37.780 --> 29:39.540
They're just a glimpse.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.300
It's a glimpse of what we long for.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.060
So the sadness that we might feel

29:46.940 --> 29:49.980
is always connected to the ways in which we fall short

29:49.980 --> 29:52.340
from the perfect thing that we're,

29:52.340 --> 29:54.740
like there's always a thing you're longing for.

29:55.860 --> 29:59.660
And the sadness has to do with getting a glimpse of it,

29:59.660 --> 30:01.820
but not quite getting a hold of it.

30:01.820 --> 30:03.100
Yeah, yeah.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.820
So it's always losing.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.340
It's always losing, but it's also always,

30:07.340 --> 30:09.300
but it's not, that sounds really depressing,

30:09.300 --> 30:11.780
but it's not, you know it's not depressing

30:11.780 --> 30:13.180
because you experience this all the time.

30:13.180 --> 30:16.540
It's also, those are the most beautiful moments

30:16.540 --> 30:18.380
I think life offers.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.500
I mean, it's intense, intense beauty in those moments

30:22.380 --> 30:24.300
because it's getting closer

30:24.300 --> 30:26.860
to the real thing that we long for.

30:26.860 --> 30:31.460
So what about like loss, losing love?

30:31.460 --> 30:36.460
Is that also a beautiful thing?

30:36.940 --> 30:40.860
Well, the moments you're talking about,

30:40.860 --> 30:44.900
I think it's easier to appreciate the beauty of it all

30:44.900 --> 30:48.460
in the moment because you're experiencing,

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
you're kind of experiencing the loss and the love

30:51.500 --> 30:52.780
all at the same time.

30:53.740 --> 30:55.900
Whereas if you're talking about straight up loss,

30:55.900 --> 31:00.580
like a betrayal or a bereavement or whatever it is,

31:00.580 --> 31:04.140
that's, it's different, it's quite overwhelming.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.860
So losing loved one kind of thing.

31:06.860 --> 31:07.900
Losing a loved one.

31:07.900 --> 31:12.380
I mean, I will say that the truth that I think

31:12.380 --> 31:16.780
that we can come to after a lot of time on this earth

31:16.780 --> 31:20.700
is the idea that love exists not only

31:20.700 --> 31:24.300
in its particular forms, so not only in the form

31:24.300 --> 31:28.060
of the one person, you know, that one person we love

31:28.060 --> 31:31.660
or that other person we love, but love itself is a state

31:31.660 --> 31:33.260
that we have access to.

31:33.260 --> 31:38.260
And so over time, the loss of person A can heal

31:38.580 --> 31:42.620
and you can tap into a kind of bigger river of love.

31:43.460 --> 31:47.820
Yeah, I mean, I had this, it comes from Louis C.K.

31:47.820 --> 31:50.340
He had a show, damn, I love that line.

31:50.340 --> 31:53.140
I mean, there's a, he's talks to an older gentleman

31:54.460 --> 31:59.460
and Louis is all like sad about losing a loved one

32:01.820 --> 32:04.580
or like getting rejected essentially, like a breakup.

32:05.580 --> 32:09.620
And then the older gentleman gives him advice saying like,

32:11.500 --> 32:13.340
basically criticizes Louis for saying,

32:13.340 --> 32:15.220
why are you moping around?

32:15.220 --> 32:17.980
Because this is the most, this is the best part.

32:17.980 --> 32:21.460
Like losing love is the best part because that's,

32:21.460 --> 32:23.460
the real loss is when you forget.

32:24.780 --> 32:28.140
Like feeling shitty about having gone through a breakup

32:29.740 --> 32:32.860
is when you most intensely appreciate

32:32.860 --> 32:34.380
what that person meant to you.

32:35.620 --> 32:40.340
Like you most intensely feel love in some strange way

32:40.340 --> 32:43.340
by realizing that you've lost it, by missing it,

32:43.340 --> 32:46.660
wishing at this moment, I wish I had that,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.420
like that feeling that that's when you feel

32:49.420 --> 32:52.060
that love the most, the absence of it.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.140
And so the older gentleman gives advice

32:55.140 --> 32:57.020
that that's the best part.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.780
And it can, if you're good with it,

32:58.780 --> 33:00.140
it can last for the longest.

33:01.460 --> 33:05.580
It could be the most sort of prolonged experience

33:05.580 --> 33:09.420
of deep appreciation and emotion and so on.

33:09.420 --> 33:14.180
So that's kind of a, that's a nice way to look at loss,

33:14.940 --> 33:18.580
which is a reminder of how much somebody meant to us.

33:18.580 --> 33:22.140
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of truth in that

33:23.700 --> 33:26.180
because yeah, you wouldn't care so much

33:26.180 --> 33:27.700
if it weren't something that mattered to you.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.260
So it's always a signpost to the direction

33:30.260 --> 33:33.500
you really want to go to and that's always what it is.

33:34.860 --> 33:37.140
Yeah, and it's interesting to see the way

33:37.140 --> 33:42.140
that the mystical versions of many of the great religions

33:43.620 --> 33:45.420
all point in this direction.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.260
You know, whether you're looking at Sufism

33:47.260 --> 33:50.340
or the Kabbalah or in Christian mysticism,

33:50.340 --> 33:54.860
you see this idea that the longing for what you lack

33:54.860 --> 33:58.300
is the very thing that gives you what you're longing for.

33:58.300 --> 33:59.740
So the longing is the cure.

33:59.740 --> 34:02.740
I mean, that's the way the Sufi poet Rumi puts it,

34:02.740 --> 34:04.500
the longing is the cure.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.780
You know, and he says, be thirsty,

34:05.780 --> 34:08.460
like be as thirsty as you possibly can.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.900
That's what you want to be.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.300
The good stuff is the wanting, not the having.

34:14.060 --> 34:15.660
Yeah, yeah.

34:15.740 --> 34:17.900
Of course, tell that to a person that just broke up

34:17.900 --> 34:20.580
and they'll be like, shut up, asshole.

34:20.580 --> 34:24.780
Advice sucks, I wish I had her or him back.

34:24.780 --> 34:26.300
Yeah, no, absolutely.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.700
Those are the kinds of life lessons that only work

34:29.700 --> 34:31.620
when you kind of step away for a while.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.340
They don't work in the moment, in the moment of excruciation.

34:35.340 --> 34:39.260
There is something about the fact of knowing

34:39.260 --> 34:42.540
that all humans are in that experience together

34:42.540 --> 34:45.620
that is also incredibly uplifting.

34:46.740 --> 34:49.580
Well, that takes time for people to realize.

34:49.580 --> 34:54.380
Like, you know, like heartbreak in your early teenage years

34:54.380 --> 34:56.300
or something like that could feel like

34:56.300 --> 34:59.260
this is completely the most novel

34:59.260 --> 35:04.260
and the most dramatic pain that any human has ever felt,

35:04.460 --> 35:07.020
right, or maybe even when you're younger.

35:07.020 --> 35:10.620
And then one of the process, one of the things you realize

35:10.620 --> 35:13.020
is that everybody goes through this.

35:13.020 --> 35:14.900
That can be an awakening to the fact

35:14.900 --> 35:16.500
that we're all in this together.

35:16.500 --> 35:19.740
This human condition is not just a personal experience,

35:19.740 --> 35:21.580
it's an experience we all share.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.980
And that's a kind of love, the unity of it.

35:24.980 --> 35:27.580
Yeah, that's a really deep kind of love.

35:27.580 --> 35:29.900
And I feel like, you know, we're,

35:29.900 --> 35:34.540
we are prevented from perceiving that love as,

35:34.540 --> 35:36.300
it's actually like the most obvious kind of love

35:36.300 --> 35:38.460
and it's right there and it happens all the time,

35:38.460 --> 35:40.140
but we're prevented from perceiving it

35:40.140 --> 35:41.100
because we're not really supposed

35:41.100 --> 35:42.660
to talk about things like that.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.380
It's like, there's something unseemly about it.

35:45.380 --> 35:49.060
Well, it's also in the West, it's an individualist society.

35:49.060 --> 35:53.900
So like, there's a pressure to sort of see the individual

35:53.900 --> 35:58.900
as a distinct sovereign entity that experiences things.

35:59.140 --> 36:01.860
And it's not, the unity between people is not,

36:01.860 --> 36:03.820
it's not obviously sort of communicated

36:03.820 --> 36:06.580
or talked about as part of the culture.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.060
Yeah, it's not part of the culture.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.460
And yet, you know, you see it in our behaviors

36:10.460 --> 36:12.380
because we're humans.

36:12.380 --> 36:15.500
So, you know, why do people listen to sad music?

36:15.500 --> 36:19.100
I mean, one reason is they're hearing expressed for them.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.460
Like the musician is basically saying to them,

36:21.460 --> 36:24.740
this thing that you have experienced,

36:24.740 --> 36:27.740
I've experienced it too, so have lots of other people.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.740
And, but they're saying it all without words

36:29.740 --> 36:32.980
and it's transformed into something beautiful.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.340
And there's something about that

36:34.340 --> 36:37.460
that's just incredibly elevating.

36:37.500 --> 36:40.940
And people don't know it, but there's one study

36:40.940 --> 36:44.460
that I have in Bittersweet that found that

36:44.460 --> 36:47.260
people whose favorite songs are their happy songs,

36:47.260 --> 36:50.140
play it on their playlist about 175 times.

36:50.140 --> 36:53.340
The people who love sad music play them about 800 times.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.540
And they say that they feel connected to the sublime

36:58.540 --> 37:00.880
when they're listening to that music.

37:01.900 --> 37:03.300
What do you think that is?

37:03.300 --> 37:08.180
So what is that, what is it in music that connects us

37:08.180 --> 37:10.660
to the sublime through sadness?

37:11.860 --> 37:13.980
I mean, I have a bunch of different theories.

37:13.980 --> 37:18.980
Like the whole reason I started writing this book

37:19.300 --> 37:22.500
is because I kept having this reaction reliably

37:22.500 --> 37:24.420
to sad music.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.580
And I realized that for people who I knew

37:27.580 --> 37:29.140
who were religious believers,

37:29.140 --> 37:32.060
the way they described their experience of God

37:32.140 --> 37:35.340
was what I was experiencing when I would hear that music.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.700
Like all the time, it happens over and over again.

37:39.700 --> 37:42.300
So you wonder what that is?

37:42.300 --> 37:44.940
Yeah, so I started wondering what that is.

37:44.940 --> 37:48.380
And lots of people have tried to figure out

37:48.380 --> 37:49.500
what that's all about.

37:51.220 --> 37:53.580
And there are different theories that it's expressing,

37:53.580 --> 37:57.500
it's like a kind of catharsis for our difficult emotions

37:57.500 --> 37:58.580
that it's, as we were saying,

37:58.580 --> 38:01.260
a sense of being in it together.

38:02.860 --> 38:06.180
We don't react in that sort of uplifted way

38:06.180 --> 38:10.180
when you just see like a slideshow of sad faces,

38:10.180 --> 38:12.660
which is something researchers have actually tested.

38:12.660 --> 38:14.220
No one really cares when they're seeing the slide

38:14.220 --> 38:15.380
to the sad faces,

38:15.380 --> 38:17.460
but the sad music, they're really reacting.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.940
And also they don't really react

38:18.940 --> 38:19.940
when they're hearing music

38:19.940 --> 38:21.980
expressing other negative emotions,

38:21.980 --> 38:24.020
like martial music or something like that.

38:24.020 --> 38:25.700
It's just the sad music that gives people

38:25.700 --> 38:28.300
this elevated sense of wonder.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.700
So I think it's the combination of the sadness

38:31.700 --> 38:33.300
and the beauty.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.860
And I think it's just tapping into

38:36.900 --> 38:38.780
the essence of the human source code,

38:38.780 --> 38:40.900
which is a kind of spiritual longing,

38:40.900 --> 38:43.340
whether we're atheists or believers,

38:43.340 --> 38:46.660
there's this feeling of longing for a state

38:46.660 --> 38:49.540
and a place of perfect love and perfect unity

38:49.540 --> 38:51.700
and perfect truth and all of it.

38:51.700 --> 38:54.260
And like an acute awareness that we're not there

38:54.260 --> 38:55.080
in this world.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.580
And in religions, we express that

38:57.580 --> 39:01.420
through the longing for Mecca or Eden or Zion.

39:02.700 --> 39:05.340
And artistically, we express it with

39:05.340 --> 39:07.660
Dorothy longing for somewhere over the rainbow

39:07.660 --> 39:12.060
or Harry Potter enters the story at the precise moment

39:12.060 --> 39:13.940
that he's become an orphan.

39:14.780 --> 39:16.820
So he's now gonna spend the rest of his life

39:16.820 --> 39:19.820
longing for these parents who he can never remember.

39:19.820 --> 39:23.420
And there's something about that state

39:23.420 --> 39:24.860
that's at our very core.

39:24.860 --> 39:26.780
And I think that's why we love it so much.

39:26.780 --> 39:27.940
Well, it could be, you know,

39:27.940 --> 39:31.380
you could have the Ernest Becker theory of denial of death,

39:31.380 --> 39:35.140
where at the core of that, the warm at the core,

39:35.140 --> 39:38.020
as Jung said, is the fear of death.

39:38.020 --> 39:42.060
So where the longing for the perfect thing

39:42.060 --> 39:46.020
has to do with sort of becoming immortal,

39:48.020 --> 39:53.020
reaching beyond the absurdity, the cruelty of life,

39:53.740 --> 39:56.140
that all things come to an end

39:56.140 --> 40:01.140
for no particularly good reason whatsoever,

40:01.300 --> 40:03.220
one we can rationally explain.

40:03.220 --> 40:05.940
I know, you know, I wonder about that all the time.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.820
Like, I know, obviously, there's that idea from Becker

40:09.820 --> 40:12.380
and throughout philosophy and the tale of Gilgamesh

40:12.380 --> 40:14.380
about the idea that the thing we're longing for

40:14.380 --> 40:16.980
most of all is immortality.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.300
But I feel like it's not only that.

40:20.340 --> 40:25.340
I think it's more so, or also, let's say,

40:26.220 --> 40:30.820
a longing for the lions to lay down with the lambs finally,

40:30.820 --> 40:33.620
you know, for like the fundamental calculus

40:33.620 --> 40:35.420
of the universe to just be different,

40:35.420 --> 40:38.780
where life doesn't have to eat life in order to survive.

40:38.780 --> 40:42.740
And yeah, just a completely different situation

40:42.740 --> 40:45.660
that immortality would not solve.

40:45.660 --> 40:46.860
I wonder.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.860
That could be a very kind of modern thing,

40:53.340 --> 40:56.020
because surely so much of human history

40:56.020 --> 40:59.220
is defined by violence and glorified violence

40:59.220 --> 41:02.580
that doesn't give inklings of this lions and the lambs.

41:03.620 --> 41:04.460
So much of-

41:04.460 --> 41:05.300
In the Bible.

41:07.020 --> 41:09.140
I mean, I know all the other stuff is in the Bible too.

41:09.140 --> 41:10.460
There's other stuff in the Bible,

41:10.460 --> 41:12.820
and the Bible, that particular aspect

41:12.820 --> 41:14.380
doesn't necessarily reveal

41:14.380 --> 41:17.260
the fundamental motivation of human nature

41:17.260 --> 41:19.780
that could be deeper stuff, you know?

41:19.780 --> 41:23.420
But yeah, that is a beautiful picture,

41:23.420 --> 41:28.420
but is it just about humans, or is it all about all of life,

41:28.460 --> 41:29.820
and you have to think about

41:31.700 --> 41:34.420
what does the perfect world look like?

41:34.420 --> 41:37.380
It's not just the lions and the lambs laying together.

41:39.820 --> 41:41.420
How many lions, how many lambs?

41:41.420 --> 41:42.260
Right, right.

41:42.260 --> 41:47.260
And having just had a few very technical conversations

41:48.220 --> 41:51.140
about Marxian economics versus Keynesian economics

41:51.140 --> 41:53.620
versus neoclassical economics,

41:53.620 --> 41:56.100
what does the economic and the government system look like

41:56.100 --> 41:59.220
for the lions and the lambs that we're longing for?

41:59.220 --> 42:01.420
So then you start to build society

42:01.420 --> 42:02.620
on top of all those things,

42:02.620 --> 42:05.460
but you still, you return to this.

42:05.460 --> 42:08.380
What are we longing for?

42:08.380 --> 42:10.020
And what's the role of love in that?

42:10.020 --> 42:13.580
What's the role of that sad, melancholy feeling,

42:13.580 --> 42:14.860
the feeling of loneliness?

42:14.860 --> 42:17.460
Is the feeling of loneliness fundamental

42:17.460 --> 42:18.660
to the human condition?

42:18.660 --> 42:22.820
Like, are we always striving to sort of channel

42:22.820 --> 42:27.140
that feeling of loneliness to connect with others?

42:27.140 --> 42:28.780
Like, we want that feeling of loneliness,

42:28.780 --> 42:30.660
otherwise we wouldn't be connecting.

42:30.660 --> 42:32.220
Is that fundamental?

42:32.220 --> 42:35.220
That feeling like you're alone in this,

42:35.220 --> 42:36.540
even when you're with other people,

42:36.540 --> 42:37.660
sort of alone together.

42:37.660 --> 42:39.700
You're born alone, you die alone.

42:40.260 --> 42:41.340
Maybe loneliness is fundamental.

42:41.340 --> 42:44.500
I think the longing for union is fundamental.

42:44.500 --> 42:45.860
It's just that it looks so different

42:45.860 --> 42:47.660
for different people, you know?

42:47.660 --> 42:49.100
Right, yeah.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.620
And coming back to what we were talking about

42:51.620 --> 42:53.300
at the beginning, you know,

42:53.300 --> 42:56.300
union looks incredibly social for a lot of people

42:56.300 --> 42:58.420
and hardly social at all for others,

42:58.420 --> 43:01.340
but everybody needs some version of union.

43:01.340 --> 43:02.980
Yeah, people have been telling me recently

43:02.980 --> 43:04.860
about polyamory and all those kinds of things.

43:04.860 --> 43:07.180
So I'm having probably grown up

43:07.180 --> 43:08.260
in a certain part of the world.

43:08.340 --> 43:12.860
I think I'm very monogamy-centric,

43:12.860 --> 43:14.580
not in a judgmental way, just for me.

43:14.580 --> 43:18.380
What makes me happy is one person for my whole life.

43:18.380 --> 43:20.860
Basically, just dedication.

43:20.860 --> 43:23.500
Because I've just seen through relationships

43:23.500 --> 43:26.380
with people and objects in my life,

43:27.660 --> 43:30.020
the longer we stay together,

43:30.020 --> 43:31.660
the deeper the tie.

43:32.660 --> 43:36.220
So that's just the empirical thing.

43:36.220 --> 43:40.180
And yes, that probably is a personalized thing.

43:40.180 --> 43:41.220
That's just true for me.

43:41.220 --> 43:43.100
It could be very different for others.

43:43.100 --> 43:45.660
Maybe it's connected to the introverted thing.

43:45.660 --> 43:46.580
Maybe not.

43:49.020 --> 43:49.860
Who knows?

43:49.860 --> 43:53.380
Before I leave, because you mentioned songs, sad songs.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.900
What are we talking about?

43:54.900 --> 43:59.460
What's a good, what song do you remember last crying to?

43:59.460 --> 44:00.460
Oh, gosh.

44:00.460 --> 44:03.140
Well, I mean, as you know,

44:03.140 --> 44:08.140
so I literally dedicated my book to Leonard Cohen.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.660
He's played such a huge role in my life.

44:10.660 --> 44:11.620
I love him.

44:11.620 --> 44:12.460
I love him.

44:13.980 --> 44:15.780
And I've loved him with this crazy love

44:15.780 --> 44:19.020
that I've never been able to understand for decades.

44:19.020 --> 44:20.780
I think I understand it a little better now.

44:20.780 --> 44:25.100
So you're better friends with him than me, I'm jealous.

44:25.100 --> 44:30.100
So does it make you, is it the musician or the human too?

44:30.340 --> 44:34.380
Because the human is a tortuous soul in a way.

44:34.380 --> 44:36.340
I'd say it's the musician.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.180
It's the musician.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.700
And I actually was thinking about this the other day.

44:38.700 --> 44:41.140
I mean, obviously he's not alive anymore,

44:41.140 --> 44:44.020
but I was kind of running the thought experiment.

44:44.020 --> 44:45.900
If he were alive still

44:45.900 --> 44:48.700
and I had the chance to meet him in person,

44:48.700 --> 44:49.900
would I wanna do that?

44:50.860 --> 44:53.180
And I'm not really sure that I would

44:53.180 --> 44:58.180
because he represents for me symbolically

44:59.140 --> 45:04.140
everything, well, everything in the sentence right there.

45:04.140 --> 45:06.580
And so, and I think that's okay.

45:06.580 --> 45:10.060
I think people can express something through their art

45:10.060 --> 45:12.220
that they might or might not express

45:12.220 --> 45:13.620
if you were just like hanging out with them

45:13.620 --> 45:14.580
and having a coffee.

45:15.620 --> 45:17.540
And I'm happy to know him that way.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.580
He can express himself, I'm sure,

45:19.580 --> 45:23.420
in the way that you know him as over coffee too.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.260
Yeah, maybe you would.

45:24.260 --> 45:29.260
This requires like a focus of remembering,

45:30.460 --> 45:31.940
of like a deep focus of connection.

45:31.940 --> 45:35.540
That's why like when I interact with folks,

45:38.100 --> 45:42.380
it's so draining for me because I'm putting all my,

45:42.380 --> 45:45.980
whatever weapons I got in terms of like deeply

45:45.980 --> 45:48.500
trying to understand the person in front of me

45:48.500 --> 45:50.540
and doing that dance of human interaction,

45:50.540 --> 45:55.540
the humor, the intense kind of delving into who they are,

45:57.380 --> 46:00.940
which requires like navigating around

46:00.940 --> 46:02.540
like small talk type of stuff

46:02.540 --> 46:05.540
and just like compliments and so on.

46:05.540 --> 46:07.860
In general, like people, depending on the culture,

46:07.860 --> 46:08.860
depending on the place,

46:08.860 --> 46:11.260
they'll sometimes flower stuff with smiling

46:11.260 --> 46:13.500
and like compliments like, oh, yeah, I love you.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.060
This is great.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.020
I guess that's all great,

46:16.020 --> 46:18.020
but you wanna get to the core of like,

46:19.020 --> 46:20.580
what are the demons in the closet?

46:20.580 --> 46:22.260
Let's talk about it.

46:22.260 --> 46:24.500
And that could be exhausting.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.660
That can be really exhausting.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.100
So from a Lenin-Cohle perspective,

46:27.100 --> 46:29.300
you get more and more famous.

46:29.300 --> 46:31.060
It can be hard sometimes

46:31.060 --> 46:33.460
because he probably is also an introvert.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.380
Oh, yeah, I know he was an introvert

46:35.380 --> 46:39.220
because he actually tweeted about my book when it came out.

46:39.220 --> 46:41.020
So that was a precious moment for me.

46:41.020 --> 46:43.060
Something that we should all be listening to the quiet.

46:43.060 --> 46:45.820
I can't remember exactly what he said,

46:45.900 --> 46:48.700
but yeah, yeah, no, he definitely was.

46:48.700 --> 46:51.020
He struggled with depression,

46:51.020 --> 46:53.340
which I wonder if that's something

46:53.340 --> 46:55.420
that's also connected to introversion,

46:56.860 --> 46:58.180
but perhaps not actually.

46:58.180 --> 47:00.460
Perhaps that they're very disjoint and also-

47:00.460 --> 47:01.820
It's connected to sensitivity

47:01.820 --> 47:04.100
and many sensitive people are introverts.

47:04.100 --> 47:06.260
So it's kind of like a Venn diagram.

47:06.260 --> 47:09.420
It's about 80% of highly sensitive people are introverted,

47:09.420 --> 47:11.140
but then some are extroverts.

47:11.140 --> 47:13.340
And then not all introverts are sensitive.

47:13.340 --> 47:14.740
So it's complicated,

47:14.740 --> 47:17.220
but he was definitely a sensitive type.

47:17.220 --> 47:18.260
Well, there's on top of that,

47:18.260 --> 47:21.500
you see like the percent of artists

47:21.500 --> 47:23.620
relative to the average that suffer from depression.

47:23.620 --> 47:26.180
So creative people is very high.

47:26.180 --> 47:27.380
Very, very- It's crazy.

47:27.380 --> 47:29.140
Yeah, and then the number of artists

47:29.140 --> 47:31.820
and successful artists who were orphaned

47:31.820 --> 47:32.660
when they were young,

47:32.660 --> 47:34.540
who lost one parent or both parents,

47:34.540 --> 47:36.060
it's like an astronomical number.

47:36.060 --> 47:37.220
I have it in the book.

47:37.220 --> 47:39.420
I don't remember the percentage, but huge.

47:39.420 --> 47:40.340
And he was one of them.

47:40.340 --> 47:43.060
He lost his father when he was nine

47:43.100 --> 47:47.500
and his first act of poetry was he took,

47:47.500 --> 47:49.220
his father made suits.

47:49.220 --> 47:50.100
That's why I thought of him

47:50.100 --> 47:51.980
when we were talking about you in your suit.

47:51.980 --> 47:54.740
And he took one of his father's bow ties

47:54.740 --> 47:57.300
and wrote a poem in his honor

47:57.300 --> 48:01.460
and buried the poem and the bow tie in the backyard.

48:01.460 --> 48:04.260
And that was like his first creative act.

48:04.260 --> 48:07.140
You know that song, Chelsea Hotel Number Two?

48:07.140 --> 48:07.980
Sure.

48:07.980 --> 48:10.140
Where he met, I guess it's about Janis Joplin.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.340
Janis Joplin, yeah.

48:13.060 --> 48:18.060
What a fun, intense, and cruel person she is.

48:18.140 --> 48:18.980
Yeah.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.980
So I guess-

48:21.980 --> 48:23.980
Have you ever seen, I'm sorry to interrupt you,

48:23.980 --> 48:25.580
but have you ever seen his son,

48:25.580 --> 48:29.020
Adam Cohn and Lana Del Rey perform that song together?

48:29.020 --> 48:29.980
Oh wow, no.

48:29.980 --> 48:30.900
It's incredible.

48:30.900 --> 48:31.940
I have to send it to you.

48:31.940 --> 48:32.780
Yeah.

48:32.780 --> 48:34.900
So that for people who don't know,

48:34.900 --> 48:36.620
I mean, maybe I don't know.

48:36.620 --> 48:39.380
It goes, I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel.

48:39.380 --> 48:42.580
You're talking so brave and so sweet.

48:42.660 --> 48:46.180
Giving me head on the unmade bed

48:46.180 --> 48:48.460
while the limousines wait in the street.

48:48.460 --> 48:53.460
There's a good line in there about being ugly.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.580
Oh yeah, we are ugly, but we have the music.

48:56.580 --> 48:59.940
No, before that, from a guy's perspective, it was-

48:59.940 --> 49:03.300
Oh, you told me again, you preferred handsome men,

49:03.300 --> 49:05.220
but for me, you would make an exception.

49:05.220 --> 49:07.180
Yeah, so good, so good.

49:07.180 --> 49:10.020
Well, she continued that thread in later

49:10.020 --> 49:13.660
because I think she said that he was lousy in bed.

49:13.660 --> 49:14.500
Oh, is that right?

49:14.500 --> 49:17.100
Yeah, she publicly said that, which is like,

49:17.100 --> 49:18.580
oh man, did they're-

49:20.580 --> 49:23.060
Just, okay, for people who don't know,

49:23.060 --> 49:26.300
I think this is a true story about them interacting

49:26.300 --> 49:29.620
and being together for a very brief time.

49:29.620 --> 49:31.220
I don't know, dating, but just connecting.

49:31.220 --> 49:35.620
Falling in love in this very particular way

49:35.620 --> 49:39.460
that I think famous musicians, poets can,

49:39.500 --> 49:40.660
which is like, it's impossible

49:40.660 --> 49:42.820
for that kind of thing to last,

49:42.820 --> 49:47.060
but they did it for a brief moment.

49:47.060 --> 49:51.260
There's like a sadness to it because it's so momentarily,

49:52.260 --> 49:53.940
but it's so epic.

49:53.940 --> 49:54.780
Yeah, yeah.

49:54.780 --> 49:55.980
And that these two paths cross

49:55.980 --> 49:58.580
and then you just look at it, we know these famous people

49:58.580 --> 50:01.140
and it's interesting to watch.

50:01.140 --> 50:02.500
Yeah, and you don't even have the impression

50:02.500 --> 50:04.460
that they're thinking it's gonna last.

50:04.460 --> 50:07.620
They more know that it's like a blaze of an intersection

50:07.620 --> 50:09.740
and the limousine's already waiting

50:09.740 --> 50:12.740
while they're in the middle of it and then it's done.

50:14.540 --> 50:18.380
Yeah, and he's talked about how his music,

50:19.260 --> 50:22.380
he said something like, some people are more inclined

50:22.380 --> 50:23.860
to say hello with their music,

50:23.860 --> 50:26.780
but I'm rather more valedictory.

50:26.780 --> 50:27.620
That's what he said.

50:27.620 --> 50:28.460
What does valedictory mean?

50:28.460 --> 50:31.220
Like saying goodbye, like the valedictorian's address.

50:32.340 --> 50:33.180
Interesting.

50:34.180 --> 50:38.140
You know, so many of his songs really are about some form

50:38.140 --> 50:41.980
of parting or goodbye or an imperfection or something

50:41.980 --> 50:43.620
or like the broken hallelujah.

50:45.220 --> 50:46.060
Yeah, that's so.

50:46.060 --> 50:49.140
But the thing that's so incredible about him

50:52.620 --> 50:54.740
is the way that he's taking all of that

50:54.740 --> 50:57.620
and pointing it in the direction of transcendence.

50:57.620 --> 51:02.220
Like it's not just pure sadness, it's sadness and beauty.

51:02.300 --> 51:03.980
And that's the thing.

51:03.980 --> 51:05.740
Yeah, there is a feeling of transcendence

51:05.740 --> 51:07.780
in a lot of the songs.

51:07.780 --> 51:10.660
It's like sadness and transcendence, you're right.

51:10.660 --> 51:15.660
It's a goodbye, but you're moving on to some bigger thing.

51:17.220 --> 51:19.260
But in a sort of ethereal way,

51:19.260 --> 51:23.500
like not like a proud, arrogant way.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.620
Yeah.

51:24.620 --> 51:28.060
So his favorite poet was Garcia Lorca.

51:28.060 --> 51:30.060
He actually named his daughter after him.

51:30.060 --> 51:31.500
His daughter's name is Lorca.

51:31.500 --> 51:36.500
And he talks about how there's some poem

51:37.060 --> 51:40.420
that Lorca had written that made him realize

51:40.420 --> 51:44.180
that the universe itself was aching,

51:44.180 --> 51:45.540
but the ache was okay,

51:45.540 --> 51:48.340
because that's the way you embrace the sun and the moon.

51:49.860 --> 51:51.420
And that's what I think is,

51:52.940 --> 51:55.900
that's why I think there's this whole rich vein

51:55.900 --> 52:00.380
in this bittersweet tradition that he embodies.

52:00.420 --> 52:02.340
That's like the essence of beauty.

52:02.340 --> 52:05.260
It's the way you embrace the sun and the moon.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.540
The song, Hallelu, I return to that often.

52:08.700 --> 52:10.140
I've been meaning to play it.

52:11.860 --> 52:14.300
I have now a friend who wants to sing it with me.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.180
Are you a singer?

52:20.900 --> 52:22.540
When somebody says they're a singer,

52:22.540 --> 52:23.700
do they have to be good?

52:25.100 --> 52:26.420
Because then no.

52:26.420 --> 52:27.540
But I would say yes.

52:27.540 --> 52:28.900
I was in a band for a while.

52:28.900 --> 52:29.740
I sang for a while.

52:29.740 --> 52:33.940
I was always bad, but I enjoy it.

52:33.940 --> 52:34.780
I enjoy it.

52:34.780 --> 52:35.660
I enjoy lyrics.

52:35.660 --> 52:37.180
I enjoy words.

52:37.180 --> 52:40.620
When sung or spoken, they capture something.

52:40.620 --> 52:41.940
Like again, that moment.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.380
Tom Waits is a huge favorite of mine for that reason.

52:46.660 --> 52:51.660
Although he often, his lyrics are often not that simple.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.940
I'd rather have a bottle in front of me

52:54.940 --> 52:56.380
than a frontal lobotomy.

52:56.380 --> 53:01.380
He's always playing with just like these weird word play.

53:03.020 --> 53:06.260
Especially in the English language, it's trickier to do.

53:06.260 --> 53:08.060
I'm fortunate enough to know another language,

53:08.060 --> 53:10.700
which is Russian, so I get to understand

53:10.700 --> 53:14.780
that certain languages allow for more word play than others.

53:15.780 --> 53:18.780
English, for that reason, I don't think has a culture of,

53:22.900 --> 53:23.740
you know what?

53:23.740 --> 53:25.300
I mean, to push back on what I'm about to say,

53:25.340 --> 53:30.220
but there was no culture of word play

53:30.220 --> 53:33.020
until hip hop came along.

53:33.020 --> 53:37.100
So like distorting words in interesting ways

53:37.100 --> 53:39.500
for there to be a rhythm, a rhyme,

53:40.700 --> 53:41.780
and at the same time,

53:41.780 --> 53:46.780
you're capturing some really powerful message plus humor.

53:46.780 --> 53:47.660
All of that mixed in.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.700
Actually, hip hop does a really good job of this,

53:49.700 --> 53:50.980
but there wasn't a tradition,

53:50.980 --> 53:53.140
if you look at poetry in the 20th century,

53:53.140 --> 53:54.580
there wasn't really a tradition of that

53:54.620 --> 53:55.700
in the United States,

53:55.700 --> 53:58.060
but there was in other parts of the world,

53:58.060 --> 53:59.620
and certainly in Russia.

53:59.620 --> 54:00.460
Interesting.

54:00.460 --> 54:02.340
Empowered also, not just by the language,

54:02.340 --> 54:03.980
by the fact that you go through a world war

54:03.980 --> 54:05.860
where tens of millions of people die.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.740
Something about mass death of civilians

54:09.740 --> 54:12.860
that inspires great literature and music and art.

54:12.860 --> 54:14.020
Yeah, absolutely,

54:14.020 --> 54:16.100
because you start telling the real truth, I think.

54:16.100 --> 54:19.620
Yes, there's no more reason for small talk.

54:21.660 --> 54:22.500
That's funny.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.660
I always have thought that if I could choose

54:25.660 --> 54:28.580
any other medium besides writing, it would be singing.

54:29.940 --> 54:31.060
But then- Are you a singer?

54:31.060 --> 54:32.580
No, I mean, I'm really not.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.500
I just love the idea of it.

54:34.500 --> 54:37.260
But then I also think I'm fundamentally a shy person,

54:37.260 --> 54:39.980
so I think it's much better that my medium is writing

54:39.980 --> 54:40.820
instead of singing.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.580
So it all worked out.

54:42.580 --> 54:46.580
That said, you're also an exceptionally good public speaker,

54:46.580 --> 54:51.420
and you're not supposed to be mathematically speaking.

54:51.460 --> 54:52.620
Mathematically speaking-

54:52.620 --> 54:54.620
You're not supposed to be a good public speaker.

54:54.620 --> 54:56.380
Oh, you mean because of shyness or-

54:56.380 --> 54:58.340
Yeah, because of shyness, because of introversion,

54:58.340 --> 54:59.740
because of all those kinds of things.

54:59.740 --> 55:02.580
Oh, yeah, but lots of introverts are public speakers,

55:02.580 --> 55:04.100
actually.

55:04.100 --> 55:05.660
I knew this from the studies,

55:05.660 --> 55:08.900
but then also when I started going out on the lecture circuit,

55:08.900 --> 55:10.620
I realized that all my fellow speakers

55:10.620 --> 55:12.540
at all these conferences I was going to,

55:12.540 --> 55:13.820
they're all introverts,

55:13.820 --> 55:17.180
because they're all people who spent years

55:17.180 --> 55:18.460
figuring out some idea,

55:18.460 --> 55:19.860
and now they're out there talking about it.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.180
Oh, they're in their head figuring out the idea?

55:22.180 --> 55:23.020
Yeah, yeah.

55:23.020 --> 55:26.740
So how do you explain that the public speakers,

55:26.740 --> 55:28.260
would you say the good public speakers

55:28.260 --> 55:29.900
are usually introverts?

55:29.900 --> 55:32.140
No, I think there's just different styles of it,

55:32.140 --> 55:33.660
and I think that we just have,

55:34.540 --> 55:36.260
when we hear the word public speaker,

55:36.260 --> 55:40.300
we have a really limited idea of who that person would be.

55:41.380 --> 55:44.940
So for me, I used to be very phobic about public speaking,

55:44.940 --> 55:47.940
and part of the reason for it was because I thought

55:47.940 --> 55:50.100
that being the kind of person I was

55:51.220 --> 55:54.180
didn't equal being able to be a good public speaker,

55:54.180 --> 55:56.060
because you're only imagining

55:56.060 --> 55:58.900
like the super kind of out there showman.

56:00.300 --> 56:02.300
But I think there's another style of public speaking

56:02.300 --> 56:05.700
that's more reflective, and thoughtful,

56:05.700 --> 56:08.420
and conveying ideas, and people like that too.

56:08.420 --> 56:10.860
Is there advice you can give on how to overcome that?

56:10.860 --> 56:13.700
Like if you're a shy person,

56:13.700 --> 56:15.340
how to be a public speaker?

56:15.340 --> 56:17.060
I can totally give that advice,

56:17.060 --> 56:20.580
because I used to, before I would give speeches,

56:20.580 --> 56:22.220
if I had to do it in law school,

56:22.220 --> 56:24.060
if I knew like today was the day

56:24.060 --> 56:26.580
when I was gonna get called on in a law school class,

56:26.580 --> 56:29.140
I literally one time vomited on my way to class,

56:29.140 --> 56:30.940
like that's how nervous I used to be.

56:32.580 --> 56:37.020
And yeah, the way to do it is through desensitization,

56:37.020 --> 56:38.300
it's like been figured out,

56:38.300 --> 56:39.860
it's the way to overcome any fear,

56:39.860 --> 56:43.060
you have to expose yourself to the thing you fear,

56:43.060 --> 56:45.180
but in very small doses.

56:45.180 --> 56:47.980
So you can't start by giving the TED talk,

56:47.980 --> 56:48.980
you have to start.

56:48.980 --> 56:50.780
I started by going to this class

56:50.780 --> 56:52.940
for people with public speaking anxiety,

56:52.940 --> 56:55.740
where on the first day, all we had to do

56:55.740 --> 56:59.060
was stand up and say our name, and sit down,

56:59.060 --> 57:00.980
and like that's the victory.

57:00.980 --> 57:03.700
That's fun to watch, all those people with anxiety.

57:05.540 --> 57:06.780
Okay, that's the first step,

57:06.780 --> 57:08.740
and then step, one step at a time.

57:08.740 --> 57:10.340
Yeah, and then like with this class,

57:10.340 --> 57:11.500
you go back the next week,

57:11.500 --> 57:15.300
and he would have us come to the front of the room,

57:15.300 --> 57:18.820
and stand up with other people standing next to us,

57:18.820 --> 57:20.780
so that you didn't have the feeling

57:20.780 --> 57:22.460
of being all alone in the spotlight,

57:22.460 --> 57:24.340
through others sharing it with you.

57:24.340 --> 57:25.700
And you would answer some questions

57:25.700 --> 57:29.060
about where do you grow up, where do you go to school?

57:29.060 --> 57:31.540
And you declare victory and you're done.

57:31.540 --> 57:33.380
And then little by little by little,

57:33.380 --> 57:35.540
you keep ratcheting up the exercises,

57:35.540 --> 57:37.900
until you get to the point where you can do it.

57:37.900 --> 57:39.340
And then you start having successes,

57:39.340 --> 57:42.260
and you realize, oh, actually I can do this.

57:43.580 --> 57:46.580
What about writing versus improvising?

57:46.580 --> 57:48.740
Because I knew a few people,

57:48.740 --> 57:50.940
the colleagues of mine that were working on TED Talks,

57:50.940 --> 57:55.820
and it feels like you're supposed to write the thing

57:55.820 --> 57:57.820
way ahead of time, and you practice it,

57:57.820 --> 58:00.340
and they help you, and all that kind of stuff.

58:00.340 --> 58:02.540
I don't think I've ever practiced the speech

58:02.540 --> 58:05.260
once in my life, or a lecture, or any of that.

58:05.260 --> 58:06.620
I know it's really good to do,

58:06.620 --> 58:10.900
but do you find that relieves some of your anxiety

58:10.900 --> 58:13.700
preparing well, or are you now able to do

58:13.700 --> 58:15.900
not preparing well at all?

58:15.900 --> 58:19.900
I definitely like to prepare before,

58:19.900 --> 58:23.300
but the kind of preparation that I've done for my TED Talks

58:23.300 --> 58:25.340
is completely different from what I've done

58:25.340 --> 58:26.260
for everything else.

58:26.260 --> 58:29.460
Because TED Talks are more like a theatrical event,

58:29.460 --> 58:31.500
where it's like a one person show.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.100
And of course, if you were gonna go on Broadway

58:34.100 --> 58:36.700
with a monologue, you would know every word.

58:36.700 --> 58:37.940
So it's kind of like that.

58:37.940 --> 58:40.420
And so I would rehearse it over and over

58:40.420 --> 58:41.700
the way you would do that.

58:41.700 --> 58:44.980
Isn't that more anxiety, knowing every single word?

58:44.980 --> 58:47.340
It's so much anxiety, because yeah,

58:47.340 --> 58:49.420
you're not even so freaked out about being on stage

58:49.420 --> 58:51.620
so much as, what if I forget something?

58:51.620 --> 58:52.820
Yeah, absolutely.

58:54.260 --> 58:57.060
I mean, they do things like, the last TED Talk I gave,

58:57.060 --> 58:59.300
I actually did forget something halfway through.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.300
I just couldn't remember the next line.

59:02.260 --> 59:05.620
And so I had to walk over, like over there were my notes.

59:05.620 --> 59:10.620
And so I did that, and the audience very kindly clapped

59:10.620 --> 59:13.340
while I did that, and then I came back to the spotlight

59:13.340 --> 59:15.100
and kept going, and they edit that out.

59:15.100 --> 59:17.300
Nice, so there's a failure mode, it's okay.

59:17.300 --> 59:21.980
But still, it seems really stressful.

59:21.980 --> 59:24.900
Like I'm now, I'm not sure if I'll ever publish it,

59:24.900 --> 59:29.900
but I've been, mostly it's for personal journey,

59:30.660 --> 59:35.660
but I've been working on a series on, wait for it,

59:35.660 --> 59:38.620
Hitler and the Third Reich, sort of looking at

59:38.620 --> 59:40.500
the historical context of everything,

59:40.500 --> 59:43.140
because my family was so much affected by

59:43.140 --> 59:46.700
that whole part of history, so for me to rigorously,

59:46.700 --> 59:49.300
I've read a lot about Stalin and Hitler,

59:49.300 --> 59:52.060
and for me to force myself, one of the best ways

59:52.060 --> 59:55.060
to force yourself to really consider material

59:55.060 --> 59:56.860
is to have to talk about it.

59:56.860 --> 59:57.700
Totally, yeah.

59:57.700 --> 59:59.380
And so that's why I'm doing it,

59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.100
but I'm playing with ideas of some of it,

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.460
maybe like 20% is written down on paper,

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.260
but the rest of it is my thoughts in the moment.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:15.140
That's a difficult balance to strike,

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.580
because if you write a lot, you're going to be more precise,

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.260
you're going to be more accurate,

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.980
but you're going to miss some of the deep,

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:25.380
like honest emotion.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:29.020
The silences won't be correct.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:33.540
The silences between the words won't capture

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.300
the depth of feeling, unless if you're somebody like me,

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.700
if you're like, I guess that's what actors

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.180
and actresses have to do.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.580
Basically, even though the script is fully written,

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.900
you improvise between the words, between the lines.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.740
Yeah.

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.820
But that's a skill.

01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.660
Well, it also takes so much time.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.140
I mean, I experienced that with the TED Talks.

01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.500
It's like, you get to a stage,

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.900
so you're memorizing everything word for word,

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.540
and at first, in that process,

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:07.020
it comes out in a really wooden way, the way you're saying,

01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.580
like the emotion's gone.

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.020
But once you really know it,

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:11.740
so you've internalized the words,

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.780
then all the emotion comes back,

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.020
and you can say them in a completely different way,

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.740
and you're really speaking it from the heart.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:21.340
But you have to know it so well before you can do that.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.380
So I would never recommend it,

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.500
because it's just like, it's so time consuming.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:28.420
Well, in your case, it works out beautifully.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:32.940
When it all comes together, it is a theatrical thing.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.060
It's like a musical or whatever.

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.140
I think I'm gonna come out with a one-man show on Broadway,

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:43.540
singing, now I'm inspired.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.740
No, but for real, where are you gonna talk

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.180
about Hitler and Stalin and everything you're learning?

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.060
Me too.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:52.540
Have you ever thought of using the medium

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.820
of just speaking into a microphone, but without the video?

01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.740
I'm curious about this,

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:02.980
because I fell in love with podcasts originally,

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.900
before there was ever this whole video component to it.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.300
And I realized there's something so primal and magical

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.420
about having someone's voice in your ear.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:14.620
And my favorite kinds of interviews still,

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.620
very few people do it this way nowadays,

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:19.820
but my favorite kind are when you're just talking

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.020
into the microphone.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.780
So it's not over Zoom, it's not in person,

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.620
it's just you in the microphone

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.940
and the other person in the microphone

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:28.340
and they're in your ear.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:30.820
It's like the ultimate in intimacy.

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.540
Oh, you mean from the interviewer perspective,

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.580
that's your favorite.

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.740
Yeah, but it would be interesting also

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.220
with the kind of thing you're talking about

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:40.660
of just speaking, like just you in the mic.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.420
I would love to be in person, but you can't see the person.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.180
I wonder what that's like.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.300
What do you mean, like they're all there,

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.140
but behind a curtain?

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.820
No, you just have your eyes closed.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.500
You just talk and you have your eyes closed,

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.940
or whatever you have,

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.660
because I think you still have to get

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.620
the same kind of chemistry,

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.740
because it's not just the visuals.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.140
I don't even know that,

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.180
because obviously I have trouble making eye contact,

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:03.100
but I don't know if the visual stimulation

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.700
is the necessary thing.

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:07.420
There's something about the way audio travels

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:08.940
that captures the intimacy.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.660
Where some people actually have headphones on,

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.340
like Joe does this, have headphones on,

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.980
that's really intimate.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.700
Like there's something about that sound

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.540
going directly into your ear.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.500
Yeah, there is something primal there.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.420
Yeah, for sure.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.380
I've thought about it, definitely.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:28.020
Some of my favorite podcasts are like that.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:31.420
WTF with Marc Maron, that's audio only.

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.740
There's a few audio only podcasts that I just love.

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.580
What is that?

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.660
I still go on Clubhouse,

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:42.020
that was a social media platform where it's audio only.

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.260
It's so interesting that people,

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.300
the interesting thing about Clubhouse in particular

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:48.500
is people from all walks of life can tune in

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:50.740
and they just have,

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.500
it's something you need to do some research

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.020
in terms of introversion on that one,

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.220
because I don't feel any of my introvert

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.060
like triggers happening.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:06.220
Because nobody can see you, it's just audio,

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:11.220
and nobody is offended if you're just sitting there quietly,

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.700
just listening.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.140
So you can participate whenever you want or not.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.140
Yeah, it's like the ultimate social freedom.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.820
You can listen as much as you'd like,

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.140
you can participate if you want,

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.780
but you don't have to, it's no big deal.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.060
Yeah, because nobody can like,

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.980
if I'm actually at a physical party,

01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:28.140
somebody's gonna look at me and be like,

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.740
why, there'll be that pressure to speak,

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:34.380
but you don't have to in that kind of audio setting.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:36.100
And there's that intimacy.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.260
Like you can, when it's audio only,

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.620
it feels like you can reveal a lot more of yourself

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.700
in some kind of honest way.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:44.740
I don't know what that is.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.580
What is that?

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.340
I don't know, but I assume it's tapping in

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.940
to something really ancient.

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.900
Like we used to tell stories around the fire,

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:56.620
like our whole storytelling tradition was oral originally.

01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.460
So maybe it's that, but we used visual stuff.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.940
That's true, you could actually see the person

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:03.820
on the inside of the campfire.

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.260
Seems like the visual element's so fundamental

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:10.980
to social interaction, but there is something primal

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.660
about audio, I wonder what that is.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.140
And still, that's why, I mean,

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:17.380
most people listen to podcasts, I think, audio only.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.500
They have it in their ears while they're doing stuff.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.020
Yeah, that's how I do it.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.700
And then there's, yeah, that's how I do it too.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:27.580
And that's where the friendship is formed, it's weird.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.940
The deep connection with other humans is formed

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.340
because they're in your ear.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:38.020
And you get to see them grow, you get to see them be bored,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:40.940
experience excitement and anger and fear

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.420
and all those kinds of things.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.140
It's fascinating, it's fascinating.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.900
The world of podcasting is fascinating

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:50.380
because we're in this world of essentially radio,

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:55.060
even though we have all this high definition content,

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:59.020
all this TikTok style fast stuff and still podcasting.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.260
I know, and we still choose to do this.

01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:02.100
It's weird.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:02.920
Because at the end of the day,

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.540
I think that's really what people want most,

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.260
is just to talk to each other

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.740
and to know what people really think.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:10.780
And podcasting of all the media that I've ever seen

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.540
is the one where people come closest

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.740
to telling you the truth.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.500
And to telling you the good and the bad

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.980
and the bitter and the sweet and all of it.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.900
Especially long form, there's not enough time.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.020
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.820
I had to explain this to people,

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.380
like you talk to CEOs and stuff,

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.980
they don't understand,

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.980
they're starting to understand much better.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.980
Now as a hard requirement with CEOs and stuff,

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.780
it has to be three hours, I say.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.180
Wow.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:42.620
There's something,

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:46.460
they can't be doing marketing stuff for three hours.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:47.660
They break.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.420
They start being human, they start joking,

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.420
they start relaxing.

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:53.220
And if they can't, that also tells a kind of story.

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:56.100
But I do that kind of torture for CEOs only.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:56.940
Anyway.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.980
Yeah, when I was getting,

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.340
my publishing house did media training with me

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.940
before Bitter Sweet came out.

01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:07.700
And they were preparing me for the five

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.500
to seven minute interview that you might have,

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.340
if you go on some quick TV thing or something like that.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.580
And God, I hate that.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.660
It's like, it feels like they're,

01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.260
you're basically having to not tell the full truth somehow

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:24.660
because you can't tell it in such a short amount of time.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:25.500
Well, the other.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.180
So to me, podcasting is just the best thing

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.340
that's ever happened.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:32.060
The other downside of the seven minute interview

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.140
is I think you could do a really good job with that,

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.820
but the dance partner has to be very good.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.860
It's actually challenging for everybody involved.

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.860
It's much harder for everybody involved.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.500
Because if you can do,

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.300
I can imagine like a Christopher Hitchens type character

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.060
who's just super witty.

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:52.900
Then that you could do a seven minute thing.

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.340
You can get to the core of Bitter Sweet.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.100
You can get to the core of the book

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.260
without asking those generic small talk questions.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.740
Because too many people in that short form interview

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.820
are just asking very generic questions.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.900
They're doing small talk for seven minutes.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.460
That's like, all right.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.020
Like you only get seven minutes.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.540
You only get one interesting question.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.540
Go ask the weirdest, the deepest question

01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.740
that also energizes the other person.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:25.060
It's an art form that people don't take seriously.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:29.180
I think the seven minute thing, five minute or even less.

01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.020
And then the commercials, which I.

01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:36.820
Yeah, and I've noticed that many of the best podcasters

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.900
are ones where when you're on my side of the table,

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.020
you feel like it's more of a conversation

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.660
and less like an interview

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.180
where you're answering all the same questions

01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.740
you've answered a million times before.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:50.980
It's really interesting how different the experience is.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:52.860
And you're right, the audio thing.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.780
If you can lose yourself in that, the intimacy of that,

01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.580
and you don't even remember what stupid stuff you said.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.180
People, I've seen that, I mean,

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.180
people don't give them enough credit as,

01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.900
you might not be aware or might not be a fan,

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:13.700
but Joe Rogan is a incredible conversationalist in that

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:18.420
he makes you forget that anything's being recorded,

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.580
that you're talking at all.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.860
He makes you forget time and you just enjoy yourself.

01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.060
And that's, whatever that is.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:30.900
And that plugs, then you plug into that primal connection

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:31.820
to other humans.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.180
What's your favorite Leonard Cohen song?

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.500
Famous Blue Raincoat.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.220
Do you know that one?

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.060
Maybe I'll play it.

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.380
Yeah.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.620
For people who don't know Leonard Cohen,

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.780
and this is your first introduction to him,

01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:49.540
it's gonna sound so gloomy, but it's so good.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.000
He's got this deep, rich voice.

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:55.500
Tori Amos covering Famous Blue Raincoat.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.700
No, we want the original.

01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:02.220
Just like Hallelujah, Jeff Buckley covered Leonard Cohen.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.180
That was a really good one.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:04.780
That was a really good one, yeah.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.020
And I also really like Rufus Wainwright's cover.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.140
But Famous Blue Raincoat, for people who don't know it,

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.900
it's basically about a love triangle,

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.140
and it's told from the perspective of a man

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.700
whose wife has just been with another guy

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.420
who is also his friend,

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.220
and he's writing a letter to that other guy,

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.780
and he's reflecting on the way

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:31.140
that all their relationships have changed

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:33.860
in the wake of this event.

01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.140
So they're still friends.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.220
So they're still, well, he refers to him

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.260
as my brother, my killer,

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.060
which is such a Leonard Cohen thing to do,

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:44.100
because it's always like, you know,

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.020
it's light and it's dark all at once.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.180
Nothing is ever all one thing.

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.180
Yeah, I love this song.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.020
Yeah, right?

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:00.860
I mean...

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:12.420
He just speaks it.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:15.500
It's four in the morning,

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.260
the end of December.

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:20.620
I'm writing it out to you.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.180
And the fact that it's four in the morning

01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:23.300
and it's the end of December,

01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.140
it's like, I'm writing it out to you.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:26.260
It's the end of December.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:28.140
Like, those are transitional moments.

01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.700
You know, it's night going into day,

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.900
and it's December going into the new year.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.300
It's not an accident.

01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:42.020
There is something about December, whatever.

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.700
There's certain scenes you can paint in your mind.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.460
There's a poem by Charles Bukowski called Nirvana.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.460
It's a young man traveling

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.620
through the middle of nowhere in the snow.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.100
There's something about the snow,

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.140
either the rain or the snow

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.260
can put you in a certain kind of mood that just,

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.620
what is it, James Joyce, the dead,

01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:06.260
the snow is falling on Dublin.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.260
Yeah, it can put you in a place.

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.220
I mean, David Yaden,

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.180
he's a researcher in psychedelics and consciousness

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.620
at Johns Hopkins.

01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.700
He's a great guy.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.140
And he's done research that has found that

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:23.100
when people are in their transitional moments of life,

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.740
and it could be a career change, it could be a divorce,

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:28.980
it could be that they're nearing the end of their life,

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.300
that they very often will say

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.260
those are their most meaningful moments

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.180
and their most spiritual moments.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.500
And so I feel like that's what Leonard Cohen

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.740
knows how to tap into instinctively.

01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:41.060
The year after he died,

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:44.780
his son, Adam Cohen, made a memorial concert for him

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.500
where all these famous musicians came to Montreal,

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:51.220
where they had lived, and performed his music.

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.260
And my husband, who's not a Leonard Cohen fan,

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.940
and he's not a bittersweet type at all,

01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.580
but he knows how I feel about him,

01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:00.220
he's like, you should really go to that concert.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.180
And I felt so ridiculous.

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:05.500
The whole family went all the way to Montreal on a Monday.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.340
On a Monday.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.580
On a Monday, it was just like a random Monday.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.740
And we got on the plane, so everyone's out of school

01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:15.860
just so I can go to this concert.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:20.860
And I got there, and at the beginning,

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:24.540
I was feeling like, this was all a terrible mistake

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.340
because it's all these other musicians playing this music

01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.460
and I don't actually really want to hear them.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.860
I'd rather listen to him on YouTube.

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.860
And then a musician named Damien Rice came

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.780
and played famous Blue Raincoat, and he sang it.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.420
And he did the most amazing thing at the end.

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:46.640
The whole thing was amazing.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.060
But then at the end, he sang this musical riff

01:13:49.060 --> 01:13:52.380
that was like, all I could say is that

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:55.740
it was like a musical lamentation of the ages.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:59.980
And the whole audience just rose silently to its feet.

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:04.660
And it was one of the greatest moments that I've ever had.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:08.100
There's sometimes certain artists in a cover can capture

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.260
in some kind of deeper way,

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:13.860
like carrying the thread of the power of the song.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:17.580
So I've been listening a lot to Johnny Cash Heart,

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:20.540
which is a Nine Inch Nails, Trent Reznor song.

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:23.060
You talked about it on your podcast with Rick Rubin,

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.380
which is when I reached out to you,

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:27.900
because I love that interview and I love that song also.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.980
Yeah, so there's the Kennedy Center Honors

01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:34.020
where they celebrate a certain artist,

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:35.300
they did that for Led Zeppelin,

01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.120
and I forgot what her name is,

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.740
but the lead singer of Heart performs There Were to Heaven.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:45.340
And it's like, if you're like, all right,

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.420
you take one of the great sort of rock songs of all time,

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:51.780
what do you do in front of, oh, the cool thing is

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.940
you get to perform this in front of the artists

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:56.220
while they're still there, they're still alive.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.900
So you get to watch you sort of perform,

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:01.400
and in that case, the president, President Obama's there,

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.580
and she just knocked it out of the park.

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.580
But at the same time, without outdoing the original, somehow.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.340
Right, you're just making it your own.

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.340
You're making it your own?

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.940
Right, it's not overlapping it.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:17.780
But not departing completely,

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.340
not departing from the spirit of the original.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.940
It's tough, because the original Hollywood by Leonard Cohen,

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:28.340
it's just not, it's so powerful,

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.060
but it's just not as good as some of these covers.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.180
Well, I think it's the words and the melody,

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.740
and then the covers take it to a different place.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.420
The thing that Leonard Cohen seems to do well,

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.060
I don't think he did it on Hallelujah,

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.020
because he was almost being playful on Hallelujah.

01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:52.660
Like, I don't know, as opposed to that deep melancholy,

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:57.460
like painful longing thing that Jeff Buckley did,

01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.380
and others do too.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.260
I wonder if it's because, in a way,

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.780
he, I don't mean that he over-edited it,

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.020
but he apparently worked on that song for years,

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:08.160
and went through gazillions of verses,

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.060
and checked most of them out.

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:12.500
I wonder if we're hearing his version

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.860
after he's a little tired with that process.

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.660
Yeah, well, that's the other thing,

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.760
is maybe from a book tour, you know.

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.580
It's like, you get tired of saying the same thing

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.460
over and over and over and over, you forget the...

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.340
You forget the initial, the heart of it.

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:34.180
Yeah, but I actually got a chance to hang out

01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:38.580
with Dan Reynolds, who's the lead singer of Imagine Dragons.

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:43.380
This is an incredible band, super pop.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:45.820
The most played band on, like, Spotify or something.

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:46.660
Is that right?

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:49.220
It just went through a huge Imagine Dragons phase,

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.220
so we were listening to their music a lot.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:53.300
It was so surreal to be hanging out with him,

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.140
and he's such a good...

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.500
Like, very few people I've met in my life

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.980
are just as good of a human being.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.620
And that has to do with the fact that he struggles.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:03.940
He still, I think, struggles,

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.900
but he struggled for a long time with depression.

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.780
And so, out of that pain, you see,

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.200
born this really good human being,

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:16.220
this really good relationship with his wife,

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:20.980
like, when times are good, they lean on each other for,

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:24.500
like, they're deeply grateful for those precious moments.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.060
So, it's beautiful to watch.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:31.060
But he said that it's really important

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.620
to feel the song every time.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:36.300
Otherwise, people know.

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:39.060
People are really good at detecting your bullshit.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.660
You can't fake it.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.400
You really have to feel it every time.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.220
You have to feel the emotion of it,

01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.700
whatever the emotion is.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:47.820
Of the original time, you wrote it.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.980
Yeah, so it's just interesting,

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:53.860
because it put, I thought you could maybe fake it,

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.060
but he believes personally,

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:59.220
because he played in front of gigantic crowds,

01:17:59.220 --> 01:18:01.060
and over and over and over and over and over.

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.780
He's like, no, every time, you have to be there.

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:06.420
There's gotta be times when he's about to go out,

01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:07.620
and he's not feeling it,

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:09.220
and he has to figure out some way

01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:11.340
of getting himself into that heart space.

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.180
Well, that's what he's saying.

01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.820
You have to, otherwise you're just, that's the job.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:17.100
Don't take the job, then.

01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.780
And he loves it.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.300
He says the biggest struggle, in fact,

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:25.020
is the come down from that,

01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:28.980
which is like, you have such a beautiful experience

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.100
of connecting with this large number of people,

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.220
sharing a song that you love,

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:37.500
and then it's such a rush of connection,

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.860
and then you have to, when you get off stage,

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:43.860
you're now back to normal life,

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.540
and that's why a lot of musicians get into heavy drugs

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:47.380
and all that kind of stuff,

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.180
because you're looking for that rush again.

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.140
It's very tough to then go into this,

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.740
speaking of introvert, because he probably is an introvert,

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:59.460
is like, you have to find that calmness,

01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:00.860
and how do you find the calmness

01:19:01.620 --> 01:19:03.700
when you were just playing in front of tens of thousands

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.340
of people, or hundreds of thousands,

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.380
whatever that number is, that rush of connecting,

01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:10.580
and everybody, there's love in the air,

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.300
and you still have to find that inner peace and calm.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.620
That's interesting, because I,

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.540
so I don't know if this is the introvert in me talking,

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:21.580
and the writer in me talking, but I don't know.

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:24.180
Like, I love most the moments where,

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.780
let's say I'll get a letter from a reader

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.940
who will tell me what something I wrote meant to them,

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:32.300
and they'll talk about having had that kind of moment

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.860
of the communion between the writer and the reader,

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.300
and obviously I wasn't there physically when it happened,

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.100
so I wasn't getting that kind of rush

01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:41.020
that a musician would get in a concert,

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:44.300
but just the knowledge of that having happened

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:45.660
out there in the world,

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.620
due to something that I added to it,

01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.820
is the most amazing thing.

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:50.660
You love it.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.300
But see, imagine reading like thousands of those letters,

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.660
and then it's such a strong rush,

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:58.060
and everything else doesn't.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.420
It could be overwhelming, I guess,

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.660
but like anything else, you have to come down

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.340
and find a calm place.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:10.100
Like for example, the danger with getting letters like that,

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.580
you start taking yourself too seriously.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:15.220
You think like you are a special person somehow,

01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:19.660
but that's, you really wanna avoid that feeling too.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:23.060
Yeah, I don't actually experience it as that much different

01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.420
from when I'm on the other side of it.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.220
Like if I'm the reader,

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:29.100
and some other writer has made me feel that way,

01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.060
to me it's the same thing.

01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:30.900
Yeah, me too.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.780
Yeah, it's a cool, it's a virtual hug.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:36.860
I think it's like, I was just listening to something

01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:41.140
about the different Russian writers.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.820
I was mentioning him to you, this academic,

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.300
his name is Gary Salmorson,

01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.780
and he studies Russian literature,

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.780
and he was talking about,

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.940
I don't know if I'll be able to get this right,

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:54.580
but basically that the people misunderstand

01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:56.220
a work like Anna Karenina,

01:20:56.220 --> 01:20:59.700
and that we think of it as telling us

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:03.100
that you're supposed to live,

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:08.100
you're supposed to have these grand tempestuous romances

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:12.860
that might end in death or despair or whatever it is,

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:16.020
but you should be in it for the intensity of the emotion.

01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:19.460
And he's saying actually that's exactly not

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:22.460
what Tolstoy was saying,

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:24.420
that actually it was the opposite,

01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:25.660
that he was really making,

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:28.100
he was really advocating for everyday life.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:29.460
He was saying it seems from everyday,

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.500
like he was juxtaposing Anna Karenina

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.620
with all these other couples

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:36.340
who were just living happily and quietly day by day,

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:40.540
and that was what he believed was the ideal.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:43.940
So, as opposed to the grand rush,

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.220
and as opposed to the intensity.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.980
I wonder if he, is there a depth to the,

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.900
is there a romance at day to day?

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:53.740
So he's just-

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.980
I think there is a romance to the day to day, absolutely.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.420
Don't get distracted by the dopamine roller coaster ride

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.380
of the grand romantic notions.

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.180
Yeah, and enjoy it while it's happening,

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:05.300
because those are life experiences also,

01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.620
but not to mistake those for being everything.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:09.900
Where is he from?

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.740
He's a professor at Northwestern.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:12.580
At Northwestern.

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.180
And apparently his lectures

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:16.180
are like the most popular on campus.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:18.460
Wow, people love him.

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:20.820
Gary Saul Morrison is an American literary critic

01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:22.020
and slobbist.

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:24.140
He's particularly known for his scholarly work

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:26.740
on the great Russian novel lists,

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.340
Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.060
Morrison is Lawrence D. Professor

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:33.180
in the Arts and Humanities at Northwestern University.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.380
Yeah, wow, and there's a lot of incredible work.

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.500
And then I'm sure looking through the lens

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:40.500
of Russian literature and the romance of all of that,

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.380
he's looking at the modern world.

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.820
Yeah, I think you should have him on your podcast.

01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.420
And quiet flows the vodka,

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:49.460
or when Pushkin comes to shove

01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:51.940
the Karmunjian's Guide to Russian Literature and Culture.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:54.820
This is one of the silly books he has on the list.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:55.660
Okay, cool.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.500
What were you saying?

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.340
I'm sorry.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.300
Oh no, I was just saying, yeah,

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:03.300
I find that when I take photos on my phone,

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.580
I hardly ever take photos at the moment you're supposed to.

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.980
Everybody's gathered for some event.

01:23:08.980 --> 01:23:10.340
I'll forget to take the photo.

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:12.740
But I take a lot of scenes from everyday life,

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.780
because that's what I actually wanna remember in the end.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.420
Yeah, yeah, I'm the same, the same.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:22.340
It's actually concerning,

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:25.020
because it's bad for productivity.

01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.540
Because I love everyday life so much,

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:30.700
then why do any ambitious big thing?

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.220
Your productivity is pretty good.

01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:34.620
I don't know that you have to worry about it.

01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.460
I do.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.780
So I wanna launch a business.

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.340
I have a dream outside.

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:41.060
This is like a fun side thing

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:45.860
that there's been a lifelong passion.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.740
Anyway, I like building.

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:48.660
I like building stuff.

01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:51.300
And I haven't been doing that as much as I would like.

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.460
That's because, largely,

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.420
because I like sitting in silence

01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.980
and enjoying the beauty that is just nature and life.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.380
And when there's people, there's people.

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:03.260
I love people.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.100
I love everything.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.820
And so when you love everything,

01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:08.300
why go through hell to build a company?

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.380
Yeah, that's a valid question.

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.380
I mean, I think you have to have a really good reason

01:24:13.380 --> 01:24:14.700
for wanting to do it.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:17.020
But then your heart calls you for the certain,

01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:19.140
sometimes you look out into the mountains

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:22.140
and you say, for some reason, I long to go there,

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:23.860
even if it means leaving the tribe

01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:27.340
and putting yourself in danger and doing stupid shit.

01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:31.140
That's the human imperative for exploration.

01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:32.460
Yeah, absolutely.

01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:36.220
Like when we were talking about this idea of longing being

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.740
like the source code of humanity,

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:42.260
I think that's also the source code of our creativity.

01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:44.580
It's the same longing for Eden.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:47.900
It's like you're always reaching for something

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:50.100
that you wanna get to or that you wanna build.

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:50.940
Yeah.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:51.780
It's the best of us.

01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.180
What do you think?

01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.260
You've read about creativity and sadness.

01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.860
Practically speaking,

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:05.700
how should we leverage sadness for creativity?

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:09.140
Is that sort of in the artist's domain,

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.300
in the writer's domain, in the engineering domains

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:13.260
and so on?

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.740
It's definitely in those domains, but it's in all domains.

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:20.820
We're all gonna face pain in this life at some point

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.820
and we all have the ability to weather it and withstand it

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.300
and live with it for a bit

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.980
and then try to transform it

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:33.220
into something that we find beautiful.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:39.060
And it's very easy to notice the grandeur

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.340
of the painting hanging on the gallery wall

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.820
or the new company that's just been created,

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:49.500
but it takes a thousand different forms.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.980
You could bake a cake or like in the wake of the pandemic,

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.180
we've had more people applying

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:57.380
to medical school and nursing school.

01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:00.180
And after 9-11, you had people applying for jobs

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.940
as firefighters and teachers.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.620
There's something in the human spirit that takes pain

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.980
and turns it into meaning when we're at our best.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.140
And when we're not at our best, we deny the pain

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:15.740
and then take it out on ourselves and on other people.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:19.340
So there's a kind of fork in the road of what to do with it.

01:26:19.340 --> 01:26:21.260
But we know, there's all these studies

01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.460
that I go through in the book.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.460
There was one where the researchers had people

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:31.820
watch different movies, happy movies, sad movies,

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.380
bittersweet movies.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.740
And they found when people watched Father of the Bride,

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:38.340
which is like the ultimate bittersweet,

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:42.140
you're walking your daughter down the aisle kind of feeling,

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.980
that was, they would give them creativity tasks

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:47.380
after watching these different movies.

01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:49.820
And the people who had been primed for bittersweetness

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:51.540
were the most creative.

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.300
And they were like primed to remember finality,

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.860
like love and finality, basically, love and impermanence.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.180
There's something about that

01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:04.260
that gets us to our most beautiful state.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.220
I wonder if it is, I mean, there's studies like that.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.900
There's, I don't know if you've looked

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.900
into terror management theory.

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.620
Yeah, that's really interesting stuff.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:15.340
So they especially intensely have you focused

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:19.900
on not just sad, but traumatic like death,

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.300
prime you with death and see how that changes your mind.

01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:27.820
Like both, like, I don't know if there's creativity studies,

01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:32.900
but they have interesting, I think a little bit tainted

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.300
by political bias, but maybe not.

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.740
I mean, psychology is a complicated field,

01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:41.780
but they study like who are you likely to vote for

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:44.220
if you're primed by existential,

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.620
like by thinking about death.

01:27:45.620 --> 01:27:46.740
Like the fear of mortality.

01:27:46.740 --> 01:27:49.340
Fear of mortality, I forget what the conclusions are, but.

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:53.140
I think they find that people become more tribalistic.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.540
Like there was one study where they found

01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:56.700
that after they primed people that way,

01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:01.460
that they would then give them the chance

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.140
to put hot sauce on a meal

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.180
that their political opponents were gonna be eating

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.260
and they put way too much hot sauce on

01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.100
after they've been primed to worry about death.

01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:16.020
I think at the core were simple creatures.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.740
So I actually, like in the book, I spent a bunch of time

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:23.540
with people who are working on radical life extension,

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:26.260
you know, or the quest to live forever.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.460
And people ask them a lot questions like,

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:29.300
you know, the kinds of questions

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:30.540
you were talking about earlier.

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.220
Well, like, how are you gonna feed everybody

01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:34.540
and how is there gonna be space for everybody

01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:36.980
if everyone really could live forever?

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:38.660
And what about conflict

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:41.060
when we have an intensified conflict?

01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.820
And their answer to that is

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.380
they point to terror management theory, you know,

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:50.260
and they say, because it's the fear of death,

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.620
they're basically saying it's the fear of death

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:53.500
that are causing our conflicts in the first place.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.740
And that if we remove the fear of death,

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:58.740
we'd have less conflict to contend with.

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.260
And that, I don't really buy that.

01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:04.860
It's possible that that's true, but are you also,

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.820
how does the expression go?

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:08.580
Throwing out the baby with the bath water?

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.900
Are you also going to remove basically

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:15.900
any source of meaning and happiness in the human condition?

01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.660
Like it's very possible that death is fundamental

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:22.940
to the human condition, the finality.

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:26.100
Yeah, that's the great philosophical question.

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.180
And I went to a conference of people

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.460
who are working on this and I thought

01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:33.260
that they were gonna be talking about those questions

01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:34.340
all through the conference.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.820
But the MO is much more like,

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.700
we're so happy that we're here with people

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.620
who have gotten past all those quibbles.

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:43.460
Yeah.

01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:44.300
You know, and we just know

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:45.420
there's gonna be meaning no matter what.

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:50.420
The basic assumption is let's try to extend life indefinitely

01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:54.140
and then we'll figure out if that's a good decision.

01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:55.780
Or more like we're sure it's a good decision.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.820
We're sure, it's a mix.

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:00.740
That was what I felt, or what was expressed, let's say.

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:04.860
Sure, it's either we're sure it's a good decision

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.860
or we're sure that it's good to believe

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.460
that it's a good decision.

01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:12.960
Meaning like there's no downside to that,

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.500
even if we find out it's wrong.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.060
But yes, there's a kind of certainty.

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:18.540
Obviously you want to extend human life,

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.980
that's the kind of assumption.

01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:24.980
That always seemed, now it could be true,

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:30.380
but just like the people who over-focus

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:33.820
on colonizing other planets,

01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.980
it feels like you neglect the beauty

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.340
and the struggle of our life here on Earth.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.060
I have sort of the same kind of criticism,

01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:45.180
whether it's thinking about Valhalla

01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:47.500
or any other afterlife,

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:50.560
is you can have, if you're not careful,

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:56.020
forget to make this life a great one,

01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:58.340
whatever happens afterwards.

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.340
Yeah, definitely, but from an engineering,

01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:02.140
from a biology, from a chemistry perspective,

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:04.180
it's very interesting to think,

01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:05.620
how do we extend this thing?

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:07.580
Because it does seem that nature,

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:10.860
the way it designed living organisms,

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.620
it really wants us to die.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.220
Because that's part of the selection mechanism,

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.420
this part seems to be fundamental to evolution.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.940
It gets people young, they need protection.

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:27.100
Once they're young brain, they get to explore a lot,

01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.060
get to figure out the world,

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.940
they come up with their own novel ideas,

01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.180
how to adapt and how to respond to that world.

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:36.260
And then as they get older and older,

01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.060
they get like stubborn and stuck in their ways.

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.660
And so we need them to die,

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.860
so we make room for new life

01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:47.220
that's able to adapt to the changing environment.

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.540
If the old doesn't die,

01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:52.100
then you're going to get stale

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:56.060
and not be adaptable to the changing environment.

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:58.420
But maybe it doesn't have to happen so soon.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:00.180
Yeah, maybe it doesn't.

01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:02.620
Listen, I'm a big fan of pressing snooze

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:06.860
on the alarm clock in the same way.

01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.340
I'm one of the people that believe it's,

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.500
or I don't definitely believe, of course,

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:18.100
I don't know, but I think death

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:22.300
is a fundamental part of life.

01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:24.900
But yeah, if I'm on my deathbed,

01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:26.460
I would sure as hell press snooze

01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:27.660
as many times as possible.

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.100
Yeah, I know.

01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:29.940
And it's interesting,

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:31.700
because in some ways I really,

01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:34.660
I share your instinct.

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:37.060
There was one scientist who I spoke to at that conference,

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:38.940
he's one of the leading advocates.

01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:40.420
And he said, you know,

01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:43.980
that's a story that we've invented for ourselves

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.700
because we have no choice.

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:48.260
And if you really believe that you have no choice,

01:32:48.260 --> 01:32:51.380
then it's adaptive to tell that story

01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:52.940
that death gives meaning to life.

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:53.780
Good point.

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.300
But if you really think you don't,

01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:57.660
if you really think you could triumph over it,

01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:59.740
would you still be telling that same story?

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.500
And I've been thinking about that question ever since.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:06.100
Yeah, yeah, no, they got a good point.

01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:06.940
They got a good point.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:07.780
No matter what,

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:10.060
as an engineering and the scientific pursuits,

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.140
it's a beautiful one.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:13.820
In your own personal life,

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:15.500
if we can go there.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:16.420
Sure.

01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.060
What's been some dark places you've gone in your own mind?

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:21.460
Grief, loss,

01:33:23.820 --> 01:33:25.540
sad moments,

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.140
moments of sadness

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:30.380
that have made you a better writer,

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:32.500
a better creator,

01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:34.380
a better human being.

01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.460
Well, I mean,

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.980
I've been through a lot of bereavement

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:40.500
just in these last couple of years with COVID,

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:44.860
but even before that,

01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:46.540
I mean, there's all kinds of stuff.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:48.020
I write about it in the book,

01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:48.860
and in some ways,

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.260
I feel like I can write about those kinds of things

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.100
better than I can speak them.

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.460
But I had a really complicated relationship

01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.580
with my mother growing up,

01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:02.580
where we had a kind of Garden of Eden during my childhood.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.940
Like we were intensely, intensely close.

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.900
And my mother,

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:13.900
because of some vulnerabilities that she had reacted

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:20.940
with a lot of trouble to my adolescence

01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.260
and to growing independent from her

01:34:24.260 --> 01:34:26.780
and starting to have different religious views

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:29.740
and different political views and all kinds of things.

01:34:29.740 --> 01:34:34.740
And we had a pretty intense break

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:37.980
that I described in the book.

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:42.300
And it was so intense that even though after that,

01:34:42.300 --> 01:34:45.580
we still would get together for holidays

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:48.260
and talk to each other on the phone and all that,

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.700
there was a sense in which like it was over at that point,

01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.420
the relationship was over.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.460
The Garden of Eden was no more.

01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:58.460
Yeah, yeah, it was like a feeling of like,

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:01.060
yeah, like I know what Eden was like,

01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.100
and it's not there anymore.

01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.940
And I think it was all the more confusing

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:10.460
because like if you lose someone to actual bereavement,

01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:12.900
you go through a mourning process

01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:14.580
and people have thought for thousands of years

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:15.860
about how to do that.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.060
But with something like this,

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.220
there's no process because you're not even admitting

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.340
to yourself, especially when you're like in your teens

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:25.220
and twenties, that you're mourning something.

01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:30.220
So, but it was the case that for decades,

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:34.700
for decades, I could not answer even the simplest question

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:36.780
about my mother, like where did she grow up

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:40.940
without tears in my eyes or more than tears in my eyes,

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.740
like embarrassing tears.

01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:45.980
So I would just try to steer the subject in another place.

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:51.220
But I will say, two things happened.

01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:54.300
One is that I've spent the last six, seven years

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.180
writing this book about joy and sorrow

01:35:57.180 --> 01:35:59.380
and loss and love and all of it.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:02.700
And I've really come to terms with all of it.

01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.380
And then the second thing that happened is

01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.660
my mother now has Alzheimer's.

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:12.660
And in her Alzheimer's, she's still actually the same person.

01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:15.820
Like she's forgotten most things,

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.580
but she still has these conversational lanes

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.660
that you can travel down that are like the way

01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.180
she always was.

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:25.060
And the way that she was when I was a kid,

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:28.900
which was like so incredibly loving and so connected

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:32.860
and so warm and sweet and funny and all of it,

01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:36.180
all the things I remembered, like it's all come back.

01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:41.180
And for all these decades, I had been wondering

01:36:42.620 --> 01:36:44.940
whether that Garden of Eden I remembered

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.700
had actually happened or whether that was just like

01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:51.660
the fantasy of a child and maybe it was always difficult

01:36:51.660 --> 01:36:53.460
and I had not seen it.

01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:58.100
But I'm seeing her now and I realized that it was all true,

01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.580
everything I remember, it was all true.

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.780
It all happened because it's happening again.

01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:09.260
And you returned to the Garden of Eden for a time.

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:10.100
Yeah.

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.100
And to childhood.

01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:13.780
Is that always a question of whether you can return

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:15.220
to that place?

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:16.060
Well, I don't know.

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:17.460
I don't even know if I'd say I've returned

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:21.620
because I'm a different person now and I don't need her.

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.700
Are you sure?

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:23.540
Are you sure?

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.380
Yeah.

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:29.380
And then the 10-year-old, you feel different?

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:33.020
No, I mean, I'm the same person in terms of my need

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.140
for love and love of love and all of that,

01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:40.140
but I don't look, I'm not dependent on my mother for it

01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:42.980
the way I was then and that makes the experience

01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:43.940
really different.

01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:48.940
Yeah, when you're younger, she's a God figure.

01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:52.060
What is that, that the roots, the parents,

01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:54.700
such a funny civilization will live

01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.700
and there's a depth of connection to parents

01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:00.580
that's probably more powerful than anything else

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:03.220
in terms of its formative effect on who you are.

01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.860
I think it's the most powerful.

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:08.460
And in fact, when this started happening,

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.300
I got to college and I took a class in creative writing

01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:13.900
and I tried to write a story, a fictional story,

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:16.100
a fictionalized version of what was happening.

01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:19.020
And I called it the most passionate love

01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:21.420
because of what you just said.

01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.140
And the teacher actually said to me,

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:25.660
she was like, you should put this story in a drawer

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.780
and not take it out again for 30 years

01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:29.460
because you're way too close to it.

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.700
Yeah.

01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:33.420
So I've now finally written it 30 years later.

01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.100
Yeah, you're probably still too close to it though.

01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:44.620
I don't know though, I mean, I do think like,

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:47.820
I think everybody goes through experiences in this life

01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.420
where you're experiencing like a fundamental pain

01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.820
of separation and desire for reunion.

01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:56.540
And it takes so many different forms.

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:58.540
And this was my primal form of it,

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:02.740
but for someone else, it's a betrayal or a bereavement

01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:05.180
or an exile from a country of their birth

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.140
or whatever it is.

01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:09.380
And then you get to solve that puzzle

01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:12.340
for the rest of your life.

01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:15.380
Yeah, the fact of like, I really do believe

01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:19.740
that the original love that we long for,

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.340
like that one of the great things that you learn

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:25.020
as you grow older is that the love exists

01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:27.460
in some plane that's more general

01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.340
than the particularized form in which you first knew it.

01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:31.620
Yeah, I mean, that's why,

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.140
despite all the creepy interpretations was why,

01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:39.420
even though Sigmund Freud is probably wrong in the details,

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:41.300
he was the first one to sort of suggest

01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:45.580
that our experiences, I mean, he said that,

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.540
that that was really controversial at the time

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:50.140
when young people, they start having sexual thoughts

01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:51.780
like at like age two or something,

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:53.140
whatever the hell he said.

01:39:54.180 --> 01:39:57.780
So you develop this kind of connection to the opposite sex

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:00.380
or whatever it is, to your mother, to your parents.

01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:04.220
And I think while a lot of that is shown

01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.460
to be probably not true,

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.900
what is like a deeper truth there

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.260
is your first early experiences of love

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:14.620
or depth of connection are probably somehow

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:18.140
strongly formative of your conception of love

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:21.420
and your definition of the perfect thing

01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.620
you're reaching for, for the rest of your life.

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.180
Yeah, I think that's right.

01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:28.540
And you can really see it when you become a parent too.

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.980
You can just see like there's-

01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:32.740
Don't screw it up.

01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:36.020
You know, I have to say, I mean, knock on wood,

01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:38.540
I actually feel like we're doing pretty well.

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.780
My kids are teenagers now and I really had thought

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:44.740
that I wasn't gonna repeat the issues

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.820
that I had been through with my mom.

01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:48.100
And I can say, I really am not.

01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.020
Yeah, like my mom for various reasons

01:40:53.020 --> 01:40:55.940
just had a lot of trouble with my independence

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.100
and I just don't feel that at all.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.180
So-

01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:04.180
Yeah, there might be other things you're totally blind to.

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.380
I guess that's possible.

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:07.180
Isn't that the way of parenting?

01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:08.940
You solve the problems of the past,

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:09.780
but there's always gonna be new problems.

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.060
But there's some other new one.

01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:13.140
I guess I'll find out in 10 or 20 years,

01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.900
but like so far so good.

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:18.340
What wisdom about parenting can you give

01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:20.780
from your own experience and from your writing?

01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:24.300
Yeah, well, oh my God, there's a lot to say.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:27.500
So on the bittersweet side of things,

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:29.580
the wisdom that I would give is

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:35.820
that especially for kids who are growing up

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:39.260
in relative comfort with everything going pretty well,

01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:45.580
they get the idea that real life

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.500
is when things are going well.

01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.100
And when things don't go well,

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:51.540
it's like a detour from the main road

01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.100
as opposed to understanding that it's all the main road.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:59.620
And I tell this story in the book of this time

01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:02.020
that we went on this family vacation

01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:04.260
where we rented a house in the countryside

01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:07.260
and the house was next to this field

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.980
where lived two donkeys that our kids fell in love with.

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:14.020
And they were like really little at the time, two boys.

01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.300
And they're spending all this time

01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:19.020
feeding carrots to the donkeys and it's all beautiful.

01:42:19.020 --> 01:42:20.860
And then comes the day where they realized

01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:22.340
that we're leaving in like two days

01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.980
and they're never gonna see these donkeys again.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.340
And they start crying themselves to sleep.

01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:30.380
And the usual things that parents might say

01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:32.420
at a moment like that of like,

01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:35.780
maybe we'll come back or another family will feed them.

01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.100
We'll feed these donkeys.

01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:39.580
None of that made any difference.

01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:44.260
But when we said to them, goodbye is part of life

01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:49.260
and this feeling you're having, everybody has it.

01:42:49.700 --> 01:42:52.060
You've had it before, you're gonna have it again.

01:42:52.060 --> 01:42:53.940
You'll feel better in a couple of days.

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:58.180
But this is the way it's supposed to be, this is natural.

01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.620
That's when they stopped crying

01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:03.820
because I think that's when they stopped resisting.

01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:04.660
Yeah.

01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:07.140
Like it's one thing to feel the pain of goodbye

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.980
and it's another thing to be feeling like

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.580
this isn't supposed to be happening.

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.980
It's the resistance part of,

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:14.620
this isn't supposed to be happening

01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:16.660
that makes life really difficult.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:17.500
Yeah.

01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:19.620
As opposed to a more clear-eyed view of what it really is.

01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.540
This is indeed supposed to be happening.

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.020
There's a show called Yellowstone

01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:25.020
that I recently started watching.

01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.180
Yeah, no, I've heard of it.

01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:27.740
We actually started watching it,

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:29.900
but only a few minutes and didn't get into it.

01:43:29.900 --> 01:43:31.060
So there's just a quick,

01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.580
it's not a spoiler of any kind,

01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.460
but there's a father taking out the son

01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:36.700
for the first time to go hunting

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:39.860
and to shoot their first buck.

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:43.300
And the son is getting really sad

01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:46.140
because he pulls the trigger and he took a life.

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:51.140
And the father says that everybody gets killed in this life.

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.980
That's the way of nature.

01:43:52.980 --> 01:43:57.100
That's the way each one of us is going to get killed.

01:43:57.100 --> 01:44:00.580
And it's interesting because I didn't really

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:03.620
think of it that way because you think you die,

01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.260
but he really framed it as killed.

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:08.380
Because he's like,

01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:12.300
there's no such thing as dying of old age.

01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:14.420
Medically, let's discuss that a bit,

01:44:14.420 --> 01:44:16.460
but basically there's something,

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:21.460
whether it's a truck or a bacteria,

01:44:22.540 --> 01:44:26.500
something's going to kill you in the end.

01:44:26.500 --> 01:44:28.820
And that was an interesting way to look at it

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.540
because we tend to think of humans

01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:34.060
aren't supposed to be killed.

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:35.780
We think of murder as one of the sins,

01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.580
one of the things that you don't do in society.

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.500
But you know what, we do.

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.060
That's a more technical discussion,

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.620
whether we ultimately get killed by something in the end.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:49.420
But to some degree, that's true, at least for most of us,

01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.660
that there's something that gets us,

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:53.660
whether it's cancer, those kinds of things.

01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.860
It's interesting.

01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:58.340
But yeah, that reframing of it's supposed to be,

01:44:58.340 --> 01:44:59.700
this is the way of the world.

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.340
Yeah, though it's funny.

01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.900
I mean, at the same time that I just wrote a whole book

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.300
about the fact that this is the way it is,

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.140
I really do believe this is the way it is.

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.740
And with this reality, there's an intense beauty

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:13.620
that comes along with it.

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:16.180
So we have to accept the reality to get to the beauty.

01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:17.060
I believe that.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.220
And at the same time, there's a part of me that's just like,

01:45:21.220 --> 01:45:22.660
yeah, but give me the magic wand

01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:24.420
to make the world different.

01:45:24.420 --> 01:45:25.260
Yeah.

01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:27.220
Yeah.

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:30.140
I don't know how much of this is a female thing too.

01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:33.460
I was watching with my son, my 12-year-old the other day,

01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:36.740
we were watching this show about the Battle of Thermopylae.

01:45:36.740 --> 01:45:41.740
And it was all about valor and glory on the battlefield.

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.820
And I said to him something like,

01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:49.020
gosh, don't you just wish we lived in a world

01:45:49.020 --> 01:45:52.460
where you didn't have to do all this

01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:55.540
in order for everyone just to live their lives?

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.900
And he just looked at me completely puzzled.

01:45:57.900 --> 01:46:02.380
Like, no, to him it all just seemed self-evident

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.900
that the world would be structured that way.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:08.020
And he had the 12-year-old's admiration

01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:09.740
for the valor of it all.

01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:14.740
But you wonder if that's nature or nurture.

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:19.140
I wonder what that world looks like.

01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:23.540
We do live in a world where murder is seen as bad,

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.220
but you look at a lot of the human history.

01:46:27.220 --> 01:46:30.900
I don't know if they had the same kind of conception of that

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:35.220
in terms of, you have to ask what kind of murder?

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:38.380
For what purpose?

01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:40.020
War was a way of life.

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.500
It's interesting.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:47.020
It's interesting if we can imagine properly

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:51.380
a future that is different than ours

01:46:51.380 --> 01:46:53.780
in terms of operating under different moral systems.

01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:58.260
I'd like the same with living indefinitely

01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.620
or living in a society with no war.

01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:04.220
Like, how fundamental is war?

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.180
How fundamental is death to humanity?

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:08.620
I mean, I think it's so fundamental to our source code.

01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:11.300
I just wish that our source code were different, basically.

01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:13.980
Like, I can't get past that wish.

01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:17.540
There's brain-computer interfaces that try to merge.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.260
So, greater and greater, we have smartphones,

01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:23.140
we're already kind of cyborgs,

01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.900
but greater and greater merger of computational power.

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:30.620
So, literally adding source code to our original source code

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.540
is just a different, there's the mushy biology

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:37.220
that runs source code, and then there's more cold

01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:41.420
electrical systems, and then they integrate together,

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:45.140
and potentially, one day we offload

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:49.380
the magic that is human consciousness

01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:51.460
also into the machine, and then we'll get to see.

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:54.340
Maybe they'll be a little bit less ass-holish

01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:56.100
about the whole war thing.

01:47:56.100 --> 01:48:00.100
That'd be more, but there is, I think,

01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:04.380
when I think about engineering human intelligence

01:48:04.380 --> 01:48:05.900
or superhuman intelligence systems,

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:10.060
I feel like they also need to have the yin and yang of life.

01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:13.740
They have to be able to be afraid and to be sad

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.460
and all those kinds of things,

01:48:15.460 --> 01:48:18.740
but maybe it's because I'm a product

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.900
in this particular environment.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.620
Maybe sadness is a useful human invention,

01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:26.540
but not a universal one.

01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:27.660
This is what I don't know,

01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:29.980
because this is where I come back to the,

01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:33.380
as I told you, the original reason that I wrote my whole book

01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:37.940
was the feeling that somehow in the expression of sad music

01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:41.660
is what other people see when they talk about God.

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:45.540
There's something so, there's an ultimate beauty there

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.180
that I don't know if we have access to without that,

01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.020
but maybe we do.

01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:52.300
But I can say in this world,

01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:55.500
it's a great way to get access to that state.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.900
Is it within the reach of science

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.540
to deeply understand this, you think?

01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:01.220
To understand that why you feel sad

01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:02.700
when you're listening to a song?

01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:04.220
Or why you feel so much love

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:05.660
when you're listening to a sad song.

01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:07.460
To a sad song, right.

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:12.460
Why the sad song opens up some kind of deep connection

01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:16.100
to something you can call divine or something,

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.420
whatever the heck that is.

01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:19.100
Yeah, I do think.

01:49:19.100 --> 01:49:22.220
I mean, we have like really early signs of it

01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:23.100
from the research,

01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:27.060
and I'm sure we're just scratching the surface stage.

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.860
But I mean, like we know, for example,

01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.900
that the vagus nerve, which is so fundamental

01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:36.020
that it governs our breathing and our digestion,

01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.420
our vagus nerve also activates

01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:41.260
when we see another being in distress.

01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:44.980
There's like an instinctive impulse to wanna make it stop.

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:49.380
And the theory is that that's an evolutionary design

01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:51.660
because we had to be able to respond

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.140
to the cries of our infants, you know,

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:57.060
and from that ability grows the greater ability

01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.740
to respond to other people's cries too.

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:02.820
So that's probably just, you know,

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.820
like the very first step

01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.540
in being able to understand what all that is.

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:11.900
We've already given plenty of advice, but broadly,

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:15.700
what advice would you give to young folks today

01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.620
about career, about life,

01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:21.220
whether they wanna be writers, lawyers,

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:23.700
scientists, musicians, and artists,

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:25.380
whatever the heck they wanna be,

01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:27.980
how can they live a life they can be proud of?

01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.460
Okay, here's what I think.

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:36.620
You should absolutely do that thing

01:50:36.620 --> 01:50:38.500
that you're dying to do,

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:42.500
but you should always have a plan B,

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.460
like a backup plan and a way of earning a living

01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.020
no matter what happens.

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:49.980
Because I feel like people,

01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:53.980
we have this narrative in our culture

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:57.940
of like that the glamorous thing is to figure out

01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:02.260
the thing you love and then risk everything to achieve that.

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:04.540
But first of all, a lot of people aren't comfortable

01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:05.780
with that level of risk.

01:51:05.780 --> 01:51:09.300
And second, when you're living with that level of risk,

01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:10.940
that's a cognitive load too.

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:14.300
And so you don't have the full emotion and heart

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.660
to be able to focus on the thing

01:51:15.660 --> 01:51:16.700
that you actually really love

01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.860
because you're like stressed out about it.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:21.100
So I'd say like get the backup plan in place

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.540
and then do the thing.

01:51:23.860 --> 01:51:25.620
My advice would be the opposite.

01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:26.460
Huh, okay, tell me why.

01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.820
I'm moving the romantic.

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:32.820
Well, I think the best, the truth is be aware of the cost

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.580
not having a plan B has,

01:51:37.580 --> 01:51:39.780
so do it deliberately if you don't.

01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:43.140
But I'm with Bukowski on find what you love

01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:44.740
and let it kill you.

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:48.180
I think, you have to actually know your personality.

01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.940
I know if I have a plan B,

01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:53.860
I will not try as hard on plan A

01:51:53.860 --> 01:51:56.820
and I would likely take plan B

01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.060
because if plan A is the risky thing,

01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:03.100
I just work way much better when

01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.900
in the state of desperation.

01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.900
So with my back against the wall

01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.220
and you have to know that about yourself.

01:52:08.220 --> 01:52:09.060
I think that has to do.

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:10.180
So I think we can refine it

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:12.460
to say you actually have to really know yourself

01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:15.020
and how you respond to different kinds of risks.

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.660
Like I would not do well in that kind of situation.

01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:20.780
I'd be like up at two in the morning worrying about it.

01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:22.940
Whereas if I have some,

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:25.060
like it doesn't have to be paying the rent in some grand way,

01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:28.420
but if there's some basic way of paying the rent,

01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:31.340
then my heart's free to do the thing I really love.

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.900
That's hilarious.

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:35.580
For me, the only way I'm free is

01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:39.420
when I don't know how I'm gonna pay the rent.

01:52:39.420 --> 01:52:40.500
Huh.

01:52:40.500 --> 01:52:45.500
Yeah, because otherwise I'll find a way to pay the rent.

01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.940
That's not at all a source of deep fulfillment for me.

01:52:50.100 --> 01:52:50.940
I see.

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:52.820
So it's like if you don't have like the,

01:52:52.820 --> 01:52:53.820
what's the expression?

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:55.620
I don't know, something like the dog at your back.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.460
Yeah, deadlines.

01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:57.740
Then you won't actually do it.

01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.340
I create real or artificial deadlines,

01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.540
anxiety and so on.

01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:04.500
So yeah, you have to know yourself.

01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:07.300
Yeah, so really the advice is know your triggers.

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:10.620
But we're still saying the same basic thing of like,

01:53:10.620 --> 01:53:12.420
do the thing you really love,

01:53:12.420 --> 01:53:13.900
but just set up the

01:53:13.940 --> 01:53:16.620
strategize the rest appropriately to your personality.

01:53:16.620 --> 01:53:18.860
Exactly, exactly.

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.940
What do you think is the meaning of life?

01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:23.380
The meaning of this whole thing

01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:26.420
probably has something to do with

01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:31.260
whatever we feel when we listen to a sad song.

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.100
Yeah.

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:36.380
Because two things come simultaneously to my mind

01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.700
when you ask that question,

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.940
and I've been asking it since I was four.

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:41.500
I remember the first time I did.

01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:44.820
The question is more important than the answer probably.

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:45.660
Yeah.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:46.700
Just keep asking.

01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.540
I don't know.

01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:48.380
The first one is beauty,

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:50.420
and I don't know why beauty is so important,

01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:51.780
but I just know that it is.

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:54.340
And impossible to define perhaps.

01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:55.620
Is it definable?

01:53:57.620 --> 01:53:59.820
Other than you know it when you see it.

01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.220
I don't know, I mean, just.

01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:05.020
Has to do with that line.

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:08.180
You feel something when you just see it or you hear it.

01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:10.420
Yeah, you just see it and it's like,

01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.860
like some, it's,

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:15.900
whatever can deliver you to that mode of transcendence

01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:18.860
where you're no longer purely in your own self

01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:22.580
and you're in something higher.

01:54:22.580 --> 01:54:25.340
And when you're in those states of mind,

01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:30.460
you know it because you have the temporary sensation

01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.380
that you could die at that moment,

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.660
that the people you love could die,

01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.900
and it will all be okay because there's something else.

01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:40.380
So that's my first answer.

01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:44.700
And then my second answer is the need to relieve

01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:47.700
psychic pain, like other people's psychic pain.

01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:49.180
I don't know why, that's just,

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:50.780
that's just like an impulse that I have.

01:54:50.780 --> 01:54:54.620
Psychic pain is more like suffering of any form.

01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:55.460
What is it?

01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.300
Yeah, but I mean.

01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.860
What, is there a particular?

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:03.860
Yeah, just making the world better and less pain,

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.340
less pain to go around in general.

01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:11.100
Hence your sort of optimistic desire and longing

01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:14.660
for a world without sort of destruction,

01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:18.380
without malevolent destruction.

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:21.140
Yeah, a world where that wouldn't be necessary.

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.460
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:25.740
But yeah, like I, so I had this moment,

01:55:26.980 --> 01:55:29.140
it wasn't so long ago, I was doing some interview

01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:30.460
and somebody asked me like,

01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:32.820
what are you longing for right now?

01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:36.180
And my answer at that moment was like,

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:38.380
you know what, I'm actually at this moment in life

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:40.380
where I'm not longing for anything.

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:41.780
I'm at this particular way station

01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:44.940
where everything is the way I want it to be.

01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:49.580
And of course, the minute you say something like that,

01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:51.020
you know, you're gonna be proven wrong.

01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:55.540
Because like an hour later, I get a letter from a reader

01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.260
who I've been in touch with over the years.

01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:01.300
And he was telling me about like a psychic struggle

01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:02.140
that he's going through.

01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.260
And I just felt like, oh my gosh,

01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:06.340
if there were anything I could do to make it

01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:08.380
that his life wouldn't have been such

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.580
that he would be in this position in the first place.

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:13.940
Like his struggles had to do with a long life history.

01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:19.540
So I don't know why I feel that so intensely, but I do.

01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:22.260
Those moments when you're just at peace,

01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:23.900
there's nothing else you want.

01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.180
I feel like that's like a temporary repose,

01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:27.420
like a pause.

01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:28.260
Exactly.

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:33.460
You bet your ass a desire follows that at some point,

01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.420
but you get to enjoy those little moments.

01:56:35.420 --> 01:56:38.620
Yeah, and even when he asked me and I answered that way,

01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.940
I said, this is a way station.

01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:41.540
Like I knew it was temporary,

01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:43.300
but I didn't realize it would be disrupted

01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:44.140
like an hour later.

01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:50.220
And sort of to give you pushback to your statement

01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:54.820
about the possibility of the possibility

01:56:55.180 --> 01:57:00.180
of beauty and basically alleviating suffering,

01:57:02.900 --> 01:57:04.900
there's a quote I really like from Hunter S. Thompson

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.700
that pushes back against that,

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:09.180
which is, for every moment of triumph,

01:57:09.180 --> 01:57:11.580
for every instance of beauty,

01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:13.820
many souls must be trampled.

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:17.060
But that's a very Hunter S. Thompson,

01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:18.980
and you know how he ended up.

01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.660
He's not the greatest philosopher of all times,

01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:26.700
but he's certainly a beautiful, a chaotic human being.

01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:27.540
Well, that's true.

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.860
And I will tell you that my nickname for my husband

01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:32.780
is Gonzo, kind of because of him.

01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:35.100
He invented that form of Gonzo journalism

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:40.100
where like the writer is totally in the story.

01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:42.100
And my husband, like that's his personality.

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:43.980
He's like in everything that he does.

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:45.020
He's really in it.

01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.140
He's really present.

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.140
He just lives that way.

01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.500
So his name is Ken,

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:52.140
but I call him Gonzo like 90% of the time.

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:55.500
Well, then that's a beautiful way to end the season.

01:57:55.500 --> 01:57:57.020
This is thank you for your work.

01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.620
Thank you for being who you are.

01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.660
Thank you for initially, at least,

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:03.380
making me feel okay about being an introvert

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:05.900
and educating and making the rest of us feel great

01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:07.100
about being introverts.

01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:09.380
It's like half the world or whatever the heck it is.

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:10.420
It's a lot of people.

01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:13.580
Thank you for being you.

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:14.580
Thank you for talking today.

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:15.420
This is awesome.

01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.240
This is fun.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:17.080
Thank you so much.

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:18.420
It was so great to talk to you.

01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:20.180
And I think it was the,

01:58:20.180 --> 01:58:21.780
what I said to you when we first got connected

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:24.100
is thank you for your way of being in the world.

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:26.100
I really, really love it.

01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.940
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Susan Cain.

01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:31.100

01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:35.860
And now let me leave you with some words

01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:37.540
from Susan Cain herself.

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.500
The highly sensitive introvert

01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.820
tends to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation

01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:48.820
rather than materialistic or hedonistic.

01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:50.980
They dislike small talk.

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:54.780
They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:56.220
They dream vividly

01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:59.360
and can often recall their dreams the next day.

01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:04.060
They love music, nature, art, and physical beauty.

01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:06.620
They feel exceptionally strong emotions,

01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:09.300
sometimes acute bouts of joy,

01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:12.640
but also sorrow, melancholy, and fear.

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:15.380
Highly sensitive people also process information

01:59:15.380 --> 01:59:16.580
about their environments,

01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.740
both physical and emotional, unusually deeply.

01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.660
They tend to notice subtleties that others miss,

01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:25.900
another person's shift in mood

01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:30.040
or a light bulb burning a touch too brightly.

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.580
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
