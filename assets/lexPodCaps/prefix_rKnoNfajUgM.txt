00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
You could be the seventh best player in the whole world.

00:02.200 --> 00:03.920
Like, literally, seventh best player.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.480
But if you're playing with the other six,

00:06.480 --> 00:07.960
you're the sucker.

00:07.960 --> 00:10.840
You are the worst player in the game, right?

00:10.840 --> 00:13.600
So there's a lot of players, for example,

00:13.600 --> 00:15.440
like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.600
He's not a top level player,

00:17.600 --> 00:19.520
like these guys you see on TV,

00:19.520 --> 00:21.640
but he probably makes more money than they do

00:21.640 --> 00:23.040
because he plays with people

00:23.040 --> 00:24.680
that are far below his skill level.

00:24.680 --> 00:27.240
So part of the skill of being a poker player

00:27.280 --> 00:30.640
is finding situations where you're profitable,

00:30.640 --> 00:32.200
regardless of your skill level.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.640
The following is a conversation with Daniel Nagrano,

00:37.640 --> 00:40.560
one of the greatest poker players of all time.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.480
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.480
To support it, please check out our sponsors

00:44.480 --> 00:45.760
in the description.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.320
And now, dear friends, here's Daniel Nagrano.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.100
Everything everyone does at the poker table

00:52.100 --> 00:53.280
conveys information.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.480
So let me ask sort of the big overview question.

00:56.520 --> 00:59.080
What are the various sources of information

00:59.080 --> 01:02.320
that you project and others project at the table

01:02.320 --> 01:04.040
that convey information?

01:04.040 --> 01:05.240
Well, there's several different things.

01:05.240 --> 01:06.600
There's the ones that are conscious

01:06.600 --> 01:08.720
and then there's the ones that are subconscious, right?

01:08.720 --> 01:09.920
Like on the conscious level,

01:09.920 --> 01:12.000
it might be something someone says, right?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.800
You know, you ask them a question and they say,

01:13.800 --> 01:16.000
oh, you know, you shouldn't call me here, you should.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.480
So there's the verbal tells.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.200
There's also the more subconscious stuff,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.880
body posture, right?

01:21.880 --> 01:24.840
The eyes, the throat, the pulse,

01:24.840 --> 01:27.960
various things that are, you know, less controllable.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.080
I find I use a combination of both

01:30.080 --> 01:31.600
to try to gain information,

01:31.600 --> 01:34.880
but generally when I have somebody more comfortable,

01:34.880 --> 01:36.400
they give off more.

01:36.400 --> 01:37.740
Like everyone has a different approach.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.580
Phil Ivey likes to intimidate.

01:39.580 --> 01:40.480
I go the other way.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.740
I want my opponents to be relaxed

01:42.740 --> 01:44.640
so that they'll give me more in that regard.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.280
So Phil Ivey likes to perturb the system,

01:47.280 --> 01:50.520
like mess with it to see what comes out.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.480
I think Phil has an aura about him

01:52.480 --> 01:54.280
where he wants you to know

01:54.280 --> 01:58.080
that he's watching you, be afraid, be uncomfortable,

01:58.080 --> 02:00.800
because when you're uncomfortable, I got you, right?

02:00.800 --> 02:03.140
And that's sort of his shtick where he, you know,

02:03.140 --> 02:05.720
and people do, like when you sit at a table with Phil Ivey,

02:05.720 --> 02:06.560
it's intimidating.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.800
He likes to rule by fear

02:07.800 --> 02:10.080
and you like to rule by, what is it, love?

02:10.080 --> 02:11.260
That's a really good way to put it.

02:11.260 --> 02:12.760
I never had anyone put it like that,

02:12.760 --> 02:13.680
but it makes a lot of sense.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.080
Yeah, you know, fear Phil Ivey, and then with me,

02:16.080 --> 02:17.940
it's fine, don't worry, I'll take your money,

02:17.940 --> 02:19.840
but you're gonna enjoy it, it's great.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.800
So that's what the talking at the table is about,

02:21.800 --> 02:26.800
is get him to be relaxed and get some of that gray area

02:26.800 --> 02:28.400
between the conscious and the subconscious

02:28.400 --> 02:29.360
to reveal something.

02:29.360 --> 02:31.160
Yeah, there's that too, and also just, you know,

02:31.160 --> 02:32.680
and this is just part of who I am anyway,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.080
like I like to talk to people,

02:34.080 --> 02:36.560
but one of the byproducts is the more I know about you,

02:36.560 --> 02:38.280
the more I likely know about how you think

02:38.280 --> 02:39.720
about different situations, right?

02:39.720 --> 02:40.560
So what do you do for a living?

02:40.560 --> 02:43.600
Oh, I'm a lawyer, I defend criminals, okay.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.520
So this guy probably spends a lot of his time

02:45.520 --> 02:47.840
twisting the truth, trying to find, you know,

02:47.840 --> 02:50.320
and then, so then, you know, you already have a mindset

02:50.320 --> 02:52.000
like this guy might be more likely to bluff

02:52.000 --> 02:53.560
or he's probably comfortable doing that.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.280
Very subtle things like that.

02:55.280 --> 02:59.600
And you start to pick up cues on what nervousness

02:59.600 --> 03:01.280
looks like for this person,

03:01.280 --> 03:03.480
what the nervousness communicates, all that kind of stuff.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.560
So we're talking about physical tells here.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.440
Yeah, physical tells is a secondary thing.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.480
I was more specific in like player profiling, right?

03:10.480 --> 03:12.160
And sort of understanding the type of mind

03:12.160 --> 03:14.240
that I'm dealing with, right?

03:14.240 --> 03:17.880
So again, somebody who's a lawyer is used to trying,

03:17.880 --> 03:21.400
is fine with being deceptive as part of a game, right?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.760
Whereas maybe somebody's a Sunday school teacher

03:23.760 --> 03:25.800
and, you know, they don't feel comfortable,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.520
maybe they think bluffing might be dishonest, right?

03:28.520 --> 03:31.520
So they're less likely to try some shenanigans against you.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.320
So, and then the other thing too is

03:33.320 --> 03:38.320
what type of person is this in terms of their, you know,

03:38.680 --> 03:40.000
like view on life, right?

03:40.000 --> 03:40.840
Are they positive?

03:40.840 --> 03:44.000
Do they feel like things go their way or they're not, right?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.160
There's those people that always,

03:45.160 --> 03:47.960
well, of course I lost, I always lose with this hand.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.200
And those types of people you can manipulate

03:50.200 --> 03:54.280
because when a card comes that you don't have them beat,

03:54.280 --> 03:55.120
right?

03:55.120 --> 03:56.520
But you can pretend because they'll believe it.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.560
Like, of course you beat me.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.200
So you bet all your chips against them,

03:59.200 --> 04:00.600
knowing that you can scare them

04:00.600 --> 04:03.800
because they already feel like they're gonna lose.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.960
The inherent, like the cynicism.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.800
Exactly.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.360
Cynicism is easier to play against

04:08.360 --> 04:10.720
because you can convince them that their cards suck.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.680
Yeah, when somebody believes that they're a loser

04:12.680 --> 04:14.240
or they're unlucky, right?

04:14.240 --> 04:16.080
And that bad things happen to them always

04:16.080 --> 04:17.560
and they never catch a break.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.560
Well, you know, you can just help them make it true.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.920
What do you think about the rounders Teddy KGB

04:24.920 --> 04:26.960
when he does the Oreo tell?

04:26.960 --> 04:30.120
Do players at the high level communicate that kind of stuff?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.120
Do you think it's realistic

04:31.120 --> 04:32.360
to be able to have a tell like this

04:32.360 --> 04:34.480
that's partially subconscious?

04:34.480 --> 04:37.400
So first of all, I love Brian Koppelman who made the film.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.360
And I think what they were going for

04:39.360 --> 04:41.880
is something obvious to the general public, right?

04:41.880 --> 04:43.160
Like, okay, it's very clear.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.000
You know, he eats the cookie.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.000
He doesn't eat the cookie and it means one or the other.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.360
At the highest levels, something that, you know,

04:49.360 --> 04:50.960
blatant, you're not gonna find.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.480
You're gonna find a lot more subtle things,

04:52.480 --> 04:55.400
maybe with posture or timing or, you know,

04:55.400 --> 04:56.320
different things like that.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.280
But at the lower levels, you know, you might see some,

05:00.280 --> 05:02.320
you might see, you know, with a lot of people,

05:02.320 --> 05:03.880
when they're in a hand and they've bet

05:03.880 --> 05:06.080
whether they drink water in the hand

05:06.080 --> 05:08.200
is going to tell you something, generally speaking.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.920
There's such an intimate part of the human experience

05:09.920 --> 05:11.320
that I feel like if you have food,

05:11.320 --> 05:13.120
you're gonna reveal something about yourself

05:13.160 --> 05:14.320
through the way you eat.

05:14.320 --> 05:15.640
I feel like that's a dangerous thing

05:15.640 --> 05:16.480
to have at the table.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.280
Well, the thing is, generally speaking,

05:18.280 --> 05:20.160
people don't eat food in the middle of a hand.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.680
Like, they're not gonna bet and then just like,

05:21.680 --> 05:23.120
grab a burger, right?

05:23.120 --> 05:24.640
What they will do though is, you know,

05:24.640 --> 05:26.760
they bet and it's up to you and then they're,

05:26.760 --> 05:29.280
whether they're uncomfortable or they do it unconsciously,

05:29.280 --> 05:31.760
they just wanna do something to make themselves

05:31.760 --> 05:33.120
look relaxed or whatever and then, you know,

05:33.120 --> 05:35.400
they grab a water where they don't really need it

05:35.400 --> 05:37.440
in that moment, but they're trying to take your mind

05:37.440 --> 05:39.240
off of the situation.

05:39.240 --> 05:43.720
So they, in the movie, wanted to show a simplistic version

05:43.720 --> 05:45.200
of something that does happen,

05:45.200 --> 05:48.400
something that's visually sort of clear.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.800
Yeah, cause I think one of the things Rounders got right

05:50.800 --> 05:52.360
is that it's a poker movie, right?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.120
But you don't have to be great at poker

05:54.120 --> 05:56.160
or really understand poker to enjoy the movie

05:56.160 --> 05:58.280
and that, you know, Oreo cookie-tell,

05:58.280 --> 05:59.880
like, everyone gets that.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.240
They're like, okay, that's simple.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.240
If you would've went with something more subtle,

06:03.240 --> 06:06.640
you know, like licking your lips or looking to the right,

06:06.640 --> 06:09.080
and I think it might've been lost on the audience.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.160
And they didn't actually explicitly say

06:12.160 --> 06:14.240
that that was a tell, I don't think.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.720
They thought they did everything to let you know, right?

06:17.720 --> 06:21.360
With the music and slow motion and he's staring at it

06:21.360 --> 06:22.680
and he's like, aha.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.400
Yeah, but they didn't actually say, you know,

06:25.400 --> 06:26.680
this is an obvious tell.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.520
Like, uh, Matt Damon's character didn't talk.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
At the very end of it, you know, after he says,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.520
how the fuck did you lay that down?

06:33.520 --> 06:34.360
The monster.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.960
Right, and he's like, he's like, you're not hungry?

06:37.960 --> 06:38.800
Not hungry, KGB?

06:39.720 --> 06:41.800
You know, so he sort of references it

06:41.800 --> 06:42.720
and then he takes the cookies.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.480
He notices, he's like, ah, he got me

06:44.480 --> 06:46.160
and he breaks the, you know, the racket.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.440
Well, probably if you had that kind of tell on him,

06:48.440 --> 06:51.520
you wouldn't, and Matt Damon's character would not reveal.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.400
Well, he says in the movie, he says,

06:53.400 --> 06:54.840
normally I wouldn't reveal a tell,

06:54.840 --> 06:56.600
but I don't have that much time.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.440
Like, I've got to rattle him some way.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.600
So that was one way to do that.

07:00.600 --> 07:05.000
How hard is it to do that to, in a KGB accent,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.320
to lay down a monster in those situations?

07:08.640 --> 07:10.800
In general, how hard is it to lay down

07:10.800 --> 07:13.240
a really strong hand, just psychologically?

07:13.240 --> 07:15.120
Yeah, no, I mean, I think it's incredibly difficult

07:15.120 --> 07:16.640
for the vast majority of people.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.160
You know, part of what makes professionals

07:18.160 --> 07:20.640
really, really good is recognizing a situation

07:20.640 --> 07:22.840
that's very, very dangerous and they need to, you know,

07:22.840 --> 07:25.200
jump ship, like what happens to a lot of players

07:25.200 --> 07:26.520
is you get married to a hand.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.880
Let's say you have pocket aces,

07:27.880 --> 07:29.760
which is the best possible hand, right?

07:29.760 --> 07:32.880
But the board runs out where it's seven, eight, nine,

07:32.880 --> 07:34.680
and then there's a jack and then there's a six.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.920
It's like, you have a great hand to start,

07:36.920 --> 07:37.800
but you don't anymore.

07:37.800 --> 07:40.480
So one of the difficult things for the average player

07:40.480 --> 07:43.720
is, you know, once they've put money in,

07:43.720 --> 07:44.960
cutting their losses and saying,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.640
okay, let's move on to the next hand.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.160
It's very, very difficult thing for a lot of people.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.880
At every stage of like pre-flop, all the way through,

07:52.880 --> 07:55.640
be able to just make a decision at that moment.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.400
So yeah, essentially not being attached.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.440
Okay, I've already put in $40,000 in this pot

08:00.440 --> 08:02.240
and this guy's bet another 20.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.320
Well, I mean, I gotta get my 40 back, right?

08:04.320 --> 08:06.200
Except, you know, in some cases,

08:06.200 --> 08:09.320
you have to reassess individually this situation

08:09.320 --> 08:11.040
and realize, all right, well, this is a bad investment.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.440
So I gotta cut my losses.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.400
By the way, I should mention that you have,

08:15.400 --> 08:17.000
you have an incredible YouTube channel

08:17.000 --> 08:19.600
where you explain a lot of stuff, you do a podcast,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.200
you do a lot of really awesome stuff.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.600
My probably favorite thing that you've done

08:23.600 --> 08:27.280
is your masterclass that people should definitely check out,

08:27.280 --> 08:29.800
masterclass.com slash Lex.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.640
There you go.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.560
No, but it really is one of my favorite masterclass courses,

08:35.600 --> 08:38.560
but also just a great introduction, overview of poker.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.360
It's great for people that like me

08:40.360 --> 08:42.600
who are beginners, essentially.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.400
But it's probably really good for intermediate people too.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.440
I mean, there's a lot of really good detail there.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.840
Anyway, what are hand ranges

08:48.840 --> 08:51.040
and how do you begin to estimate the range of hands

08:51.040 --> 08:52.240
that your opponents have?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.120
Yeah, so I actually, speaking to YouTube,

08:54.120 --> 08:55.520
I did a video on specifically this,

08:55.520 --> 08:56.480
getting familiar with Rangers.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.760
And essentially, you know, back in my day, the old days,

08:58.760 --> 09:00.360
we didn't talk about poker that way.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.520
We're like, I think he's got this

09:01.520 --> 09:03.960
or I think he's got that, right?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.680
Nobody thought of like the range of hands a player can have.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.200
So I guess the best example is,

09:08.200 --> 09:09.800
imagine like all the potential hands

09:09.800 --> 09:11.800
as being a part of a grid, right?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.600
So the first player to act,

09:13.600 --> 09:16.120
they could have any one of those hands, right?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.080
Anyone randomly dealt, right?

09:18.080 --> 09:22.080
But let's say now that that player raised to $3,000.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.560
Okay, well, you can eliminate now from this grid,

09:24.560 --> 09:27.160
a whole bunch of hands that this player can no longer have

09:27.160 --> 09:28.560
because if they had a two and a three,

09:28.560 --> 09:29.800
they wouldn't do that.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.440
So you can say, okay, he probably has a big pair.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.640
He has ace-king.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.720
You've narrowed the range of hands down, right?

09:36.720 --> 09:39.600
Now, through every action on the flop, on the turn,

09:39.600 --> 09:41.760
and on the river, based on the decisions they make,

09:41.760 --> 09:43.800
you narrow it down even further.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.520
So the range of hands is the entirety

09:47.520 --> 09:49.240
of all the possibilities that this player

09:49.240 --> 09:50.200
you believe could have.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.360
And sometimes they fool you or they have a hand

09:52.360 --> 09:54.240
that you don't expect them to have in their range.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.920
And you know, maybe a little bit unorthodox,

09:56.920 --> 09:59.280
doing some things you don't expect to throw you off.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.920
But a range is essentially all the possibilities

10:01.920 --> 10:03.360
and it narrows.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.160
Before the flop, it's endless.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.280
Player raises, okay, it's minimized.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.440
You know, a player bets the flop,

10:08.440 --> 10:09.560
okay, it's minimized further.

10:09.560 --> 10:12.560
And then by the river, you know, you can narrow down

10:12.560 --> 10:15.160
the entire range to, you know, just maybe even a few hands.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.880
Is it always shrinking or is there sort of,

10:17.880 --> 10:19.520
as you get surprised?

10:19.520 --> 10:21.480
I mean, it's always just an estimate.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.120
So does it ever expand based on sort of

10:24.120 --> 10:29.120
chaotic, unpredicted, surprising behavior of the players?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.720
It really should never expand.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.680
The range of hands should always get smaller, right?

10:32.680 --> 10:35.200
Like again, we start with the full scope

10:35.200 --> 10:37.000
and then you should factor in like, okay,

10:37.000 --> 10:37.960
these are all the possible hands

10:37.960 --> 10:39.960
you can have on the flop now, right?

10:39.960 --> 10:42.000
We can't have new hands on the turn.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.280
And if you get to that point where you think,

10:44.280 --> 10:45.960
oh, well, maybe he has this hand,

10:45.960 --> 10:49.040
then you sort of misjudged his range prior.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.440
So you're not thinking clearly.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.840
It should always shrink from the full scope

10:53.840 --> 10:55.640
to, you know, hopefully just a couple.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.640
Well, in that video, you also talk about,

10:57.640 --> 10:59.760
it used to be that you would play your hand,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.080
but now you're playing a range

11:02.320 --> 11:03.560
you're representing a range.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.640
You're not even just playing your hand.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.760
So what does it mean to represent a certain range?

11:08.760 --> 11:09.920
Yeah, so that's another big thing

11:09.920 --> 11:11.480
that's different about poker from, you know,

11:11.480 --> 11:13.840
my day to today is that back in our day,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.520
we would like put people on one hand.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.280
I'm like, you probably have King nine

11:17.280 --> 11:19.200
or you have Jacks or something like that.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.160
Now people are cognizant of the idea

11:21.160 --> 11:23.000
that you could have an entire range of hands.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.800
So then you ask yourself in situations,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.600
all right, I know what I have,

11:26.600 --> 11:29.160
but what I could have in his mind

11:29.160 --> 11:31.280
or my opponent's mind is any one of these hands.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.000
What would I do with the entirety of these hands?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.240
And so a lot of people that are trying to play optimally,

11:36.240 --> 11:37.680
you know, game theory optimal,

11:37.680 --> 11:41.200
they think in terms of what their range of hands would do

11:41.200 --> 11:43.720
rather than their very specific hand.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.040
So is bluffing in that context

11:46.040 --> 11:48.880
essentially misrepresenting the range of hands

11:48.880 --> 11:49.840
that you have?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.120
No. Is that how you think about it?

11:51.120 --> 11:53.200
Not exactly, because so an optimal range,

11:53.200 --> 11:54.600
like if I bet the river,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.600
if I'm playing game theory optimal,

11:56.600 --> 11:58.320
a portion of my range is going to be,

11:58.320 --> 12:00.120
I have it, I got the best hand

12:00.120 --> 12:01.840
and a portion of my range is going to be bluffs

12:01.840 --> 12:03.360
and they'll be balanced.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.760
So in theory, no matter what you do,

12:05.760 --> 12:08.080
no matter what you do, if you call or you fold,

12:08.080 --> 12:11.600
in theory, it's just, you're printing a zero as we say,

12:11.600 --> 12:14.440
you're not gaining or losing an EV

12:14.440 --> 12:15.360
if you were to do it that way.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.240
What's EV?

12:16.240 --> 12:18.120
EV is expected value, right?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.960
So every play that you make, you know,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.920
it either is going to in the long run,

12:21.920 --> 12:24.360
you know, make you some money or it's just a losing play.

12:24.360 --> 12:25.320
And as a professional,

12:25.320 --> 12:29.160
you try to make the fewest amount of minus EV plays you can.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.840
And the only reason you would make these minus EV plays

12:31.840 --> 12:34.120
is potentially if you were trying to set up your opponent

12:34.120 --> 12:35.720
for something later, right?

12:35.720 --> 12:38.640
So I might make some minus EV plays, right?

12:38.640 --> 12:40.480
So that I can exploit you later, right?

12:40.480 --> 12:44.040
So you're building up a player profile

12:44.040 --> 12:45.480
that's false in some way.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.320
Something that I'm going to,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.960
I'm going to plant seeds in your mind

12:47.960 --> 12:49.520
so that I can exploit them later.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.960
So for example, why would players like show a big bluff?

12:52.960 --> 12:54.720
Like what would be the reason for that?

12:54.720 --> 12:55.560
They show a big bluff

12:55.560 --> 12:57.280
so that you know that they're capable of it.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.240
But maybe in their mind,

12:58.240 --> 12:59.800
they're never going to do that again.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.440
But now they think, you know, he bluffed me last time.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.560
Maybe he's doing it again.

13:03.560 --> 13:06.760
But that's what we call like a leveling more

13:06.760 --> 13:08.240
because it, you know,

13:08.240 --> 13:10.000
you can go back and forth with whether or not,

13:10.000 --> 13:11.560
okay, this guy might know that.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.480
Like he showed a bluff

13:12.480 --> 13:14.320
because he's never going to bluff me again.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.840
So that that's where it gets a little.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.960
So that's a little bit different

13:17.960 --> 13:19.640
though when we're talking about hand rangers,

13:19.640 --> 13:23.200
that's different than building up a mental model

13:23.200 --> 13:26.840
of what your opponents think of you

13:27.840 --> 13:30.760
and what your opponents think that you think of them

13:30.760 --> 13:32.280
and so on and so forth.

13:32.280 --> 13:35.680
Are you trying to construct those kinds of mental models?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.360
And is that separate from the hand ranges?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.000
They go hand in hand, right?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.280
So if in a given situation, right?

13:41.280 --> 13:45.640
My range has this many value hands and this many bluffs, okay?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.920
So in theory, if I want to be balanced,

13:47.920 --> 13:49.840
you know, this is my range and this is what it looks like.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.560
I'll bet this 50% of the time, bet this 50% of the time.

13:52.680 --> 13:57.480
However, if I know that you think that I bluff too much,

13:57.480 --> 13:59.080
right, then I'm not going to bluff as much.

13:59.080 --> 13:59.920
I'm going to start,

13:59.920 --> 14:02.120
instead of betting these hands that I would 50-50,

14:02.120 --> 14:04.640
now what I'll do is I'll do like 70-30

14:04.640 --> 14:06.160
where I'm basically value betting

14:06.160 --> 14:08.640
most of the time against you, you know, or vice versa.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.000
If I know you always fold because you think I have it,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.360
I'm going to veer the other way.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.520
And instead of bluffing 50%, I'll bluff 70-80% of the time

14:15.520 --> 14:17.640
to take advantage of your perception of me.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.040
So to be successful,

14:19.040 --> 14:22.040
do you have to construct a solid model

14:22.040 --> 14:26.640
of all the players in the game or can you ignore them?

14:26.640 --> 14:27.960
I think it's really important.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.920
Like when I play, I have in my phone,

14:29.920 --> 14:32.240
I have a player profile of everyone that I play with

14:32.240 --> 14:34.080
whenever I pick up, whether it's physical tells

14:34.080 --> 14:38.800
or tendencies they like to, you know, that they have.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.240
And overall, that's just going to, you know,

14:41.240 --> 14:43.880
that's going to allow you to exploit more, right?

14:43.880 --> 14:46.560
So like if I played with somebody I've never played before,

14:46.560 --> 14:48.680
I'm probably just going to play optimally

14:48.680 --> 14:50.560
or at least as optimal as I know how

14:50.600 --> 14:51.880
until I start to, you know,

14:51.880 --> 14:53.400
gain some information on that player

14:53.400 --> 14:55.520
so that I can start to exploit them.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.440
So what's the, when you say optimally,

14:57.440 --> 14:59.520
what does optimally mean versus,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.440
so game theory optimal versus exploitative?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.680
Yeah, so that's like sort of the big debate in poker.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.720
We call it for short GTO,

15:08.720 --> 15:11.600
game theory optimal versus exploitative play.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.200
So GTO, game theory optimal is the idea that no,

15:15.200 --> 15:16.960
like I'm going to set up my play

15:16.960 --> 15:20.440
so that no matter what you do, you cannot exploit me.

15:20.440 --> 15:24.000
So essentially that's playing rock, paper, scissors, right?

15:24.000 --> 15:27.680
And throwing 33% of each every time, right?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.960
Nothing you do can beat that, nothing.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.040
You'll never be able to beat that, right?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.480
Exploitative play is starting to notice that, okay,

15:34.480 --> 15:36.240
well, you know what, this guy loves rock.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.880
He loves playing rock.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.520
So I'm going to go paper a little more.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.640
So I'm going to take advantage of him.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.240
So I won't be through, but now all of a sudden,

15:42.240 --> 15:44.480
when I do that, I'm no longer playing optimal

15:44.480 --> 15:46.280
because if you knew that I was making that adjustment,

15:46.280 --> 15:47.960
now you can exploit me.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.200
So that's where the sort of what we call

15:49.200 --> 15:52.640
the Leveling War happens, where people veer from,

15:52.640 --> 15:56.440
the optimal line of, okay, 33% each for each one.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.720
You can't beat that, but you also can't win

15:59.720 --> 16:00.840
with that either.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.240
So you're always trying to be at the cutting,

16:03.240 --> 16:06.120
at the leading edge of suboptimal play.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.240
Yeah, you're going back and forth.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.000
And listen, at the highest levels,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
like online that these guys play,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
like they're trying to play pretty close

16:13.000 --> 16:15.120
to like game theory optimal

16:15.120 --> 16:16.520
because it's very difficult to do first of all.

16:16.520 --> 16:20.040
No human being will ever be able to compute

16:20.040 --> 16:21.640
at the level that computers can.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.400
It's just never going to happen.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.640
So that's where like the human mind has to come into play

16:26.640 --> 16:28.480
and say, all right, well, you know,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.200
if I was playing against the robot, I would do X,

16:30.200 --> 16:31.880
but I'm not, I'm playing against you.

16:31.880 --> 16:32.880
So I have to adjust.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.160
So does game theory optimal only look at the bedding

16:36.160 --> 16:40.560
and the hands in the current hand

16:40.560 --> 16:42.280
or does it look at the history?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.600
So if you were to play optimally, optimally,

16:44.640 --> 16:46.320
would you need to look at the history

16:46.320 --> 16:47.280
of the individual players

16:47.280 --> 16:49.440
or just every hand is taken afresh?

16:49.440 --> 16:52.040
See, that's why I love playing exploitatively

16:52.040 --> 16:54.840
for the most part because with GTO,

16:54.840 --> 16:56.320
anything that's happened in the past

16:56.320 --> 16:58.200
has no bearing on this situation.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.720
It's simply based on what is the optimal play

17:00.720 --> 17:02.360
in a vacuum in this spot.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.880
Whereas exploitatively, okay,

17:03.880 --> 17:06.160
this guy bluffs way too much in these spots.

17:06.160 --> 17:09.000
So now I can make an adjustment and call more, you know,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.040
based on past information.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.160
GTO doesn't take into account history at all.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.320
So like in a tournament,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.720
how quickly can you construct a player profile

17:17.720 --> 17:19.400
that you've never played before?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.400
Depends on the level of the buy-in really, right?

17:22.400 --> 17:25.600
So the higher the buy-in, generally speaking,

17:25.600 --> 17:27.480
you can assume if they're professionals

17:27.480 --> 17:29.640
that they're gonna have pretty similar profiles

17:29.640 --> 17:31.080
because, you know, everyone's playing,

17:31.080 --> 17:32.600
you know, if you're playing this game well,

17:32.600 --> 17:34.680
it looks similar, right?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.880
At the lower levels, you know,

17:35.880 --> 17:39.040
playing say in 1,000 or $1,500 buy-in or less,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.840
you know, within a half an hour, an hour,

17:41.840 --> 17:43.040
I have an idea of, all right,

17:43.040 --> 17:46.440
just by seeing how some players played a few hands,

17:46.440 --> 17:48.000
that, you know, so here's the thing with poker.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.120
It's like, I can see one clue of what he did,

17:50.120 --> 17:51.800
and it tells me so much about what he'll do

17:51.800 --> 17:53.960
in a vast number of scenarios.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.160
And you're saying at the high level,

17:55.160 --> 17:56.480
people don't get too many clues.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.320
I mean, then-

17:57.320 --> 17:59.160
Well, at the highest level,

17:59.160 --> 18:00.520
people are so much more similar

18:00.520 --> 18:02.240
in terms of their style of play.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.960
They try to find some kind of balance between the GTO

18:04.960 --> 18:05.800
and they-

18:05.800 --> 18:07.280
And now with all that we've seen on TV, right?

18:07.280 --> 18:08.920
Like people get to watch streams and whatever.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.880
So you get to watch all the top players play.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.000
So if you wanna learn how to play better,

18:12.000 --> 18:12.880
guess what you do?

18:13.720 --> 18:15.280
You copy what they're doing, essentially.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.760
Like, oh, he's only raising this much.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.880
I'm gonna do the same.

18:17.880 --> 18:18.720
They're betting this much.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.680
I'm gonna do the same.

18:19.680 --> 18:24.200
So as a result, what you end up having is sort of,

18:25.480 --> 18:26.920
you know, everyone deciding.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.800
Like, I guess it's similar in chess with openings, right?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.120
People figure out, okay, this is an opening.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.280
This is what you do.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.120
And that's it, you know?

18:32.120 --> 18:33.720
And then everyone's similar to that.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.400
And then you have, of course, the outliers

18:35.400 --> 18:37.080
who try to do things a little differently

18:37.080 --> 18:38.680
and confuse people.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.800
It seems like the outliers,

18:39.800 --> 18:41.680
like we talked offline that Magnus,

18:41.760 --> 18:44.840
to win, Magnus Carlsen has to play suboptimally

18:44.840 --> 18:47.320
in the openings to take it,

18:47.320 --> 18:49.360
take his opponents out of the comfort zone

18:49.360 --> 18:51.560
so he can play what he calls pure chess

18:51.560 --> 18:52.920
as quickly as possible,

18:52.920 --> 18:56.320
which is just both short and deep calculations,

18:56.320 --> 18:57.800
purely what you're looking at the board

18:57.800 --> 19:01.760
versus memorized openings and memorized lines.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.480
Is it the case that the best poker players

19:05.480 --> 19:09.800
are the ones that are able to, at the right time,

19:09.800 --> 19:14.800
play really suboptimally or really unorthodox?

19:15.520 --> 19:17.120
Yeah, specifically there's one guy

19:17.120 --> 19:19.600
who last year sort of took the poker world by storm

19:19.600 --> 19:21.160
and his name was Michael Adamo.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.880
And he was doing things, like I said,

19:22.880 --> 19:25.120
you know, most of the top pros play very similarly

19:25.120 --> 19:27.320
with the way that they, you know, construct ranges

19:27.320 --> 19:28.880
and their bet sizing and all these kinds of things.

19:28.880 --> 19:32.760
He was doing some crazy things that nobody else was doing.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.560
So he studied, you know,

19:34.560 --> 19:38.120
sort of a different form of poker and it was unorthodox

19:38.120 --> 19:40.360
and it, you know, it throws people off

19:40.360 --> 19:41.720
because he's in his comfort zone

19:41.720 --> 19:43.360
with these bet sizes and different things,

19:43.360 --> 19:45.960
whereas everyone else, they're not well studied

19:45.960 --> 19:46.800
in those spots.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.200
So as a result of him being unorthodox,

19:49.200 --> 19:51.640
he became like a monster and very difficult to play against

19:51.640 --> 19:53.080
because he really knew what he was doing with it.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.760
In tournament or cash games?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.920
He was tournaments, yeah, he was crushing tournaments.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.120
He was going against the norm in terms of what is like,

20:00.120 --> 20:01.800
you know, this is what you should do

20:01.800 --> 20:02.720
as a poker player in this spot.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.160
He wasn't doing that.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.800
He was doing what he thought was best

20:05.800 --> 20:07.120
and he was doing things outside the norm

20:07.480 --> 20:08.320
that again, in a vacuum,

20:08.320 --> 20:10.920
you could look at that and you go, that's incorrect.

20:10.920 --> 20:11.920
That he should not do.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.720
That is a clear cut mistake.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.240
Even, you know, the solvers or the computers

20:16.240 --> 20:18.520
or game theory would say, this is wrong what he's doing,

20:18.520 --> 20:21.400
but it's not wrong if he's doing it in a way

20:21.400 --> 20:24.200
that he's exploiting other players' tendencies.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
So for example, with him,

20:26.200 --> 20:28.640
say he's playing far too aggressively, okay?

20:28.640 --> 20:31.280
That's not good unless your opponents

20:31.280 --> 20:33.000
are playing way too passively.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.720
So if your opponents are playing passively,

20:34.720 --> 20:36.440
the answer is to be more aggressive with them

20:36.480 --> 20:38.040
and that's, I think one of the, you know,

20:38.040 --> 20:40.840
biggest advantages he had was he was willing to do that.

20:40.840 --> 20:44.440
So bet big pots, bluffing.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.280
Huge.

20:45.280 --> 20:47.520
So in a spot where somebody would make it a thousand,

20:47.520 --> 20:49.640
he's making it 22,000.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.480
What?

20:50.480 --> 20:51.320
What is this?

20:51.320 --> 20:52.160
This makes no sense.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.760
And then people kind of know he has nothing,

20:53.760 --> 20:56.360
but they're too afraid to call him on it.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.200
Well, and then sometimes what happens is

20:58.200 --> 20:59.360
this is where the leveling comes in.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.600
You're like, oh man, this guy's crazy.

21:00.600 --> 21:01.640
He's bluffing like nuts.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.040
Then he bets the 22,000 and you say,

21:04.040 --> 21:05.640
ah, I'm taking my stand, I call.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.760
And then he shows you like, you know,

21:07.760 --> 21:09.480
four of a kind or something like that.

21:09.480 --> 21:11.200
So he gets people out of their comfort zone

21:11.200 --> 21:12.560
and I really enjoy watching him play.

21:12.560 --> 21:15.800
He's probably my favorite player to watch today.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.880
Watching a guy like that.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.320
What aspect of his play have you been able

21:19.320 --> 21:20.840
to incorporate into your own?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.160
Like, what do you learn from that?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.000
Because you're constantly learning,

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
you're constantly adjusting.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.840
Yeah.

21:24.840 --> 21:25.680
Well, no, and I love it.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.160
And as I said, so I think a lot of players

21:27.160 --> 21:28.680
sort of come to the same conclusions

21:28.680 --> 21:30.840
about this is how you play the spot, but he doesn't.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.760
And I love watching and thinking in terms of like,

21:32.760 --> 21:33.840
why he's doing this.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.520
And one specific thing, for example,

21:35.520 --> 21:38.360
is he's willing to really go for it.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.720
So in a spot where let's say he bets 2,000,

21:40.720 --> 21:43.800
he knows he'll get you to call 2,000, right?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.520
But he wants it all.

21:45.520 --> 21:46.400
He wants it all.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.840
So he says, you know what?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.360
I'll give up the 2,000 that's guaranteed

21:50.360 --> 21:52.800
and I'll bet 50,000.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.320
And maybe if you call that now, you know, so listen,

21:55.320 --> 21:57.120
you lose the 2,000 seven, eight times,

21:57.120 --> 21:59.720
but if I get called for the 50 just once,

21:59.720 --> 22:01.320
you know, I'm profiting from that.

22:01.320 --> 22:05.120
And it also sets the, you know, the template for you

22:05.120 --> 22:07.040
to really sort of be a player

22:07.040 --> 22:08.120
that people are afraid to play against.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.080
He knocked me out in a tournament very early on

22:11.080 --> 22:12.200
in a huge event.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.840
And he was so far ahead, he was one step ahead

22:15.840 --> 22:17.520
of my thought process in hand.

22:17.520 --> 22:19.920
And he did something that makes no sense whatsoever.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.400
I looked it up on the computer.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.320
Huge mistake, if you will, but not a mistake

22:24.320 --> 22:25.880
because he was taking advantage of my tendency.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.520
Do you remember the cars as an example?

22:27.520 --> 22:28.360
I remember the whole thing.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.080
Yeah, I remember like it was yesterday.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.200
Can you take it like through an example hand

22:33.200 --> 22:34.800
that really demonstrates it?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.240
So I'll explain the hand here.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.440
So I'm on the button and I have Ace King,

22:39.440 --> 22:40.800
which is a very good hand.

22:40.800 --> 22:43.800
And I raise and he calls from the big blind.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.440
The flop is nine, seven, five.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.040
So I have nothing really here.

22:47.040 --> 22:49.240
He checks, I check behind.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.320
The turn card's an Ace.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.560
He checks, I bet half the pot.

22:53.560 --> 22:56.800
There were 6,000 in there, I bet 3,000, okay?

22:56.800 --> 22:59.120
Now this is not a typical thing you see people do,

22:59.120 --> 23:01.720
but he raised me to 36,000.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.520
Massive raise, bigger than the size of the pot.

23:04.520 --> 23:05.680
What was the flop again?

23:05.680 --> 23:07.280
Nine, seven, five.

23:07.280 --> 23:08.120
Turn an Ace.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.000
What is he representing exactly?

23:10.000 --> 23:10.840
Well, he could have a straight,

23:10.840 --> 23:12.160
he could have three of a kind,

23:12.160 --> 23:14.720
he could have Aces up, he could have a whole bunch of hands.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.920
So he check raises me big to 36,000.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.120
I call the bet.

23:18.120 --> 23:20.040
So now there's something like 75,000.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.600
The river is a five.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.640
So the board pairs, okay?

23:26.800 --> 23:29.000
He thinks for a while and he bets all of it.

23:29.880 --> 23:30.720
Which is three times the pot.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.280
He bets 225,000.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.720
There's only 75,000 now, right?

23:34.720 --> 23:36.960
And in theory, he should never ever have a hand

23:36.960 --> 23:38.640
that can do that, right?

23:38.640 --> 23:40.720
So it confused me and I was like, okay,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.680
well this guy's aggressive, he likes to bluff

23:42.680 --> 23:43.520
and all this kind of stuff.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.280
So I made the call with the Ace King

23:45.280 --> 23:47.200
and he turned over six, eight.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.800
So he had a straight.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.960
But here's the thing, in theory,

23:50.960 --> 23:52.920
that river card is bad for him.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.960
When I call the turn, I have a lot of the time,

23:55.960 --> 23:58.320
three of a kind, two pair that just made a full house.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.640
So he was risking that.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.840
And the reason he did it was because he thought

24:01.840 --> 24:05.480
I would perceive him to be bluffing a lot.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.520
So he just went for it and it worked.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.240
He was able to double up right away

24:09.240 --> 24:11.160
and knock me out of the tournament like an hour in.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.600
Do you think he thought you might fold?

24:12.600 --> 24:13.440
Like what is it?

24:13.440 --> 24:15.120
I think it came down to this.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.000
It's as simple as this.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.560
He was cognizant of his image

24:19.560 --> 24:21.680
as being a wild aggressive bluffer, right?

24:21.680 --> 24:24.240
And he was fully taking advantage of me,

24:24.240 --> 24:27.560
knowing that my tendency in these spots is to be curious.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.400
And I want to call and I want to see it.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.760
So he was fully taking advantage of the fact

24:31.760 --> 24:33.520
that he thought I would call too often.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.800
Because otherwise his play makes no sense.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.000
A small bet, a medium sized bet, those make sense.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.800
But the bet that he made, in theory, is indefensible.

24:42.800 --> 24:45.160
It's just like clearly a mistake.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.040
But that's why poker is so fascinating

24:47.040 --> 24:48.880
because he makes this play and it wasn't a mistake.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.840
It was above the rim, is what it was.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.320
Do you think he put you on ace something?

24:53.320 --> 24:54.760
I think exactly what he thought I had.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.560
Was ace-king or something like that?

24:57.840 --> 24:58.680
That is so fun.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.200
That is so fun that the two players at such a high level

25:01.200 --> 25:03.680
were able to mess with each other's mind.

25:03.680 --> 25:04.520
How old is he?

25:04.520 --> 25:05.360
Is he young?

25:05.360 --> 25:06.200
He's in his twenties, yeah.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.720
I feel like that takes a lot of guts

25:07.720 --> 25:10.000
to take risks like that.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.240
Well, that's what's great about him.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.400
He's certainly never accused

25:12.400 --> 25:13.760
of not having the guts to put it in.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.480
And that's scary to play against, right?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.960
The easiest opponent to play against

25:16.960 --> 25:20.440
is one who's just straightforward, passive,

25:20.440 --> 25:21.600
not wild and crazy.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.080
Playing against him,

25:23.120 --> 25:25.040
he's gonna put you in the blender, as we say.

25:25.040 --> 25:25.880
Yeah.

25:26.920 --> 25:31.920
How can you control what you're perceived as representing?

25:31.920 --> 25:34.320
What hand you're perceived of as representing?

25:34.320 --> 25:38.360
So if the game of modern poker is

25:38.360 --> 25:40.520
others are representing certain hands

25:40.520 --> 25:42.240
through the information they convey

25:42.240 --> 25:45.800
and you're representing a certain hand range, sorry,

25:45.800 --> 25:47.520
through your play, how can you control that?

25:47.520 --> 25:50.720
Or is that not, is that the wrong way to think about it?

25:50.720 --> 25:54.160
But isn't bluffing and bet sizing

25:54.160 --> 25:57.360
and all of that kind of stuff essentially controlling

25:57.360 --> 26:01.160
what others perceive as the hand range you have?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.960
Ultimately, in terms of controlling

26:03.960 --> 26:06.480
people's perception of you, you can't fully control it,

26:06.480 --> 26:10.680
but you can do things to sway it, right?

26:10.680 --> 26:13.080
As I said earlier, showing bluffs and things like that

26:13.080 --> 26:15.080
leads your opponent to think maybe you do this

26:15.080 --> 26:16.200
more often than you're supposed to

26:16.200 --> 26:17.040
or whatever the case may be.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.280
But in terms of controlling

26:22.600 --> 26:24.600
what your opponent can think about your hands

26:24.600 --> 26:27.360
in certain spots, I don't really think it equates that way.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.000
I think what people do when they're playing a hand

26:29.000 --> 26:31.160
is they think in terms of, all right,

26:31.160 --> 26:33.720
what does my range look like here, okay?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.440
So my range has value.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.840
So you look at the actual hand you have secondarily.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.320
So you say, okay, well, I could have this,

26:41.320 --> 26:43.760
I could have this, I actually have this, right?

26:43.760 --> 26:44.800
But I could have all these hands.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.720
So my opponent, if he's thinking on a high level,

26:46.720 --> 26:49.040
he knows I could have all these hands and I have this one.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.680
So what do I do with this one, right,

26:50.680 --> 26:52.120
in the bigger scope of things?

26:52.120 --> 26:55.840
I guess I'm trying to understand if your betting

26:55.840 --> 26:58.960
isn't a bet pre-flop, your bet,

26:58.960 --> 27:01.440
doesn't that narrow the hand ranges?

27:01.440 --> 27:04.600
Doesn't matter what you have, it narrows the end.

27:04.600 --> 27:05.520
Absolutely.

27:05.520 --> 27:10.520
And if you bet big combined with the perception

27:11.420 --> 27:14.680
of you at the table, doesn't that represent the hand range?

27:14.680 --> 27:16.000
Uh-huh, absolutely.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.240
So like you can, with betting, essentially control

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
what people estimate you to have.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.400
Sure, so that makes it, so yeah, so that's true.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.440
So for example, one of the most extreme examples is,

27:26.440 --> 27:29.640
we have, there's spots where there's a bet

27:29.640 --> 27:31.920
that's considered polarizing, right?

27:31.920 --> 27:34.520
So let's say there's a thousand in the pot

27:34.520 --> 27:37.400
and you bet 10,000, which is crazy big, right?

27:37.400 --> 27:38.600
That's saying one of two things.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.400
I either have the absolute best possible hand

27:41.400 --> 27:42.720
or absolutely nothing.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.120
Because any of the hands in the middle,

27:44.120 --> 27:45.560
I wouldn't do that with.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.960
So I'm essentially telling you, when I bet that,

27:47.960 --> 27:51.200
I'm like, I either got it or I got,

27:51.200 --> 27:53.960
I don't have a mediocre hand, like just a pair of nines

27:53.960 --> 27:57.840
or a pair of tens, I have a royal flush or have nine high.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.760
So with my bet sizing, I can control how my opponent

28:01.760 --> 28:03.360
is perceiving what my range is gonna be.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.220
So for example, similarly, if I bet small, right?

28:07.220 --> 28:09.560
Well, that could be a lot of hands, right?

28:09.560 --> 28:12.160
That could represent a big part of my range.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.760
The bigger the bet, the more the narrower the range.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.240
The more polarized it is.

28:16.240 --> 28:20.600
Yeah, how far could you get without looking at your cards?

28:20.600 --> 28:22.720
Do you think, how well could you do?

28:22.720 --> 28:24.760
It depends on who I'm playing with, right?

28:24.760 --> 28:26.400
So if I was playing in a tournament

28:26.400 --> 28:28.360
with mediocre or weak players,

28:28.360 --> 28:30.640
I think I could probably do pretty well.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.480
But even like world-class.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.440
World-class, I don't think you'd have much of a chance,

28:34.440 --> 28:35.280
really, I mean.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.600
The question is trying to get at like,

28:36.600 --> 28:39.080
how important is it the actual hands you have

28:39.080 --> 28:41.920
versus the hands you're representing?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.480
Right, so that's the question of essentially,

28:43.480 --> 28:45.120
if you're not looking at your hand pre-flop,

28:45.120 --> 28:48.320
you're basically giving up a fundamental advantage, right?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.720
Where you're gonna be playing way suboptimally

28:50.720 --> 28:52.120
in terms of your hand selection, right?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.460
Because if you don't look at your hand,

28:53.460 --> 28:54.920
you might have a two and a three.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.980
That's not good, but now you're playing it.

28:56.980 --> 28:59.640
So you've invested whatever, two, 3,000 bucks

28:59.640 --> 29:01.080
with absolute garbage,

29:01.080 --> 29:03.720
and it's very difficult to climb that hill, right?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.600
So it's much better to actually look at your cards

29:05.600 --> 29:07.360
and go, okay, I'll throw away the two and three

29:07.360 --> 29:08.880
and I'll play the ace king.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.160
Speaking of garbage, you've said that 10-7

29:12.160 --> 29:13.600
is your favorite poker hand to play.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.520
Is that still the case,

29:14.520 --> 29:18.840
and what aspect of it is that you enjoy?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.560
Yeah, so it's one of those viewer discretion is advised.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.600
Like 10-7, I've just noticed throughout my life,

29:24.600 --> 29:27.280
it's a tendency thing that I've been lucky with it.

29:27.280 --> 29:28.200
So that's just sort of,

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
but it's not like I'm gonna look at 10-7 and go,

29:30.200 --> 29:33.240
oh, wow, I'm gonna call an all-in or anything like that.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.740
I'll play it in situations where it makes sense,

29:35.740 --> 29:38.240
but it's rare because it's not a very good hand.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.960
But is there some aspect of belief

29:42.960 --> 29:47.040
in the magic of this hand manifests quality of play?

29:47.040 --> 29:48.720
Or is that a little- There shouldn't be.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.720
So here's the thing, poker players,

29:50.720 --> 29:53.360
some have said it's unlucky to be superstitious,

29:53.360 --> 29:55.400
but we're all a little bit superstitious.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.360
A little bit, you know?

29:56.360 --> 29:58.280
And so, I don't know, maybe it is a case

29:58.280 --> 30:01.360
where when I have 10-7, I feel somehow energetically

30:01.360 --> 30:03.320
that I'm more likely to catch something,

30:03.320 --> 30:06.060
which may actually make me more apt to be aggressive

30:06.060 --> 30:07.760
and confident in the hand.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.080
But you really shouldn't let yourself do that.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.200
Like, you're not supposed to fall in love

30:11.200 --> 30:12.800
with any specific hands.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.800
Yeah, but, you know, uncertainty is ruthless.

30:18.240 --> 30:23.240
It's, you know, the fact that it's a game of statistics,

30:23.440 --> 30:26.920
it can be too painful for the human psychology.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.840
So maybe you have to hold on to certain superstitions.

30:30.840 --> 30:34.440
Because, you know, I mean, there's a cold absurdity

30:34.440 --> 30:37.280
to the fact that you can play extremely well

30:37.280 --> 30:38.800
and still lose.

30:38.800 --> 30:43.800
I mean, actually, this year, you've played the,

30:44.040 --> 30:47.760
what is it, 50 days of World Series of Poker.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.040
And it seems like, at least from the perspective

30:51.040 --> 30:53.080
of me looking at it through the internet,

30:53.080 --> 30:54.680
it seems like there's a lot of hands

30:54.680 --> 30:59.200
that you were like 70, 30, 80, 20, all in hands

30:59.200 --> 31:02.480
that you just were not going your way.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.280
That can sort of break you mentally.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.520
Absolutely.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.680
Yeah, one of the hardest things,

31:06.680 --> 31:07.520
especially about playing,

31:07.520 --> 31:09.600
because cash games and tournaments are different.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.120
One of the most difficult things about, you know,

31:11.120 --> 31:13.360
being a tournament player is resilience.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.800
Because more often than not, like,

31:14.800 --> 31:17.400
so if there's a tournament with a thousand people,

31:17.400 --> 31:19.400
to win the tournament, you have to get all of the chips.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.160
That means there's one winner and 999 losers.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.440
So it's very rare that you actually like win all the chips.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.200
So you're essentially at some point

31:27.200 --> 31:28.120
in every tournament you play,

31:28.120 --> 31:31.280
gonna deal with like really bad luck and disappointment.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.480
And sometimes those streaks can have you question yourself

31:34.480 --> 31:35.960
and be introspective about, okay,

31:35.960 --> 31:37.960
so I think I'm 47 now,

31:37.960 --> 31:40.160
I think I've gotten better as time went on

31:40.160 --> 31:42.080
between distinguishing, okay,

31:42.080 --> 31:44.680
am I losing right now because of bad luck?

31:44.680 --> 31:46.200
Or is it fundamentally,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.760
decisions I'm making are not very good, right?

31:48.760 --> 31:50.160
And that's one of the hardest things

31:50.160 --> 31:53.240
for anyone who plays poker to get to, right?

31:53.240 --> 31:54.280
Why am I losing?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.240
Am I losing because of my opponents being better,

31:57.240 --> 31:58.080
I'm not playing well,

31:58.080 --> 31:59.400
or am I losing just because of luck?

31:59.400 --> 32:02.560
And because there's so much variance in poker,

32:02.560 --> 32:06.000
a lot of players can be confused on both sides of the coin.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.680
One guy's winning and he thinks he's great,

32:07.680 --> 32:08.640
he's really not.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.000
Wait till the cards break even as we say.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.480
I think there's a lot of parallels to life as well.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.600
If you get screwed over and over,

32:15.600 --> 32:17.960
it's hard to know if you're doing something wrong

32:17.960 --> 32:19.920
or if it's just bad luck.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.960
I think they did a study,

32:20.960 --> 32:22.040
I remember there was like a study,

32:22.040 --> 32:23.880
it was supposed to be related to gambling,

32:23.880 --> 32:26.000
but it was mice and they put them in a little maze

32:26.000 --> 32:27.920
and they go down these three tubes

32:27.920 --> 32:30.880
and they go down this one tube and there'd be cheese, right?

32:30.920 --> 32:32.800
And then they go down again, cheese.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.040
Three times in a row there was cheese there, right?

32:35.040 --> 32:38.160
The next time there was an electric shock there, not cheese.

32:39.520 --> 32:44.080
The mouse went to get zapped, he got zapped, okay?

32:44.080 --> 32:47.440
Came back, he kept going back to get zapped until he died.

32:47.440 --> 32:50.560
Like he kept going because he found cheese there.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.120
He has won there.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.800
So he continued to go chase that win,

32:54.800 --> 32:58.240
despite it being now all of a sudden not worthwhile

32:58.240 --> 32:59.360
till they died.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.320
And essentially what they said was

33:01.320 --> 33:03.400
that is essentially how they compared it

33:03.400 --> 33:05.040
to like the gambling brain

33:05.040 --> 33:06.800
and how people think about gambling.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.200
You're chasing the wins.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.920
You learn too much,

33:09.920 --> 33:12.440
you sort of overgeneralize the lessons learned

33:12.440 --> 33:13.680
from the times you've won.

33:13.680 --> 33:15.640
Yeah, like beginner's luck can be detrimental.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.480
If you have some early luck

33:17.480 --> 33:18.760
and you believe that this is just the way

33:18.760 --> 33:21.080
it's supposed to be forever,

33:21.080 --> 33:23.520
it can put you in a delusional state

33:23.520 --> 33:26.520
where you feel like I'm just great,

33:26.520 --> 33:28.800
but no, you're not, you were just lucky in the beginning.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.480
I actually played poker once in Vegas.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.080
It was a, it wasn't a tournament,

33:34.080 --> 33:37.920
but it was a kind of tournament-like style.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.120
I already forgot what it was,

33:39.120 --> 33:43.000
but what I do remember is I had four of a kind.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.280
So the last hand I've ever played in poker

33:46.280 --> 33:47.760
was I got a four of a kind,

33:47.760 --> 33:51.520
and there was a couple of others with really strong hands,

33:51.520 --> 33:53.160
so everybody went all in.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.600
And I think you get some kind of bonus

33:54.600 --> 33:55.560
for getting four of a kind.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.880
Bad beat jackpot you were playing.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.520
Yeah, so something like this.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.400
I apologize if I don't know the details,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.320
but I just remember winning a lot of money

34:02.320 --> 34:04.080
and I walked away from the table.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.280
I said, I'm not playing poker again.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.080
This is great, I'm gonna, up top,

34:07.080 --> 34:09.360
because I started to feel like this is your,

34:09.360 --> 34:10.200
I started to think,

34:10.200 --> 34:12.200
even though I haven't really played poker at all,

34:12.200 --> 34:15.440
that I'm good, and that was a really dangerous feeling.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.600
And everybody was really mad

34:16.600 --> 34:18.160
for walking away from the table.

34:18.160 --> 34:19.200
One of the other things that I think

34:19.200 --> 34:21.960
is interesting about poker too is good is relative, right?

34:21.960 --> 34:25.200
So you could be the seventh best player in the whole world,

34:25.200 --> 34:26.920
like literally seventh best player,

34:26.920 --> 34:29.480
but if you're playing with the other six,

34:29.480 --> 34:30.960
you're the sucker.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.840
You are the worst player in the game, right?

34:33.840 --> 34:36.600
So there's a lot of players, for example,

34:36.600 --> 34:38.440
like the Dan Blazarians of the world, right?

34:38.440 --> 34:40.600
He's not a top level player,

34:40.600 --> 34:42.480
like these guys you see on TV,

34:42.480 --> 34:44.640
but he probably makes more money than they do

34:44.640 --> 34:46.040
because he plays with people

34:46.040 --> 34:47.680
that are far below his skill level.

34:47.680 --> 34:50.240
So part of the skill of being a poker player

34:50.240 --> 34:53.600
is finding situations where you're profitable,

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
regardless of your skill level.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.920
Another connection to life.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.160
You think Dan Blazarian is telling the truth

35:01.160 --> 35:04.720
about having made, what is it, 50, 100 million dollars,

35:04.720 --> 35:06.840
just a huge amount of money playing poker?

35:06.840 --> 35:09.400
Considering what I know about the private games

35:09.400 --> 35:11.400
and the types of players who play in these private games

35:11.400 --> 35:12.760
and the stakes that they play,

35:12.760 --> 35:14.920
I absolutely believe Dan has made,

35:14.920 --> 35:16.160
I don't know how many millions,

35:16.160 --> 35:17.800
but whether it's 50, whatever,

35:17.800 --> 35:21.000
but it wouldn't surprise me that if you play in these games

35:21.000 --> 35:23.920
within a year or you find the right businessman

35:23.920 --> 35:26.160
who has way too much Bitcoin money,

35:26.160 --> 35:28.320
and in one night you take him for 20 million,

35:28.320 --> 35:29.680
I absolutely could see it.

35:29.680 --> 35:30.960
I don't see any reason why.

35:30.960 --> 35:33.040
Listen, where he got his money initially,

35:33.040 --> 35:36.560
that's up to interpretation from his father or whatever,

35:36.560 --> 35:38.960
but has he made a bunch of money playing poker?

35:38.960 --> 35:40.640
Absolutely, no question.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.160
Do you feel, as somebody who loves the game,

35:43.160 --> 35:46.320
do you think there's something almost ethically wrong

35:46.320 --> 35:48.800
in playing people much worse than you?

35:48.800 --> 35:50.200
So yeah, that's a good question

35:50.200 --> 35:53.520
because part of the reason I played poker

35:53.520 --> 35:54.600
and wanted to become professional

35:54.600 --> 35:57.160
was I wanted to make my mother proud, right?

35:57.160 --> 35:58.520
And I don't think she would be proud of me

35:58.520 --> 36:03.040
taking Grandma Betty's last $5 and down the street,

36:03.040 --> 36:05.240
sending her broke and taking her pension check.

36:05.240 --> 36:06.480
So I play at the highest stakes

36:06.480 --> 36:07.800
against people who can afford it.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.640
They know who I am.

36:08.640 --> 36:09.480
I'm not a hustler.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.560
I'm not pretending I'm bad at poker to squeeze in.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.920
I was thinking about this just yesterday

36:13.920 --> 36:15.040
because I played in a game

36:15.040 --> 36:17.920
that if I played that sort of role

36:17.920 --> 36:19.240
where a lot of guys do pros

36:19.240 --> 36:21.640
that sort of play down their skill level,

36:21.640 --> 36:23.400
pretend they're just one of the guys,

36:24.280 --> 36:26.640
these guys can make $20, $30 million in a year,

36:26.640 --> 36:27.560
legitimately.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.520
Like I believe that like, if I did that,

36:29.520 --> 36:31.600
if I said, you know what, I'm gonna go down that path,

36:31.600 --> 36:33.120
get into these games in LA, you know,

36:33.120 --> 36:34.520
and travel and do all this kind of stuff,

36:34.520 --> 36:35.680
I can make 20 million a year.

36:35.680 --> 36:38.120
But it feels a little greasy, right?

36:38.120 --> 36:39.640
I don't like to kiss anyone's ass.

36:39.640 --> 36:43.360
I don't like to ask anyone for a favor or things like that.

36:43.360 --> 36:48.360
So, but yeah, like I feel, listen,

36:48.760 --> 36:51.200
a rich guy who wants to sit down with a million bucks

36:51.200 --> 36:52.040
and get drunk and lose it,

36:52.040 --> 36:53.200
I have no empathy for that.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.640
I'm like, I don't have any moral qualms with that.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.960
So if grandma Betty is a billionaire.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.160
Send it, send it, right?

37:01.160 --> 37:03.200
You know, absolutely, why not?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.880
Well, let me ask you about a tough period

37:06.880 --> 37:08.000
of your recent life.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.080
You had a rough, like we mentioned,

37:10.080 --> 37:15.080
the World Series of Poker losing $1.1 million over 48 days.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.440
What were you going through mentally during that?

37:18.440 --> 37:20.280
So here's the thing, you know, I do, like you said,

37:20.280 --> 37:21.520
I do a YouTube vlog every day.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.800
So I kind of share my thoughts and listen,

37:23.800 --> 37:26.720
I can edit that thing and keep out the bad stuff,

37:26.720 --> 37:29.800
but I think it's more authentic and genuine to show people

37:29.800 --> 37:32.000
the actual struggles and the pain that I go through,

37:32.000 --> 37:32.840
you know, without it.

37:32.840 --> 37:35.000
And I'd say the one thing I'm most proud of

37:35.000 --> 37:36.600
throughout the entire thing is the resilience.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.960
Because there are moments you see me where I'm broken.

37:38.960 --> 37:39.960
I'm just like, I can't take it.

37:39.960 --> 37:41.680
I broke a selfie stick this year.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.200
Like I was filming it because, you know,

37:43.200 --> 37:44.800
I do for my vlog, I smashed the stick,

37:44.800 --> 37:46.240
threw it in the corner, right?

37:46.240 --> 37:49.200
It's just, that was my like hit rock bottom moment.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.200
And then I put the camera on me and I was like, all right,

37:51.200 --> 37:52.320
I'll let people see it.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.840
But mentally it was very difficult

37:53.840 --> 37:58.840
because there was a feeling of hopelessness where you can,

37:58.840 --> 37:59.960
I was making good decisions.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.640
Like I genuinely felt like I'm playing really, really well.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.120
But every time my money went in,

38:04.120 --> 38:08.080
my opponent's money went in and say I was 60%, 70%, 80%

38:08.080 --> 38:11.440
for about a two week stretch, I lost every one of those.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.440
And you start to wonder, you're like,

38:13.440 --> 38:16.880
I can't win if I never win, you know, in these spots.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.240
So it was difficult.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.960
Luckily I have, you know, 20 odd years of experience

38:20.960 --> 38:22.000
on how to deal with it.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.040
And so, as I said, I wake up the next day, ready to go.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.920
So as if nothing happened.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.960
To a certain degree, obviously, you know,

38:29.960 --> 38:32.160
the more it happens in the higher vines,

38:32.160 --> 38:34.000
like the one where I broke the selfie stick,

38:34.000 --> 38:37.040
I lost 500,000 in that tournament, right?

38:37.040 --> 38:39.000
And it was like the last card, it was painful.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.280
I think you lost.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.040
Yeah, that was great, that video.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.000
I think he lost 53.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.560
What led up to the selfie stick gate?

38:48.360 --> 38:53.360
You just lost your shit for like 100 milliseconds.

38:53.800 --> 38:54.640
Yeah.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.480
Like it was very brief.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.320
You're just like, what, the world wasn't making any sense?

38:58.320 --> 39:01.160
Like how do I keep losing kind of thing?

39:01.160 --> 39:02.440
Why did you lose your shit?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.720
You should never really think like this,

39:03.720 --> 39:06.960
but part of me felt like I deserve to win this, right?

39:06.960 --> 39:07.800
So part of me was like, listen,

39:07.800 --> 39:10.120
I've lost so many in the last two weeks, all right.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.640
Let, you know, the poker gods be kind to me right now.

39:12.640 --> 39:13.480
Let me win this.

39:13.480 --> 39:14.400
And it looked good.

39:14.400 --> 39:17.120
I was in a great situation on the flop,

39:17.160 --> 39:18.280
great situation on the turn.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.040
I'm about to be a competitor.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.920
I'm going to be a contender in this tournament

39:21.920 --> 39:24.640
to win a big prize pool and turn the whole thing around.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.480
It's all there for the taking.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.400
And then boom, the last card, it just, you know,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.560
it was a couple of weeks of frustration

39:31.560 --> 39:33.840
in the moment of filming that I just had, you know,

39:33.840 --> 39:35.560
sort of a visceral reaction, you know,

39:35.560 --> 39:37.800
and I smacked the selfie stick.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.400
And then like, I see a corner, it's safe.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.920
I threw the selfie stick on the ground.

39:41.920 --> 39:45.200
And of course social media blows up about how, you know,

39:45.200 --> 39:46.880
it was a violent act.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.360
I mean, it's like, have you never watched sports?

39:49.360 --> 39:51.360
Have you never seen a guy on the golf course

39:51.360 --> 39:53.360
smack his club or throw their helmet?

39:53.360 --> 39:55.040
Like, you know, there was the,

39:55.040 --> 39:57.320
there's a guy, Justin Bonomo is a poker player

39:57.320 --> 40:00.560
and he's super, for lack of a better word,

40:00.560 --> 40:02.000
offended by everything.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.680
And he was equating my throwing a stick on the ground

40:04.680 --> 40:07.480
to violence against women, domestic abuse,

40:07.480 --> 40:09.120
and the idea that like,

40:09.120 --> 40:12.000
this makes women feel unsafe to play poker.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.440
And so that was kind of a running joke

40:13.440 --> 40:15.760
for the last two weeks where every time I sat at a table,

40:15.760 --> 40:19.320
the guys would be like, oh, I feel unsafe, I feel unsafe.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.720
Yeah, can you take me through the hand?

40:20.720 --> 40:21.760
Do you remember what the hand was?

40:21.760 --> 40:22.680
Like, what was the-

40:22.680 --> 40:23.920
Yeah, so it was a, you know,

40:23.920 --> 40:25.680
the player on the button raised.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.480
David Peters, very aggressive player.

40:27.480 --> 40:29.040
He went all in from the blind

40:29.040 --> 40:31.080
and I had a pair of pocket 10s.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.120
So I went with my 10s and he had queen 10 of spades.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.360
So I was good.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.040
I have way the best hand.

40:37.040 --> 40:40.080
And the flop was like king nine, three, one spade.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.440
Turn was like the eight of spades.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.200
So now he has a flush draw and the river was another spade.

40:45.200 --> 40:47.720
So he caught spade, spade and he made a flush.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.640
Wow, but statistically you were winning the whole time.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.280
Yeah, I was winning up until the last card.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.840
What did he go all in on?

40:53.840 --> 40:54.880
Was it a bluff?

40:54.880 --> 40:57.120
He made what's considered like a pretty standard play

40:57.120 --> 40:59.520
in modern poker where, you know, a guy raised

40:59.520 --> 41:01.480
and he was just trying to pick up, you know, what was there.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.480
And he ran into a hand in the big blind and you know,

41:03.480 --> 41:04.400
he got lucky.

41:04.400 --> 41:08.440
So what was the throughout the strategy of preparation,

41:08.440 --> 41:09.800
the strategy of play?

41:09.800 --> 41:12.560
So you're playing so many days.

41:12.560 --> 41:14.360
Are you trying to ignore the results

41:14.360 --> 41:16.880
and stick to a particular strategy?

41:16.880 --> 41:20.440
Yes, for the most part, you know, what I'm trying to do

41:20.440 --> 41:23.280
is like, if I formulate a strategy for the whole seven weeks

41:23.280 --> 41:25.960
because there's a varying degree of buy-ins too.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.320
Like you have small ones, like 1500,

41:28.320 --> 41:30.200
then you've got like $250,000 buy-in.

41:30.200 --> 41:33.440
So I map out the seven weeks and write,

41:33.440 --> 41:36.360
I'll give little bit of mental energy to the 1500,

41:36.360 --> 41:37.920
which means I'll be on my phone.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.000
I don't care as much about this one, but the 250K,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.800
fully engaged, fully focused, you know,

41:43.800 --> 41:46.120
up against obviously the higher the buy-in, you know,

41:46.120 --> 41:48.200
super top competition.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.920
And you know, as far as strategy goes,

41:50.920 --> 41:53.920
focusing on each day, playing the best I can,

41:53.920 --> 41:55.560
not the result.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.240
Like, cause if you focus on the result,

41:57.240 --> 41:58.640
you're focused in the wrong place.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.960
Your focus should be on the decisions you actually make.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.800
Right?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.600
And if you're making good decisions consistently,

42:04.600 --> 42:05.680
you have to continue to do that.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.480
The frustrating part is this with poker,

42:07.480 --> 42:09.040
unlike chess or other things,

42:09.040 --> 42:12.400
making the best possible decision doesn't mean you win.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.480
Often you lose.

42:13.480 --> 42:14.560
You don't, chess.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.000
Well, Magnus Carlsen has also talked about that.

42:20.840 --> 42:25.240
There's some non-deterministic thing about chess too,

42:25.240 --> 42:30.240
given the limited cognitive capacity of the human mind.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.440
So he says that the world championship

42:32.440 --> 42:34.600
should have 20, 30, 40, 50 games,

42:34.600 --> 42:36.640
not the few that they have.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.280
It's too low of a sample.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.960
So in that sense, the high stakes poker tournaments

42:41.960 --> 42:44.240
are very too low sample.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.320
Sure. Yeah.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.200
Well, when you think of the world series of poker,

42:47.200 --> 42:49.800
so as you said, I lost about 1 million, right?

42:49.800 --> 42:52.280
In one tournament, that was 500,000.

42:52.280 --> 42:53.800
So then, you know, like a few others here

42:53.800 --> 42:54.640
of high buy-in tournaments.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.680
So the sample or the amount was, you know,

42:57.680 --> 43:00.520
40, 50 total tournaments with, you know, high variants.

43:00.520 --> 43:03.280
And if you don't run well or do well in the highest buy-ins,

43:03.280 --> 43:06.040
you know, you're going to have a losing summer.

43:06.040 --> 43:09.040
So you did a podcast on the mental game a few years ago,

43:09.040 --> 43:10.640
that's just something you really care about.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.040
So what aspects of the mental game in poker

43:13.040 --> 43:15.320
is most difficult to master?

43:15.320 --> 43:16.920
I think the most difficult thing for people

43:16.920 --> 43:18.880
is self-awareness, right?

43:18.880 --> 43:19.920
And resilience.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.800
Self-awareness to know, okay, so, you know, again,

43:22.800 --> 43:25.360
is it, am I not doing as well as I could be

43:25.360 --> 43:28.040
because of luck or is there things that I can learn?

43:28.040 --> 43:30.200
And I always look to mistakes as opportunities.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.280
I really do.

43:31.280 --> 43:34.120
When I make a mistake in a poker hand, right,

43:34.120 --> 43:36.320
call it a breakdown or whatever,

43:36.320 --> 43:38.200
that's where breakthroughs happen.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.920
I'm like, oh, you know what I could have done here?

43:40.920 --> 43:43.640
I could have done this and that would have been really good

43:43.640 --> 43:44.880
and I'm going to do that going forward.

43:44.880 --> 43:48.080
So I think like with anything, you know,

43:48.080 --> 43:50.040
when you start out playing golf,

43:50.040 --> 43:52.840
like your goal is to just hit the ball, right?

43:52.840 --> 43:54.760
Then you try to hit it near,

43:54.760 --> 43:56.200
then you're trying to hit it straight,

43:56.200 --> 43:58.000
then you're trying to hit it on the green,

43:58.000 --> 43:59.240
then you're trying to hit it closer to the green

43:59.240 --> 44:02.200
to the point where the pros get where, you know,

44:02.200 --> 44:05.160
they're so finite, they're trying to hit it 63 yards

44:05.160 --> 44:06.920
and spin it back three yards.

44:07.360 --> 44:10.320
It's imperfect, like they don't hit the perfect shot

44:10.320 --> 44:12.840
because the perfect shot for them is it goes in,

44:12.840 --> 44:14.560
but they try and make the mistakes smaller

44:14.560 --> 44:15.560
and smaller and smaller.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.080
Poker's the same.

44:17.080 --> 44:19.200
We all make mistakes consistently.

44:19.200 --> 44:21.920
The goal is to minimize, especially the big ones.

44:23.160 --> 44:26.360
What was the lowest point for you psychologically

44:27.520 --> 44:28.920
in poker in general, actually?

44:28.920 --> 44:31.240
Maybe it was this year, maybe it was in general.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.360
Do you remember there was times in your life,

44:33.360 --> 44:34.880
speaking of resilience,

44:34.880 --> 44:37.680
that were extremely difficult to you mentally?

44:37.680 --> 44:41.280
Yeah, so early on, you know, as basically as a teenager,

44:41.280 --> 44:43.120
I was playing Toronto, and then in my early 20s,

44:43.120 --> 44:44.800
I'm like, I'm going to Vegas, right?

44:44.800 --> 44:46.360
And I thought I was the best.

44:46.360 --> 44:49.640
I'm like 21 years old, I'm like, check me out, right?

44:49.640 --> 44:54.640
Show up with $3,000, 24 hours later, you know, money's gone.

44:54.960 --> 44:58.400
And I remember the moment vividly.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.400
It was at the Binion's Horseshoe,

44:59.400 --> 45:00.600
it was about three in the morning.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.760
I was playing with seven other people.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.600
You know, I lost my last chips.

45:04.600 --> 45:09.560
I went to the bathroom, washed up, got out, they all left.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.160
And it was like a moment where I realized like,

45:11.160 --> 45:12.920
okay, in Toronto, I was the big fish.

45:12.920 --> 45:15.200
But here, they were playing because of me.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.240
I was the sucker.

45:16.240 --> 45:18.000
I remembered every one of their faces.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.520
And then I remember not having enough money

45:19.520 --> 45:22.120
to get back to budget suites where I was staying.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.040
So I walked, you know, I walked.

45:25.040 --> 45:26.520
And in that moment, I was thinking about like,

45:26.520 --> 45:28.040
is this something that I'll be able to do?

45:28.040 --> 45:29.360
Am I good enough?

45:29.360 --> 45:30.760
You know, what am I going to do now?

45:30.760 --> 45:32.360
I'm in Vegas, I don't know anybody,

45:32.360 --> 45:34.560
and I have no money, right?

45:35.520 --> 45:37.720
So that was certainly like what felt like a low point,

45:37.720 --> 45:40.200
walking back behind Paradise and Twain,

45:40.200 --> 45:41.960
which is not a great part of town.

45:43.120 --> 45:46.320
Where did you find the strength to answer yes

45:46.320 --> 45:48.960
to that question that you can still do good?

45:48.960 --> 45:51.120
I think this has been sort of a pattern in my life

45:51.120 --> 45:53.640
where like in the evening after it happens,

45:53.640 --> 45:54.840
like I don't have it.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.880
You know, I don't have that feeling of hope

45:56.880 --> 45:59.440
or, you know, resilience, if you will.

45:59.440 --> 46:02.560
I'm allowing myself to experience despair,

46:02.560 --> 46:04.320
which is exactly where I'm at.

46:04.320 --> 46:05.800
But then a good night's sleep,

46:05.800 --> 46:08.440
wake up the next morning and just within me,

46:08.440 --> 46:10.840
I have that inner confidence to say, you know what?

46:10.840 --> 46:13.200
Fuck it, get back on the hobby horse,

46:13.200 --> 46:15.920
find a way, make it work, right?

46:15.920 --> 46:18.320
But I do believe it's really therapeutic

46:18.320 --> 46:21.800
and worthwhile to allow yourself to feel and vent.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.240
So many people today,

46:23.240 --> 46:25.040
the Instagram culture world I call it,

46:25.040 --> 46:26.840
it's like they want to act like they're perfect.

46:26.840 --> 46:28.920
Nothing bothers them, bullshit, right?

46:28.920 --> 46:30.560
You're pissed off, it's okay to show it.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.280
Emotion's fine, we all have it.

46:32.280 --> 46:34.200
There's no reason you have to suppress it.

46:35.080 --> 46:35.920
Obviously you don't want to have guys

46:35.920 --> 46:36.960
throwing selfie sticks around the room

46:36.960 --> 46:38.840
every time they lose a pot, right?

46:38.840 --> 46:39.680
Yeah.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.880
But, you know, a little bit of-

46:40.880 --> 46:42.480
You're gonna make everybody feel unsafe.

46:42.480 --> 46:43.320
Yeah, exactly.

46:43.320 --> 46:44.160
If that happens.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.000
Yeah.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.760
So you're saying, there is a culture of saying,

46:46.760 --> 46:48.440
you know, stay positive, all this kind of stuff,

46:48.440 --> 46:50.720
but, you know, when you feel despair,

46:50.720 --> 46:52.960
don't resist it, ride it out.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.880
Because it doesn't go away, right?

46:54.880 --> 46:56.320
That feeling, you know, you think you put it away

46:56.320 --> 46:57.800
in the pit of your stomach and you think, you know,

46:57.800 --> 46:59.520
it's gone, it's not, it's still there.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.000
Let yourself go, fuck!

47:01.000 --> 47:01.840
Yeah.

47:01.840 --> 47:02.800
You know, it's all right.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.800
You know, there's nothing wrong

47:04.800 --> 47:05.760
with being a little bit emotional,

47:05.760 --> 47:07.160
because once you've experienced it,

47:07.160 --> 47:10.160
you let it out, now you can move past it.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.000
Yeah.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.760
And I feel like as long as your brain chemistry

47:12.760 --> 47:17.440
can support it, you can usually learn a good lesson from it.

47:17.440 --> 47:18.680
Like you become stronger,

47:18.680 --> 47:20.360
you become more resilient through it.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.320
It's really interesting.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.120
And a good night's sleep can really help.

47:23.120 --> 47:24.720
Absolutely, yeah.

47:24.720 --> 47:28.440
So through 2022, and in general,

47:28.440 --> 47:30.280
what is a perfect day in the life of

47:30.280 --> 47:32.840
Daniel Negrano look like when you're,

47:32.840 --> 47:36.200
like on a day when you have to play a big game,

47:36.200 --> 47:37.640
big tournament game and so on?

47:37.640 --> 47:39.840
So like, what time do you wake up?

47:39.840 --> 47:41.240
What do you eat for breakfast?

47:41.240 --> 47:43.720
So my life is twofold.

47:43.720 --> 47:46.000
Like one, when I'm playing, hardcore,

47:46.000 --> 47:47.400
and one when I'm not.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.360
And they look very different, right?

47:49.360 --> 47:51.880
So I'll give you a quick glimpse of like when I'm not,

47:51.880 --> 47:55.840
up at 10, you know, breakfast, in the gym at noon,

47:55.840 --> 48:00.840
you know, post-workout, meal, coffee, walk.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.960
Like, you know, I try to get, that's what I do for cardio.

48:05.960 --> 48:07.400
You know, and just very like home-bodied.

48:07.400 --> 48:08.320
I don't leave the house.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.720
It's very like boring and mundane, right?

48:10.720 --> 48:11.600
Long distance walk.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.120
So like, what do you do when you're walking?

48:13.120 --> 48:14.120
You're thinking about stuff?

48:14.120 --> 48:15.800
Well, no, honestly, I just walk on the treadmill.

48:15.800 --> 48:18.040
I try to get 15,000 steps a day.

48:18.040 --> 48:19.760
And I just walk for basically like an hour

48:19.760 --> 48:21.640
while I watch a show or I'm on the computer

48:21.640 --> 48:22.480
or something like that.

48:22.480 --> 48:23.480
You know, I'm on the treadmill.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.640
Why walking, not running?

48:25.640 --> 48:27.400
Well, I mean, I think walking,

48:27.400 --> 48:29.400
I mean, I do a little bit of running, but hardly any.

48:29.400 --> 48:30.680
I don't enjoy it.

48:30.680 --> 48:31.920
Like, I just like walking.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.640
And frankly, for fat loss, when it's usually what I'm doing

48:34.640 --> 48:37.920
after big poker tournaments is getting back in shape,

48:37.920 --> 48:40.160
that walking is ideal for it, right?

48:40.160 --> 48:41.680
So essentially it's like the tale of two.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.600
During the World Series of Poker,

48:43.600 --> 48:47.760
all my sort of structured life thrown out the window.

48:47.760 --> 48:48.880
There's no walking.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.160
There's very little walking.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.360
There's very little working out.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.200
There's very little anything.

48:52.200 --> 48:54.160
I go into the World Series, you know,

48:54.160 --> 48:57.440
like this year I went in around 157

48:57.440 --> 48:59.440
and I expected to gain about 10 pounds

48:59.440 --> 49:00.280
during the World Series.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.920
Not good pounds, it wasn't muscle,

49:01.920 --> 49:03.720
but that's about what I did, 165.

49:03.720 --> 49:06.600
And then I spend the next month trying to lose it.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.520
But during the World Series, when I'm playing,

49:08.520 --> 49:10.840
the most important thing without question

49:10.840 --> 49:12.040
that I have to focus on,

49:12.040 --> 49:13.960
and this is why I stopped focusing

49:13.960 --> 49:16.440
on working out and all this stuff is sleep.

49:16.440 --> 49:18.360
If I'm not rested, I'm useless.

49:18.360 --> 49:20.360
If I only get five, six hours

49:20.360 --> 49:23.480
and I have to go back the next day and play 14 hours,

49:23.520 --> 49:26.480
the chances of me being at my best, very, very slim.

49:26.480 --> 49:27.440
So sleep is a priority.

49:27.440 --> 49:30.080
What's the perfect amount of sleep for you on those days?

49:30.080 --> 49:30.920
Eight, seven?

49:30.920 --> 49:33.960
So eight hours is my go-to every night.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.560
During the World Series of Poker, it's just not possible.

49:36.560 --> 49:37.920
Because of the way that it's structured,

49:37.920 --> 49:40.960
sometimes the tournaments end at 2.15 a.m.

49:40.960 --> 49:44.360
I get home about three o'clock.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.920
Takes me 30 minutes, 40 minutes to get to sleep.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.800
So now let's say I'm in bed by four.

49:48.800 --> 49:51.640
Well, the tournament's at, you know, two.

49:51.680 --> 49:53.560
So I have to get up and whatever.

49:53.560 --> 49:55.120
So it's very difficult to get exactly eight

49:55.120 --> 49:56.320
a lot of the time, you know,

49:56.320 --> 49:57.680
and also get back there in time.

49:57.680 --> 50:01.400
Is there any hacks to quiet the mind?

50:01.400 --> 50:04.600
Because you're going on a pretty intense rollercoaster

50:04.600 --> 50:06.560
mentally when you're playing.

50:07.840 --> 50:10.800
Is there any tricks to getting to sleep given the rollercoaster?

50:10.800 --> 50:12.120
I've been very lucky.

50:12.120 --> 50:12.960
Like I'm blessed.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.760
I don't know if it's because of the diet or what,

50:14.760 --> 50:16.720
but I've always been a very good sleeper.

50:16.720 --> 50:17.640
You just shut off.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.040
I get to sleep and I sleep like a baby, you know?

50:20.040 --> 50:21.880
And I also nap really well.

50:21.880 --> 50:22.880
Like during the World Series,

50:22.880 --> 50:24.720
sometimes what will happen is let's say I get knocked out

50:24.720 --> 50:26.360
of one event at 4 p.m.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.480
and there's another one that I can jump in.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.120
Instead of jumping right into it,

50:30.120 --> 50:34.240
I'll go into like a private room and take 45 minute nap

50:34.240 --> 50:36.960
and, you know, and give me enough energy to continue

50:36.960 --> 50:38.280
and sort of reset my mind.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.080
Yeah, and it solves a lot of problems with the nap too.

50:41.080 --> 50:41.920
It does. Yeah.

50:41.920 --> 50:46.200
I feel like the nap is a magical trick in life.

50:46.200 --> 50:47.520
What else diet wise?

50:47.520 --> 50:52.240
What do you, your mind is going, you know,

50:52.240 --> 50:54.000
pretty intensely all day.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.880
Yeah, so during like, like I said,

50:55.880 --> 50:58.760
when I'm not playing, I'm super regimented.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.760
You know, I have, I literally measure everything.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.440
You know, I count calories.

51:03.440 --> 51:04.440
I count macros.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.880
I follow it to a T.

51:05.880 --> 51:07.520
Pretty balanced diet or any?

51:07.520 --> 51:08.360
I'm a vegan.

51:08.360 --> 51:09.200
Vegan, yeah.

51:09.200 --> 51:10.560
So it's, you know, a vegan diet, like.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.160
But balanced in terms of carbs and-

51:12.160 --> 51:13.000
Yeah, yeah.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.000
I mean, I eat a healthy amount.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.800
I'm doing probably 150 grams of protein

51:17.840 --> 51:20.160
like 60 grams of fat, 50, and then about-

51:20.160 --> 51:21.480
And try to measure it all out.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.320
I do, yeah.

51:22.320 --> 51:23.480
Basically I created a meal plan.

51:23.480 --> 51:24.760
So what I did for myself is

51:24.760 --> 51:26.800
cause I'm really anal and I made a spreadsheet

51:26.800 --> 51:29.720
with like a day's food and I have six different ones.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.000
So I just follow it.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.600
Like I don't, it actually makes my life so much easier

51:34.600 --> 51:35.440
when I don't have to think about

51:35.440 --> 51:37.120
what I'm gonna eat for lunch or what I'm gonna eat for dinner.

51:37.120 --> 51:38.120
I already know what I'm gonna eat.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.320
I already wrote it down and it doesn't get boring

51:40.320 --> 51:42.520
because I'm switching it up every day, you know,

51:42.520 --> 51:45.200
every six days and again, occasionally I'll, you know,

51:45.200 --> 51:46.320
splurge or do something different.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.920
During the World Series of Poker,

51:47.920 --> 51:49.640
I eat whatever the fuck I wanna eat.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.480
Yeah.

51:50.480 --> 51:54.960
Like at 2 a.m., I don't crave like a broccoli carrot salad.

51:54.960 --> 51:58.680
Like I want chocolate, candy, and chips.

51:58.680 --> 51:59.520
So I'll just do it.

51:59.520 --> 52:01.400
So you listen to the cravings.

52:01.400 --> 52:02.960
Yeah, I realize like-

52:02.960 --> 52:05.360
Surprising because like you're so regimented

52:05.360 --> 52:06.640
outside of that.

52:06.640 --> 52:07.760
It's really difficult.

52:07.760 --> 52:08.880
Like I've done it before

52:08.880 --> 52:10.440
where I played the World Series of Poker

52:10.440 --> 52:13.160
and I made it a point to work out every day.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.440
But what that did was it sacrificed sleep.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.280
Yeah.

52:17.240 --> 52:18.800
And I found like at 1 a.m., I would be more tired,

52:18.800 --> 52:20.680
you know, because I've expended more energy

52:20.680 --> 52:21.520
than I would otherwise.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.760
So I essentially like look at the World Series

52:23.760 --> 52:26.360
is six, seven weeks where my body's just gonna take a beating

52:26.360 --> 52:29.440
not like UFC fighter, but like a different kind of beating.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.640
And that's okay because I have so much confidence

52:31.640 --> 52:35.000
that within six weeks of just like eating right

52:35.000 --> 52:36.840
and working out, I can get back to where I was.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.160
Which is hilarious to me that you'd be eating chocolate.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.120
What eating chocolate in bed as you're trying to get to sleep

52:42.120 --> 52:42.960
is this-

52:42.960 --> 52:45.240
Like literally a bag of like chips or chocolate.

52:45.240 --> 52:46.080
Yeah.

52:46.880 --> 52:48.560
And I'm on my way home and before bed, you know,

52:48.560 --> 52:49.400
just whatever.

52:49.400 --> 52:51.400
This is what the professional athlete does

52:51.400 --> 52:54.160
at the highest, most difficult event of his career.

52:54.160 --> 52:58.680
Okay, so what else is there in terms of mental preparation

52:58.680 --> 53:01.480
and focus and meditation, those kinds of things

53:01.480 --> 53:03.200
leading up to the games?

53:03.200 --> 53:05.360
Is there anything you like to,

53:05.360 --> 53:07.960
like any rituals you like to follow?

53:07.960 --> 53:10.160
So yeah, I have dabbled in the past

53:10.160 --> 53:11.800
with like meditation and different things like that.

53:11.800 --> 53:13.600
And I know that there's health benefits to it.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.400
And I understand that a lot of people get a lot from it

53:16.400 --> 53:18.560
and I've done it for good amount of time,

53:18.560 --> 53:20.360
like long periods of time.

53:20.360 --> 53:23.800
I found that for me, I think it was predominantly placebo.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.440
Like it really wasn't doing anything for me

53:26.440 --> 53:28.600
that I felt like it was, it felt like I was doing something,

53:28.600 --> 53:31.880
but I really, I didn't see any specific results from it.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.040
So I don't really do that too much.

53:34.040 --> 53:37.360
One thing that I will do for me is leading up,

53:37.360 --> 53:39.280
is there's so much footage now

53:39.280 --> 53:42.280
that I'll make it a point to like watch my opponents.

53:42.280 --> 53:45.640
And then with like my phone, I'll take notes

53:45.640 --> 53:48.000
and I'll keep track of different things that I'm seeing.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.520
And that sort of, and then what I'll do

53:49.520 --> 53:50.960
is I'll formulate a game plan.

53:50.960 --> 53:52.960
Like I'm playing the Poker Masters coming up

53:52.960 --> 53:54.120
in about a week.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.920
And I'll look to see the tendencies

53:55.920 --> 53:56.800
of what my opponents are doing.

53:56.800 --> 53:58.560
And then I'll come up with like some things

53:58.560 --> 54:00.520
that I'm gonna do, some tricks of the trade, if you will.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.400
Not game theory optimal stuff,

54:02.400 --> 54:04.600
stuff that I think, oh, they're making a mistake here

54:04.600 --> 54:05.920
that I can exploit.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.920
And then I look to do that in different ways

54:07.920 --> 54:11.720
and always look to, you know, throw curve balls.

54:11.760 --> 54:14.280
How hard is that, that process?

54:14.280 --> 54:16.240
Do you enjoy it or is it like really hard work

54:16.240 --> 54:19.040
to analyze the players to try to understand

54:19.040 --> 54:20.160
what are the different holes?

54:20.160 --> 54:21.160
What are the different mistakes?

54:21.160 --> 54:23.760
What are the strengths to avoid and that kind of stuff?

54:23.760 --> 54:25.640
I think the only thing that makes it harder

54:25.640 --> 54:27.400
is when you're young, right?

54:27.400 --> 54:28.240
And you're in your twenties

54:28.240 --> 54:29.920
and you're trying to make your nest egg.

54:29.920 --> 54:31.800
You're like, you're trying to make your retirement money.

54:31.800 --> 54:32.920
You're hungry, right?

54:32.920 --> 54:35.440
You're like Clubber Lang and you know, the gym, you're hungry.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.440
Whereas, you know, Rocky's in there, take the pictures

54:37.440 --> 54:39.920
and smiling and doing commercials and stuff like that.

54:39.920 --> 54:41.120
So I am 47.

54:41.120 --> 54:42.480
I'm financially okay.

54:42.480 --> 54:44.080
I don't need to win.

54:44.080 --> 54:46.240
I don't need to compete at the highest levels.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.640
So I think it was a boxer.

54:47.640 --> 54:48.960
I don't remember which one.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.360
When asked this, he was asked the question,

54:51.360 --> 54:52.760
you know, how do you get up in the morning, you know,

54:52.760 --> 54:54.760
still and do those morning runs?

54:54.760 --> 54:56.560
And he says, you know what, I'll be honest with you.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.840
It's a lot more difficult doing the 4 a.m. run

54:58.840 --> 55:00.800
in silk pajamas, right?

55:00.800 --> 55:02.120
It just is, right?

55:02.120 --> 55:05.760
But I've always been self-motivated

55:05.760 --> 55:07.120
and I've always found a way.

55:07.120 --> 55:09.720
So it's harder in the sense of like,

55:09.720 --> 55:13.040
it's not a need, I can still get by without it.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.600
But, so in that regard,

55:14.600 --> 55:16.120
it does feel like a little bit of work.

55:16.120 --> 55:16.960
We're like, oh my God,

55:16.960 --> 55:19.000
that's a lot of footage I gotta get through.

55:19.000 --> 55:20.360
And I don't know that I have the time or I don't know

55:20.360 --> 55:24.040
that I wanna spend 10 hours of my day doing that

55:24.040 --> 55:25.680
when I could be doing other things.

55:25.680 --> 55:29.040
I mean, what do you still love about poker?

55:29.040 --> 55:30.560
When you said, when you enter,

55:30.560 --> 55:34.440
like the times you catch yourself just being able

55:34.440 --> 55:37.920
to sort of take in the awe of it.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.360
What aspects do you love?

55:39.920 --> 55:40.760
I think that like for me,

55:40.760 --> 55:42.160
I've always been really competitive,

55:42.160 --> 55:44.040
but I was never gonna be a professional athlete

55:44.040 --> 55:45.200
or a professional snooker player.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.800
I wasn't good enough at any of that stuff.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.160
I didn't have the body type, whatever.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.600
But poker, it sort of levels the playing field, right?

55:51.600 --> 55:53.960
You're six, five, 240, big deal.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.880
You know, we're not fighting here.

55:55.880 --> 55:57.560
We're fighting a different type of war.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.960
So the competitive aspect,

55:58.960 --> 56:02.680
I also have always been fueled throughout my career

56:02.680 --> 56:04.240
by doubters.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.720
So this is probably unhealthy,

56:05.720 --> 56:09.040
but every time people say like, you're done,

56:09.040 --> 56:10.480
you're washed up, you can't win anymore.

56:10.480 --> 56:13.600
It just makes me wanna prove them wrong, right?

56:13.600 --> 56:15.320
So I have a little bit of that in me,

56:15.320 --> 56:17.760
which again, reading the comments and all these kinds.

56:17.760 --> 56:19.720
Like I've been told many times throughout my career

56:19.720 --> 56:21.200
for the last 15 that I'm done.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.560
I can't compete anymore.

56:22.560 --> 56:27.280
And I enjoy, you know, proving them wrong.

56:27.280 --> 56:29.960
Yeah, the game has changed so much.

56:31.800 --> 56:34.360
The greats of the past surely cannot be the greats

56:34.360 --> 56:35.240
of the present.

56:35.240 --> 56:37.920
Those, that kind of commentary will continue

56:37.920 --> 56:38.840
for every sport.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.480
And certainly for poker,

56:40.480 --> 56:42.080
because poker really changed a lot

56:42.080 --> 56:43.680
over the past couple of decades.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.640
Can you speak to how much it has changed?

56:45.640 --> 56:46.480
Yeah.

56:46.480 --> 56:47.400
Because it's been at the top for so long.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.360
Yeah, so complacency is a big issue

56:49.360 --> 56:51.320
for people who make it, if you will, right?

56:51.320 --> 56:52.920
So in my era of the poker boom,

56:52.920 --> 56:54.240
around the early 2000s,

56:54.240 --> 56:56.480
there was a group of players who were the big names,

56:56.480 --> 56:57.680
the stars of the game.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.440
Well, a lot of them had their egos out of whack,

57:01.440 --> 57:03.880
where they just felt like, okay, I'm the best, that's it.

57:03.880 --> 57:05.600
Like, no, there's young guys learning.

57:05.600 --> 57:06.840
There's new software.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.840
There's solvers.

57:07.840 --> 57:08.680
There's all these kinds of things.

57:08.680 --> 57:11.040
And if you're not keeping up, then you'll get surpassed.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.080
And I remember myself at a very early age saying,

57:14.080 --> 57:15.280
I never want to be that guy.

57:15.280 --> 57:17.800
And it was one of my first events in the late 90s.

57:17.800 --> 57:21.000
I was the young buck playing with the Tom McAvoy's

57:21.000 --> 57:23.440
and Brad Doughty, the guys of the era, right?

57:23.440 --> 57:25.400
And I was doing things more aggressively

57:25.400 --> 57:27.880
and they were scoffing at all these young kids

57:27.880 --> 57:29.840
with their aggressive three and all this stuff.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.080
And they were sort of mocking it, you know?

57:31.080 --> 57:33.160
And I thought, never be that guy.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.880
Always have the humility to be introspective

57:35.880 --> 57:38.120
and always have the respect for your opponents

57:38.120 --> 57:41.160
that while you think you've got it all figured out,

57:41.160 --> 57:43.280
they're learning new things and you can learn from them.

57:43.280 --> 57:46.520
So I've always been willing to sort of swallow my pride

57:46.520 --> 57:48.760
and get coached by younger players,

57:48.760 --> 57:50.200
who I might even be better than,

57:50.200 --> 57:53.200
but they see blind spots that I have that I might not.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.160
And they help me improve my game.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.840
I've always been willing to sort of look every six months

57:57.840 --> 57:59.280
or a year and say, is what I'm doing working?

57:59.280 --> 58:01.600
And if not, how do I get better?

58:01.600 --> 58:06.280
But most people from my generation, they go the other way.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.360
I don't know, they just have this idea

58:07.360 --> 58:08.200
that they figured it all out.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.000
Once you feel like you've mastered it,

58:10.000 --> 58:10.840
there's nothing left to learn.

58:10.840 --> 58:14.800
That's the moment where everyone else starts to surpass you.

58:14.800 --> 58:17.760
That's the moment where you lose the mastery

58:17.760 --> 58:18.840
because it's always evolving.

58:18.840 --> 58:20.640
How has the game changed?

58:20.640 --> 58:21.560
So the game has changed

58:21.560 --> 58:23.720
in terms of the way people learn it, right?

58:23.720 --> 58:25.600
When I started out, the only way to learn how to play poker

58:25.600 --> 58:28.360
was to sit your ass on the chair and play.

58:28.360 --> 58:29.200
In person?

58:29.200 --> 58:31.040
Yes, in person, play.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.800
Maybe you jot down hands on a notepad.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.680
We didn't even have cell phones back then, right?

58:34.680 --> 58:36.360
So I would write notes.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.120
I actually brought a notepad and then analyze it

58:39.120 --> 58:41.360
and sort of try to figure it out that way

58:41.360 --> 58:44.600
and think about maybe talking to friends

58:44.600 --> 58:45.560
and different players.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.240
Like when I grew up, there was John Gwanda,

58:47.240 --> 58:48.760
Alan Cunningham and Phil Ivey.

58:48.760 --> 58:50.600
And we would sort of create

58:50.600 --> 58:52.240
like a little bit of a mastermind.

58:52.240 --> 58:53.240
Well, how would you play this hand?

58:53.240 --> 58:54.080
What would you do here?

58:54.080 --> 58:56.120
That was the extent of it, right?

58:56.120 --> 58:57.920
We never had the correct answers.

58:57.920 --> 59:00.520
We always had theories about what might be right.

59:00.520 --> 59:03.200
Not until about five, six years ago,

59:03.200 --> 59:04.600
where everything changed,

59:04.600 --> 59:07.480
where artificial intelligence created solvers

59:07.480 --> 59:11.000
that will specifically say, okay, this is the optimal play.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.760
This is the game theory optimal play.

59:12.760 --> 59:16.200
So now it introduced poker to a whole new group

59:16.200 --> 59:18.480
of like personality types.

59:18.480 --> 59:21.440
In my day, it was people that were dregs of society

59:21.440 --> 59:24.240
that didn't fit in, not college goers with a degree.

59:24.240 --> 59:26.560
These are people who were street hustlers playing pool.

59:26.560 --> 59:29.640
They found poker and they had these unique lives, right?

59:29.640 --> 59:32.720
But now, because poker can be studied,

59:32.720 --> 59:35.280
much like you study university or college,

59:35.280 --> 59:37.440
you had, for example, the German contingent

59:37.440 --> 59:39.320
who was literally analyzing data

59:39.320 --> 59:41.280
and coming up with strategies based on this.

59:41.280 --> 59:42.600
And it's like, what?

59:42.600 --> 59:44.440
And the old guy, like,

59:44.440 --> 59:45.760
gotta play by feel or whatever.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.320
And they're like, they're learning.

59:47.320 --> 59:49.440
So I guess the way that you describe it is like,

59:49.440 --> 59:52.160
in the old days, it required skill and talent,

59:52.160 --> 59:53.840
a card sense, right?

59:53.840 --> 59:55.080
That was the only way to become good.

59:55.080 --> 59:56.960
And today, that's not the case.

59:56.960 --> 59:59.520
Good study habits, a good work ethic in that regard

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.200
can make you like a really good player,

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:05.000
even if you aren't all that talented or gifted.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.440
Having a good work ethic is a talent, right?

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.480
Not necessarily card sense,

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.680
but if you're able to put in the work

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.200
and study from these solvers,

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.400
you essentially have the perfect study tool now

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.160
that we didn't have in my day.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.920
So what do the solvers give you?

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.120
Do you start to memorize the optimal play

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120
for every single hand?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.320
You try your best.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.720
So again, solvers are imperfect as well

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.720
in terms of the way the humans utilize them, right?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.880
Because you can give solvers a certain number of inputs

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.480
in terms of what you want it to solve,

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.880
but a solver can think on many, many levels.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.240
So for example, the way that a typical player

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.560
would do a solve is to say, okay,

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.880
what does a solver think is the best play here?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.720
Bet one third pot, bet two thirds pot,

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.560
or bet one and a half times pot, okay?

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.360
You give it three parameters,

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.840
it comes out with an output,

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.400
and it tells you what you should do

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.280
with all the different hands you have.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.800
However, that's a simplified version

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.880
of what a solver would really do

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.520
because a solver might decide

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.080
that seven times the pot is best, 10% of the pot.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.840
But when you're putting in a solve,

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.520
you can only put in specific parameters.

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.880
So that's why, frankly, that's typically the number,

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.120
one third, two third, and one and a half times pot

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.480
is what people often do.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.800
So they sort of have a vague idea of what a solver wants.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:26.640
But again, imperfect in terms of the implementation of it.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.080
And memorizing all the variables,

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.760
like that King Jack offsuit with the King of Diamonds

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.800
is 13%, no human brain can do that.

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.480
So what you do is you bucket it.

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.000
Like you bucket it into, say, instead of 10,000 variables,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.600
you have 10 buckets, and you say, okay,

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.120
with these hands, we do roughly this,

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.160
and we do roughly this.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.240
And you try your best to stay within those lines.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:50.440
But again, what I love about live poker, partly,

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:54.560
is that nobody will ever be able to master game theory,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.760
you know, and mimic a solver.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.760
But you also have to incorporate your position,

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:06.400
where you are, and obviously what cards you have,

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:09.880
but also the size of your stack, how much money you have,

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.560
and also whether you have the ability or desire to buy in,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.400
all those kinds of things.

01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:17.600
So you have to calculate all of that, right?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.400
So the solver will do that, right?

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.080
And essentially, you don't input your hand.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.600
It tells you, you'll look at the grade,

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.280
and be like, all right, this is my hand,

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.120
and it tells you what it is.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.920
But it tells you what you would do with any hand, right?

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.240
It gives you the full output.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.000
And that actually gives you a better idea,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.760
because you're ultimately, like you said,

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:39.360
playing a range of hands, not a hand.

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.200
And the solvers do things that are really interesting.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.000
You've seen AlphaGo, I would imagine.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.680
Brilliant film, right, I thought.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.880
And I thought what was interesting is there was,

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.080
you know, accepted theory from all the top Go players

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.120
that this is what you do.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.320
But the AI was doing things way different,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.680
and they're like, this has to be wrong,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.840
but really it wasn't.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.720
So for example, a solver may say this, right?

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.320
Let's say you bet on the end, and you bet a lot,

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:07.440
and a solver may say, you should fold here

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.000
with a pair of kings and a queen kicker,

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.960
which is, you know, a pair of kings,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.040
but call with a pair of fours and an ace kicker.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.840
So it's essentially telling you

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.760
that you should fold this hand

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.040
that is much better than this.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.120
So it begs the question, why?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.960
Because what the solvers do is they use the information

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:30.360
of your own cards to formulate all the possible hands

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.040
your opponent can have.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.120
So if your opponent is,

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.600
so basically if you had the king, queen,

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:41.600
you know, it may say, for lack of a better nerdy term,

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.640
it blocks potential bluffing hands that your opponent can have.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.720
So let's say if your opponent would bluff with queen, jack,

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.120
but you have a queen.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:51.280
So there are less combinations of queen, jack.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.160
So it will find a better bluff catcher, if you will.

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.520
So that's what's really not intuitive to poker players.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.000
Poker players usually think like,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.800
well, my hand is pretty good, so I got to call.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.560
But that's not how a solver would think.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.840
A solver uses, you know, common eight tricks and, you know.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.600
And sometimes it's tough to get the good why answers

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.280
you just did for why a solver thinks something is better.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.840
Or maybe in poker it's a little bit easier,

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:18.840
but in the case of go and chess, it's not always obvious why.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.440
Because it's not going to explain stuff to you.

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:21.400
But I think what's the,

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.480
I think one of the best ways to learn poker

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.120
is when you see a solver output

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.280
and it tells you one of these things, try to figure out why.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.040
Why does this solver do this?

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:32.440
Why does it want you to call with this and fold this

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.200
and try to think about it on a deeper level?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.080
And you go, aha, probably because this card that I have here,

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.600
you know, changes the range of my opponent's, you know, potential.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:45.560
I'd love to get your opinion on your relationship with solvers.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.960
Because for example, Magnus doesn't use them.

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:54.200
His team uses them because he feels like he's going to rely on it too much

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.120
and you can't use it when you're playing.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.200
What you really want is to build up extremely strong intuition

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.800
without the help of a solver.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.880
Is there some aspect of that that rings true to you?

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.040
Absolutely. I totally can relate to what Magnus is saying.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.920
First and foremost, because when solvers were first introduced,

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.120
I didn't come from that world.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.640
I was so intimidated because I didn't know how to use it.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.400
I don't know how to do an input.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.520
So I had two guys, one guy is a data scientist

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:20.640
and, you know, and other guys like a poker savant, if you will.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.480
And they coached me and they did it.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.240
So today, if I was in a tough spot, you know, and I'm like, I don't know,

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.080
what would a solver do?

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.920
I will send them the hand and they'll run the solve for me

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.320
and then sort of give me the parameters of what to do.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.680
When I was playing, you know, regularly using solvers with them,

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:40.240
we were spending six to eight hours a day going over all these solves.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.040
So intuitively, I started to think and learn about what the solver would want.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.880
But I sort of understand where Magnus is coming from in that

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.720
you don't want to become a slave to the Sim, as I say, right?

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.120
There's one kid I know, I joked with him, his name is Landon Tice.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.680
And, you know, he made a play that the Sim, you know, would say,

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.840
this is a good play.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.800
But I'm like, it's a good play, you know, in a simulated world against the robot.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:05.080
It's not in practice against the human, right?

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.640
You don't need to be doing that.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.600
So if you become a slave to the Sim and always do what the Sim says,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.080
you're handcuffed to a certain degree.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:18.280
Is there some, at the highest level plays, there's still a role for feel?

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.120
100%. Absolutely.

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.720
If you're not doing that, because here's the thing, right?

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:27.640
No human being plays perfectly balanced in Game 3 Optimal like a robot would.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.200
They're not, right?

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.720
So there are opportunities there to take advantage of the things that they do

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.800
that are slightly too aggressive or less aggressive.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:41.080
You know, for example, say most human beings don't bluff enough in a certain spot.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.640
So you don't have to call with the correct range of hands.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.000
You don't have to, because they're not bluffing at the optimal frequency.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.480
So you don't have to call at the optimal frequency.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.840
You'd be making a mistake, frankly, if you did.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:59.480
What's the difference between in-person and online play, given that context?

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.360
Yeah, well, online poker and live poker, it's the same game, right?

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.800
Same, it's poker, but it's different in so many levels, right?

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.000
I think playing online, you have to focus far more on fundamentals.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.960
You know, on game theory, you don't have the added bonus of looking across the table

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.520
and getting any sense of whether your opponent is strong or weak.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.280
They're bluffing, whatever, you know.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:26.680
And also, because online poker, those that play it, you play far more hands.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.400
Like some of these guys are playing 10, 20 tables at the same time, right?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.360
So you're just hitting the long run really quickly,

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.080
and you're creating a database on your opponents, right?

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:37.520
So let's have, you know, online, I can see your data.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.480
I'm like, well, this guy, he's playing 40% of hands.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.200
He's bedding the river 80% of the time.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:46.280
So now I can use that data and, you know, exploit you that way.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.000
When you play live, you don't have that.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.160
Do you enjoy playing online?

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.360
I enjoy, so with online poker, I enjoy the convenience of it,

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.360
because, you know, you can be on your couch, in your underwear, not leave your house.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.480
Do you also play multiple games at the same time, or do you try to play one game?

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.080
I typically like to play one or two, but I can play up to four.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:11.280
I find that past four, it's hard for me to keep up and keep track of what's actually happening.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.160
You know, it's a different mindset required.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.680
Like a lot of these young guys, they're accustomed to 20 tables at a time.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.560
It feels like the purity of the game is gone.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.920
I mean, it's much more robotic, right?

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.960
So if you're playing 20 tables, you're just making decisions based on like what, you know,

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.560
you're not thinking about the depth of the situation and what just happened 15 minutes ago.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.240
You don't even know what happened because you can't pay attention to all that at once.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.440
And some of the magic of poker is the low sample.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:38.160
I agree.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.160
Like, for example, and sorry to be bringing up Magnus so much,

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:45.560
but there's so much parallel between the two of you and the poker and the chess world.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:51.680
He hates Olympics and world championships and all that kind of stuff because it's so low sample.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.360
But to me, that's part of the magic of it.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.840
There's the World Series of Poker, the main event.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.360
There's a magic to it.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.240
I agree, yeah.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:03.720
And I don't know what that is exactly because so much of the stake is so rare,

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:10.040
so much drama and heartbreak leading up to it that all somehow,

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:15.320
yeah, it accumulates to that magical moment when somebody wins.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.400
Especially that event.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.160
The World Series of Poker main event, historically, like that's it.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.040
You know, that's the pinnacle.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.520
That's where like mainstream watches.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.920
That's where people are tuning in and the gravity of the moment.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.640
You know, it's so much bigger than people.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.440
Like everyone gets the opportunity to play armchair quarterback too, right?

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.520
Oh, he should do this.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.600
You're not there.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.640
You're not under the lights.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:35.000
You're not under the pressure.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You know, it might seem easy for you at home to be like, well, they have it

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.400
because you can see the whole cards.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:40.520
You know, they can't.

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.240
Certainly, the idea of the small sample with tournaments,

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:51.520
I like the idea that you don't have to worry about, oh, well, if I do this now,

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.000
then in the future, you know, I won't be balanced.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.680
I have to be balanced here or anything like that.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.040
That's like really boring and lame, right?

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.080
Again, that is kind of the way the younger generation learns how to play the game,

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:07.960
being balanced in every spot and then randomizing, you know, like, oh,

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.240
I'm supposed to do this 50% of the time.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:12.360
OK, so if my left card is red, I'll do it.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.240
And if it's black, I don't.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.000
So you're not even making, you're no longer making actual decisions for yourself.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.440
You're just randomizing.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.200
And that's way less fun for me than tailoring it to the situation.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.480
And the final table at the main event, there's none of that.

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.240
You have to, I mean, it's all or nothing.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.840
Well, you shouldn't be, but there are.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.880
Like, again, I think a lot of the young guys, they are thinking in that regard,

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.840
like, oh, randomization.

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.080
Maybe at that table, the final table at the main event,

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.920
what's the hand that stands out to you that was especially gutsy and powerful

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.120
or memorable for that you've seen in the history of poker?

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.640
Well, for me, the one that stands out and probably because I was so young

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.240
and it was my first year, like, well, I won a bracelet that year,

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:56.400
was I was friends with Scotty Wynn, the Prince of Poker.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.960
And he was heads up against the guy named Kevin McBride.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:02.280
And I was on the rail, you know, I'm like, wow, he's going to, you know, he's heads up.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.440
And he was so cool.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:05.920
Like, he had a mullet, but it's perfect, right?

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.600
He had the white shirt, the black thing.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.080
He's drinking a Michelob, smoking a cigarette, whatever, you know, all chill.

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.760
He bets it all on the river.

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.720
And the guy's thinking and he psychologically owned him.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:20.160
And he said, he goes with his beer, he goes,

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.520
you call it gonna be all over, baby.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.560
That's right.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.120
Okay, so this guy who was an amateur heard that

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.280
and was like, there's so much pressure in this moment right now.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.840
I can't handle this pressure.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:34.960
But Scotty just told me, if I call here, the pressure's gone.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.200
I don't have to be under it anymore.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.760
So he sort of hypnotized them into making the call.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.440
You know, and Scotty had it.

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.200
Scotty had, you know, the full house and it was over for the guy.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.000
You call it gonna be all over, baby.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:49.280
I love that aspect, sort of the table talk dynamic,

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:52.760
which isn't as prevalent today as it was back then.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.160
But that one sticks out.

01:11:55.160 --> 01:11:57.120
And probably because it was one of my first.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.080
So the few words you say at the table

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.080
can completely affect a hand like that.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.640
That's almost, that's scary.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:09.400
It was just so cool to me.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.880
You know, like just how he was so calm.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.880
And I think that too added more pressure to the amateur.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.520
And I think like, again, part of it is,

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.360
even back then it was 1998,

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.600
there's still a big rail of people and there's lights

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.880
and they're, you know, they're filming

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.720
and all this kind of stuff.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.240
And it's a lot of pressure for a guy

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.560
who's never been in this environment.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.080
And now I'm telling you, it can all be over soon.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.560
It will all be over soon.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.680
Just call, it's finished.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.160
Something about that accent too.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.640
Now you're a master at table talk as well.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.240
Do you have, do you just kind of go with your gut,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.120
you flow with it or is there a deliberate strategy

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.240
with this sometimes?

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.760
There's usually some sort of strategy that I think about

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.400
in terms of what I want to say and whatnot.

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.560
But a lot of the time I just go, I go with it, you know.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.200
The more you talk, the more information you get.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:02.000
Yeah, but in some cases against really good players,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.280
you're just giving away information, right?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.600
Like if I'm playing against Phil Ivey,

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.040
I'm not engaging in anything

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:08.960
because he can read through it.

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.480
He can sense based on what I'm saying, you know,

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.680
the clues and where I'm trying to take him.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.600
And he reads through, he sees the tree through the forest

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.640
or whatever you want to call it,

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.000
the forest through the trees.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.960
And, you know, so then I would just be like

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.520
allowing myself to be exploitable.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.640
Is some of it just for fun?

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.400
Because at the end of the day, if you're having fun,

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.280
you might be at the top of your game.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.320
I've been thinking about this a lot lately, actually.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.200
It's funny you bring this up because I've been thinking

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.960
about when I'm at my best.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.480
And I think I'm at my best when I am comfortable like that.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.320
Right?

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.160
Where I'm not so stiff.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.840
And worried about, you know, checking properly

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.880
and worried about reading people.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.440
I'm like, no, I'm me.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.280
All right, I'm going to play some football.

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.120
What do you want to do?

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:48.940
You want to call me?

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:49.780
Call, go ahead, do what you want.

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:50.620
Right?

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.600
Because then I realized, you know, ultimately it was like,

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.040
I'm comfortable in that.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.560
My opponents aren't as comfortable in that.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.880
They're comfortable with this.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:57.240
You know, the robot thing.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:59.920
But I thought more about that and how,

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.880
especially with some tournaments coming up,

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.840
I plan on really kind of sort of getting back

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.200
to my roots in that regard.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:08.480
I love it.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.040
From a spectator perspective, I love it.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:11.000
But it's also interesting.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.400
Whenever you see a day and you want to go on a quiet,

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.520
that's an interesting, like,

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.920
like it feels like a calm before a storm of sorts.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.440
So I'm sure that's also part of it.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.200
Yeah, like I've gone, I've flowed.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.000
Like I said, you know, I took on some coaches

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.400
and that was really learning game theory.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.640
Cause I felt like it was important to always stick,

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.200
you know, keep up with what's going on.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.520
And then I do feel like to some degree,

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.400
it sort of took away a little bit of my own

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.240
instinctual ideas in terms of what I should be doing, right?

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.800
So I think like the most dangerous version of myself

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.760
is a deep understanding of the game theory

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.000
with my wisdom of many years of,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.160
and comfort of just sort of like being myself at the table.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.560
And being relaxed.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.400
Relaxed.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.520
Letting your mind flow.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.240
Let me ask you the greatest, the goat question,

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.200
greatest of all time.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:03.280
Can you make the case for a few folks?

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.200
So first you tweeted referring to Phil Ivey

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.320
as the goat, saying the goat doing goat things.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.720
That's a recent tweet.

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:14.200
So can you make the case for Phil Ivey?

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.560
Or maybe who is the greatest poker player of all time?

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.040
Would you put Phil?

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.840
For me, until someone knocks him off the podium,

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.640
the king of poker and the goat is Phil Ivey.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.240
Okay, so, and the reason I say that is

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.520
I think of poker is more than just one game, right?

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:29.880
There's different variants.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.440
You know, there's Hold'em, Omaha, Stud, Triple Draw,

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.040
all these different types of games.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.920
And Phil, in every arena, has been dominant.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.560
Whether it was tournament poker, dominated it.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.680
Mixed game high stakes poker in Bobby's room, dominated.

01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.880
Online poker against all the Wizards, dominated.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.600
Made millions in every arena.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:51.200
And you know, he sort of took a few years away from poker

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.720
with his legal troubles and things like that,

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:53.680
but he's back.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.280
You know, he's been playing in the high roller series again

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.160
and you know, he comes from,

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.840
he's cut from a different cloth.

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.880
But he has a tenacity and a focus

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.240
that's unparalleled, I think.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.440
When he's in the zone, I mean, for lack,

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:08.040
and this has nothing to do with race,

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.560
it really has to do with mannerism,

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.280
but he does remind me of like a combination

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.960
of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.040
in the way that he approaches it.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.680
He's very intense.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.000
And he outworks everybody, you know?

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.360
And I think, frankly, a lot of his mannerisms

01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.440
do come from them because he's young,

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.000
watching these guys on TV,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.240
and a lot of his ways of being, you know,

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.360
is learned behavior, I think probably from people like that.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:31.320
People at the top of their sport

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.400
and people that are Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.720
aren't just at the top of their sport,

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.160
but they kind of dominate the sport.

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.440
There's some kind of aura that-

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.720
There's a uniqueness to them.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.440
They're not built like us.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.760
They're not, you know, they're not.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.200
Like I wish, I wish I could have the kind of focus

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.560
that Phil Ivey has, you know,

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.600
and see everything that he's saying.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.520
I just, that's not me, you know?

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.160
I don't have that, and he does.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.400
He has that gene, whatever it is.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.680
But they also look like they're not having that much fun.

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.160
They're more focused on the perfection,

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.080
like a dogged pursuit of perfection.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.880
And you know, that might even be true.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.080
It might not be as fun.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:03.920
You know, I don't know.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.080
Like I have fun at the table.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.200
When you look, outwardly, you look at someone,

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.560
like maybe he is having a blast.

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:11.080
Maybe that's just the way that he likes it, you know?

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.880
Like is Tiger Woods having fun when he's like on 17

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:14.720
about to win a major?

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.960
Doesn't look like it, theoretically.

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.280
Well, if you look at Michael Jordan,

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.360
I don't know about Tiger Woods,

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.800
but I think they're more focused

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:25.080
on every single mistake they make.

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.960
I think they're more obsessed about not making a mistake

01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:30.520
and hating every time they make a mistake.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:34.640
That's probably like 99% of their mental energy.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.440
I think that's part of what makes them great, right?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.200
They don't look past the mistake and just let it,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.040
it's whatever.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.640
They're like, they want to correct it.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.560
Yeah, there's a tension, almost like a trade-off.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.840
I wonder if that's always the case

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.240
between sort of greatness and happiness.

01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:51.720
I remember Huxied, who, you know,

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:54.000
when I was a kid growing up, he was like the poker idol.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.960
He won the world championship in 1996,

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.960
and I was lucky enough to hang out with him a little bit.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.160
And he would go through these streaks

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.480
where he had an A game and he had an F game.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.720
His A game was unparalleled.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.080
Nobody could beat him, right?

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.040
But his F game was so terrible that he was just a fish.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.240
You know, he was playing terribly.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.280
And I remember him saying,

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.320
and it was exactly what you're saying,

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.200
he'd make like one little mistake, right?

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.680
And then he would go off.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.280
And I was like, Huck, why do you do that?

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.680
Like, you know, your B game would be just fine.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:21.840
He's like, well, if I'm gonna make a mistake,

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.560
what's the point?

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.960
What's the point, right?

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.000
I'm just trying.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.320
Like, if you can't play perfect,

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.840
there's no point in playing at all.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.720
So he was extreme in that regard

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.040
and the way that he viewed it.

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:34.480
And depending on the sport, those folks,

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.400
like in chess, certainly the case,

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.520
that kind of mindset can destroy you.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.360
Absolutely.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.200
No, I totally see that.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.720
Because a sequence of mistakes,

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.760
like the kind of year you had with the World Series of Poker

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.400
can completely destroy a human being

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.080
if you're not able to see the bigger picture of it.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.200
Yeah.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:55.280
You said that Phil Ivey is the hardest,

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.360
your toughest opponent,

01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.800
the toughest person to play against.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:59.000
Why is that?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.720
And how do you beat him?

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.240
Because Phil Ivey's just,

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.840
he's seeing things that nobody else is seeing, really.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.800
Like subtle things, where I'm putting my hands,

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.760
where I'm looking, you know, my pulse,

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.680
like stuff that I don't even know I'm giving off.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.040
He's so engaged and so focused

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:17.640
and has such a, just a, he's fearless, right?

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:19.200
A lot of people, you know, they'll play poker

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.800
and be like, you know what, I don't think this guy has it.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.480
But do they have the guts?

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.360
Do they have the cojones, if you will,

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.600
to actually do anything about it, right?

01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.640
And stand up to this person?

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.200
He does, you know?

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.680
I forgot the hand that you tweeted about,

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:33.280
the goat doing goat things.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.000
It wasn't even that big of a goat hand,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.280
but like, there's hands where like,

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:39.960
there was a famous one in Australia

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:43.240
where the flop was like Jack Jack at nine

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:46.640
and Phil Check raised the flop with six, seven, nothing.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.840
Just absolutely nothing.

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.440
And the guy re-raised him, right?

01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:53.800
And Phil just knew he went all in with nothing.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.600
If the guy calls, he's done, he's cooked.

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:59.240
But he was so tuned in that this guy's not strong

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.200
that he just, you know, he did things like that.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.400
And it's tough to play against a guy like that.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.680
So he gets great reads and is able to execute on them,

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.960
has the guts to execute on them.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.600
He's got experience, he's got work ethic.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.120
He also, I think one thing I'm underselling too,

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.200
is his strategic mind, right?

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:21.760
Like, I believe that, you know, like I said,

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.440
the new age player, they learn how to play

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.200
through a very systematic approach.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:27.000
Okay, let's look at the data.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.040
Make up a game right now.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:31.040
Three cards, we each get three cards.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.000
Jacks are wild, sixes are, you know,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.560
six of hearts is wild, right?

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.800
Just make up that game.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:39.280
Phil will figure it out intuitively,

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.040
very, very quickly, right?

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.720
Without having the answers for him, right?

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.960
So that's like the difference

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.720
between the players of my generation.

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.840
We had to figure this stuff out on our own.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.840
Today, oh, I want to know the answer,

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.200
I go ask the computer and the computer tells me.

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:55.680
So I really believe like if you created a game from scratch

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:59.080
that Phil Ivey would be my horse that I wanted playing it.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.480
So he's in some sense in tune with some deeper thing.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.160
He has what we used to call card sense.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.680
Card sense.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.840
Can you try to make the case for some others

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.920
like Dwight Brunson, Phil Hellmuth, Daniel Nagrano,

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.720
and maybe one of the modern guys

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:17.200
like Justin Bonomo or somebody like that.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.040
Sure.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.960
Oh, so let's start with Doyle, okay?

01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.680
Like what Doyle has going for him above and beyond

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:25.040
is twofold really, the longevity.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.720
I mean, he's in his late eighties.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.200
And last time I played with him, I was like,

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.440
how is he getting better?

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.040
Like, I really felt like he was playing better

01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:34.600
than he had, you know, in the previous years.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.040
But also with Doyle, like Doyle had to figure,

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.880
you know, we talked about my generation

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.920
having to figure it out on their own.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.040
I mean, they really had to figure it out on their own.

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.200
Like they didn't have any computer simulation

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.720
to tell you Ace King was a favorite over pocket sixes.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.560
They didn't.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.400
So we know what he did.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.680
He would take a deck of cards

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.080
and they would deal out with a notepad, right?

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.360
Okay, Ace King won.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.640
And then they would do like a hundred of them

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.680
and be like, all right, Ace King won like 53.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.720
So it must be a favorite.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.720
And he did it manually, you know?

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.200
And he did it in a time when it was very, very difficult

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.160
and he's seen poker evolve and change throughout the years.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.240
Now, listen, is he gonna be able to compete

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.400
against the top players in the world today?

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:10.960
Absolutely not, you know?

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.680
But how many people, he's the best 88 year old player

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.440
in the world by a mile, okay?

01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.640
That's not even close.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.160
And Doyle, again, he's another guy who plays all the games.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.880
He's played high stakes cash, tournaments, you name it.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:24.480
He's iconic, you know, he's the godfather.

01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:26.440
So there's also an element to that.

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:30.520
So the iconic element, like you're a personality in poker.

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.360
I mean, not to romanticize this thing too much,

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.200
but poker is also a game of personalities.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:42.120
I mean, it's part of the greatness is like the uniqueness

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.040
of the human being.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.200
Yeah, I think also, yeah.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.320
Looking at it from that perspective in terms of like Goat,

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.320
like Goat in terms of what you represent,

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:51.400
like the cowboy, the godfather, you know,

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.840
he's been around, you know, he played in the sixties

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:54.680
and stuff like that.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.400
It's just something like incredibly cool.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.360
Like I often think about if I could go back in time

01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:01.280
and like visit, you know, an era,

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.200
I'd love to go like to Vegas in the seventies.

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.040
Just like, I can think of what it would smell like,

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.240
probably not ideal, cigarettes and, you know,

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:11.280
the leather jackets and just the vibe

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.160
of what it must've been like with the mobsters

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.000
and things like that.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.680
I mean, he's lived through all that.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.520
All the cool movies we've seen,

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:18.560
like Doyle talks about some of those films.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.160
And he's like, yeah, that guy off,

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:22.080
he said he was gonna stab me in my stomach.

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.840
You know, he knows these people.

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.240
It was, he's like a source of history, really.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:31.680
Yeah, when poker was a game for the mob

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.440
and the degenerates and all that kind of stuff

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:37.760
before it transitioned into professional sport,

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.040
professional game.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.640
Yeah, so he was there through the whole,

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.800
he's been there through the whole transition.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:43.760
He's seen it all, yeah.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.400
Yeah, and then to the online world.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:46.840
So what about,

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.760
I can't even say without smiling, Phil Hellmuth.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.720
Okay, so Phil, here's the thing with Phil.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:56.520
He takes it very personal when I say this.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.080
And he doesn't hear the compliment.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.600
He only hears the negativity.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.760
Because Phil wants to be considered

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:01.600
the greatest of all time.

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:02.560
Hashtag positive.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:04.400
He wants to be the greatest of all time.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:07.080
But I'm like, Phil, here's the facts.

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:10.160
You have the best, absolute greatest resume

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.360
at the World Series of Poker of anyone in the world.

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.000
Is that not enough, right?

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:14.880
That's what you have.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.240
You have that, right?

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.720
Now, do I think you're the best

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.360
no limit holding player in the world today?

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.200
No.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.840
Do I think that you can play high stakes mixed games

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.440
with the best players in the world today and win?

01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:25.360
No, right?

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.400
So he wouldn't get as much flack on this topic

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.680
if he wasn't so boastful and demanding.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:34.240
You never hear Phil Ivey say, I'm the best in the world.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.800
His peers do, right?

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.160
But Phil wants to make the claim.

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.800
And I simply say, I beg to differ, right?

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.880
I beg to differ.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:45.520
I don't think you are the best player in the world.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:48.360
If he can linger on the compliment so he can hear it,

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.480
what makes him so good?

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:53.240
Because it seems like a lot of times his play

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.720
is not optimal.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.920
Yeah, he definitely has his own brand and style of play,

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:58.760
right?

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.320
He does not adhere to, he's never used a solver

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:01.160
in his life.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.200
He doesn't know, he's not in that world, right?

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.560
Phil does, Phil has a lot of faith and a lot of confidence

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.560
in what he does and that it will be successful.

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.880
And I think there's something to be said about that, right?

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:13.680
He doesn't ever lack in belief that he can win

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:15.920
and he finds a way to do it his way.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.240
And frankly, a lot of what he does is very effective

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:22.800
against specific types of players who are intimidated

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:25.600
by him, by whether it's his resume or his demeanor

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.320
or his attitude sometimes, right?

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:30.360
Like if you're an average player and then you beat Phil

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.840
in the hand, you're gonna hear it.

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.000
This idiot from Northern Europe and beat me in this pot.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.200
And for some people, they don't like that.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:39.840
So he can use that against them.

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.840
But I also think too, like he cares so much, right?

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.440
And that leads to trying really, really hard.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:50.880
Like he sees these moments and he doesn't phone them in.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.800
Like whatever brand of poker he plays, he tries his best

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:57.320
at all times to succeed and to win.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:00.080
And there's some, even though like he's fundamentally flawed

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.480
in a lot of things that he does compared

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:04.040
to some of the bigger players, his effort and will

01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.480
and like his determination to stick around is up there.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.240
And he is somebody who seems to really hate losing.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.080
Yes, yeah.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:17.840
He's got this, he feels like he deserves to win, right?

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:18.680
In all cases.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:22.000
And if he loses, it's, you know, it's not just-

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.200
As he joked around that you and him might do

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.080
an anger management course.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.640
Yeah, I did say that in one video.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.640
Now this is tough because you're a humble guy,

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.520
but objectively speaking, can you say

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.840
what your strengths are?

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:39.800
You're often listed as one of,

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:41.360
if not the greatest player of all time.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.080
So what are the things that make you stand out?

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.320
So for me, when I grew up,

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.240
I admired the big cash game players

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.080
because that's what I was.

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.280
I loved tournaments, but I wanted to be well-rounded.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.760
Like in my day, you couldn't make the Poker Hall of Fame

01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.240
if you just played one game.

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.720
You had to jump in to the highest stakes games

01:26:57.720 --> 01:26:59.800
in Bobby's room, as they say, right?

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.920
And I was able to do that.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.600
When I was in my early, in my mid 20s,

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.000
I was playing 4,000, 8,000 limits.

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.080
You could win or lose a million dollars in a day.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:09.200
So I grinded it out.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.160
Like a lot of people think, oh, you know, he's lucky.

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.520
He's had sponsorship.

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:13.360
Otherwise he'd be broke.

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.440
He's like, I built multi-million dollar bankrolls

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.000
before any of that stuff existed.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.160
And I did it the good old fashioned way

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.720
by sitting my butt on the table.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.040
I think probably one of my biggest strengths

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:25.600
is self-awareness.

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:29.080
And in that regard, a level of humility

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.960
that always allows me to say, okay, well, you know what?

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:34.440
In this case with these players, they're better than me.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.200
So what am I gonna learn from them, right?

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.760
Rather than have this need to say, I'm the best

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:40.040
because of history.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.520
I'm always looking to guys and go, wow,

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.480
he does this really well, whether it's the Adamos

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.600
or the Ivies or whoever it may be.

01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.000
So my willingness to adapt, I think,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.320
and stay relevant by learning what the young guys are learning

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.760
is something I've always done.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:58.160
And I also pride myself on, again, being well-rounded,

01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.240
like playing all the games.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:03.040
Like I don't feel intimidated in any game, you know,

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.480
whatever the format is.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:07.000
So always being a scholar of the game

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.760
as the game evolves, as the different games evolve,

01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:12.200
the different players evolve, the culture evolves,

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.960
always adjusting by being a scholar,

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.800
having the humility to be a scholar.

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.040
A healthy respect for, a healthy respect

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:20.160
for the younger generation, how they learn,

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:22.360
what they learn, and what they can teach me,

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:25.600
rather than poo-poo it and say, oh, these kids today.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:26.760
Because that's what a lot of people,

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.560
like the Mike Matisos and the Phil Hellmuse of my generation,

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:32.080
they just poo-poo it because they don't understand it.

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.720
On the level of one to 10,

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.760
their level of understanding of this is like a one, maybe,

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.600
if I'm being generous by calling it a one.

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.800
They really don't understand it, so they poo-poo it, right?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.080
It's easy to do that, like, oh, that's not how I do it,

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.560
so that's wrong, or that's stupid, or whatever.

01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.600
I don't take that approach.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:48.680
I go, well, let me learn.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.520
Let me see what there is to this.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:53.120
But that said, the crankiness that Matisos

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:55.200
and Phil Hellmuse have is great to watch,

01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.480
especially when they're on a table with you.

01:28:57.480 --> 01:28:58.760
Oh, I love it, yeah.

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.480
It's a blast.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:03.560
You're masterful at being able to get under their skin.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.280
What about somebody from the new school,

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:11.280
like Justin Bonomo, who's leading in terms of cash wins?

01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.000
Is there somebody like that that stands out to you

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.520
as a potential GOAT status person?

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.520
Yeah, so there's two different ones, but one is very...

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.120
So they're both just no limit, right?

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.920
So I, like, again, when I think of poker,

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.920
I think of a variety of games,

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.200
but there's so many of the young guys that specialize.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.240
Michael Adamo is one that I've mentioned several times,

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:32.720
and I love the way that he approached the game.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.160
Another one that's highly respected

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:37.040
because of his online prowess and his...

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:39.480
People have, like, looked at how close he is to game theory,

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:41.280
and they say he's about as perfect as you get.

01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.200
And it's a kid named Linus.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:46.360
Linus Love Online, Linus Linger.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.920
So he just came second recently, I believe,

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.120
in the Triton, huge Triton event.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.600
So he's primarily an online player.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:54.360
Yeah, he's an online cash player for the most part,

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:55.400
but he plays him live.

01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.920
And he's, you know, he's, again,

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.040
and I respect the peers that I play with who say,

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:00.680
he's tough as nails.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.840
There's another kid, too,

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.160
Russian kid named Timofey Kuznetsov,

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.920
and he plays all the games, and he's well-respected,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.640
you know, in that regard,

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.880
and the same with a guy like Jungle Man, Dan Cates,

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:14.320
who's a unique personality.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.760
I mean, this guy showed up,

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.480
won the Poker Players Championship back-to-back years

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.800
in a Randy Macho Man Savage costume,

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.200
and he was doing Macho Man the entire time.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:25.600
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take all the chips

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.240
like I did last year, bust them all.

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.440
And he was in character for the entirety of the tournament.

01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.280
This is great.

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.120
Just unique.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.040
But yeah, I respect for a lot of those guys.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:38.400
Is it gonna take time to figure out who,

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.160
you know, stands the test of time?

01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.440
That's the thing, right?

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.520
So a lot of these kids,

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.920
like there was a guy who beat me, heads up,

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.560
in the million dollar one drop.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.840
I got 8.7, he won $15 million, a kid named Dan Coleman.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.120
He was seen as like, you know,

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.400
the next big thing in poker, right?

01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.160
He made his money, just wasn't for him.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.160
So he's moved on, you know, to doing what he's doing.

01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:00.920
He's been skiing in the Alps, whatever.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.280
You know, we have nobody seen him

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.480
from like five, six years.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.800
So that can happen, right?

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:06.920
Because there is a lot of burnout.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.240
You know, I think like, I think it was actually

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.000
Gotham Chess who mentioned something

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.320
about how difficult it is to like,

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.160
I think it's true in poker.

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.120
When you get really, really good at something,

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.960
to get this much better, takes so much work.

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.360
And a lot of people don't necessarily wanna put in

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.600
that kind of work in order to do that.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.760
That's just, even staying at the same level

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.600
takes a huge amount of work.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.560
So if you wanna get better at chess,

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:29.640
you're already like really, really good

01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.600
and you're trying to get like one little bit better,

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:34.600
you have to study like in a ridiculous amount.

01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:37.040
You know, and again, that's once you've already had,

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.520
I think the toughest thing for anybody,

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:41.800
once you've tasted success and you've already achieved it,

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.800
staying hungry, staying on the top,

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.680
reaching the top is much easier than it is to stay there.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.000
Yeah.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.320
Over years, what's your training regimen in poker

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:58.320
in terms of how you keep improving?

01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.720
So you said you study games,

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:03.560
but that's mostly leading up to a particular tournament.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.760
But is there kind of a behind the scenes daily activity

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.520
you try to do that kind of over time keeps you sharp?

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:12.960
So for me, now that I'm 47,

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.320
and I feel like the predominant aspect of my poker game

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:19.200
is going to be in terms of my success

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.560
is gonna be my mental state, right?

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:23.840
So I find it's really, really important for me now

01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.680
at this age to have balance.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.640
So when I'm not playing poker and I'm out of it,

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.320
poker is not even on my radar.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.320
You're able to remove it from your mind.

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.160
Doing my fantasy hockey, play a little chess,

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:40.000
you know, play some golf, watch some hockey,

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.680
whatever the case may be outside of the game.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:43.800
And then I start to get the itch.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.600
Like after the World Series of Poker,

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:47.960
the poker door was closed.

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:49.240
Yeah, you took some time off.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.400
All of August, I didn't play any poker at all

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.080
until just recently, you know.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:54.480
I started to get the itch again.

01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.800
Because that's what's important for me

01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:58.240
is if I don't have the itch and I don't want to play poker,

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.720
then I'm not gonna be at my best.

01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.440
Once I start getting the itch,

01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.480
that's when I start to say,

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.640
okay, let's start watching some of these streams.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.800
Let's see what my opponents are up to lately.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:09.320
And, you know, let's look at some solvers

01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.960
and different things like that.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.400
And you're doing pretty good.

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.400
You came back and doing pretty good.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.240
Yeah, so far.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.600
Do you like being in front of the camera

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:21.640
through the hell of the World Series of Poker this year?

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:23.200
You filmed every single day.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.320
You did a vlog.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.400
Does that energize you?

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.240
Is that exhausting?

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.400
Because it's really beneficial to a huge amount of people.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.560
It energizes the poker community.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.200
But do you see it as a service

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.680
or do you purely just love it?

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.320
I've been comfortable on camera since I was a kid.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.160
When I was a kid, I wanted to be an actor.

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.400
Like really, really young.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.000
And it was always comfortable in that environment.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.760
I think like that gives me a little bit of advantage

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.920
sometimes too with these film events.

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.240
Because I'm comfortable with a mic on

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.880
and on camera with the lights.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:52.440
And I think a lot of people maybe aren't

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:54.320
with the knowledge that other people are gonna see

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.440
what they're doing every day.

01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:57.120
So it's been so comfortable and easy for me.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:58.720
As far as the World Series goes

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.720
and the vlogs and all the shooting,

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.280
it's kind of therapeutic for me.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:06.560
It is essentially my version of journaling, right?

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:08.600
So there's a lot of value I think in like

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.160
at the end of a day doing a brain dump

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:11.920
where you just write out and journal.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.520
But doing it on camera has this similar effect.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.600
And it also, when you make a mistake on your own,

01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.880
you're held accountable to you.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:23.320
But when I have to explain it to others,

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:26.280
like here's what I did and this is the mistake I made

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.720
or whatever the case may be.

01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.040
It actually, I think that helps me.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.480
Yeah, so you're held responsible by a larger audience.

01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:37.320
I think it's like, so like I said, listen, I'm 47.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:38.440
My life is good.

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:39.600
I don't have to be in this tournament.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.960
If I'm over it, I can just dump my chips off and go home.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.280
But I can't when I'm doing the vlog.

01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:49.080
I have to actually answer to that, you know?

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.040
And it keeps me in line.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.960
How hard is it to win the main event

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.200
of the World Series of Poker?

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.600
So the main event of the World Series of Poker

01:34:57.600 --> 01:34:59.320
is the hardest event to win

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.440
simply because of the sheer size of it.

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.320
You know, you're talking seven, 8,000 players, right?

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:05.400
And a lot of landmines.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:08.800
And frankly, there are so many players

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.800
that you've not played with before too.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.840
You play these high roller events, like these super ones,

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:15.320
you get 30, 40 people, you know everybody, right?

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:16.840
So you have an idea.

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.200
You said at the main event, you don't have any idea.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.000
This guy wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.200
and sunglasses, and he just raised you big.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.080
I don't know this guy, I don't know what he's about.

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.240
So there's a lot of like, it's grueling too.

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.360
You're seven, eight days where you're in the blender,

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.160
as you might say.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.080
So what's the structure?

01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.600
So it's $10,000 buy-in or something like that.

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:41.600
And there's a bunch of tables and you just keep playing.

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.080
Like when is it over for a single table?

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.080
So the way that it works is this.

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:47.840
So there's let's say 8,000 players.

01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:50.160
And the way the main event works, unique to others,

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:53.240
is there's various day ones you can play, right?

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.160
So a day one, you're gonna play from noon

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.320
to like midnight, right?

01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:00.040
If you're still in, you bag up your chips

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.080
and you'll come back for day two, okay?

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.360
There's four different day ones, right?

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:07.040
Now they'll all combine essentially to play on a day two.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.800
And at the end of the night, they redraw the tables.

01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:11.120
So you don't just win your table.

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.680
If players get knocked out, tables break,

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.280
they continue to be replaced.

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:18.120
So you start with 8,000, then after day one,

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:20.960
you've got 6,000, then you do the same.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.360
You play like a 12-hour day and you slowly whittle down.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:28.520
Day four, day three, day four, you're in the money.

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:29.840
And then you continue to progress.

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.480
And then what they do now with the final table is they,

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:34.360
because they were trying to do this for TV,

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:38.760
these final tables can take 12 hours to play.

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.120
And what we were finding was, you know,

01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.600
you start the thing at 5 p.m. and it goes till 8 a.m.

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:46.000
And like nobody's watching anymore.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.360
So they separate into three days now.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:51.360
And so you're talking now,

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:53.120
it's like six, seven days to get to the final table

01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:54.680
and another three days to play it.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:58.880
So you're grinding for, you know, a week and a half.

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.920
But most of the time, you're playing against people

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:03.880
you've never played against before.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.920
Especially early on, yeah.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.480
And then by the end, like, who knows?

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:08.560
You know, rarely do you see,

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.600
you see in the last hundred,

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.520
you usually see some notable names.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.800
Then in the last 27, you might see one, maybe two.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.480
Final table, maybe one.

01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.640
But often it's gonna be, you know,

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:20.040
some players you've never heard of before.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.120
Is there strategies that maximize your likelihood

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:25.480
of having a chance?

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:26.440
Yes, absolutely.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.040
Like I think the World Series of Poker Main Event

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:30.320
is a unique animal in that, you know,

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.400
like we talk about game theory and all that kind of stuff.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.200
If you're focused on that when you're playing,

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.700
you're really not playing well, right?

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:38.320
You need to just exploit.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:39.640
Because you're gonna have a lot of people

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.320
who see this as a bucket list item.

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:42.160
You know, they just wanna play

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.600
the main event of the World Series.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.920
And they might be scared, they might be nervous or whatever.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.800
You don't have to worry about being balanced, right?

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.560
Oh, you know, I have to make sure that I'm balanced.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.400
No, you don't.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.680
You might never, you're playing with this guy now

01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:54.760
for three hours, you might never see him again.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.720
So just make the play that makes sense for you, right?

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:00.080
So, so yeah, you're gonna,

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.680
I approach that event very differently than I would

01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:04.800
like playing against the high roller players

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.640
that I play with.

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:07.200
Does that mean more aggressive, essentially?

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.800
Less, actually.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.920
So when you play against really good players,

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:15.480
you have to take small plus EV scenarios

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.040
where you push the envelope

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:18.160
and you're playing really aggressive.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:19.480
You're bluffing off your stack.

01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.320
You gotta do this.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.760
You gotta focus a little bit more on being balanced.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:23.800
Because otherwise, you know,

01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:25.480
you're not gonna beat these guys.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.160
Whereas if you're playing with amateurs

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.840
and you're playing with regular players,

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:33.240
for the most part, risking all your chips on a bluff,

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.760
probably don't need to do that.

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:35.800
You don't need to do that nearly as much.

01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.400
You can probably slowly but surely build your stack

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:42.000
without taking those high risk, high variant situations

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.080
because you'll find better situations.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:47.280
What mistakes do amateurs usually make

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.760
in tournaments like that?

01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.200
Are they overbluffing?

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:52.320
Well, I think amateurs generally,

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.760
the biggest mistake they make is they think

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.280
that pros are bluffing more than they are.

01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.000
So like a pro will bet all his chips on the end

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.840
and like, ah, I don't know, maybe, you know,

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.480
this Phil Ivey, maybe he's doing some crazy stuff.

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:02.960
He's like, probably not.

01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:04.800
He's probably just got it, you know?

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.960
And then they lose all their money by calling

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.560
or going all in as well.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.960
And so the right thing is to be more patient.

01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.040
So amateur is too impatient or just bad reads?

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:21.080
So all the amateurs are built different.

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.360
Some of the amateurs are just too weak and passive.

01:39:23.360 --> 01:39:25.360
They're just waiting for the nuts, you know?

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.280
And then, you know, the pros, everyone notices that.

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.120
And then when they make their big hand,

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:30.560
they don't get paid anyway.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.760
So in order to win the main event,

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:35.000
I mean, you have to have some components

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:36.520
of your game that are aggressive.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:39.960
It's very unlikely to expect to just get the cards

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:42.440
the whole way and just always have the best hand.

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.560
You're gonna have to find ways to win pots

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.080
that, you know, where you don't have the best hand.

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.640
How do you win the final table?

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.200
The final table is unique now,

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.200
especially because you're talking about

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:55.520
the way that poker works in tournaments is that

01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:57.640
if there's seven people left and you have just a,

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.560
you know, you're very short on chips,

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.520
but if one other player goes out,

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:04.640
you just make like $300,000 for folding,

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.760
like just for sitting out, right?

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.760
The term for that that, you know,

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.280
kids use is ICM, independent, you know, chip model, right?

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.480
Where it talks about the value of each chip.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:17.440
Where what happens, what we see now is,

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.600
let's say one guy has a big chip lead

01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.320
and there's another guy who's second in chips

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.760
and there's a couple that are short.

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.960
These guys in the middle, they just play super tight

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.320
and they wait for the little guys to go

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.600
while the big stack is just pounding them

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.520
because he can afford to, right?

01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.000
He knows that people are handcuffed.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.880
So let's say I had 10 million in chips

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:38.240
and you have 9 million in chips

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.160
and these guys have little chips.

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:42.040
If I go all in on you, are you going to call me

01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.320
and risk like, you know, guaranteed pay jumps

01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:46.680
of like moving up a few spots?

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.560
So really the question comes down to like,

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:51.440
are you the type of guy who just wants to inch up

01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.920
or are you going to go for it?

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.000
And you're going to go for the win.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
I think ultimately there's some value

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.040
in being the guy who says, you know,

01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.680
I don't care if I come seventh.

01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.440
I'm not worried about going from seventh to fifth.

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.560
I'm here to win.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.840
And so you're saying like the guys that win

01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:07.080
will often be the ones that call there.

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.080
So like, they're not just bullying the small stacks,

01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:10.920
they're-

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:14.480
Well, they're the ones that are willing to risk it, right?

01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:16.800
So there are some people who, you know,

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.200
if there's five left, you know, and they're third in chips

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.960
and there's two guys very short and you, you know,

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:26.040
they'll have ace king and someone moves, they'll just fold.

01:41:26.040 --> 01:41:28.720
They fold the hand because they want to wait

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.600
for those two other players to get broke.

01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.240
And that way they, you know, they make actual money.

01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.600
So you, I guess the thought process

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:35.240
between winning first place

01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:37.400
and winning the most amount of money are different.

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.200
They're conflicting, right?

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.880
Because in order to like win the, if you're just,

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.560
if your focus is only on winning the tournament,

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.000
you will make mistakes financially

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.640
where you had guaranteed income for just folding, right?

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:51.520
Let's say a guy has one chip left, you know, one chip

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.280
and me and you have good chips

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:55.200
and I go all in with you and I lose.

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.800
Now that guy, you know, got the guaranteed, you know,

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.440
he got the pay jump that I wouldn't have got.

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.160
So there's some extremely stupid mistakes you can make

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:04.680
from a financial perspective, but it's often at odds with,

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.480
you know, giving yourself the best chance

01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:07.760
to actually come first.

01:42:08.680 --> 01:42:11.200
And in a tournament, especially the main event,

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.040
especially the final table, it's all about coming in first.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.480
Well, I know because most of the people who make it,

01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.360
so like, you know, when you play these high rollers,

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.480
these guys are accustomed to playing for a hundred thousand,

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:23.000
they're accustomed to this kind of money.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.200
So they're going to play, right?

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:25.680
But you're talking about guys

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:27.160
who bought into a $10,000 tournament,

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.520
maybe never had a hundred K cash in their life.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.440
And now they're sitting there and it's like one million

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.280
for fifth and two million for fourth.

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:37.320
So like, they don't want to be fifth,

01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.560
they're just going to sit there and go, ah, I don't want.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.680
So they'll be under more financial pressure

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:44.360
because they're not like your typical high roller

01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.200
type player.

01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:48.880
Are you still able to find the guts to take big risks?

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.720
Yeah, see, I'm trying to win.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.120
Like, I think that gives me an advantage, frankly,

01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.360
where I might make decisions that are financially suboptimal

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.920
because I'm trying to win,

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.080
but there's also an inherent advantage to that.

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.080
Like that, again, something I watched and learned

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.920
from a guy like Michael Adamo,

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.840
where he takes advantage of these people

01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.680
playing so passively in these spots,

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:11.960
where he's like, I'm not trying to come, I'm going to win.

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:14.160
I'm just going to bulldoze you

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.200
because I'm not worried about, you know,

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:21.200
the small financial mistake of, you know, a pay jump.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:25.560
What advice could you give to beginning poker players,

01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.760
or actually at every level, how to get better,

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.240
how to improve, how to improve their game?

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.640
Obviously, as you said, it's easiest to get better

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:36.040
in the beginning, but what advice would you give

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.320
how to get better?

01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:39.000
So one of the ways, I mean, I think way back

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.200
to how I started, right?

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.480
And there's so many resources and tools available right now

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:45.960
to analyze hands, but when you play, right,

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:48.400
and you find yourself in a situation or a hand

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:49.320
that you're not really sure about,

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.480
not because you had aces and went all in and you lost,

01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.600
like that's not interesting,

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.720
but an interesting situation

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:56.040
where you're not sure what you did,

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:59.240
jot the hand down, write it out,

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:02.040
and then either A, you know, use some of the tools,

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:03.960
whether it's the solvers, if you're, you know,

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.240
advanced enough, or ask your group, you know,

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.080
like have a couple of friends at your level

01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.800
and talk through the different decisions

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.680
and start to learn that way, right?

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.880
Because those mistakes that you make

01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.640
or those tough hands,

01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:17.320
that's where the real learning comes from.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.760
Like, so that, so basically, if you're,

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.520
because you're gonna be in similar scenarios.

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:24.360
In poker, you're rarely gonna have the identical situation,

01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.560
but you'll have situations that are similar.

01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:28.640
You know, you raised with Ace King, someone three bet,

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.800
another guy goes all in.

01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.960
Okay, well, what do I do in that spot?

01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:34.440
You know, it's, you're gonna have similar situations

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.280
in the future as well.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.160
So figuring that out, the more you can do that,

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:42.440
you chop away at, you know, different strategical mistakes,

01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.000
you know, you used to make that you no longer make.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.000
Are there resources?

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.320
Like your masterclass is really, is great.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.080
Are there books?

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:51.920
So there was a guy named Michael Ezevedo.

01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:54.280
This is my, again, for a little bit more advanced players,

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.320
but it's a book called Modern Poker Theory,

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.840
I think it's called,

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.200
which sort of explains game theory, right?

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.920
To the novice, right?

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:05.400
So it's a little bit, I think if you're new to poker,

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.440
it's probably above the rim for you.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.080
But once you start to get a little better

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.680
and you wanna understand how to do it,

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.440
it's probably a good resource for as far as books.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:14.800
And there's also like tons of people

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.040
who stream poker, professional players,

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.000
and then you can get in there and you get in on the chat

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.400
and you start talking, you ask them,

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:21.680
and you see people, you know,

01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.840
explaining their thought process and things like that.

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:25.320
There's so many free resources.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.480
And of course, my masterclass,

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.720
I think does a good job of sort of compartmentalizing,

01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:32.400
like, you know, how to attack it on a deeper level.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.240
And we, you know, we get it.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.840
I try to get into, it's funny, when I did the masterclass,

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.800
I asked them, I was like, well, you know,

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:41.640
how high end do you want this in terms of poker?

01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:42.920
And they're like, we want really, really high end.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.400
And I was like, oh, sure.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.040
And then I started to explain really, really high end.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:50.400
I'm like, okay, well, maybe the one below that, right?

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.920
So I try to explain really complex, you know,

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.840
theory in a more palatable way, in English, if you will.

01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:00.280
Because some of these kids, you hear them talk

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.200
and you'd be like, huh?

01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:06.200
But you also, which is really nice, give example hands

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:10.480
that really illustrate the point, which is really nice.

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.520
You also wrote a book, I think 10 years ago,

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.920
Power Hold'em Strategy.

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:19.280
It's interesting to think how much of the stuff

01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.400
in that book still applies, how much doesn't.

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:23.760
Listen, I still think the book holds up to a certain degree.

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:26.480
Obviously, like, you know, it isn't optimal

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.400
because there's like more advanced strategies.

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.360
And if you played that way,

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.960
people will figure out a way to exploit you.

01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.640
But if you're like an average player playing

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.240
an average buy-ins, like that's sort of what I coined,

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.840
like small ball approach, absolutely will work, you know?

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.960
At the highest level, you have to add much more,

01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:42.400
a lot more bluffing.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.680
But overall, I think it's still, you know,

01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:45.840
for the most part, there's a lot of really,

01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.720
especially with tournaments,

01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.000
there's a lot of really good principles in the book.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.760
What's the difference in the dynamics,

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:54.000
if you could just comment on, between a heads-up poker

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.600
and when multiple people are in one hand?

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.480
What an interesting aspect to everything

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.400
we've been talking about, from game theory

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:04.680
to exploitative strategies, all that kind of stuff.

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:06.120
So the biggest difference when you play,

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:09.080
let's say nine-handed, you know, against eight other players

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.840
and, you know, heads-up is, first of all,

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:14.440
just the type of hands and the number of hands

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.280
you're gonna have to play.

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.200
So the way that it works is if there's nine people,

01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.360
two out of the nine hands, you have to put in money.

01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.840
And the other seven, you could just fold for nothing, okay?

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.000
When your head's up, you're forced to put money

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.520
in every single hand, okay?

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:29.800
And there's only one other hand in front of you,

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.800
which means the ranges of hands that you play

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.560
is way wider, right?

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.120
So if you're nine-handed, right,

01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.280
and you're in first position, you're like,

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:37.960
all right, what do I need to play?

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.760
Like a good pair, you know, two high cards suited,

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.240
a big ace, you know, stuff like that, that's it, right?

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.400
That's what you're gonna play, right?

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:47.680
And you're gonna fold all the rest.

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:50.680
When your head's up, you look at a king and a two

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:52.440
and you're like, well, I gotta play this.

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:54.920
You know, you're gonna, you're forced to play

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.480
a lot more hands in a lot more complex situations

01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.920
when you're playing heads-up

01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:02.600
because you're gonna be playing much far weaker hands.

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.560
Queen five, jack three, all these types of hands,

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.640
and you're gonna see flops where you're not gonna have

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.040
any luxury of being like, I'm in there with a premium hand.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.160
Queens, kings, aces, those are easier to play, right?

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.720
Very, very strong holdings.

01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.440
Heads-up, you're forced to dance and fight a lot more,

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.600
you know, you can't sit in the weeds and wait.

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.800
What do you enjoy more?

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.760
Heads-up is very intense.

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.560
I like heads-up, but I think if you had to play heads-up

01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.040
eight, 10 hours, it's so mentally draining

01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:34.840
because you're faced with so many constant decisions

01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:37.080
each and every spot, like you play nine-handed,

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.240
you look at a nine and a three, you throw it away,

01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:41.000
you hang out for a bit, relax, you go,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.320
you get a little break in the play hand.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.080
Heads-up, you're like, it's like boom, boom,

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.280
it's like you're in the ring, you know,

01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:47.000
you're in the octagon and you're facing

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.120
like haymakers nonstop.

01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:53.800
Since we talked about online a bit,

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.320
is it possible to cheat in poker, especially online?

01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.400
We offline also talked about the cheating controversy

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.200
that's going on in the chess world.

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.680
Is it possible to use, what is it,

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:11.000
remotely connected anal beads to somehow cheat?

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.840
No, is that a concern of cheating online?

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.360
So here's the thing.

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.920
It's kind of like romanticized from the old days,

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.240
like in the Western stuff, like people trying to cheat.

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:24.200
And have you ever killed a man because he cheated?

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.000
No, I have not, but when I started out as a teenager,

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.880
I played in a game with a bunch of Italians

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:31.200
and I knew they cheated and I didn't care

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.720
because they were so bad that I could win anyway.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:34.800
I was like, I knew they would cheat,

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.720
but I knew how they were cheating.

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:37.200
So I was like, all right, you guys suck.

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:38.040
But so here's the thing.

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.000
Anytime you're talking about large sums of money,

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.600
there will be people looking to take advantage,

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.840
whether that's live or online, right?

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.680
And so it's like the job essentially of the, you know,

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:51.880
the online operators or the, you know,

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.600
live event staff to police it the best they can

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.640
and the players themselves being on the lookout for it,

01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:58.960
you know, like a guy like Dole Brunson is a great resource

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.520
because he's seen it all and he's seen all the tricks,

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.920
you know, and so live, you know,

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.520
he probably could spot a few things,

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.520
but online there's various ways people can try to cheat,

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:12.520
but there's also really good security measures in place

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:14.400
to catch them, you know?

01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.680
And we've caught, you know, like about two years ago,

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:20.480
there was a huge undertaking of like 500 accounts

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:22.760
that were banned for doing different things.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:25.040
And you know, there's, and again, you can't go in,

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.880
they can't go into detail in terms of how they're doing it

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:28.960
because otherwise, you know,

01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.200
then you're sort of giving the cheats the playbook

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.640
in terms of how to take advantage,

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.600
but it's always gonna be a concern for poker

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:36.680
wherever you play, right?

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.400
But it's not something I'm worried about personally.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.480
So at the highest in person, and by the way,

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:44.520
online there's really interesting algorithms

01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:47.960
that do some of the work in an automated way to detect,

01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:50.080
to flag things that are weird,

01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:52.680
but in person it's just not something at the highest level

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.240
that you're super concerned about.

01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:58.120
So it's not, it didn't quite infiltrate the poker world

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.040
to a degree where it's a huge concern.

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.720
Yeah, like, so here's the thing.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.040
I don't play in private games and whatever, right?

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.200
But in private games, theoretically, you know,

01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.840
you could be in, if you don't trust the people

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.920
you're playing with, like I've heard stories of people

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.680
where, you know, they have an earpiece in

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.400
that you can't see, right?

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:17.160
And they have, you know, like RFID on the cards

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:19.880
or something like that, and they have a phone reading it.

01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.440
So they have somebody in a truck telling them,

01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:23.080
you're gonna win this hand, you're gonna lose this hand.

01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:24.880
Like that happened in a private game.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.080
You know, and the guy, what's often funny about some

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:30.120
of these people who cheat is they're so greedy

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:32.440
and blatantly obvious that they get caught.

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:35.120
Where if they use this tool in a more subtle way,

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:37.320
they could probably continue to get away with it.

01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:39.600
But again, that's not something I worry about

01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.760
in a casino environment, you know, in these tournaments

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:43.840
and things like that.

01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840
But if I was playing in private games,

01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:48.160
like if I came down to Texas and some guy,

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:51.560
I got cheated in a game by a guy named Blackie Blackburn

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:52.640
and Tex.

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:53.480
That's a red flag right there.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.460
I was at the Chimo Hotel, I was a teenager,

01:51:55.460 --> 01:51:56.720
and they saw me playing, you know,

01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:58.400
I was making good money as a teenager.

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.840
I had like a $13,000 bankroll, you know,

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.040
and I went and played in this game with them

01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.220
in a private hotel room and found out later

01:52:04.220 --> 01:52:07.280
that the guy was a card mechanic, you know, he was dealing

01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.840
and he could, you know, deal you the hands

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.720
and he knew what you had and stuff like that.

01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:12.120
So yeah, I remember, you know,

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.480
I lost a big number in that game

01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:16.960
and it was a good learning lesson in terms of, you know,

01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:18.400
being wary of who you trust.

01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:22.160
Yeah, so if the dealer is in on it,

01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:23.880
that's one way you could cheat.

01:52:23.880 --> 01:52:25.480
It's fascinating.

01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:27.480
That's part of the reason that they cut.

01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:30.820
So like, you'll see like, there's a burn card

01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.160
because what would happen, you know,

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.700
maybe in the old days is like,

01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:35.480
if you're sitting in the one seat, I could lift the card

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.120
and you could see it, the next card coming, right?

01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.080
So what they do is they have a card on top of it

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:41.240
that you burn that isn't the card

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.080
and then the next card is the one that comes face up.

01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:48.640
I just learned about the edge sorting thing

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.040
that Phil Ivey and maybe others were involved with.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:55.680
I just, reading it at first was super interesting to me

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:59.520
that you can exploit the imperfections

01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.560
in the printing of cards.

01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.880
That was almost cool to me.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.840
That's almost not cheating because it's like-

01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:07.280
That needs to be a movie.

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.360
That needs to be a movie.

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.200
Yes.

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.760
Yeah, what happened with Phil Ivey in that whole case

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.880
is it's a catastrophe, really.

01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:15.760
It is such a horrible precedent because here's what he did.

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:17.240
Phil Ivey shows up at the casino says,

01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.160
I wanna play this game.

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.600
They say, okay, all right, I wanna play with those decks.

01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:24.000
They say, okay, they agree to everything that he says.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.400
He never touches the cards.

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.200
He doesn't do anything outside of the fact

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:30.360
that your cards that you supplied

01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.480
have imperfections on them and he can see them.

01:53:32.480 --> 01:53:33.320
Yeah.

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.680
Okay, so that increases his chances of winning.

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.040
He could still lose theoretically, right?

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.840
Probably not, but he can lose.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:41.800
In theory, it just gives him a little bit of an edge

01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:44.240
and it's all stuff based on what you provided.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.080
Yeah.

01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.520
So the idea that you offered a game, I accepted,

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:50.320
I beat you and now you wanna free roll me?

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.720
That's disgusting.

01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:53.840
So for people who don't know, maybe you can elaborate

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.200
and it's just fascinating to me,

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.320
but you're exploiting the imperfections

01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:59.480
in the card patterns on the back

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.800
and then they look different if you rotate it.

01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.880
And the fascinating thing too, when you shuffle,

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.960
usually you don't rotate the cards

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.480
so that you can see the sort of,

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:14.520
detect which cards are the strong cards

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:17.840
by marking them through rotating them.

01:54:17.840 --> 01:54:19.280
And the way you know they're rotated

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.520
is because of the pattern imperfections.

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.280
Yeah, so some of the cards, like you said,

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:26.080
like they had those like that pattern on it

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.440
and some of them, this was faulty cards on there,

01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:29.720
were not cut properly.

01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:33.880
So like the eights and nines had the card cut differently

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.600
and those are important cards in this game,

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:36.800
the eights and nines or whatever.

01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.440
So you could essentially, from looking at the back

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.520
of the card, discern what it's gonna be.

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:45.720
You do nothing in terms of like cheating yourself.

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:46.560
You're not rigging the game.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:48.040
All you're doing is taking advantage of the fact

01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.280
that you're playing, you've offered me cards

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.840
that are faulty.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.880
Can I just say that, of course it would be Phil Ivey,

01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:57.440
who's the goat at the normal game

01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.480
who would figure out this particular thing.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:01.360
I mean, that's what, if you're into soccer,

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.440
this Diego Maradona has that famous hand of God

01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:07.240
where he scores a goal with his hand.

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.120
And so of course the referee didn't see it.

01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:11.360
They thought it was a header.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:14.360
So, I mean, part of the magic of the genius

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:15.560
of the people at the top of the game

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:20.560
is they're able to exploit all the flaws that are there.

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:21.440
That's a beautiful thing to say.

01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:24.240
Well, see, Phil had, you know, in his heyday,

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.120
he had exploited weaknesses in casinos, you know,

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:31.040
systems all over the country.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040
Like in one night, I don't know if you know the story,

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:35.640
in one night he would take a plane, a private plane,

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:38.760
and fly to 30 different casinos all over the country

01:55:38.760 --> 01:55:40.200
because he would have these deals where they're like,

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.760
all right, we've got this big rich sucker

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:43.120
who's going to come here and play craps

01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:44.240
and he's going to lose all our money.

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:46.040
So he'd have this deal with one of the casinos

01:55:46.040 --> 01:55:47.560
where they'd be like, all right,

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:50.560
you get 20% back up to half a million, right?

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.040
So if you lose half a million, we'll give you back 100K.

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:56.200
Okay, so he'd go to one casino in Tunica,

01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.240
he'd play half a million, win or lose, you know,

01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:01.080
he would leave.

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.440
They think they're going to get him to stay,

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.040
they get him a big room, whatever.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.920
So let's say he goes to Tunica, he loses half a million, okay?

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.800
Now he goes, he flies to Atlantic City,

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.200
he wins half a million, okay?

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.560
He lost half a million and won half a million,

01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.240
but he got 100,000 back.

01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.480
So he's actually plus 100,000.

01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.960
Do that at 10 casinos a night,

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.920
you're making a million dollars in free equity.

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:21.520
And they would give him promotional chips

01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.680
and all these kinds of things

01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:24.240
and free flights and stuff like that.

01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.320
So he took advantage of the image, you know,

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.280
that they're trying to exploit.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.720
So this is why I don't have any empathy for these casinos

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:32.160
because they're giving you free drinks, they're giving you,

01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:33.240
why do you think they're doing that?

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:34.720
Kind of the kindness of their heart?

01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:36.160
They're trying to exploit you.

01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.080
So guess what?

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:39.640
You lost at your own game, pay the piper.

01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:40.640
And I think it was crazy

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:43.120
because the judges in his case said,

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.480
he did not cheat, but yeah, well, it's probably not right.

01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.360
Hold on.

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.880
You just said he didn't cheat.

01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:52.520
You know, that should be the end of the case.

01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.600
And then the casinos do the funny thing.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:56.200
I mentioned to you, I was just at the UFC

01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.960
and Dana White is a huge gambler.

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.520
He's a blackjack gambler.

01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.280
And there's that famous situation

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:05.800
where you got kicked out of a casino

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:07.040
and the casinos do that kind of thing.

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.520
When you went too much.

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:10.920
So he won some ridiculous amount of money.

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:15.040
He bets like, I mean, he plays like millions of dollars

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:16.640
on hands of blackjack, it's insane.

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:19.440
And so he won really big and he got kicked out.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:20.520
Was he counting?

01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:21.640
No, no, he wasn't counting.

01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.680
So counting in blackjack here in Las Vegas

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:24.920
is like the only game

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.840
where they actually can ask you not to play.

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:28.880
So like, basically if you're counting cards, right?

01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:30.400
You could potentially have an edge in blackjack

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:31.920
and there are some professionals who do that,

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:33.520
but they get caught pretty quickly.

01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.720
And then they say, you can play craps,

01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:35.560
you can play whatever you want,

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:36.800
but you can't play blackjack here anymore.

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:38.960
No, I think, I don't think Dana White is counting.

01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:40.240
I think he was winning a lot.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.640
I guess they can claim that they believe you're counting

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.040
because how do you really know if you're counting?

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:47.120
Well, they easily, they figured out.

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:48.280
So basically they have an eye in the sky

01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:49.240
and they can see.

01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:51.000
So if you're varying your bet size, right?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.800
So there's certain spots where based on the cards

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.600
that are out, let's say for example,

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:57.680
a lot of the twos, threes and fours and fives

01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:58.680
have been coming out.

01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.720
So the deck is rich in face cards.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:03.600
That's very good for the player, right?

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:06.840
So imagine you were betting 500 bucks

01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:10.000
and then all of a sudden you up your bet to 2000 or 5000

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.080
when the deck is rich.

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:12.960
They know when the deck is rich in high cards

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.720
because they keep a counter themselves.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.280
So if they notice a player increasing their bet sizes

01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:20.240
when the deck is good for them, it's a telltale sign.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.080
Interesting.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:22.720
I don't think Dana White would be counting.

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:24.440
So casinos don't kick you out.

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:26.160
If you don't often kick you out,

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:28.640
do they ever kick you out if you make too much money?

01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.600
Because you're playing millions of dollars.

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.240
Unless they would never kick you out

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:33.080
for making too much money.

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.240
Unless they suspect cheating, because why would they?

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:36.200
They have an advantage.

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:37.440
They want the money back.

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.600
It's not like you go in there and win 10 million.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:40.080
You're like, oh no, that's enough for us.

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:41.960
What about if he was talking shit the whole time?

01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.800
I wonder.

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.880
I don't think that would matter.

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:48.080
Because in the long run, they'll get the money back.

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:48.920
Exactly.

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:54.560
You tweeted, if you watch Jersey Shore,

01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:57.400
family vacation, we would probably get along really well.

01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:59.920
What is it about, because I lived in Jersey for a while,

01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:03.400
what is it about Jersey Shore characters that you love?

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.600
I just love that they're sort of, I love the debauchery.

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:08.920
I think Pauly D's a fun guy, you know?

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:11.080
And just like, it's just something like,

01:59:11.080 --> 01:59:13.600
it's just, it's, what do you call it?

01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.720
It's trash TV, it's a guilty pleasure.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:17.560
But you can just watch Snooki get drunk

01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:20.280
and fall in all over herself or whatever.

01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:23.440
Is that part, do you love that part of Vegas as well?

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.320
Not really, like I don't go out and stuff.

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:27.040
But I kind of, I just like the characters.

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:30.080
I like that they have unique personalities.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:32.440
And I think we live in a world now

01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:36.560
where people are more and more careful of what they say

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.480
and afraid of backlash and all that stuff.

01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:41.560
And it's kind of like an old school version of just like,

01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:43.240
say what you feel, it's okay,

01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:44.920
as long as your intent is good.

01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:49.920
And they haven't been canceled, if you will,

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:53.440
which is good, but I feel like their type of behavior,

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.600
slowly but surely, because they got a lot of flack

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:59.840
originally for misrepresenting like Italian Americans

01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:00.680
or something like that.

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.040
Like there was a lot of backlash about,

02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.960
this isn't how Italian Americans really are

02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:05.000
and blah, blah, blah.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:08.760
So they sort of were representing that group of people.

02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:12.120
And they received some backlash back in the day.

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.840
I'm a huge supporter of diversity

02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:17.400
in all the beautiful forms

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:20.040
that the human species is able to generate.

02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:22.040
And that's certainly one dimension.

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:25.200
What's the greatest Vegas movie, would you say?

02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:26.520
I don't know if that's a difficult question,

02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:28.720
but Fear of Loathing Las Vegas,

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:30.560
Leaving Las Vegas, Casino.

02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:32.600
I watch, because anytime Casino's on randomly,

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:33.760
I always watch it.

02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.000
Such a great movie.

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:38.080
It could be one of the, Sharon Stone.

02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.360
Sharon, frankly, Sharon Stone reminded me,

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:42.320
every time I would watch the movie,

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:45.640
it reminded me of my wife, Amanda, totally.

02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.360
I would see the character and I was like,

02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:49.440
I'm the Robert De Niro character in the film.

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:51.640
It was, I used to watch it through that lens.

02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:57.200
From like the depth of love that you have?

02:00:57.200 --> 02:01:00.560
Just kind of, she was, I remember that she was like,

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.840
she lit up every room.

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.520
She does light up every room when she goes there.

02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:05.560
Everybody's attracted and drawn to her.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.160
And she was kind of, when she was younger,

02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:09.200
she was a little wild and crazy and whatnot.

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.600
So she reminded me of the Sharon Stone character.

02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:13.880
And then the Robert De Niro character's trying to like,

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:17.040
have a stable life and be that, that was me.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.000
Who's the Joe Petschie in your life?

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:19.840
Well, there was a guy named,

02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.120
there was a James Woods for sure,

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.560
who was the Lester.

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:24.880
We called him, we actually called him Lester.

02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:26.720
A few of my friends call him Lester.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:31.400
The greasy guy who tried to get back in and all that.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.240
But yeah.

02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:33.720
Yeah, one of my favorite scenes is when they meet out

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:36.640
in the desert and it's like a 50, 50 odds

02:01:36.640 --> 02:01:38.400
if you're going to make it out alive in that.

02:01:38.400 --> 02:01:39.920
I mean, there, yeah, that,

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.440
there's an epicness to that portrayal of Vegas.

02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:45.400
I love, I mean, it's just totally,

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.800
I mean, it's obviously more corporate now

02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:49.480
and it's different, but I love those movies.

02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.480
I love all those movies, just seeing that life.

02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:53.120
And like I said, if there was a period at the time

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:55.400
that I could go back to and just experience it,

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:56.800
it would be, you know, right around then.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:58.080
That would be that.

02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.240
We were playing with a mob.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:02.000
I think of like these crime shows today,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.040
like they're so unrealistic now

02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:06.640
because if they're in an era that is now,

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:08.280
like none of this stuff can happen

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.680
because there's cameras everywhere.

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:11.040
You can't like get away with these,

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:13.680
like killing somebody and jumping in a car

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:15.880
and you're going to get caught, you know?

02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:18.240
But in the seventies, you know, that stuff happens.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:19.640
You cross the line, you die.

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:20.480
Yeah, Lake Mead.

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:22.880
Lake Mead is recently like losing water

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:24.320
and like every couple of days,

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.800
they're finding more and more bodies from that era.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:27.640
Oh, no.

02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.320
They really are.

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.880
You're close with your mom.

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:33.360
What did you learn about life from your mom?

02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:35.080
My mother was very generous.

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:39.960
My mother, she experienced joy through giving people food,

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:40.800
for the most part.

02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:42.120
My dad would get him drinks

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.640
and that was how she felt fulfilled, right?

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:47.480
She felt good when she like would cook for you.

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:49.400
And like she'd be that person you'd come over

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:50.760
and she'd be like, are you hungry?

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:51.960
And you'd say, no, no, no, I'm okay.

02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.880
She's going to put 15 things in front of you

02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:55.600
and you'll eat, you know, you're going to eat

02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:56.840
because everyone does that to be polite.

02:02:56.840 --> 02:02:57.760
No, no, I'm good.

02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:59.560
But you know, they will start to eat

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:01.520
and just her hospitality in that regard

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:04.440
and just being generous and like being a good host

02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:06.320
to people and things like that, like.

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.960
How did that define, like help define

02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:13.080
who you are as a person, that generosity?

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:13.920
Yeah.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:14.760
Did it rub off on you?

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.480
It made me think about in my life,

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:21.560
when it comes to like any sort of business deals

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:22.400
or things like that,

02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.960
I don't want to get the best of it

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.640
in such a way where I screw the other person.

02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:26.960
I genuinely don't.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:29.440
I'd much rather you owe me than me owe you.

02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.120
So if I hire people,

02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:33.160
they get paid more than they're supposed to.

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:36.040
And I'd rather them do that and work towards it

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:37.240
rather than feel underpaid.

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:39.520
Cause if they're underpaid, they'll likely under deliver.

02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:41.200
Whereas if they feel overpaid,

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:43.320
then if I need them to do something special,

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.160
they're not going to be like,

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:45.280
Hey, I don't get paid for that.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.760
Like, yeah, you do.

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:47.600
You really do.

02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:49.880
So that's certainly like played out in my life

02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:53.120
where I set it up in such a way where I don't owe,

02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.640
you know, I'm owed, but that's okay.

02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.640
I'd, cause I can handle taking the worst of it in spots.

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.880
I don't like being the person to, you know,

02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.360
feel like I'm indebted to others.

02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:05.520
Yeah. And in some way,

02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:08.640
the karma of that tends to pay dividends

02:04:08.640 --> 02:04:10.200
in the longterm somehow.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:15.120
Somehow there's somebody up there

02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.600
that's keeping track in some kind of way.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:20.480
What advice would you give to young people today

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:22.280
in high school and college,

02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.240
how to have a career they can be proud of,

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.320
or maybe how to have a life in general

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:28.920
they can be proud of?

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.120
I would say like your twenties is a good opportunity

02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:34.920
to set yourself up for the rest of your life, right?

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.200
So while the twenties are a period where you want to have fun

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:40.440
and you want to experience youth,

02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.400
it's also a good opportunity to start thinking about

02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.840
what do you want your life to look like

02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.840
in your thirties and your forties, right?

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.680
So I feel like it's the best time

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.200
to really put yourself out there and take risks

02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:54.000
and try to hit it, you know, whatever, you know,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.400
like to work really, really hard to set yourself up.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:59.880
Because, and I said this at an event I was speaking at,

02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:01.040
when you're like with poker,

02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:02.480
when your bankroll is very, very small,

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.120
it's replenishable, right?

02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.960
You don't need to protect it as much

02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:09.360
as you do once you've got something, right?

02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:11.160
Once you have a brand or you have money

02:05:11.160 --> 02:05:12.560
and you have something like that,

02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:14.040
that's when you want to start protecting it.

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:15.560
But in your twenties is an opportunity

02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:18.120
to just really sort of get, you know,

02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:21.280
to work really, really hard to set yourself up,

02:05:21.280 --> 02:05:22.120
you know, for the future.

02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.280
I am concerned a little bit,

02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:24.600
like every time I talk to kids today,

02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:26.080
I'm like, what do you want to be?

02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:30.160
They all want to be YouTubers or Instagram stars or rappers,

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:31.000
right?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.480
Like, okay, it was like, that's cool,

02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:34.360
but like there's only so many of those, you know,

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:35.360
that there can be.

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.320
So it might be worthwhile

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.040
having a little bit of a backup plan.

02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.640
I think it's easier to be successful on Instagram

02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:43.200
and social media if you do something else.

02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.720
And I would say this too.

02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:47.000
One other thing I would say is,

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.680
don't choose a profession or an idea

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:54.040
because you think it'll make you rich, right?

02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:56.600
Pursue something that you actually love.

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:58.160
Because if you love it,

02:05:58.160 --> 02:05:59.600
you're way more likely to become rich.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.320
If you don't, you do something

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:03.000
that you don't actually enjoy.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.480
Now you're spending a lot of your life unhappy

02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:06.720
doing something you don't want.

02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.800
And if you're not passionate about it,

02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:09.640
you're probably not,

02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.280
the chances of you being successful are much lower.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:14.040
And also becoming rich.

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:15.800
And I've talked to a lot of rich people,

02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:17.440
hang out with a lot of rich people

02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:21.480
is not going to be as fulfilling as you imagine.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:22.640
If you arrive there

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.760
by not doing the thing that you love doing.

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:25.600
That's true.

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:28.840
Ultimately the thing that you love doing is like,

02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:30.360
that's what makes life worth it.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:31.280
There's another quote,

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:32.280
I can't remember who it was,

02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:33.120
otherwise I would quote the,

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:35.160
but it says something to the effect of like,

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:39.680
if we believe in the lie that more is always better,

02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:41.680
then we can never truly arrive.

02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:44.520
Because wherever we are, more is better, right?

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.760
I've never understood and I've been around rich people.

02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:50.360
Like, you said, I never got, I don't get it.

02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.000
Like if you have a billion dollars,

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.720
why do you give a shit about money at all?

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.720
Like, and they're still like, oh, we made this deal.

02:06:56.720 --> 02:06:59.480
And I'm like, we picked up 300, who cares?

02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.520
Like your life is set.

02:07:01.160 --> 02:07:03.080
There is that bell curve, right?

02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:05.280
Where obviously being in poverty,

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:07.360
there's obviously a high rate of unhappiness,

02:07:07.360 --> 02:07:10.000
but there's a certain amount of money where you reach,

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
where you reach a level of happiness.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.360
And then too much, you find that people

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.440
that are searching for money to fulfill these holes,

02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.520
it starts to go back down again.

02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:21.560
Well, getting more money could become a game,

02:07:21.560 --> 02:07:23.560
like a sport that's fun to play,

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:27.360
as long as you directly or indirectly acknowledge

02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.520
that what you love is the game of it,

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.080
versus the actual attainment of money.

02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:32.680
And I think that's what it is, right?

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:34.680
For me, I've never cared about money that much.

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:35.520
I just never did.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.360
Otherwise I would have a lot more of it.

02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.120
But it's always like, it's always been strange to me

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:42.240
how people that have that kind of money

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:45.840
like are cheap in any way, you know?

02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:48.960
Like they wouldn't donate 5,000 to a worthwhile charity.

02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:52.440
Cause it's like, buddy, like when it changes your life,

02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.520
not even like small things like taxes,

02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:57.480
like, okay, you have $20 billion

02:07:57.480 --> 02:08:00.720
and you're worried about paying 33%, 30% to 31.

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:03.520
I get it, I get the point of it all,

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:06.960
but like it literally has no effect on your life whatsoever.

02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:10.280
Your life is unchanged, whether it's 31 or 33.

02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.920
Yeah, that's the negative of a lot of money

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:14.840
is if it corrupts the way you see the world,

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:16.560
you start to be protective and so on.

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.320
I mean, part of the challenge of when you get a lot of money

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.280
is people start to treat you differently.

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.840
And so navigating that correctly is very challenging.

02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:25.960
So don't change.

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:30.000
Remain the same person you always were.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.040
Cause if you change, you start to,

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.760
I mean, that's why power corrupts

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:36.040
is you get a lot of power, you get a lot of fame,

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:37.880
you get a lot of money.

02:08:37.880 --> 02:08:40.160
You start to distrust people.

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.880
You start to push away people

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.200
that are actually really close to you with trust.

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:46.160
You develop some biases where you think like,

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:49.400
you're just this, you know, you think like it was all you

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.040
and you're a genius and you're so great

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:52.480
and all these other people who don't have,

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.080
it's just cause they don't have what you have.

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:56.160
And like, you just, then you start to like view

02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:58.040
that group of people, whether they're impoverished

02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.240
or whatever is like less than,

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:01.640
and that you're some like great guru

02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:04.040
where you could have just got lucky and bought bitcoins

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:05.440
that, you know, could have done anything.

02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:07.480
And then you became like super wealthy.

02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:10.120
And then you have this like Dunning-Kruger effect

02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.760
where you think you know everything about everything.

02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:12.920
And a lot of poker people have that.

02:09:12.920 --> 02:09:15.760
And I, listen, I'm probably guilty in some ways too.

02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.600
You know, thinking because you can figure out poker

02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:18.560
and be, you know, great at that,

02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:20.160
that you could figure out anything.

02:09:20.160 --> 02:09:21.400
So there's like, it's true, right?

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.160
I mean, we sort of, we genuinely feel like

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:25.600
people that reach the highest levels of poker

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.160
feel like they are intelligent.

02:09:27.160 --> 02:09:28.400
So they will look at problem solving

02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.080
and think that they have answers.

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:32.800
Well, you have to remind yourself that you're not,

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.440
as best to see the world as you did just get lucky,

02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:37.040
or at least from my perspective,

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:38.360
that you're not better than anybody.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.160
I don't think there's anything wrong with like acknowledging

02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:41.960
that you worked hard to get where you were.

02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:43.480
Like there isn't, but at the same time,

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.120
like it's not available to everybody in the same way,

02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:47.400
you know, right time, right place.

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:48.920
Like for me, my poker career could have gone

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.480
very differently, you know?

02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:52.280
If things didn't work out, you know,

02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.360
if I had some bad luck in the wrong times,

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:56.040
like who knows where I'd be.

02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:59.800
So you said your brain crawl is pretty small in your 20s.

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:01.680
I'm sure you've been around a lot of people

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:04.680
you care a lot about who've lost everything in poker.

02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:05.920
What's that like?

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:09.240
What's those low points of losing everything?

02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:12.000
I think because I've been there,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.560
I have more empathy than I probably should for those people

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:16.440
that really feel for them.

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:18.920
Cause I remember being in Vegas and being totally broke

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:21.680
and like a guy loaning me $400

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:24.200
and me like turning that 400 into 20,000.

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.320
400 bucks and it was like eternally grateful of that.

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.520
So when I have friends who go through that,

02:10:29.520 --> 02:10:32.200
like I always try to consult them, obviously,

02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:34.680
but they really need his money for the most part.

02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:36.440
But I remember saying no to one friend

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:37.720
because he didn't have a plan.

02:10:37.720 --> 02:10:39.800
So I like to try to help them in that regard.

02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:42.240
Like my buddy's like, can you stake me in this game?

02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:43.880
And I was like, all right, well, how much do you,

02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:45.720
then I was like, let's break down the math, bro.

02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:46.560
You want me to stake you,

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:48.720
so you get 50% of the profit, right?

02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:50.440
So I said, how much do you think you can make in this game?

02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.160
How much does the biggest winners make?

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:53.640
He's like, well, I can probably,

02:10:53.640 --> 02:10:56.280
I'd probably do like 20,000 a month in this game.

02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.120
So, okay.

02:10:57.120 --> 02:10:58.960
So you get half of that cause I get 10, right?

02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.920
What is your monthly nut?

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:00.760
How much are you spending?

02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:03.400
He's like, well, I'm renting this thing for 8,000.

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.920
You're spending 17,000 a month.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:09.480
So like, no matter what you're set up to fail.

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.880
Like this isn't gonna work.

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.160
So I actually didn't give him the money.

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:13.920
And I was like, what you need to do to earn more money

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:16.120
is lower your monthly nut because it's too high.

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:19.160
It just doesn't mathematically add up.

02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:21.520
So trying to set them right in that regard

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.680
is something that like I feel obliged to do,

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.520
especially if they're friends.

02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:27.600
But what about the mental aspect of the struggle

02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:28.440
they're going through,

02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:30.040
the struggle you were going through?

02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:34.400
Just, I mean, it's really rough to have no money.

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.520
It's not for everybody.

02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.360
This really isn't.

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:37.720
Like a lot of people might, you know, listen to this

02:11:37.720 --> 02:11:38.800
and think like, oh, I wanna play poker.

02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.580
It's like most people fail.

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:43.920
Most people who wanna play in the NFL,

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:46.320
they spend their college years,

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.520
like most of them are not gonna make it.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.440
Most of you who try to play poker professionally

02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:53.800
are going to fail and you're gonna experience despair, okay?

02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:55.400
There are those, like in anything,

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.840
that have the passion, have the know-how,

02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.280
have the luck and all that sort of stuff

02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.680
and it all pans out.

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:01.640
But, you know, they're the minority.

02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:06.480
And so for the low points, if you remember,

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:08.740
what does it take to sort of overcome that,

02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:12.320
overcome the mental struggle?

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:13.800
I mean, you're making it sound like certain people

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:15.520
are just genetically able to in certain.

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.400
I do think some people are more apt

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.280
to being able to deal with like adversity

02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:20.120
and having resilience.

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:21.600
Some people just can't hack it.

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.360
But like I generally, what I would advise,

02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.760
you know, people that are, let's say a guy's playing,

02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.480
you know, really high stakes or whatever,

02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:29.640
doing badly is step number one is take a little bit

02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:32.160
of a break here, let's recalibrate

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.760
and let's start small again.

02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:36.120
Let's, you know, let's restart and let's play smaller stakes

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:37.680
and let's get our confidence back

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:40.000
because in poker without confidence,

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:41.660
you cannot be successful.

02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.800
It is incredibly important to have almost an inflated

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:46.880
level of confidence in yourself

02:12:46.880 --> 02:12:48.820
because you're up against it, right?

02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.460
As I said, the majority of people fail.

02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:51.500
So why are you special?

02:12:51.500 --> 02:12:52.540
Why are you different?

02:12:52.540 --> 02:12:54.940
You have to be pretty confident about yourself

02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.580
to think that you are one of the chosen ones.

02:12:57.580 --> 02:13:01.660
And then don't resist the despair and take a nap.

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:03.780
Definitely take a nap.

02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:05.780
Listen, it's okay to experience it, like I said, yeah.

02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:06.820
You're gonna experience the spirit.

02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:09.300
What else would you, what should you be feeling?

02:13:09.300 --> 02:13:10.420
You know, if things are going poorly

02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:11.440
and you just lost all your money.

02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:12.860
Excited?

02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:15.900
Maybe like, okay, have your moment of grief.

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:18.340
Allow yourself to experience it so that you can,

02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:20.540
you know, reassemble.

02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:22.700
There's a fundamental way in which you haven't really

02:13:22.700 --> 02:13:27.200
lived life if you haven't experienced periods of despair.

02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:30.100
You have a jaded view of the world, right?

02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:31.900
Weird thing about the human condition

02:13:31.900 --> 02:13:35.300
that both the highs and the lows are important.

02:13:35.300 --> 02:13:36.140
Yeah.

02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:40.780
What role does love play in the human condition?

02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:41.620
Daniel Negrano.

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.660
Ooh, that's a good one.

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:47.060
What role has love played in your life?

02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.620
Yeah, that's, you know, you sort of talked about

02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:54.620
the ups and downs of, you know, the human condition.

02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:56.900
And love has been that for me, right?

02:13:56.900 --> 02:13:58.540
Yeah.

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.900
Like I'm in a good place now, but you know,

02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:05.900
even with my now wife, years ago, you know, she was young.

02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:07.900
She was, you know, new to poker

02:14:07.900 --> 02:14:09.240
and she wasn't ready to settle down.

02:14:09.240 --> 02:14:12.460
I was like, when I met her, I think I was 31, she was 21.

02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:15.620
And I was ready to like lock her up, if you will, you know?

02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:16.440
Let's do this.

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:17.840
And I bought a ring way back when.

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:19.200
She was like, not about that.

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:21.000
She was living the Hollywood life.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.320
She was living, you know, partying in LA,

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.920
doing that kind of stuff and wasn't ready.

02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:27.280
And we split and that one hit me hard.

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:31.160
So I didn't realize how much of a hit

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:35.280
that had on my confidence in my, in everything, really.

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:36.640
In poker, with other women,

02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:39.700
it had me a little jaded about women too, you know?

02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:42.080
Resentful, you know?

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.320
And it took a lot of like self-retro.

02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:45.800
I did like a lot of personal growth work

02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.760
and workshops and things like that.

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.880
And then didn't see her for years.

02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:51.800
When she came back to town, I was a much different person.

02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:54.200
It was, you know, four years ago or something like that.

02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.760
And she was too, went to dinner.

02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.760
A few months later, we were married.

02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:01.500
It worked out so different because we both had to grow,

02:15:01.500 --> 02:15:03.720
you know, and become different people.

02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:05.520
And that love was still there somehow.

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.580
Yeah, like she went through her relationships.

02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:09.960
I went through mine, you know, we experienced life.

02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.920
And I was married once before too, you know,

02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920
called my starter marriage, if you will.

02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.040
You know, we just, you don't know.

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:21.200
I think like until you do it, until you get married

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.600
and, you know, experience like the sacrifice,

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.800
not necessarily the sacrifices, but your value systems.

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.080
If they don't align identically,

02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:29.160
which they're not going to,

02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:32.860
someone like me, probably one of my strengths in poker,

02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:36.120
but my weaknesses in relationship is judgment, right?

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:37.920
When I play poker, I need to judge you.

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.340
That's essentially what I'm doing.

02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:42.040
I'm gauging who you are and what you're good at

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:43.160
and what you're bad at.

02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.160
And that can have repercussions because it leads,

02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:46.520
that's how I, you know,

02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:48.620
that's the lens I look at everyone with,

02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:49.680
based on how you live your life.

02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:51.360
I'm judging you, this guy's this, this guy's that,

02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:52.200
this guy's that.

02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.280
And that's not healthy.

02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:54.800
So you have to shut that off.

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:55.620
You have to learn to like-

02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:56.460
In personal relationships.

02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:58.000
And the thing, I finally realized what love is,

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.960
frankly for me, with her, is no judgment, right?

02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:02.800
Yeah, acceptance.

02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.920
So like, yeah, so I have my way of being, right?

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.960
If she wants to have cereal for dinner,

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.600
babe, that's the best decision for her.

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:11.280
I was living in a framework of better and worse.

02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.940
The way that I do things is better and yours is worse.

02:16:13.940 --> 02:16:15.560
Do things more like I do.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.400
That's a recipe for disaster.

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.840
True acceptance and true love is accepting someone

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:21.440
like exactly as they are.

02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:23.200
You know, if she wants to do something different,

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:25.060
I'm gonna support her, whatever it is.

02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:26.640
Even if I disagree with it personally

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.560
and like the way that I would do things,

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:31.400
learning to just realize that she's had a different journey

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:34.280
and a different walk towards where she's at than I have.

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:37.480
So I can't pass my judgments on other people like that.

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:39.360
I believe it is ethically wrong

02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:42.000
and probably illegal to eat cereal for dinner.

02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:45.640
Listen, if she wants it, she wants it.

02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:46.800
Acceptance.

02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:47.880
Like when she goes to bed,

02:16:47.880 --> 02:16:50.040
like all these little things about my regimented life,

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:50.880
she's not.

02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:53.720
Like our motto at our wedding was like,

02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:56.700
you keep me wild, I'll keep you safe, you keep me wild.

02:16:56.700 --> 02:16:59.000
I keep her safe, she keeps me wild.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.080
She's like not organized and anal

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.940
and all those kinds of things, I am.

02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:06.160
She helps me like let loose.

02:17:06.160 --> 02:17:07.560
You know, oh no, I'm eating this, this,

02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.040
she's like, have some popcorn.

02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:10.560
All right, let's do it.

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:12.560
You know, she keeps me freed.

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:14.780
And accepting that, embracing that,

02:17:14.780 --> 02:17:17.720
the difference is the chaos of it.

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:18.560
Yeah.

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:19.380
That's what makes it.

02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:21.080
Like I literally do think about with her,

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:23.440
how important it is and how much I try to like

02:17:24.900 --> 02:17:28.240
just come from neutral and like compassion and never judge

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.400
because she's got other things that she deals with, right?

02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.940
That I don't, she's bipolar, right?

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:35.840
So with that, I've studied and I've learned a lot about,

02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.860
you know, sort of mental health and what that means.

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:42.860
And ways in which a lot of characteristics

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:45.740
about somebody is completely out of their control

02:17:45.740 --> 02:17:47.380
when they're bipolar, right?

02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:49.340
And there's swings, like there's no,

02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:53.820
there's no cocktail for bipolar that solves the issue, right?

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:55.740
So there's medications that work to, you know,

02:17:55.740 --> 02:17:57.660
level you out for periods of time,

02:17:57.660 --> 02:17:59.540
but then they start to fade and they don't work as well.

02:17:59.540 --> 02:18:01.540
So they constantly need readjustment.

02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:04.020
It's an unsolved mystery to a certain degree.

02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:07.220
So in some sense, you know,

02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:11.180
her diagnosis made our relationship easier

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:13.540
because I don't take anything personal, right?

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:16.140
I realized that sometimes she's going to be in a mood

02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:18.060
and say, you know,

02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.780
she's so good about communicating it though.

02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:22.060
She tells me some morning she'll be like bad mood,

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:23.100
trying to get out of it, babe.

02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:24.820
I'm like, okay, so I leave her alone.

02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:25.660
Well, that's great.

02:18:25.660 --> 02:18:27.620
That means she's grown to be able to communicate,

02:18:27.620 --> 02:18:29.980
to understand, to self-reflect, to understand where she is.

02:18:29.980 --> 02:18:32.940
I have people in my life who I love who are bipolar.

02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:34.060
It's a beautiful ride.

02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:35.140
It is, right?

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.700
Yeah, it's, yeah.

02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:38.820
The highs and the lows are like, are there.

02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.380
So, but yeah, like, because I,

02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:41.580
like I feel like protect her.

02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:44.420
For me, I just want to be a rock, right?

02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:45.940
And that's part of the whole cereal thing.

02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.820
If she wants to eat cereal,

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.580
don't make a wrong for anything she wants to do.

02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:52.140
What have you learned from life,

02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:55.700
from the song, The Gambler by Kenny Rogers?

02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:57.180
You gotta know when to hold them,

02:18:57.180 --> 02:18:58.740
know when to fold them,

02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:01.580
know when to walk away, know when to run.

02:19:01.580 --> 02:19:02.780
You never count your money

02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:04.140
when you're sitting at the table.

02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:05.620
There'll be plenty of time for counting

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:06.860
when the dealings done.

02:19:06.860 --> 02:19:08.940
Is that, do you live by those words?

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.860
The first part of it for sure.

02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:12.620
What did they even mean?

02:19:12.620 --> 02:19:15.380
You got to know when to hold, know when.

02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:17.580
So basically it's like, all right, you know, in life,

02:19:17.580 --> 02:19:19.940
like, you know, let's say, let's use a,

02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:21.620
whatever, the market, for example.

02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:23.140
You bought a stock, right?

02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:24.340
Or you bought Bitcoin and you're like,

02:19:24.340 --> 02:19:26.420
it's gonna go to the moon, right?

02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:29.580
It's like, okay, well, maybe things have changed.

02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:31.420
New scenario, new circumstances,

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:33.100
new situation.

02:19:33.100 --> 02:19:34.860
Are you going down with the ship, right?

02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:36.100
Or are you gonna lay the hand down?

02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.100
Are you gonna fold it?

02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:38.780
Whether it's a relationship, you know?

02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:41.180
You're with this woman, you're like, all right,

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.020
I think it's time to fold this one.

02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:45.500
I think, you know, I don't think that we're gonna be able

02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:47.780
to make this hand work right now.

02:19:47.780 --> 02:19:49.780
When to fold them and when to run.

02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:50.620
Yeah, when to run.

02:19:50.620 --> 02:19:54.180
So maybe every gambler knows that the secret to surviving

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:56.860
is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep.

02:19:56.860 --> 02:19:59.740
Because every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.

02:19:59.740 --> 02:20:01.180
That's like a stoic philosophy.

02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:04.980
And the best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep.

02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:09.260
Every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser.

02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:10.380
What does that mean?

02:20:10.380 --> 02:20:11.220
I like that one.

02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.020
I like, for me, that's like the difference

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:14.380
between victim and responsible.

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:16.140
Like the way that I think about it, right?

02:20:16.140 --> 02:20:18.140
You can be a victim to circumstance

02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:20.420
or you can be responsible for everything in your life, right?

02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:22.060
So when an event happens,

02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:24.860
the event itself is neither good or bad

02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:27.420
until you assign it value, right?

02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:30.780
So like an event happens and can be traumatic.

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.860
It can be painful, but how you respond to it

02:20:33.860 --> 02:20:35.580
is ultimately gonna be up to you.

02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:36.820
Like you actually do have a choice.

02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:39.020
And that's the thing you can control.

02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:41.140
The fact that you, Daniel Negrano,

02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:44.020
took my commentary about the gambler seriously

02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:46.580
shows once more that you're a beautiful human being.

02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:49.380
Thank you so much for being who you are,

02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:51.820
for inspiring millions of people about poker,

02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:52.940
about how to live life.

02:20:52.940 --> 02:20:55.420
And thank you for giving me your valuable time today.

02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:56.260
This is amazing.

02:20:56.260 --> 02:20:57.100
Thanks for talking. It was fun, man.

02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:58.940
It was great to have the conversation.

02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:01.260

And now let me leave you with some words from Doyle Bronson.

02:21:11.420 --> 02:21:13.580
Poker is war.

02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.580
People pretend it is a game.

02:21:16.460 --> 02:21:19.140
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
