00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
I'm here with MrBeast, the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever

00:05.320 --> 00:06.320
created.

00:06.320 --> 00:09.480
Do you think you'll ever make a video that gets one billion views?

00:09.480 --> 00:13.640
I think maybe one of the videos we've already made might get a billion views.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.640
Which one do you think?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.600
Probably like the squid game video with enough time.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.680
I mean, it's only a year old and it's already on 300 million or some of the newer ones we've

00:20.680 --> 00:23.760
done have gotten like 100 million views in a month.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.760
So those four projected over 10 years because YouTube's not going anywhere.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.760
Probably one of those.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.240
And they don't necessarily plateau.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
It's interesting.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.520
We're literally jumping right in.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.520
I love it.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.520
It's good.

00:34.520 --> 00:39.880
So I'm a firm believer that it's much easier to hypothetically get 10 million views on

00:39.880 --> 00:42.640
one video than a hundred thousand on a hundred.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.880
And part of why it's much easier in my opinion is like, if you make a really good video,

00:45.880 --> 00:50.760
it's just so evergreen and it never dies because YouTube, when you open up YouTube and look

00:50.760 --> 00:54.520
at the videos, they're just serving you whatever they think you'll like the best, you know?

00:54.520 --> 00:59.480
And so if you just make a great video and it's constantly just above every other video,

00:59.480 --> 01:03.880
you know, even two years down the road, then they'll just keep serving it and never stop,

01:03.880 --> 01:07.200
you know, which is why it's much easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
ones.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.240
What about one billion subscribers?

01:10.240 --> 01:14.480
You've passed PewDiePie's and most subscribed to YouTube channel.

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
When do you think you get a billion?

01:15.480 --> 01:18.120
Let me do some math real quick.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.120
So we're on 120.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.720
So you think about this?

01:20.720 --> 01:23.120
No, I don't, honestly.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.000
I think you'll find if you want to gain subscribers, if you want to get views, if you want to make

01:27.000 --> 01:32.320
money and almost any metric in this video creation space, if you want something, it

01:32.320 --> 01:34.920
all comes back to, okay, well then just make great videos.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.440
So instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics, I just kind of focus on the

01:39.440 --> 01:42.320
one thing that gets me all that, which is make good videos.

01:42.320 --> 01:46.200
But I do think we will, when they hit a billion subscribers, I don't have a plan on going

01:46.200 --> 01:47.200
anywhere.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.800
Even though we're only on 120 million right now on the main channel, I think like we're

01:50.800 --> 01:56.080
doing around 10 million a month now and YouTube just, yeah, I just don't see it going anywhere.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.640
And I don't see any reason why I'd ever get burnt out or quit.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.760
So I think with enough time, yes.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.400
I wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before I go to the dark questions.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.600
So now we have dark questions right now, but if you wanted to hook them, you would start

02:08.600 --> 02:09.880
off with the dark question.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
That's how you get them.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
Okay.

02:11.880 --> 02:17.640
Well, let me ask you about the Twitter poll you posted, a $10,000 death poll.

02:17.640 --> 02:22.720
You tweeted, if someone offered you $10,000, but if you take it, a random person on earth

02:22.720 --> 02:26.440
dies, would you take the $10,000?

02:26.440 --> 02:32.920
And 45% of people said, yes, that's at least at the time I checked 850,000 people committing

02:32.920 --> 02:38.320
murder for just $8.5 billion in total.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.960
So what do you learn about human nature from that?

02:40.960 --> 02:42.760
That's a good question.

02:42.760 --> 02:47.000
Honestly, this is like late at night when I threw that up too, I was just like, huh,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
this will be a funny thing.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.640
I assumed it'd be 90% no and like 10% yes, but there are a lot of serious people for

02:53.640 --> 02:54.640
you guys listening.

02:54.640 --> 02:58.760
I just did this random Twitter poll where I was like, would you take 10 grand if it

02:58.760 --> 03:00.400
meant someone random in the world died?

03:00.400 --> 03:03.720
And a lot of the replies on the tweet were like, hell yeah, why not?

03:03.720 --> 03:06.480
And I was just not expecting that.

03:06.480 --> 03:07.720
And so I don't really know.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.760
I mean, I feel like your take would be better than mine.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.560
Was it disturbing to you, surprising to you?

03:11.560 --> 03:12.560
A little bit.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.560
Yeah.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.760
But you know, obviously a lot of people were trolling, but I actually, you know, when you

03:15.800 --> 03:19.840
read through those replies, I do think like 10% of them were like dead serious.

03:19.840 --> 03:25.600
Well, I think sometimes the trolling and the laws reveal a thing we're too embarrassed

03:25.600 --> 03:28.440
to admit about the darker aspects of our nature.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.040
So I don't know if you listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History podcast.

03:32.040 --> 03:38.280
He has an episode on painful attainment, which he describes throughout history, how humans

03:38.280 --> 03:41.700
have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.820
So public executions, all that kind of stuff.

03:45.820 --> 03:50.780
And he believes that's in all of us, that, for example, if something like a YouTube or

03:50.780 --> 03:58.500
a different platform streamed a public execution or streamed the torture of another human being,

03:58.500 --> 04:04.340
a lot of people would say that's deeply unethical, but they would still tune in and watch.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.860
And that we're attracted to that drama, and especially the most extreme versions of that

04:09.860 --> 04:10.860
drama.

04:11.020 --> 04:17.420
Part of the laws reveal something that's actually true in that poll that like your answer is

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
so much better than mine.

04:18.660 --> 04:20.860
Do you think about that?

04:20.860 --> 04:22.180
Maybe even with the squid game?

04:22.700 --> 04:27.220
Like, so I think how many how many views does the squid game currently have?

04:27.260 --> 04:28.820
Three hundred million. Yeah, something like this.

04:29.980 --> 04:38.620
So. Just imagine thought experiment, how many views that video would get if it was like

04:38.620 --> 04:42.940
real? Yeah, assuming YouTube was like, we'll turn a blind eye, we won't take it down.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.980
Yeah, I mean, obviously it probably have billions of views.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.980
How do you think you will die?

04:47.980 --> 04:49.340
And do you think it'll be during a video?

04:49.820 --> 04:53.860
Probably doing something dumb like going to space when I'm older, like trying to go to

04:53.860 --> 04:55.180
Mars or something like that.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.340
I know for a fact it won't be on a video.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.620
Every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.860
So it's not really risk.

05:00.860 --> 05:06.100
But yeah, I could see myself like, you know, after a million people go to Mars or something

05:06.100 --> 05:09.500
like that, I'd probably like, you know, let's go and something like that, maybe.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.980
So not in the name of a video, just for the holiday.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.340
Heck no. Are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos?

05:15.340 --> 05:16.460
You just went to Antarctica.

05:16.460 --> 05:19.060
I mean, you're you're putting yourself in the line a little bit, right?

05:19.220 --> 05:22.940
Of course. But, you know, we we had that video in the works for three years and then we

05:22.940 --> 05:25.820
consult with tons of experts radar the entire path.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.700
We're going to walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.460
So we know there's no crevasses.

05:29.460 --> 05:33.220
We do training. We consult with experts and we have survival guides there with us and,

05:33.420 --> 05:34.700
you know, monitor the weather and everything.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.220
So it's like any variable that where we could get harmed, we just pre-plan for it.

05:39.260 --> 05:40.380
Same thing with buried alive.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.660
Like I had David Blaine spent a week underground.

05:43.820 --> 05:46.980
And so I consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried

05:46.980 --> 05:50.980
themselves alive. You know, the coffin we used to bury me, we did so many tests.

05:50.980 --> 05:55.420
Like that coffin was buried 10 times before I was, you know, for way longer than 50

05:55.420 --> 05:59.140
hours. It tested the airflow and everything to the point where I was safer in that

05:59.140 --> 06:00.980
coffin underground than I was above ground.

06:00.980 --> 06:04.340
Like, so we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance, you know.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.860
Another strange question then.

06:07.740 --> 06:12.420
So you recorded these videos to yourself, you know, five years, 10 years from now.

06:12.980 --> 06:16.620
Have you recorded a video that's to be released once you die?

06:17.340 --> 06:21.220
Well, first off, I am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with

06:21.220 --> 06:24.500
like views or things like that. It's nice getting different questions.

06:24.500 --> 06:29.180
So this is this is good. No, seriously, it's a little dark, but it's fine because a

06:29.180 --> 06:31.060
lot of people just be like, how much money do you make?

06:31.060 --> 06:34.420
You know, it's just something I just everything's always about money now for when

06:34.420 --> 06:36.260
people talk to me. So it's nice.

06:37.060 --> 06:41.500
But for the videos I made for you guys who probably don't follow me too closely,

06:41.780 --> 06:45.300
when I had eight thousand subscribers and I was a teenager, I filmed a bunch of

06:45.300 --> 06:47.340
videos and scheduled them years in the future.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.140
And I said I'd film one where I was like, hi, me in a year.

06:50.140 --> 06:53.260
And the video went up a year later and it was like, hey, I think you'll have one

06:53.260 --> 06:56.140
hundred thousand subscribers. And then I did one where I was like, hi, me in five

06:56.140 --> 06:58.460
years. I was like, hey, in five years, I think you'll have a million.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.580
And then one that hasn't come out yet, but comes out in two years, is was hi, me

07:02.580 --> 07:05.620
in 10 years. And I tried to predict 10 years later how many subs I'd have.

07:05.820 --> 07:10.500
So he's referring to. And yes, there there are some that are scheduled like 20

07:10.500 --> 07:13.300
years in the future. And so if I don't die, I'll just move them up.

07:13.580 --> 07:17.340
And I remember because I filmed these, though, like seven years ago.

07:17.460 --> 07:22.460
But it was I remember saying a line like, you know, if I'm dead, then I'm currently

07:22.460 --> 07:24.540
just in a coffin and like whatever, blah, blah, blah.

07:24.540 --> 07:28.420
And because the only way the video would go up is if I'm not alive and if I'm not

07:28.420 --> 07:30.900
alive, then I won't be able to push back the schedule upload date.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.340
So we'll go public automatically.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.540
Yes. And so, yeah, I have a couple of those.

07:35.100 --> 07:40.060
Like if I knew I was going to die of like cancer or something and I had like three

07:40.060 --> 07:42.060
months to live, I would vlog every day.

07:42.060 --> 07:45.220
I filmed so many videos and then I would just schedule upload a video a week for

07:45.220 --> 07:46.220
like the next five years.

07:46.220 --> 07:49.860
So it's like I'm still alive and I would completely act like I'm still alive and

07:49.860 --> 07:52.620
everything. And I think something like that would be cool.

07:53.620 --> 07:57.300
It's I don't know why, but I fantasize about not fantasize, but I've dreamt about

07:57.300 --> 08:01.300
that a lot. Like, I don't know, if I only had 30 days to live, what would I do?

08:01.420 --> 08:04.820
And for me, I would try to make like a decade's worth of content and schedule

08:04.820 --> 08:07.060
upload it so they automatically go public in the future.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.900
And so it's just like I never died.

08:08.900 --> 08:14.300
I'm just there. Yeah, it's a kind of immortality, but it's also kind of troll on

08:14.300 --> 08:18.500
the concept of time. Yeah, you can die in the physical space, but persist in the

08:18.500 --> 08:22.500
digital space. I actually I recorded a video like that because I had

08:23.100 --> 08:28.260
some concerns and I just thought it's also a good exercise to do a video with

08:28.260 --> 08:30.300
like to be released if I die.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.260
And it was actually a really interesting exercise.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.660
It's cool. Like it shows like what you really care about.

08:35.740 --> 08:37.100
I guess it's like writing a will.

08:37.300 --> 08:39.300
Well, when you're younger, you don't think about that kind of stuff.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.580
But exactly. Mine was just dumb.

08:40.660 --> 08:42.700
Yeah, I'm bones in a coffin.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.620
Yeah, yours is probably so serious.

08:45.780 --> 08:48.900
No, it's fun. Actually, we realize it's like there's no point to be serious at

08:48.900 --> 08:51.380
this point. It's a weird thing.

08:51.380 --> 08:54.460
I guess you've done this, but it's a weird thing to address the world when you

08:54.460 --> 08:55.980
the physical use no longer there.

08:56.340 --> 09:00.020
So, like, you know, this would only be released if you're no longer there.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.500
Exactly. That's a weird exercise.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.620
You know, it's funny of all the people listening to this.

09:03.860 --> 09:07.780
You know, we're probably the only two people that have made videos for when we

09:07.780 --> 09:10.100
die. It's like such a niche thing.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.020
And the fact that we're bonding over, it's kind of funny.

09:12.220 --> 09:13.940
I think people should think about doing that.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.100
It's not just about YouTube. It's also social media.

09:16.100 --> 09:20.660
Just think about it like there's going to be a last tweet and the last, I don't

09:20.700 --> 09:22.500
know, Facebook post, the last Instagram post.

09:23.260 --> 09:30.540
And yeah, I feel like there's some aspect that's meditative to just even

09:30.540 --> 09:32.020
considering making a post like that.

09:32.260 --> 09:37.140
And also, it's a way for your the people that love you to kind of like celebrate.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.500
Do you think that would help them cope or not?

09:39.740 --> 09:43.540
Like if someone randomly watching this did film a video, you know, for if they

09:43.540 --> 09:46.340
accidentally died in some freak accident to be given to their family, do you think

09:46.340 --> 09:48.420
that would? And it was like a genuine.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.380
I think it would really help.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.980
I mean, it depends because like, how would you even intro that like, hey, mom,

09:53.180 --> 09:55.500
if you're seeing this, you know, it means I'm probably dead.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.020
Yeah, exactly. That's how you intro it.

09:57.380 --> 10:00.300
That's the opener. I just want you to know.

10:00.340 --> 10:01.700
Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

10:01.700 --> 10:05.220
And I guess you could say in a kind of funny way, but and just talk about the

10:05.220 --> 10:10.020
things that mean a lot to you, because otherwise you are at the risk of the last

10:10.020 --> 10:14.340
post you have is like, like, I don't know, talking shit about like McDonald's.

10:14.340 --> 10:15.660
McDonald's. Exactly.

10:16.420 --> 10:17.620
But then you're dead. That's it.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.700
100 years. I don't know this.

10:19.860 --> 10:24.980
I do recommend it's it's like the stoics meditate on death every day in the same

10:24.980 --> 10:28.500
way you kind of meditate on your death when you make a video like that, because

10:28.500 --> 10:31.020
it's actually not just even talking to yourself, it's talking to the world.

10:31.660 --> 10:36.180
And like, for some reason, at least for me, they made it very concrete that

10:36.180 --> 10:37.180
there's going to be an end.

10:38.060 --> 10:42.380
And I'm like, it's almost it's over for me if I'm making the video, it's over for

10:42.380 --> 10:43.980
me. It's an interesting thought experiment.

10:43.980 --> 10:46.820
I recommend people try it.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.460
OK, from are you afraid of death, by the way?

10:50.980 --> 10:58.020
Yes, I I it's hard because like, what if you just die and then you just see

10:58.020 --> 10:59.100
nothing forever?

10:59.100 --> 11:03.020
You know, it just fades to blackness and you're just like that for trillions upon

11:03.020 --> 11:05.460
trillions to billions squared years.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.660
And it's just it's scary.

11:07.740 --> 11:11.580
But also before you're born, you don't remember those X amount of years either.

11:11.580 --> 11:14.140
So that gives me a little comfort.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.420
But it's definitely very scary.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.860
Something I'd rather not think about until I'm like 80, I'll deal with that problem

11:19.860 --> 11:24.140
then. I don't know if I told you this, but I'm kind of hopeful that someone like

11:24.140 --> 11:27.580
Elon or one of these like freak smart people would just like, you know what?

11:27.580 --> 11:31.300
Screw it. I'm going to figure out a way where we can slow down aging, get it where

11:31.300 --> 11:34.020
you know, we can live to be two, three hundred years old and just like set their

11:34.020 --> 11:36.340
sights on that and then just kind of save us.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.420
So it'd be really nice.

11:38.420 --> 11:42.540
Like, it's almost absurd to think that in our lifetime, they won't figure out a

11:42.540 --> 11:45.700
way to just even slightly slow down aging, where we could live to be like 120 or

11:45.820 --> 11:48.740
130. And then that extra time, they won't figure out some way where we can live to

11:48.740 --> 11:54.180
be 200. Like, obviously not immortal, but I don't see how in my lifetime the

11:54.180 --> 11:56.380
life expectancy doesn't just expand.

11:56.780 --> 12:01.180
Well, it also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.340
Like it could be long, long after you're gone as a Mr.

12:04.340 --> 12:06.620
Beast run by a Chad GPT type system.

12:06.620 --> 12:09.540
Exactly. Yeah, that consumes everything I ever said, everything I ever wrote.

12:09.540 --> 12:11.260
And I don't want that. I want to live.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.140
What are you smart people out there?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.140
Figure it out. I'll keep you entertained.

12:15.140 --> 12:16.700
But I need you to figure out how to keep me alive.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.740
Give me till 200. That will make me happy.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.460
Well, that's funny. Who owns the identity of Mr.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.940
Beast once the physical body is gone?

12:25.660 --> 12:27.940
Like, is it illegal to create another Mr.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.700
Beast that's Chad GPT based?

12:29.700 --> 12:31.220
I don't know what the laws are on that.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.420
Yeah. I mean, once I'm dead, I don't care.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.900
Well, you just said you did care.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.300
I mean, there could be like many Mr.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.620
Beasts that are created after you're gone.

12:41.820 --> 12:45.020
Yeah. I mean, that'd be cool to be able to like train up a model and

12:45.140 --> 12:47.500
and let them loose. So my content lives on, I guess.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.300
Yeah. Yeah.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.300
But it somehow feels like it diminishes the value you contribute.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.340
Yeah. Yeah. It's inauthentic, but it's also

12:56.220 --> 12:59.460
there's there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art

13:00.220 --> 13:02.180
being necessary for its greatness.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.580
Yeah. The second that thing starts spamming out videos,

13:04.820 --> 13:07.380
the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless and it's a money grab.

13:09.060 --> 13:12.820
If you were on YouTube for how long did you run it for a year?

13:13.380 --> 13:15.020
How would you change it? How would you improve it?

13:15.060 --> 13:18.980
It's hard because, you know, obviously, I'm biased because we're doing really well.

13:18.980 --> 13:22.380
But I feel like when I open up YouTube on my television,

13:22.380 --> 13:24.140
I get the videos I want to watch.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.740
I don't I don't know.

13:25.740 --> 13:29.220
I don't I don't ever open them and wonder like, what are these?

13:29.220 --> 13:31.300
What are these 10 videos on my home page?

13:31.300 --> 13:33.860
When I click on a video, my sister, I don't ever wonder what these are like.

13:33.860 --> 13:38.700
I I mean, maybe it's because I'm very adamant about like the kind of videos

13:38.700 --> 13:40.060
I watch and I try not to watch videos.

13:40.060 --> 13:42.860
I don't want to get recommended more because I just that's how I think.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.500
But I'm very happy with how it is at the moment.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.500
I think one thing, though, that I just hate with the passion

13:48.500 --> 13:51.020
is the comment section on YouTube. It's just so bad.

13:51.660 --> 13:54.780
But I know that's not something that's going to 10x the growth of the platform.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.980
But if you think about it, you go to Reddit to read comments.

13:57.980 --> 14:01.460
And somehow, like, you know, usually the top 20 posts

14:01.820 --> 14:04.900
on a popular Reddit post are not spam.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.660
You know what I mean? Like, have you ever clicked on something on the front page

14:07.660 --> 14:11.900
of Reddit and the most upvoted reply to it is like, go check out my site right here.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.140
And it's like trying to scam you out of a thousand dollars.

14:14.140 --> 14:16.500
Yeah, I can't even think of one instance I've ever had that happen.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.980
So like Reddit, it's so nice to click on post and just see what people have to say.

14:21.260 --> 14:25.060
And I almost wish like you had that same feeling when you read the comments

14:25.060 --> 14:26.060
on a YouTube video instead.

14:26.060 --> 14:29.460
It's like it's so many people just copy and pasting so many bots

14:29.460 --> 14:31.940
that just grab the top comment for your previous video and paste it over.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.900
So the top comments on every videos are the same.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.620
And the things that break through that are just scammers trying to get you

14:36.620 --> 14:40.020
to give them a thousand dollars for a free, you know, fake ad.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.980
That comment section is one of the most lively on the Internet.

14:43.380 --> 14:47.260
And so it'd be amazing if YouTube invested in creating an actual community,

14:47.260 --> 14:50.140
like where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it.

14:50.140 --> 14:51.300
Like on Reddit. Yeah.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.620
Like actually right out of long.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.540
That would make me so happy because like when I upload a video,

14:55.900 --> 14:58.580
I usually go to Twitter to see feedback.

14:58.620 --> 15:01.060
Like I read my comments and I'll flip through newest.

15:01.060 --> 15:04.700
But it's just I feel like Reddit and Twitter

15:04.700 --> 15:08.540
just give me so much better filtered feedback, especially now that with Twitter

15:08.540 --> 15:10.420
blue, because people pay eight dollars a month.

15:12.340 --> 15:15.540
I've noticed like any tweets I get from verified users now,

15:15.620 --> 15:18.300
they're usually not just garbage troll takes.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.020
Like these are people paying eight dollars a month.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.500
Like they're usually relatively sensible.

15:22.740 --> 15:24.300
And so it's been pretty nice.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.780
Like after I upload a video, I just go on the verified tab on Twitter

15:26.780 --> 15:28.260
and just see what people have to say.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.100
And anyways, I live for the day that YouTube's like that.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.380
What do you think about Twitter?

15:33.380 --> 15:35.900
What do you think about all the.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.900
Fun activity happening recently since Elon.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.340
Yeah. Bought Twitter.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.180
I think he should make me CEO like I tweeted.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.860
Well, I should say sort of we had we just like a couple of hours ago

15:50.860 --> 15:54.860
had a conversation with Elon and you guys in exchange of some excellent ideas.

15:54.860 --> 15:58.940
So yeah, I legitimately think obviously you're exceptionally busy,

15:58.940 --> 16:02.300
but I legitimately think it would be awesome if you somehow

16:02.300 --> 16:03.780
participate in the future of Twitter.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.020
Yeah, it would be fun.

16:05.060 --> 16:08.540
Because there's so much possibility of different ideas first in the sort of the

16:09.460 --> 16:13.180
the content, like dissemination, hosting and all the different recommendations

16:13.180 --> 16:15.580
like the search and discover all the things that YouTube does well.

16:16.140 --> 16:20.220
I think the most exciting thing is he's, you know, willing to move fast.

16:20.220 --> 16:23.540
And so I think there's going to be a lot of interesting things that come out of it

16:23.780 --> 16:27.220
because he's just moving quick and a lot of these more mature platforms

16:27.220 --> 16:30.380
just take years to do the simplest stuff and they're very bureaucratic.

16:30.380 --> 16:34.740
And so it's going to I mean, it'll be interesting to see which way it goes.

16:34.740 --> 16:37.180
When you just kind of take a move quick, break things,

16:37.180 --> 16:39.300
whatever type approach to social media.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.620
I'm actually pretty curious to see what features he rolls out.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.260
So what would be your first act as Twitter CEO?

16:46.980 --> 16:49.500
I can't spoil it. OK, I got to get hired.

16:51.660 --> 16:54.180
What do you think about video on the platform?

16:54.180 --> 16:57.180
Yeah, do you think that's an interesting or is it like messing with the

16:57.860 --> 16:59.700
the medium, the nature of the platform?

16:59.700 --> 17:03.580
I think Twitter will always be closer to TikTok than it is to YouTube.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.940
Like, at least in its current form, I don't I don't see

17:07.380 --> 17:10.340
20 minute, one hour long videos or whatever.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.700
You know, even 15 minute videos being watched over there.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.660
I see it more as like the short and snappy stuff closer to TikTok.

17:16.460 --> 17:20.740
But at the same time, Twitter is a really good comment section for the Internet.

17:20.820 --> 17:22.740
I mean, it's almost weird why.

17:22.740 --> 17:25.340
Like, why doesn't Twitter allow you to embed YouTube videos?

17:25.340 --> 17:27.940
Like, why? Why does that?

17:27.940 --> 17:28.980
You should just ask Elon that.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.660
Like, I don't know if that's a YouTube thing.

17:30.660 --> 17:33.700
But when a YouTuber posts a video, why do they have to link to YouTube?

17:33.700 --> 17:35.780
Why can't they just embed it on Twitter and just play it there?

17:36.260 --> 17:37.740
I mean, wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems?

17:37.740 --> 17:39.140
Yeah. But then the two companies

17:39.140 --> 17:41.100
have to agree to integrate each other's content.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.300
I don't know. But it seems like a win win.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.780
I mean, well, it's more of a win for Twitter because then people

17:45.780 --> 17:47.060
don't have to leave the platform.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.180
I mean, that would be the easiest.

17:49.180 --> 17:52.340
But who gets like when you watch the ads on a YouTube video

17:52.700 --> 17:54.900
that's embedded in Twitter, who gets the money?

17:54.940 --> 17:55.900
It would still be YouTube.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.380
But at least then right now, people just post the link

17:58.380 --> 18:00.660
and it takes you off Twitter and it just kills your session time on Twitter.

18:00.980 --> 18:01.820
That's really interesting.

18:01.820 --> 18:06.940
But yeah, because the Twitter, whatever the the dynamics of the comments,

18:06.980 --> 18:10.660
especially once the spam bots are taken care of, Twitter just works.

18:10.900 --> 18:11.500
It's really nice.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.740
So Reddit is a nice comment section for the Internet.

18:13.940 --> 18:17.100
It's like slower paced, more deliberate, like higher effort.

18:17.780 --> 18:21.820
Twitter is like this high paced, like ephemeral kind of stream.

18:21.940 --> 18:24.740
But there's the vote, the upvoting, the downvoting works much better

18:24.900 --> 18:27.260
because you can do retweeting, right?

18:27.460 --> 18:30.140
Because the social network is much stronger than it is on YouTube.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.820
Like the interconnectivity on Reddit, you're going to get

18:33.380 --> 18:35.980
the top replies are going to be the most refined ones.

18:35.980 --> 18:37.580
Whereas Twitter stuff flows to the top.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.620
That's not super refined.

18:38.620 --> 18:41.540
But like you're saying, it's more off the cuff stream of consciousness,

18:41.540 --> 18:44.220
which a lot of people prefer because a little more personal.

18:45.220 --> 18:47.260
How do you think Twitter compares to YouTube

18:47.740 --> 18:51.020
in terms of how you see its future on role in 2023?

18:51.340 --> 18:54.700
I mean, I think YouTube's going to be YouTube and not much is really going to change,

18:54.700 --> 18:58.700
but it's going to keep growing just because, you know, that's just what it does

18:58.700 --> 19:01.540
and because it's owned by Google.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.100
But Twitter, I don't know.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.460
I mean, it's one of those things like you can't predict if,

19:06.700 --> 19:09.940
you know, a year from now, an economy is going to be in a recession or booming.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.900
And I think Twitter is kind of the same thing.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.020
One thing for certain, a lot of things are going to be rolled out.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.180
But who knows, honestly.

19:16.220 --> 19:20.060
You responded to Elon saying Twitter is unlikely to be able to pay creators

19:20.060 --> 19:21.940
more money than YouTube.

19:21.940 --> 19:23.100
What do you think that is?

19:23.140 --> 19:26.460
Well, yeah, because I think the tweet I responded to is one where he was saying

19:27.700 --> 19:34.260
that users will jump over if Twitter can potentially pay more than other platforms.

19:34.580 --> 19:36.980
And I was just saying, obviously, because Google has Google AdWords

19:36.980 --> 19:38.420
and that's Google's whole thing.

19:38.420 --> 19:39.540
It's putting ads on stuff.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.820
They've been doing it better than anyone else in the world for a very long time.

19:42.180 --> 19:46.180
It's very unlikely in the next few years that Twitter is going to just magically

19:46.180 --> 19:50.940
or any platform, you know, give a creator the ability to make higher CPMs than on YouTube.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.020
It's kind of crazy.

19:53.020 --> 19:57.100
Like some creators in December, you know, Q4 because ad rates are higher

19:57.100 --> 19:58.060
because of Christmas and everything.

19:58.060 --> 20:01.100
Some creators literally make like 30, 40 dollars per thousand views.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.140
That's after YouTube's cut.

20:02.140 --> 20:05.820
Like it's almost like hard to think about, like how high the RPMs get.

20:05.820 --> 20:09.780
And even then, once you pull out of finance and cars, the high CPM niches

20:09.900 --> 20:13.140
and you move into just normal stuff, it's still just crazy.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.060
The sheer volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these

20:16.060 --> 20:19.060
multi-dollar CPMs at scale, it's pretty beautiful.

20:19.340 --> 20:22.340
So you do, I don't know what you would call them,

20:22.340 --> 20:26.340
but like integrated ads in your videos and you do, I would say masterfully.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.260
It's like part of the...

20:27.260 --> 20:28.300
Are you talking about brand deals?

20:28.300 --> 20:29.740
Brand deals, is that what you would call that?

20:29.740 --> 20:31.140
Yep. So it's a brand deal.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.740
It's part of the video.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.460
It's still really exciting to watch.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.620
And yet there's a plug for the brand.

20:36.620 --> 20:40.500
In general, just brand deals since you brought it up, integrating them well.

20:40.580 --> 20:43.220
I think that's something a lot of creators don't do.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.500
Like they'll just do a brand deal out of the blue.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.140
They'll just be filming a video and then around the three minute mark,

20:48.140 --> 20:49.940
just start talking about a random company.

20:49.940 --> 20:54.020
And I feel like if you don't want viewers to click away

20:54.020 --> 20:56.780
and you want people to not get pissed off and call you to sell out,

20:56.980 --> 20:58.940
you got to find a way to integrate into the content.

20:58.940 --> 21:01.260
And ideally, use the money in the video to make it better.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.220
Like the easiest thing you do when you do a brand deal is just tell people

21:04.380 --> 21:06.780
how you're using money from the brand deal to make your content better.

21:07.020 --> 21:08.700
And if you do that, like no one cares.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.940
Now they're supporting you for it.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.540
And you go from being a sellout to like, oh, I'm doing this

21:12.540 --> 21:14.460
to make better videos for you guys.

21:14.460 --> 21:17.300
I don't know if you can share, but with those brands,

21:17.700 --> 21:20.380
when you have discussions with them, are they strict about

21:20.380 --> 21:22.580
how long you need to be talking about it?

21:22.580 --> 21:27.380
Or is it more about they're leaving control to you about the artistic element of it?

21:27.860 --> 21:30.820
The problem is the ones who don't give us artistic element,

21:30.820 --> 21:34.060
we just don't really work with anymore because it's just, you know,

21:34.060 --> 21:37.700
we get 100 million views a video now and I can confidently say

21:37.700 --> 21:41.500
I know how to entertain them and convert them better than these random brands.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.500
So, yeah, if they don't give us that freedom, I just won't work with them.

21:45.740 --> 21:48.820
So you have that leverage, but for smaller creators, it's a lot harder.

21:48.820 --> 21:51.660
Yeah. And they're going to just say 45 seconds.

21:51.700 --> 21:53.260
Here's what you say. Take it or leave it.

21:53.260 --> 21:56.500
And it's like pretty brutal because I think just in general,

21:57.180 --> 22:00.020
if brands were more accommodating to let creators

22:00.020 --> 22:02.540
tell their story of the brand and talk about the brand

22:02.540 --> 22:06.060
in a way that felt a little more natural, I think it would be less cringe.

22:06.540 --> 22:09.220
People would be less likely to go, you know, tap, tap, tap, skip.

22:09.540 --> 22:12.620
And obviously it would convert better, but they're just so afraid.

22:12.620 --> 22:13.860
And they want this standardized thing.

22:13.860 --> 22:17.980
Say these words and 45 seconds right here at this three minute mark.

22:18.220 --> 22:21.260
Yeah, I often think about how to resist that.

22:21.620 --> 22:23.300
You just don't do them, though, right?

22:23.300 --> 22:24.460
Not on YouTube, right?

22:24.460 --> 22:27.980
On audio, I do ads in the very beginning and I say you can skip them if you want.

22:29.420 --> 22:30.940
The brand loves that.

22:30.940 --> 22:33.100
I don't like the point is they.

22:34.580 --> 22:38.060
So the funny thing about podcasts is different than YouTube videos.

22:38.420 --> 22:42.940
Podcasts, people actually do listen to ads a lot because they it's slower

22:42.940 --> 22:46.740
paced and they like the creator voice, like talking about the thing.

22:47.940 --> 22:52.140
But in general, I just don't believe you should be talking about a thing

22:52.140 --> 22:54.780
for a minute exactly, and that's going to be effective.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.060
I want to see the data for that.

22:56.060 --> 22:59.260
I think what's much more effective is the way you do ads, which is like

23:00.020 --> 23:03.380
integrated into the content, like put a lot of effort into making a part of that,

23:03.380 --> 23:04.500
like doing the brand deals.

23:04.500 --> 23:09.420
And I just it's difficult to have that conversation.

23:09.420 --> 23:12.260
It's like a very strenuous conversation

23:12.260 --> 23:16.100
you have to have with with brands, each one at a time.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.940
And I just wish there was more of a culture to say like the quality of the ad

23:19.940 --> 23:25.220
read matters a lot more than the like the silly parameters,

23:25.220 --> 23:28.580
like the timing of it, like how long it is, the placement of it,

23:28.580 --> 23:29.660
all that kind of stuff.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.780
What percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before?

23:34.300 --> 23:37.100
What percentage of the viewers on YouTube, right?

23:37.140 --> 23:38.140
Of your viewers?

23:38.140 --> 23:39.820
Of the viewers on YouTube, though.

23:40.860 --> 23:42.420
OK, sure. Or all of them.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.660
It's just interesting because you're you're speaking very specifically

23:44.660 --> 23:46.460
like about my brand deal process.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.980
And so in my head, I'm like, I wonder what percentage of these people

23:48.980 --> 23:50.700
even have any idea what he's talking about.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.020
That's interesting. I love the thinking about numbers.

23:53.020 --> 23:55.460
The whole time we're having this conversation, it's all I could think about.

23:55.820 --> 23:56.500
God damn it.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.620
He's probably like 50 percent of these people have no fucking clue

23:59.620 --> 24:00.380
what he's saying.

24:00.380 --> 24:01.940
And we're about to torture him for five minutes.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.340
Yeah, yeah, probably.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.420
But that's something I can't turn off in my brain.

24:05.420 --> 24:06.540
Less than 50 percent.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.780
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

24:07.780 --> 24:11.060
Is that exciting to you that there's like 50 percent of people

24:11.060 --> 24:13.540
don't have not watched the Mr. Beast video?

24:13.540 --> 24:14.620
Isn't that an opportunity?

24:14.620 --> 24:15.900
Yeah, I guess it's an opportunity to grow.

24:15.900 --> 24:16.340
I don't know.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.540
Honestly, I was just kind of excited to hang out with you.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.460
Yeah, yeah, me too.

24:19.460 --> 24:20.980
I mean, it was a lot of fun.

24:20.980 --> 24:22.140
Who cares that there's mics?

24:22.140 --> 24:24.700
Yeah, so it's kind of like having a buddy to go along the journey

24:24.700 --> 24:27.460
as I'm just kind of eating shit and doing my normal grind.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.420
It was like kind of fun.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.740
And also, you just say really wise stuff constantly.

24:31.540 --> 24:34.700
So honestly, I never even put any thought into like the demographics

24:34.700 --> 24:35.620
or what I could gain.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.980
It's just interesting because like my retention brain,

24:37.980 --> 24:40.580
when you talk about something, I'm instantly like, hmm,

24:41.140 --> 24:42.180
what value are they going to get?

24:42.180 --> 24:43.660
How many of them are going to be interested?

24:43.660 --> 24:45.100
What percentage of people do I think will lose?

24:45.100 --> 24:47.380
And I'm like running all those calculations in the background.

24:47.580 --> 24:49.700
And that whole conversation, like the law.

24:49.700 --> 24:50.980
It's just something I can't turn off.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.180
My like bells are like error.

24:53.180 --> 24:55.060
Error. This is bad.

24:55.060 --> 24:57.340
What are the different strategies for high retention

24:57.860 --> 24:59.380
for your videos and in general?

24:59.380 --> 25:00.940
It's like how do you cook good food?

25:00.940 --> 25:01.740
You know what I mean?

25:01.740 --> 25:03.700
That's like the same kind of question.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.300
I see. So there's so many different ways

25:05.300 --> 25:07.980
that it boils down to, I mean,

25:09.100 --> 25:13.100
do you think at the level of a story or do you think like literally

25:13.100 --> 25:16.580
watching five seconds at a time, am I going to tune out here?

25:16.580 --> 25:18.540
Am I going to tune out here? Am I going to tune out here?

25:18.540 --> 25:20.380
It's all of it. You need the overarching narrative.

25:20.380 --> 25:23.460
And then you also need the micro where every second,

25:23.460 --> 25:24.900
you know, needs to be entertaining.

25:24.900 --> 25:28.900
And basically, what's interesting is the longer people watch something,

25:28.900 --> 25:31.020
the more likely they are to keep watching.

25:31.060 --> 25:35.660
So you don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half

25:35.660 --> 25:37.140
of a video as you do in the front.

25:37.140 --> 25:40.460
Like even right now, we're so deep into this where a lot of people

25:40.460 --> 25:42.940
listening are probably just going to keep listening relatively close

25:42.940 --> 25:45.780
to the end, unless we just have a really boring part of this conversation

25:46.060 --> 25:48.260
because they're just saying it, they're immersed.

25:49.020 --> 25:52.620
And so a big like to really boil it down to a simple level,

25:52.620 --> 25:55.260
you just want to get people where they're immersed in the content

25:55.260 --> 25:57.260
and then just kind of hold them there.

25:57.260 --> 25:59.980
We had this discussion offline, and by the way, I should mention that

26:00.300 --> 26:02.460
this is like late at night.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.860
It is. What time is it? It's nine o'clock.

26:05.220 --> 26:08.420
And I I only slept one hour last night because I'm an idiot.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.940
And I flew to the wrong location.

26:10.940 --> 26:14.460
Well, here we're like, hey, let's just book you a hotel to fly.

26:14.460 --> 26:16.900
He's like, no, I got it. We're like, you sure we can just do it.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.820
We always do this. He's like, no, I got it. I got it.

26:18.820 --> 26:19.860
He's going to have to rub it in.

26:19.860 --> 26:23.860
I know. And then today come to find out he flew to the wrong airport,

26:23.860 --> 26:26.540
airport with the city with a similar name to ours.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.780
Same name. Same name in a different state.

26:29.340 --> 26:31.620
And I was like, that's why you should let us book it.

26:31.620 --> 26:35.060
And so he's on one hour's sleep and he's literally been dying all day.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.460
Before this podcast, he downed like two things to copy.

26:37.740 --> 26:39.420
We've been going all day hard.

26:39.420 --> 26:41.460
Yeah, I've been got to interact with you.

26:41.460 --> 26:44.140
I should say that this gave me an opportunity to I got a

26:45.380 --> 26:48.300
ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.740
I got to interact with him.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.740
So it's like there's so many kind people around here,

26:53.020 --> 26:55.260
just like this kind of southern energy.

26:55.660 --> 26:58.420
And then I got to go to a diner because I could, you know,

26:58.980 --> 27:02.220
there's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out.

27:02.460 --> 27:03.740
So I went to diners.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.820
There's a really kind waitress that called me honey.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.380
So that's a beautiful moment.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.700
You know, I was so confused. You tweeted about that.

27:10.860 --> 27:15.260
And like Steels, like Lex, my assistant was like, Lex isn't here yet.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.700
And I saw your tweet and I was like, he's here.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.220
It feels like, no, he's still flying.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.820
I was like, for like an hour ago, he just tweeted about a nice diner.

27:22.820 --> 27:25.300
Yeah, it was a diner.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.140
It was a diner in a different state.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.020
And then you had to fly over here.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.340
And then I called you and you didn't answer.

27:30.340 --> 27:31.780
I was like, hmm.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.980
I was like, something's not adding up.

27:33.980 --> 27:37.660
Yeah, I feel like it's such an idiot because apparently the world

27:38.980 --> 27:40.900
has cities like Springfield, right?

27:41.980 --> 27:43.900
There's like every single state has a Springfield.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.820
Oh, really? I think so.

27:45.820 --> 27:46.780
I think that's a whatever.

27:46.780 --> 27:48.220
That's like a Simpsons joke, right?

27:48.220 --> 27:52.740
That like it's the city and the Simpsons is Springfield.

27:52.740 --> 27:55.940
And I think every single state or most of them have a Springfield.

27:56.060 --> 27:58.900
And the same is true for like Georgetown.

27:58.900 --> 28:01.260
I think the most popular, I forget what the most popular one was,

28:01.540 --> 28:04.700
but there's like a list of these people get when they run out of ideas.

28:04.700 --> 28:05.700
They just keep using the same.

28:05.700 --> 28:08.020
They're your Achilles heel.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.380
Anyway, I got to I got to meet a bunch of people from from your team.

28:12.380 --> 28:14.060
It's just an incredible human being.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.820
So let me just ask on that topic, how do you hire a great team?

28:17.860 --> 28:21.860
Like, what have you learned about hiring for everything,

28:21.860 --> 28:24.420
for it, for the main channel that you do,

28:24.460 --> 28:29.100
for the React, the the gaming channel to Mr.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.820
Beesburger, to Feastables, all that.

28:32.660 --> 28:35.340
The big thing is, especially in this content creation,

28:35.340 --> 28:39.620
because it's not like anything that's done on Netflix or are different content

28:39.620 --> 28:44.140
medians, I really need people who are coachable and like really see the value

28:44.140 --> 28:48.260
in what I care about, because it's a very specific way of going about things.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.780
And it's like a thing.

28:49.780 --> 28:51.340
There's no one like plug and play.

28:51.340 --> 28:54.180
Like if Netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary,

28:54.540 --> 28:57.140
there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire

28:57.140 --> 28:58.540
that have worked on documentaries before.

28:58.540 --> 29:02.100
But if you want to hire someone to make super viral YouTube videos,

29:02.220 --> 29:05.540
you know, like we do, there's just no one you can really pull from.

29:05.540 --> 29:08.860
Like sometimes I'll hire people from game shows, right?

29:08.900 --> 29:12.340
And they have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be.

29:12.540 --> 29:13.860
And you have to spend like the first year

29:13.860 --> 29:17.340
like breaking all these habits and, you know, and they think they're better than you.

29:17.340 --> 29:19.140
Like a lot of people in traditional think they're better

29:19.140 --> 29:21.060
and they think their way is better than what we do.

29:21.100 --> 29:24.780
And so for me, it's almost easier to hire people

29:25.220 --> 29:29.500
that are just hard workers that are obsessed and really coachable

29:29.500 --> 29:32.940
and just train them how to like be good at content creation and production

29:33.180 --> 29:36.460
than to hire someone from like traditional, which is the only way to really do it,

29:36.460 --> 29:38.380
because there's not that many YouTube channels that have scaled up.

29:38.380 --> 29:41.540
So it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on YouTube channels.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.940
So it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional,

29:45.940 --> 29:49.340
because traditional people just, I don't know, they have all these opinions and things

29:49.340 --> 29:51.980
and they just think our way of going about things is dumb.

29:52.580 --> 29:56.140
Yeah, so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind,

29:56.140 --> 29:57.740
even if they have experience and see the value.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.900
Like, actually, you'll still get it.

29:59.900 --> 30:03.500
It's so crazy, especially some of my other friends that are scaling up their YouTube channels.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.460
There's people that will come on and you'll ask them, like,

30:05.460 --> 30:06.580
what do you want to be doing in five years?

30:06.580 --> 30:09.260
And instead of saying, oh, I want to be working on the channel, they'll be like,

30:09.260 --> 30:11.140
oh, I hope to be working out movies or this or that.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.820
And they see like working on a YouTube channel as a launch pad to go into traditional.

30:14.820 --> 30:17.260
And it's like, no, like, you just don't get it.

30:17.260 --> 30:19.060
This is the future. This is the end goal.

30:19.100 --> 30:21.300
This is your career.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.300
And so I'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.820
Like, I feel like people really should be coming around.

30:27.060 --> 30:30.340
Are there like recurring interview questions that you ask?

30:30.860 --> 30:32.460
Is there is there ways to get?

30:32.460 --> 30:35.340
Yeah, the biggest thing is like, what do you want to be doing in 10 years?

30:35.340 --> 30:38.620
And if their answer isn't, you know, making content on YouTube or, you know,

30:38.620 --> 30:41.940
if their answer is anything like movies or traditional stuff like that,

30:41.940 --> 30:43.260
it's like just a hell no.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.780
Like, it just won't even remotely work.

30:44.780 --> 30:47.300
So you really want people to believe in the vision of YouTube.

30:47.300 --> 30:49.700
Yeah. I mean, ideally, it's like, oh, working here.

30:49.700 --> 30:50.860
You know what I mean?

30:50.860 --> 30:53.660
So it's less about the medium and more about just being on a great team

30:53.660 --> 30:54.620
that's doing epic stuff.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.180
Yeah. Well, and yeah, the media as well, because those it's just it's hard

30:58.180 --> 31:02.620
to put into words, but there's it's just two completely different

31:02.620 --> 31:05.900
ways of going about things, you know, like our videos aren't scripted.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.260
And, you know, it's a lot more run and gun.

31:08.260 --> 31:12.900
And when we if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever,

31:12.900 --> 31:16.620
like you only have one take, you know, and it's not scripted.

31:16.620 --> 31:20.180
And so you have to overfilm, overshoot things, overcompensate

31:20.180 --> 31:21.740
for like the dumb way of going about it.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.860
And a lot of traditional people would be like, well, just plan

31:23.860 --> 31:25.220
what you're going to say and just plan the angles.

31:25.220 --> 31:26.460
You can cut the cameras in half.

31:26.460 --> 31:27.460
You can save 50 grand here.

31:27.460 --> 31:30.420
You can save, you know, seventy five thousand dollars editing this and that.

31:30.420 --> 31:32.620
And it's like, yeah, but that's not authentic.

31:32.620 --> 31:35.140
Like that's, you know, you get it.

31:35.140 --> 31:38.060
It's it's almost so obvious that it hurts to have to like

31:38.060 --> 31:39.420
constantly have these conversations.

31:39.420 --> 31:40.940
But so what we live in.

31:40.940 --> 31:43.860
But there's also detail like there's a taste like I've watched

31:43.900 --> 31:47.620
a bunch of videos with you and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good.

31:48.460 --> 31:51.660
I don't know what the right word is, style or taste to be able to know

31:51.660 --> 31:55.780
what's good and not in terms of retention, in terms of just stylistically visually.

31:55.940 --> 32:00.380
I don't have to think I can just watch a video and it just it just screams

32:00.380 --> 32:03.740
in my head like this is what this is what should change based on the,

32:04.060 --> 32:07.380
you know, million videos I've watched and all these viral videos I've consumed.

32:07.380 --> 32:08.620
Like this is blah blah blah.

32:08.620 --> 32:10.220
What's optimal and things like that.

32:10.220 --> 32:14.340
It's almost like your brain's like, you know, like a neural net.

32:14.340 --> 32:18.220
And like if you consume enough viral videos and enough good content

32:18.220 --> 32:21.220
that you just kind of start to like train your brain to like see it

32:21.220 --> 32:23.620
and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.700
And so that anytime I watch a video or a movie or anything,

32:26.700 --> 32:29.060
I just can't stop thinking about what is optimal.

32:29.060 --> 32:32.300
And so it's like it gives me a headache sometimes when I watch something too slow

32:32.300 --> 32:33.460
or I don't think it's optimal.

32:33.460 --> 32:35.420
Obviously, my taste is the end all be all.

32:36.420 --> 32:39.140
But that's something that kind of torments me, if that makes any sense.

32:39.900 --> 32:41.740
Oh, you can't enjoy a slow moving.

32:41.740 --> 32:42.660
No, I can't.

32:42.660 --> 32:45.820
And that's not to say the retention on The Godfather is horrible.

32:46.340 --> 32:48.220
No, I've tried to watch that movie like three times,

32:48.220 --> 32:50.340
but that's not to say slow movies are bad.

32:50.340 --> 32:51.500
Like there's an audience for it.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.540
It's just obviously not what I've trained my brain to like.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.660
And in social media and YouTube right now, like there's just not the meta.

32:58.660 --> 33:02.060
And in general, like you said, a neural network, you're training your brain.

33:03.060 --> 33:05.420
In part on actual data.

33:05.420 --> 33:07.060
Right. So you're actually data driven.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.700
So you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles

33:10.020 --> 33:13.020
and different aspects of the first five, ten seconds.

33:13.340 --> 33:16.380
And then throughout the video, the retention, all that, you're looking at all of that.

33:17.980 --> 33:20.700
For your own videos to understand how to do it better.

33:20.820 --> 33:22.540
So that's where the neural network is training.

33:22.540 --> 33:26.260
Yeah. Basically, there are ways you can kind of see like the most

33:26.260 --> 33:28.140
few videos on YouTube every day and stuff like that.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.140
And I just kind of consume those every single day.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.340
And I've been doing that for way too many years.

33:32.540 --> 33:36.020
And you just start to notice patterns like the thumbnails on the most

33:36.020 --> 33:39.100
few videos or videos that go super viral tend to be clear,

33:39.100 --> 33:41.420
tend to not have much clutter, tend to be pretty simple.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.180
Titles tend to be less than 50 characters.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.460
Intros tend to be this. Stories tend to be this.

33:45.660 --> 33:48.020
And you just kind of like after you see those thousands

33:48.020 --> 33:50.620
and then tens of thousands of time, it just starts to click in your head.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.900
Like, this is what it looks like, you know.

33:52.900 --> 33:57.780
So how are you able to transfer that taste that you've developed to the team?

33:58.140 --> 34:00.220
So for like, because you said like broad things,

34:00.220 --> 34:04.100
but I'm sure there's a million detail things like what zoom to use on the face

34:04.100 --> 34:05.180
to use in the thumbnail, right?

34:05.180 --> 34:08.380
Like the answer is whatever makes the best video.

34:08.540 --> 34:12.180
Because the problem is the more which I have so many friends who are like this,

34:12.180 --> 34:13.780
they'll make like checklists for their editors.

34:13.780 --> 34:16.060
They'll make, you know, this be and this be.

34:16.060 --> 34:18.180
And you need to have like a three part arc and then this.

34:18.340 --> 34:23.100
But the problem is that's how you the more constraints you put on the team,

34:23.300 --> 34:26.540
the more repetitive and less innovation you get.

34:26.540 --> 34:29.460
And the more like, you know, after 10 videos, people are going to be like,

34:29.460 --> 34:30.300
all right, I've already seen this.

34:30.300 --> 34:33.900
So to me and I'm 24 and, you know, I'm probably

34:33.900 --> 34:35.540
my mindset will change over the next 10 years.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.300
I just haven't been in this industry too long.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.300
But the only way to like really make innovative content

34:40.300 --> 34:44.260
and keep things fresh is to not put constraints on or put as little as possible.

34:44.460 --> 34:48.820
And so that's why I'm very hesitant on all that stuff, because the more I say,

34:48.820 --> 34:50.540
the more they're going to be like, oh, then that's what we do.

34:50.540 --> 34:53.740
And then, you know, I'll say one time like, oh, you know,

34:53.740 --> 34:55.180
ideally, there's a cut every three seconds.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.740
And the next thing, you know, every video, there's a cut every three seconds or whatever.

34:58.780 --> 35:04.420
So it's it's hard because I try to give as little

35:05.100 --> 35:09.820
training, not training, but as little facts or as possible and more.

35:09.820 --> 35:11.500
Just make suggestions if that makes any sense.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.580
You mean publicly or to your team? To my team. Yeah.

35:14.700 --> 35:19.220
So you talked about sort of teaching your voice or your style,

35:19.220 --> 35:21.700
whatever we want to call it to other people on the team

35:21.700 --> 35:24.620
so they can be kind of a Mr. Beast replacement.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.860
So what's the process of teaching that?

35:27.860 --> 35:29.500
So you don't want to. No, I got you.

35:29.500 --> 35:33.300
So you're more talking about like what I would call almost like cloning, right?

35:33.300 --> 35:35.100
Like like Tyler and other people like that. Yeah.

35:35.300 --> 35:39.460
So when we were hanging out today, I was showing him how we have multiple people

35:39.460 --> 35:41.900
and they come. It's it's almost like talking to the camera.

35:41.900 --> 35:44.380
It's a habit. Yeah. You turn slowly to the camera.

35:44.380 --> 35:46.300
I was like, it is a habit.

35:46.300 --> 35:49.620
Is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera this whole interview?

35:49.620 --> 35:51.740
I constantly have been turning towards the camera.

35:51.740 --> 35:54.060
I'm talking to him. It's a habit.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.460
Because my whole life, I've just been talking to a camera.

35:56.460 --> 35:58.540
Who are you thinking about when you're looking at the camera?

35:58.540 --> 36:00.020
Do you like imagine somebody?

36:00.020 --> 36:03.540
I'm fully thinking about the person just sitting, watching it.

36:03.540 --> 36:07.340
And I almost it's weird when I'm looking at the camera, I don't see a camera.

36:07.340 --> 36:11.380
I'm like in a taze, picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it.

36:11.380 --> 36:12.340
Yeah, that makes sense.

36:12.340 --> 36:15.820
And that's where I'll be saying things or doing something.

36:15.820 --> 36:18.620
And then like when I'm watching, I'm like, that's not what I want.

36:18.620 --> 36:21.060
And then I'll freeze up. It's very weird when I'm filming.

36:21.060 --> 36:24.940
And for people who haven't worked with me too much, they'll think like,

36:25.140 --> 36:28.580
it's very weird how I go about it, because I'll just be doing whatever,

36:28.580 --> 36:29.620
like lighting a firework.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.420
All right, this is a thousand dollar fire.

36:31.420 --> 36:34.700
And I'll go to light and I'll like freeze because in my head I'm like this.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.900
I don't know. I don't like how that flow or how that shot look, because it's weird.

36:37.900 --> 36:41.460
I can perfectly picture what I'm filming by just looking at the camera

36:41.460 --> 36:45.820
and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while making content.

36:45.820 --> 36:47.300
I can do it at the same time.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.140
So you're like real time editing the video.

36:50.140 --> 36:53.260
That's something that didn't at the start come natural to me.

36:53.260 --> 36:56.380
But in the last probably like five years, it's happened.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.740
And so I would say it's one of my greatest strengths, but I don't know how I developed it.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.940
But any time I'm filming anything, like it's almost like the right side of my brain.

37:03.940 --> 37:07.380
I just can just look at it and I see exactly what I'm filming and I can just picture it.

37:07.380 --> 37:11.220
Well, that's probably recording the video being the talent for the video

37:11.220 --> 37:15.660
and then watching the editing and like analyzing it carefully and do that over and over and over and over.

37:15.660 --> 37:17.060
You do that 10,000 times.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.380
You do the editing more than being in front of the camera.

37:20.420 --> 37:25.340
So like you start to see yourself from that third person perspective.

37:25.340 --> 37:25.700
Exactly.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.220
And then maybe that actually helps with the nerves of it too.

37:28.220 --> 37:32.820
Like you see it as creating a video versus performing, right?

37:32.820 --> 37:34.340
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

37:34.340 --> 37:35.460
You know, it's weird.

37:35.460 --> 37:38.260
I've never been nervous talking to a camera.

37:38.260 --> 37:41.860
It's harder for me to talk to a person than it is to talk to a camera,

37:41.860 --> 37:46.060
which I feel like a lot of people say that though, that are whatever, make content, right?

37:46.060 --> 37:46.580
Interesting.

37:46.580 --> 37:49.260
I've heard that so many times or maybe not.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.300
Maybe I'm just awkward and dumb.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.500
Maybe they're practiced.

37:51.500 --> 37:57.260
To me, both are terrifying, but being in front of the camera by yourself is so much easier.

37:57.260 --> 37:57.740
Really?

37:57.740 --> 37:58.500
Yeah, it's so much easier.

37:58.500 --> 38:03.180
I prefer it a million times over, but that's my whole life.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.980
So that's why it's interesting.

38:04.980 --> 38:07.780
Like you've spent more of your time talking to people comes natural.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.620
And I talk to a piece of plastic.

38:10.620 --> 38:12.140
Oh, I guess you're talking to a person too.

38:12.140 --> 38:13.900
There's just on the other side of the camera.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.180
Yeah, there's just a pixel on a screen.

38:16.180 --> 38:18.300
So cloning, how do you achieve that?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.060
Oh, yeah, that's right.

38:19.060 --> 38:19.820
This whole rabbit trail.

38:19.820 --> 38:23.740
So I was showing him that I have a lot of people in the company who are able to think

38:23.740 --> 38:30.540
like me and basically make decisions like I would make if I was like, if you were asked,

38:30.540 --> 38:34.380
hey, in this video, should we climb a mountain or should we dig a hole?

38:34.380 --> 38:36.500
And like, you know, they would pick the same answer.

38:36.500 --> 38:38.100
I'd pick 90 plus percent of the times.

38:38.100 --> 38:42.740
And so one example is Tyler, who I was showing you, and he was pitching some content.

38:42.740 --> 38:45.460
And you can see like this, he was on point.

38:45.500 --> 38:51.100
And basically for just four or five years, we just spent an absurd amount of time together

38:51.100 --> 38:52.580
and worked on every single video together.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.540
And we worked side by side.

38:54.540 --> 38:59.140
And same thing with my CEO, James, he literally lived with me for a couple of years.

38:59.140 --> 39:04.620
I'm a big fan of just like finding people who are super obsessed and all in and A players

39:04.620 --> 39:07.780
that, you know, they really just want to be great.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.820
And they're just dumping everything I have in them.

39:09.820 --> 39:14.060
And like you were saying, because I'd love to find that and develop that.

39:14.060 --> 39:18.500
You're saying you're basically for a long time, just said everything you were thinking to them.

39:18.500 --> 39:23.500
Exactly. Like James, the guy who's basically my right hand man right now,

39:23.500 --> 39:28.340
for two years, he lived with me and we probably talked on average of those two years, seven hours a day.

39:28.340 --> 39:31.820
I mean, anytime I had a phone call, I'd throw it on speaker and I'd let him listen.

39:31.820 --> 39:36.780
Anything I was reading, any content I was consuming, like really just training his brain to think like me.

39:36.780 --> 39:42.860
So that way he could just do things without my input, without me having to constantly watch over him or give him advice.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.660
And that's where we've gotten like.

39:44.660 --> 39:46.060
So for the first six months, he didn't do anything.

39:46.060 --> 39:50.100
He just studied me and studied everything I cared about and how I spoke and blah, blah.

39:50.100 --> 39:53.060
And then the next six months, he started taking on some responsibilities.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.100
And now he can just run the company.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.660
And, you know, I don't ever really have to check in on him.

39:57.660 --> 40:01.460
Like most of the decisions he makes are exactly what I would do.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.900
And so I call that cloning.

40:03.900 --> 40:09.420
I don't know what other people would, but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed and they just kind of really want it

40:09.460 --> 40:13.820
and just being like, giving them an avenue to like get it, if that makes any sense.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.980
Another way to see it is you're converging towards a common vision.

40:16.980 --> 40:20.700
And that makes like brainstorming much more productive.

40:20.700 --> 40:29.500
Yeah, it just makes it where I don't have to be so involved in everything because I just have these people I know will think like I will, at least relatively close to it.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.980
So I can kind of almost be in multiple places at once, per se.

40:33.020 --> 40:40.460
And so these things that, you know, I still approve every idea we film and, you know, everything before we film and all the creative, I approve it.

40:40.460 --> 40:44.940
But I don't have to like be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff.

40:44.940 --> 40:47.460
I can just let them handle it. I can just do the more macro things.

40:47.460 --> 40:53.260
I got a chance to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming session with Tyler and others.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.980
That was really cool.

40:55.020 --> 41:07.380
Can you talk about the process of that, of people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas and just going like plowing through ideas?

41:07.380 --> 41:11.460
I mean, you kind of just described exactly what we did. Yeah.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.660
I mean, but the ideas are really, really good.

41:13.660 --> 41:23.220
It's just tossing out like different categories of ideas and then also fine tuning them to see like, how do I change, like thinking about the titles and the thumbnails.

41:23.220 --> 41:25.300
I work so well off of inspiration.

41:25.300 --> 41:30.140
It's like, that's something like, give me any word.

41:30.140 --> 41:32.180
I don't know. Space.

41:32.180 --> 41:37.900
Yeah, like I went to space, you know, what happens if you blow up a nuke in space or I went to the moon, I went to Mars, right?

41:37.900 --> 41:42.100
Because you said that one word, it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas.

41:42.100 --> 41:52.580
And so that's just it's for me, if the way to get 100 million views on videos, you need something original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before.

41:52.580 --> 41:53.860
All these like things.

41:53.860 --> 41:58.460
And so you need like, if you want to consistently go super viral, you need just a constant stream of ideas.

41:58.460 --> 42:06.580
And the only way I've really found that I can consistently come up with 100 million view videos is to intake inspiration and then see what my brain outputs.

42:06.580 --> 42:09.660
And so that's kind of at its core foundation.

42:09.660 --> 42:16.020
What I'm doing there is just like in taking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind so I can output it.

42:16.020 --> 42:23.140
But the neural network of your brain is generating the video, the title, the thumbnail, all like jointly.

42:23.140 --> 42:28.260
Exactly. And that only comes because I spent 10 years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff.

42:28.260 --> 42:36.340
Because you, I mean, it seems like you would literally potentially shut down a video just because you can't come up with a good title or a good thumbnail.

42:36.340 --> 42:39.220
Yeah, I mean, that's what happened to 70% of those in that pitch session.

42:39.220 --> 42:42.900
I was just like, oh, what was one of them? Genius versus 100 people or?

42:42.900 --> 42:45.940
Yeah, like maybe average intelligence versus genius or something like that.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.900
Yeah, I was like, what the heck is the thumbnail, even if the title was good?

42:48.900 --> 42:53.700
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so many, but yeah, people don't click, they don't watch.

42:53.700 --> 42:58.020
That's so interesting. But you developed over time the ability to kind of give it what?

42:58.020 --> 43:00.220
What makes for a good title? Short?

43:00.220 --> 43:07.940
Not just short. It's also, I mean, if someone reads it, are they like, do they have to watch it?

43:07.940 --> 43:12.620
Is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just going to fuck with them if they don't click on it?

43:12.620 --> 43:13.460
You know what I mean?

43:13.460 --> 43:21.420
So it doesn't have to be short, but it has to be like, you almost want to have a retention to word by word reading.

43:21.420 --> 43:26.820
Ideally, it's a title also that, you know, because the titles don't live in a vacuum, right?

43:26.820 --> 43:28.540
So it has to lead into the content.

43:28.540 --> 43:32.740
So ideally, the title represents content that you would want to watch for 20 minutes.

43:32.740 --> 43:38.220
So if it's a 20 minute video and the title is I stepped on a bug, it's not going to because it's all of it combined.

43:38.220 --> 43:43.020
The click through rate is going to be much lower than if it was like a five second video, people might click it.

43:43.020 --> 43:50.060
So you got to like even nuances of the length of the video based against the title will affect whether people want to click it, because sometimes they just all add up.

43:50.060 --> 43:57.060
I mean, it's that. Yes. Ideally, you want to blow 50 characters because above 50 characters on certain devices, you run the chance of it going dot dot dot.

43:57.060 --> 44:05.380
So like I took a light pole and I saw how many dollar bills I could stack on top and they would just go dot dot dot because it's too long and it can't finish it.

44:05.380 --> 44:08.020
And that's the worst thing, because then people don't even know what they're clicking on.

44:08.020 --> 44:10.260
And so it's going to do even worse.

44:10.260 --> 44:13.460
Short, simple, ideally, and just so freaking interesting.

44:13.460 --> 44:18.220
They have to click and it is a good segue into the content and it represents the length of the content.

44:18.220 --> 44:26.020
And there's probably stuff it's hard to convert into words for you, like I stepped on a bug versus stepping on a bug versus Mr.

44:26.020 --> 44:29.860
Beast stepped on a bug versus that bug stepping video.

44:29.860 --> 44:33.860
So it's like, yes, the more extreme the opinion, typically the higher the click through rate.

44:33.860 --> 44:39.300
If you can, like, pay it off in the content, then it just supercharges it.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.420
So you have a kind of estimate of the extreme.

44:42.420 --> 44:46.580
This water, right? You're like, Fiji water sucks.

44:46.580 --> 44:52.820
Yeah, that'd do fine. But if you said Fiji water is the worst water bottle or the worst water I've ever drank in my life.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.140
Yeah. Way more extreme opinion would do way better.

44:55.140 --> 44:56.260
But you have to deliver.

44:56.260 --> 45:00.100
Yeah. But then you have to deliver because the more extreme you are, the more extreme you have to be in the video.

45:00.100 --> 45:03.540
Yeah. That's almost inspiration for you to step up.

45:03.540 --> 45:06.500
Yeah. But you can be more extreme in a positive way.

45:06.500 --> 45:13.540
A lot of people, it's easier, though. Positive clickbait is much easier than positive clickbait.

45:13.540 --> 45:16.540
It just is. It's so much easier to get negative clicks.

45:16.540 --> 45:23.860
And so a lot of people are just, in my opinion, you know, a little bit lazier and they just take the route like, oh, well, this one gets the same amount of clicks.

45:23.860 --> 45:25.500
And it's easier, less effort.

45:25.500 --> 45:32.540
The positive one is doing a large number of numbers of something like I spent this number of hours doing this or whatever.

45:32.540 --> 45:40.420
If you just wanted to help people or it's just harder to get 10 million views on a video helping people than it is to get 10 million views on a video tearing down a celebrity.

45:40.420 --> 45:43.540
You know what I mean? Or whatever negative video you want to insert there.

45:43.540 --> 45:47.060
Well, that said, most of your videos are pretty positive.

45:47.060 --> 45:49.580
But not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard.

45:49.580 --> 45:52.700
Yeah, they're hard. Some of that is giving away money.

45:52.700 --> 45:55.900
Right. Yeah. What's the secret to that?

45:55.900 --> 45:58.620
What's how do you do do that? Right. Yeah.

45:58.620 --> 46:03.780
Like give give away money or in a video to make it compelling.

46:03.780 --> 46:07.060
Is it so there's a number that is better than another number.

46:07.060 --> 46:09.540
Right. The higher number is always better than the lower number.

46:09.540 --> 46:11.820
Yeah. For the most part. And, you know, it's interesting.

46:11.820 --> 46:14.180
Like some videos will give away a million dollars.

46:14.180 --> 46:16.820
Some videos will give away half a million. There's not really.

46:16.820 --> 46:19.540
I guess so. I'm retracting what I just said. I was more joking with that.

46:19.540 --> 46:22.460
But there's no difference whether I put five hundred K or a million.

46:22.460 --> 46:24.540
There's probably not even really a difference between a hundred K or a million.

46:24.540 --> 46:25.740
I haven't really looked into it.

46:25.740 --> 46:29.060
Like some of our mostly videos are not us giving away a million dollars.

46:29.060 --> 46:31.500
And sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other ones.

46:31.500 --> 46:37.260
So there there is a certain point where a dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human.

46:37.260 --> 46:41.380
And so I think that point is a hundred K like anything above a hundred K.

46:41.380 --> 46:43.540
The average human is just like that's a lot of money.

46:43.540 --> 46:47.540
You know, it doesn't it doesn't a hundred K and a million like doesn't really move the needle.

46:47.540 --> 46:52.420
And that makes sense, which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people.

46:52.500 --> 46:55.620
But yeah, well, no, I think it applies. It's fascinating.

46:55.620 --> 46:59.460
It's fascinating. Human, our relationship with money is fascinating.

46:59.660 --> 47:02.300
And why is it so exciting to get?

47:02.300 --> 47:08.500
I mean, I, you know, the times I found like 20 bucks in the ground are like incredible.

47:08.900 --> 47:11.700
I don't know why. Right. Why? Why are you so happy?

47:12.220 --> 47:14.460
Like, what exactly is so joyful about that?

47:14.460 --> 47:17.180
I mean, it depends where you are in life, what the situation is.

47:17.620 --> 47:20.420
Yeah, I don't know. There's also a gamified aspect to it.

47:20.540 --> 47:22.660
It's exciting. Yeah, I get it.

47:22.660 --> 47:24.620
Like why people want to see people win money.

47:24.620 --> 47:28.460
It's just interesting that past 100 grand, it's it doesn't really seem to make a difference.

47:28.460 --> 47:30.780
Like it's the same, basically.

47:30.780 --> 47:34.260
So you found that to be true with all the money you've given away that just didn't click through it.

47:34.260 --> 47:36.540
Like, obviously, in terms of someone receiving it.

47:36.540 --> 47:40.380
Yeah. A million dollars changes their life drastically more like that's the difference.

47:40.380 --> 47:42.620
Like, oh, if you wanted to, you could really quit your job.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.260
I suppose 100 K is like not really.

47:45.260 --> 47:48.660
You probably do like a scientific study, like a formula

47:49.300 --> 47:51.500
giving away money to click through rate.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.660
Yeah. There could be some kind of.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.420
I got it. Definitely.

47:54.420 --> 47:57.060
The returns level off dramatically after 100 K.

47:57.060 --> 47:59.980
That's basically the premise. What about 10,000?

47:59.980 --> 48:02.500
No, there's 10, 100,000.

48:02.500 --> 48:05.780
It's funny because this is such a small niche thing.

48:05.780 --> 48:10.700
But yeah, 100,000 does it from what I see in our videos, get more clicks than 10,000.

48:10.980 --> 48:13.460
But the difference between 100,000 a million is just so little.

48:13.460 --> 48:17.020
I just I think big number, big number to a lot of people past that point.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.980
Yeah. So for 100,000, you can make a given average salary.

48:20.980 --> 48:24.820
You can probably live for a year given given the average salaries in America.

48:24.820 --> 48:26.540
So that's like a big that feels.

48:26.540 --> 48:28.500
Yeah, I think it's also just more when they read the title.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.580
It's just like it's a lot of zeros.

48:30.580 --> 48:33.020
Fuck loads of zeros. OK, click. Yeah.

48:34.740 --> 48:35.620
Oh, man, that's fascinating.

48:35.620 --> 48:39.780
So on the thumbnail side, again, that's going to be much harder to say, probably.

48:40.980 --> 48:44.820
But offline, you know, I got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.380
And it's fascinating which ones do well and which ones don't.

48:48.020 --> 48:52.020
Is there something you could say about what are the elements of a thumbnail that work well?

48:52.020 --> 48:53.500
Or is this also deeply.

48:53.500 --> 48:56.500
Well, that's where yeah, it's the same thing like how do you cook good food?

48:56.500 --> 49:00.580
But it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail and I could be like, that's why that's good.

49:00.580 --> 49:01.460
That's why that's bad.

49:01.460 --> 49:04.060
That's like an example would be like one of my friends.

49:04.660 --> 49:07.020
He just uploaded a video recently and I called him.

49:07.020 --> 49:08.100
I was like, what is this?

49:08.100 --> 49:09.820
Because he's a very, very smart guy.

49:09.820 --> 49:12.780
And in the thumbnail, he's he's getting chased by cops.

49:12.780 --> 49:16.140
But the cops are wearing yellow vests, so they don't look at cops.

49:16.140 --> 49:19.740
I was like, oh, why are the cops in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests?

49:19.740 --> 49:21.980
It's like that makes it so much more boring.

49:22.220 --> 49:24.380
And he was like carrying a flag.

49:24.380 --> 49:26.500
But the pole and the color of the flag were the same color.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.660
So I was like, it's a lot harder to see the flag.

49:28.660 --> 49:31.300
I was like, also, you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors.

49:31.500 --> 49:36.140
So it's like it's hard to tell what even what your outline is.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.700
And then in the background, there are cars.

49:37.700 --> 49:41.060
And I was like, well, if you have cops chasing you, why not make the cars cop cars?

49:41.420 --> 49:44.220
And, you know, and it's like because in my head, I'm like, dang,

49:44.220 --> 49:46.580
if you just did those, like four or five things, the video

49:46.820 --> 49:49.180
probably got like seven extra views.

49:49.180 --> 49:50.620
How much iteration?

49:50.620 --> 49:53.340
Because I also got a chance to see the number of iterations

49:53.340 --> 49:55.460
you do on a I don't know.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.500
It's a problem now.

49:57.500 --> 49:59.020
It's an addiction. Is it?

49:59.020 --> 50:02.700
So you kind of there's a lot of the versions are really good.

50:02.940 --> 50:04.140
Yeah. How do you know what to do?

50:04.140 --> 50:07.300
I love how you when we pulled up that the burger one and we were flipping through,

50:07.300 --> 50:08.100
you know, that's really good.

50:08.100 --> 50:10.660
I was like, oh, that's version like one of like a thousand.

50:11.820 --> 50:13.620
But even the sketch, the idea was good.

50:13.620 --> 50:16.380
Like already, even the original idea is wrong.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.100
Yeah. So one of our coming up videos, we made the world's largest plant

50:19.100 --> 50:21.500
based burger and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me

50:21.500 --> 50:23.460
standing beside the bird because it's six feet tall.

50:23.460 --> 50:24.900
That's that's what he's talking about.

50:24.900 --> 50:28.780
So I just picture a giant six foot tall burger, super wide, thousands of pounds.

50:28.780 --> 50:29.860
And then I'm beside it.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.020
And then it's like eating the world's largest burger.

50:32.140 --> 50:34.220
Like you that's just something you have to click.

50:34.220 --> 50:37.460
Like so you were saying, like, how would you describe a good thumbnail like that?

50:37.500 --> 50:37.980
You know what I mean?

50:38.620 --> 50:42.700
But I think you said the one I noticed first, that was good,

50:42.700 --> 50:46.500
where you were very small in it relative to the and you didn't like that one.

50:46.580 --> 50:47.940
I needed to come forward a little bit.

50:47.940 --> 50:51.780
And also the photo we took was just my upper body.

50:51.940 --> 50:54.940
So they photo manipulating, creating my legs, Photoshop.

50:54.940 --> 50:58.340
And that's why I said I didn't like it because my right leg was a little like off.

50:58.340 --> 50:59.860
It was like bent the wrong way.

50:59.860 --> 51:02.340
Because they had to build those legs in Photoshop.

51:02.340 --> 51:05.300
Well, I mean, does the physics of the thumbnail have to even make sense?

51:05.340 --> 51:08.260
I mean, you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that kind of stuff.

51:08.260 --> 51:08.980
Yeah, 100 percent.

51:08.980 --> 51:10.660
Yeah, things don't have to be relative.

51:10.660 --> 51:13.340
You can have a car in the background and be three times the size.

51:13.860 --> 51:18.020
Because every one of my thumbnails, my face is in the left side.

51:18.020 --> 51:20.020
Very big. So brand recognition.

51:20.020 --> 51:21.300
So just people know.

51:21.300 --> 51:23.740
Oh, especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos,

51:23.740 --> 51:27.540
it's just nice to like, you know, everyone else might make thumbnails like this,

51:27.540 --> 51:28.820
but this is mine.

51:28.820 --> 51:31.780
And obviously, we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff.

51:31.940 --> 51:33.900
Would you recommend to other creators that want to

51:34.340 --> 51:36.580
want to make it big and they see Mr.

51:36.580 --> 51:41.300
Beast and they look up to you to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique?

51:41.780 --> 51:43.020
Unique, 100 percent unique.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.780
You're not the next Mr.

51:44.780 --> 51:47.620
Beast, quote unquote, it's weird saying that third person, but whatever,

51:47.780 --> 51:50.300
is not going to do what I'm doing better.

51:50.300 --> 51:51.820
They're going to just invent their own way.

51:51.820 --> 51:54.260
Like, you're just not going to do what I do better than me.

51:54.580 --> 51:56.020
You know, I have so many.

51:56.020 --> 51:57.900
I literally have the best people in the world working here.

51:57.900 --> 52:00.180
And I reinvest everything I make even to this day.

52:00.180 --> 52:01.660
You know what I mean? Like, it's absurd.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.180
The amount of money I spend on content.

52:03.180 --> 52:03.980
And I don't care.

52:03.980 --> 52:06.300
I'll just stop sleeping and I'll just film every other day.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.860
Like, you're just not going to beat me at my own game.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.140
And that's fine. You shouldn't.

52:10.140 --> 52:13.300
Like, I didn't get where I am by just beating someone else at their own game.

52:13.300 --> 52:15.420
I just found my own lane and innovated and adapted.

52:15.700 --> 52:19.500
And so, yeah, there's a lot of people that do copy me and it's fine.

52:19.540 --> 52:23.020
Whatever. Do it. But just know you're not going to get to where I am doing that.

52:23.580 --> 52:25.380
And so I'd advise you don't.

52:25.780 --> 52:30.620
You give away a lot of the secrets, basically everything about how you operate.

52:30.620 --> 52:32.580
Is there a I don't hold anything back.

52:32.580 --> 52:34.220
Go for it. You know, how do you think about that?

52:34.220 --> 52:35.700
Because that's also that's pretty rare.

52:35.700 --> 52:40.580
I think and this is definitely not most people in my stance.

52:40.580 --> 52:43.660
I don't think would take this or my position would take this stance.

52:43.660 --> 52:48.260
But I see every other YouTuber person on social media, even because we're also

52:48.260 --> 52:49.740
focused super heavily on YouTube.

52:49.740 --> 52:52.460
But last year, we were also the most followed TikTok creator in the world as well.

52:52.580 --> 52:54.260
Actually, we're most subscribed to YouTube channel in the world

52:54.260 --> 52:56.580
and the most followed TikTok account in the world.

52:56.580 --> 53:01.100
But in general, I just see everyone else as collaborators, not competitors.

53:01.100 --> 53:05.900
I I don't think giving advice and helping other creators do well in any way

53:05.900 --> 53:08.260
harms me, and I think it only brings more value to my life.

53:08.580 --> 53:13.340
How was it jumping on TikTok and trying to understand that platform from scratch?

53:13.460 --> 53:17.220
Yeah. So from being a successful YouTuber to understand a totally different algorithm,

53:17.220 --> 53:19.700
fundamentally different algorithm, it's interesting.

53:19.700 --> 53:21.460
Well, not even just the algorithm, just the content.

53:21.460 --> 53:26.860
Like I'm going from basically 15 minute short films to one sub one minute

53:26.860 --> 53:30.300
vertical content is a whole different just ballpark.

53:31.180 --> 53:35.500
And so the first little while I was doing TikTok is just kind of figuring out

53:35.500 --> 53:38.940
how what does Mr. V's look like in this short form content.

53:38.940 --> 53:41.900
But recently, we've really started to catch our stride and come up

53:41.900 --> 53:44.940
with some original concepts and figure out how to innovate over there,

53:44.940 --> 53:47.140
just like we did on YouTube, because I don't want it.

53:47.420 --> 53:50.580
I didn't want it to just be shitty YouTube videos, you know.

53:50.660 --> 53:54.300
And so like an example is we played the rock for one hundred

53:54.300 --> 53:56.020
K and rock, paper, scissors.

53:56.020 --> 53:58.060
And the loser had to donate one hundred K to charity.

53:58.300 --> 54:02.380
We did we went to random people on a campus and we offered them.

54:02.660 --> 54:06.220
So I said, I'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to Paris and give me a baguette.

54:06.220 --> 54:08.740
And then they said, no, and I was like, I'll give you three hundred dollars.

54:08.980 --> 54:10.060
You fly to Paris and give me a baguette.

54:10.060 --> 54:11.860
And I was expecting this person to say no.

54:11.860 --> 54:12.980
And it go up to like 10 grand.

54:12.980 --> 54:14.100
And he's like, yes.

54:14.100 --> 54:17.220
And so he flew to Paris, got a baguette and brought it back and gave it to me.

54:17.420 --> 54:20.460
And that across everything got like 450 million views.

54:20.740 --> 54:23.300
Because it's just really cool just to see this random guy

54:23.460 --> 54:27.300
get on a plane, spend a day in Paris, and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back.

54:27.540 --> 54:31.020
And so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there.

54:31.140 --> 54:33.540
But it seems like an epic video to make for one minute.

54:33.540 --> 54:35.340
It's like no one on short forms doing it.

54:35.340 --> 54:38.860
That's the thing. It's like it's just so funny because like TikTok's

54:38.860 --> 54:41.020
been big for a while now, years.

54:41.260 --> 54:46.220
And then, you know, as we started to really figure out things on the YouTube channel

54:46.220 --> 54:49.980
and get it cranking where I have some free time, we we set our sights on TikTok

54:49.980 --> 54:52.900
and like, OK, what are people not doing?

54:52.900 --> 54:55.580
How do we make it better, put in more effort, make it good?

54:55.780 --> 54:58.980
And we did the same thing we did at YouTube, just different over on TikTok.

54:58.980 --> 54:59.500
And it worked.

54:59.500 --> 55:03.660
And now we're the fastest growing or most followed TikTok account in 2022.

55:03.940 --> 55:06.220
And it's just funny that no one else did that.

55:06.380 --> 55:10.220
And you're not afraid to do epic stuff, which also during the brainstorming,

55:10.780 --> 55:12.980
some some of the ideas you like, that's better as a short.

55:13.620 --> 55:14.740
That's crazy.

55:14.740 --> 55:15.900
Yeah. Can you remember one?

55:15.900 --> 55:17.820
Because I remember I said that a bunch, but I can't think of one.

55:17.820 --> 55:21.820
All I remember is that they were like epic videos.

55:22.740 --> 55:26.060
Like, really, you're going to do that for a one minute video.

55:26.260 --> 55:26.940
Yeah, that's crazy.

55:26.940 --> 55:30.580
So like, are you posting similar content to a YouTube short as a TikTok?

55:30.700 --> 55:32.100
Yeah, those were just double up.

55:32.100 --> 55:33.020
It's just hard.

55:33.020 --> 55:36.260
You know, what's actually pretty fascinating and people who do social media

55:36.260 --> 55:38.060
listening to this will probably find this pretty interesting is

55:38.860 --> 55:42.260
pictured like the content creation meta three years ago versus now,

55:42.300 --> 55:46.540
where you can make some one minute vertical content and it go viral on TikTok

55:46.860 --> 55:49.580
and go viral on YouTube shorts, go viral on Instagram Reels.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.020
It goes viral on Facebook.

55:51.020 --> 55:52.220
It goes Reddit.

55:52.220 --> 55:54.900
You know, you swipe through vertical content now and Twitter

55:54.900 --> 55:56.420
when you click on a video and you flip through it.

55:56.420 --> 55:58.420
So this is actually very weird.

55:58.420 --> 56:01.580
This is the first time in the history of, I guess, Western social media

56:01.580 --> 56:05.540
that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform.

56:05.540 --> 56:07.100
It's never been like that before.

56:07.100 --> 56:08.780
So they're going viral individual.

56:08.780 --> 56:12.020
They're like, like, I can post something on TikTok.

56:12.020 --> 56:13.820
They'll get 100 million views and then post on shorts

56:13.820 --> 56:15.820
and it'll get 200 million views and then post it on Instagram

56:15.820 --> 56:17.180
and get 50 million views.

56:17.180 --> 56:19.980
And then, you know, I haven't yet, but, you know, you can then turn around

56:19.980 --> 56:21.740
and tweet it and get tens of millions of views.

56:21.740 --> 56:23.500
And you can post on Reddit and get tens of millions of views

56:23.500 --> 56:25.700
and Facebook and get tens of millions of views.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.700
And that just wasn't a thing.

56:27.700 --> 56:31.140
Three years ago, Twitter didn't have when because a lot of you

56:31.140 --> 56:31.940
probably don't even know this.

56:31.940 --> 56:34.820
But when you tap on a video now and you swipe down, it just turns into TikTok.

56:34.820 --> 56:36.860
That wasn't a thing even a year ago.

56:36.860 --> 56:38.660
Reddit, that wasn't a thing a year ago.

56:38.660 --> 56:40.940
Probably two years ago, that wasn't a thing on Instagram.

56:41.500 --> 56:44.460
Three years ago, that wasn't a thing on YouTube, right, with YouTube shorts.

56:44.660 --> 56:45.860
So this is all new.

56:45.860 --> 56:47.500
And I don't it's weird.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.580
I haven't heard a single person talk about it.

56:49.580 --> 56:52.940
But this is the first time where content can actually

56:53.580 --> 56:55.300
go viral on every single platform.

56:55.300 --> 56:58.420
And you don't have to write or film a video for Facebook,

56:58.580 --> 57:02.620
film a 12 minute video for YouTube, film a sub 60 second video for TikTok,

57:02.700 --> 57:05.140
write a tweet for Twitter and post this on Reddit.

57:05.140 --> 57:07.460
You can just do the same thing on every platform.

57:07.460 --> 57:11.140
And the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly

57:11.140 --> 57:14.860
means that virality is not accidental.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.300
Sometimes it can be, of course, but it's just it can be engineered.

57:19.460 --> 57:21.460
It's yeah, so many people say it's luck and they're like,

57:21.460 --> 57:22.900
you're just lucky or this or that.

57:22.900 --> 57:26.860
But what do we have to probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views?

57:26.860 --> 57:28.020
Like we don't ever have a dud.

57:28.020 --> 57:30.540
Like you can call it luck, but I think it can be trained.

57:30.540 --> 57:34.460
I I counsel YouTubers all the time and show them how to go from

57:34.460 --> 57:37.580
getting a couple million views a month to 10 million views a month very easily.

57:37.580 --> 57:41.380
And from even certain ones, like just one of my friends,

57:41.380 --> 57:42.420
like he was just really struggling.

57:42.420 --> 57:45.740
And so I just started showing him basically everything I know and just doing

57:45.740 --> 57:48.620
like once every week, sometimes once every two weeks calls.

57:48.940 --> 57:51.620
And he went from ten thousand dollars a month on YouTube to over four hundred

57:51.620 --> 57:53.820
thousand just doing these little counseling calls.

57:53.820 --> 57:57.820
And so, I mean, people can make excuses all they want and say it's just luck or say,

57:57.820 --> 58:02.020
you know, well, anyways, I don't even want to quote all the other stuff,

58:02.020 --> 58:05.140
but it's just it is it is a teachable skill.

58:05.140 --> 58:06.100
It's a learnable skill.

58:06.100 --> 58:10.620
You can study your way to consistently make viral videos,

58:10.620 --> 58:12.700
no matter how small your channel is, even if you have zero subscribers,

58:12.980 --> 58:15.380
you could if you actually studied hard enough.

58:15.380 --> 58:17.740
And like basically, if you knew what I knew and some of these.

58:18.300 --> 58:19.700
So I don't sound so arrogant.

58:19.700 --> 58:22.540
Also, like some of these other friends I have that I'd say are the smartest people

58:22.540 --> 58:24.380
in the world when it comes to content creation online.

58:24.380 --> 58:28.220
If you had the knowledge that was in our heads, you could do it very easily.

58:28.540 --> 58:30.820
I see people do it all the time.

58:30.820 --> 58:35.420
And what's even more interesting is I go on podcasts and I say everything I know.

58:35.420 --> 58:37.180
And these people are also very open.

58:37.180 --> 58:39.500
Some of them I know it's all out there.

58:39.500 --> 58:43.060
And a lot of people, instead of just studying that and trying to absorb

58:43.060 --> 58:44.980
and apply it in their own way, they're just like, no, it's just luck.

58:45.020 --> 58:47.820
You know, so you do lay it all out there.

58:47.820 --> 58:50.500
But I got to push back to one interesting thing.

58:50.500 --> 58:54.740
I think a crucial component of your success is the idea stage,

58:55.020 --> 58:57.500
the idea generation, the brainstorm I heard today,

58:57.500 --> 58:59.700
but getting really good at generating ideas.

59:00.020 --> 59:06.460
So it's not it's not just the selection of the thumbnail and the title,

59:06.460 --> 59:07.420
that creative process.

59:07.420 --> 59:11.940
It's also just the the the engine of generating really good ideas.

59:11.980 --> 59:13.020
Of course. And getting that.

59:13.060 --> 59:16.260
I mean, I would say that is probably the thing

59:16.260 --> 59:18.380
that needs to be trained the most for most creators, right?

59:18.380 --> 59:20.820
That they're they just don't put enough ideas on paper.

59:21.140 --> 59:26.620
Yes, but also a lot of creators also just don't, you know, which I didn't either

59:26.620 --> 59:29.380
for the longest time, just didn't don't make good enough content, you know,

59:29.380 --> 59:31.380
content that's worthy of getting 10 million views.

59:31.380 --> 59:33.260
In the idea or the execution of the idea?

59:33.260 --> 59:36.740
Both. I mean, like think about how many people just make videos,

59:36.740 --> 59:39.900
they film under 20 minutes and they don't really put any effort into it.

59:39.900 --> 59:44.780
And like, you know, it's like my first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views.

59:44.780 --> 59:46.380
Like, there's a reason they did. They're terrible.

59:46.380 --> 59:48.180
You know, but at the time I thought they did.

59:48.180 --> 59:50.780
Right. And I'm in the mindset of a lot of small YouTubers

59:50.780 --> 59:52.780
where I thought those videos deserved a million views

59:52.780 --> 59:54.020
and I thought the algorithm hated me.

59:54.020 --> 59:55.860
But I watch them back now and I can tell you exactly why.

59:55.860 --> 59:57.300
The videos are just fucking horrible.

59:57.300 --> 59:58.100
You know what I mean?

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.380
Well, so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.820
is to start having a self-awareness, you know, about these videos aren't good enough.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.580
You're probably still going through that.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.980
You're probably still growing to see.

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.300
Yeah. Every six months, you should look back and hate your videos

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.780
or at least see things you could improve and be like,

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:15.660
oh, I could have done this better, that better.

01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.820
If not, then you're not learning quick enough, in my opinion, at least.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.060
Where's the source of that learning even for you now?

01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.060
It's just look at the metrics.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.420
I just got back from a mastermind where I just got like, you know,

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.740
10 of the smartest people I knew and we just locked ourselves in a cabin

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:32.580
and taught each other stuff.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.780
Constantly every day, not every day now,

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.180
probably every other day I go on a walk and I just call random people.

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.660
I'll just say, yeah, teach me something.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:44.700
And I mean, it's just you just have to have a neverending thirst for learning.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.260
That's very imperative, especially if you want.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.060
Like if you want to get on top and then stay on top.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.940
The only way to do it is just to constantly be learning.

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:54.780
Or someone who is learning is just going to have a leg up on you in the knowledge game.

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.580
And what kind of stuff are you?

01:00:56.580 --> 01:01:00.700
Because you've talked about offline that you just love learning of all kinds.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.340
It doesn't matter.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.500
But in terms of videos, are you studying videos, are you studying?

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:05.980
Recently, not as much.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.580
I'm more because to get to the videos I want,

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.780
I have to build this business and scale up and hire.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.980
So more my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.260
and studying content creation.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:19.660
Now I'm studying how to build a content company so I can actually produce

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:22.340
the crazy ideas I want to produce, if that makes any sense.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.060
So, yeah, and that's the business side.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:26.140
We talked about hiring.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.740
Do you have trouble firing people?

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.900
No, I'm pretty sure almost every person.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.380
Yeah, actually, every person I've ever fired, we just give them severance.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:35.540
And I like to see it more as it's no ill will.

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:39.060
Like if there's like if I fired you, if there's some other job

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:41.340
you want me to help you get, I'll DM them on Twitter.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.580
Like, you know, if you want to go work for, I don't know, insert whatever MTV.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:47.820
Give me someone to DM. I'll DM them.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.780
Like, you know, I try to make it more like a transition

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.580
and do whatever we can to make it as easy as possible.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:55.380
And something was just not working for you because you want people,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.580
like you said, super passionate.

01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:58.860
Because at the end of the day, if you hold someone that you

01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.300
on to someone that you don't see being here in 10 years,

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.380
you're just doing a disservice.

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.740
You're just giving them more ingrained, more enrooted

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:06.780
and where where they are.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:10.740
And the sooner you do it and help them move on to their like new life, the better.

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.300
Given all the wisdom you have now, if you were to give advice to somebody

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.580
or if you were to start over again,

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.580
you had no money.

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:24.580
What would be the first 10 videos you tried to to make on a new channel?

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.900
I guess that's advice for a new person.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.780
And nobody knows you. Yeah, nobody knows me.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:30.300
Yeah, I kind of think they have a mask on.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:32.500
And you also, I guess, don't have the wisdom.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.340
But if I don't have what I have in my head, then

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.340
I would say just fail.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.780
Like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis and they'll just sit there

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.020
and they'll plan their first video for three months.

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:45.580
And I'm any of you listening, if you especially if you have zero

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.060
views on your channel, your first video is not going to give views.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.140
Period. It's not your first 10 are not going to give views.

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.700
I can very confidently say that.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:55.860
So stop sitting there and thinking for months and months on end

01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.860
and just get to work and start uploading.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.580
Like all you need to do this applies to people who have not uploaded videos,

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.060
but have dreams of being a YouTuber, is make 100 videos.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.100
And improve something every time. Do that.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.380
And then on your 101st video, we'll start talking.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:12.060
Like maybe you can get some views, but, you know, your first 100 are going to stop.

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:15.580
There are very freak cases like Liza Koshy or Emma Chamberlain,

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.500
who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them so as many videos.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.060
And it's just like people who are seven foot five and making the NBA.

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:25.100
Like, yes, there are freak cases you can find.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.260
But for the average person like us, you know, who don't have these

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:31.260
exceptional personalities and, you know, backgrounds and filmmaking,

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:33.820
just make 100 videos, improve something each time

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.060
and then talk to me on your 101st video.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.460
Well, the improve something is time is the tricky one.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.420
How do you improve something each time?

01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.660
The second one, just, I don't know, put more effort into the script.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.740
The third one, try to learn a new editing trick.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.940
The fourth one, try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.420
in your voice. The fifth one, try to, you know, study a new thumbnail tip

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.540
and implement it. The sixth one, try to figure out a new title.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.660
There's infinite ways. That's the beauty of content creation online.

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.300
There's literally infinite ways from the coloring to the frame rate,

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.540
to the editing, to the filming, to the production, to the jokes,

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.020
to the pacing, to every little thing can be improved.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:06.300
And they can never not be improved.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.580
There's no, there's literally no such thing as a perfect video.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:12.900
So if you knew everything, you know, now, you had no money.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.260
Step one, would I just brainstorm like, OK, I don't have money.

01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:18.260
What are some viral things like?

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.020
I mean, the first thing that comes to mind is something as simple

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.260
as when I count to 100,000, which is what I did do and I was poor.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.020
And I like that work.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.100
But like, what's something like that I could do that would be even more attention

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:32.500
you were as part of the brainstorm.

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.940
You would throw out a lot of ideas.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.380
People throw out a bunch of ideas.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.740
And one of the questions is, is this even doable?

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.980
Right. Yeah. First off, come up with ideas you think would do well.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.900
And then ask yourself later if they're doable.

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.620
Because there's there's different ways you can accomplish something.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.020
Don't be cynical about the do ability of stuff.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:53.300
Yeah, because there really are so many different ways you can accomplish a goal.

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.220
Like. When we give away an island, like we gave our 100 million

01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:00.300
subscriber an island, you know, you can't find private islands

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.180
that, you know, don't look like shit for less than 10 million dollars.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.580
So this isn't doable. Right.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.260
All right. The idea doesn't exist.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:08.100
Not doable. Exit off.

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:11.940
But then, you know, you dig into it and you, you know, find different alternatives.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:15.140
You find, OK, what if we just buy a two million dollar island that sucks

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.420
and then spend a million dollars, you know, importing some sand?

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.420
Let's build a beach. Let's import 300 trees.

01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:22.420
Let's build a little bit of canals, cut some paths.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.900
Boom. Now it's a really nice island, but it's actually affordable

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.380
because we don't have 10 million dollars to spend on a video,

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:31.780
but we can afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever a million dollars

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:35.180
on that video. So like that's an example of like, yeah, if you just went off

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:36.740
the gut test, you're like, this isn't doable.

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:38.900
You know, every island is 10 million dollars. We're screwed.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.420
Like if we go cheaper, it's just a terrible island. No.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.980
And so if you like, there are so many different ways

01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.900
you can achieve what you want.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.420
You really got to push through those, which not a lot of people do.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.300
You have to have like a more of a dominant personality and just a willingness

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.540
to when people tell you it's not possible, just actually go through

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.620
all the variables and eliminate them all yourself.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:04.460
Have a stubbornness and a resilience to failure, maybe for what we do

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:07.140
and creators online, it's very imperative that you have.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.180
That a no isn't a no to you.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:15.340
You really have to like think and just like we take a personality test

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.420
and like just having a dominant personality is a better indicator

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.500
that when someone tells you, oh, there's no way you're going to build

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.900
a brick wall for under 100 grand.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.140
You know, you'll be like, OK, and then still go check the next 10 vendors

01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.380
and, you know, figure it out.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:31.500
Yeah. What advice would you give to an already established channel,

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.980
like with one, two, three, four million subscribers?

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.460
How to like 10 exit, like increase it

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:39.620
without losing me?

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.300
Yeah, that's where it's very like channel by channel.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.580
You can't give general advice. OK. Yeah.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.860
Because if I do, millions of creators are going to see this

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.620
and then they're going to do it and I'm going to fuck them over.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.020
You know, oh, I see.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:54.060
So let's say I'd like two million subscribers on this podcast. Yeah.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:57.500
Like, how would you 10x that without sacrificing what it is?

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.620
10x your stuff doesn't matter.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.580
So you've talked about with success.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.100
Yeah, it's different for everyone.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.860
Like, is 10xing your definition of success? No.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.580
Well, then it's going to be right off the bat.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.500
It's hard because if you don't give a shit about 10xing, it's even harder.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:13.740
He does this because he likes helping people.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.700
That's one thing I've found throughout this day.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:19.140
Every time I talk data, it's so funny with him because it's like, you know,

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:21.420
you could do this to get more views and he'll just be like blank.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.380
I feel like that doesn't register anything.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:26.540
He's just like doesn't care, which is it's really I'm really nervous about that.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:30.020
I'm really nervous about the numbers affecting because it's so fun.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.540
Oh, yeah. It's so fun to focus on the numbers.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.300
And I'm really worried about that.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:37.020
But at the same time, you should be cognizant of that

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.900
because you've created not just some of the most watched videos,

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.980
but some of the most amazing videos ever.

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.780
So there's a strong correlation there.

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.940
It's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video.

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.100
It's actually if you look at the metrics,

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.260
it helps you understand what is compelling and not.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.740
And so I feel like I am.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:02.660
I feel like there's some value to investigate

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:08.180
what work when people tune out and when not to be more data driven, even on podcasts.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.940
But I'm really afraid on the flip side, I think part of the appeal

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.140
is that you don't care about that kind of stuff.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:16.140
But there could be stuff that doesn't have to do anything with that.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.260
And it has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras,

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:24.980
or maybe with, for example, topics.

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.900
Yeah. You know, like even what you've asked me here is like different

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.140
than what most people ask me. Yeah.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.580
So it could be. I mean, and it'd be nice to understand that.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:35.420
But again, I'm worried about polluting the day.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:38.260
This is a true case of it's your own intuition.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.220
Like, you know, your viewers better than anyone else.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:44.140
It's whatever. See, I'd like to push back on that. I really don't. You do.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.500
Well, name one person who knows your viewers better than you.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:50.220
Somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.100
No, you know, your viewers, you know, you're the only.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.460
How many episodes have you done?

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.620
350. Exactly. But I'm not paying.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:59.500
You're the only one who's watched every second of all 350 of them.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:01.140
Probably. That's just that's just not.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.340
No, I haven't. But the.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:04.380
Well, because you did it.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.380
So you do know what's in all of them. Sure.

01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:07.540
Content is you.

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.020
I'm telling you, you do.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.740
And this is just one of those moments where you're an intelligent guy

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:14.260
and you just have to trust your like instincts.

01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:18.340
Like, just think what is the typical ex viewer and what do they want?

01:09:18.540 --> 01:09:20.220
I don't think like that.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.260
But that's all you would have to do.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:24.340
And whatever your gut tells you, that would be the best guess.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.820
You don't know what the typical viewer is, though.

01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:27.580
I don't. I don't.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.500
Because to investigate, that would be very, very difficult.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.060
And then you have to start looking at the numbers.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.180
You have to start to like consider demographics.

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.380
The only way I know that anybody even watches it is because I'll sometimes run

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.300
into people like when I run along the river and they be like, I love you, Lex.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.260
It's like, OK, well, that that's that's the data point.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.500
And they're like, cool people.

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.220
But, you know, I don't know that I don't have any other.

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:52.460
It's difficult, man. It's difficult to know.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.660
It's difficult to know who listens to boxes, difficult.

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.900
Do you have a sense of who's I mean, like you're so huge that everybody watches?

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.740
Yeah, but no, I still do.

01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:05.340
I'd say if you were to just put a gun to my head and you're you're like,

01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:07.860
all right, we're going to pick a random person that watched your last video.

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:09.900
And you have to like roughly guess what they are.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.580
And if you're not close, we'll kill you.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.780
I would say probably like a teenager that plays video games like some

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.900
something like that would be probably the typical one.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.220
And then there are people that are maybe a little bit younger.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.140
A lot of people are older as well.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.900
But in a random sample size, yeah, it's probably like

01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:29.220
a male boy that plays video games like that's the best way I would describe it.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.700
But I don't try to pertain to them.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.260
I just make whatever I think is interesting and good content.

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:37.060
And this is what we were talking about before, even though hypothetically,

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:41.300
35 to 40 percent of my audience is women, which is, you know, less than a majority.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.860
If we get 100 million views a video, that's still 30 to 40 million females

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:47.300
that watch every video, which is probably the largest,

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.940
you know, views per video for women on the whole platform,

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.940
which you wouldn't think that, you know, like I can't think of a single

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.980
other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:02.860
And so it's just anything, even like people above the age of 30,

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:06.140
even if it's only like three or four percent, that's still three to four percent

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.220
of 100 million views is a lot of people that age.

01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.180
So we we hit a large group of

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.180
kind of every demographic, if that makes any sense.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:19.620
So what if we look at other maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not?

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:23.860
But if we look at educational, for example, like lectures or if we look,

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.740
yeah, educational, it can be short videos like how would you

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:33.540
text that like something on robotics and biology, on science and engineering

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.700
and all of that, that's more educational focused.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.740
We would honestly just have to pull that

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.900
because it's the same way if you went to Gordon Ramsay, you said,

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.060
how would a new cook cook better?

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.820
And, you know, it's like even then, that's not even specific.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.900
You have to go channel by channel.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.580
You really do. Or I'm giving horrible advice because if there was these

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.900
just golden rules, everyone would do it.

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:54.500
You know what I mean? Like if there's these magical little principles.

01:11:54.940 --> 01:11:58.460
How quickly when you look at a channel, can you kind of give advice?

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.740
Yeah, it's it's like surface love at the start.

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:03.700
And then the more if we watch 10 videos, I feel like I'd have a good profile.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.860
And I could tell you, in my opinion, you know,

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.940
especially once I look at the analytics and I get more ingrained and like, OK,

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.820
the typical view is this. They're from here.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:12.020
Here's how they're feeling.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.460
You know, because there are people who make videos for rednecks.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:19.860
And like the rednecks taste of content is just so much different than, obviously,

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:22.820
women watching makeup videos, which are so much different than, you know,

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.900
teenage boys watching a Minecraft video. They're just all different.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.940
So the biggest thing you have to do is put your heads, your head

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:32.140
in the headspace of the viewer and see the content how they would.

01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:34.220
Because if you just try to only give your taste,

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.780
which is what a lot of people do and things from your perspective,

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:39.900
it's very biased and it's just not going to work for everyone.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.660
And that's actually how you do more harm than good,

01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:43.340
which is something I'm very careful of.

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:45.620
Yeah. But at the same time, just generating a lot of ideas.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.420
I think the first time I've talked to you was on Clubhouse, actually.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:51.780
Yeah. I mentioned something about robots and like almost immediately

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.100
you went to generating a bunch of ideas around robots.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.900
It's just a hundred robots versus a hundred humans.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.220
Yeah. How far can a robot throw a potato?

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:02.460
I think your idea, like the first idea was because you just said so many ideas

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.340
I never even thought of.

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:08.980
But it shows the value of basically brainstorming with people

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.740
that think differently.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.940
But at the end of the day, my ideas are probably, you know, might lean

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.500
towards some people a little bit younger than your audience.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.820
Like some of the stuff. Yeah.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:17.540
There's still ideas.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.420
Like, I think the first one you said, because we're talking about a quadripet

01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:24.980
like a robot dogs, you said to replace a biological dog

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:27.620
with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:30.060
You were just quickly brainstorming different ideas of like,

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.780
this was years ago. I remember that.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.940
Yeah, it's just I mean, it's like, oh, yeah, I never really

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.420
thought about that kind of sort of it's the basic

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:40.420
the tension between what does it take for a robot

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.500
and our A.I. system to replace the biological systems that we

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:46.820
the biological creatures that we love in our lives.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.220
Yeah. And but like that was like the

01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:52.460
the pace of idea generation.

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.980
Was the thing that struck me today and in general

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.940
is like, that's how you get at good videos.

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.500
Is you keep keep things.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.820
It's much easier to make a video around a good idea, obviously, than a bad one.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.020
You just send yourself up for success.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.860
OK, so that's for 10X and already popular channel.

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.300
What's the hardest number?

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.620
You said the numbers that matters click through rate, average view duration

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.820
and surveys.

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.100
What's the hardest number to optimize for?

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:23.660
Probably surveys.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.420
You know, do you have any do you have an insight into the surveys at all?

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:27.140
No, not really.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.580
But if you just click on a bunch of random videos online,

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.860
you'll eventually get a survey.

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.340
Was this video transformative, heartwarming, inspiring?

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.660
What people rate does make a difference?

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.460
And it's like you can give people a click of it.

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.460
You can get them to watch it.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.700
But you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:43.860
Like they don't lie. The surveys, you know,

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.660
you know, maybe one person here, they're my troll.

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.220
But once you aggregate enough, it's a pretty clear telltale of the video.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.380
So either you're making a great video or you're not.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:56.620
What is it? Minimizing the non.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:58.980
Regrettability.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:02.540
Yeah, I think Elon tweeted that that's what he's tried to do on Twitter.

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.260
And that's interesting.

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:04.900
That's that's basically the survey metric.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.820
How happy you are that you've been using the platform.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.300
Elon tweeted, we want to limit the amount of regrettable minutes

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.620
people spend on Twitter.

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.740
And the first thing I thought it's like that's something YouTube already has a lot.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.700
Like their whole survey system and feedback loop.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:21.820
How tough is it to take on YouTube, you think like for Twitter?

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.580
Yeah, for Twitter, for anybody else.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:27.340
I mean, it's going to be basically impossible.

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:28.940
I mean, YouTube's not going anywhere.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:31.060
And I mean, I don't know.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.980
I don't I don't think anyone's going to do what YouTube does better than them,

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:37.380
at least not in the next 10 years.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.220
You asked on Twitter, would you rather have

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:43.780
10 million dollars or 10 million subscribers on YouTube?

01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:48.260
What would your own answer be at various stages in your career?

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.740
If if if I had nothing, I would say 10 million dollars.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.140
So because with 10 million dollars, you can hire some people

01:15:55.140 --> 01:15:59.420
and pump out content with like a million or two, get 10 million subscribers

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:01.140
and then keep the other eight million.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:04.820
So that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel, if you.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.660
Well, if you yeah, if you don't believe in your ability to grow a channel,

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.940
then you shouldn't take the 10 million subscribers

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.740
because you're just going to kill the chance.

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.180
So the 10 million is definitely a better question.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:17.980
Would you rather have a million dollars or 10 million subscribers?

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.620
That's where it gets a little tricky, because now it's like, hmm,

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.180
you know, a million dollars life changing amount of money.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:26.180
But, you know, if you semi knew what you're doing,

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:28.660
you probably make a million dollars off a 10 million subscriber channel.

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.980
But there's a little bit of a million dollars might not be enough

01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:34.940
to to build a strong team because you don't know how to do it.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.860
So you might waste all that money or they just keep it and retire.

01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.140
Yeah. OK, that's true.

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.500
Yeah, because 10 million is just so high.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:42.060
It's like just never work again.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.180
Who cares for the average human? That's so much money.

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.740
It's interesting to me also to the value of the subscriber

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.940
versus the value of the dollar.

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:52.820
I suppose how valuable is the subscriber for?

01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.300
What percentage of the videos like how active

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.780
the subscribers in watching the video for you?

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.260
That's hard. I don't know.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.620
I was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.580
Like if someone has 10 million subscribers, have they made 10 million dollars?

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.140
I don't know. I don't know why that that kind of popped in my head.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:12.100
It's an interesting thought.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.140
Do you ever when you analyze videos, do you ever analyze videos

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:21.780
like we've talked about offline of other videos across the YouTube in general

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.820
to understand trends, to understand social behavior and all your.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.500
Not all, but a lot of the questions are analytics based.

01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.740
Yeah, it's so because I love it.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:31.780
I mean, it's just a giant social experiment, right?

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.820
Like what people like to watch, what people share.

01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.100
Yeah, it's like a fascinating.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:38.780
So like I said before, what percentage of your audience

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:42.620
do you think care about this kind of stuff like this deeply about YouTube analytics?

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.060
I think a large amount care about.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:51.060
Curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas.

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.540
So in that sense, yeah, this would this would fit it.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.020
I love it. This is funny.

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.860
This isn't me like trying to make.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:17:59.540
I love you.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:04.140
And I actually I love your Magnus one and even your Hikaru one was really good.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.020
A bunch of other ones.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:08.380
But I think we're getting to the point now where only analytics

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.860
junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk.

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.780
And the normie is probably like they've had their dose of YouTube

01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:15.900
talk for the next three years.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.180
Maybe I'm wrong. Hey, common.

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.180
If I'm wrong, I could be.

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:19.060
I don't know your audience.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.180
See, this is where you would tell me shut up.

01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.940
I know my audience, you dumbass.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:25.420
And I don't at all.

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:28.260
I actually I just follow the thread of curiosity.

01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:31.420
And I think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world.

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.980
And to me, it's like.

01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:39.700
So the question about analytics is the question of basically stepping away,

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:42.540
stepping outside of yourself and thinking,

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.340
why the hell do I like TikTok so much?

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.660
Why do I like Twitter so much?

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.540
Why do I like YouTube so much?

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.020
And getting even if you're not a creator,

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:52.820
getting an insight into that is really interesting.

01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:54.900
It's like what?

01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:57.740
Because because all these platforms are fundamentally changing

01:18:58.220 --> 01:18:59.700
the nature of content.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:00.940
People are reading books less.

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.140
They're probably going to be watching movies less and less.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:05.620
They're probably going to be watching Netflix less and less.

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:09.740
Do you ever think about the sort of the darker side of YouTube

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:13.780
and with shadow banning and censorship and all the kind of topics,

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.420
especially if you see it in other platforms like Twitter, yeah, that

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.900
Elon recently highlighted the shadow banning that was happening

01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:25.860
and in general, the censorship that was happening on those platforms.

01:19:26.100 --> 01:19:28.220
Do you think about the role

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:31.860
of centralized control of which information isn't or isn't

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.900
made available through search and discovery?

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.700
I'll be honest, I never really think about it.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.340
You just you just try to make fun videos that.

01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:43.140
Yeah, I'm more I'm kind of more in my own lane.

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.180
But it's not like that.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.580
I don't just specifically think about it.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:49.020
I just like a lot of stuff in general, like I'm just kind of in my own lane

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.100
thinking about my own stuff.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.260
But, you know, now you asked, I'm curious.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.460
What are your thoughts on on YouTube and that kind of stuff?

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.340
Well, I'm generally against centralized

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:02.420
censorship or shadow banning shadow banning is the worst one

01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:07.500
because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.420
where you're having great conversations and

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.500
videos that are not spreading misinformation.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.700
That sounds like an admirable goal,

01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:17.140
but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity.

01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:18.900
That's too big of a responsibility.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.340
There's the misinformation stuff.

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.620
And then there's also just like the videos where they do something

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:26.820
that causes what happened back the day, the where

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:30.700
apocalypse, you know, and a lot of creators revenue plummets

01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:34.500
because people are are doing videos that advertisers don't deem acceptable.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:38.140
And then now all these big advertisers are pulling and the little guys

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.500
are getting hit because ad rates drop by 30 percent.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.900
And the person who just quit his job to go full time concentration

01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:44.500
now can't sustain it.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.620
So it's also it's like a lot of different variables as well.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:49.420
That makes it so complicated.

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.460
Well, I think the big thing is transparency, especially around shadow banning for

01:20:53.100 --> 01:20:55.340
people. I agree on shadow banning.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:56.300
You should be transparent.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.700
You should let people know it.

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:01.020
You know, obviously, there has to be some type of controls.

01:21:01.020 --> 01:21:02.460
People can't just post whatever.

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.820
And so if you're pulling those levers, they should at least know.

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.260
Yes. So they know how how to improve their content.

01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:11.620
They can understand that they can exactly.

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:15.180
If it's a wrong shadow banning, like as a society,

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.100
that we should not shadow ban this kind of content.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.540
That means you should be publicly discussing it.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:23.100
And if not, and if it's not known, then it's just kind of like, well,

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.100
then who's pulling the strings and like, how do we know they're not just

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.540
manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there and silence

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:30.260
other ones?

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.940
Yeah, and there could be sort of in the background government influence,

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.220
which is where actual freedom of speech comes into play,

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:39.860
that the government should not have any control or be able to put pressure

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.220
on censorship of speech.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:45.940
And it gets weird if none of that is being there's no transparency around it.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:50.420
But to be fair, that's a huge responsibility.

01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:54.460
The amount of content that YouTube is upload on YouTube

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.980
that is shared by YouTube, viewed by you.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.620
But even more of a reason why it would probably make sense to be transparent.

01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:02.940
Yeah. Because then people can help fact check it.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.980
That's right. But that requires building a platform that makes that easy.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:13.500
Right. Like to to make fact checking easy, to make the like Twitter

01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.180
now has like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff,

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:19.580
that crowdsource it, crowdsource the way Wikipedia crowdsource it.

01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:22.220
I mean, there's it's right.

01:22:22.220 --> 01:22:25.540
And then you open a random Wikipedia article.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.700
But like, you know, people criticize Wikipedia because there is

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.100
a political lean to the editors of Wikipedia and then they get

01:22:33.300 --> 01:22:35.700
there's some articles that definitely have a bias to them

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:37.860
and all that kind of stuff. It's a difficult problem.

01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.700
It's a difficult problem to solve that ultimately, as much as possible,

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.780
it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.380
the entity that's hosting it.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:51.420
So for the viewer to hear that stuff, I'm just going to make cool videos.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.380
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.540
You know, let's go to Antarctica again.

01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.820
How was that? How was going to you just came back from Antarctica.

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.820
That was I watched the video.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.620
That was that was fun. That was a really fun video.

01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.740
I mean, there's a lot of things I can comment about that.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:08.060
But what was that? What was the hardest part of making that video?

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:11.620
The hardest part was just getting out there.

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.500
It's just so remote.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:18.740
And, you know, you land the plane on just this ice runway and it's so sketchy.

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.620
And then once the plane takes off, you're just there.

01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:24.180
You're the most remote place on the planet.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:27.740
And it's it's just very breathtaking.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:31.780
I don't if you have the chance to ever go to Antarctica, I would recommend it.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:34.780
It was probably like the in the video, we climbed a mountain

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:37.020
that wasn't named so we can name it.

01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:40.580
And like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing how like nothing.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.460
Because once you get outside the outskirts and you get deep in Antarctica,

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:46.460
there's no penguins and nothing lives there at all.

01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.340
And so there's just nothing in every direction.

01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.060
It's just snow and these crazy, beautiful mountains.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:54.020
And some of them stick into the clouds.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:57.900
And if you go during summertime, the sun never goes down.

01:23:58.140 --> 01:23:59.340
The sun's up 24 seven.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:02.500
And it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever.

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.100
It looks like the top.

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.900
Yeah, you guys commented several times how beautiful.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.980
Yeah. And so it's just yeah, it's just very beautiful.

01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:11.540
What about shooting itself, like the technical aspects of shooting it?

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.740
Oh, I mean, well, so somehow we lucked out.

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:17.900
One of the days was like the warmest day in like forever.

01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:18.980
That's been in Antarctica.

01:24:18.980 --> 01:24:21.220
It's like is positive degrees.

01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.820
But at certain parts, it's also like negative 20, negative 30.

01:24:24.020 --> 01:24:26.820
And that's where the cameras you constantly have to be switching out

01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:30.500
the batteries and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.380
So they'll just get way too cold.

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:37.060
And we were prepared for much worse, but it ended up being much better than we thought.

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:39.940
So for that video, but in general, maybe some other challenging videos.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:44.100
How does how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video?

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:48.140
Can you take me through like a full process of like we're talking about

01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:49.860
some crazy, wild ideas today.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:52.860
How do you go from that to a final video where you click publish?

01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:56.260
Well, I mean, obviously, first things first, you have to figure out the idea.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.780
And then it just depends.

01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.700
I mean, pick any video you can think of on my channel.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.380
I can take you through it.

01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:06.060
Well, what about the in a circle?

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.060
You have to stay in a circle for 100 days.

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:12.380
Yeah. So for that one step one, one of the most popular.

01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.860
Yeah, that video did really well.

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.700
So we promise we have to.

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.940
This is where you get really into the nuances of the company,

01:25:20.940 --> 01:25:22.900
because we have a lot of videos going out.

01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:26.020
You can't just in a vacuum be like, all right, we're not doing anything for 100 days.

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.020
We're only filming this.

01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:29.260
So step one is we had to build an independent crew

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:31.100
that could actually do that for 100 days.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.060
That way, everyone else could keep working on the normal videos

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.300
and not just screw everything up.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.460
So step one, you build that team.

01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:38.700
OK, we got the team.

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.660
Now what do we need?

01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:43.300
Well, to do this, we need probably like 10 cameras,

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.660
at least rolling at all times.

01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:47.100
So we're probably going to need to get a trailer

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.500
and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff to just carry out

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:52.260
the sheer volume of footage we're going to have.

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:56.460
And so get a trailer, set up the cameras, go out in the field, paint a circle.

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.340
Now we need a house, go buy a house, bring it out there.

01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:01.740
And then it's like, oh, wait, I think it'd be funny

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.780
if I brought the house in on the intro.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.700
You know, find a crane that can lift up a house

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:07.620
so I can drive it in and drop it in the intro.

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.580
And that's like an iterative process where you're like, OK, this will be funnier.

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.780
So this is not all up front.

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:13.860
Yeah, I feel it would be.

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:17.380
But as you kind of see things, you get inspired and then you think of more and more.

01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.620
And this would be better with a crane.

01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:22.140
Yeah, it'd be better if I dropped out of the house.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:24.820
Yeah, that was crazy that you decided to do that.

01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:28.180
So fearless in the kind of crazy stuff you're willing to do.

01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.460
Exactly what?

01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:31.820
I'm a broken record, but whatever makes the best video possible.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:33.940
Yeah, that's that's all you focus on.

01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:39.020
OK, so what about the delegation of like who gets to

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:41.820
what are the cameramen, like the people operating the cameras,

01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.220
what who's responsible for different things?

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:46.460
Is it like a distributed process?

01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.540
That's where whoever the lead can would be on that video would just decide it.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.300
That one, because we shot over 100 days.

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:55.420
We didn't a lot of it was just Sean and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging.

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.620
We just gave him a camera and he figured it out.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:01.540
And then we'd have like for him just set hours each day that a cameraman would come.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:04.180
So if he had any content, he needed extra hands instead

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.220
of just having someone on standby 24 seven.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.780
It made more sense to do set hours.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:12.180
Nice. And yes, it was hard.

01:27:12.180 --> 01:27:15.300
But, you know, explaining it in hindsight, it sounds so simple, you know.

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.020
And I guess like the more because that one is relatively simple, I guess,

01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.740
because it's a low number of people.

01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:23.740
Yeah, the hard part about that is just the time.

01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:26.180
Like, you know, I checked in on them so many different days.

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.100
And it's like an hour here, two hours there, three hours there.

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.060
Over 100 days adds up to be a ton of time.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:36.140
And and even then, like, you know, if you have a 10 person crew,

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.460
you know, paying them daily rates for 100 days, it just all that adds up.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:45.100
What about like the 100 versus 100, 100 adults versus 100 kids?

01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:48.660
What was that was bringing that to life?

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:50.380
That seems like exceptionally challenging.

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:53.820
Yeah. Basically, the thought process was we did 100 kids or 100 boys

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:55.380
or 100 girls. Yeah, people loved it.

01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.300
Honestly, I didn't think they'd like it as much as they did.

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.140
Video did really, really well.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.820
So the second I saw that video was crushing.

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:02.580
I was like, all right, we're doing it again.

01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.340
But last time we did it, we did in our studio.

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.180
So we built a giant room, put 100 girls in it.

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.020
Sounds bad when I explain it like this.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:10.580
And then a giant room, put 100 boys.

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:11.940
And we're like, after 100 hours,

01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:13.940
whichever room has the most people give them half a million dollars.

01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:16.620
So did well. So we're like, all right, we're going to do it again.

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.860
So we threw out all these different ideas.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:22.540
It was like 100 football players versus 100 cheerleaders, 100 this, 100 that

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.180
100 prisoners versus 100 cops, just craziest ideas.

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.700
And we settled on 100 kids versus 100 adults.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.900
And then the next step was like, how do we make it better?

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:36.260
The kids versus adults are the boys versus girls.

01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.940
The first one we did was inside.

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.660
The problem was every time it was night when we did these long time lapses,

01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:42.380
you couldn't see the sun go up and down.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.340
So we're like, OK, this time I want to do it outside.

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:46.180
So the cubes are outside.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.620
And instead of doing circles, we want to make them cubes.

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:51.620
And then, you know, is figuring out, do we want that?

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:55.700
Yeah, just those videos came up at least today as ones that are like

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:58.740
really complicated in terms of the audio, in terms of how to film it.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.660
Yeah, that's the problem.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:02.460
We had a lot of audio issues because in the first one,

01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:03.460
we didn't have a roof on it.

01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:05.180
The second one, there was a roof.

01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.380
So there's a lot of reverb, which then in editing made it brutal.

01:29:08.380 --> 01:29:11.660
Like half the shots weren't usable and it really screwed us over.

01:29:11.660 --> 01:29:13.780
So we had to do a lot of Frankensteining in the editing

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:16.020
to make up for basically my ignorance.

01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:19.260
So you mentioned that you were surprised how well that that that one did.

01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:23.220
A lot of creators talk about getting depressed

01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:28.100
when the videos don't do as well as they kind of expected.

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:31.180
There's a kind of feeling you can get really worn out by that.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:35.140
Do you yourself feel that?

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:38.020
And also, do you have advice for others that feel this?

01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:43.300
Yeah, it's weird because I am a numbers guy, but also it used to.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:46.900
It used to very much, especially when I was like betting

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.180
everything I had on a video when it did bad.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.780
That was devastating.

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.740
I'd cry and I'd be depressed for days.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.180
And it really would have a severe impact on my mood.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:57.260
But I don't know. Now it doesn't really matter.

01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.100
It's a video does better.

01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:01.780
I just look at it and I'm like, oh, why did this video do that?

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:04.700
Probably, oh, there's a little retention dip there.

01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:06.460
I don't think people like the thumbnail.

01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:07.500
Maybe we should switch it.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.700
I just look at it objectively, unemotional and then just move on.

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:12.780
And I feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it.

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:16.940
So if a creator is listening, like that is the ideal way to

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:19.660
respond to a video that's doing bad.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:22.620
Just remove emotion from the equation and just look at it

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:24.100
and figure out how you can do the next one.

01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:28.300
Is there tricks to being able to detach yourself from the from that?

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.660
Because like in your case, I mean, that's true for creators.

01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.260
But in your case, there's there's like a lot of money on the line.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.220
Yeah, well, there's videos cost my life and so much time.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:41.100
But now, I mean, you just I mean, I don't know.

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:43.180
The only real answer is it's just a conscious effort.

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:46.420
You just have to unemotionally look at the video, determine the problems

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.980
and then move on like there is no secret.

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:50.900
You know what I mean? It's just that's it's that.

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:53.180
And if you really can't bring yourself to do it, then you're just screwed.

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:56.580
Honestly, maybe you're not meant for this game.

01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:58.700
OK, so that's part of the development as a creator,

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:00.740
is like being able to be a longevity.

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.940
Yeah, yeah. You have to unemotionally be able to look at videos

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.740
that flop and figure it out.

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.620
Because if not, just you can't.

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.140
And not every video can be a one out of 10.

01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:13.580
And so when a video does bad, you know, that that just stress and depression,

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.700
it's just going to eventually get to you in the long run.

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:18.140
So you said you've failed in a bunch of videos,

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:21.660
sort of taking them to completion.

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.740
So what are some of the biggest fails?

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.900
Yeah, weirdly enough, as we've matured and we've done this one,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.260
we don't have that problem as much, especially now we're getting

01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:31.220
to the multimillion dollar budgets per video.

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:33.940
It's like failure is not really an option anymore.

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:36.220
So I'm a little more particular about what I do.

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:40.420
But back in the day, yeah, like we would do a video where we spent 24 hours

01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:43.700
on a deserted island and we filmed it, did it all.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.260
And I just I didn't like it after the edit.

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.140
So I just grabbed the voice and we went back to the deserted island

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:51.300
and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:55.180
Could that have been caught and prevented at the idea stage?

01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:56.860
Like where? No, it's a good idea.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860
It was just poor execution.

01:31:57.860 --> 01:31:59.460
To be honest, when we were out there, it was hot.

01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:02.700
We were just like, we all at one point just kind of wanted to die.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:03.700
It was just miserable.

01:32:03.700 --> 01:32:06.020
So how do you avoid that these days?

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:08.580
Well, I just went when it's a little cooler, to be honest.

01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:10.980
And then we had literally the amount of fun we had in the video

01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:12.420
was like 10 times higher.

01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:13.420
Oh, interesting.

01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:15.900
So you like there's some practical details that you just learned.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.940
Yeah, I know what it takes to do videos that where it's very hot

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:22.100
or it's on water because I get super seasick.

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:26.260
It was like a kind of like 10 things that if they have these variables,

01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:27.700
I'm down to do it.

01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:31.540
But my fun meter is not as high as normal.

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:35.980
Like we tried to any time we do anything on a boat,

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:38.620
like when we spent 24 hours in a beer meter triangle

01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:41.100
or when I tried to spend like, which it didn't get upload,

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:43.140
but I tried to spend like 100 hours at sea or whatever,

01:32:43.140 --> 01:32:44.140
just like on a raft.

01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.260
It's just like it makes me want to throw up and I get so seasick.

01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:50.540
But there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat.

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:54.780
So I just second up to when you spend months in creating a video.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.420
I know this is probably stressful to some creators.

01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:59.820
Like how much stress?

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:03.860
How do you feel when you have to click publish video now?

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:04.860
Not much.

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:05.860
You're able to detach yourself.

01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860
Yeah.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:12.100
Again, in old me, tons, I'd be like scratching and nervous

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.940
and like my hands would be sweating, like to the point where I'm almost

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:19.700
about to puke, I'm like, I really hope people like this.

01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.820
But, you know, I don't know.

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.100
I think that's just part of maturing it.

01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.620
There's different, as a content creator, there's different phases.

01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:30.420
And you just like, once you get over the fear that you're just going

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:33.300
to wake up one day and be irrelevant, you know, and you just, you know,

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.900
accept that, like you believe in yourself and you believe in your content

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.740
and that you can continue to be relevant, then you don't, I don't know,

01:33:39.740 --> 01:33:42.380
you kind of, it's a little bit easier to detach yourself, I guess.

01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:45.180
And that's, it's a much healthier place to be.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:48.780
You can't do this for 10 years if every little thing just causes

01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.260
these huge emotional reactions.

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:55.180
It's like, that's why a lot of creators go a little, you know, mentally insane.

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:59.340
You know, you have to get out of that game because it really messes with you.

01:33:59.340 --> 01:34:02.460
We've talked about this a little bit, but how do you define

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.220
and how do you suggest others define success on YouTube?

01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:07.220
It's so subjective.

01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:12.100
Some people, success is retiring their mom, you know, for you.

01:34:12.140 --> 01:34:15.940
Success is inspiring people and educating them and, you know, whatever,

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:20.380
the peak of their curiosity for other people is just quitting their job.

01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:23.020
So you have to self-reflect on what your definition of success is,

01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:28.420
because I think a lot of creators kind of don't really think, don't introspect.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:33.060
Like, they kind of want to keep getting more and more subscribers kind of thing.

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.700
Yeah. But subscribers is just a vanity metric, you know, it doesn't,

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:40.900
subscribers don't correlate to views.

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:42.140
Sure. Or views, what?

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:44.340
Yeah, I know. But that's more, that was a direct view.

01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:46.900
That was more directed to people listening because a lot of people

01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:49.460
do really care about subscribers or even followers like on TikTok.

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:54.660
But if you look like your view on YouTube, very, very few percent,

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:58.020
if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed, right?

01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.940
They're almost all home for your suggested.

01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:02.300
What's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video?

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.500
Oh, almost never. Yeah, maybe five years ago. It used to be a thing.

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:07.420
It's not anymore. No one does.

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.300
And it's getting harder and harder to find.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:11.140
I subscribe to way too many channels, I think.

01:35:11.140 --> 01:35:12.660
Yeah, that's what everyone does.

01:35:12.660 --> 01:35:14.580
And you subscribe to 10 channels, they're great.

01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:17.220
But two years later, your taste evolves and it's like it's a mess.

01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:20.740
And so subscribers don't really matter.

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.140
Followers on TikTok don't really matter.

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:28.540
So anyways, it really they really are the definition of a vanity metric.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.380
And but what about views?

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.980
They do, obviously, because the people are showing up time and time again.

01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.100
That's what matters.

01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:38.780
OK, so that that's a good thing to define a success.

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:43.500
I just feel like that, too, can be a problem because.

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.940
I would say, you know, if I wanted to be successful,

01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:51.620
like as a young creator, I might start copying Mr.

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.300
Beast or something like that, right?

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.700
Like there's you start trying to take shortcuts as opposed to find

01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.020
your your own unique voice, right?

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:02.860
So like chasing views is a problem, too, it feels like.

01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:06.380
Oh, no. So as long as you detach yourself from.

01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:09.820
I mean, if you're the sounds like you're lazy

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:13.500
and you just want to copy someone else and not experiment and find your own way.

01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:17.300
But I mean, you can't make that excuse for them if someone just

01:36:18.140 --> 01:36:19.980
isn't coming up with the original stuff and putting in the effort.

01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.220
You can't just say, oh, it's because they're chasing views.

01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.820
We need some different metric for them to chase.

01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:26.060
No, they just need to find their own way.

01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.460
It just feels like unique type of content will often lead to sacrifice

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:34.300
in the number of views in the short term and by the long term, you win.

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:39.860
OK, or if you do win, you win more, I guess, would be a better way of putting it.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:43.380
Do you think you will IPO Mr.

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:46.140
Beast Burger or Feastables in the next five, 10 years?

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:50.580
Beast Burger or Feastables? No, I kind of think there's something.

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:54.180
Actually, you know what? I just realized this is our first time talking about those.

01:36:54.660 --> 01:36:56.580
We're like an hour and a half. And that's so funny.

01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:00.460
We started talking about what my retention brain kicked in.

01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:03.620
I wonder if you have retention brain for like life itself.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.340
I do. Every time I'm talking to someone, I can I'm like, OK, I wonder.

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.820
What about like loved ones?

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:12.380
Like spending time with loved ones, thinking like we could be doing

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:13.780
something much better right now.

01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:17.300
Yes. No, that is a serious problem with.

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.700
Well, so we'll pause the Beast Burger question.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:24.140
Yes. But that's why my current girlfriend, which I was telling you before

01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:27.700
when we were talking about this, is she has a genuine love for learning.

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:30.420
And that's something I have, like I always feel like I need to be learning

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.620
something to justify the time I'm spending.

01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:37.780
And so that's why it's such a nice trait, because I feel like that time is being

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.020
used optimally, because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:46.020
in, you know, taking IQ tests or reading about whatever, just why modern art is

01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.460
a thing, I don't know, whatever weird thing we decide to do.

01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:49.820
I'm always learning and improving.

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.420
So it justifies the time.

01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.020
So to maximize retention in your relationship.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.060
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

01:37:56.060 --> 01:38:00.260
In your relationship, you want to spend that time learning as much as possible.

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:03.620
Yeah, which conveniently I don't have to force, right?

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.900
Yes. Or I want to be recharging.

01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.620
So when I do work, I can, you know, hit the ground harder.

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.860
And luckily, we're into a lot of the same things, which, you know,

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.220
happen to be learning and sometimes it's not learning, like maybe watching

01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:16.260
an anime or something like that.

01:38:16.260 --> 01:38:21.300
But I'm a big believer in you're either if you well, if you if your goal is to be

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.100
like a super successful entrepreneur, you need to either be working or you need

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.580
to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you so you can work again.

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:31.540
If your goal is to be like a really kickass entrepreneur.

01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:34.380
And obviously, we're boiling this down to like a very basic thing.

01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:39.100
And so the things you're doing your downtime when you're not working,

01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.700
if it doesn't recharge you, you're screwed.

01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:43.460
You're just a ticking time bomb waiting to implode.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:47.220
And so you got to like heavily recharge.

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:52.220
And like so like watching for me, anime or whatever it is, playing a board game,

01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:57.220
like that is actually kind of crucial to my success, which takes a lot of maturing

01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:01.500
to come to that conclusion because I used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:05.540
every hour of the day. And I would try to train myself to not need that stuff.

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:09.060
And, you know, and I almost resented like that.

01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:12.620
I have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal.

01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.740
And, you know, I just really want to make content and entertain people.

01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:20.380
But as someone who's gone down that road and, you know, you just work every day

01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.940
for two, three months straight and every hour of the day.

01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:26.260
And then it's just a bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind.

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:30.580
And the only real sustainable thing is to just like give yourself time

01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:32.460
to recharge in between working.

01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.860
So there's a kind of balance you have to find.

01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:38.860
You have to. Even and I hate it more than anyone else, because, you know,

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.780
you hate not working.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:43.340
Yeah, because it's just not optimal for time.

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:46.060
Like it's it's it's as a human.

01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:50.100
I do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game.

01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:54.820
And it took me a very long time to like come to peace with that and not.

01:39:55.340 --> 01:39:58.900
I would have like borderline panic attacks when I do it, because I think I just

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.140
what am I doing right now? Why am I doing this?

01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.980
I should be, you know, like, what if one day I have to lay off an employee

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:06.220
because we're not doing so well?

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:09.940
Like, how could I justify watching this the show or whatever I'm doing right now?

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.740
You know, it's like there's a lot of things like that that go on in your head,

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:16.220
but it's necessary before you return to Mr.

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:17.180
Beesberger.

01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:21.180
Well, what is like a since we're on the topic,

01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:24.620
what is a perfect day in the life, perfectly productive day in the life

01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:27.020
of Mr. Bees look like? Oh, boy.

01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.940
Well, I mean, well, like a stand.

01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:31.340
I mean, the perfectly productive day is we film a main channel video

01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:33.820
because those get 100 million to pop.

01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:35.740
I mean, it doesn't really get any better than that.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:39.300
What about like the average day when you're not on the set?

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:42.900
Yeah. And you're like like because you're running a lot of things, right?

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:45.580
Yeah. So right now we have our snack brand Feastables.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.260
We have a restaurant chain, Beesberger.

01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:51.300
And then we basically which we haven't even really launched any products yet.

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:53.820
But we have the the data company that I was showing you,

01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:55.940
where we're going to roll out some tools for creators.

01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:58.700
And then we have the Reacts channel, the gaming channel, the main channel.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.740
And then we have my charity, which also has a channel.

01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:05.740
And so kind of how I've structured my life right now

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:08.380
is whatever I have free time.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.140
We just kind of go, hey, guys, Jimmy's got an hour from two p.m.

01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.500
to three p.m.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:15.900
And everyone's just like, I need this, I need this.

01:41:15.900 --> 01:41:18.820
And this channel's like, I need this thing filmed or, you know, whatever.

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:20.980
The guy who runs my TikTok is like, I need this TikTok filmed.

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:24.060
Or, you know, Beesberger is like, I need this menu item approved.

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:25.140
We need to talk about this marketing thing.

01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:27.260
And then we kind of just look at what everyone needs.

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:29.260
And we're like, that one looks like the most important.

01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.900
We'll do that. And then so it's just kind of like, you know,

01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:36.260
if I just did that for every company in a day, then that's optimal.

01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:39.500
I just kind of like an optimal day for me would be going down to eight companies

01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:42.500
and just whatever their like two to three biggest pain points

01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:45.500
or things they need from me and just doing those based on priority

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.980
and then trying to keep it as short as possible.

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:49.820
Yeah. To just the things that you're needed on.

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:51.260
It doesn't get more optimal than that.

01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:54.500
If I clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies, then

01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:57.340
it's yes, that's a perfect day.

01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:01.020
Yeah. I mean, even just me, because you're like, you're showing me around

01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:03.380
and you're being a great and gracious host.

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:05.540
But on top of that, you're just doing all these meetings.

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:07.580
You basically I felt bad at some point.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.260
So I was like, oh, I just tricked him into going to meetings with me.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.700
He's like my little meeting buddy.

01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:13.820
Yeah. I mean, it was fun.

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820
It's fun to see it.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:18.820
It was fun to see how effectively you've delegated.

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:22.740
You basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things.

01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:25.180
And there's just a strong team that's able to

01:42:26.260 --> 01:42:29.700
carry the flag on all the different tasks from the from the brainstorming

01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.900
and the main channel to the reacts and so on.

01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:32.900
Yeah, it's really interesting.

01:42:32.900 --> 01:42:35.860
I mean, it's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that,

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:40.100
because you very quickly build a very large team that's that's able to scale.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:43.140
It's just very scary because it's my first, you know,

01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:46.900
I'm 24, you know, and I think I was telling you this earlier.

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:49.780
It's funny, because six years ago, I had to raise my hand to use the bathroom.

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.180
And now I'm in charge of hundreds of people and entertain hundreds

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:54.100
of millions of people.

01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:56.820
And so it is crazy just how quick it comes up.

01:42:56.820 --> 01:43:00.580
And I wish I was a little bit older

01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:04.460
so I could have ran a couple of companies and failed a few companies in the past

01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:07.220
and like learn from those and apply those here, because I know for a fact

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:11.540
when I'm 34, I'm 24 now, when I'm 34, I'll know so much more

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:14.660
about running a business and scaling and hiring and and how to lead people

01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:17.020
and better effectively communicate and all these different skill sets

01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:21.460
that will make me a better leader that that's the only thing that sucks is

01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:24.740
I just don't have those because I just haven't been through the lessons.

01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:28.500
And I just have such a lucrative thing on my plate right now.

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.860
And it just sucks that I have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing.

01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:31.700
You know what I mean?

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.140
Yeah, because you already have so much influence, so much impact.

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.740
But you have effectively scaled.

01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:39.620
What lessons do you draw from that?

01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:42.900
How to effectively scale as a 24 year old like you?

01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:45.700
That's something I feel like I actually could give a lot of value to,

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:49.140
to young people who are doing it, like older people who've built five companies

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.140
or whatever they do.

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.620
I probably couldn't be like, oh, this is so obvious.

01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:58.420
But for younger, first time business owners,

01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:01.740
you got to just experiment, to be honest.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:04.420
And for us, like it's just a new space.

01:44:04.420 --> 01:44:08.820
No one had really ever scaled up a hundred person team to build, make content on YouTube.

01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.860
So there wasn't no I spent all this time like I hired one person from Disney

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:16.020
to at one point to come in and help.

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:18.460
And obviously, that was a dumb idea looking back on it.

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.900
But, you know, I thought, oh, they make great stuff.

01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:23.660
People want to watch and they come over here and help me build a team.

01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:27.780
And, you know, they build it more the traditional way and not like how it should be online.

01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:32.940
And so then it's like, OK, now I'm not trying to trash people like they all tried their best.

01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:38.940
But then I hire this one person who does this different type of media and runs a hundred person team.

01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.380
And then you come in here and they try to build it that way.

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:43.940
They don't really listen to you or value or see the difference.

01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:49.060
And I tried basically for building this company with like four or five different people

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:51.780
who worked in different veins of media.

01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:55.900
And, you know, every single time, it's just like they just don't get it.

01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.780
And they don't understand my world.

01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.060
And the eventual solution was just like to roll up my sleeves and do it myself.

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:06.300
You know, with like James or a hit man and just like, no, no one's ever done this.

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:09.460
And like, no one's going to just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company.

01:45:09.460 --> 01:45:10.900
We got to figure the fuck out ourselves.

01:45:10.900 --> 01:45:12.980
And you have to kind of build up people from scratch then.

01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:17.020
Yeah, exactly. All the stuff I was talking about earlier and all the lessons I learned along the way.

01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:22.500
And so for me, that was a big part of like, stop trying to have someone

01:45:23.020 --> 01:45:26.220
build this company for me and just do it myself, because it's scary.

01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:29.460
I guess my whole life studying YouTube videos and virality, not business building.

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:32.420
But fuck it. I was like, I guess we just got to do it ourselves.

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.140
And that's where things really start to click.

01:45:35.140 --> 01:45:36.540
And we got the exponential growth.

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.540
We started getting the right people and training them the right way.

01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:41.580
And, you know, just throwing conventional stuff out the door

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:44.420
and focusing on what's actually practical for YouTube,

01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.940
which is just completely different than traditional media.

01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.580
So you train people and then those people train people and so on.

01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:56.820
Yeah, I mean, it's just even like, you know, how you do the lighting on sets or like

01:45:57.180 --> 01:46:00.980
how you do the audio or or, you know, not writing scripts.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:03.740
So, you know, we're just not as efficient with our filming.

01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:05.740
Like sometimes I have to have 30 cameras running.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:07.340
Why? Because it's not scripted.

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:10.380
I don't I don't know what Chris is going to do when we start filming.

01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:11.860
He might run over there.

01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:14.220
But guess what? We got to have a plan because there's only one shot.

01:46:14.220 --> 01:46:15.940
I can't, you know, tell him not to do that.

01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:17.140
Yeah, that's the shooting.

01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:18.540
But then there's also the editing.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.300
Yeah. And then the editing as well and not having guardrails and kind of, you know,

01:46:23.140 --> 01:46:24.660
at the end of the day, it's whatever I want.

01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:27.740
The video, their job is to make a video that they think I'll like

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:28.540
because it's my channel.

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.220
But, you know, you can achieve that kind of however.

01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.900
And so it's just everything's just different.

01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:36.980
You know, it's much more, I guess, like a startup as opposed to.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:40.340
Are you often surprised, like with the result, like

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:44.340
you think a certain like we watch the video today, those really nice,

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:47.140
those different than you would have potentially edited it.

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:50.860
Yeah. Are you sometimes surprised by like a decision that it makes?

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:53.220
It's like, OK, that's not the way I would have done it,

01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:55.060
but it's actually this is a cool idea.

01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:57.100
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:00.180
The thing, my biggest fear is I don't ever want to get trapped in like

01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:03.380
bubble of, you know, because we are getting 100 million views

01:47:03.380 --> 01:47:04.340
of video on the main channel.

01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:07.340
Like, but I don't want to get in this feedback loop of just

01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:11.980
my ideas are greater or I get that feedback loop, but stop learning and improving

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:15.860
because it is easy sometimes to be like, what we're doing is working.

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:16.980
We need to just keep doing it.

01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:19.420
I want to keep learning and trying new things.

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:22.780
And I guess one way I'd put it is like, you don't

01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:27.020
when when you're on a come up or you're growing, you don't want to

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:32.180
test new things once you start to plateau or have a downtrend,

01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:35.820
because if you're like, you know, you're skyrocketing, right?

01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:36.660
You're up, up, up.

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.060
And then you level off, you start to go down and you're like, oh,

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.940
this isn't working anymore. Let's start experimenting.

01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:43.940
Well, if you have a bad experiment, now you're in like a tailspin.

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:46.260
You're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment.

01:47:46.260 --> 01:47:48.300
You're like, screwed. Kind of oversimplified.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.140
You want to test things while you're still growing to keep the growing

01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:56.700
from happening, because once you like have, you know, again, very oversimplifying

01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:58.820
that, like, you know, kind of level off.

01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:01.780
You do a couple of tests that go wrong in my you're like screwed.

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.820
You know, you're already out the door.

01:48:02.820 --> 01:48:06.100
Now you're just confirming that you're out the door and online entertainment.

01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:08.100
So that's kind of how I see it.

01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.660
So I think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting

01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:13.700
and trying things, even if you're getting crazy, unheard of growth.

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:18.860
And so that outside of the thing that brought you to the dance,

01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:21.780
you just dived right into Mr.

01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:23.380
Beast Burger and Feastables.

01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:25.500
This is a whole nother industry.

01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.580
Like, what was that like?

01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.820
Well, so Beast Burger, we kind of

01:48:30.020 --> 01:48:32.100
it's supposed to be like just a pop up.

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.500
Like we just partnered with someone who had three hundred restaurants

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:37.100
and we're just like, you know,

01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.900
let's let's just sell these burgers for a day or two.

01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.940
Let's let's see what happens.

01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:43.580
We didn't really think it would be as big as it was.

01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:47.500
But those first like that first day, you know, we do six figures in sales

01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:50.140
and they all sell out and they're running to local Walmart's.

01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:51.620
They can't keep up with the demand.

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:55.740
And it's like, OK, well, maybe let's just leave it open a week, whatever.

01:48:56.300 --> 01:48:58.660
And we're just doing crazy revenue.

01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.900
And it's like, OK, well, let's add some more restaurants

01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:02.580
and let's just leave them open for a month.

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.340
And we're just still doing six figures a day.

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.620
And it kind of just went from this thing that was

01:49:07.420 --> 01:49:08.940
I don't know, it wasn't really

01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:12.220
I don't really plan on running a restaurant chain, but here I am.

01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:16.700
But didn't that in some sense also open your mind to something like Feastables?

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.900
Feastables is something I've always wanted to do, because I think just in general,

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.060
American snacks are just full of so much

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:27.180
horrible ingredients, to be honest, and they're not.

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:30.380
I don't know. I feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.140
in American snacks in quite a while.

01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.340
And so that's just something I've always been pretty passionate about.

01:49:35.540 --> 01:49:37.100
The thing we built that from scratch.

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.780
So we hired the CEO and built a team around them.

01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:43.660
And we spent probably over two and a half years before we even launched.

01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:45.220
It's like building the right team,

01:49:45.220 --> 01:49:48.220
figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way I wanted.

01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:51.660
Which Feastables has just been crushing.

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:54.020
It's it's very interesting.

01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.100
This is something I've never talked about publicly, but having products in retail,

01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:01.260
it's like before Feastables, everything I had done was online.

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:05.060
So if you wanted to, you know, anything from the Cocoa Peace brand,

01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:07.220
you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you.

01:50:07.220 --> 01:50:11.580
But Feastables now that, you know, because our first product, Chocolate Bars,

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:13.780
we started putting that in retail locations.

01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:17.460
So, like, for example, Walmart, it's it's crazy.

01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:19.260
Like, it's just it doesn't make sense.

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:23.740
How if you're which I guess it does for because we get 100 million views a video.

01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:24.700
So a lot of people know us.

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.900
If I go stand on Walmart, those people recognize me and ask for photos.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.460
Like if I stood there long enough, I could take 150 photos today in Walmart, 200,

01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:32.340
whatever it is.

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:33.580
So obviously, it makes sense.

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:34.860
Those people go Feastables.

01:50:34.860 --> 01:50:37.780
But then you just multiply that by every Walmart in America.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:39.580
And it just gets so crazy.

01:50:39.620 --> 01:50:42.060
And I didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are.

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.140
And we're about to launch in some other I don't know if I'm allowed to say it.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:50.140
So whatever, but other big retail locations and convenience stores.

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.420
And like by the end of next year, we could be in like 40,000, 50,000 locations.

01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:56.740
And the numbers just don't make sense.

01:50:57.420 --> 01:51:00.540
What are some interesting challenges about scaling there that surprised you?

01:51:00.860 --> 01:51:04.940
The biggest problem, which I didn't think would be was just keeping the shelves

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:06.420
and Walmart stock, to be honest.

01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:09.340
Like that supply, the supply chain is brutal.

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:13.980
Well, even then sometimes you get them the stuff and it takes them like a day or two

01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:16.020
to put it out in that specific location.

01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:22.700
And I had to stop promoting it because every time I'd mention it, like 40% of people

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:24.300
would just be like, it's not there.

01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:25.860
It's not in Walmart or I can't buy it.

01:51:26.060 --> 01:51:32.540
And so there's like a three-ish month period where I just didn't promote Feastables

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:35.700
because I was scared that someone would go buy it and it's just not there.

01:51:35.700 --> 01:51:39.140
And so like it took us a very long time to catch up to the demand.

01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:41.780
And also, you know, it's not like we have unlimited money.

01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:47.100
So, but now we're relatively caught up in keeping up, but it's going to be interesting

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:53.500
because now this year in 2023, we're going to basically, you know, 10x the amount of

01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:54.300
locations are in.

01:51:54.300 --> 01:51:56.820
So we're and we're going to try to launch new products.

01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:59.660
So we're in for an interesting ride.

01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:05.140
But yeah, I just hate, I hate when I tell people, you know, like, hey, go try this

01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:08.140
product. And then they go on their local Walmart and eventually other places and it's

01:52:08.140 --> 01:52:11.740
not there. It's just so brutal, you know, that they made that whole journey out there

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:14.180
and they can get it. And so that was really it.

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:19.140
Besides that, that's it's been doing way better than I ever thought.

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:25.460
You've talked to a couple of places about maybe doing mobile games or computer games

01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:28.060
in the future. Is that something you're still considering?

01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:33.460
Yes, because, you know, do you normally talk with people as much as we talked

01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:36.980
beforehand? No, no, that was the problem.

01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:40.180
We spent all day today talking about something.

01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:42.940
I just looked at my head. Everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about.

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:43.660
Not really.

01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.220
Well, no, no, not everything. I take it back.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:47.060
But sorry, the last two questions.

01:52:47.060 --> 01:52:49.460
Yes. And so it's just funny because.

01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.780
Yeah, what? No, I tried.

01:52:50.780 --> 01:52:55.220
It's OK. There's a different style of asking those questions because I on purpose

01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.140
didn't dig further with you.

01:52:57.340 --> 01:52:59.260
I could tell. Yeah, I could tell.

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:01.220
OK, this is by the way. OK, all right.

01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:06.140
Well, this is the first time I've ever talked to somebody

01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:10.380
as much as I did with you beforehand.

01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:13.060
Yeah. On the same day.

01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:15.380
I know. Not in the same day together.

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:17.620
We're talking only one hour. Yeah, yeah.

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.540
Literally, it's funny.

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:23.660
This is a hilarious and awesome social experiment.

01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:27.820
I picked him up from his hotel and I just like harassed him all day to hang out with me.

01:53:27.980 --> 01:53:29.900
And then here we are now. I love it.

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:33.380
I was secretly recording the whole time, just you know, I'm just kidding.

01:53:34.180 --> 01:53:36.780
Anyway, so what was the question?

01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:40.300
Yeah, so the interesting thing is with Beast Burger and Feastables

01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:46.300
that there's physical goods as opposed to like making mobile games or a PC game,

01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.460
whichever one we end up doing, which is software.

01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:51.700
And I actually have a giant international audience.

01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:55.220
Like most of my audience is obviously outside of America.

01:53:55.420 --> 01:53:58.220
And so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up

01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:02.820
the supply chain and get Feastables in Southeast Asia, get Feastables in India,

01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:05.380
get Feastables in Brazil and Mexico and all these other places

01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:07.420
where we have giant pockets of our audience.

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.900
And same thing with Beast Burger.

01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:11.140
It's just it's going to take probably years

01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.940
unless we partner with someone who already has a distribution, which we're figuring out.

01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:19.540
But the beauty of software is I can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing.

01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:25.100
And all my fans can, you know, use it tomorrow, the day I mentioned it.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.620
And so if I promote something in a video to 100 million people

01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:31.940
and it's like, you know, basically like a game, they can all download it.

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:37.420
So, you know, but if I promote a Feastables bar right now, it's only in America

01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.580
because we're struggling just to keep up with the American demand.

01:54:39.580 --> 01:54:41.420
We haven't even gotten the chance to go outside of America.

01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:44.660
So I alienate a majority of my audience.

01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:49.020
And it feels so shitty to just, you know, mention something that most of them can't buy.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:53.020
But on the flip side, you can't just spawn this crazy infrastructure

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:57.060
and just have tens of millions of bars and all your products

01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:58.860
in every single store across the world before you promote it.

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:00.660
So you can't put the egg before the chicken.

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:04.460
And so it's like that's that's what I'm excited about.

01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.420
I want to get into less physical stuff and more stuff that everyone out

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:12.020
can actually use, especially if there's a social element to the gaming, too,

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:13.740
because it's not unlike Feastables.

01:55:13.740 --> 01:55:15.220
Like that's a product you consume.

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.940
You missed it when you're setting up for this.

01:55:16.940 --> 01:55:21.980
We were doing some basically just laying out every everything that we're planning for.

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.260
So at the phase where we're

01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.660
want to start hiring the team to build it and we're kind of just laying out the game.

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:29.420
And I was actually really curious to get your thoughts, but I can't say it

01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:32.580
because whatever I say, someone's just going to take it and run with it.

01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:35.860
But you're a good idea about the kind of games you're thinking about.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.460
Yeah. I mean, I can imagine we also talked a little bit about it.

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:40.300
It's super awesome. Good.

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:41.700
I did. So much good talks.

01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:43.140
All right. The juicy talks having you.

01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:44.580
She's like, I got to go set up.

01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:46.700
Well, you know, I already heard a lot.

01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.340
I mean, but that is a different kind of team you need to hire.

01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.980
Yeah. Is that a little

01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:57.540
nerve wracking, like going into a new field and trying to a little bit?

01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.460
But then I remind myself, like, like Steve Jobs didn't know how to code.

01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:03.460
Right. And, you know, he just he just knew what a good product was.

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:06.580
And I feel like as someone who wasted so much of his life playing video games,

01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.740
I have a good sense of it.

01:56:07.740 --> 01:56:08.740
And that might be ignorance.

01:56:08.740 --> 01:56:09.980
Well, that's really important, right?

01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:10.980
It's not about coding.

01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:12.260
It's about what makes for a good game.

01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:14.620
Exactly. And again, that might genuinely be ignorance.

01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:18.100
And maybe I end up, you know, can bend the butt because of what I'm saying now.

01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:20.980
But I think just like with YouTube,

01:56:20.980 --> 01:56:24.780
I just want to obsess over making a great product and things

01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:25.900
that I think my audience will love.

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:28.180
And I think as long as I keep that as my north star, it will do well.

01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.380
What is the path to being worth 100 billion look like?

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:35.460
There's a path to being worth 100 billion look like.

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:37.820
I don't know. OK, let me just like pause.

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:40.820
You're 24 and there's so much awesome scaling.

01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.740
So many great ideas.

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:45.340
Do you think about different trajectories?

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:48.500
Yeah, what those possible trajectories might look like.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:52.380
Yeah, I mean, if the goal was to just be worth 100 billion dollars.

01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:54.780
Yes, I'm my goal.

01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.500
I'm a broken record.

01:56:56.500 --> 01:56:59.180
So make the best video possible, because I know whatever else I want

01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:00.540
will come, obviously.

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.300
So the video is the foundation.

01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:02.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:06.220
So the path to 100 billion dollars is to keep getting 100 million views

01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:07.780
of video, you know what I mean?

01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.540
But or more or more.

01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.740
Exactly. If we can keep growing.

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:13.380
But, you know, if we can.

01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:15.340
Keep Feastables growing, right?

01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.140
And we eventually expand international.

01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:21.060
And one day we're in 100,000 retail locations and we're selling the same

01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:23.740
amount of skews or units per skews like we're currently doing.

01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.780
I mean, that would crush.

01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:29.220
And then obviously, ideally, one day we open up hundreds of beast burgers.

01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:32.780
We get it where we turn out, you know, like Supercell, a couple of hit games.

01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:34.820
I don't want to make dozens or hundreds of games.

01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:36.980
I just want to make games that are just great.

01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.980
And, you know, we rarely drop them what we do.

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:42.740
They're bangers and just, you know, whatever other stuff we end up doing.

01:57:43.140 --> 01:57:43.780
All that combined.

01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:47.540
I mean, it's just interesting because, like, what what's a show

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:50.100
that's pulled 100 million views per episode?

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.180
Basically, that's like we're doing.

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:54.580
Like, you know, I mean, like the Super Bowl gets praised

01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:56.820
because they get 100 million viewers, but I can't think of a show.

01:57:57.980 --> 01:57:59.540
Maybe in reruns or something.

01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:04.140
It's also a show that has a has a singular kind of figure.

01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:07.900
Yeah. You can now use as a like, I don't have a network telling me what to do.

01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:09.820
I don't have anyone like I can do whatever I want.

01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.900
So it's a very interesting position

01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.860
because I put out content and 100 million people show up.

01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:16.060
And then I also have a gaming channel.

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.300
I put out content and 15 million people show up in every action.

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:20.820
I put out content and 10 million people show up and have a tick tock.

01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:23.060
And I put out content and on average, 20 million people show up.

01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:27.780
And like and I so as long as I can keep that going and then we build these

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:31.980
businesses, it's like it's honestly pretty scary to see what will happen,

01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:36.860
you know, over the years, because Feastables launched, you know, last year, 2022.

01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:38.140
So it's a relatively new thing.

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:40.180
And Beast Warrior, we just started scaling up the physical side.

01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.140
And we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet.

01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:44.140
So I think I'm at the antithesis of it.

01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:47.780
I don't see a world where my YouTube channels are relevant in the next couple of years.

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.420
I just this is what I live for.

01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:52.380
And so if I can keep that going and then really start to expand

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.780
these businesses that leverage off of it, then yeah, I mean,

01:58:56.220 --> 01:58:59.580
hopefully there's a day one or I can give away a billion dollars in a video, honestly.

01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:02.580
That yeah, that would be one hell of a video.

01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:05.420
Let me ask you the ridiculous question.

01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:10.220
Since you went from being broke to being rich, although you keep

01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:13.100
spending all your money.

01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:16.300
But does money buy happiness?

01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:19.180
How has money changed sort of your

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.940
contentment, your happiness in life?

01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:24.900
It's money by happiness.

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:28.380
No, not I mean, to a point, yes.

01:59:28.540 --> 01:59:32.900
Once you can take care of your health, you can take care of like any immediate

01:59:32.900 --> 01:59:35.660
dangers and you can take care of your family relatively.

01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.900
No, it doesn't. Like, but those things do.

01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:41.060
Like when I first came into money, one of the first things I did was retire my mom.

01:59:41.300 --> 01:59:42.860
And like that brought me tons of happiness.

01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:46.340
You know what I mean? And like, you know, if my brother had a medical emergency

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:49.580
and and we couldn't afford it and I made money to afford it, that brings tons of happiness.

01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:51.740
You know, so once you take care of those basic necessities,

01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:53.860
so we'll say makeover, hypothetically, a million dollars.

01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:55.660
No, it really doesn't.

01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:59.380
Like adding an extra zero going from 10 million to 100 million or whatever it is

01:59:59.660 --> 02:00:01.220
makes no difference.

02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:04.900
So you're given that are just fearless in spending the money.

02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:06.300
Yeah. Well, let me reframe.

02:00:06.300 --> 02:00:10.220
I guess it could for some people, if if you really, I don't know,

02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:11.940
you spent your whole life obsessing over cars.

02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:14.300
It probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice Lamborghini.

02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:17.420
I'm coming more from the frame of mind of of an entrepreneur,

02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.100
someone who's really obsessed with business building.

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:21.540
For me and a lot of my friends and people I hang around,

02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:25.820
what brings us happiness is winning and building companies and do,

02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:28.020
you know, changing the world like that.

02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.820
That is fun. It's a complex problem.

02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:32.300
You can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over

02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:36.060
and devote your life to, where it's just having money doesn't, you know.

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:39.620
Well, one interesting question I have for you psychologically,

02:00:39.620 --> 02:00:42.820
so because you have become wealthy

02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:45.980
and because you give like part of your work is giving away a lot of money.

02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:50.220
Do you find it hard to find people you can trust?

02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:51.220
It's a question.

02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:55.460
Do people see you basically as a source of money, as opposed to another human being?

02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:57.980
It's weird because you would think yes,

02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:01.020
but I feel like I also know the right places to look.

02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:05.060
But yeah, if I just walked into Target and tried to make friends

02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:07.980
with 10 random people, of course, you got to.

02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:11.100
So you can kind of sense.

02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:11.900
Oh, yeah, you can.

02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:13.500
The right thing is so quickly.

02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:15.580
Yeah, that's yeah.

02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:16.420
It's so obvious.

02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:18.820
I don't even want to go into the descriptions, but

02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:22.980
honestly, a lot of my friends are like Chandler.

02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.940
I played Little League with him

02:01:25.940 --> 02:01:29.020
and Tyler, the guy, I mean, I went to school with him.

02:01:29.220 --> 02:01:31.900
Chris, he was my first subscriber.

02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:34.100
Carl was here after we got big, but whatever.

02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:35.260
He's friends with the boys.

02:01:35.260 --> 02:01:40.380
And it is a lot of my closer friends, even like my YouTube friends.

02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:42.020
I knew before I was big.

02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.060
So. Maybe there is some merit to that.

02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.300
Maybe it is. I don't know.

02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:47.620
I've never really put too much thought into it.

02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.700
And maybe there's a reason I hang around a lot of these people

02:01:49.700 --> 02:01:52.100
I knew before I got big, because it's much easier.

02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:57.460
And they help you keep like your radar sharp of who can and can't be trusted

02:01:57.460 --> 02:01:59.300
because, you know, you can trust them.

02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:02.020
It's difficult when you become richer and richer and more powerful.

02:02:02.300 --> 02:02:06.900
Well, one thing you'll also find when you get rich, not even richer, but more famous.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:10.820
One thing I thought is as I climbed this like ladder of YouTube and got bigger,

02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:12.780
I thought there would be tons of people like me.

02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:16.660
People like that take like the kamikaze approach to building a business.

02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:17.900
You just throw all your money in it.

02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:20.380
You throw all your time, you throw all your energy, you throw everything.

02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:21.860
You're just like, fuck it.

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:22.980
It's this or I'm dead.

02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:25.180
Yeah. I thought there would be hundreds of me.

02:02:25.180 --> 02:02:26.940
Yeah. And there isn't. There isn't.

02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:29.220
I mean, there's like maybe one or two.

02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:31.900
And I talk to those motherfuckers every single day.

02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:34.380
I'm sick and tired of talking to them, but I love them.

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:37.460
But it's just so interesting because like every level I got up,

02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.020
like I get a million subscribers.

02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.540
All right. Where's all these guys in the million subscribers

02:02:41.540 --> 02:02:42.740
that are fucking psychopaths?

02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:47.140
And then, you know, you know, people become like conservative as they get,

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:49.180
like they get more special as they get bigger.

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:51.460
Yeah. And, you know, 20 million subscribers,

02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:53.780
30. It's like every step of the way, it's like

02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.780
I just got more and more lonely to be honest.

02:02:56.780 --> 02:03:01.060
So, you know, it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies

02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:02.380
and you're like, oh, that's not how it works.

02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:05.860
But it is like there's there's just not many people

02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:07.860
that just want to give up everything, go all in,

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:10.700
then obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life.

02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.580
Like they're really hard to find.

02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:15.420
And be able to sacrifice everything for that video.

02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:18.620
Yeah. Basically, you put all the money right back in.

02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:21.180
Yeah. Or the people doing it, they're on just a small scale.

02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:24.860
And if I talk to them, it's just 99.9% of the time I'm teaching them things.

02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:28.940
And it's like so it's lonely because there's not too many people,

02:03:29.420 --> 02:03:31.700
especially in the creative space that is crazy as you.

02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:33.460
Yeah, it is 100%.

02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.260
It's it's so it's not what I was expecting.

02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:38.340
I was expecting there'd be a lot of people like me.

02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:41.620
But well, I guess the guy would talk to you almost

02:03:41.620 --> 02:03:43.460
because a bit like you in that sense.

02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:46.060
Yeah, just in a different domain. Yeah, exactly.

02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.260
Just willingness to put it all back in.

02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:51.220
And that's why I found right now, a lot of the people I relate to

02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:53.180
don't even make YouTube videos like that.

02:03:53.180 --> 02:03:57.340
Just like I'm veering more and more away from fellow content creators

02:03:57.340 --> 02:04:00.220
and more to just, you know, I'm just looking for those other people

02:04:00.220 --> 02:04:04.100
who just share a little bit of it so I don't feel so fucking crazy all the time.

02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:07.500
Like, you know, I mean, it's like people I feel normal around.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.820
They tend to just be doing the randomest things, but, you know, loving it.

02:04:10.980 --> 02:04:12.540
Well, I think that's really inspiring.

02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:16.300
It's it's like the Bukowski line.

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:19.740
Find what you love and let it kill you is really put everything.

02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.100
Put everything into the thing you love.

02:04:23.100 --> 02:04:25.140
That's like the way to really create special stuff.

02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:27.980
But it's also the way to live out your life.

02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:31.500
You have to be careful giving this advice because they're like

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:35.980
they're like bodybuilders who will be like, just go to the gym, be disciplined.

02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:37.220
I'm disciplined. Go to gym.

02:04:37.220 --> 02:04:41.340
But I would argue for those people, it's like it's not even discipline.

02:04:41.380 --> 02:04:43.620
They just enjoy weightlifting, right?

02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:45.980
Because there are people who are jacked,

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:48.300
but they don't make much money or run a business, right?

02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.620
If they're that discipline, they would they would be hitting every area of their life.

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:52.620
They just really like business.

02:04:52.620 --> 02:04:57.100
And there's people like me who just to an extreme level love building companies.

02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:58.540
Right. It's not even discipline for me.

02:04:58.540 --> 02:04:59.660
It's just in my blood.

02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:01.540
It's what I wake up. I don't think about it.

02:05:01.540 --> 02:05:02.260
I don't push myself.

02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.820
I don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work.

02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.540
I just do it. It's programmed in me at this point.

02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:10.300
And I couldn't imagine a world where I don't wake up and do it every day.

02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:15.540
But I think that a little bit of it is genetics.

02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:18.060
And just how you're hardwired.

02:05:18.060 --> 02:05:20.700
Not that it can't be trained or taught and not that, you know,

02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.980
and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things.

02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:24.540
And over time, I think can change it.

02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:27.220
But someone's just not going to be able to flip a switch

02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:30.260
and then just start doing a kamikaze approach to building a business.

02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.060
Just like a lot of people try to flip a switch and start bodybuilding

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.660
and quit majority of the time.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:36.780
You know, that's just not innate to them.

02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:40.340
But I think a lot of us have the capacity to do that in some domain.

02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:43.100
Yeah, I think if you went about it strategically, if you surrounded yourself

02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:47.180
with fellow like minded people and, you know, slowly over time, switched it.

02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:50.660
But if you just try to like hardcore do it, you're just going to lose your mind.

02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:54.100
Do you ever worry about your mental health?

02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:56.860
Did you take steps to protect it, to?

02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:02.020
Yeah, to like for the long run, to make sure you have the mental strength to go on.

02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:05.060
Yes, weirdly enough, the best thing for my mental health

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.060
was giving into my nature to work.

02:06:08.060 --> 02:06:11.460
And the most depressed I get is when I try to restrict it.

02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:13.860
And like, I don't work weekends or I don't work this day.

02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:16.660
What's best for me is just to work when I feel like working

02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:20.660
and then just not work when I don't like and just have no constraints.

02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.820
Because there are just some nights where I don't want to sleep.

02:06:22.860 --> 02:06:25.340
And for whatever reason, I feel compelled to go all night.

02:06:25.660 --> 02:06:27.180
Whatever. Like, just do it.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:31.780
You know, do whatever you want is what I tell my like working brain.

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:33.820
And I just give into it.

02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:35.460
And I feel that's where I feel the happiest.

02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:37.940
And and then, you know, it's typically like

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:41.300
and when I'm really in the grind mode, it'll be like seven or eight days.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.100
It's just nonstop going going.

02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:47.100
And it's like, oh, I'll realize like, oh, I need some recharge time

02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:49.500
and then go fucking binge a season of anime.

02:06:49.860 --> 02:06:51.660
Yeah, but but that's the thing.

02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:54.540
Like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.540
past this or blah, blah, give you all these constraints.

02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:59.740
But for me, and it's unconventional, I just give into it.

02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:02.900
I think there's something really to be said for that.

02:07:02.900 --> 02:07:06.540
I try to surround myself with people that like when I don't

02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:10.180
when I pull an all nighter, they don't go like you should get more sleep.

02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:12.300
There's a reason I pulled that all nighter.

02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:15.660
Like if I'm really passionate about something, they say they basically encourage it.

02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:19.940
Because I I have no problem getting sleep and getting rest.

02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:23.980
What I need in my life is people that encourage you to kind of keep going,

02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:26.180
keep going with the stuff you're passionate about.

02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:28.820
Normal people, they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't.

02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.540
It's not good for you.

02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:34.780
But yeah, is if you hang around people like just whatever different people,

02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:37.540
you're going to feel crazy and it's going to wear on you.

02:07:37.540 --> 02:07:40.060
Whereas if you're around similar people,

02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:41.540
it's just it's so much easier.

02:07:41.540 --> 02:07:46.380
Like if you, you know, I've started weightlifting more.

02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:49.460
And like one thing that's helped is just having jack people around.

02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.340
They naturally just eat healthier.

02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:55.540
They do. They naturally just have freaking grilled chicken and all this shit

02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:56.780
and high protein meals.

02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:58.700
And it's just like easier for me to just piggyback.

02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:01.180
I'm like, oh, can you just order me whatever you're getting?

02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:04.140
And they're like, I got to go to the gym and I'll be like, oh, shit, I'll just join you.

02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.620
You know, and it's like it's just it's cheat codes.

02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:08.900
You know, you just surround yourself with people that you want to be.

02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:11.580
And it makes it like 70 percent easier, in my opinion.

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:14.380
It's like that is the cheat code to life.

02:08:14.380 --> 02:08:17.820
And I wish I obviously your audience is definitely a lot older.

02:08:17.820 --> 02:08:21.540
But, you know, to the older people listening, like if you have are in a place

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:24.380
of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people,

02:08:24.740 --> 02:08:26.900
you should really try to drill that in their heads.

02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:30.060
Like the people they are around 100 percent dictates the outcome.

02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:33.420
I would I would not be on 120 million subscribers if I didn't find

02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.260
when I was around a million.

02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:37.620
I had a couple of friends that were just also psychopaths.

02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:39.540
You know, I outgrew them.

02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:41.260
But at the time, it was great.

02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:44.300
And I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for them.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:48.100
And just all along the way, the friends that I hung out with

02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:50.900
had such a dramatic impact on where I am.

02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:54.860
Like I probably have 80 million less subscribers, you know, if it was

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:58.060
if I wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that I add value to

02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:59.140
and they also add value to me.

02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.900
So the advice for young people would be to be very selective about the people.

02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:06.500
You saw so selective. It's it's crazy.

02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:11.180
Like Chris, you know, he's I I he's really funny.

02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:12.580
And that's why he's great for the videos.

02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:15.700
And part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons

02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:17.220
and just funny content.

02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:20.060
And so I'll find like when I spend more time with Chris,

02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:23.380
I'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows.

02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:26.980
And like my speech will literally change just after like a week

02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:28.260
of spending more time with him.

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:30.340
It has like it's like that quick out of effect.

02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:33.260
You know, now picture that over the course of years.

02:09:33.260 --> 02:09:35.260
I mean, yeah, it has such a huge influence.

02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:38.580
Like pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there.

02:09:38.580 --> 02:09:42.340
And, you know, there's no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator,

02:09:42.460 --> 02:09:44.340
their odds of success is 10 X. Right.

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:45.620
Obviously, you can't do that.

02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:49.300
But you got to find your closest version of it and just be selective.

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:53.260
Yeah. But this also applies not to see younger to older people to agree.

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:58.540
But it's it's even more I like when I was a teenager, I just, you know,

02:09:58.540 --> 02:09:59.740
I couldn't relate to many people.

02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.660
I just I was like a fucking freak of nature because no one was obsessed

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.940
with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff.

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:08.100
And so like back then, you know, that advice would have been helpful.

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:11.500
Maybe not that particularly, but just knowing that there are it's

02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:12.620
not that you're a freak of nature.

02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:14.580
You just haven't found people that have the same interest.

02:10:14.580 --> 02:10:18.180
So the task is not to feel sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself.

02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:20.020
It's more to find the people you fit in with.

02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:24.100
Yeah. I mean, assuming which, you know, you're not getting complimented.

02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.980
Like, I assume it's not something bad.

02:10:28.420 --> 02:10:32.180
If your hobby is shooting things or shooting things, you shouldn't be shooting.

02:10:32.180 --> 02:10:34.060
You know, don't find people that encourage that.

02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:38.940
But outside of that, for sure.

02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:41.900
Actually, as an answer to what is the best advice someone ever gave you,

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.540
you said you're crazy until you're successful.

02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:46.500
Then you're a genius. 100 percent.

02:10:46.500 --> 02:10:49.140
All along the way, people gave me so much.

02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:54.140
You know, advice on why I shouldn't be doing it, why I'm crazy.

02:10:54.460 --> 02:10:57.380
Every step of the way, people wanted to tell me why I shouldn't be doing this

02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:59.980
and should get a life, should stop being too obsessed, everything,

02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:01.740
everything under the book.

02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:03.780
And then once I'm successful, those same people are like, dang,

02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:06.500
you're a genius.

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:08.540
Wow. You really you pulled that off.

02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:10.500
Those are probably the same people that will give you advice.

02:11:10.500 --> 02:11:15.220
Now, you're the most successful video creator of all time.

02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:18.380
Stick to that any time you want to do something new, right?

02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:21.860
They'll they'll like pressure you not to do,

02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:28.220
you know, feastables or or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond.

02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:30.580
Yeah, it's funny how people don't.

02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:32.620
Well, honestly, the type of people I just don't talk to anymore.

02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:35.380
I don't even know what they have to say now.

02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:37.500
So most people on the team are like, yes.

02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:40.900
And they're like, whatever the idea you got, they they're with it.

02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:42.460
No, I mean, it's weird.

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.740
We actually have a my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore.

02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:48.380
Which I want. I don't want yes, man.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:54.420
And they're like they're James, you know, the CEO who helped me build all this.

02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:56.900
He's very adamant, like we're not yes, man.

02:11:56.900 --> 02:11:59.220
And and he trains people to really think for themselves.

02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:01.860
And even when I give them orders, like really think like, is this optimal?

02:12:01.980 --> 02:12:04.580
Is there context or information Jimmy could be missing that I can provide

02:12:04.580 --> 02:12:06.620
that can help him make a more updated decision?

02:12:06.620 --> 02:12:08.900
Like, I'm not God, you know what I mean?

02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:10.300
Like, I'm human and I make errors.

02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.620
And so don't take what I say as the Bible.

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:17.140
So even like in the brainstorming and so on, they can they can push back.

02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:18.300
Yeah, you can see it like Tyler.

02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:21.140
Anytime I said something, he would give me feedback and push back, which is what I want.

02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.700
I don't want him just to be like, yes, you're a fucking genius.

02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:25.620
Good job, Jimmy. You know, I don't need that.

02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.940
You know, I need negatives.

02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:31.500
You talked about being in a relationship.

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:35.020
What role, Jimmy, does love play in the human condition?

02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:42.180
I think. Well, the big thing is that love can be scary because this is, you know,

02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:45.700
the human you're going to spend the most amount of time with in your life, you know,

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:48.660
and so for project that over 50 years, they can be a liability or an asset.

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.620
I love the metrics. You know, I love.

02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:53.460
No, but seriously, it's got to be someone that makes you better.

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:56.460
For me, I can't truly love someone that doesn't make me better because.

02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:57.580
Yeah. In the long run.

02:12:57.580 --> 02:12:58.660
Yeah. Across across.

02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:00.860
Because if not, then it's like it's a negative.

02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:03.740
You know, to everything I've spent my life building.

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:07.860
But luckily, I'm very happy with the partner I haven't like we were talking about before.

02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:09.100
I do think she makes me better.

02:13:09.100 --> 02:13:12.780
There's a lot of actually positives I've noticed, even things as simple as like,

02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:16.420
you know, I struggle to turn off my brain at night because I'm just thinking about all the businesses

02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:19.420
and how we could do better or whatever weird thing I have on my mind.

02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:23.100
But, you know, just chatting with her and hanging out with her helps me, like,

02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:26.260
basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out.

02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:30.380
And even like there's just a ton of little things like that that I've noticed are are positives,

02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:35.220
especially when you really look for them, that are easy to gloss over if you're not.

02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:39.540
And so for me, yeah, I have someone who I think is very beautiful, very intelligent,

02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:44.140
makes me better, constantly pushing me, OK with me, working hard, makes me smarter.

02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:50.060
And just all these different things that I think for me, love just makes me a better person.

02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:52.220
You know what I mean? Which makes me love her even more.

02:13:52.220 --> 02:13:53.380
Does that make sense?

02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:59.140
Absolutely. What advice would you give on finding somebody like that?

02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:03.860
Just really don't give up until you find someone that, you know,

02:14:03.860 --> 02:14:06.580
there's so many people on the planet. I mean, there really is.

02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:10.300
There there's billions of the odds are in your favor of.

02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:17.860
Yeah, like, just don't settle and find someone that, you know, makes you happy.

02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:22.220
Yeah, just like you said, surround yourself with people that make you a better person.

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:27.100
In the same case, surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person.

02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:29.220
And maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain looking at it.

02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:31.020
Not everyone wants to hyper optimize their life like me.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:34.380
But for me to like truly love someone, they have to make me a better person.

02:14:34.380 --> 02:14:36.620
In every way. Yeah. Yeah.

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:38.740
Well, what do you hope you're 24?

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:42.500
We started talking about death. Let's let's let's finish talking about death.

02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:44.260
What do you hope your legacy is?

02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:47.620
When you when we look a hundred years from now and the alien,

02:14:47.620 --> 02:14:52.420
the AI has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the AI

02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:56.380
what this last of special humans that existed on Earth was like.

02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:58.380
What do you hope they say about you?

02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:11.420
It's a deep one.

02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.500
Probably just that because it's hard, right?

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:18.540
Like I said before, Elon is over double my age.

02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:22.420
I could live every second I've lived up to this point in my life and still not even be Elon's age.

02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:24.020
So I have so much time.

02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:27.700
I just hope whatever it is that it's a net positive on the world

02:15:27.700 --> 02:15:35.900
and it impacts billions of people in a positive way that makes lasting change.

02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:42.940
So you admire people like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk for having sort of reached for that goal as well.

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.540
Yeah, of course. To help to help millions.

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:47.820
I mean, the iPhone is the most successful product ever invented.

02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:51.260
It's hard not to admire what he created.

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:54.060
The same with sort of as Johnny Ive talks about,

02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:59.780
like the passion, the effort they put into the designing the iPhone.

02:15:59.780 --> 02:16:02.860
That like little bit of love is transferred to the whole world.

02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:05.060
Like they get to experience the joy of that from the designer.

02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:07.220
It's what a beautiful thing to do.

02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:12.900
You know, I couldn't think of anything better, you know, to create something that even after you're dead for decades

02:16:12.900 --> 02:16:17.060
just has such a profound impact on basically half the human population.

02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:18.420
Yeah, it's wild.

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.700
Brings joy to people.

02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:22.020
Well, I hope you do just that, man.

02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:25.020
You've already done it for millions and millions and millions and millions of people.

02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:26.660
And I hope you keep doing it.

02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:31.980
I can't like it's so exciting to see what happens this year and next year.

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:34.140
Like the sky's the limit.

02:16:34.140 --> 02:16:41.340
I can't. I mean, the videos, but all the other businesses you're in and you as a human being, as you grow,

02:16:41.340 --> 02:16:46.940
I can tell, I know, as everyone knows, you have a kind heart and the fact that you're really damn good

02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:52.020
at actually using that kind heart to help a lot of people is awesome to see, man.

02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:55.980
I appreciate it. More importantly, before we go, are we going to play Dune tonight?

02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:56.460
Some board games?

02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:59.260
I'm not going to play Dune. I have one hour.

02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:00.860
You don't want to play board games with me?

02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:03.580
I want to. I'll play board games.

02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:05.660
You don't want to play board games?

02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:10.740
If only I wasn't an idiot and actually flew to the right airport.

02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:15.700
If you don't play board games with me, they're going to dislike the video.

02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:18.340

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:34.380
Reach high for stars lie hidden in you.
