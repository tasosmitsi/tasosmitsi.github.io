00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
The following is a conversation with Norman Neymarck,

00:03.360 --> 00:05.360
a historian at Stanford specializing

00:05.360 --> 00:09.360
in genocide, war, and empire.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.560
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.040
in the description.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.920
And now, here's my conversation with Norman Neymarck.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.480
Did Stalin believe that communism was good,

00:22.480 --> 00:25.360
not just for him, but for the people of the Soviet Union

00:25.360 --> 00:26.920
and the people of the world?

00:26.960 --> 00:27.880
Oh, absolutely.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.760
I mean, Stalin believed that socialism was the be-all

00:32.760 --> 00:36.800
and end-all of human existence.

00:36.800 --> 00:40.080
He was a true Leninist, and in Lenin's tradition,

00:40.080 --> 00:43.200
this was what he believed.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.360
I mean, that set of beliefs didn't exclude

00:46.360 --> 00:49.880
other kinds of things he believed or thought or did.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.960
But no, the way he defined socialism,

00:53.960 --> 00:56.080
the way he thought about socialism,

00:56.120 --> 00:57.760
he absolutely thought it was in the interest

00:57.760 --> 00:59.520
of the Soviet Union and of the world.

00:59.520 --> 01:01.760
And in fact, that the world was, one day,

01:01.760 --> 01:03.360
going to go socialist.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.640
In other words, I think he believed eventually

01:06.640 --> 01:08.240
in the international revolution.

01:09.280 --> 01:13.880
So given the genocide in the 1930s that you described,

01:13.880 --> 01:17.440
was Stalin evil, delusional, or incompetent?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.520
Evil, delusional, or incompetent.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.560
Well, you know, evil is one of those words,

01:25.720 --> 01:30.720
which has a lot of religious and moral connotations.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.320
And in that sense, yes, I think he was an evil man.

01:33.320 --> 01:38.320
I mean, he eliminated people absolutely unnecessarily.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.120
He tortured people, had people tortured.

01:43.040 --> 01:48.040
He was completely indifferent to the suffering of others.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.000
He couldn't have carried a wit

01:51.080 --> 01:54.880
that millions were suffering.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.600
And so, yes, I consider him an evil man.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.160
I mean, you know, historians don't like to

02:01.160 --> 02:02.840
use the word evil. Use the word evil.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.400
It's, you know, it's a word for moral philosophers,

02:05.400 --> 02:10.400
but I think it certainly fits who he is.

02:11.640 --> 02:14.080
I think he was delusional.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.000
And there is a wonderful historian in Princeton,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.680
a political scientist, actually, named Robert Tucker,

02:20.680 --> 02:24.000
who said he suffered from a paranoid,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.480
delusional system.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.360
And I always remember that of Tucker's writing

02:30.360 --> 02:35.280
because what Tucker meant is that he was not just paranoid,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.640
meaning, you know, I'm paranoid,

02:37.640 --> 02:39.960
I'm worried you're out to get me, right?

02:39.960 --> 02:44.960
But that he constructed a whole plots of people,

02:47.480 --> 02:51.360
whole systems of people who were out to get him.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.760
So in other words, his delusions were

02:53.760 --> 02:56.600
that there were all of these groups of people out there

02:58.040 --> 03:00.680
who were out to diminish his power

03:00.680 --> 03:04.440
and remove him from his position

03:04.440 --> 03:07.400
and undermine the Soviet Union in his view.

03:07.400 --> 03:12.400
So, yes, I think he did suffer from delusions.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.880
And this had a huge effect because whole groups then

03:16.880 --> 03:20.960
were destroyed by his activities,

03:20.960 --> 03:25.960
which he would construct based on these delusions.

03:26.160 --> 03:27.400
He was not incompetent.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.400
He was an extremely competent man.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.720
I mean, I think most of the research that's gone on,

03:32.720 --> 03:36.880
especially since the Stalin archive was opened

03:36.880 --> 03:38.840
at the beginning of the century,

03:38.840 --> 03:41.760
and I think almost every historian who goes in that archive

03:41.760 --> 03:44.440
comes away from it with the feeling

03:44.440 --> 03:48.920
of a man who is enormously hardworking, intelligent,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.920
with an acute sense of politics,

03:51.920 --> 03:56.920
a really excellent sense of political rhetoric,

03:58.120 --> 04:02.200
a fantastic editor in a kind of agitational sense.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.480
I mean, he's a real agitator, right?

04:04.480 --> 04:09.280
And of a really hard worker.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.920
I mean, somebody who works from morning till night,

04:11.920 --> 04:14.720
a micromanager in some ways.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.840
So his competence, I think, was really extreme.

04:17.840 --> 04:20.760
Now there were times when that fell down,

04:20.760 --> 04:23.560
times in the thirties, times in the twenties,

04:23.560 --> 04:26.240
times during the war where he made mistakes.

04:26.240 --> 04:28.960
It's not as if he didn't make any mistakes,

04:28.960 --> 04:31.520
but I think you look at his stuff,

04:31.520 --> 04:34.160
you look at his archives, you look what he did.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.760
I mean, this is an enormously competent man

04:36.760 --> 04:41.360
who in many, many different areas of enterprise,

04:41.360 --> 04:44.880
because he had this notion that he should know everything

04:44.880 --> 04:46.640
and did know everything.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.280
I remember one archive, Dielad's,

04:50.280 --> 04:52.360
called a kind of folder that I looked at

04:52.360 --> 04:56.280
where he actually went through the wines

04:56.280 --> 04:59.480
that were produced in his native Georgia

04:59.480 --> 05:03.360
and wrote down how much they should make

05:03.360 --> 05:05.080
of each of these wines,

05:05.080 --> 05:10.040
how many barrels they should produce of these wines,

05:10.040 --> 05:12.200
which grapes were better than the other grapes,

05:12.200 --> 05:14.320
sort of correcting, in other words,

05:14.320 --> 05:16.680
what people were putting down there.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.840
So he was, you know, his competence ranged very wide,

05:20.840 --> 05:23.480
or at least he thought his competence ranged very wide.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.720
I mean, both things, I think, are the case.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.840
If we look at this paranoid delusional system,

05:27.840 --> 05:29.840
Stalin was in power for 30 years.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.960
He is, many argue, one of the most powerful men in history.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.600
Did, in his case, absolute power corrupt him,

05:38.600 --> 05:41.000
or did it reveal the true nature of the man?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.480
And maybe just in your sense,

05:43.480 --> 05:47.480
as we kind of build around this genocide of the early 1930s,

05:48.600 --> 05:50.320
this paranoid delusional system,

05:50.320 --> 05:52.800
did it get built up over time?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.600
Was it always there?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.880
It's kind of a question of,

05:58.440 --> 06:02.440
did the genocide, was that always inevitable, essentially,

06:02.440 --> 06:05.920
in this man, or did power create that?

06:05.920 --> 06:08.480
I mean, it's a great question, and I don't think you can,

06:08.480 --> 06:11.080
I don't think you can say that it was always

06:12.040 --> 06:14.360
kind of inherent in the man.

06:14.360 --> 06:18.600
I mean, the man without his position and without his power,

06:18.600 --> 06:20.960
you know, wouldn't have been able to accomplish

06:20.960 --> 06:24.920
what he eventually did in the way of murdering people,

06:24.920 --> 06:26.440
you know, murdering groups of people,

06:26.440 --> 06:28.720
which is what genocide is.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.640
So, you know, I don't, it wasn't sort of in him.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.040
I mean, there were, and again, you know,

06:34.040 --> 06:36.880
the new research has shown that, you know,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.520
he had his childhood was, you know,

06:39.520 --> 06:43.280
not a particularly nasty one, and people used to say,

06:43.280 --> 06:45.760
you know, the father beat him up,

06:45.760 --> 06:47.520
and it turns out actually it wasn't the father,

06:47.520 --> 06:49.360
it was the mother once in a while.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.760
But basically, you know,

06:50.760 --> 06:55.760
he was not an unusual young Georgian kid or student even.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.080
And, you know, it was the growth of the Soviet system,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.720
and him within the Soviet system,

07:04.760 --> 07:07.840
I mean, his own development within the Soviet system,

07:07.840 --> 07:09.960
I think that led, you know,

07:09.960 --> 07:14.960
to the kind of mass killing that occurred in the 1930s.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.760
You know, he essentially achieved complete power

07:19.760 --> 07:24.760
by the early 1930s, and then as he rolled with it,

07:25.680 --> 07:28.200
as you would say, you know, or people would say,

07:29.520 --> 07:32.800
you know, it increasingly became murderous,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.920
and there was no, you know,

07:35.920 --> 07:37.960
there were no checks and balances obviously

07:37.960 --> 07:40.960
on that murderous system, and not only that,

07:40.960 --> 07:44.960
you know, people supported it in the NKVD and elsewhere,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.880
and he learned how to manipulate people.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.680
I mean, he was a superb, you know,

07:49.680 --> 07:54.680
political manipulator of those people around him.

07:54.720 --> 07:59.720
And, you know, we have, we've got new transcripts,

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
we've got new transcripts, for example,

08:01.720 --> 08:05.840
of, you know, a Politburo meetings in the early 1930s,

08:05.840 --> 08:07.680
and you read those things and you read, you know,

08:07.680 --> 08:12.680
he uses humor and he uses sarcasm especially,

08:12.840 --> 08:17.160
he uses verbal ways to undermine people, you know,

08:17.160 --> 08:20.760
to control their behavior and what they do,

08:20.760 --> 08:25.440
and he's a really, you know, he's a real,

08:25.440 --> 08:27.400
I guess, manipulator is the right word,

08:27.400 --> 08:31.600
and he does it, he does it with, you know,

08:31.600 --> 08:36.080
a kind of skill that on the one hand is admirable,

08:36.080 --> 08:39.920
and on the other hand, of course, is terrible

08:39.920 --> 08:41.760
because it ends up, you know,

08:41.760 --> 08:46.480
creating the system of terror that he creates.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.600
I mean, I guess just to linger on it,

08:50.600 --> 08:53.280
I just wonder how much of it is a slippery slope.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.480
In the early 20s, 1920s,

08:57.480 --> 08:59.440
did he think he was going to be murdering

08:59.440 --> 09:04.440
even a single person, but thousands and millions?

09:06.080 --> 09:07.360
I just wonder,

09:10.760 --> 09:14.080
maybe the murder of a single human being

09:14.080 --> 09:16.640
just to get them, you know,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.480
because you're paranoid about them

09:18.480 --> 09:19.920
potentially threatening your power,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.240
does that murder and open a door?

09:22.280 --> 09:23.960
And once you open the door,

09:23.960 --> 09:25.960
you become a different human being.

09:25.960 --> 09:29.080
A deeper question here is the Solzhenitsyn,

09:29.080 --> 09:30.760
you know, the line between good and evil

09:30.760 --> 09:32.120
runs in every man.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.760
Are all of us, once we commit one murder in this situation,

09:35.760 --> 09:38.040
does that open a door for all of us?

09:38.040 --> 09:41.720
And I guess even the further deeper question is

09:41.720 --> 09:44.960
how easy it is for human nature

09:44.960 --> 09:49.040
to go on the slippery slope that ends in genocide?

09:49.120 --> 09:52.360
There are a lot of questions in those questions.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.920
And, you know, the slippery slope question

09:55.920 --> 09:59.160
I would answer, I suppose, by saying,

10:00.200 --> 10:04.080
you know, Stalin wasn't the most likely successor of Lenin.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.040
There were plenty of others.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.600
There were a lot of political contingencies

10:09.600 --> 10:12.680
that emerged in the 1920s

10:12.680 --> 10:16.640
that made it possible for Stalin to seize power.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.880
I don't think of him as, you know,

10:19.880 --> 10:22.880
if you would just know him in 1925,

10:22.880 --> 10:25.960
I don't think anybody would say much less himself

10:25.960 --> 10:28.840
that this was a future mass murderer.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.040
I mean, Trotsky mistrusted him

10:31.040 --> 10:36.040
and thought he was, you know, a mindless bureaucrat.

10:36.400 --> 10:39.560
You know, others were less mistrustful of him,

10:39.560 --> 10:41.800
but, you know, he managed to gain power

10:41.800 --> 10:43.640
in the way he did through this bureaucratic

10:43.640 --> 10:48.000
and political maneuvering that was very successful.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.040
You know, the slippery slope, as it were,

10:52.040 --> 10:55.640
doesn't really begin until the 1930s in my view.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.880
In other words, once he gains complete power

10:58.880 --> 11:01.400
and control of the Politburo,

11:01.400 --> 11:05.920
once the programs that he institutes

11:05.920 --> 11:10.160
of the five-year plan and collectivization go through,

11:10.160 --> 11:14.080
once he reverses himself and is able to reverse himself

11:14.080 --> 11:17.200
or reverse the Soviet path, you know,

11:17.200 --> 11:20.600
to give various nationalities their, you know,

11:20.600 --> 11:23.000
their ability to develop their own cultures

11:23.000 --> 11:26.680
and sort of internal politics.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.040
Once he reverses all that, you know,

11:29.040 --> 11:32.200
you have the Ukrainian famine in 32, 33.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.480
You have the murder of Kirov,

11:34.480 --> 11:38.120
who is one of the leading figures, you know,

11:38.120 --> 11:39.600
in the political system.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.120
You have the suicide of his wife.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.520
You have all these things come together in 32, 33

11:45.520 --> 11:50.520
that then, you know, make it more likely,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.960
in other words, that bad things are gonna happen.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.800
And people start seeing that too around him.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.920
They start seeing that it's not a slippery slope.

12:00.920 --> 12:05.920
It's a dangerous situation which is emerging.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.360
And some people really understand that.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.760
So I really do see a differentiation then

12:11.760 --> 12:13.080
between the 20s.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.720
I mean, it's true that Stalin during the Civil War,

12:15.720 --> 12:18.600
there's a lot of, you know, good research on that,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.440
you know, shows that he already had

12:21.440 --> 12:24.760
some of these characteristics of being,

12:24.760 --> 12:28.120
as it were, murderous and being, you know,

12:28.120 --> 12:32.320
being dictatorial and pushing people around

12:32.320 --> 12:33.160
and that sort of thing.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.480
That was all there.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.640
But I don't really see that as kind of the necessary stage

12:38.640 --> 12:41.600
for the next thing that came, which was the 30s,

12:41.600 --> 12:44.760
which was really terror of the worst sort,

12:44.760 --> 12:47.320
you know, where everybody's afraid for their lives

12:47.320 --> 12:49.520
and most people are afraid for their lives

12:49.520 --> 12:52.320
and their family's lives and where torture

12:52.320 --> 12:54.960
and that sort of thing becomes a common part,

12:54.960 --> 12:58.320
you know, of what people had to face.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.080
So it's a different world.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.760
And, you know, people will argue,

13:03.240 --> 13:08.240
they'll argue this kind of Lenin-Stalin continuity debate,

13:08.240 --> 13:09.360
you know, that's been going on

13:09.360 --> 13:11.360
since I was an undergraduate, right?

13:11.360 --> 13:14.240
That argument, you know, was Stalin the natural

13:14.240 --> 13:17.280
sort of next step from Lenin

13:17.280 --> 13:19.280
or was he something completely different?

13:21.280 --> 13:22.560
Many people will argue, you know,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.840
because of Marxism, Leninism, because of the ideology,

13:25.840 --> 13:28.960
that, you know, it was the next natural,

13:28.960 --> 13:30.880
it was a kind of natural next step.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.960
It was a kind of natural next step, I don't think so,

13:33.960 --> 13:36.320
you know, and I would tend to lean the other way,

13:36.320 --> 13:40.160
not absolutely, I mean, I won't make an absolute argument

13:40.160 --> 13:43.560
that what Stalin became had nothing to do with Lenin

13:43.560 --> 13:45.600
and nothing to do with Marxism, Leninism,

13:45.600 --> 13:47.400
it had a lot to do with it.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.600
But, you know, he takes it one major step further.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.840
And again, that's why I don't like the slippery slope,

13:53.840 --> 13:55.600
you know, metaphor, because that means

13:55.600 --> 13:57.280
it's kind of slow and easy.

13:57.280 --> 14:00.280
It's a leap and we call, you know,

14:00.280 --> 14:03.400
I mean, historians talk about the Stalin revolution,

14:03.400 --> 14:06.000
you know, in 28 and 29, you know,

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
that he, in some senses, creates a whole new system,

14:11.200 --> 14:14.320
you know, through the five-year plan, collectivization,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.760
and seizing political power the way he does.

14:17.840 --> 14:19.480
Can you talk about the 1930s?

14:19.480 --> 14:21.720
Can you describe what happened in Holodomor,

14:21.720 --> 14:25.240
the Soviet terror famine in Ukraine in 32 and 33?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.080
Yes.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.240
That killed millions of Ukrainians.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.760
Right, it's a long story, you know,

14:29.760 --> 14:34.160
but let me try to be as succinct as I can be.

14:34.160 --> 14:39.160
I mean, the Holodomor, the terror famine of 32, 33

14:40.240 --> 14:45.240
comes out of in part an all-union famine

14:46.160 --> 14:49.840
that is the result of collectivization.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.240
You know, collectivization was a catastrophe.

14:53.160 --> 14:56.080
You know, the more or less of the so-called kulaks,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.040
the more or less richer farmers,

14:58.040 --> 15:00.240
I mean, they weren't really rich, right?

15:00.240 --> 15:03.200
Anybody with a tin roof and a cow was considered a kulak,

15:03.200 --> 15:05.120
you know, and other people who had nothing

15:05.120 --> 15:06.440
were also considered kulaks

15:06.440 --> 15:09.200
if they opposed collectivization.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.400
So these kulaks, we're talking millions of them, right?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.120
And Ukraine, it's worth recalling,

15:15.120 --> 15:16.520
and I'm sure you know this,

15:16.520 --> 15:19.240
was a, you know, heavily agricultural area,

15:19.240 --> 15:22.560
and Ukrainian peasants, you know,

15:22.560 --> 15:27.160
were in the countryside and resisted collectivization

15:27.160 --> 15:32.120
more than even Russian peasants resisted collectivization,

15:33.160 --> 15:35.520
suffered during this collectivization program,

15:35.520 --> 15:38.640
and they, you know, burned sometimes their own houses,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.560
they killed their own animals.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.120
They were shot, you know, sometimes on the spot.

15:46.280 --> 15:50.040
Tens of thousands and others were sent into exile.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.120
So there was a conflagration in the countryside,

15:53.120 --> 15:56.280
and the result of that conflagration in Ukraine

15:56.280 --> 15:58.160
was terrible famine.

15:58.160 --> 16:01.080
And again, there was famine all over the Soviet Union,

16:01.080 --> 16:04.880
but it was especially bad in Ukraine,

16:04.880 --> 16:07.960
in part because Ukrainian peasants resisted.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.760
Now, in 32, 33, a couple of things happened.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.560
I mean, I've argued this in my writing,

16:14.560 --> 16:18.240
and, you know, I've also worked on this.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.040
I continue to work on it, by the way,

16:20.040 --> 16:23.360
with a museum in Kiev

16:23.360 --> 16:25.560
that's going to be about the Holodomor.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.520
They're building the museum now,

16:27.520 --> 16:32.040
and it's going to be a very impressive set of exhibits,

16:32.040 --> 16:34.320
and talk with historians all the time about it.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.400
So what happens in 32, 33, a couple of things.

16:37.400 --> 16:42.400
First of all, the Stalin develops an even stronger,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.640
I say even stronger because they already had an antipathy

16:47.640 --> 16:50.960
for the Ukrainians, an even stronger antipathy

16:50.960 --> 16:53.120
for the Ukrainians in general.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.040
First of all, they resist collectivization.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.120
Second of all, he's not getting all the grain he wants

16:59.120 --> 17:02.040
out of them, and which he needs.

17:02.040 --> 17:07.040
And so he sends in then people to expropriate the grain

17:07.080 --> 17:09.480
and take the grain away from the peasants.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.840
These teams of people, you know, some policemen,

17:12.840 --> 17:16.560
some urban thugs, some party people,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.320
some poor peasants, you know, take part too,

17:19.320 --> 17:23.880
go into the villages and forcibly seize grain

17:23.880 --> 17:28.480
and animals from the Ukrainian peasantry.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.920
They're seizing it all over.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.960
I mean, let's remember again,

17:30.960 --> 17:34.760
this is all over the Soviet Union in 32 especially.

17:36.560 --> 17:41.560
Then, you know, in December of 1932, January of 33,

17:42.360 --> 17:47.360
February of 33, Stalin is convinced the Ukrainian peasantry

17:47.800 --> 17:51.760
needs to be shown who's boss,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.640
that they're not turning over their grain,

17:55.640 --> 17:57.920
that they're resisting the expropriators,

17:57.920 --> 18:01.520
that they're hiding the grain, which they do sometimes, right?

18:01.520 --> 18:05.640
That they're basically not loyal to the Soviet Union,

18:05.640 --> 18:07.560
that they're acting like traitors,

18:07.560 --> 18:10.400
that they're ready, and he says this, you know,

18:10.400 --> 18:12.640
I think it's Kaganovich, he says it too.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.280
You know, they're ready to kind of pull out

18:14.280 --> 18:15.920
of the Soviet Union and join Poland.

18:15.920 --> 18:20.440
I mean, he thinks Poland is out to get Ukraine.

18:20.440 --> 18:22.840
And so he's gonna then essentially break

18:22.840 --> 18:24.040
the back of these peasantry.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.720
And the way he breaks their back

18:26.960 --> 18:30.560
is by going through another expropriation program,

18:30.560 --> 18:33.400
which is not done in the rest of the Soviet Union.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.280
So he's taking away everything they have,

18:36.280 --> 18:37.320
everything they have.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.160
There are new laws introduced

18:40.160 --> 18:42.760
where they will actually punish people,

18:42.760 --> 18:47.680
including kids, with death if they steal any grain,

18:47.680 --> 18:51.200
you know, if they take anything from the fields.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.760
So, you know, you can shoot anybody,

18:53.760 --> 18:55.760
you know, who is looking for food.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.840
And then he introduces measures in Ukraine,

18:58.840 --> 19:00.160
which are not introduced

19:00.160 --> 19:02.200
into the rest of the Soviet Union.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.280
For example, the Ukrainian peasantry

19:05.280 --> 19:07.960
are not allowed to leave their villages anymore.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.200
They can't go to the city to try to find some things.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.040
I mean, we've got pictures of, you know,

19:13.040 --> 19:15.920
Ukrainian peasants dying on the sidewalks

19:15.920 --> 19:19.600
in Kharkiv and in Kiev and places like that,

19:19.600 --> 19:21.280
who've managed to get out of the village

19:21.280 --> 19:22.120
and get to the cities.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.080
But now they can't leave.

19:24.080 --> 19:29.080
They can't leave Ukraine to go to Belarus today,

19:29.640 --> 19:32.840
or to Russia, you know, to get any food.

19:32.840 --> 19:36.800
There's no, he won't allow any relief to Ukraine.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.640
Number of people offer relief, including the Poles,

19:39.640 --> 19:42.160
but also the Vatican offers relief.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.480
He won't allow any relief to Ukraine.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.320
He won't admit that there's a famine in Ukraine.

19:47.320 --> 19:52.320
And instead what happens is that Ukraine turns into,

19:52.640 --> 19:57.040
the Ukrainian countryside turns into what my now

19:58.320 --> 20:00.680
past colleague who died several years ago,

20:00.680 --> 20:04.520
Robert Conquest called a vast Belson.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.360
And by that, you know,

20:05.360 --> 20:09.200
the images of bodies just lying everywhere, you know,

20:09.200 --> 20:14.200
people dead and dying, you know, of hunger,

20:14.640 --> 20:18.320
which is by the way, I mean, as you know,

20:18.320 --> 20:20.800
I've spent a lot of time studying genocide.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.080
I don't think there's anything worse

20:22.080 --> 20:24.480
than dying of hunger from what I have read.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.600
I mean, you see terrible ways that people die, right?

20:27.600 --> 20:31.640
But dying of hunger is just such a horrible, horrible thing.

20:31.640 --> 20:36.160
And so, for example, we know there were many cases

20:36.160 --> 20:37.680
of cannibalism in the countryside

20:37.720 --> 20:39.240
because there wasn't anything to eat.

20:39.240 --> 20:42.320
People were eating their own kids, right?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.600
And Stalin knew about this.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.920
And again, you know,

20:44.920 --> 20:46.920
we started with this question a little bit earlier.

20:46.920 --> 20:51.680
He doesn't, there's not a sign of remorse,

20:51.680 --> 20:54.400
not a sign of pity, right?

20:54.400 --> 20:59.000
Not a sign of any kind of human emotion

20:59.000 --> 21:01.720
that normal people would have.

21:01.720 --> 21:06.720
What about the opposite of joy for teaching them a lesson?

21:08.040 --> 21:09.560
I don't think there's joy.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.920
I'm not sure Stalin really understood

21:12.920 --> 21:13.760
emotion of joy.

21:13.760 --> 21:15.120
What joy was, you know,

21:15.120 --> 21:20.120
I think he felt it was necessary to get those SOBs, right?

21:21.920 --> 21:23.680
That they deserved it.

21:23.680 --> 21:24.920
He says that several times.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.720
This is their own fault, right?

21:26.720 --> 21:27.880
This is their own fault.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.360
And as their own fault, you know,

21:32.360 --> 21:36.000
they get what they deserve basically.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.400
How much was the calculation?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.920
How much was it reason versus emotion?

21:41.240 --> 21:44.800
In terms of, you said he was competent.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.600
Was there a long-term strategy

21:47.600 --> 21:51.560
or was this strategy based on emotion and anger?

21:51.560 --> 21:56.440
No, I think actually the right answer is a little of both.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.280
I mean, usually the right answer in history

21:58.280 --> 21:59.120
is something like that.

21:59.120 --> 21:59.960
A little of both?

21:59.960 --> 22:01.400
No, you can't, you can't.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.640
It wasn't just, I mean, first of all, you know,

22:04.640 --> 22:09.640
the Soviets had it in for Ukraine and Ukrainian nationalism,

22:09.960 --> 22:12.080
which they really didn't like.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.680
And by the way, Russians still don't like it, right?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.080
So they had it in for Ukrainian nationalism.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.920
They feared Ukrainian nationalism.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.760
As I said, you know, Stalin writes, you know,

22:24.760 --> 22:29.440
we'll lose Ukraine, you know, if these guys win.

22:29.440 --> 22:33.320
You know, so there's a kind of long-term determination.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.280
As I said, you know, to kind of break the back

22:37.280 --> 22:42.280
of Ukrainian national identity and Ukrainian nationalism

22:43.160 --> 22:46.840
as any kind of separatist force whatsoever.

22:46.840 --> 22:50.040
And so there's that rational calculation.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.600
At the same time, I think Stalin is annoyed

22:53.560 --> 22:58.560
and peeved and angry on one level

22:59.560 --> 23:02.880
with the Ukrainians for resisting collectivization

23:02.880 --> 23:05.320
and for being difficult and for not, you know,

23:05.320 --> 23:10.320
not conforming, you know, to the way he thinks

23:11.000 --> 23:13.240
peasants should act in this situation.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.480
So you have both things.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.600
He's also very angry at the Ukrainian party

23:17.600 --> 23:20.160
and eventually purges it for not being able

23:20.160 --> 23:22.000
to control Ukraine and not be able

23:22.000 --> 23:23.920
to control the situation.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.440
You know, Ukraine is in theory the breadbasket, right,

23:26.440 --> 23:29.040
of Europe, well, how come the breadbasket

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
isn't turning over to me all this grain

23:31.040 --> 23:35.160
so I can sell it abroad and, you know, build new factories

23:35.160 --> 23:37.520
and support the workers in the cities.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.600
So there's a kind of annoyance.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.720
You know, when things fail,

23:41.720 --> 23:43.720
and this is absolutely typical of Stalin,

23:43.720 --> 23:45.920
when things fail, he blames it on other people

23:45.920 --> 23:47.720
and usually groups of people, right?

23:47.720 --> 23:49.960
Not individuals, but groups, again.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.680
So a little bit of both I think is the right answer.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.720
This blame, it feels like there's a playbook

23:57.720 --> 23:59.560
that dictators follow.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.400
I just wonder if it comes naturally

24:01.400 --> 24:03.040
or just kind of evolves,

24:04.000 --> 24:05.720
because, you know, blaming others

24:05.720 --> 24:07.000
and then telling these narratives

24:07.000 --> 24:08.360
and then creating the other

24:08.360 --> 24:10.720
and then somehow that leads to hatred and genocide.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.760
It feels like there's too many commonalities

24:14.760 --> 24:19.000
for it not to be a naturally emergent strategy

24:19.000 --> 24:20.720
that works for dictatorships.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.120
I mean, that's a good, it's a very good point.

24:23.120 --> 24:27.720
And I think it's one, you know, that has its merits.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.400
In other words, I think you're right

24:30.400 --> 24:33.000
that there's certain kinds of strategies by dictators

24:33.000 --> 24:35.520
that, you know, are common to them.

24:35.520 --> 24:36.960
A lot of them do killing,

24:36.960 --> 24:40.040
not all of them of that sort that Stalin did.

24:40.040 --> 24:42.840
I've written about Mao and Pol Pot and, you know,

24:42.840 --> 24:46.840
and Hitler and, you know, there is a sort of, as you say,

24:46.840 --> 24:51.800
a kind of playbook for political dictatorship,

24:51.800 --> 24:56.560
also for, you know, a kind of communist totalitarian way

24:57.320 --> 24:59.040
of functioning, you know,

24:59.040 --> 25:01.480
and that way of functioning was described already

25:01.480 --> 25:02.920
by Hannah Arendt early on

25:02.920 --> 25:05.360
when she wrote The Origins of Totalitarianism.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.240
And she more or less writes the playbook

25:10.240 --> 25:12.720
and Stalin does follow it.

25:12.720 --> 25:17.160
The real question, it seems to me, is to what extent,

25:17.160 --> 25:19.720
you know, and how deep does this go

25:19.720 --> 25:22.160
and how often does it go in that direction?

25:22.160 --> 25:25.000
I mean, you can argue, for example,

25:25.040 --> 25:27.520
I mean, Fidel Castro was not a nice man, right?

25:27.520 --> 25:29.880
He was a dictator, he was a terrible dictator,

25:30.960 --> 25:33.320
but he did not engage in mass murder.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.800
Ho Chi Minh was a dictator, a communist dictator

25:36.800 --> 25:39.840
who grew up, you know, in the communist movement,

25:39.840 --> 25:43.400
went to Moscow, you know, spent time in Moscow in the 30s

25:43.400 --> 25:47.760
and went to find, found the Vietnamese Communist Party.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.280
You know, he was a horrible dictator.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.480
I'm sure he was responsible

25:50.480 --> 25:52.600
for a lot of death and destruction,

25:52.600 --> 25:55.160
but he wasn't a mass murderer.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.920
And so you get those, you know.

25:57.920 --> 26:02.040
I mean, I would even argue, others will disagree,

26:02.040 --> 26:04.400
that Lenin wasn't a mass murderer, you know,

26:04.400 --> 26:07.000
that he didn't kill the same way, you know,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.440
that Stalin killed or people after him.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.320
They're communist dictators too, after all.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.600
Khrushchev was a communist dictator,

26:13.600 --> 26:14.960
but he stopped this killing.

26:16.360 --> 26:19.120
And, you know, he's still responsible for a gulag

26:19.120 --> 26:21.360
and people sent off into a gulag

26:21.400 --> 26:23.800
and imprisonment and torture and that sort of thing,

26:23.800 --> 26:25.400
but it's not at all the same thing.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.800
So there are some, you know, like Stalin, like Mao,

26:29.800 --> 26:32.680
like Pol Pot, you know, who commit these horrible,

26:32.680 --> 26:37.680
horrible atrocities, extensively engaging in my view

26:38.360 --> 26:41.240
in genocide, and there are some who don't.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.680
And, you know, what's the difference?

26:44.680 --> 26:47.680
Well, you know, the difference is partly in personality,

26:47.680 --> 26:50.400
partly in historical circumstance, you know,

26:50.440 --> 26:52.240
partly in, you know, who is it

26:52.240 --> 26:54.200
that controls the reins of power?

26:54.200 --> 26:57.040
How much do you connect the ideas of communism

26:57.040 --> 27:02.040
or Marxism or socialism to Holladamore, to Stalin's rule?

27:03.080 --> 27:05.640
So how naturally is he kind of alluded to,

27:05.640 --> 27:08.480
does it lead to genocide?

27:09.760 --> 27:13.200
That's also, I mean, in some ways,

27:13.200 --> 27:14.800
I've just addressed that question by saying

27:14.800 --> 27:17.440
it doesn't always lead to genocide, you know,

27:17.440 --> 27:21.000
in the case again, you know, Cuba is not pretty,

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
but it didn't have, there was no genocide in Cuba,

27:25.000 --> 27:26.600
and same thing in North Vietnam.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.720
You know, even North Korea, as awful as it is,

27:30.720 --> 27:32.480
is a terrible dictatorship, right?

27:32.480 --> 27:37.480
And people's rights are totally destroyed, right?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.880
They have no freedom whatsoever.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.560
You know, is not, as far as we know, genocidal.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.120
Who knows whether it could be

27:45.160 --> 27:47.480
or whether if they took over South Korea, you know,

27:47.480 --> 27:50.200
mass murder wouldn't take place and that kind of thing.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.280
But my point is, is that the ideology

27:53.280 --> 27:57.120
doesn't necessarily dictate genocide.

27:57.120 --> 27:59.680
In other words, it's an ideology, I think,

27:59.680 --> 28:04.280
that makes genocide sometimes too easily possible,

28:05.520 --> 28:09.200
given, you know, the way it thinks through history

28:09.200 --> 28:11.600
as being, you know, you're on the right side of history

28:11.600 --> 28:13.760
and some people are on the wrong side of history,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.680
and you have to destroy those people

28:15.680 --> 28:17.080
who are on the wrong side of history.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.800
I mean, there is something in, you know,

28:19.800 --> 28:22.520
Marxism, Leninism, which, you know,

28:22.520 --> 28:25.520
has that kind of language and that kind of thinking.

28:25.520 --> 28:30.520
But I don't think it's necessarily that way.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.160
There's a wonderful historian at Berkeley

28:34.160 --> 28:37.680
named Martin Malia, who has written, you know,

28:37.680 --> 28:39.640
wrote a number of books on this subject,

28:39.640 --> 28:42.640
and he was very, very, he was very,

28:42.640 --> 28:46.040
he was convinced that the, you know,

28:46.040 --> 28:49.720
that the ideology itself, you know,

28:49.720 --> 28:53.120
played a crucial role in the murderousness

28:53.120 --> 28:54.680
of the Soviet regime.

28:54.680 --> 28:57.120
I'm not completely convinced, you know,

28:57.120 --> 28:58.640
when I say not completely convinced,

28:58.640 --> 29:01.680
I think there are, you could argue at different ways,

29:01.680 --> 29:05.680
equally valid, you know, with equally valid arguments.

29:06.440 --> 29:11.400
There's something about the ideology of communism

29:11.400 --> 29:15.200
that allows you to decrease the value of human life,

29:15.200 --> 29:16.440
almost like this philosophy,

29:16.440 --> 29:19.680
if it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.040
So maybe that, if you can reason like that,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.240
then it's easier to take the leap of,

29:26.240 --> 29:28.440
for the good of the country, for the good of the people,

29:28.440 --> 29:31.640
for the good of the world, it's okay to kill a few people.

29:31.640 --> 29:36.640
And then that's where, I wonder about the slippery slope.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.640
Yeah, no, no, again, you know,

29:38.640 --> 29:40.240
I don't think it's a slippery slope.

29:40.240 --> 29:44.120
I think it's, I think it's dangerous.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.720
In other words, I think it's dangerous,

29:45.720 --> 29:48.680
but I don't consider, you know,

29:48.680 --> 29:50.920
I don't like Marxism, but I'm as many better

29:50.920 --> 29:52.600
than the next guy, and I've lived in plenty

29:52.600 --> 29:56.680
of those systems to know how they can beat people down

29:56.680 --> 30:01.680
and how they can, you know, destroy human aspirations

30:03.280 --> 30:06.520
and human interaction between people.

30:06.520 --> 30:11.520
But they're not necessarily murderous systems.

30:11.840 --> 30:15.640
They are systems that contain people's autonomy

30:15.640 --> 30:20.000
that force people into work and labor and lifestyles

30:20.000 --> 30:21.840
that they don't wanna live.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.680
I spent a lot of time, you know,

30:23.720 --> 30:27.640
with East Germans and Poles, you know,

30:27.640 --> 30:30.920
who lived in, and even in the Soviet Union,

30:32.160 --> 30:34.240
you know, when the post-Stalin period

30:34.240 --> 30:37.600
where people lived lives, they didn't wanna live, you know,

30:37.600 --> 30:40.680
and didn't have the freedom to choose.

30:40.680 --> 30:44.080
And that was terrifying in and of itself,

30:44.080 --> 30:46.680
but these were not murderous systems.

30:46.680 --> 30:51.520
And they, you know, ascribed to Marxism wellness.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.240
So I suppose it's important to draw the line

30:54.240 --> 30:58.520
between mass murder and genocide and mass murder

30:58.520 --> 31:02.760
versus just mass violation of human rights.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.080
Right, right.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.840
And the leap to mass murder, you're saying,

31:10.720 --> 31:13.280
may be easier in some ideologies than others,

31:13.280 --> 31:16.000
but it's not clear that somehow one ideology

31:16.000 --> 31:17.560
definitely leads to mass murder and not.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.400
Exactly.

31:18.400 --> 31:21.120
I wonder how many factors, what factors,

31:21.160 --> 31:24.040
how much of it is a single charismatic leader?

31:24.040 --> 31:28.040
How much of it is the conflagration

31:28.040 --> 31:30.680
of multiple historical events?

31:30.680 --> 31:35.120
How much of it is just dumb, the opposite of luck?

31:38.280 --> 31:41.680
Do you have a sense where if you look at a moment in history,

31:42.920 --> 31:46.840
predict, looking at the factors,

31:46.840 --> 31:49.560
well, there's something bad's going to happen here.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.360
When you look at Iraq,

31:51.360 --> 31:54.120
when Saddam Hussein first took power,

31:54.120 --> 31:57.120
well, you could, or you can, you know,

31:57.120 --> 31:58.720
go even farther back in history,

31:58.720 --> 32:00.280
would you be able to predict?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.120
So you said, you already kind of answered

32:02.120 --> 32:03.240
that with Stalin saying,

32:03.240 --> 32:05.560
there's no way you could have predicted that

32:05.560 --> 32:07.040
in the early twenties.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.040
Is that always the case?

32:08.040 --> 32:09.320
You basically can't predict.

32:09.320 --> 32:11.120
It's pretty much always the case.

32:11.120 --> 32:15.520
In other words, I mean, history is a wonderful, you know,

32:15.520 --> 32:18.720
discipline and way of looking at life and the world

32:18.720 --> 32:23.040
in retrospect, meaning it happened, it happened.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.000
And we know it happened.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.640
And it's too easy to say sometimes it happened

32:28.640 --> 32:30.720
because it had to happen that way.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.840
It almost never has to happen that way.

32:33.840 --> 32:38.560
And, you know, things, so I very much

32:40.760 --> 32:43.840
am of the school that emphasizes, you know,

32:43.840 --> 32:48.040
contingency and choice and difference

32:48.040 --> 32:50.480
and different paths and not, you know,

32:50.480 --> 32:54.960
not necessarily a path that has to be followed.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.920
And those, you know, and, you know,

32:59.920 --> 33:02.960
sometimes you can mourn about things.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.160
I mean, you can think, well, something's gonna happen.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.440
And usually the way it works,

33:08.440 --> 33:09.640
let me just give you one example.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.600
I mean, I'm thinking about an example right now,

33:11.600 --> 33:13.320
which was the war in Yugoslavia, you know,

33:13.320 --> 33:16.200
which came in the 1990s and eventually

33:16.200 --> 33:18.440
eventuated in genocide in Bosnia.

33:19.840 --> 33:22.960
And, you know, I remember very clearly,

33:22.960 --> 33:25.840
you know, the 1970s and 1980s in Yugoslavia

33:25.840 --> 33:28.280
and people would say, you know, there's trouble here

33:28.280 --> 33:31.280
and, you know, something could go wrong.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.920
But no one in their wildest imagination

33:33.920 --> 33:36.880
thought that there would be outright war between them.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.320
Then the outright war happened, genocide happened.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.960
And afterwards people would say, I saw it coming.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.680
You know, so you get a lot of that,

33:45.760 --> 33:49.200
especially with pundits and journalists and that's,

33:49.200 --> 33:51.080
I saw it coming, I knew it was happening.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.640
You know, well, I mean, what happens in the human mind

33:53.640 --> 33:55.680
and it happens in your mind too is, you know,

33:55.680 --> 33:58.200
you go through a lot of alternatives.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.480
I mean, think about January 6th, you know, in this country

34:00.480 --> 34:02.280
and all the different alternatives,

34:03.360 --> 34:08.360
which people had in their mind or before January 6th,

34:08.400 --> 34:10.720
you know, after the lost election, you know,

34:10.720 --> 34:13.200
things could have gone in lots of different ways.

34:13.200 --> 34:14.600
And there were all kinds of people

34:14.600 --> 34:16.360
choosing different ways it could have gone,

34:16.360 --> 34:20.040
but nobody really knew how it was going to turn out.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.040
Wasn't it smart people really understood

34:22.040 --> 34:25.440
that there'd be this Kakamemi uprising on January 6th,

34:25.440 --> 34:29.000
you know, that almost, you know, caused this enormous grief.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.680
So all of these kinds of things in history,

34:31.680 --> 34:33.680
you know, are deeply contingent.

34:33.680 --> 34:37.360
They depend on, you know, factors that we cannot predict.

34:37.360 --> 34:41.440
And, you know, and it's the joy of history that it's open.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.560
You know, you think about how people are now,

34:43.560 --> 34:45.080
I mean, let me give you one more example

34:45.080 --> 34:46.720
and then I'll shut up.

34:46.720 --> 34:49.720
But, you know, there's the environmental example.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.040
You know, we're all threatened, right?

34:51.040 --> 34:52.000
We know it's coming.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.480
We know there's trouble, right?

34:54.480 --> 34:58.280
We know there's going to be a catastrophe at some point,

34:58.280 --> 34:59.320
but when?

34:59.320 --> 35:01.000
What's the catastrophe?

35:01.000 --> 35:02.440
Yeah, what's the nature of the catastrophe?

35:02.440 --> 35:03.280
Everyone says catastrophe.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.120
And what's the nature of it?

35:04.120 --> 35:04.940
Right, right, right.

35:04.940 --> 35:05.780
Is it going to be wars

35:05.780 --> 35:06.620
or is it going to be forced constraints?

35:06.620 --> 35:07.460
Is it going to be hunger?

35:07.460 --> 35:10.780
Is it going to be like mass migration of different kinds

35:10.780 --> 35:13.260
that leads to some kind of conflict and immigration?

35:13.260 --> 35:16.300
And maybe it won't be that big of a deal

35:16.300 --> 35:19.020
and a total other catastrophic event

35:19.020 --> 35:22.220
will completely challenge the entirety of the human civilization.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.380
That's my point.

35:23.380 --> 35:24.260
That's my point.

35:24.260 --> 35:25.980
That's my point.

35:25.980 --> 35:28.100
You know, we really don't know.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.740
I mean, there's a lot we do know.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.060
I mean, the warming business and all this kind of stuff,

35:32.060 --> 35:34.260
you know, it's scientifically there,

35:34.260 --> 35:36.540
but how it's going to play out.

35:36.540 --> 35:39.660
And everybody's saying, you know, different things.

35:39.660 --> 35:42.980
And then you get somewhere in 50 years or 60 years,

35:42.980 --> 35:45.500
which I won't see, and people say, aha,

35:45.500 --> 35:47.900
I told you it was going to be X or it was going to be Y

35:47.900 --> 35:49.380
or it was going to be Z.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.100
So I just don't think in history you can,

35:54.580 --> 35:56.340
well, you can't predict.

35:56.340 --> 35:59.020
You simply cannot predict what's going to happen.

35:59.020 --> 36:03.140
It's kind of when you just look at Hitler in the 30s for me,

36:03.180 --> 36:07.140
oftentimes when I kind of read different accounts,

36:07.140 --> 36:09.100
it is so often, certainly in the press,

36:09.100 --> 36:11.900
but in general, me just reading about Hitler,

36:11.900 --> 36:15.020
I get the sense like, this is a clown.

36:15.020 --> 36:18.420
There's no way this person will gain power.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.260
Which one?

36:19.260 --> 36:20.220
Hitler or Stalin?

36:20.220 --> 36:21.420
Hitler, Hitler.

36:21.420 --> 36:24.260
No, no, no, with Stalin, you don't get a sense he's a clown.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.060
He's a really good executive.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.540
You think, you don't think it would lead to mass murder,

36:28.580 --> 36:32.460
but you think he's going to build a giant bureaucracy,

36:32.460 --> 36:34.700
at least with Hitler, it's like,

36:36.020 --> 36:39.540
like a failed artist who keeps screaming about stuff.

36:39.540 --> 36:41.940
There's no way he's gonna,

36:41.940 --> 36:44.820
I mean, you certainly don't think about the atrocities,

36:44.820 --> 36:47.620
but there's no way he's going to gain power,

36:47.620 --> 36:48.940
especially against communists.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.660
There's so many other competing forces

36:50.660 --> 36:53.460
that could have easily beat him.

36:53.460 --> 36:57.540
So, but then you realize like,

36:57.540 --> 37:00.420
event after event where this clown keeps dancing

37:00.420 --> 37:02.380
and all of a sudden he gains more and more power

37:02.380 --> 37:04.980
and just certain moments in time,

37:04.980 --> 37:09.980
he makes strategic decisions in terms of cooperating

37:11.540 --> 37:13.220
or gaining power over the military,

37:13.220 --> 37:14.540
all those kinds of things,

37:15.740 --> 37:17.340
that event should give him the power.

37:17.340 --> 37:21.540
I mean, this clown is one of the most impactful

37:21.540 --> 37:25.300
in the negative sense, human beings in history.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.140
And even the Jews who are there and are being screamed at

37:29.140 --> 37:31.860
and discriminated against and who's,

37:31.860 --> 37:34.580
there's series of measures taken against them incrementally

37:34.580 --> 37:39.420
during the course of the 1930s, very few who leave.

37:39.420 --> 37:40.740
I mean, some pick up and go and say,

37:40.740 --> 37:42.340
I'm getting the hell out of here,

37:42.340 --> 37:45.380
and some Zionists try to leave too

37:45.380 --> 37:46.820
and go to the United States and stuff,

37:46.820 --> 37:51.620
but go to Israel and Palestine at the time,

37:51.620 --> 37:56.620
but, or to Britain or France, but in general,

37:57.180 --> 37:59.980
even the Jews who should have been very sensitive

37:59.980 --> 38:03.460
to what was going on, didn't really understand

38:03.460 --> 38:06.100
the extent of the danger.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.740
And it's really hard for people to do that.

38:08.740 --> 38:12.060
It's almost impossible, in fact, I think.

38:12.060 --> 38:15.060
So most of the time in that exact situation,

38:16.860 --> 38:18.340
nothing would have happened

38:18.340 --> 38:20.220
or there'd be some drama and so on,

38:20.380 --> 38:22.220
be there's some bureaucrat,

38:22.220 --> 38:23.860
but every once in a while in human history,

38:23.860 --> 38:25.900
there's a kind of turn.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.740
There may be something catalyzes something else

38:28.740 --> 38:32.980
and just it accelerates, it accelerates, escalates, escalates,

38:32.980 --> 38:35.060
and then war breaks out or totally,

38:36.340 --> 38:37.820
revolutions break out.

38:37.820 --> 38:38.660
Right.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.580
Can we go to the big question of genocide?

38:43.580 --> 38:44.860
What is genocide?

38:44.860 --> 38:47.460
What are the defining characteristics of genocide?

38:48.420 --> 38:50.620
Dealing with genocide is a difficult thing

38:50.620 --> 38:52.380
when it comes to the definition.

38:53.580 --> 38:58.580
There is a definition, the December 1948 UN convention

38:58.580 --> 39:02.260
on the prevention and punishment of genocide

39:02.260 --> 39:07.260
is considered the sort of major document of definition

39:07.620 --> 39:09.740
in the definitional sense of genocide.

39:09.740 --> 39:14.740
And it emphasizes the intentional destruction

39:15.260 --> 39:20.260
of an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group.

39:22.100 --> 39:26.660
Those are the four groups again, comma as such.

39:26.660 --> 39:29.780
And what that means basically is destroying

39:29.780 --> 39:31.900
the group as a group.

39:31.900 --> 39:36.700
In other words, there's a kind of beauty in human diversity

39:36.700 --> 39:39.540
and different groups of people,

39:39.540 --> 39:44.540
Estonians, tribe of Native Americans, South African,

39:44.780 --> 39:48.900
tribes, the Rohingya in Myanmar.

39:48.900 --> 39:52.180
There's a kind of beauty humanity recognizes

39:52.180 --> 39:54.580
in the distinctiveness of those groups.

39:55.620 --> 39:59.580
This was a notion that emerges really with romanticism

39:59.580 --> 40:00.940
after the French Revolution

40:00.940 --> 40:04.500
in the beginning of the 19th century with herder mostly.

40:04.500 --> 40:06.900
And this beauty of these groups then

40:08.900 --> 40:12.540
is what is under attack in genocide.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.100
And it's with intent.

40:16.100 --> 40:19.820
The idea is that it's intentional destruction.

40:19.820 --> 40:24.820
So this is a kind of analogy to first degree,

40:25.300 --> 40:27.100
second degree, and third degree murder, right?

40:27.100 --> 40:30.140
First degree murder, you're out to kill this person

40:30.140 --> 40:34.180
and you plan it and you go out and you do it, right?

40:34.180 --> 40:36.100
That's intent, right?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.780
Manslaughter is not intent.

40:37.780 --> 40:40.980
You end up doing the same thing, but it's different.

40:41.020 --> 40:46.020
So the major person behind the definition

40:46.620 --> 40:48.100
is a man named Raphael Lemkin.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.420
I don't know if you heard his name or not,

40:50.420 --> 40:53.580
but he was a Polish Jewish jurist

40:53.580 --> 40:57.100
who came from Poland, came to the United States

40:57.100 --> 41:01.100
during the war and had been a kind of crusader

41:03.380 --> 41:05.820
for recognizing genocide.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.660
It's a word that he created by the way.

41:09.220 --> 41:13.220
He coined the term in 1943 and then published it in 1944

41:13.220 --> 41:14.940
for the first time.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.100
Geno meaning people and side meaning killing, right?

41:18.100 --> 41:20.940
And so Lemkin then had this term

41:20.940 --> 41:23.420
and he pushed hard to have it recognized

41:23.420 --> 41:24.980
and it was in the UN convention.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.380
So that's the rough definition.

41:27.380 --> 41:30.540
The problem with the definition,

41:30.540 --> 41:33.060
the problems with the definition are several.

41:33.940 --> 41:38.460
You know, one of them is, is it just these four groups?

41:38.460 --> 41:42.340
You know, racial, religious, ethnic or national.

41:42.340 --> 41:44.620
See, this comes right out of the war.

41:44.620 --> 41:49.500
And what's in people's minds in 1948 are Jews, Poles,

41:49.500 --> 41:53.060
Russians, Yugoslavs sometimes who were killed by the Nazis.

41:53.060 --> 41:54.580
That's what's in their mind.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.980
But there are other groups too, if you think about it,

41:56.980 --> 42:01.380
you know, who are killed, social groups or political groups.

42:01.420 --> 42:05.260
And that was not allowed in the convention,

42:05.260 --> 42:07.940
meaning for a lot of different reasons,

42:07.940 --> 42:10.780
the Soviets were primary among them.

42:10.780 --> 42:12.900
They didn't want other kinds of groups,

42:12.900 --> 42:16.660
let's say Kulaks for example, to be considered.

42:16.660 --> 42:21.540
That's a social group or peasants, which is a social group.

42:21.540 --> 42:23.180
So, or a political group.

42:23.180 --> 42:26.620
I mean, let's take a group, you know,

42:26.620 --> 42:30.380
communists killed groups of people,

42:30.380 --> 42:32.580
but non-communists also killed groups of people.

42:32.580 --> 42:36.460
In Indonesia in 1965, 66, they killed, you know,

42:36.460 --> 42:40.140
no exactly, but roughly 600,000 Indonesian communists.

42:40.140 --> 42:42.540
Well, is that genocide or not?

42:42.540 --> 42:45.300
You know, and my point of view, it is genocide,

42:45.300 --> 42:48.460
although it's Indonesians killing Indonesians.

42:48.460 --> 42:51.100
And we have the same problem with the Cambodian genocide.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.900
I mean, we talk about a Cambodian genocide,

42:53.900 --> 42:56.980
but most of the people killed in the Cambodian genocide

42:56.980 --> 42:58.660
were other Cambodians.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.700
They give it the name,

42:59.700 --> 43:02.100
they're ready to recognize this genocide

43:02.100 --> 43:04.380
because they also killed some other peoples,

43:04.380 --> 43:08.100
meaning the Vietnamese, Aham people who are,

43:08.100 --> 43:13.100
you know, Muslim, smaller Muslim people in the area

43:13.340 --> 43:14.740
and a few others.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.500
So the question then becomes,

43:17.500 --> 43:20.340
well, does it have to be a different nationality

43:20.340 --> 43:23.140
or ethnic group or religious group for it to be genocide?

43:23.140 --> 43:24.780
And my answer is no.

43:24.780 --> 43:26.460
You know, you need to expand the definition.

43:26.460 --> 43:28.100
It's a little bit like with our constitution.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.900
We got a constitution,

43:29.900 --> 43:32.020
but we don't live in the end of the 18th century, right?

43:32.020 --> 43:33.620
We live in the 21st century.

43:33.620 --> 43:36.620
And so you have to update the constitution

43:36.620 --> 43:38.300
over the centuries.

43:38.300 --> 43:42.660
And similarly, the genocide convention needs updating too.

43:42.660 --> 43:45.100
So that's how I work with the definition.

43:45.100 --> 43:48.020
So this is this invention.

43:48.020 --> 43:49.380
Was it an invention?

43:49.380 --> 43:52.020
This beautiful idea, romantic idea

43:52.020 --> 43:53.540
that there's groups of people

43:53.540 --> 43:57.660
and the group is united by some unique characteristics.

43:57.660 --> 44:01.620
That was an invention in human history, this idea,

44:01.620 --> 44:03.460
not to see us as individuals.

44:03.460 --> 44:05.180
Yes, in some senses it was.

44:05.180 --> 44:06.740
I mean, it's not, you know,

44:06.740 --> 44:09.340
there are things that are always constructed

44:09.340 --> 44:10.660
in one fashion or another.

44:10.660 --> 44:13.220
And the construction, you know,

44:13.220 --> 44:15.860
more or less represents the reality.

44:15.860 --> 44:18.540
And what the reality is always much more complicated

44:18.540 --> 44:21.940
than the construction or the invention of a term

44:21.940 --> 44:26.420
or a concept or a way of thinking about a nation, right?

44:26.420 --> 44:29.740
And this way of thinking of nations, you know,

44:29.740 --> 44:34.740
as again, you know, groups of religious, linguistic,

44:37.980 --> 44:42.300
not political necessarily, but cultural entities

44:42.300 --> 44:45.500
is something that was essentially invented, yes.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.460
Yes, I mean, you know, if you look at-

44:47.460 --> 44:50.380
There are no Germans in the 17th century.

44:50.380 --> 44:52.740
There are no Italians in the 17th century, right?

44:52.740 --> 44:54.860
They're only there after, you know,

44:54.860 --> 44:59.380
the invention of the nation, which comes again,

44:59.380 --> 45:01.900
mostly as out of the French Revolution

45:01.900 --> 45:03.700
and in the Romantic movement,

45:03.700 --> 45:08.420
a man named Johann Gottfried von Herder, right?

45:08.420 --> 45:11.420
Who was really the first one who sort of went around,

45:11.420 --> 45:14.700
collected people's languages and collected their sayings

45:14.700 --> 45:17.820
and their dances and their folk ways and stuff and said,

45:17.820 --> 45:20.660
isn't this cool, you know, that they're Estonians

45:20.660 --> 45:21.780
and that they're Latvians

45:21.780 --> 45:23.140
and that they're these other,

45:23.140 --> 45:25.900
these interesting different peoples

45:25.900 --> 45:28.420
who don't even know necessarily

45:28.420 --> 45:30.620
that they're different peoples, right?

45:30.620 --> 45:33.140
That comes a little bit later, right?

45:33.140 --> 45:35.020
Once the concept is invented,

45:35.020 --> 45:39.020
then people start to say, hey, we're nations too, you know?

45:39.020 --> 45:41.820
And the Germans decide they're a nation and they unify

45:41.820 --> 45:43.900
and the Italians discover they're a nation

45:43.900 --> 45:46.260
and they unify instead of being, you know,

45:46.260 --> 45:51.100
Florentines and Romans and, you know, Sicilians.

45:52.100 --> 45:55.340
But then beyond nations, there's political affiliations,

45:55.340 --> 45:56.180
all those kinds of things.

45:56.180 --> 45:59.500
It's fascinating that, you know, you start,

45:59.500 --> 46:01.580
look at the early Homo sapiens

46:01.580 --> 46:04.220
and then there's obviously tribes, right?

46:04.220 --> 46:06.660
And then that's very concrete,

46:06.660 --> 46:10.700
that's a geographic location and it's a small group of people

46:10.700 --> 46:12.940
and you have warring tribes probably connected

46:12.940 --> 46:16.140
to just limited resources.

46:16.140 --> 46:17.260
But it's fascinating to think that

46:17.260 --> 46:20.780
that is then taken to the space of ideas

46:20.820 --> 46:23.420
to where you can create a group at first

46:23.420 --> 46:27.020
to appreciate its beauty.

46:27.020 --> 46:30.020
You create a group based on language,

46:30.020 --> 46:34.340
based on maybe even some political philosophical ideas,

46:34.340 --> 46:36.380
religious ideas, all those kinds of things.

46:36.380 --> 46:38.580
And then that naturally then leads

46:38.580 --> 46:42.860
to getting angry at groups and making them the other

46:42.860 --> 46:43.940
and then hatred.

46:43.940 --> 46:47.660
Right, that comes more towards the end of the 19th century,

46:47.660 --> 46:50.100
you know, with the influence of Darwin.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.980
I mean, you can't blame Darwin for it,

46:51.980 --> 46:54.340
but neo-Darwin, Darwinians, you know,

46:54.340 --> 46:55.900
who start to talk about, you know,

46:55.900 --> 46:59.380
the competition between nations, the natural competition,

46:59.380 --> 47:03.260
the weak ones fall away, the strong ones get ahead.

47:03.260 --> 47:06.860
You know, you get this sort of combination also with,

47:06.860 --> 47:09.820
you know, modern antisemitism and with racial thinking.

47:09.820 --> 47:12.460
You know, the racial thinking at the end of the 19th century

47:12.460 --> 47:14.100
is very powerful.

47:14.100 --> 47:17.020
So now, you know, at the end of the 19th century

47:17.020 --> 47:19.540
versus the beginning of the 19th century,

47:19.540 --> 47:22.340
you know, the middle of the 19th century,

47:22.340 --> 47:24.060
you know, you can be a German and be a Jew

47:24.060 --> 47:26.260
and there's no contradiction.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.100
Yeah.

47:27.100 --> 47:28.900
As long as you speak the language and you, you know,

47:28.900 --> 47:32.460
you dress and think and act and share the culture.

47:32.460 --> 47:34.180
By the end of the 19th century, people are saying,

47:34.180 --> 47:37.140
no, no, you know, they're not Germans.

47:37.140 --> 47:37.980
They're Jews, they're different.

47:37.980 --> 47:39.300
They have different blood, they have different,

47:39.300 --> 47:41.260
they don't say genes yet, but you know,

47:41.260 --> 47:43.780
that's sort of a sense of people.

47:43.780 --> 47:45.460
And that's when, you know,

47:45.460 --> 47:49.260
there's this sense of superiority too and inferiority.

47:49.780 --> 47:51.740
You know, that they're inferior to us.

47:51.740 --> 47:52.580
Yeah.

47:52.580 --> 47:55.420
You know, and that we're the strong ones

47:55.420 --> 47:57.500
and we have to, you know, and Hitler, by the way,

47:57.500 --> 48:00.300
just adopts this hook line and sinker.

48:00.300 --> 48:03.060
I mean, they're a whole series of thinkers

48:03.060 --> 48:05.140
at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th century

48:05.140 --> 48:06.940
who he cites in Mein Kampf, you know,

48:06.940 --> 48:09.340
which is written in the early 1920s

48:09.340 --> 48:14.340
that, you know, basically pervades this racial thinking.

48:15.180 --> 48:16.820
So nationalism changes.

48:16.820 --> 48:19.900
So nationalism in and of itself is not bad.

48:19.900 --> 48:21.260
I mean, it's not bad, you know,

48:21.260 --> 48:25.260
to share culture and language and, you know,

48:25.260 --> 48:29.980
folkways and sense of common belonging

48:29.980 --> 48:32.820
and nothing bad about it inherently.

48:32.820 --> 48:35.580
But then what happens is it becomes, you know,

48:35.580 --> 48:37.500
frequently is used and becomes,

48:37.500 --> 48:42.420
especially on fascism, becomes dangerous.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.620
And it's especially dangerous

48:44.620 --> 48:49.020
when the two conflicting groups share geographic location.

48:49.020 --> 48:49.860
That's right.

48:49.860 --> 48:54.300
So like with Jews, you know, I come, you know,

48:54.300 --> 48:58.820
I'm a Russian Jew and it's always interesting.

48:58.820 --> 49:03.420
I take pride in, you know,

49:03.420 --> 49:07.500
I love the tradition of the Soviet Union, of Russia.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.540
I love America.

49:08.540 --> 49:10.220
So I love these countries.

49:10.220 --> 49:12.780
They have a beautiful tradition and in literature

49:12.780 --> 49:15.380
and science and art and all those kinds of things.

49:15.380 --> 49:19.300
But it's funny that people, not often,

49:19.300 --> 49:24.060
but sometimes correct me that I'm not Russian.

49:24.060 --> 49:24.900
I'm a Jew.

49:26.620 --> 49:30.060
And it's a nice reminder.

49:30.060 --> 49:31.060
Yes.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.300
That that is always there,

49:34.300 --> 49:37.340
that desire to create these groups.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.860
And then when they're living in the same place

49:39.900 --> 49:42.180
for that division between groups,

49:42.180 --> 49:45.100
that hate between groups can explode.

49:46.020 --> 49:49.620
And I just, I wonder why is that there?

49:49.620 --> 49:53.500
Why does the human heart tend so easily

49:53.500 --> 49:55.620
towards this kind of hate?

49:58.500 --> 50:02.700
You know, that's a big question in and of itself.

50:02.700 --> 50:04.900
You know, the human heart is full of everything, right?

50:04.900 --> 50:05.820
It's full of hate.

50:05.820 --> 50:06.740
It's full of love.

50:06.740 --> 50:07.940
It's full of indifference.

50:07.940 --> 50:09.820
It's full of apathy.

50:09.820 --> 50:10.780
It's full of energy.

50:10.780 --> 50:15.060
So, I mean, hate is something, you know, that,

50:17.780 --> 50:22.780
I mean, I think, and, you know, along with hate,

50:23.540 --> 50:26.340
you know, the ability to really hurt and injure people

50:26.340 --> 50:28.340
is something that's within all of us.

50:28.340 --> 50:30.420
You know, it's within all of us.

50:30.420 --> 50:33.500
And it's just something that's part of who we are

50:35.220 --> 50:37.940
and part of our society.

50:37.940 --> 50:40.060
So, you know, we're shaped by our society

50:40.060 --> 50:43.460
and our society can do with us often what it wishes.

50:44.820 --> 50:46.860
You know, that's why it's so much nicer to live

50:46.860 --> 50:49.860
in a more or less beneficent society

50:49.860 --> 50:52.580
like that of a democracy in the West

50:52.580 --> 50:55.180
than to live in the Soviet Union, right?

50:55.180 --> 50:59.100
I mean, because, you know, you have more or less

50:59.100 --> 51:01.860
the freedom to do what you wish

51:01.860 --> 51:04.500
and not to be forced into situations

51:04.500 --> 51:08.700
in which you would have to then do nasty to other people.

51:09.940 --> 51:12.860
Some societies, as we talked about, you know,

51:12.860 --> 51:17.060
are more have proclivities towards, you know,

51:17.060 --> 51:21.180
asking of its people to do things they don't wanna do

51:21.180 --> 51:24.460
and forcing them to do so.

51:24.460 --> 51:27.900
So, you know, freedom is a wonderful thing.

51:27.900 --> 51:30.940
To be able to choose not to do evil is a great thing,

51:30.940 --> 51:33.980
you know, whereas in some societies, you know,

51:33.980 --> 51:38.980
you feel in some ways for not so much for the NKVD bosses,

51:39.140 --> 51:42.020
but for the guys on the ground, you know, in the 1930s,

51:42.020 --> 51:44.900
or not so much for the Nazi bosses,

51:44.900 --> 51:49.180
but for the guys, you know, in the police battalion

51:50.420 --> 51:53.820
that were told, go shoot those Jews, you know,

51:53.820 --> 51:57.300
and you do it not necessarily

51:57.300 --> 51:59.740
because they force you to do it,

51:59.740 --> 52:04.140
but because your social, you know, your social situation,

52:06.300 --> 52:07.660
you know, encourages you to,

52:07.660 --> 52:10.020
and you don't have the courage not to.

52:10.020 --> 52:12.620
Yeah, I was just, as I often do,

52:12.620 --> 52:15.980
rereading Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning,

52:15.980 --> 52:19.140
and he said something that just,

52:19.140 --> 52:21.300
I often pull out sort of lines.

52:22.460 --> 52:25.220
The mere knowledge that a man was either a camp guard

52:25.220 --> 52:28.380
or a prisoner tells us almost nothing.

52:28.380 --> 52:31.220
Human kindness can be found in all groups,

52:31.220 --> 52:36.220
even those which as a whole, it would be easy to condemn.

52:36.260 --> 52:41.260
So that's speaking to you feel for those people

52:41.660 --> 52:45.860
at the lowest level implementing the orders

52:48.540 --> 52:49.820
of those above.

52:49.820 --> 52:50.660
Right.

52:51.780 --> 52:54.740
And also you worry yourself what will happen

52:54.740 --> 52:56.820
if you were given those same orders, you know,

52:56.820 --> 52:59.060
I mean, what would you do?

52:59.060 --> 53:01.740
You know, what kind of reaction would you have

53:01.740 --> 53:03.420
in this similar situation?

53:03.420 --> 53:05.900
And, you know, you don't know.

53:07.780 --> 53:10.660
I could see myself in World War II

53:10.660 --> 53:15.660
fighting for almost any country that I was born in.

53:17.180 --> 53:18.820
There's a love of community,

53:18.820 --> 53:21.020
there's a love of country that's just,

53:21.900 --> 53:23.220
at least to me it comes naturally,

53:23.220 --> 53:25.260
just love of community,

53:25.260 --> 53:27.300
and countries want such community.

53:27.300 --> 53:29.500
And I could see fighting for that country,

53:29.500 --> 53:32.340
especially when you're sold a story

53:32.340 --> 53:33.700
that you're fighting evil,

53:33.700 --> 53:35.340
and I'm sure every single country

53:35.340 --> 53:38.580
would have sold that story effectively.

53:38.580 --> 53:41.300
And then when you're in the military

53:41.300 --> 53:42.420
and you have a gun in your hand

53:42.420 --> 53:47.420
or you're in the police force and you're ordered,

53:47.660 --> 53:52.660
go to this place and commit violence,

53:53.060 --> 53:55.380
it's hard to know what you would do.

53:55.380 --> 53:57.500
It's a mix of fear, it's a mix of,

53:58.980 --> 54:00.980
maybe you convince yourself, you know,

54:00.980 --> 54:03.500
what can one person really do?

54:03.500 --> 54:05.780
And over time it's again that slippery slope.

54:06.900 --> 54:09.020
Because you could see all the people who protest,

54:09.020 --> 54:12.580
who revolt, they're ineffective.

54:13.900 --> 54:17.460
So like, if you actually want to practically help somehow,

54:17.460 --> 54:19.300
you're going to convince yourself that you can't,

54:19.300 --> 54:21.060
one person can't possibly help.

54:21.180 --> 54:22.180
Right.

54:22.180 --> 54:23.220
And then you have a family,

54:23.220 --> 54:25.700
so you want to protect your family.

54:25.700 --> 54:28.700
You tell all of these stories and over time,

54:28.700 --> 54:32.580
it, you naturally convince yourself to dehumanize the other.

54:33.460 --> 54:35.260
Yeah, I think about this a lot,

54:38.660 --> 54:41.540
mostly because I worry that I would be a good German.

54:42.420 --> 54:44.620
Yeah, no, no, that's right, that's right.

54:44.620 --> 54:49.620
And one of my tasks as a teacher, right, our students,

54:51.340 --> 54:54.460
and I have classes on genocide, I have one now,

54:55.940 --> 54:57.900
and another one, by the way, on Stalin.

54:58.940 --> 55:03.940
But the one on genocide, one of my tasks is to try to,

55:03.980 --> 55:05.860
try to get the students to understand

55:05.860 --> 55:09.140
this is not about weird people who live far away

55:09.140 --> 55:12.660
in time and in place, but it's about them.

55:12.660 --> 55:17.140
And that's a hard lesson, but it's an important one,

55:17.140 --> 55:20.580
that this is in all of us, it's in all of us.

55:20.580 --> 55:22.820
And there's nothing, you know,

55:22.820 --> 55:25.620
and you just try to gird yourself up, you know,

55:25.620 --> 55:29.380
to try to figure out ways that maybe you won't be complicit

55:30.860 --> 55:33.620
and that you learn how to stand by your principles,

55:33.620 --> 55:36.180
but it's very hard, it's extremely difficult.

55:36.180 --> 55:38.700
And you can't, the other interesting thing about it

55:38.700 --> 55:40.380
is it's not predictable.

55:40.380 --> 55:42.700
You know, as they've done a lot of studies of Poles,

55:42.700 --> 55:45.860
for example, who during the war saved Jews, you know,

55:45.860 --> 55:47.820
well, who are the Poles who saved Jews

55:47.820 --> 55:50.100
versus those who turned them in?

55:50.100 --> 55:51.820
It's completely unpredictable.

55:51.820 --> 55:53.860
You know, sometimes it's the worst antisemites

55:53.860 --> 55:55.460
who protect them because they don't believe

55:55.460 --> 55:57.580
they should be killed, right?

55:58.860 --> 56:01.220
And sometimes, you know, it's not predictable.

56:01.220 --> 56:04.300
It's not as if the humanists among us, you know,

56:04.300 --> 56:09.020
are the ones who, you know, can consistently show up,

56:09.020 --> 56:14.020
you know, and experience danger, in other words,

56:14.020 --> 56:17.860
and are ready to take on danger to defend, you know,

56:17.860 --> 56:19.820
your fellow human beings, not necessarily.

56:19.820 --> 56:21.580
I mean, sometimes simple people do it,

56:21.580 --> 56:24.820
and sometimes they do it for really simple reasons.

56:24.820 --> 56:28.500
And sometimes people you would expect to do it don't,

56:29.420 --> 56:31.060
you know, and you've got that mix

56:31.060 --> 56:32.540
and it's just not predictable.

56:33.540 --> 56:37.260
One thing I've learned in this age of social media

56:37.260 --> 56:39.820
is it feels like the people with integrity

56:39.820 --> 56:41.900
and the ones who would do the right thing

56:41.900 --> 56:43.220
are the quiet ones.

56:44.660 --> 56:46.860
In terms of humanists, in terms of activists,

56:46.860 --> 56:49.100
there's so many points to be gained.

56:50.340 --> 56:52.700
Of declaring that you would do the right thing.

56:54.300 --> 56:57.500
It's the simple, quiet folks.

56:58.780 --> 57:01.340
Because I've seen quite, on a small,

57:01.340 --> 57:03.500
obviously much smaller scale,

57:03.500 --> 57:05.900
just shows of integrity and character

57:05.900 --> 57:07.380
when there was sacrifice to be made

57:07.380 --> 57:08.620
and it was done quietly.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.620
This sort of the small heroes.

57:12.620 --> 57:15.620
Those are, you're right, it's surprising,

57:15.620 --> 57:17.260
but they're often quiet.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.940
That's why I'm distrustful of people

57:18.940 --> 57:21.380
who kind of proclaim that they would do the right thing.

57:21.380 --> 57:23.580
Right, right, right.

57:23.580 --> 57:25.500
And there are different kinds of integrity too.

57:25.500 --> 57:30.500
I mean, I edited a memoir of a Polish underground fighter,

57:34.980 --> 57:37.220
member of the underground who was in Majdanek

57:37.220 --> 57:38.900
in the concentration camp in Majdanek.

57:38.900 --> 57:41.220
You know, and it was just an interesting mix

57:41.220 --> 57:43.540
of different kinds of integrity.

57:43.540 --> 57:45.180
You know, on the one hand,

57:45.980 --> 57:50.340
you know, it really bothered him deeply

57:50.340 --> 57:53.580
when Jews were killed or sent to camp or that sort of thing.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.780
On the other hand, he was something of an anti-Semite.

57:56.780 --> 57:59.660
You know, and he would, you know,

57:59.660 --> 58:02.780
sometimes if Jews were his friends, he would help them.

58:02.780 --> 58:06.340
And if they weren't, sometimes he was really mean to them.

58:06.340 --> 58:08.180
You know, and you could, in their various levels,

58:08.180 --> 58:11.420
you know, a concentration camp is, you know,

58:11.460 --> 58:15.540
a terrible social experiment in some ways, right?

58:17.660 --> 58:19.940
But you learn a lot from how people behave.

58:19.940 --> 58:21.300
And what you see is that, you know,

58:21.300 --> 58:23.980
people behave sometimes extraordinarily well

58:23.980 --> 58:26.660
in some situations and extraordinarily poorly in others.

58:26.660 --> 58:28.740
And it's mixed and you can't predict it.

58:28.740 --> 58:32.380
And it's hard to find consistency.

58:32.380 --> 58:33.500
I mean, that's the other thing.

58:33.500 --> 58:37.180
It's, you know, I think we claim too much consistency

58:37.180 --> 58:38.460
for the people we study

58:38.460 --> 58:40.380
and the people we think about in the past.

58:40.380 --> 58:41.660
You know, they're not consistent.

58:41.660 --> 58:43.660
Any more than we are consistent, right?

58:45.140 --> 58:48.020
Well, let me ask you about human nature here on both sides.

58:48.020 --> 58:53.020
So first, what have you learned about human nature

58:53.100 --> 58:54.700
for studying genocide?

58:54.700 --> 58:56.820
Why do humans commit genocide?

58:56.820 --> 59:01.540
What lessons, first of all, why is a difficult question,

59:01.540 --> 59:04.820
but what insights do you have into humans

59:04.820 --> 59:07.820
that genocide is something that happens in the world?

59:07.820 --> 59:10.340
That's a really big and difficult question, right?

59:11.340 --> 59:13.940
And it has to be parsed, I think,

59:13.940 --> 59:16.420
into different kinds of questions.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.820
You know, why does genocide happen?

59:19.660 --> 59:24.420
You know, which the answer there is frequently political,

59:24.420 --> 59:28.980
meaning, you know, why Hitler ended up killing the Jews?

59:28.980 --> 59:32.060
Well, it had a lot to do with the political history

59:32.060 --> 59:35.420
of Germany and wartime history of Germany, right?

59:36.420 --> 59:40.460
In the 30s, and, you know, it's traceable to then.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.940
No, like you mentioned it yourself.

59:42.940 --> 59:45.980
You can't imagine Hitler in the mid-20s

59:45.980 --> 59:49.540
turning into anything of the kind of dictator

59:49.540 --> 59:53.860
he ended up being and the kind of mass murderer

59:53.860 --> 59:55.500
he ended up being.

59:55.500 --> 59:58.820
So, and the same thing goes, by the way,

59:58.820 --> 01:00:01.220
for Stalin and Soviet Union and Pol Pot.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:04.780
I mean, these are all essentially political movements

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.100
where the polity state is seized, you know,

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:13.100
by ideological or, you know, party, single party movement

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.740
and then is moved in directions

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.460
where mass killing takes place.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.380
The other question, you know,

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.580
let's separate that question out.

01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.740
The other question is why do ordinary people participate?

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:31.020
Because the fact of the matter is,

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.740
just ordering genocide is not enough.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.620
Just saying, you know, go get them is not enough.

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.100
There have to be people who will cooperate

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.420
and who will do their jobs, you know,

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.060
both at the kind of meso level,

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.340
the middle level of a bureaucracy,

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:47.060
but also at the everyday level.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:48.700
You know, people who have to pull the triggers

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.380
and that kind of thing and, you know,

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.220
force people into the gas chamber and grab people,

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:57.580
you know, in Kiev in September 1941 at Babinyar

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:00.540
and push them, you know, towards the ravine

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:03.900
where the machine gunners are gonna shoot them down,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.740
you know, and those are all different questions.

01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:11.580
The question of, you know, especially the lower level,

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.820
people who actually do the killing

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:15.980
is a question which I think we've been talking about,

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.460
which is that within all of us,

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.980
you know, is the capability of being murderers

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.420
and mass murderers, I mean, to participate in mass murder.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.860
I won't call them laws of social psychology,

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:31.220
but the character of social psychology.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.380
You know, we will do it in most cases.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.700
I mean, one of the shocking things that I learned

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:39.020
just a few years ago studying the Holocaust

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.860
is that you could pull out.

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.340
In other words, if they order a police battalion

01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:47.660
to go shoot Jews, you didn't have to do it.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.620
You could pull out.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.500
They weren't gonna, they never killed anybody.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.220
They never executed anybody.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.820
They never even punished people for saying,

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.420
no, I'm not gonna do that.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.540
So people are doing it voluntarily.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.980
They may not want to do it.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.660
You know, they give them booze to try to, you know,

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.300
numb the pain of murder,

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:09.140
because they know there is pain.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.540
I mean, people experience pain when they murder people,

01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.740
but they don't pull out.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:17.660
And so it's the character of who we are in the society,

01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:21.100
in groups, and we're very, very influenced.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.740
I mean, we're highly influenced

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.660
by the groups in which we operate.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.100
And, you know, who we talk to

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.980
and who our friends are within that group

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.900
and who is the head of the group.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.260
And I mean, you see this even, I mean, you see it in any group,

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.220
you know, whether it's in the academy, right?

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.380
At Stanford or whether it's, you know, in a labor union

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:46.100
or whether it's in a church group in Tennessee or wherever,

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:49.260
you know, people pay attention to each other

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.260
and they are unwilling frequently to say, no,

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.220
this is wrong.

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.260
Even though all of you think it's right, it's wrong.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:00.900
I mean, you just don't do that usually,

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:05.900
especially in societies that are authoritarian

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:08.100
or totalitarian, right?

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.940
Because it's harder, because there's a backup to it, right?

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:13.380
There's the NKVD there, or there's the Gestapo there,

01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:14.780
and there are other people there.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.900
So you just, you know, they may not be forcing you to do it,

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:21.300
but your social being,

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:27.300
plus this danger in the distance, you know, you do it.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.260
But then if you go up the hierarchy,

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.460
at the very top there's a dictator,

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:36.340
presumably, you know, you go to like middle management

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.500
to the bureaucracy.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:41.140
The higher you get up there,

01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.340
the more power you have to change the direction

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:45.540
of the Titanic.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.940
Right, right, right.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:49.180
But nobody seems to do it.

01:03:49.180 --> 01:03:50.820
Right, or what happens,

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.580
and it does happen,

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.620
it happens in the German army.

01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:57.660
I mean, it happens in the case of the Armenian genocide,

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.180
where we know there are governors who said,

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.460
no, I'm not gonna kill Armenians.

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.460
What kind of business is this?

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.620
They're just removed.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.860
They're removed, and you find a replacement very easily.

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.580
So, you know, you do see people who stand up,

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.660
and again, it's not really predictable who it will be.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.980
I would maintain, I mean, I haven't done the study

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:19.220
of the Armenian governors who said no.

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.140
I mean, the Turkish governors who said no

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.580
to the Armenian genocide.

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:28.420
But, you know, there are people who do step aside

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.060
every once in a while in the middle level,

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:32.620
and again, they're German generals who say,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:34.420
wait a minute, what is this business in Poland

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.900
when they start to kill Jews or in Belarusia?

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.420
And, you know, they're just pushed aside.

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:42.980
You know, if they don't do their job, they're pushed aside.

01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.060
Or they end up doing it,

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.860
and they usually do end up doing it.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.740
What about on the victim side?

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.780
So, I mentioned man's search for meaning.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.380
What can we learn about human nature,

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.660
the human mind from the victims of genocide?

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.380
So, Viktor Frankl talked about the ability

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:06.060
to discover meaning and beauty, even in suffering.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:10.180
Is there something to be said about, you know,

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:11.740
in your studying of genocide

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:13.700
that you've learned about human nature?

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:18.380
Well, again, I don't, I have to say,

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.060
I come out of the study of genocide

01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.100
with a very pessimistic view of human nature,

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.580
a very pessimistic view.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.740
Even on the victim side.

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.540
Even on the victim side.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:32.540
I mean, the victims will eat their children, right?

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.020
Ukrainian case, they have no choice.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.660
You know, the victims will rob each other.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:42.660
The victims will form hierarchies within victimhood.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.380
So, you see, let me give you an example.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:49.540
Again, I told you I was working on Majdanek.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:55.500
And there's, in Majdanek, at a certain point in 42,

01:05:57.340 --> 01:06:02.340
a group of Slovak Jews were arrested and sent to Majdanek.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:08.020
Those Slovak Jews were a group,

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.940
somehow they stuck together, they were very competent,

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.900
they were, you know, many of them were businessmen,

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.460
they knew each other.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.900
And for a variety of different reasons within the camp.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.340
And again, this shows you the diversity of the camps

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:24.580
and also, you know, these images of black and white

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.780
in the camps are not very useful.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.060
They ruled the camp.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.140
I mean, they basically had all the important jobs

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:34.860
in the camp, including jobs like beating other Jews

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:40.780
and persecuting other Jews and persecuting other peoples.

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.580
Which they did.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.380
And this Polish guy who I mentioned to you,

01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.780
who wrote this memoir, hated them

01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:53.580
because of what they were doing to the Poles, right?

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:57.500
And he, you know, he's incensed

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.220
because aren't these supposed to be the Untermenschen?

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.700
He says, and look what they're doing.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.220
They're treating us, you know, like dirt.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.820
And they do, they treat them like dirt.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.500
So, you know, in this kind of work on Majdanek,

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:16.060
there's certainly parts of it that, you know,

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:20.900
we're inspiring, you know, people helping each other,

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:23.140
people trying to feed each other,

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.980
people giving warmth to each other.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:30.460
You know, there's some very heroic Polish women

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.820
who end up having a radio show called Radio Majdanek,

01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.500
which they put on every night in the women's camp,

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.460
which is, you know, to raise people's spirits.

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.460
And they, you know, sing songs

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.100
and do all this kind of stuff, you know,

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:48.020
to try to keep themselves from, you know,

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.140
the horrors that they're experiencing around them.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:54.740
And so you do see that and you do see, you know,

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:59.740
human beings acting in support of each other.

01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:04.860
But, you know, I mean, Primo Levi

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.820
is one of my favorite writers about the Holocaust

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:10.380
and about the camps.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:15.140
And, you know, I don't think Primo Levi saw anything.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.460
You know, I mean, he had pals, you know,

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.100
who he helped and who helped him.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:25.100
I mean, but he describes this kind of, you know,

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:28.940
terrible inhuman environment, which no one can escape,

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:30.500
really, no one can escape.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.300
He ends up committing suicide too, I think,

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:37.300
because of his sense of, we don't know exactly why,

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.500
but probably because of his sense

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500
of what happened in the camp.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.940
I mean, later he goes back to Italy,

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:44.620
becomes a writer and that sort of thing.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:49.380
So I don't, especially in the concentration camps,

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.980
it's really hard to find places like Vickle-Frankel

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:57.980
where you can say, you know, I am moved in a positive way,

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.620
moved in a positive way, you know, by what happened.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:04.300
There were cases, there's no question.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.340
People hung together, they tried to help each other,

01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:11.340
but, you know, they were totally, totally caught

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:15.740
in this web of genocide.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.740
See, so there are stories, but the thing is,

01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:21.340
I have this sense, maybe it's a hope,

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.420
that within most, if not every human heart,

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.420
there's a kind of like flame of compassion

01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:34.820
and kindness and love that waits,

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.220
that longs to connect with others,

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:41.020
that ultimately unmasks, overpowers everything else.

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.380
If you just look at the story of human history,

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:49.300
the resistance to violence and mass murder and genocide

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.860
feels like a force that's there.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:57.220
And it feels like a force that's more powerful

01:09:57.220 --> 01:10:02.220
than whatever the dark momentum that leads to genocide is.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.740
It feels like that's more powerful, it's just quiet.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:10.740
It's hard to tell the story of that little flame

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:14.100
that burns within all of our hearts,

01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.580
that longing to connect to other human beings.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.980
And there's something also about human nature

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.620
and us as storytellers that we're not very good

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.060
at telling the stories of that little flame.

01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:27.060
We're much better at telling the stories of atrocities.

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.380
No, I think maybe I fundamentally disagree with you.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.620
I think maybe I fundamentally,

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:35.300
I don't disagree that there is that flame.

01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:38.940
I just think it's just too easily doused.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:43.380
And I think it's too easily goes out in a lot of people.

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:48.380
And I mean, like I say, I come away from this work,

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.860
a pessimist.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.660
There is this work by a Harvard psychologist,

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.500
now I'm forgetting it.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.580
Steven Pinker.

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.260
Yes, yes.

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:00.380
Steven Pinker that shows over time,

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:03.460
and initially I was quite skeptical of the work,

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.860
but in the end I thought he was quite convincing

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:12.260
that over time the incidence of homicide goes down.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.900
The incidence of rape goes down.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:19.180
The incidence of genocide, except for the big blip

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:22.300
in the middle of the 20th century goes down.

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.860
Not markedly, but it goes down generally

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.420
that norms, international norms are changing

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.140
how we think about this and stuff like that.

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:33.100
I thought he was pretty convincing about that,

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:37.260
but think about we're modern people.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:42.020
I mean, we've advanced so fast in so many different areas.

01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:45.220
I mean, we should have eliminated this a long time ago,

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.460
a long time ago.

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:52.460
How is it that we're still facing this business

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:57.740
of genocide in Myanmar and Xinjiang and Tigray in Ethiopia,

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:04.260
the potentials of genocide there and all over the world.

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:08.300
We still have this thing that we cannot handle,

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:10.260
that we can't deal with.

01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:15.260
And again, electric cars and planes that fly from here

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:19.860
to Beijing, think about the differences

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.980
between 250 years ago or 300 years ago and today.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.780
But the differences in genocide are not all that great.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:28.700
I mean, the incidence has gone down.

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.460
I think Pinker has demonstrated.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.860
I mean, there are problems with his methodology,

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.460
but on the whole I'm with him on that book.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.980
I thought in the end it was quite well done.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.980
So, I have to say I'm not,

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:48.980
I'm not an optimist about what this human flame can do.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:53.060
And I once, someone once said to me,

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:56.340
when I posed a similar kind of question to a seminar,

01:12:56.340 --> 01:12:57.980
a friend of mine at Berkeley once said,

01:12:57.980 --> 01:13:00.700
remember original sin, Norman.

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.700
Well, I don't, that's very Catholic

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:07.340
and I don't really think in terms of original sin.

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:11.820
But in some ways, her point is we carry this with us.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:16.820
We carry with us a really potentially nasty mean streak

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.380
that can do harm to other people.

01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:24.660
But we carry the capacity to love too.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:25.580
Yes, we do.

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.540
And so as we do, that's part of the deal.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:32.140
You have a bias in that you have studied

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.940
some of the darker aspects of human nature

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.620
and human history.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:41.060
So, it is difficult from the trenches,

01:13:41.060 --> 01:13:46.060
from the muck to see a possible sort of way out through love.

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:50.540
But it's not obvious that that's not the case.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:54.820
You mentioned electric cars and rockets and airplanes.

01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:58.860
To me, the more powerful thing is Wikipedia, the internet.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:02.420
Only 50% of the world currently has access to the internet,

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.940
but that's growing in information and knowledge and wisdom,

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.220
especially among women in the world.

01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.860
As that grows, I think it becomes a lot more difficult if love wins.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.140
It becomes a lot more difficult for somebody like Hitler

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:18.420
to take power, for genocide to occur.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.420
Because people think, and the masses, I think,

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.180
the people have power when they're able to think.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.180
When they can see the full kind of...

01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:34.060
First of all, when they can study your work,

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:36.340
they can know about the fact that genocide happens,

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:40.460
how it occurs, how the promises of great charismatic leaders

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:44.820
lead to great destructive mass genocide.

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.940
And just even studying the fact that the Holocaust happened

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.860
for a large number of people

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:54.620
is a powerful preventer of future genocide.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.620
Like, one of the lessons of history

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.980
is just knowing that this can happen,

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:04.540
learning how it happens that normal human beings,

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:07.180
leaders that give big promises,

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.580
can also become evil and destructive.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.900
The fact, knowing that that can happen is a powerful preventer of that.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.780
And then you kind of wake up from this haze of

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.820
believing everything you hear,

01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:25.700
and you learn to just, in your small local way,

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.940
to put more love out there in the world.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.660
I believe it's possible, it's not to push back.

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.020
I'm not, it's not so obvious to me that in the end,

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:40.060
I think in the end, love wins.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.020
That's my intuition, but money on it.

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:46.660
I have a sense that this genocide thing

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:51.260
is more and more going to be an artifact of the past.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.140
Well, I certainly hope you're right.

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.540
I mean, I certainly hope you're right.

01:15:54.540 --> 01:16:00.180
And, you know, it could be you are, we don't know.

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.020
But the evidence is different.

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.260
The evidence is different.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:10.900
And, you know, the capacity of human beings to do evil

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.780
to other human beings is repeatedly demonstrated.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:22.260
You know, whether it's in massacres in Mexico or, you know,

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:26.420
ISIS and the Yazidi Kurds or, you know,

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.700
you can just go on and on. Syria.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.340
I mean, look what, I mean, Syria used to be a country,

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:36.220
you know, and now it's, you know, it's been a mass grave

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.940
and people then have left in the millions,

01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:41.140
you know, for other places.

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:46.140
And, you know, I'm not saying, you know, I'm not saying,

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:48.980
I mean, the Turks have done nice things for the Syrians

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.140
and the Germans welcomed in a million or so

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.380
and actually reasonably absorbed them.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:54.260
I mean, it's all, it's not,

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.660
I'm not saying bad things only happen in the world.

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:59.140
They're good and bad things that happen.

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.180
You're absolutely right.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.900
And, but I don't think we're on the path

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.420
to eliminating these bad things,

01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:10.180
really bad things from happening.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.220
I just don't think we are.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.020
And I don't think there's any,

01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:15.540
I don't think the facts demonstrated.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.340
I mean, I hope, I hope you're right.

01:17:17.340 --> 01:17:20.980
But I think otherwise, otherwise it's just an article of faith.

01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:25.540
Well, you know, which is perfectly fine.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.300
It's better to have that article of faith

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.980
than to have a article of faith which says,

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.180
you know, things should get bad or things like that.

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.940
Well, it's not, it's not just fine.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.900
It's the only way if you want to build a better future.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.780
So optimism is a prerequisite

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.580
for engineering a better future.

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:44.660
So like, okay, so a historian has to see clearly

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.140
into the past.

01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.140
An engineer has to imagine a future

01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:54.260
that's different from the past,

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.020
that's better than the past.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.460
Because without that,

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.540
they're not going to be able to build a better future.

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.260
So there's a kind of saying,

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.660
like you have to consider the facts.

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.620
Well, at every single moment in history,

01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:10.180
if you allow yourself to be too grounded

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.340
by the facts of the past,

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.820
you're not going to create the future.

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:15.180
So that's kind of the tension that we're living with.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.020
To have a chance,

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:19.540
we have to imagine that the better future is possible.

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:23.980
But one of the ways to do that is to study history.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:26.500
Which engineers don't do enough of.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.340
They do not.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:29.260
Which is a real problem.

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:30.980
It's a real problem.

01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.140
Or basically a lot of disciplines in science

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.180
and so on don't do enough of.

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:41.340
Can you tell the story of China from 1958 to 1962,

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.940
what was called the Great Leap Forward,

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.380
orchestrated by Chairman Mao Zedong

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:49.740
that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:53.540
making it arguably the largest famine in human history.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:59.820
Yes, I mean, it was a terrible set of events

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:02.180
that led to the death.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.020
People will dispute the numbers.

01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:12.020
15 million, 17 million, 14 million, 20 million people

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.300
died in the Great Leap.

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:17.380
Many people say 30, 40, 50 million.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.940
Some people will go that high too.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.020
That's right, that's right.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.220
Essentially, Mao and the Communist Party leadership,

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.460
but it was mostly Mao's doing,

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:33.180
decided he wanted to move the country into communism.

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.940
And part of the idea of that

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.900
was rivalry with the Soviet Union.

01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:41.180
Mao was a good Stalinist,

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.860
or at least felt like Stalin was the right

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.340
kind of communist leader to have.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.060
And he didn't like Khrushchev at all.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:51.180
And he didn't like what he thought were Khrushchev's reforms

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:54.140
and also Khrushchev's pretensions

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:57.140
to moving the Soviet Union into communism.

01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.700
So Khrushchev started talking about giving more power

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.740
to the party, less power to the state.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.500
And if you have more power to the party versus the state,

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.220
then you're moving into communism quicker.

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:11.380
So what Mao decided to do was to engage in this vast program

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:16.980
of building what were called people's communes.

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:22.020
And these communes were enormous conglomerations

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:25.540
of essentially collective farms.

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.420
And what would happen on those communes

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.580
is there would be places for people to eat

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.940
and there would be places for the kids to be raised

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:38.060
in essentially kind of separate homes

01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:40.020
and they would be schooled.

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.740
Everybody would turn over their metal,

01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.180
which was one of the actually turned out

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:46.820
to be terribly negative phenomenon.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.060
Their metal pots and pans to be melted

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.740
to then make steel.

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:54.300
Every of these big communes would all have

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:57.340
little steel plants and they would build steel

01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:01.380
and the whole countryside would be transformed.

01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:06.380
Well, like many of these sort of true megalomaniac project,

01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.260
like some of Stalin's projects too.

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:13.020
And this particular project then,

01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:15.300
the people had no choice.

01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:18.740
They were forced to do this.

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:23.740
It was incredibly dysfunctional for Chinese agriculture

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.020
and ended up creating, as you mentioned,

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:34.100
a terrible famine that everybody understood

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:36.460
was a famine as a result of this.

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.380
I mean, there were also some problems of nature

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.740
at the same time and some flooding and bad weather

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:43.820
and that sort of thing.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.140
But it was really a manmade famine.

01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:51.140
And Mao said at one point, who cares if millions die?

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:53.940
It just doesn't matter.

01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.340
We've got millions more left.

01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:57.820
I mean, he would periodically say things like this

01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:02.820
that show that like Stalin, he had a total indifference

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:06.340
to the fact that people were dying in large numbers.

01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:11.340
It led again to cannibalism and to terrible wastage

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:15.100
all over the country and millions of people died.

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.180
And there was just no stopping it.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.700
There were people in the party who began to kind of edge

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:24.980
towards telling Mao this wasn't a great idea

01:22:24.980 --> 01:22:28.460
and that he should back off, but he wouldn't back off.

01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:32.100
And the result was catastrophe in the countryside

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:33.260
and all these people dying.

01:22:33.260 --> 01:22:35.820
And then they compounding the problem

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.180
was the political elite,

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:41.180
which then if peasants would object

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:43.580
or if certain people would say, no,

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.060
they beat the hell out of them.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:47.900
They would beat people who didn't do

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.180
what they wanted them to do.

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:54.180
So it was really, really a horrific set of events

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.300
on the Chinese countryside.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.580
I mean, and people wrote about it.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.500
I mean, we learned about it.

01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:05.980
There were people who were keeping track

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.100
of what was going on and eventually wrote books about it.

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.060
So we have, I mean, we have pretty good documentation,

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.180
not so much on the numbers.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:17.780
Numbers are always a difficult problem.

01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:19.180
I'm facing this problem by the way,

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:23.180
this is a little bit separate with the Holodomor

01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:26.740
where Ukrainians are now claiming 11.5 million people died

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.060
in the Holodomor.

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:29.820
And most people assume it's somewhere

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.220
in the neighborhood of 4 million, 4.5 million maybe.

01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.740
So you have wildly different numbers

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.420
that come out and we have different kinds of numbers

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:41.620
as you mentioned too with the Great Leap Forward.

01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:45.300
So it was a huge catastrophe for China

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.900
and now only backed off when he had to.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.900
And then revived a little bit with the Red Guards movement

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:58.060
later on when he was upset that the bureaucracy

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.700
was resisting him a little bit when it came to the Great Leap

01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:03.340
but he had to back off.

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.980
It was such a terrible catastrophe.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.620
So one of the things about numbers

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:10.420
is that you usually talk about deaths

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.340
but with the famine, with starvation,

01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:16.860
the thing I often think about

01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:18.620
that's impossible to put into numbers

01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:22.020
is the number of people and the degree

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.060
to which they were suffering.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:28.820
You know, the number of days spent in suffering.

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:30.060
Oh yeah.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:31.740
And so, I mean, death is,

01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:39.740
death is just one of the consequences of suffering.

01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.740
To me, it feels like one, two, three years or months

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:48.740
and then years of not having anything to eat is worse.

01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:55.260
And it's sort of those aren't put into numbers often.

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:56.100
That's right.

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:58.180
And the effect on people long-term, you know,

01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.500
in terms of their mental health,

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:03.620
in terms of their physical health, their ability to work,

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:05.180
all those kinds of things, you know.

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:07.620
I mean, Ukrainians are working on,

01:25:07.620 --> 01:25:09.260
there are people working on this subject now,

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.980
you know, the long-term effect of the hunger famine on them.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:16.180
And I'm sure there's a similar kind of long-term effect

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.060
on Chinese peasantry of what happened.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:20.020
You know, I mean, you're destroying-

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:20.980
Multi-generational.

01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.020
Yes, multi-generational, that's right.

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:23.860
That's right. Wow.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.540
And, you know, it's a really, you're absolutely right.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.140
This is a terrible, terrible way to die.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:31.500
And it lasts a long time.

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.340
And sometimes you don't die, you survive,

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:37.220
but, you know, in the kind of shape

01:25:37.220 --> 01:25:39.820
where you can't do anything.

01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.100
I mean, you can't function.

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.900
Now your brain's been injured, you know.

01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:49.220
I know it's a really, these famines are really horrible.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.060
You're right.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:50.980
So when you talk about genocide,

01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:52.460
it's often talking about murder.

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.300
Yeah.

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:55.180
Where do you place North Korea in this discussion?

01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:56.940
You kind of mentioned it.

01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:00.380
So in the, what is it, the Arduous March

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:08.100
of the 1990s, where was mass starvation?

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:11.300
Many people describe mass starvation going on.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:14.340
Now in North Korea, when you think about genocide,

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.740
when you think about atrocities going on

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:20.740
in the world today, where do you place North Korea?

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:24.780
So take a step back, when there were all these courts

01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.100
that were set up for Bosnia and for Rwanda

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:33.100
and for other genocides in the 1990s.

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:37.340
And then the decision was made

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.860
by the international community, UN basically,

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.100
to set up the International Criminal Court,

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:47.500
which would then try genocide in the more modern period

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.540
and the more contemporary period.

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:54.540
And the ICC lists three crimes, basically.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:27:00.220
The genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:07.180
And subsumed to crimes against humanity

01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.340
are a lot of the kinds of things you're talking about

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:10.780
with North Korea.

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:13.700
I mean, it's torture, it's artificial,

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.860
sometimes artificial famine or famine that is not,

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.020
not necessary, right?

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:23.020
Not necessary to have it.

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:28.340
There are other kinds of mass rape and stuff like that.

01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.140
There are other kinds of things that fit

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.460
into the crimes against humanity.

01:27:33.460 --> 01:27:36.380
And that's sort of where I think about North Korea

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:39.180
as committing crimes against humanity, not genocide.

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:43.180
And again, remember genocide is meant to be,

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:46.860
I mean, some people, there's a disagreement

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.820
among scholars and jurists about this.

01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.900
Some people think of genocide as the crime of crimes,

01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:55.140
the worst of the three that I just mentioned.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:56.980
But some think of them as co-equal.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:00.460
And the ICC, the International Criminal Court,

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:03.300
is dealing with them more or less as co-equal,

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.500
even though we tend to think of genocide as the worst.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.260
So, I mean, what I'm trying to say is that,

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.660
I don't wanna split hairs.

01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.740
I think it's sort of morally and ethically unseemly,

01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.980
the split hairs about what is genocide

01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:20.940
and what is a crime against humanity.

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:23.020
This is for lawyers, not for historians.

01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:24.100
Terminology wise.

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.340
Yeah, yeah, you don't wanna get into that

01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:32.140
because it, I mean, it happened with Darfur a little bit

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.620
where the Bush administration had declared

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.540
that Darfur was a genocide and the UN said, no, no,

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:43.300
it wasn't genocide, it was a crime against humanity.

01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:47.260
And that confused things versus clarified them.

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:49.300
I mean, we damn well knew what was happening.

01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:51.460
People were being killed and being attacked.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:56.980
And so, on the one hand, I think the whole concept

01:28:56.980 --> 01:29:01.980
and the way of thinking about history using genocide

01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:07.220
as an important part of human history is crucial.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:13.060
On the other hand, I don't like to get involved

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:15.380
in the hair splitting of what's genocide and what's not.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.220
So that, North Korea, I tend to think of, like I said,

01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:22.660
as committing crimes against humanity

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:25.580
and forcibly incarcerating people,

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:28.380
torturing them, that kind of thing.

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:30.980
Routinely incarcerating, depriving them

01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:33.660
of certain kinds of human rights

01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.740
can be considered a crime against humanity.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:38.300
But I don't think of it in the same way I think

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:40.820
about genocide, which is an attack on a group of people.

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:42.780
Let me just leave it at that.

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.820
What in this, if we think about, if it's okay,

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.180
can we loosely use the term genocide here?

01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.940
Let's not play games with terminology.

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:54.740
Just bad crimes against humanity.

01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:58.660
Of particular interest are the ones

01:29:58.660 --> 01:30:01.660
that are going on today still,

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:04.500
because it raises the question to us,

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.980
what do people outside of this,

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.380
what role do they have to play?

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:12.420
So what role does the United States,

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:16.660
or what role do I as a human being

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:19.860
who has food today, who has shelter,

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:21.460
who has a comfortable life,

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:26.140
what role do I have when I think about North Korea,

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:27.380
when I think about Syria,

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:31.500
when I think about maybe the Uyghur population in China?

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.100
Well, I mean, the role is the same role I have,

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:38.420
which is to teach and to learn

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:43.420
and to get the message out that this is happening.

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:45.780
Because the more people who understand it,

01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:48.620
the more likely it is that the United States government

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.620
will try to do something about it

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.700
within the context of who we are and where we live, right?

01:30:56.700 --> 01:31:00.900
And so, I write books, you do shows.

01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:04.700
Maybe you write books too, I don't know.

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.900
I do not write books, but I tweet.

01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.940
You tweet, okay, that's good too.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.460
Inelegantly, but that's not the,

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:14.380
I guess that's not the, yes, so certainly this is true.

01:31:14.380 --> 01:31:17.060
And in terms of a voice, in terms of words,

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:20.740
in terms of books, you are in, I would say a rare example

01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:25.100
of somebody that has powerful reach with words.

01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:27.220
But I was also referring to actions.

01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.260
In the United States government,

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.780
what are the options here?

01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:36.780
So war has costs and war seems to be,

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:39.100
as you have described,

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:43.260
sort of potentially increased the atrocity, not decrease it.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:48.460
If there's anything that challenges my hope for the future

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:52.940
is the fact that sometimes we're not powerless to help,

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.980
but very close to powerless to help.

01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:00.260
Because trying to help can often lead to,

01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:04.660
in the near term, more negative effects than positive effects.

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:05.620
That's exactly right.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.180
I mean, the unintended consequences of what we do

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:13.540
can frequently be as bad, if not worse,

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.060
than trying to relieve the difficulties

01:32:17.060 --> 01:32:17.900
that people are having.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.500
So I think you're caught a little bit,

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.220
but it's also true, I think that we can be more forceful.

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.780
I think we can be more forceful without necessarily war.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:34.620
There is this idea of the so-called responsibility to protect.

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:38.980
And this was an idea that came up after Kosovo,

01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.820
which was what, 1999.

01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:47.860
And when the Serbs looked like they were gonna engage

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.580
in a genocidal program in Kosovo,

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.220
and it was basically a program of ethnic cleansing,

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:56.260
but it could have gone bad and gotten worse,

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:59.580
not just driving people out, but beginning to kill them.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:04.580
And the United States and Britain and others intervened.

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:08.900
And Russians were there too, as you probably recall.

01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:13.900
And I think, correctly, people have analyzed this

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:18.980
as a case in which genocide was prevented or stopped.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:22.060
In other words, the Serbs were stopped in their tracks.

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.460
I mean, some bad things did happen.

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:25.660
We bombed Belgrade and the Chinese embassy

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:30.660
and things like that, but it was stopped.

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:33.340
And following upon that, then there was a kind

01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:36.940
of international consensus that we needed to do something.

01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:41.460
Because of Rwanda, Bosnia, and the positive example

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:46.460
of Kosovo, that genocide did not happen in Kosovo.

01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:50.740
I think that argument has been substantiated.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:55.740
Anyway, and this notion of the, or this doctrine

01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:00.860
or whatever of the responsibility to protect them

01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:05.860
was adopted by the UN in 2005, unanimously.

01:34:06.380 --> 01:34:11.380
And what it says is, there's a hierarchy of measures

01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:15.020
that should be, well, let me take a step back.

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:20.020
It starts with the principle that sovereignty of a country

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:24.860
is not, you don't earn it just by being there

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.340
and being your own country.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.940
You have to earn it by protecting your people.

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:32.860
So every, this was all agreed

01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:35.180
with all the nations of the UN agreed, you know,

01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.020
Chinese and Russians too, that, you know, sovereignty

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:43.340
is there because you protect your people

01:34:43.340 --> 01:34:46.380
against various depredations, right?

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:49.740
Including genocide, crimes against humanity, you know,

01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:52.820
forced imprisonment, torture, and that sort of thing.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:57.820
If you violate that justification for your sovereignty,

01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:01.460
that you're protecting your people,

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.260
that you're not protecting them,

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:06.860
the international community has the obligation

01:35:06.860 --> 01:35:09.020
to do something about it, all right?

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.220
Now, then they have a kind of hierarchy of things

01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:14.140
you can do, you know, starting with,

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.020
I mean, I'm not quoting exactly,

01:35:17.020 --> 01:35:19.660
but you know, starting with kind of push and pull, you know,

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:22.620
trying to convince people, don't do that, you know,

01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:26.020
to Myanmar, don't do that to the Rohingya people, right?

01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.500
Then it goes down a list, you know,

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:30.980
and you get to a list of sanctions

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:34.060
or threatening sanctions and then sanctions, you know,

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:38.580
like we have against Russia, but you go down the list, right?

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.260
You go down the list and eventually

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.420
you get to military intervention at the bottom,

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.900
which they say is the last thing, you know,

01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.180
and you really don't wanna do that.

01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:52.060
And not only do you not wanna do it,

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:54.780
but it had, just as you said, just as you pointed out,

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:58.260
it can have unintended consequences, right?

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:02.020
And we'll do everything we can short, you know,

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:06.340
of military intervention, but, you know, if necessary,

01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:09.100
that can be undertaken as well.

01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.340
And so the responsibility to predict, I think,

01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:16.340
is, you know, it was not implementable.

01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:20.660
One of the things it says in this last category, right?

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:23.540
The military intervention is that the intervention

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:28.540
cannot create more damage than it relieves, right?

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:34.060
And so for Syria, we came to the conclusion, you know,

01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:37.620
that, I mean, the international community in some ways

01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:39.660
said this in so many words,

01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:41.500
even though the Russians were there, obviously,

01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.260
we ended up being there and that sort of thing,

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.460
but the international community basically said,

01:36:45.460 --> 01:36:48.260
you know, there's no way you can intervene in Syria.

01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.140
You know, there's just no way without causing more damage,

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.260
you know, than you would relieve.

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.860
So, you know, in some senses,

01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.500
that's what the international community is saying

01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:02.100
about Xinjiang and the Uyghurs too.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.780
You know, I mean, you can't even imagine

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.100
what hell would break loose

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:09.860
if there was some kind of military trouble,

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:12.780
you know, to threaten the Chinese with.

01:37:12.780 --> 01:37:16.380
But you can go down that list

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.780
with, you know, the military leadership of Myanmar

01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.180
and you can go down that list

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:23.500
with the Chinese Communist Party

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.500
and you can go down the list, you know,

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:30.500
with others who are threatening, you know, with Ethiopia

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:33.900
and what it's doing in Tigray.

01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:37.940
And, you know, you can go down that list and start pushing.

01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.260
I think what happened,

01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.420
there was more of a willingness in the 90s

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.700
and in, you know, right at the turn of the century,

01:37:48.700 --> 01:37:50.780
you know, to do these kinds of things.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:52.860
And then, you know, when Trump got elected

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:54.620
and, you know, he basically said, you know,

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.260
America first and out of the world,

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.620
we're not gonna do any of this kind of stuff.

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:00.780
And now Biden has the problem

01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:02.460
of trying to rebuild consensus

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:06.740
on how you deal with these kinds of things.

01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.660
I think it's not impossible.

01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.500
I mean, here, I tend to be maybe more of an optimist than you.

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.540
You know, I think it's not impossible

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:16.700
that the international community can, you know,

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:20.620
muster some internal fortitude

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:25.620
and push harder, short of war, you know,

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:30.660
to get the Chinese and to get the, again, Myanmar

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:34.100
and to get others to kind of back off

01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:36.020
of violations of people's rights

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.340
the way they are routinely doing it.

01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.020
So that's in the space of geopolitics.

01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:42.860
That's the space of politicians and UN and so on.

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.460
The interesting thing about China,

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.060
and this is a difficult topic,

01:38:47.060 --> 01:38:52.060
but there's so many financial interests

01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:58.580
that not many voices with power and with money

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:02.460
speak up, speak out against China.

01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:06.740
Because it's a very interesting effect

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:11.180
because it costs a lot for an individual to speak up

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:13.820
because you're going to suffer.

01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.060
I mean, China just cuts off the market.

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:20.060
Like if you have a product, if you have a company

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:22.220
and you say something negative, China just says,

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:25.180
okay, well then they knock you out of the market.

01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:27.500
And so any person speaks up,

01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.860
they get shut down immediately financially.

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:33.220
It's a huge cost sometimes, millions or billions of dollars.

01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:36.580
And so what happens is everybody of consequences,

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:39.580
sort of financially, everybody with a giant platform

01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.300
is extremely hesitant to speak out.

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:45.300
It's a different kind of hesitation.

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.020
It's financial in nature.

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:48.740
I don't know if that was always the case.

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:51.060
It seems like in history,

01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:53.780
people were quiet because of fear,

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.980
because of threat of violence.

01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:00.740
Here, there's almost like a self-interested preservation

01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:04.340
of financial, of wealth.

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.300
And I don't know what to do that.

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:09.460
I mean, I don't know if you can say something there.

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:14.460
Like the genocide going on

01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.420
because people are financially self-interested.

01:40:18.420 --> 01:40:22.060
Yeah, no, I think the analysis is correct.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:26.180
And it's not only corporations,

01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.260
but it's the American government

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.380
that represents the American people

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:35.380
that also feels compelled not to challenge the Chinese

01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.380
on human rights issues.

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:42.500
But the interesting thing is it's not just,

01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:44.380
I know a lot of people from China,

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.100
and first of all, amazing human beings

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:49.060
and a lot of brilliant people in China,

01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:50.900
they also don't want to speak out.

01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.580
And not because they're sort of quote unquote silenced,

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.540
but more because they're going to also lose financially.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.620
They have a lot of businesses in China.

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:04.300
They're running, in fact, the Chinese government

01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.460
and the country has a very interesting structure

01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:11.380
because it has a lot of elements that enable capitalism

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:13.860
within a certain framework.

01:41:13.860 --> 01:41:16.580
So you have a lot of very successful companies

01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.220
and they operate successfully.

01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:19.900
And then the leaders of those companies,

01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.660
many of whom have either been on this podcast,

01:41:24.660 --> 01:41:25.940
they want to be on this podcast,

01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:28.220
they really don't want to say anything negative

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.420
about the government.

01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:32.820
And the nature of the fear I sense

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.380
is not the kind of fear you would have in Nazi Germany.

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.260
It's a very kind of, it's a mellow,

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:42.980
like why would I speak out

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.660
when it has a negative effect on my company,

01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:48.740
on my family, in terms of finance, strictly financially.

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:53.940
And that's difficult.

01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:56.100
That's a different problem to solve.

01:41:56.100 --> 01:41:57.700
That feels solvable

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:00.140
because it feels like it's a money problem.

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:02.380
If you can control the flow of money

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:05.700
where the government has less power

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:06.900
to control the flow of money,

01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:08.860
it feels like that's solvable.

01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.380
And that's where capitalism is good,

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.620
that's where the free market is good.

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:12.460
So it's like,

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.500
that's where a lot of people in the cryptocurrency space,

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.060
I don't know if you follow them,

01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.740
they kind of say, okay, take the monetary system,

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.620
the power to control money away from governments,

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.460
make it a distribute,

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:26.380
like allow technology to help you with that.

01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:28.780
That's a hopeful message there.

01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:30.060
In fact, a lot of people argue

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:32.020
that kind of Bitcoin and these cryptocurrencies

01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:37.020
can help deal with some of these authoritarian regimes

01:42:38.540 --> 01:42:41.900
that lead to violations of basic human rights.

01:42:41.900 --> 01:42:44.380
If you can give the power

01:42:44.380 --> 01:42:46.140
to control the money to the people,

01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.020
you can take that away from governments.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.780
That's another source of hope

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:52.820
where technology might be able to do something good.

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:53.780
That's something different

01:42:53.780 --> 01:42:56.020
about the 21st century and then the 20th,

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.740
is there's technology in the hands of billions of people.

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.740
I mean, I have to say,

01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:04.700
I think you're a naive when it comes to technology.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.940
I mean, I'm not someone who understands technology,

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:11.660
so it's wrong of me to argue with you

01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:13.860
because I don't really spend much time with it,

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:15.980
I don't really like it very much

01:43:15.980 --> 01:43:20.980
and I'm neither a fan nor a connoisseur,

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.900
so I just don't really know.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:27.780
But what human history has shown basically,

01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.060
and that's a big statement,

01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.100
I don't wanna pretend I can tell you

01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:32.900
what human history has shown,

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:37.220
but technology, atom bomb,

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:39.820
I mean, that's the perfect example of technology.

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:42.140
What happens when you discover new things?

01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:45.100
It's a perfect example, what's going on with Facebook now.

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:47.300
It's an absolutely perfect example.

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:53.700
I once went to a lecture by Eric Schmidt about the future

01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:55.820
and about all the things that were gonna happen

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.140
and all these wonderful things

01:43:57.140 --> 01:43:59.900
like you wouldn't have to translate yourself anything,

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.860
you wouldn't have to read a book,

01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:04.180
you wouldn't have to drive a car,

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:05.740
you don't have to do this, you don't have to do that.

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:07.400
What kind of life is that?

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.060
So my view of technology is it's subsumed

01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:18.220
to the political, social and moral needs of our day

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:20.420
and should be subsumed to that day.

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:22.440
It's not gonna solve anything by itself.

01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:25.540
It's gonna be you and me that solve things

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:26.420
if they're solved.

01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:28.460
There are political systems that solve things.

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:31.500
Technology is neutral on one level.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:33.820
It is simply a human,

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:35.380
I mean, they're talking now about

01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:38.260
how artificial intelligence is gonna do this

01:44:38.260 --> 01:44:39.860
and is gonna do that.

01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:43.700
I'm not so sure there's anything necessarily positive

01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:44.820
or negative about it,

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:47.580
except it does obviously make work easier

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.700
and things like that.

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:53.700
I mean, I like email and I like word processing

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.220
and that sort of, all that stuff is great,

01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.220
but actually solving human relations in and of itself

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:09.460
or international relations or conflict among human beings.

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:14.900
I mean, I see technology as causing as many problems

01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:18.940
as it solves and maybe even more, you know, the kind-

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.540
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:25.260
The question is, so like you said, technology is neutral.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:26.940
I agree with this.

01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:30.460
Technology is a toolkit, is a tool set

01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:34.980
that enables humans to have wider reach and more power.

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.980
The printing press, the rare reason I can read your books

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:42.740
is I would argue, so first of all, the printing press

01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:45.540
and then the internet.

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:50.580
Wikipedia, I think, has immeasurable effect on humanity.

01:45:52.020 --> 01:45:53.900
Technology is a double-edged sword.

01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.300
It allows bad people to do bad things

01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:58.820
and good people to do good things.

01:45:58.820 --> 01:46:02.820
It ultimately boils down to the people

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:05.740
and whether you believe the capacity for good

01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.500
outweighs the capacity of bad.

01:46:07.500 --> 01:46:10.540
And so you said that I'm naive, it is true.

01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.380
I'm naively optimistic.

01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:16.020
I would say you're naively cynical about technology.

01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:20.460
Here we have one overdressed naive optimist

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:23.780
and one brilliant, but nevertheless,

01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:27.060
technologically naive cynic, and we don't know.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:30.340
We don't know whether the capacity for good

01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:34.860
or the capacity for evil wins out in the end.

01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.060
And like we've been talking about,

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:39.940
the trajectory of human history seems to pivot

01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:44.940
on a lot of random seeming moments, so we don't know.

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:50.060
But as a builder of technology, I remain optimistic.

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:56.060
And I should say kind of, when you are optimistic,

01:46:56.260 --> 01:47:01.100
it is often easy to sound naive.

01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:06.340
And I'm not sure what to make of that small effect,

01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:07.820
not to linger on specific words,

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:12.820
but I've noticed that people who kind of are cynical

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:18.220
about the world somehow sound more intelligent.

01:47:18.220 --> 01:47:22.580
No, no, the issue is how can you be realistic

01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.900
about the world?

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:27.300
It's not optimistic or pessimistic, it's not cynical.

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:29.540
The question is, how can you be a realist, right?

01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:31.180
Yes, that's a good question.

01:47:31.180 --> 01:47:36.180
Realism depends on a combination of knowledge

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:42.700
and wisdom and good instincts and that sort of thing.

01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:47.340
And that's what we strive for, is a kind of realism.

01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.180
We both strive for that kind of realism.

01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:53.220
But I mean, here's an example I would give you.

01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:54.660
Now, what about, again,

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:56.580
we've got this environmental issue, right?

01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:01.580
And technology has created it, it's created it.

01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.220
I mean, the growth of technology,

01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:07.100
I mean, we all like to be heated well in our homes

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:09.860
and we wanna have cars that run quickly

01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:13.340
and fast on gas and this, we all,

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.660
I mean, there's all, we're all consumers

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.060
and we all profit from this.

01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:20.180
I don't, not everybody profits from it,

01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:23.220
but we wanna be comfortable.

01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.660
And technology has provided us with a comfortable life.

01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:29.700
And it's also provided us with this incredible danger,

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.700
which it's not solving, at least not now.

01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:32.540
Okay.

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:34.940
And it may solve, but it may, it's only,

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.780
my view is, you know what's gonna happen?

01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.420
A horrible catastrophe.

01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:42.340
It's the only way, it's the only way

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:45.140
we will direct ourselves to actually trying

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:46.540
to do something about it.

01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:53.180
We don't have the wisdom and the realism

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.820
and the sense of purpose.

01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.420
You know, what's your name, Greta goes blah, blah, blah,

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:02.700
something like that in her last talk

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:08.660
about the environmental summit in Glasgow

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:09.780
or whatever it was.

01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:15.900
And, you know, we just don't have it

01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:19.420
unless we're hit upside the head really, really hard.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:22.820
And then maybe, you know, the business

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:25.780
with nuclear weapons, you know,

01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:27.860
I think somehow we got hit upside the head

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:30.380
and we realized, oh man, you know,

01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:32.940
this could really do it to the whole world.

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:36.660
And so we started, you know, serious arms control stuff.

01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.460
And, you know, but up to that point, you know,

01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:43.500
I mean, there was just something about, you know,

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.060
Khrushchev's big bomb, his big hydrogen bomb,

01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:48.340
which he exploded in the times,

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:50.420
I think it was the anniversary or something like that.

01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:51.260
You know, I mean,

01:49:51.260 --> 01:49:53.580
just think what we could have done to each other.

01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:55.620
Well, that's the double-edged sword of technology.

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:57.300
Yeah, I agree, it's a double-edged sword.

01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:59.260
There's a lot of people, there's a lot of people

01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:01.980
that argue that nuclear weapons is the reason

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:03.780
we haven't had a World War III.

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.860
So nuclear weapons, the mutually assured destruction

01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:08.540
leads to a kind of like,

01:50:08.540 --> 01:50:11.220
we've reached a certain level of destructiveness

01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:15.660
with our weapons where we were able to catch ourselves,

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:20.300
not to create, like you said, hit really hard.

01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:25.300
This is the interesting question about kind of hard,

01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:28.620
hard and really hard upside the head

01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:31.660
with the environment, I would argue,

01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:33.900
see, we can't know the future,

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:36.220
but I would argue as the pressure builds,

01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:41.220
there's already, because of this created urgency,

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.640
the amount of innovation that I've seen

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:47.220
that sometimes is unrelated to the environment,

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:50.020
but kind of sparked by this urgency,

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.020
it's been humongous, including the work of Elon Musk,

01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:55.060
including the work of just,

01:50:55.140 --> 01:51:00.140
you could argue that the SpaceX

01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:02.620
and the new exploration of space

01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:06.060
is kind of sparked by this environmental urgency.

01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:08.020
I mean, connected to Tesla and everything they're doing

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:09.780
with electric vehicles and so on,

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.300
there's a huge amount of innovation

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:12.700
in the space that's happening.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:16.700
I could see the effect of climate change

01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:19.820
resulting in more positive innovation

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:22.760
that improves the quality of life across the world

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.820
than the actual catastrophic events

01:51:24.820 --> 01:51:26.380
that we're describing,

01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:28.460
which we cannot even currently predict.

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.660
It's not like there's going to be,

01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:31.580
there's going to be more extreme weather events.

01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:32.820
What does that even mean?

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:35.300
There's going to be a gradual increase

01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:38.460
of the level of water.

01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.740
What does that even mean in terms of catastrophic events?

01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:42.260
It's going to be pretty gradual.

01:51:42.260 --> 01:51:43.500
There's going to be migration of people.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.100
We can't predict what that means.

01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.520
And in response to that,

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.020
there's going to be a huge amount of innovators

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:54.220
born today that have dreams

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.860
and that will build devices and inventions

01:51:56.860 --> 01:52:01.700
and from space to vehicles to in the software world

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:03.740
that enable education across the world,

01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:05.740
all those kinds of things that will,

01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:09.460
on mass, on average, increase the quality of life

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:11.060
on average across the world.

01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:14.500
So it's not at all obvious that these,

01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:17.260
the things, the technologies that are creating

01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:19.940
climate change, global warming,

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:23.500
are going to have a negative, net negative effect.

01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:24.740
We don't know this.

01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:28.860
And I'm kind of inspired by the dreamers,

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:30.860
the engineers, the innovators,

01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:34.140
and the entrepreneurs that build,

01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:37.860
that wake up in the morning, see problems in the world

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.500
and dream that they're going to be the ones

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:40.780
who solve those problems.

01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:43.020
That's the human spirit.

01:52:43.020 --> 01:52:44.500
And that I'm not exactly,

01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:46.740
it is true that we need those deadlines.

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:48.940
We need to be freaking out about stuff.

01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:52.080
And the reason we need to study history

01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:55.040
and the worst of human history is that we can say,

01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:57.040
oh shit, this too can happen.

01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:59.360
It's a slap in the face.

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:01.400
It's a wake up call that if you're,

01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.600
if you get complacent, if you get lazy,

01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.840
this is going to happen.

01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.400
And that, listen,

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.360
there's a lot of really intelligent people,

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.360
ambitious people, dreamers, skilled dreamers

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.480
that build solutions that make sure

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.200
this stuff doesn't happen anymore.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.760
So there's, I think there's reason to be optimistic

01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.800
about technology, not in a naive way.

01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:25.440
There's an argument to be made in a realistic way

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:29.280
that like with technology, we can build a better future.

01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:32.600
And then Facebook is a lesson

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:34.280
in the way Facebook has been done

01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.280
is a lesson how not to do it.

01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:42.280
And that lesson serves as a guide of how to do it better,

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.560
how to do it right, how to do it in a positive way.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:50.040
And the same, every single sort of failed technology

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:53.320
contains within it the lessons of how to do it better.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.440
And I mean, without that,

01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:00.720
what's the source of hope for human civilization?

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:05.840
You know, that, I mean, that by way of question,

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:09.320
you have truly studied some of the darkest moments

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.320
in human history.

01:54:11.640 --> 01:54:13.240
Put on your optimist hat.

01:54:14.400 --> 01:54:15.240
Where-

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.080
That one.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:16.920
Yes.

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:17.760
Okay.

01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:18.600
There-

01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.680
There glimmers of it.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:20.520
Yes.

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:22.320
What is your source of hope

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.640
for the future of human civilization?

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.920
Well, I think it resides in,

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:32.520
you know, some of what you've been saying,

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:36.600
which is the, in the persistence

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.360
of this civilization over time,

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:43.200
despite, you know, the incredible setbacks,

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:45.400
you know, two enormous world wars,

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:47.560
you know, the nuclear standoff,

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:52.720
you know, the horrible things we're experiencing now

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:56.080
with climate change and migration and stuff like that.

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.080
That despite these things, you know, we are persisting

01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:02.400
and we are continuing.

01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:04.560
And like you say, we're continuing to invent

01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:07.720
and we're continuing to try to solve these problems.

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.280
And, you know, we're continuing to love as well as hate.

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:14.600
And, you know, that,

01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.040
you know, I'm basically, I mean,

01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.440
I have children and grandchildren

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:23.840
and I think they're gonna be just fine.

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:27.720
You know, I'm not a doom and gloomer, you know,

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.320
I'm not a Cassandra saying the world is coming to an end.

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.640
I'm not like that at all.

01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:38.120
You know, I think that, you know, things will persist.

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:41.400
Another, by the way, source of tremendous optimism

01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.320
on my part are the kids I teach.

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:49.200
You know, I teach some unbelievably fantastic young people,

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.600
you know, who are sort of like you say,

01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:54.280
they're dreamers and they're problem solvers

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:59.280
and they're, I mean, they have enormously humane values

01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:03.000
and ways of thinking about the world

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.760
and they wanna do good.

01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.400
You know, if you take the kind of,

01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:11.960
I mean, this has probably been true all the way along,

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.840
but I mean, the percentage of do-gooders,

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.760
you know, is really enormously large.

01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:19.840
Now, whether they end up working for some kind of shark law

01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.840
firm or something, or, you know, that kind of thing,

01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:26.840
or whether they end up human rights lawyers

01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.440
as they all wanna be, right?

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:33.720
The, you know, is a different kind of question,

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:38.200
but certainly, you know, these young people are talented,

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.120
they're smart, they have wonderful values,

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.200
they're energetic, they work hard, you know, they're focused.

01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:48.840
And of course, it's not just Stanford.

01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.280
I mean, it's all over the country.

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.520
You know, you have young people

01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:55.960
who really wanna contribute and they wanna contribute.

01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:59.600
I mean, it's true some of them end up, you know,

01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.080
working to get rich.

01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.720
I mean, that's inevitable, right?

01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:07.440
But the percentages are actually rather small,

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:08.760
at least at this age, you know,

01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.680
maybe when they get a mortgage and a family

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.800
and that sort of thing, you know,

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.280
financial well-being will be more important to them.

01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:20.000
But right now, you know, you catch this young generation

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.080
and they're fantastic, they're fantastic.

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.240
And they're not what they're often portrayed as being,

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:30.960
you know, kind of silly and naive and knee-jerk leftists

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:32.560
and they're not at all like that.

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.720
You know, they're really fine young people.

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:40.400
So that's a source of optimism to me too.

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.000
What advice would you give to those young people today,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.120
maybe in high school and college at Stanford,

01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:52.120
maybe to your grandchildren about how to have a career

01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.520
they can be proud of, have a life they can be proud of?

01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:58.600
Pursue careers that are in the public interest,

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.080
you know, in one fashion or another

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.360
and not just in their interests.

01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.560
And that would be, I mean,

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:08.040
it's not bad to pursue a career in your own interests.

01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:11.080
I mean, as long as it's something that's useful

01:58:11.080 --> 01:58:16.080
and positive for their families or whatever.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:20.040
But yeah, so I mean, I try to advise kids

01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.240
to find themselves somehow, you know,

01:58:22.240 --> 01:58:25.560
find who they wanna be and what they wanna be

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.280
and try to pursue it.

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.320
And the NGO world is growing, as you know,

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.320
and a lot of young people

01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:35.120
are kind of throwing themselves into it.

01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:40.440
And, you know, human rights watch and that kind of stuff.

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.480
And, you know, they wanna do that kind of work.

01:58:43.480 --> 01:58:45.480
And it's very admirable.

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:50.840
I tend to think that even if you're not working

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.280
in human rights, there's a certain way

01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:55.400
in which if you live with integrity,

01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:02.800
I believe that all of us or many of us

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:06.040
have a bunch of moments in our lives

01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:08.200
when we're posed with a decision.

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:09.520
It's a quiet one.

01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:12.560
Maybe it'll never be written about or talked about.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.800
Well, you get to choose whether you,

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:20.800
there's a choice that is difficult to make.

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.800
It may require a sacrifice,

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:27.360
but it's the choice that the best version

01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:29.000
of that person would make.

01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.640
That's the best way I can sort of say

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:32.760
how to act with integrity.

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.720
It's the very thing that would resist

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.400
the early days in Nazi Germany.

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:40.480
It sounds dramatic to say, but those little actions,

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.440
and I feel like the best you can do to avoid genocide

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:49.240
on scale is for all of us to live in that way,

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.920
within those moments,

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:55.520
unrelated potentially to human rights, to anything else,

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.440
is to take those actions.

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.440
Like, I believe that all of us know the right thing to do.

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:01.520
That's right.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:02.720
I think that's right.

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:04.040
You put it very well.

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:06.680
I couldn't have done it better myself.

02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:07.960
No, no, I agree.

02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:09.880
I agree completely that there are,

02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:14.000
to live with truth,

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.320
which is what Václav Havel used to say,

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.640
this famous Czech dissident,

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:21.120
talked about living in truth,

02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.080
but also to live with integrity.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.880
And that's really super important.

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:29.160
Well, let me ask you about love.

02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:31.320
What role does love play in this whole thing

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.280
in the human condition?

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:35.360
In all the study of genocide,

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:39.240
it does seem that hardship in moments

02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:41.280
brings out the best in human nature,

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:44.360
and the best in human nature is expressed through love.

02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.200
Well, as I already mentioned to you,

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:51.200
I think hardship is not a good thing.

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:54.000
It's not the best thing for love.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.720
I mean, it's better to not have to suffer

02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.200
and not have to. I think so.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:00.960
Yes, I think it is.

02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.520
I think it's, you know,

02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:06.520
as I mentioned to you,

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.680
studying concentration camps,

02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.480
this is not a place for love.

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.520
It happens,

02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:13.800
it happens,

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.280
but it's not really a place for love.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.680
It's a place for rape.

02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:19.360
It's a place for torture.

02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:20.480
It's a place for killing,

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:24.080
and it's a place for inhuman action,

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.200
one to another, you know?

02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:30.520
And also, as I said, among those who are suffering,

02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.120
not just between those who are,

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.840
and then there are whole gradations,

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:36.320
you know, the same thing in the gulag.

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.240
You know, there are gradations all the way

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:41.000
from the criminal prisoners

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.920
who beat the hell out of the political prisoners,

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.880
you know, who then have others below them

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.000
who they beat down, you know,

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.440
so everybody's being the hell out of everybody else.

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.440
So I would not idealize in any way suffering as, you know,

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.920
a source of beauty and love.

02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:57.240
A source of beauty and love.

02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.080
I wouldn't do that at all.

02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.720
I think it's a whole lot better

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:03.240
for people to be relatively prosperous.

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:04.840
I'm not saying super prosperous,

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:06.360
but to be able to feed themselves

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:08.240
and to be able to feed their families

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:09.840
and house their families

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.160
and take care of themselves,

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.000
you know, to foster

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.120
loving relations between people.

02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:25.400
And, you know, I think it's no accident that,

02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.520
you know, poor families have much,

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:33.240
you know, worse records when it comes to crime

02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.640
and things like that, you know,

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.800
and also to wife beating

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:40.840
and to child abuse and stuff like that.

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:43.600
I mean, you just, you don't want to be

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.720
poor and indigent and not have a roof over your head,

02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:49.560
be homeless.

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.440
It doesn't mean again, you know,

02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.320
homeless people are mean people.

02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:54.600
That's not what I'm trying to say.

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:56.960
What I'm trying to say is that, you know,

02:02:56.960 --> 02:02:59.080
what we want to try to foster in this country

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:00.840
and around the world.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.440
And one of the reasons, you know,

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:07.200
I mean, I'm very critical of the Chinese in a lot of ways,

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:08.320
but I mean, we have to remember,

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:11.080
they pulled that country out of horrible poverty, right?

02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:14.560
And I mean, there's still poor people on the countryside.

02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:16.640
There's still problems, you know,

02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:21.640
with want and need among the Chinese people.

02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:24.400
But, you know, there were millions and millions of Chinese

02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.520
who were living at the bare minimum of life,

02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.240
which is no way to live, you know,

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:30.520
and no way again to foster love

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:33.800
and compassion and getting along.

02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.200
So I want to be clear, I don't speak for history, right?

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.800
I'm giving you, I mean,

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:41.280
there used to be historians, you know,

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:43.000
in the 19th century who really thought

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.480
they were speaking for history, you know.

02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:47.040
I don't think that way at all.

02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:49.560
I mean, I understand I'm a subjective human being

02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:54.080
with my own points of view and my own opinions, but.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.160
I'm trying to remember this in this conversation

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.920
that you're, despite the fact that you're brilliant

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:00.680
and you've written brilliant books,

02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:02.640
that you're just human.

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:03.480
Well, I am.

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:04.320
With an opinion.

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.240
That's it.

02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:07.120
Yeah, no, no, that's absolutely true.

02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.720
And I tell my students that too.

02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:11.280
I mean, I make sure they understand

02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:12.960
this is not history speaking, you know,

02:04:12.960 --> 02:04:14.520
this is me and Norman.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:18.480
And I'm, you know, and this is what it's about.

02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:21.120
I mean, I spent a long time studying history

02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.960
and have enjoyed it enormously.

02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:29.480
But, you know, I'm an individual with my points of view.

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:33.040
And one of them is that I've developed over time

02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:39.120
is that, you know, human want is a real tragedy for people

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:41.960
and it hurts people.

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.240
And it also causes upheavals

02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:46.720
and difficulties and stuff like that.

02:04:46.720 --> 02:04:49.480
So I feel for people, you know, I feel for people in Syria.

02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:54.480
I feel for people in Ethiopia and Tigray, you know,

02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.280
when they don't have enough to eat.

02:04:56.280 --> 02:04:58.560
And, you know, what that does, I mean,

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.560
it doesn't mean they don't love each other, right?

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:03.080
And it doesn't mean they don't love their kids.

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:05.840
But it does mean that it's harder, you know,

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.720
to do that and to.

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:09.320
I'm not so sure.

02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:11.520
It's obvious to me that it's harder.

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:13.320
There is suffering, there is suffering.

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:16.600
But the numbers, we've been talking about deaths,

02:05:16.600 --> 02:05:17.840
been talking about suffering,

02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:20.040
but the numbers were not quantifying.

02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:22.760
The history that you haven't perhaps been looking at

02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:24.680
is all the times that people have fallen in love

02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:27.960
deeply with friends, with romantic love,

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:31.480
the positive emotion that people have felt.

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.360
And I'm not so sure that amidst the suffering,

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.720
those moments of beauty and love can be discovered.

02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:38.360
And if we look at the numbers,

02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:41.040
I'm not so sure the story is obvious.

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.720
That, you know, I mean, again,

02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:47.640
I suppose you may disagree with Viktor Frankl on A2,

02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:49.520
maybe depending on the day.

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:52.520
I mean, he says that if there's meaning to this life at all,

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.920
there's meaning to the suffering too,

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:56.240
because suffering is part of life.

02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:01.240
There's something about accepting the ups and downs,

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.840
even when the downs go very low.

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:07.760
And within all of it, finding a source of meaning.

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.880
I mean, he's arguing from the perspective of psychology,

02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:13.400
but just this life is an incredible gift,

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.400
almost no matter what.

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:20.400
And I'm not, it's easy to look at suffering

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:22.760
and think if we just escape the suffering,

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:27.420
it will all be better, but we all die.

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:30.360
There's beauty in the whole thing.

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:34.040
And it is true that it's just,

02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:35.360
from all the stories I've read,

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:39.360
especially in famine and starvation, it's just horrible.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:41.320
It is horrible suffering.

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:46.000
But I also just want to say that there's love amidst it,

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.360
and we can't forget that.

02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:49.040
No, no, I don't forget it.

02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:50.320
I don't forget it.

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.880
And I think it's from the stories.

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.800
Now, I don't want to make that compromise or that trade,

02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.640
but the intensity of friendship in war,

02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:04.560
the intensity of love in war is very high.

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.240
So I'm not sure what to make of these calculations,

02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.880
but if you look at the stories,

02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:10.440
some of the people I'm closest with,

02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.360
and I've never experienced anything

02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.280
even close to any of this,

02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:15.760
but some of the people I'm closest with

02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:18.320
is people I've gone through difficult times with.

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.040
There's something about that.

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:24.880
They're a society or a group where things are easy.

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:26.600
The intensity of the connection

02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:29.040
between human beings is not as strong.

02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:31.440
I don't know what to do with that calculus,

02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:32.800
because I too agree with you.

02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:37.600
I want to have as little suffering in the world as possible,

02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.400
but we have to remember about the love

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.000
and the depth of human connection

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.920
and find the right balance there.

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.840
No, there's something to what you're saying.

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:48.480
There's clearly something to what you're saying.

02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.720
I was just thinking about the Soviet Union

02:07:50.720 --> 02:07:53.480
when I lived there and people on the streets

02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:56.760
were so mean to one another and they never smiled.

02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:57.600
You grew up there?

02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:58.960
No, but you were, you're too young to-

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.880
No, no, I remember, well, I came here when I was 13, yeah.

02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:04.680
Okay, so anyway, I remember living there

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:07.120
and just how hard people were on each other on the streets.

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:09.040
And when you got inside people's apartments,

02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.280
when they started to trust you,

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:14.160
the friendships were so intense and so wonderful.

02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:19.760
So in that sense, I mean, they did live a hard life,

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:21.480
but there wasn't enough food on the table

02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.040
and there was a roof over their heads.

02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:24.080
There's a certain line.

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:26.040
There's a certain, there are lines.

02:08:26.040 --> 02:08:27.240
I don't think there's one line,

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:30.000
but it's kind of a shading.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.160
And the other story I was thinking of as you were talking

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:36.480
was, it's not a story, it's a history,

02:08:36.480 --> 02:08:40.240
a book by a friend of mine who wrote about love

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:45.240
in the camps, in the refugee camps

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.280
for Jews in Germany after the war.

02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:51.320
So these were Jews who had come mostly from Poland

02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:54.120
and were, you know, some survived the camps,

02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:56.200
came from awful circumstances.

02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:58.840
And then they were put in these camps,

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:00.880
which were not joyful places.

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:03.120
I mean, they were guarded sometimes by Germans even,

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:06.320
but they're basically under the British control.

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:07.880
And they were trying to get to Israel,

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:11.960
you know, trying to get to Palestine right after the war.

02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:16.080
And how many pairs there were, how many people coupled up.

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:18.720
But remember, this is after being in the concentration camp.

02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:20.600
It's not being in the concentration camp.

02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:25.600
And it's also being free, you know, to more or less free,

02:09:26.520 --> 02:09:28.200
you know, to express their emotions

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:33.000
and to be human beings after this horrible thing

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:34.400
which they suffered.

02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:36.920
So I wonder whether there's, you know, as you say,

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:39.560
some kind of calculus there where, you know,

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:44.560
the level of suffering is such that it's just too much

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.840
for humans to bear and, you know, which I would suggest.

02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.680
I mean, I haven't studied this myself.

02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:54.720
I'm just giving you my point of view, you know,

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.520
my off the cuff remarks here,

02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.040
but it was very inspiring to read about these couples

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.880
who had met right in these camps

02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:06.040
and started to couple up, you know, and get married

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:09.440
and try to find their way to Palestine,

02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:11.560
which was a difficult thing to do then.

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:14.480
When did you live in Russia and the Soviet Union?

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:16.120
What's your memory of that time?

02:10:16.120 --> 02:10:18.480
Well, so a number of different times.

02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:22.240
So I went there, I first went there in 69, 70.

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.760
Wow. A long time ago.

02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:28.760
And then I lived in Leningrad mostly

02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:31.640
but also in Moscow in 1975.

02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:33.720
So it was detente time,

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.520
but it was also a time of political uncertainty

02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:44.520
and also hardship, you know, for Russians themselves

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:46.080
and standing in long lines.

02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:48.040
I mean, you must remember this for food

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.840
and for getting anything was almost impossible.

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:55.440
It was a time when Jews were trying to get out.

02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.200
In fact, I just talked to a friend of mine

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:01.760
from those days who I helped get out and get to Boston

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:05.400
and the lovely people who managed to have a good life

02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.800
in the United States after they left.

02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.040
But it wasn't an easy time.

02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:11.760
It wasn't an easy time at all.

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:13.960
I remember people set fire to their doors

02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:17.960
and, you know, their daughter was persecuted in school,

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.480
you know, once they declared that they wanted to immigrate

02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:22.400
and that sort of thing.

02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.320
So it was a very, it was a lot of antisemitism.

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:30.000
So it was a tough time, dissonance, you know,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.360
hung out with some dissidents

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.200
and one guy was actually killed.

02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:38.560
We think by the, nobody knows exactly by the KGB

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:42.320
but his art studio was, he had a separate studio

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:46.400
in Leningrad, St. Petersburg today, you know,

02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:49.720
just a small studio where he did his art

02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.400
and somebody set it on fire.

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:54.440
And we think it was KGB, but you know, you never really know.

02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.880
And he died in that fire.

02:11:57.880 --> 02:12:01.440
So, you know, it was not a, it was a tough time.

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:04.640
And, you know, you knew you were followed,

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.560
you knew you were being reported on

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.880
as a foreign scholar as I was.

02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:11.080
There was a formal exchange

02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:13.440
between the United States and the Soviet Union.

02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:16.640
And, you know, they let me work in the archives,

02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.640
but then, you know, Ivanov got to work in the physics lab

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.440
at Rochester or something like that, you know.

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:29.200
So, it was an exchange which sent historians

02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:33.600
and literary people and some social scientists to Russia

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.800
and they sent all scientists here to, you know,

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:38.400
grab what they could from MIT and those places.

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.040
How's your Russian?

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:44.560
Has, do you have any knowledge of Russian language

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:46.320
that has helped you to understand?

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:47.520
Oh yeah, yeah.

02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:50.200
I mean, I can read it fine.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.960
And the speaking, you know, comes and goes,

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.680
depending on whether I'm there

02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:55.920
or whether I've been there recently

02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.520
or if I spend some time there,

02:12:57.520 --> 02:12:58.680
because I really need, you know,

02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:00.480
I have Russian friends who speak just Russian.

02:13:00.480 --> 02:13:04.320
So, you know, when I'm there, I then, you know,

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:05.800
I can communicate pretty well.

02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.120
I can't really write it, unfortunately.

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:11.920
I mean, I can, but it's not very good.

02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:14.000
But I get along fine in Russian.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
What's your fondest memory of the Soviet Union of Russia?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:18.840
It's friends.

02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:19.680
Friends.

02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:20.920
It's friends.

02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.360
Was it vodka involved?

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:24.680
Or is it just, is vodka involved?

02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.520
Is it?

02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:27.440
A little bit, you know, I'm not much of a drinker.

02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:29.640
So I would, you know, they'd just make fun of me

02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:32.040
and I'd make fun of myself.

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.000
That was easy enough.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.760
I don't really like, you know, a heavy drink.

02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:37.400
I've done a lot of that.

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:38.920
Not a lot, I'd done some of that,

02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:40.240
but I never really enjoyed it

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.640
and would get sick and stuff.

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:45.400
But no, it's friends.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:49.560
You know, one friend I made in the dormitory, you know,

02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.520
it was a dormitory for foreigners,

02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:56.280
but also Siberians who had come, you know,

02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.880
to Leningrad to study.

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.400
And so I met a couple of guys

02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:04.640
and one in particular from Omsk became a wonderful friend.

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.200
And we talked and talked and talked outside, you know,

02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:10.280
we would go walk outside because we both knew they were,

02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:12.080
you know, people were listening and stuff.

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:15.080
And he would say, well, this is, he was an historian,

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.880
you know, and so we would talk history.

02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:18.600
And he'd say, well, this was the case, wasn't it?

02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:21.160
I said, no, I'm sorry, Sasha, it wasn't the case.

02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:25.160
It was, you know, we think Stalin actually had a role

02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:27.360
in killing Kirov, I mean, we're not sure,

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:29.960
but he said, no, I said, yeah.

02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:32.160
You know, so, you know, we had these conversations

02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:37.160
and he was, I don't know if he would agree with me or not.

02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:39.240
I mean, we're still friends.

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:44.000
So he was a naive, maybe he'll listen to the blog

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:45.280
or I'll send it to him or something.

02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:48.200
He was a kind of naive Marxist-Leninist.

02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.280
And he thought I was, you know, I was, you know,

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:52.840
I had this capitalist ideology.

02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.320
He'd say, what ideology you have?

02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:56.680
And I said, I don't have an ideology, you know,

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.760
I try to just put together kind of reason and facts

02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:03.880
and accurate stories and try to tell them in that way.

02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.520
No, no, no, no, you must, you know,

02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.560
you're a bourgeois, you know, this or that.

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.160
I said, no, I'm really not.

02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:12.480
And so we would have these talks and these kinds

02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.760
of arguments and then, I mean, sure enough, you know,

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:19.240
we corresponded for a while

02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:20.960
and then he had to stop corresponding

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:25.640
because he became a kind of local official in Omsk.

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:29.560
And he sort of migrated more and more to being a Democrat.

02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.760
And he was then in the, you know, democratic movement

02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:37.120
under Gorbachev and, you know,

02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:39.360
and the council of people's deputies, which they set up,

02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:44.360
which was, you know, elected as a Democrat from Omsk

02:15:45.200 --> 02:15:49.480
and had a political career through the Eltsin period.

02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:52.800
And once Putin came along, you know, it was over.

02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:56.160
He didn't like Putin and, you know,

02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:59.160
and Putin didn't like the Eltsin people, right?

02:15:59.160 --> 02:16:02.640
Who were, tried to be, some of them tried to be Democrats.

02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:04.200
And Sasha was one who really did.

02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:06.600
He just published his memoirs in Russian, by the way,

02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:08.040
which are very good, I think.

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:08.880
Good afternoon.

02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:13.880
Um, Commanderovka for the last, that's what it's called.

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:18.040
It was hard, it's hard to translate in English.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:19.480
Commanderovka for the last.

02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:22.040
But I mean, I translated it full-point-once form.

02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:23.040
This is so beautiful.

02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:26.560
Like the, do you find that the translation is a problem

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:27.400
or no?

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:28.400
It's such a different language.

02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:30.160
Yes, translation is very difficult.

02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:31.080
With the Russian language.

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:33.880
I mean, it's the only language I know deeply,

02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:35.640
except English.

02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.800
And it seems like so much is lost of the pain

02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:40.720
and the poetry, the beauty of the people is.

02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.200
And translators are to be treasured and good ones to be,

02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:47.800
I mean, those who do the translations, you know,

02:16:47.800 --> 02:16:50.640
when you read, you know, things in translation,

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:52.120
sometimes they're quite beautiful, you know,

02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.040
whether it's Russian or Polish or German

02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.400
or anything French.

02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.600
Yeah, I'm actually traveling to Paris

02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.800
to talk to the famous translators,

02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.280
the Dostoevsky, Tolstoy.

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.600
And I'm just going to do several conversations with them

02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:07.320
about like, you can just sometimes just grab a single

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.480
sentence and just talk about the translation in that sense.

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:14.800
That's, and also, as you said,

02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:16.160
I would love to be a fly in the wall

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:17.560
with some of those friends that you had,

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:20.440
because the perspective on history,

02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.440
non-academic sort of without just as human beings

02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:28.360
is so different from the United States versus Russia.

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.600
When you talk about the way the World War II is perceived

02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:34.560
and all those kinds of things, it's fascinating.

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:39.520
History also has in it opinion and perspective.

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:41.880
And so sometimes tripping that away is really difficult.

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:43.080
And then I guess that is your job.

02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.560
And at its highest form, that is what you do as a historian.

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:48.680
Well, Norman,

02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.680
I really appreciate your valuable time.

02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:56.040
It's truly an honor to talk to you

02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:00.280
and thank you for taking us through a trip

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.760
through some of the worst parts of human history

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.360
and talking about hope and love at the end.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:08.080
So I really appreciate your time today.

02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:08.920
Okay, thank you.

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:09.760
Thank you.

02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:11.360
Thank you for having me.

02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.840
Thanks for listening to this conversation

02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:14.280
with Norman Namark.

02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:15.520

And now let me leave you with some words from Stalin.

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:23.760
A single death is a tragedy.

02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:26.240
A million deaths is a statistic.

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:30.480
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:18:32.760 --> 02:18:33.600
Thank you.
