00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
You always know when you live in Gaza that it's only a matter of

00:02.760 --> 00:06.000
time before the next bombs drop.

00:06.320 --> 00:12.240
You know, if you're in Gaza, that you are waiting for your death.

00:13.440 --> 00:18.200
People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.600
People dream about going out in the world and pursuing

00:20.600 --> 00:22.360
economic opportunity in Gaza.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.920
Your idea of opportunity is an opportunity to see the next year.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.960
That has been the case.

00:29.480 --> 00:34.160
And so when we talk about, you know, this not existing in a vacuum,

00:34.880 --> 00:41.720
if people only hear about Gaza on October 7th, that is, that is

00:41.720 --> 00:42.920
a major part of the problem.

00:43.240 --> 00:48.720
And that is again, part of the problem of our ignorance and our apathy, right?

00:48.760 --> 00:55.280
Why is it that the plight of the people of Gaza is not brought up until

00:55.560 --> 00:56.840
an attack happens on Israel?

00:59.200 --> 01:01.720
The following is a conversation with Imam Dr.

01:01.720 --> 01:04.600
Omar Suleiman, his second time on the podcast.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.600
He is a Palestinian American, a Muslim scholar, a civil rights leader,

01:11.000 --> 01:15.240
president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research, and is one of the

01:15.240 --> 01:17.560
most influential Muslims in the world.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.800
Our previous conversation was focused on Islam.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.320
This time, the focus was on Gaza and Palestine.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.120
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:28.360 --> 01:31.200
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:31.520 --> 01:35.040
And now dear friends, here's Omar Suleiman.

01:36.280 --> 01:42.160
What did you think, feel, and pray for in the days that followed October 7th?

01:43.280 --> 01:50.600
I think the first feeling was that there's going to be a lot of death

01:50.600 --> 01:53.240
and destruction in Gaza as a result, right?

01:53.240 --> 01:58.960
We always kind of see this where one Israeli casualty leads to

01:58.960 --> 02:01.160
hundreds of Palestinian casualties, right?

02:01.160 --> 02:08.720
So it's a pretty familiar cycle in some ways where there are daily transgressions

02:08.720 --> 02:14.720
against Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza, the checkpoints, the

02:14.800 --> 02:21.200
aggression on Masjid al-Aqsa, the settlements expanding, the stories

02:21.560 --> 02:27.360
of Palestinian death, and then you have rockets fired from Gaza.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.040
And that's when the Western press catches up and starts to cover it.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.600
Israel responds with hellfire missiles, white phosphorus bombs, and the

02:36.600 --> 02:39.560
casualties are wildly disproportionate.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.880
And so I think that, you know, I wasn't surprised.

02:44.520 --> 02:50.360
I prayed for the people that I knew were going to bear the brunt of this

02:50.360 --> 02:52.600
outbreak, but the outbreak was predictable.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.640
You wrote a statement on October 9th.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.120
I was hoping to read it, if it's okay.

03:01.160 --> 03:01.640
Yeah, go ahead.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.680
Our Palestinian casualties are always your footnotes.

03:06.280 --> 03:10.800
The daily humiliation of occupation ignored, the aggression by settlers

03:10.800 --> 03:15.960
and soldiers alike on holy sites and souls, the annihilation of entire

03:16.000 --> 03:20.440
families that follows, the devastation of whatever scraps remain in the

03:20.440 --> 03:24.840
open air prison of Gaza, unsustainable and inhumane.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.200
So if you're waking up to a sudden interest in the region to want to

03:29.200 --> 03:33.760
know what's been happening, dig a bit deeper than two weeks and try to read

03:33.760 --> 03:38.560
beyond the headlines of a media that has been dehumanizing us for decades.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.520
Again, this was not surprising.

03:41.760 --> 03:43.680
This was very predictable.

03:43.720 --> 03:49.920
If you've been watching what's been unfolding before October 7th, 2021,

03:50.600 --> 03:55.440
human rights watch puts out the report threshold reached.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.520
Israel is an apartheid state.

03:58.320 --> 04:04.640
Amnesty international 2022, the crime of apartheid, showing how all of the

04:04.640 --> 04:09.240
legal determinations of apartheid have been reached, the occupation is

04:09.240 --> 04:10.440
only getting more aggressive.

04:10.680 --> 04:14.160
Shireen Abu Akhla, a Palestinian American journalist is shot dead in

04:14.160 --> 04:16.800
2022 in front of the world.

04:17.320 --> 04:24.400
The United States says initially that if it is shown that Israel was complicit

04:24.400 --> 04:28.480
or that Israel carried out the execution, then there will be consequences.

04:29.360 --> 04:34.080
Of course, once it was shown that Israel was indeed responsible for the

04:34.080 --> 04:37.400
bullet that killed Shireen Abu Akhla, the United States did absolutely nothing.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.880
Shireen's funeral was attacked.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.440
The power bearers were beaten.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.040
Her casket almost fell.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.040
And again, the world is watching.

04:46.760 --> 04:52.000
The aggression against worshipers in Al-Aqsa is getting worse.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.480
You have the flag march, the Jerusalem flag march where extremist settlers are

04:58.120 --> 05:03.600
let loose and wild on Palestinians by the thousands chanting things like

05:03.600 --> 05:08.840
Mohammed is dead, we're going to murder you Arabs, all with the protection of

05:08.840 --> 05:10.520
the state with Israeli soldiers.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.040
And throughout this time, it's like something bad is going to happen.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.080
And then 2023 comes along.

05:18.480 --> 05:27.720
You had 13,000 settler units in 2023, a plan of 13,000 settler units, the most

05:28.600 --> 05:33.680
in the history of the occupation, the most racist and extremist government,

05:33.680 --> 05:35.560
Israeli government that you have ever had.

05:36.720 --> 05:41.800
And people don't realize that in 2023 alone, over 600 Palestinians had already

05:41.800 --> 05:44.880
been killed, it just doesn't make Western headlines.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.240
And so if you wonder why the American public sees this so much differently

05:51.240 --> 05:56.320
than the rest of the world, it's because American media shows the American

05:56.320 --> 06:00.000
public something so much different than what the rest of the world has shown.

06:00.720 --> 06:03.280
And so this was a pressure cooker.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.640
This was going to explode.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.960
It is extremely predictable.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.240
You've given people absolutely no hope.

06:12.720 --> 06:18.640
And so I think that as we're watching that, it's important for us to actually

06:18.640 --> 06:26.160
interrogate the ignorance that people have of the Palestinian plight, the

06:26.160 --> 06:32.000
ignorance of the root causes of this violence, the ignorance of the occupation.

06:33.080 --> 06:41.480
And also ask yourselves, why is it that Israel can violate every single

06:41.600 --> 06:47.160
international law on the books, have all these determinations and the United

06:47.160 --> 06:51.600
States keeps on issuing these inconsequential statements while also at

06:51.600 --> 06:54.440
the same time, funding these aggressions.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.000
So it's like, stop the settler violence.

06:57.360 --> 07:00.680
The United States will issue statement after statement, stop the settler violence,

07:01.520 --> 07:06.680
stop the incursions on Masjid al-Aqsa, stop violating the people in Jerusalem,

07:06.680 --> 07:12.400
stop trying to wipe out the Palestinian people, stop openly saying that there is

07:12.400 --> 07:16.280
no two-state solution, that we will never allow a Palestinian state to be established.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.040
But at the same time, here's your $3 billion check.

07:20.880 --> 07:28.120
And if the United Nations issues any sort of resolution against Israel, or if any

07:28.120 --> 07:32.720
international body tries to hold Israel accountable, the United States stands

07:32.720 --> 07:34.520
in the way of any accountability.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.240
It's important for us to ask why.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.560
And so I always tell people, read beyond the headlines.

07:39.600 --> 07:45.440
Even now, with the backdrop of a genocide, over 30,000 people have been killed.

07:46.160 --> 07:50.520
If you open the front page of most American mainstream sites, you will see

07:50.520 --> 07:54.440
stories about the hostages, the Israeli hostages, you will see stories about

07:54.440 --> 07:59.280
October 7th, but October 8th is missing, October 9th is missing, October 10th is

07:59.280 --> 08:04.800
missing, a hundred days of genocide are missing, and you'll barely have a story

08:04.800 --> 08:11.240
that shows up every once in a while that is still very much so controlled by the

08:11.240 --> 08:14.840
Israeli propaganda machine, because while Israel kills Palestinian journalists,

08:15.520 --> 08:20.760
it also makes sure that American journalists are only able to tell a certain story.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.640
They're only able to see Gaza from a certain perspective.

08:24.040 --> 08:28.160
They're only able to speak about Gaza from a certain perspective.

08:28.800 --> 08:35.080
And this is well-documented that they have to review their media tapes with

08:35.080 --> 08:37.280
Israel before they can publicize them.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.280
And so this is state propaganda at this point.

08:41.080 --> 08:45.200
The mainstream media and the United States government are in lockstep

08:45.200 --> 08:47.720
telling a very skewed story.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.280
And that is leading to a greater sense of frustration.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.560
And I think the American public has been wronged as well by

08:54.560 --> 08:55.680
not knowing what's happening.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.400
So you mentioned settlements.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.240
So to you, this is bigger than Gaza.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.480
It is the West Bank.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.640
It is the Palestinian people broadly.

09:05.160 --> 09:05.840
Absolutely.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.720
You can't disconnect Gaza from Palestine.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.560
You can't disconnect the West Bank from Palestine.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.080
You can't disconnect Jerusalem from Palestine.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.880
And you can't disconnect the very human story from the political plight.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.320
You interviewed Mohammed Al-Qurd, met him.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.600
What did the world do when it saw the images of the Qurd household being taken

09:27.600 --> 09:33.680
over by a guy from Brooklyn or Long Island who just shows up and lays claim to their home?

09:34.200 --> 09:41.600
What did the world do when American settlers suddenly decided they could walk

09:41.600 --> 09:45.360
into historic Palestinian homes and throw people out of their homes?

09:45.760 --> 09:47.280
What did the world do?

09:47.480 --> 09:52.960
And so, yes, this is very much so connected to the broader

09:52.960 --> 09:55.120
issue of Palestinian existence.

09:55.680 --> 09:59.120
If you realize here, we are erased in peace and we are erased in war.

09:59.680 --> 10:05.120
In peace, it's the Abraham Accords, agreements between Israel and its Arab

10:05.120 --> 10:09.200
neighbors, which is supposedly to solve the Palestinian problem.

10:09.560 --> 10:14.560
The Palestinians are absent from their own fate, from discussions about their own fate.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.960
In war, it's the Israel-Hamas war.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.800
It's Israel and Gaza.

10:19.560 --> 10:26.440
Where are the Palestinian people, the millions of Palestinian people that have either been

10:26.440 --> 10:29.880
removed from their land or are being tormented on their land?

10:29.920 --> 10:31.520
Where are they in this discussion?

10:32.240 --> 10:36.640
What are the Palestinians in the diaspora feeling?

10:37.600 --> 10:44.240
I think deeply frustrated, a great sense of anger, sadness.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.720
Every single Palestinian right now knows someone that's been killed.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.160
Every single Palestinian is a part of a story of displacement or destruction.

10:54.640 --> 11:00.480
Every single Palestinian has a relative that's either missing a limb or a loved one.

11:00.960 --> 11:06.240
Every single Palestinian in the world is traumatized by this.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.520
And in some ways, being outside of Palestine, being away from it all, hurts even more.

11:14.240 --> 11:20.960
Because you see your people being killed and starved and brutalized and slaughtered,

11:21.360 --> 11:22.800
and you can't do anything about it.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.320
And the people around you are justifying that slaughter.

11:27.120 --> 11:33.760
If you turn on a TV or if you open a mainstream news site, these sites are justifying your

11:34.320 --> 11:34.800
slaughter.

11:35.440 --> 11:40.080
And people are being killed over there because they look like me, because they're Palestinian

11:40.080 --> 11:41.520
like I'm Palestinian.

11:41.520 --> 11:45.520
And so we're watching this in diaspora with agony.

11:45.520 --> 11:51.040
We can't go, we can't heal our loved ones, we can't comfort the people that are there.

11:52.080 --> 11:59.280
I recently spoke to a doctor who's lost 75 relatives, 75 relatives in Gaza.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.120
And he's a medical doctor.

12:02.080 --> 12:07.520
And all he wants to do is get in there and just use his medical expertise to help his

12:07.520 --> 12:08.000
people.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.720
And he can't.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.160
And so we're watching it from afar, but our hearts are there.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.640
They are in the buildings that are being destroyed.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.800
They're in the hospitals that are being bombed.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.520
They are there and they are with the people.

12:22.640 --> 12:28.080
You're somebody who's always rushed into the midst of a crisis.

12:29.040 --> 12:34.400
So what does it feel like on a personal level to not be able to do that here, to go to Gaza,

12:34.400 --> 12:34.880
to help?

12:36.960 --> 12:40.400
Yeah, it's really hard.

12:40.400 --> 12:48.880
I mean, when any group of people are killed, my instinct and I think a lot of people is

12:48.880 --> 12:54.720
to go there to help, whether it's a natural disaster or especially after an incident of

12:54.800 --> 12:58.480
terror, wherever it is, right?

12:58.480 --> 13:03.280
It's rush there and do the best that you can to help people get through it.

13:05.280 --> 13:11.520
So it's been extremely hard to watch this from afar and feel like I can't do anything

13:11.520 --> 13:11.920
about it.

13:11.920 --> 13:17.920
And so that's why instead I think that most of us are driven to continue to be the voice

13:17.920 --> 13:18.960
of the voiceless.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.200
I always say that if they've made them faceless, they can't make us voiceless.

13:24.160 --> 13:30.320
They have reduced our casualties in Palestine to a number.

13:30.960 --> 13:37.760
The number is hundreds a day, over 30,000 people.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.000
We're averaging 10,000 people a month.

13:40.640 --> 13:47.200
The fact that they've been turned into faceless numbers with no stories, with no humanity,

13:47.760 --> 13:50.480
makes it that much more important for us to tell their stories here

13:51.120 --> 13:55.920
and to remind the world that you've lost your humanity if you can watch this unfold and not

13:55.920 --> 13:58.480
even have the decency to call for a ceasefire.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.680
That's where we've reached.

14:01.680 --> 14:02.960
That's how low it is right now.

14:02.960 --> 14:06.240
Calling for a ceasefire has now become radical.

14:07.200 --> 14:16.560
So we have to remind the world that if you're okay with the demolition of an entire town

14:17.200 --> 14:21.280
or a city or whatever it is that you want to call Gaza because it wasn't always the Gaza strip.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.600
But if you're okay with this and you're okay with this casualty count every single day,

14:26.880 --> 14:29.200
it's not just them who are being killed.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.800
It's your hearts that are dying.

14:30.800 --> 14:35.200
And I think that when I look back to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and I mentioned this,

14:35.200 --> 14:36.240
he wrote about Vietnam.

14:36.240 --> 14:43.360
He said that if America was to succumb to its spiritual death, the autopsy would read Vietnam.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.960
I would say that it would read Gaza now.

14:47.040 --> 14:54.240
And speaking of the people, the faces, the voices, one of the people you've talked about,

14:54.800 --> 14:59.760
you've posted about, you've written about is Wael Al-Dahduh and being hospitalized.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.560
He's a Palestinian journalist and bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Gaza City.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.960
What can you tell me about this man?

15:06.960 --> 15:11.440
If Wael Al-Dahduh wasn't Palestinian, he'd be on the cover of Time magazine right now.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.080
He would be the most celebrated journalist in the world.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.160
Wael Al-Dahduh is from Gaza.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.160
He has been in Israeli prisons.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.280
He has been under Israeli airstrikes.

15:24.080 --> 15:28.320
He has seen the worst of the occupation before he's seen the worst of the genocide

15:29.280 --> 15:30.320
while on TV.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.920
I mean, and this is insane when you think about it.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.640
We have over a hundred journalists now, right?

15:36.640 --> 15:40.960
That's more than any conflict in history that have been killed.

15:40.960 --> 15:46.080
And there is sufficient evidence by international watchdogs that this is intentional,

15:46.080 --> 15:48.160
that journalists have been killed intentionally.

15:48.880 --> 15:54.320
But then their families, Wael was reporting on TV when an airstrike hits his wife,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.440
two kids, and a grandchild.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.720
He goes to the scene and he said this, you know,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.760
you never expect as a journalist to be the subject of the story.

16:06.720 --> 16:13.440
Suddenly the camera is on him mourning over his dead wife and kids and grandkid.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.800
And he's saying, he even says in Arabic, he says, they're taking it out on our children.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.960
They're taking it out on our children.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.960
You know, I've heard this from multiple people that have had relatives targeted

16:26.960 --> 16:28.320
that I wish it was me instead.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.560
He gets back on camera the same day because he feels a responsibility to

16:34.560 --> 16:37.200
continue to cover the lives of the people of Gaza.

16:37.200 --> 16:41.920
He understands that his story, as devastating as it is,

16:42.960 --> 16:46.560
is not unique in regards to the people of Gaza,

16:46.560 --> 16:49.440
that there are many people whose families have been killed in airstrikes.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.440
All 2 million people have been traumatized in some way.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.280
And so he gets back on camera, tells the story again.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.080
And then he is targeted himself.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.240
His arm is struck.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.920
His cameraman, Samar Abu Dhaka, dies in front of him.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.800
He bleeds out.

17:10.800 --> 17:14.320
Wael watches him bleed out for hours.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.640
And while any aid workers try to reach them in the building that they were in,

17:19.840 --> 17:24.080
snipers would shoot all of those that were rushing to Samar.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.520
So he watches his cameraman and one of his best friends bleed out to death.

17:27.520 --> 17:31.520
Wael goes to the hospital, his arm is wrapped up, gets treatment.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.600
He's back on camera the next day.

17:35.040 --> 17:45.360
A few weeks later, another child is killed again with his friend in a car.

17:45.360 --> 17:46.880
So this was a targeted airstrike.

17:46.880 --> 17:52.560
His son is driving and his son and his best friend are hit in an airstrike.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.560
Wael leads the funeral prayer, is back on camera again

17:57.280 --> 18:00.320
and speaks with such dignity, with such compassion.

18:01.280 --> 18:07.760
One of the things that always gets to me as a Palestinian and as a Muslim too,

18:09.040 --> 18:12.240
is that we are portrayed to be these beasts and savages.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.440
Tell me a man that would be put through what Wael was put through

18:16.480 --> 18:23.120
and still stand on that pulpit and in front of the world with such dignity, with such grace,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.360
continues to tell the story.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.800
Wael has become a hero to many of us.

18:28.800 --> 18:35.440
And he would be a hero in a world that wasn't anti-Palestinian.

18:36.320 --> 18:42.240
And unfortunately, Wael has not only lost his family,

18:43.040 --> 18:47.200
he's not only lost much of his own existence,

18:47.840 --> 18:50.400
but Wael is part of the greater story of erasure.

18:50.400 --> 18:54.560
So even though he's telling the story of the people of Gaza and he is the story of the people

18:54.560 --> 18:58.080
of Gaza, most people will never learn about Wael.

19:01.360 --> 19:06.000
You have posted videos and written about what is happening in Gaza since October 7th.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.640
What has been happening there?

19:08.640 --> 19:12.880
The individual stories and the broader impact on the two million people there?

19:12.880 --> 19:16.080
Gaza has been described as the world's largest open air prison,

19:16.720 --> 19:19.840
unemployment, blockaded from all directions, no airport,

19:20.320 --> 19:26.880
regular added restrictions placed even on their ability to fish.

19:27.840 --> 19:34.480
So every aspect of Gaza's life has been under occupation.

19:34.480 --> 19:38.160
I would argue that it's an injustice to even call it an open air prison

19:38.880 --> 19:46.240
because inmates are not bombed in prisons routinely by the most sophisticated weapons in the world.

19:46.800 --> 19:54.080
Regular bombardment of Gaza, every single person in Gaza has lived through

19:54.080 --> 19:55.840
multiple rounds of bombardment.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.480
It is deeply distressing.

20:01.920 --> 20:08.480
I remember in 2021, there was an image that I will never forget

20:09.360 --> 20:14.080
of children having to go back to school after the bombardment of 2021.

20:15.040 --> 20:20.320
And next to them, they would have the empty chairs and the posters

20:21.120 --> 20:22.880
of the child that used to sit in that chair.

20:24.240 --> 20:29.920
I think what encapsulates it most for me, an image that I grew up with was the image of Mohamed

20:29.920 --> 20:35.680
al-Durrah, who was in his father's lap over 20 years ago.

20:36.320 --> 20:40.240
And his father was begging for Israel to spare his child.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.880
And Mohamed was murdered in his lap.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.480
And you know what happened this last round?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.680
His other kids were murdered.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.320
So Mohamed's brothers were murdered and his father's been on the run.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.560
Every single person in Gaza has witnessed multiple wars,

20:56.560 --> 21:00.640
has witnessed the greatest suffocation of occupation,

21:01.760 --> 21:07.280
has even had their diets restricted and has suffered under Israel state policy,

21:07.280 --> 21:08.640
which is called mowing the lawn.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.800
And everyone should look this up.

21:10.800 --> 21:17.600
This is what Israeli ministers refer to as routine bombardment of Gaza, mowing the lawn,

21:18.800 --> 21:22.320
which shows you that before they called us animals, they considered us insects.

21:23.600 --> 21:26.960
And unfortunately, the casualty counts get higher and higher every time

21:27.840 --> 21:30.560
and people become more and more desperate, more and more helpless.

21:31.520 --> 21:40.560
Gaza has been unfortunately the worst manifestation of anti-Palestinian bigotry.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.840
60% of the population is a refugee population.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.080
What that means, and people do need to understand this,

21:46.080 --> 21:52.320
is that people move to Gaza from other parts of occupied territory to find refuge.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.840
And we're practically living on top of each other.

21:57.280 --> 22:03.120
There are people that are in the Gaza Strip that know that they had homes

22:03.120 --> 22:04.640
right beyond that apartheid wall.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.040
And those homes were stolen from them and they can't even enter that territory anymore.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.880
And they know that on the other side of that wall, there's life.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.360
On the other side of that wall, there's opportunity.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.880
On the other side of that wall, you have a passport, you have an airport,

22:18.880 --> 22:23.760
you have the ability to travel, you have the ability to export and import.

22:23.760 --> 22:31.040
You can dream, but behind that wall, you are to live until the next airstrike.

22:31.040 --> 22:35.680
You are to live until Israel mows the lawn again and hope that you're not part of the grass.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.680
That's what Gaza has been all of these years.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.760
So pragmatically and psychologically, it is very difficult to flourish

22:43.040 --> 22:45.520
when you're just waiting for more bombardment.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.360
Because you know that it's around the corner.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.400
You always know when you live in Gaza that it's only a matter of time

22:51.440 --> 22:53.680
before the next bombs drop.

22:53.680 --> 22:59.440
You know if you're in Gaza that you are waiting for your death.

23:00.720 --> 23:05.520
People dream about going out in the world and pursuing education.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.680
People dream about going out in the world and pursuing economic opportunity in Gaza.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.240
Your idea of opportunity is an opportunity to see the next year.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.160
That has been the case.

23:16.800 --> 23:21.440
And so when we talk about this not existing in a vacuum,

23:22.240 --> 23:30.560
if people only hear about Gaza on October 7th, that is a major part of the problem.

23:30.560 --> 23:35.120
And that is again part of the problem of our ignorance and our apathy.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.640
Why is it that the plight of the people of Gaza

23:39.600 --> 23:44.240
is not brought up until an attack happens on Israel?

23:45.520 --> 23:50.720
I've gotten a chance to witness a destroyed school in Ukraine.

23:53.040 --> 23:57.600
That's something that is really difficult to see.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.480
You have over a hundred destroyed mosques.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.160
Every university in Gaza has been demolished.

24:04.160 --> 24:12.880
We're seeing TikTok videos of Israeli soldiers laughing and singing as they press a button

24:12.880 --> 24:17.200
and we see the demolition of every single university in Gaza.

24:17.200 --> 24:19.120
Schools have been reduced to rubble.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.600
There's a cultural genocide as well.

24:22.160 --> 24:24.480
I want you to think about what you saw in Ukraine.

24:24.480 --> 24:29.680
Look, imagine coming back to school in Gaza in some destroyed building.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.600
You're missing legs.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.560
You're missing arms.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.880
You have white phosphorus burns.

24:34.880 --> 24:37.280
Have you ever seen what white phosphorus does to a person?

24:37.280 --> 24:38.880
There's a reason why it's a war crime.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.960
You have white phosphorus burns.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.680
Your mom's dead.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.480
Your dad's dead.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.920
All of your uncles and aunts are dead.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.200
All of your siblings are dead.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.880
Somehow you got pulled out of the rubble.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.920
In my own family, my father is in-laws.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.240
My father remarried after my mother passed away.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.080
And they're in Gaza.

24:56.320 --> 25:03.440
All of them were killed in an airstrike, except for an elderly aunt who somehow made it out of

25:03.440 --> 25:04.720
the rubble a day later.

25:04.720 --> 25:09.200
If you're a child that's been pulled out of the rubble, what are you going to grow up with?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.760
I mean, what are you supposed to feel?

25:12.400 --> 25:14.000
What are you supposed to think?

25:15.040 --> 25:22.400
And then you have racist commentators that say they could have turned that into a Singapore.

25:22.880 --> 25:28.720
The Palestinians are the authors of their own destruction because if they wanted to,

25:28.720 --> 25:31.760
they could have turned this into a place of prosperity.

25:32.720 --> 25:36.320
But they keep on bringing destruction upon themselves.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.200
So at the root of this is a bigotry.

25:39.200 --> 25:44.560
And again, this idea that Palestinians are savages, they're animals, and the only way

25:44.560 --> 25:49.760
to deal with them is to continuously mow the lawn while simultaneously expanding the occupation

25:49.760 --> 25:54.640
and erasing anything that was ever called Palestine and any human being that was ever

25:54.640 --> 25:55.680
called a Palestinian.

25:57.840 --> 26:04.640
So those kids growing up in Gaza now, to you, they have almost no choice but to have hatred

26:05.760 --> 26:06.800
for Israel?

26:07.840 --> 26:08.880
It's human.

26:09.760 --> 26:17.280
I mean, look, any child that is under that type of oppression is going to hate their

26:17.280 --> 26:18.080
oppressor.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.040
I don't care who you are.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.000
I don't care what you are.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.040
But here's my problem with how that gets brought up.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.960
You're talking about the future of the security of Israel.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.920
Even some people that speak about it, seemingly from a place of being well-meaning, that say

26:33.920 --> 26:38.320
the only way that Israel can have its security is to stop killing Palestinians.

26:38.320 --> 26:43.600
And so the future of Israel depends upon Palestinians not hating Israel so much.

26:43.600 --> 26:47.920
And so we've got to stop tormenting these people so that we can stop killing

26:48.240 --> 26:49.840
they don't grow up to want to torment us.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.920
You've already decided then whose life is worth more than the other.

26:54.640 --> 27:00.880
And so instead of talking about the future of Israeli lives, why don't you talk about

27:00.880 --> 27:02.480
the present of Palestinian lives?

27:02.480 --> 27:06.400
Instead of talking about whether or not your state will be secure in the future,

27:07.600 --> 27:11.520
talk to me about why you're killing children now.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.480
Two-thirds of the 30,000 civilians are women and children.

27:17.360 --> 27:21.600
And so we can't talk about what these children are going to grow up with.

27:22.320 --> 27:25.680
We should talk about whether or not these children are going to grow up in the first place.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.520
And that should be what dominates our conscience right now.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.160
And what drives our policies and what drives our emotions right now.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.680
When I had a conversation with Elon Musk, he suggested

27:38.960 --> 27:42.320
that what Israel should do is conspicuous acts of kindness.

27:43.280 --> 27:52.560
So do as much positive things in Gaza as possible on a basic individual human level

27:52.560 --> 27:54.400
and on a policy level at every level.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.080
What do you think about that?

27:56.080 --> 27:58.560
I mean, you don't pass out candy in a concentration camp.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.960
You end the occupation.

28:01.920 --> 28:07.520
And so there has to be a solution that is beyond merely acts of kindness.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.520
At the end of the day, if you're occupying a people,

28:09.520 --> 28:11.520
you have to remove that occupation.

28:12.160 --> 28:18.960
Apartheid is not dealt with by acts of kindness on the part of the occupying power.

28:19.600 --> 28:22.800
Apartheid is dealt with by ending apartheid.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.280
And so there has to be a level of accountability.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.480
It's not just acts of kindness.

28:26.480 --> 28:32.080
It's not just treating the people with more dignity.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.560
It's giving them the ability to pursue their own dignity.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.880
There's a reason why it's called Palestinian self-determination.

28:37.840 --> 28:41.360
The United States likes to use it in all of its inconsequential statements

28:41.360 --> 28:43.920
that we need Palestinian self-determination too.

28:43.920 --> 28:48.720
But the United States also voted against 138 states in the United Nations

28:48.720 --> 28:51.280
to allow for Palestinian self-determination.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.800
Self-determination means I get to pursue my own course of worth.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.400
I get to pursue my own happiness.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.640
I don't have to depend on the benevolence of my occupier.

29:02.960 --> 29:08.720
When my occupier feels like throwing me a few more crumbs, it has to end.

29:08.720 --> 29:13.600
There has to be a point now where the world says this is not sustainable.

29:13.600 --> 29:16.720
It's not just about ending the present genocide.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.240
A ceasefire is the bare minimum.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.800
I think any decent human being would be calling for a ceasefire right now,

29:22.800 --> 29:24.560
but at some point you cease occupation.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.200
You cease apartheid because what led to the ability

29:27.840 --> 29:31.360
of Israel to carry out a genocide without any accountability

29:32.320 --> 29:35.840
was that the global arena has permitted it to do so,

29:35.840 --> 29:38.640
largely due to American obstruction of justice.

29:39.760 --> 29:44.400
Is violence an effective method of resistance?

29:45.120 --> 29:50.080
So the framework that I would propose is that

29:52.960 --> 29:59.040
Dr. King mentioned that peace is not the absence of violence.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.400
It's the presence of justice.

30:02.240 --> 30:08.240
And so occupation and apartheid are violent even in their most benevolent manifestations.

30:10.080 --> 30:14.000
The default of occupation is that it is unjustified.

30:14.000 --> 30:18.480
The default of apartheid is that it is unjustified and it must be dealt with.

30:19.440 --> 30:24.720
The default of resistance to occupation and apartheid is that it is justified,

30:25.360 --> 30:30.400
but there can be transgressions even resisting occupation and apartheid, right?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.400
And I come to this from an Islamic perspective.

30:33.200 --> 30:34.800
My moral framework is Islam.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.920
The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was outraged when he saw

30:41.280 --> 30:45.920
a woman or a child that was dead from the other side, the side of his persecutors.

30:46.720 --> 30:52.560
And so, yes, we have a saying as Muslims that they are not our teachers.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.360
Our oppressors are not our teachers.

30:56.080 --> 31:01.680
But the concept of resistance to occupation, it is morally justified.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.000
It is justified by international law.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.840
Any occupied people have the right to defend themselves.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.080
We talk about Israel's right to defend itself.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.360
Israel is the occupier.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.960
Any occupied people by international law have the right to defend themselves.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.400
And any occupation is unjustified and illegal.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.240
And so, that's where I start from.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.840
That's the point that I come to this with.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.480
I think that the problem is that the Palestinians are told,

31:33.600 --> 31:37.360
find better ways to resist, and then they are demonized

31:38.320 --> 31:40.800
when they try to find any other way to resist.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.400
If you go back a few years ago, you had the Great Return March.

31:45.120 --> 31:51.360
People in Gaza marched to the wall in what was one of the most inspiring

31:52.320 --> 31:55.680
protests or demonstrations that I had ever seen.

31:56.480 --> 32:02.560
March to the wall, nonviolent protest, and snipers took out their legs.

32:02.560 --> 32:08.880
AP actually documented that Israeli snipers had knee counts,

32:08.880 --> 32:12.000
where you had an Israeli soldier that would say, I took out 45 knees.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.240
They actually had to register a scroll of knee counts.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.160
And so, you have all these kids in Gaza walking around without legs now,

32:18.160 --> 32:21.120
because they were targeted by snipers when they marched to the wall.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.640
We're told to find methods of nonviolent resistance.

32:24.640 --> 32:30.000
But when we boycott, when we launch boycotts around the world

32:30.880 --> 32:35.440
in response to this transgression, in response to this ongoing oppression

32:35.440 --> 32:41.120
that the world powers have shown either the inability or the unwillingness to reign in,

32:41.760 --> 32:45.040
we're told that that's anti-Semitic, even though it is based on

32:45.680 --> 32:49.440
the South African method of bringing an end to the apartheid regime there.

32:50.320 --> 32:57.680
So, don't respond with violence. Don't respond nonviolently. Don't protest.

32:58.560 --> 33:04.080
Don't try to use people power in the face of global impotence at the political level.

33:04.720 --> 33:07.280
Instead, let's just keep talking about the two-state solution.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.000
And while talking about the two-state solution, if you were to look at a map,

33:11.920 --> 33:17.280
under every single Israeli regime, conservative or liberal, whatever it is,

33:17.760 --> 33:21.520
the settlements have expanded. More Palestinian land has disappeared.

33:21.520 --> 33:25.200
More Palestinians have been dispossessed. More Palestinians have been killed.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.600
And so, we have these little pieces of land that keep on shrinking.

33:30.720 --> 33:37.120
And Jerusalem keeps disappearing. And there is aggression, whether Palestinians are resisting

33:37.120 --> 33:42.640
or not. But then we're told, why can't you people just pursue peace? Why can't you just

33:43.200 --> 33:49.280
believe in a better way? All along, we're hearing Israeli ministers become far more radical

33:50.000 --> 33:54.400
and open about their intentions to wipe us off the face of the earth.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.400
And that is actually their policy. It's not just slogans. It's not fringe elements.

33:58.400 --> 34:03.440
Actual Israeli ministers, starting from the prime minister himself, who has executed a policy of

34:03.440 --> 34:09.360
the removal of all Palestinian lands and Palestinian lives. And then we're told, peace, peace,

34:10.320 --> 34:15.760
and it is awfully ugly when you use the language of peace to suffocate the work of justice.

34:15.760 --> 34:21.040
You know, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of his early sermons was something along the lines of

34:21.040 --> 34:28.160
when peace is obnoxious. When peace is obnoxious. It was in the 1950s around the Montgomery bus

34:28.160 --> 34:35.840
boycott. And he talked about how this obsession with the language of peace is usually used to try

34:35.840 --> 34:42.480
to keep people in status quo and make them complacent with their miserable situation.

34:42.480 --> 34:47.120
That has been the story of the Palestinian people. That they've been told that if you do things

34:47.120 --> 34:52.560
differently, then you will find peace. But everything the Palestinians have tried,

34:53.280 --> 35:00.560
inside and outside, has been met with repression. The most violent forms of it, there, in Gaza,

35:00.560 --> 35:08.400
and beyond. And so, look, I start from the place of wanting to see peace. I want to see

35:09.520 --> 35:12.400
a situation in which no innocent people lose their lives.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.080
But we have to analyze the situation with some justice, with some fairness.

35:18.640 --> 35:25.600
What would any group of people do in this situation? That doesn't mean that you hope for

35:25.600 --> 35:30.720
hell. That means that you analyze the existing circumstances of hell,

35:30.720 --> 35:33.280
which was life in Gaza even before October 7th.

35:34.080 --> 35:38.480
That said, you did talk about waal al-aqtaqtu and dignity.

35:40.240 --> 35:45.520
And you mentioned transgressions. So there is places where violence can go too far.

35:46.320 --> 35:54.080
Absolutely. So violence, again, the point is, is that you ask yourself why we've been silent

35:54.080 --> 35:57.760
about the violence all of this time. And you know what? When people say,

35:57.760 --> 36:02.720
well, what about this? What about that? My response is this. What I would love to see

36:03.840 --> 36:11.920
is effective international bodies of justice being able to rein in any party that has committed

36:11.920 --> 36:15.680
an act of aggression or committed an act of injustice and hold them accountable.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.320
Any reasonable human being would say, yeah, you know what? There should be

36:21.200 --> 36:26.800
effective international bodies that can rein in parties that can't be reined in domestically,

36:26.800 --> 36:31.600
that could stop the violence, that could assign blame properly, and then have methods of

36:31.600 --> 36:37.040
accountability. The problem is that Israel has been made invincible in the international arena

36:37.040 --> 36:43.920
because of the United States. And then we wonder why there's such a rise in global anti-American

36:43.920 --> 36:50.240
sentiment. It's not because of American freedom. It's because America is directly participating

36:50.240 --> 36:54.320
the United States government is directly participating in the worst genocide that we

36:54.320 --> 37:00.960
have ever seen in our lives, right? Playing out on screen, you know, on social media.

37:01.760 --> 37:07.520
And we can't do anything about it. So I think that the point is, is that we need those international

37:07.520 --> 37:14.880
bodies. We need methods of effective accountability. And I would love to see blame properly assigned

37:14.880 --> 37:21.520
and anyone that kills any innocent human being taken to account, anyone that is guilty of a war

37:21.520 --> 37:27.360
crime taken to account. We have to ask ourselves, why is it that Israel has violated over 63 United

37:27.360 --> 37:33.360
Nations resolutions, has expanded its occupation, has killed over 600 Palestinians before October

37:33.360 --> 37:38.080
7th? Why is it that Israel cannot be held accountable? And so when you talk about,

37:38.800 --> 37:47.360
you know, words that get thrown around, you know, that are used to justify violence against more

37:47.360 --> 37:56.320
innocent people, you know, when I'm asked about terrorism, is it only terrorism if it's a non-state

37:56.320 --> 38:05.840
actor? If someone's sitting inside a room, you know, of suits and can press a button and terrorize

38:05.840 --> 38:11.600
thousands of people and murder innocent people with no consequences, how is that not terrorism?

38:11.600 --> 38:17.120
So if terrorism is only to be assigned to non-state actors, then it's a word without

38:17.120 --> 38:21.440
function. In fact, it's a word that justifies more terror that is then reigned upon innocent

38:21.440 --> 38:27.040
populations. We have to have moral consistency. Children should not be killed. Non-combatants

38:27.040 --> 38:32.560
should not be targeted. We can all agree upon that. Why aren't there proper investigative bodies and

38:32.560 --> 38:40.160
then proper international bodies of accountability then that can execute their findings in a way that

38:40.160 --> 38:44.160
makes the world a better place, in a way that actually brings about more peace? And so, you

38:44.160 --> 38:49.360
know, I think this is where we're at right now and this is the frustration and this is the

38:50.240 --> 38:54.880
place that the Palestinians have been left. So to you, violence becomes terrorism

38:56.240 --> 39:01.920
when women and children, non-combatants are killed, no matter who is doing the killing?

39:01.920 --> 39:04.480
Absolutely. Absolutely.

39:07.200 --> 39:15.360
In America, for you, for other Palestinians, other Muslims in your community,

39:16.000 --> 39:18.080
what has all of this been like?

39:19.920 --> 39:27.760
It feels like there is a return to some of the days after 9-11, the dehumanization,

39:28.080 --> 39:34.960
the feeling of complete disregard for our humanity at the level of government, at the level of media,

39:37.520 --> 39:41.360
the feeling of an increase in surveillance, the feeling of an increase in bigotry.

39:42.720 --> 39:54.160
People are losing their jobs and people are being berated on campuses and grocery stores

39:55.120 --> 40:01.200
and people are being killed. I went to the funeral of a six-year-old boy who was killed

40:01.200 --> 40:06.880
directly due to anti-Palestinian propaganda and so I think that a lot of us are feeling a return to

40:06.880 --> 40:16.640
that but we also refuse to be cornered into a position where we are told to perpetually condemn

40:17.360 --> 40:22.000
acts of violence and not speak about the violence that's committed against us here or abroad.

40:22.640 --> 40:28.560
Can you tell the story of this boy, Wadi Al-Fayyum? He's a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy who

40:28.560 --> 40:36.720
was stabbed 26 times in his home in Plainfield Township, Illinois. It was found to be a hate

40:36.720 --> 40:47.520
crime motivated by Islamophobia and the attacker said, you Muslims must die.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.720
You Muslims must die.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.080
So before Wadi Al-Fayyum was killed, Wadi Al-Fayyum was killed on a Saturday.

40:54.080 --> 40:59.360
It was the immediate Saturday after October 7th. I remember on Friday,

41:01.840 --> 41:08.320
media starts to reach out to every imam in the country, every Muslim leader in the country and

41:08.320 --> 41:11.920
say, what are you going to do about this global day of jihad? What are you going to do about the

41:11.920 --> 41:16.400
global day of jihad? It's like, what are you talking about? It's like, well, Hamas has called

41:16.400 --> 41:19.920
for a global day of jihad, so how are you going to stop Muslims from attacking people?

41:20.960 --> 41:25.120
Right? So it's Friday and I'm like, well, this is the first I'm hearing from you.

41:25.120 --> 41:29.760
And I remember responding to a local reporter. Most people I just ignored. I responded to a

41:29.760 --> 41:34.480
local reporter. I said, I've got people in my community that have already lost 10, 15 relatives

41:34.480 --> 41:40.880
at that point. Now it's 20, 30. And you haven't said a word. And now you're reaching out to me

41:40.880 --> 41:45.200
about the potential violence of Muslims in America. This is great. This is just like 9-11.

41:45.760 --> 41:51.760
What are you going to do to restrain you angry Muslims from responding to what's happening

41:51.760 --> 41:57.760
overseas and responding to the call of a global day of jihad? Guess what? That night,

42:00.080 --> 42:08.080
this man takes out a military knife and attacks a six-year-old boy, a six-year-old Palestinian boy.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.880
By the way, it gets worse the more details that you know. And I recently had a chance to go and

42:12.880 --> 42:16.320
speak to his mom because she was in the hospital when I was there for the funeral. So I had a

42:16.320 --> 42:21.600
chance to visit her not too long ago. And she was attacked also.

42:21.600 --> 42:27.120
She was attacked first. It was actually their landlord. So Hanan, the mother,

42:28.560 --> 42:35.920
was at home with Wadir, a six-year-old boy. Landlord comes in and with absolutely no emotion,

42:35.920 --> 42:41.680
just charges at her, starts with her. She was able to fight him off. He stabbed her.

42:42.400 --> 42:47.200
Initially, seven or eight times with a military-grade knife. She fought him off,

42:49.360 --> 42:59.120
escaped to call 9-1-1. And while she's calling 9-1-1, she hears Wadir. Wadir ran up to the man,

43:00.400 --> 43:06.720
calling him Uncle Joe because the landlord prior to that had been kind to them.

43:07.360 --> 43:12.480
Used to give Wadir toys. Wadir had an infectious, beautiful smile. Every picture you see of that

43:12.480 --> 43:18.640
kid, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful smile. And so Wadir runs up to him, says, Uncle Joe,

43:18.640 --> 43:23.600
he runs up to him to give him a hug even though he's carrying a military-grade knife with blood on

43:23.600 --> 43:30.400
it because Wadir doesn't believe that harm can come to him from that man. And Hanan didn't think

43:31.200 --> 43:37.680
that he would do anything to her kid, even in that fit of rage.

43:37.680 --> 43:47.120
The last thing that she says she heard was, Oh, no. Wadir says, Oh, no. And then he starts to stab

43:47.120 --> 43:56.000
him 26 times, says, you Muslims must die. Usually in a scene like that, police are hesitant

43:56.000 --> 44:01.280
to classify something as a hate crime. It was classified as a hate crime the very same day.

44:02.720 --> 44:08.400
The thing is, is that who's complicit in that hate crime? What filled that man's head for him

44:08.400 --> 44:12.640
to believe that he was doing an act of good by murdering a six-year-old Palestinian boy?

44:14.240 --> 44:23.360
And in reality, Uncle Joe was motivated by President Joe Biden, who repeated a debunked

44:24.160 --> 44:28.800
report that there were 40 beheaded Israeli babies. And he said, I saw 40 beheaded

44:28.800 --> 44:35.040
Israeli babies. The White House walked it back afterwards in a statement that no one reads

44:35.040 --> 44:44.160
because it was factually false. But Uncle Joe heard it and had been binge watching

44:45.440 --> 44:52.400
media about these violent Palestinians. And suddenly the propaganda overcame his own humanity

44:52.400 --> 45:01.920
and what he knew of that family. And he went in and ruined their lives. And now just like any mom,

45:03.760 --> 45:08.000
she hasn't moved a thing. His bike is still in the same place it was. His toys are still in

45:08.000 --> 45:13.920
the same place. She's left with this great void, this great emptiness. If that was the only crime,

45:13.920 --> 45:19.680
it would be enough to wake this country up and say, Oh, no, this is not where we need to go. Oh, no.

45:20.240 --> 45:25.760
The last thing she heard him say was, Oh, no. If that was it. And I got the news, by the way,

45:25.760 --> 45:31.440
when I was ironically at a protest. We were protesting on Saturday, downtown Dallas,

45:32.240 --> 45:41.760
and I started getting all these texts about what happened in Chicago. Oh, no. No Muslims attacked

45:41.760 --> 45:47.680
anyone. The media was in a frenzy over the global day of jihad. I got called by national news outlets

45:47.680 --> 45:54.480
and local news outlets. What are you going to do about Muslims that are going to turn into monsters

45:54.480 --> 45:59.440
and start killing people in the streets? Next thing we know, we have a dead six-year-old Palestinian

45:59.440 --> 46:05.680
boy who went to his funeral. And that kind of speaks to the proximity part of things.

46:09.040 --> 46:13.520
Yeah, it felt like stepping into Gaza for a moment. It didn't feel like America.

46:14.160 --> 46:20.560
Didn't feel like America. Felt like stepping into Gaza. His casket was wrapped in a Palestinian flag.

46:23.120 --> 46:26.480
There was not just sadness at his funeral, but a deep sense of anger.

46:27.520 --> 46:31.440
At the funeral, some of his family members shouted out, Joe Biden, you did this.

46:32.240 --> 46:43.360
Joe Biden, you did this. And I remember the next day, it was right after the funeral,

46:44.480 --> 46:53.440
looking at the front page of CNN. And the story of Wadir was buried in the last section.

46:55.200 --> 46:59.920
And it was right over all these meaningless ads. And I thought to myself, that's it.

47:00.800 --> 47:07.600
Like if this was an Arab man, let's be real. Let's be honest here. If this was a Palestinian

47:07.680 --> 47:14.480
landlord that stabbed a six-year-old Jewish boy to death, this would have gotten more attention.

47:14.480 --> 47:19.200
It would have been the front page of the news. And rightfully so, people would have grieved

47:20.160 --> 47:29.120
over the insanity of stabbing a six-year-old boy 26 times. Wadir became an afterthought

47:29.120 --> 47:35.760
the very next day. And so it's an extension of the bigotry, an extension of the racism.

47:36.400 --> 47:42.000
And there's so much that happens after that. There's the terrible stabbing of a Detroit

47:42.000 --> 47:47.520
synagogue president, Samantha Wall. And it's horrible. She was stabbed in her driveway.

47:48.080 --> 47:52.800
Immediately, front page of all the news outlets. Immediately, it's the main news story. And

47:52.800 --> 47:56.960
immediately the implications are, there go the Muslims. The Palestinians have lost their minds.

47:56.960 --> 48:02.160
The Muslims have, they are who we thought they were. That's what it is. They are who we thought

48:02.160 --> 48:07.840
they were. They went and they stabbed a synagogue president. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime,

48:08.560 --> 48:11.680
although it was an awful crime. It turned out it wasn't a hate crime.

48:12.560 --> 48:18.640
Wadir is an afterthought. People reach out to me afterwards expressing condolences,

48:19.840 --> 48:25.440
and I responded to them, those who have justified the genocide in Gaza,

48:26.560 --> 48:31.440
but that we're somehow offering condolences for Wadir privately, of course. By the way,

48:31.440 --> 48:35.920
if a Muslim would have committed that crime, every single Muslim leader would have had press

48:35.920 --> 48:40.640
in front of their door to condemn that crime. We would have all been made complicit.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.920
Had people reach out to me, say, I'm sorry about what happened with Wadir. It's terrible.

48:46.480 --> 48:50.720
I saw you at the funeral praying for you. My response was, what's the difference between

48:50.720 --> 48:57.680
Wadir and a boy in Gaza? What's the difference between me and Wadir? I'm a Palestinian child.

48:57.680 --> 49:03.600
My parents made it out of Palestine. I was born in this country. If I didn't have the opportunity

49:04.160 --> 49:09.120
to grow up here and to become the person that I became, you would have been justifying my murder

49:09.120 --> 49:13.360
right now. You would have been okay with my genocide. You would have been giving the talking

49:13.360 --> 49:18.560
points to the press to erase me, but you feel sorry because Wadir was killed. I think this is

49:18.560 --> 49:25.200
when we say that anti-Palestinian bigotry is an extension of Islamophobia. If a mosque gets

49:25.200 --> 49:31.440
targeted here, people rightfully rush to protect that mosque and say, this is horrible and it

49:31.440 --> 49:36.560
shouldn't happen. But when you have an Israeli soldier bombing a mosque and laughing like a

49:36.560 --> 49:41.120
maniac on video and it's going viral on TikTok and there's no way to rein that in and you don't have

49:41.120 --> 49:45.440
a word of condemnation about it, in fact, you are standing in the way of a ceasefire,

49:46.720 --> 49:51.680
then you're a hypocrite. There's no way around it. You are a hypocrite. What's the difference

49:51.680 --> 49:55.360
between a mosque here and a mosque there? What's the difference between a Palestinian life here

49:55.360 --> 49:59.680
and a Palestinian life there? If you're okay with me being murdered there, don't say that you care

49:59.680 --> 50:05.040
about my life here. And so that hypocrisy has been laid bare. We have said multiple times,

50:05.040 --> 50:11.360
masks are falling. Masks are falling. People that we thought were decent people somehow

50:12.080 --> 50:20.160
have found it in themselves to justify a genocide. There is no shortage at this point of videos.

50:20.160 --> 50:24.080
And again, I could have made the excuse for you maybe in the first few weeks

50:25.920 --> 50:30.960
that you hadn't seen enough. But with all social media suppression across all platforms,

50:30.960 --> 50:35.520
there isn't a single platform that hasn't suppressed Palestinian voices. With all that

50:35.520 --> 50:42.000
suppression, there are enough videos at this point of children whose heads have been blown off,

50:42.000 --> 50:47.920
of children walking around without limbs, of parents carrying their kids in bags,

50:47.920 --> 50:52.720
not body bags. I mean, grocery bags because they don't even have body bags.

50:53.440 --> 50:58.080
And screaming out and saying, why are you doing this to me? Make it stop. And you come back and

50:58.080 --> 51:06.480
you tell that person, it's Hamas' fault. Where is your humanity? Where is your sense of decency?

51:06.480 --> 51:11.440
Isn't that the logic of the so-called terrorism that you condemn? Yeah, you can wipe out entire

51:11.440 --> 51:17.680
populations. You should have talked to Hamas. It's Hamas' fault. All the kids in the West Bank,

51:17.680 --> 51:26.000
like, where does this end? So what are your moral boundaries here? So if that's the logic

51:26.000 --> 51:31.920
that you're okay with, then in that case, when there's a mass shooter in a school in the United

51:31.920 --> 51:35.920
States, just bomb the whole school. In fact, bomb the whole town if you can't find the mass shooter.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.360
Where does this end for you? And so when I say people have lost their humanity,

51:42.320 --> 51:47.120
they're killing us overseas, but their hearts are dying. People have lost their humanity. They've

51:47.200 --> 51:53.200
lost any sense of morality and their moral boundaries. And being there and

51:55.600 --> 52:00.480
participating in this funeral, it was anger. I'm not used to that. I'm not used to that.

52:01.120 --> 52:06.800
I'm an imam. I pastor to people. I went to Christchurch, and that was the worst I'd ever

52:06.800 --> 52:16.640
seen before, where 50 Muslims were killed by a white supremacist. And he murdered them with such

52:16.640 --> 52:21.120
callousness, and I remember being at those funerals. And yeah, I mean, there was anger,

52:21.120 --> 52:26.800
but it was just profound sadness, because at least the rest of the world could all come out

52:26.800 --> 52:32.640
in one voice and say, that's wrong. Now, most of the world sees what's happening in Gaza and says,

52:32.640 --> 52:41.040
this is disgusting. Most of the world sees this and says, this is a genocide. But we happen to

52:41.040 --> 52:48.880
live in this bubble here where we're constantly being told we did this to ourselves. And that's

52:48.880 --> 52:56.480
the same logic that led to our initial expulsion, 1948. What was the crime of those 700,000 Palestinians

52:56.480 --> 53:01.360
that were driven out of their home in 1948? What did they do? They did not commit the Holocaust.

53:01.360 --> 53:06.880
They didn't have a mass murder of Jews at their hands. What did they do? What crime were they

53:06.880 --> 53:12.080
paying for? And so it's been the consistent theme. This is the story of our people,

53:12.080 --> 53:15.680
not since October 7th. This is the story of our people for the last 75 years.

53:17.120 --> 53:22.640
There is a deep geopolitical connection between the United States and that part of the world.

53:23.440 --> 53:27.040
What is the role of US politicians in all of this?

53:28.000 --> 53:39.280
You know, James Baldwin wrote about how Israel was created as an extension of United States policy

53:39.280 --> 53:44.400
to be a colonial entity at the gates of the Middle East and to function essentially as a military

53:44.400 --> 53:53.280
base out there and as a means of extending its policy throughout the Middle East. And it has

53:53.280 --> 53:57.360
functioned as such. The United States is not an honest peace broker. It never has been an

53:57.360 --> 54:06.400
honest peace broker. The United States has never shown any meaningful inclination towards peace,

54:07.520 --> 54:13.920
has guarded and protected Israel from international accountability, has made Israel

54:13.920 --> 54:19.520
invincible. The United States is not just responsible at the governmental level for

54:20.000 --> 54:24.800
the genocide. It's responsible for letting it get to this point in the first place.

54:25.840 --> 54:33.040
We have funded that arsenal. We've given them the most sophisticated weapons in the world

54:34.000 --> 54:40.400
to test on the most desperate population in the world. We've given them the weapons.

54:40.400 --> 54:50.240
Given them the weapons, it's been bipartisan. We have issued at most inconsequential statements

54:50.240 --> 54:56.320
of condemnation, but at the same time stopped any international body of law from actually

54:56.320 --> 55:02.640
holding it accountable. So the United States at this point, unfortunately, has rightfully lost

55:02.640 --> 55:09.600
all credibility. It should remove itself from this because it is not an honest peace broker.

55:09.600 --> 55:15.680
I think Americans are probably sick of us paying for wars in general. I think Americans

55:15.680 --> 55:21.680
are probably sick of our tax dollars going to funding a genocide while we have a rise

55:21.680 --> 55:27.760
of homelessness and income disparity here in the United States. I think that Americans

55:27.760 --> 55:36.160
probably don't like that we're making ourselves so deeply unpopular in the world because of

55:36.160 --> 55:43.600
Israel's actions. So in the immediate moment, make this stop. The United States could have had

55:43.600 --> 55:50.800
a ceasefire a long time ago. The United States could have ended this genocide right away.

55:52.240 --> 55:59.760
The reason why this is continuing is because of US foreign policy. In the process of Joe Biden

55:59.760 --> 56:04.320
talking about managing this crisis and talking about making things better, there have only been

56:04.320 --> 56:08.480
more bills that have come out of Congress. In fact, he's bypassed Congress to fund the arsenal,

56:08.480 --> 56:15.440
to keep replenishing the arsenal. Stop paying for weapons. Stop paying for someone else's war

56:15.440 --> 56:20.640
crimes. Stop protecting another country as it commits these war crimes. And if you can't be an

56:20.640 --> 56:27.200
honest peace broker, get out of the process. So there's money that you just mentioned and bills,

56:27.200 --> 56:33.040
and then there's rhetoric, which you also criticized, that he spoke about the head of babies

56:34.320 --> 56:39.440
and things of that nature. So where has Joe Biden fallen short?

56:40.080 --> 56:44.160
We need another podcast. That's going to take a few hours to talk about where Joe Biden has failed.

56:45.520 --> 56:50.560
For one, the first time he seemed to find the word Palestinian in his vocabulary was when he accused

56:50.560 --> 56:58.400
the Palestinians of lying about the death toll in Gaza. And then that turned out to also be false.

56:58.400 --> 57:02.720
In fact, the numbers that were coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry, according to multiple

57:03.680 --> 57:08.960
international bodies, have been under-reporting Palestinian casualty counts.

57:08.960 --> 57:14.720
Israeli intelligence has said that the civilian count or the death toll is actually higher than

57:14.720 --> 57:19.920
what's been coming out of the Gaza Health Ministry. So he's failed on that front. He has failed to

57:19.920 --> 57:26.000
speak to Palestinian humanity. He has spoken with deep passion and concern, as has Anthony Blinken,

57:26.000 --> 57:30.640
about the devastation in Israel and the way that people are feeling in Israel,

57:31.280 --> 57:38.320
and has shown nothing of that sort towards Palestinians. We don't want the rhetoric.

57:38.320 --> 57:47.360
We really don't want the rhetoric. When people say, call for a ceasefire, the United States

57:47.360 --> 57:54.240
has had an opportunity and has an opportunity to really walk back and reflect on its entire policy

57:54.240 --> 58:05.360
towards Israel-Palestine. This is a moment of reflection. This is a moment of restoration,

58:05.360 --> 58:09.600
if you want it to be, and to think about what we've enabled in the first place.

58:09.600 --> 58:20.640
He's shown absolutely no real empathy. And I think that he is under great delusion

58:21.360 --> 58:28.320
in thinking that the Muslim community or people of conscience are going to forget this come

58:28.320 --> 58:32.240
November. You can't tell us that, well, at least I don't have the Trump Muslim ban

58:33.200 --> 58:37.760
while also carrying out a genocide primarily against Muslims and think that the Muslims are

58:37.760 --> 58:44.720
still going to vote for you. And so we will make him hear us at the polls. And any politician

58:45.280 --> 58:52.000
that has not called for a ceasefire, that has been a part of this dehumanization,

58:53.200 --> 58:58.400
we will make sure that we see support for them in any way as a community. It's only right.

58:59.440 --> 59:03.920
So Biden is losing the hearts and the support of the Muslim

59:05.120 --> 59:08.160
Palestinian people and the Muslim people in America.

59:08.160 --> 59:11.680
I don't know if he ever had the hearts of the Muslim community, to be honest with you. I mean,

59:11.760 --> 59:15.360
I personally was never a Joe Biden fan. I think a lot of people felt the same.

59:16.000 --> 59:21.280
This country, unfortunately, leads to the way that our political system is built is that you're

59:21.280 --> 59:25.520
always voting for the lesser of the two evils. That's always the way that it is. It's analyzing

59:25.520 --> 59:31.280
which evil is lesser. And when people say, if you vote for Donald Trump, and I'm not planning to

59:31.280 --> 59:38.640
vote for Donald Trump either, but if you don't vote for Joe Biden, then you are destroying

59:38.640 --> 59:43.040
democracy. I'm like a democracy that's given us a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is

59:43.040 --> 59:47.680
already a failed democracy. And so he never had the hearts and minds of the Muslim community.

59:48.480 --> 59:54.800
People always saw past his rhetoric. He always has had a terrible disposition towards Palestine.

59:54.800 --> 59:58.240
He's always had a terrible disposition towards the Muslim world.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:05.040
His segregationist past comes out sometimes when he starts talking about the Muslim world.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.320
You can hear the racism in his voice and you can hear the way that he talks about

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:18.480
Palestinian life in such devalued fashion. He lost us a long time ago, but he's definitely

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:26.400
not getting us back after this in any way. I can't speak for all Muslims, but I think that

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:32.800
come November, he and all of those politicians, especially in swing states that have

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:38.000
turned their backs on the Muslim community, and not just the Muslim community, by the way,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.200
67% of this country wants a ceasefire. Three fourths of Democratic voters want a ceasefire.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:48.240
Half of Republican voters want a ceasefire. It's not just the Muslim community. This is not

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:53.600
some radical opinion to call for a ceasefire. And every single politician that has refused to hear

01:00:53.600 --> 01:01:00.960
us is going to pay a price at the polls as they should. That doesn't mean that we're under any

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:08.320
illusion that the other side promises us anything better. In fact, it feels like Republicans have

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.240
simply rushed to outrace the Democrats, to outpace them in terms of talking about how they're going

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:21.360
to be more unapologetic in supporting Israel unconditionally. It's been pathetic,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.920
but something has to change. And I think that Americans of conscience

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.880
have to look at how this failed political system has hurt people here and abroad,

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.480
and talk about how to transcend that with just more humanity. Again, when you have 67%

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:45.040
of the American public that wants a ceasefire, but only a handful of congressmen out of over 500

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:53.440
can muster up the courage in the face of these super PACs to say that we should stop the genocide.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.640
Right? And it's like, what are you asking for here? You're asking for the genocide to stop.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:03.360
You're asking for Israeli hostages to be brought home. You're asking for Palestinian prisoners to

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:09.600
be released. You're asking for peace and to start carving the path out to end this once and for all,

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.160
right? In the most ambiguous way possible, by the way, because there aren't many radical American

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:20.480
politicians, right? It's the way that the system is. In the most ambiguous, bare way possible.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:25.040
And you can't even bring yourself to do that. This is already a failed democracy then.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:31.600
All the while, again, it always boggles my mind. If you're from the America First crew,

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:37.680
what's America First about funding billions and billions and billions of dollars to Israel while

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:43.840
it carries out this genocide, while people are starving here? And if you're part of the

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.040
human rights crew and progressive crew, they have a term called progressive except Palestine,

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:54.400
right? PEP, progressive except Palestine. Where are all your notions of social justice?

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.560
You talk about policing here, but you don't talk about who trains our police departments

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.720
in many major cities and the type of brutality that's being carried out there. You talk about

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:06.960
human rights at the border here, but you don't talk about the assault on people at the border

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.800
there. You talk about all of these things here, but you somehow use the exact same framings

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:21.360
against the people there. So it's exposed, I think, the moral bankruptcy of both political

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.920
polar opposites that exist in this country right now and hopefully evoked a greater societal

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:36.880
sentiment to say, this is ridiculous. One of the things that is happening is that more people are

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:44.240
getting their news outside of legacy media outlets. You can't hide that many dead babies

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.720
anymore. You just can't. More people have woken up to the Palestinian plight now than ever before.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.320
More people are outraged that this has been our American foreign policy all throughout

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.400
Democratic and Republican administrations. This is what we've been paying for. This is what we've

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.840
been excusing. Israeli leaders literally spit in the faces of whoever the American president is

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:13.120
and says, yeah, we don't care what they tell us to do. American leadership says,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:20.160
we're pushing Israel to minimize the casualties, to get less indiscriminate with its bombing,

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.920
to manage the crisis, get a few more humanitarian corridors in,

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.640
to make sure that Gaza is not evacuated and not ethnically cleansed, to make sure Palestinians

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.360
can come back. Netanyahu comes on TV and says, from the river to the sea. How ironic is that?

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.520
From the river to the sea, and that is his policy. We're going to make sure that Israel

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:45.120
controls from the river to the sea and we're going to push Palestinians into Sinai and Muslim

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.280
countries need to take them in. You have Israeli ministers, national defense ministers saying

01:04:52.240 --> 01:05:00.400
things openly. We want to thin out the population, i.e. ethnic cleansing. We want to remove people

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:04.640
and the Muslim world needs to step up and take in these refugees.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.120
The American administration or the American president says and American secretary of state

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.560
says, we're talking to them and we're making sure that that's not going to happen. If one of their

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.600
ministers says something, blink in, maybe tweets out something about how that's not going to happen,

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.480
but then it happens anyway, and then we still write them the checks. I think most of the American

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:31.040
public is probably going to get sick of this at some point. Just people of decency and people

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.800
of conscience are going to say, yeah, this is not something we want to be a part of anymore.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.480
Do you think there's something that Donald Trump can do

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:43.600
to help move this in the right direction?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:51.360
Yeah. Trump's first words were about how he's going to be worse on this. He talked about how

01:05:52.080 --> 01:06:00.960
he's going to deport people, revoke visas of students that are part of these pro-Palestinian

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:07.280
rallies. Also, the focus was on the rallies versus what's going on abroad.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:11.200
Yeah, but look, we had a Donald Trump presidency. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He was not

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:16.400
better on this. Unfortunately, this is a bipartisan problem. Again, we're under no

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.000
illusion here. We're not looking to Donald Trump as a savior here, but we are going to penalize

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.440
Joe Biden. I can't speak for everybody, but I think that that's where a lot of our minds are at right

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:33.760
now. You spoke at the November 4th demonstration in Washington called the Free Palestine March.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.640
It had a lot of people, several hundred thousand people there. What do you remember from that

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.320
experience? Well, the first thing I remember is that there was no news coverage of it.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:49.200
Four hundred thousand people march on D.C., one of the largest marches in history.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.400
It was nowhere to be found in mainstream media coverage, whereas when the Stand with Israel

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.400
rally happened, between the three hundred thousand strong Palestine rally and the four hundred

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:04.480
thousand strong Palestine rally, there was a Stand with Israel rally where congressmen were

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:10.320
bussed from congress to speak at that rally. Democrats and Republicans and high profile

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:19.440
celebrities. It was live streamed across multiple places. I have to say this. The ICJ,

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:28.880
if that wasn't the greatest display of media bias in the domain of United States mainstream media,

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.640
then I don't know what is. They live streamed the Israeli defense on multiple news outlets,

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:40.400
defending itself against the case for genocide and completely omitted the South African

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:48.160
presentation of the crimes of Israel the day before. What I remember first and foremost

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:52.800
about the protest is that there were nowhere to be found on mainstream media, which was expected.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:59.280
But what I also remember from the actual day of and from all of the pro-Palestine rallies

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:06.160
is that I have never seen a more multi-faith, more diverse group of people consistently coming out

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.120
for Palestine against the genocide in Gaza that I have this time around. I think that has been the

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.720
experience all around. There has been a pronounced Jewish presence, Jewish voice for peace, if not

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.440
now, other anti-Zionist Jewish groups, groups that are against the genocide, against the occupation,

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:29.440
former Israeli soldiers even that have been showing up at these protests. There has been

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:38.960
a pronounced presence from Native American groups, Indigenous groups, all across the board. Christians,

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.600
Jews, Muslims. I have never seen more diversity at these rallies than I have seen this time around,

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:51.040
which I think is a sign of where things are going. If you look at the under 35 opinion polls,

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.480
it's very clear that there's a generational gap here, that the country is moving into

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.880
a more coherent direction and understanding what has been happening over there.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.480
People from all backgrounds are standing up to it now.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:12.560
What do you think about the protests on campus against Israel?

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:19.920
Every protest I've been to has had the exact same tenor, has had the exact same messaging,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:23.440
but you always have that idiot or two that shows up with a sign,

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.640
and no one knows who that idiot is, ironically. He never comes with anybody else, always shows

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.840
up somehow in the middle of the protest and puts up a sign that says something completely contrary

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:40.880
to the messaging of the protest, and all the cameras shift towards that guy. I see it every

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:48.160
single time, but the overwhelming tenor of all of these protests has been consistent.

01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:53.680
It's been calling for freedom. It's been calling for liberation. It's been calling for an end to

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.560
the genocide, a ceasefire, an end to the occupation, an end to the apartheid. I will tell you what

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:06.480
many people are not seeing. Columbia University, two IDF soldiers, former IDF soldiers, spraying

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:15.280
Palestinian protesters with skunk water, which is what the IDF uses on Palestinian protesters,

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:21.520
and sometimes on worshipers on their way to Masjid al-Aqsa, which has multiple

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.160
health repercussions. I was reading about how one of the students that was sprayed on campus,

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:36.400
that Columbia Palestinian student, has showered at this point of us doing this podcast 11 times

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:42.640
cannot get the smell out of her, has suffered all sorts of health issues as a result of being

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.080
sprayed. Again, people are not seeing the other side here. People are not seeing what we've had

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.640
to deal with at these protests, the open bigotry. I want you to think about this, by the way.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:58.560
People go and serve in the IDF and then come back to the United States or the United Kingdom,

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:05.840
and they're not stigmatized for participating in apartheid policies or participating in a genocide.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:10.400
How am I supposed to feel as a Palestinian knowing that this guy right next to me

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:19.680
participated in murdering my relatives in Gaza and has open reign to say what he wants to say

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:25.520
or do what he wants to do? We haven't seen the other side of that as well, but I'd recommend

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:32.160
to anyone that's talking about pro-Palestine protests to actually go see one. If you go to

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.920
the protests, you listen to what's being said, and you don't just capture them. You've got 400,000

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:45.280
people. You're going to find four stupid people at a protest of 400,000 people because the protest

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:55.440
scene is always messy. I think that this is a sign of the outrage and the anger and the frustration

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:02.320
that many students have about being silenced, again, in the media and academic settings.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:08.320
Professors are losing their jobs. Students are having their faces put on trucks, being doxxed.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.360
These shady watch lists that get put out. I'm on a few of them as well, and I just don't care anymore.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.160
But you've got these shady watch lists. People are losing their jobs at law firms.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.960
They're losing all of their future opportunities, young Palestinian students.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.520
Because of something that they tweeted that's being taken out of context 10 years ago,

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:40.320
when they were 17 years old, it's ridiculous. I think that we have to listen to the overwhelming

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:46.160
majority of voices of people that are demonstrating for justice. Not demonstrating

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:53.360
against anyone, but demonstrating for people. Again, there's a large pronounced Jewish presence

01:12:53.360 --> 01:13:00.320
at every single pro-Palestine march. In fact, if you look at the organizations, the groups that

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:09.280
have taken over Capitol Hill and train stations, it's been if not now, not in our name, never again

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:17.200
means for anyone. It's been Jewish groups, many Jewish anti-occupation groups that have

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:21.280
been at the forefront. I think that that's where we have to pay attention to the beauty of

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.800
how diverse this movement for a free Palestine has actually been.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:32.240
So the average sentiment is anti-occupation, not anti-Semitic?

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:41.920
It's incredibly lazy, incredibly lazy to say that anti-Zionism or that anti-occupation

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.840
is anti-Semitic. First and foremost, the Palestinians are a Semitic people. That's number one.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:54.800
Number two, look, I'm proud of my community. My community has stood against anti-Semitism

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.400
in this country. The Muslim community has been at the forefront of condemning anti-Semitism.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.400
We have stood in front of synagogues. We have stood with the Jewish community when the Jewish

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.880
community is attacked. This is about occupation. This is a story of a colonial entity that has

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:17.120
driven us out of our homes and has done so in such a way that has forced us to try to be the voice

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.040
of a people that are being exterminated overseas right now.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.200
This is not an anti-Semitic movement. This is a pro-freedom movement.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.400
Do you think the protests ever go too far?

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.200
The protest scene is a messy scene. And so again, you're going to have

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.280
sometimes that odd speaker or people get carried away in their emotions. And yes,

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:46.880
sometimes people chant things or do things that are contrary to the protests. It's pretty unfair

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:52.320
when you judge the entire protest movement by some of these incidents that have happened at

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:56.880
protests and you don't pay attention to what they're protesting about in the first place,

01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:03.680
which is a genocide. Right now, everything is secondary to ending a genocide that is ongoing.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.720
In the course of this discussion, it's not an exaggeration to say that at least 30,

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:14.400
40 people would have been killed just over the last few hours because we're averaging 135 to 150

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.760
a day. So everything else is secondary to that. This is where we all need to be right now as people

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.240
of conscience. How do we stop this? Because every single day is deeply costly.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:33.120
Do you think there has been a rise of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate in the US?

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:40.080
Yeah, I think that's factual. Look, anti-Semitism is always to be condemned. It's wrong. It's

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.280
something that as a Muslim community and as people of conscience, we have always taken

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.400
a stand against. Jewish people should not be attacked for being Jewish people here

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.600
or anywhere else. Synagogues should be protected. And if a person is attacked for being Jewish,

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.600
we will be the first to go and to stand with them and to reject that attack on them.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:11.680
And there has been, as I said, an inspiring pronounced Jewish presence in the movement

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:19.040
to end the occupation. And so we're being morally consistent here. As far as the rise in Islamophobia,

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:26.080
it is felt, it's under-reported, and it is part of the same framing

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.000
that has led to the devastation of our people overseas. So there's a rise in Islamophobia,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.240
there's a rise in anti-Semitism, there's a rise in hatred. All of that is true,

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.720
but there's also an ongoing genocide and that should be our priority right now to end.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.760
I think we spoke last time about a year ago.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.400
How has your view on Benjamin Netanyahu evolved over time?

01:16:53.440 --> 01:17:00.480
Benjamin Netanyahu has committed himself to the erasure of Palestinian people

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:08.080
and Palestinian symbols and Palestinian land from the very beginning of his political career.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:15.520
This is who he has been. We just haven't been listening to him. He campaigns on bigotry and

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:21.840
racism and on the promise that there would never be a Palestinian state. He campaigns on the promise

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:28.320
that Gaza would be wiped out. He campaigns by saying the Arabs are rushing to the polls,

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:33.200
we need to make sure that they don't infect our policy. He has always been this person.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:39.280
This has always been his policy. He has always indicated that genocide and ethnic cleansing

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:46.160
is where he wants to go. So he's simply manifesting what his message has always been.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:52.640
Anyone that ignores that is being disingenuous. You can find statements from Benjamin Netanyahu

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.400
in the 80s, 90s, 2000s. You can find him talking about this prior to October 7th and after October

01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:02.800
7th. He's definitely doing this now to save his political career. I think he wants to drive this

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.360
as long as he possibly can because he knows that his days in office are numbered.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:16.720
But let's also ask ourselves why is it that Benjamin Netanyahu was able to rise to power

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:21.840
in the first place? There's something deeply troubling about the fact that his messaging

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:29.040
ever resonated and what the prospects are for peace if Benjamin Netanyahu is able to rise

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.120
with such pronounced hateful messaging.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:41.200
So the claim that security of Israel is the primary concern is you're saying a dishonest claim?

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:46.720
I think he's trying to secure his seat in office. He knows his days are numbered. This is not about

01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.640
Israel. This isn't about the hostages for him. This isn't about anything but Benjamin Netanyahu.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:19:03.840
He is a narcissist. He's a tyrant. He is despised around the world and I think even amongst

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.880
Israelis, I think there's a de-patriot form. I think the hostages' families know that he doesn't

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:14.880
care about the families or about the hostages, but he's driving a political agenda that doesn't

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:22.000
care about people, not Palestinian people or otherwise. However, the problem of the

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.840
occupation is not Benjamin Netanyahu. The problem of the occupation is the occupation.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:34.960
Yair Lapid was the progressive moderate alternative and he drove just as bigoted

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.040
of an agenda against the Palestinian people as possible. So to the Palestinian that's living

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:45.520
in Gaza or the Palestinian in the West Bank, whoever's sitting in that seat has meant the

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:51.440
exact same thing to them. But Benjamin Netanyahu is certainly, I think, the loudest bigot that

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:58.800
we have seen in that seat. Do you think Israel has the right to defend its borders?

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.520
I think Israel has a responsibility to protect those that it occupies.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:11.840
I think you have to ask that question differently. Noor Arakat wrote a tremendous article on this

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:21.520
from a legal perspective. When you talk about Israel defending itself, Israel is bound to

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.600
occupation law. This is the problem all along. When John Kerry said, of course, the US is great

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.000
sometimes at issuing inconsequential statements that Israel has to choose whether or not it wants

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:41.040
to be a Jewish or a democratic state, but it can't be both. Israel wants to occupy and deny

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.920
and at the same time not be held to the standards of being an occupier, but be treated as if it's

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:54.160
some normal state. Those borders were drawn across occupied land and have been expanding

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.240
into Palestinian territory and people have been thrown out of their homes systematically

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.480
and transgressed upon even in the places that they fled to, which is Gaza.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.320
When you talk about Israel having a right to defend itself, you should be talking about Israel's

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.520
duty to protect everyone under its occupation. Either lift the occupation or protect everyone

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:22.400
under your occupation. Where are your borders? What is your responsibility? Who are you protecting?

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:28.080
I think that it speaks to the fact that Israeli policy considers Palestinians to be animals.

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:35.760
They say as much and they do as much. I've spoken about James Baldwin and James Baldwin

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.160
talked about this pious silence surrounding Israel that we're supposed to pretend

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:48.640
like it's just another state and ignore how it came into being and what it functions as.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:55.360
I think that pious silence has to be broken. I remember John Stewart when he had The Daily Show

01:21:55.360 --> 01:22:02.640
several years ago and he talked about this policy of we have to defend ourselves and if

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:07.920
someone was attacking your home, what would you do? The response was, well, why are you forcing

01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:14.160
people into a closet? You force people into this desperate situation. You drive them out of their

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:21.520
homes, claim their homes, and then say that you're defending yourself against them. The default is

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:27.680
that an occupied people have a right to defend themselves. The occupier is obligated to those

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:36.800
that they occupy. Can you speak to this term occupation in Gaza? Because the people that

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:44.640
say it is not an occupation say that Israeli troops have been pulled out from there before

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:50.640
October 7th for many years. To you, it still is a de facto occupation.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:58.880
Israel doesn't get to set the terms and then define them. It is an occupation according to

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:06.880
any international legal standard. Israel controls the movement of everyone in Gaza.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:12.720
It controls the air and the seas. It controls the ability to import or export.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.720
The people that live in Gaza and the people that live in the West Bank,

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.520
the Palestinians have had their identity stolen from them. There's the freedom of movement.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:30.000
There is the freedom of thriving. There is self-determination. All of that has been

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:35.840
stolen from the people of Gaza. There's no airport in Gaza that was destroyed by Israel as well.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:43.920
It is an occupation at every level and by any meaningful legal determination.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.040
What do you think about Yemen's Houthi rebels attacking Israel in response to October 7th

01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:58.320
and then the United States and the UK initiating bombing of multiple targets in Yemen

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:05.360
in response to that? Yeah, I think that it's clear that the United States cares more about

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.000
its shipping lanes than it does about Palestinian lives and that actually has proved it. Look,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:17.920
I do not support the Houthis as Houthis or their policies in general, but if you

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:25.520
look at what has transpired and what they have said, they're attacking these ships in response

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:31.680
to the occupation or in response to the genocide and saying that they will continue to do so,

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:39.120
to stop business as usual until a ceasefire is reached. They have not killed anyone.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:45.520
They have seized ships. They have blocked the lanes, but they have said that if a ceasefire

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:52.160
happens, they will cease their activity. Instead of the United States trying to get a ceasefire

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:58.160
through, the United States decided, let's go bomb Yemen too. Let's spend more money on weapons and

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:03.600
killing innocent people, which shows you exactly where our policy always leads itself to,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:11.920
unfortunately. I think that most reasonable people would say that the problem is not with

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:20.320
Yemeni rebels attacking ships. The problem is with Israel attacking innocent Palestinian lives.

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:28.000
You mentioned paying respects to the legacy of EBJ, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and

01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.240
remembering Palestinian child prisoners. Can you explain?

01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:40.080
So Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson was one of the few co-sponsors of a bill that has been on

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.040
the floor of Congress for years, initially sponsored by Congresswoman Betty McCollum

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:54.160
to penalize Israel for its detention of child prisoners, thousands of children arbitrarily

01:25:54.160 --> 01:26:00.480
detained, put in military courts, solitary confinement, and yes, sexual violence that's

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.000
been documented by human rights organizations against them, and there have been no repercussions.

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.680
So I want you to think about this, just the thought of conditioning aid to Israel,

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.640
so that it doesn't indiscriminately bomb entire populations, has not been able to find any home

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:27.520
in mainstream American politics. For years, just trying to stop Israel from picking up children

01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:34.480
and throwing them into military prisons where they disappear for decades at times has not found

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.400
any thrust in mainstream American politics, whereas any resolution that is pro-Israel

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.440
will make it past both chambers relatively quickly. When people talk about Israeli hostages

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:53.440
and then talk about Palestinian prisoners, there's already a problem with that framing.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.640
First of all, all 2.2 million people in Gaza are hostages. Every Palestinian that lives

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:05.920
under occupation is a hostage, but all of those prisoners that have been picked up, women, children,

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:14.160
innocent people with absolutely no process of making sure that they're treated right

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:22.400
or given fair trials or even given a communication line with their families

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.080
or with any government to help them is absolutely criminal. All of these people

01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:32.720
is absolutely criminal. All of those prisoners are also hostages.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.840
And when you are already proposed this idea that there are Israeli hostages and Palestinian

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:48.240
prisoners, you're already implying that one group is complicit in their own devastation,

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:53.360
whereas another group has had devastation visited upon them entirely out of their own doing.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:01.600
And so, it's important for people to learn about children prisoners who are indeed hostages

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:08.480
to an apartheid system. And even what happened during that four-day truce,

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:16.880
which all of us hoped would be extended and become permanent, where 150 Palestinian prisoners were

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:22.000
released, Israel just went and picked up another 135 in the West Bank and threw them in prisons.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.120
That's what I mean when I say you're not addressing the root of the problem.

01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:29.120
The root of the problem is the occupation. The root of the problem is the apartheid.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:36.960
The root of the problem is the desperation that then drives the creation of all sorts of

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:44.480
circumstances that will only further lead to the devastation of everyone. If you don't solve that

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:49.520
problem and at the root of that problem is the dehumanization of the Palestinian because no one

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:57.280
is raising alarms for those Palestinian hostages in Israeli military prisons. No one's putting up

01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.800
their pictures and no one's talking about who they are and their human stories and the violence

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:08.800
that's been wreaked against them at every level. So, if you don't solve not just the root of

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.600
occupation but also the dehumanization that drives the occupation, which is unfortunately

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:19.120
so pervasive right now in the discourse, then you're going to continue to have this gap

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.800
and how the world sees the plight of the Palestinians and how unfortunately the American

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:31.360
public sees the problem of the Palestinians. And to you, big peace agreements like

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:37.040
of the like of Abraham Accords should include Palestine.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:45.600
Abraham Accords is nothing but an agreement in which you slap the name of Abraham on arms deals

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.960
in exchange for countries being able to undertake their own unholy pursuits.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.760
They use one of the holiest names in history and continue to erase

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:04.320
the main victims of this atrocity. And so, the Abraham Accords are an insult to humanity,

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:08.240
an insult to the Palestinians, and an insult to the name of Abraham.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:17.040
But do you think something like that, agreements of that nature, of that scale could be made

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.440
that include the Palestinian people and that would actually make progress?

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:28.000
If they're honest to the plight of the Palestinians, if they are honest to the roots of the problem,

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.440
absolutely. Look, again, peace is sought but peace cannot be used to silence.

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:41.840
The entire peace process has been hung over the Palestinians all these years while settlements

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:47.760
continue to expand and their situation only continue to get worse. Is Israel really going

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:56.960
to remove the 700,000, 800,000 settlers, right? And suddenly changes tune on a two-state solution?

01:30:57.600 --> 01:31:01.760
Benjamin Netanyahu is saying right now and he's speaking to unfortunately what is

01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:07.440
unfortunately what is clearly a majority of the Israeli public, that there will never be

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:16.080
a Palestinian state. So, these peace talks cannot be used to suffocate all of the work of justice

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:22.480
and bringing Israel to accountability. The world has to act when they see apartheid,

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:29.440
the world has to act when they see occupation. If the world fails to bring Israel to a place

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:35.920
of accountability, then a few countries that have their own agendas cannot put forth anything

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.400
meaningful for the victims of Israel being the Palestinian people.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.720
There's a lot of questions I want to ask you about the nature of resistance and what is

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:52.240
the proper way to resist, what is the practical, pragmatic, effective ways of resisting.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.120
So, one example that is often brought up is the difference between MLK and Malcolm X.

01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:05.200
One emphasized nonviolent resistance, the other emphasized any means necessary resistance.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:15.920
Which do you side with in general and in this particular case of what has happened over the

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:25.280
past 100 plus days? So, in general, that framing relies on a standardization of Dr. Martin Luther

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:33.120
King Jr. and a vilification of Malcolm X that a lot of people do put forth and present as two

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:40.800
polar opposites and how they approach the plight of black people in America and resisting racism

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:47.520
here in America. When I taught a course at Southern Methodist University on MLK and Malcolm X and

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:52.560
Islam and the Civil Rights Movement, what I'd often do is I'd give my students a set of quotes

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:57.200
and I would say assign this to Malcolm or Martin and they'd always get it wrong.

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:03.520
So, you can find quotes from MLK and breaking the silence and especially when he took a stand

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:10.560
against the Vietnam War that sounds so radical when you compare them to the image of MLK.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:18.160
Malcolm is, of course, turned into this militant angry Muslim who just wanted violence and was

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.720
seeking chaos here in the United States. So, let's be clear about something here that Malcolm

01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:33.600
never himself was part of any violence. Malcolm never did anything violent. Malcolm found it

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:40.160
hypocritical to commit the oppressed people to nonviolence while not restraining the oppressor

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:47.520
from its violence. And I agree with Malcolm. It is absolutely hypocritical to focus your attention

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:53.840
and your energy on the oppressed people and committing them to nonviolence while not directing

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:59.440
your attention to the oppressor. When you have such asymmetry, when you have a clear aggressor

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.200
and aggressed upon, you have a clear colonial entity and a clear colonized people, you focus

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.480
your energy on restraining the colonial power. You focus your energy on restraining the oppressor,

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:18.240
not the oppressed. And so, that was Malcolm's point and it's clear in his messaging throughout

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:23.680
his religious growth because, of course, Malcolm did evolve as a person, but Malcolm found it

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:30.320
deeply hypocritical to commit the oppressed to nonviolence. Malcolm also had a deep understanding

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:37.360
of the way that brutality here, state violence in the United States was connected to its state

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:44.400
violence abroad and American imperialism as a whole. Malcolm was the first to speak on Vietnam,

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.160
the first major African American leader to speak on Vietnam. Martin followed. Malcolm also went to

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:57.920
Gaza in 1964. 1964, went to Khan Yunus, which is now under heavy bombardment, and Malcolm penned

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.240
an essay on Zionism and connected Zionism to American imperialism and the broader implications

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:13.440
of America's foreign policy. So, Martin and Malcolm, if you look at them in the capacity

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:20.480
of what's happening right now, where I would say you can find something that is deeply profound,

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.120
James Cohn wrote a book called Malcolm and Martin Dreams and Nightmares.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:32.720
And he wrote something profound to the effect that Martin tried to liberate white people from

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:37.760
their own racism, whereas Malcolm tried to liberate black people from the effects

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.760
of that racism on them. And so they both played a deeply important role. Self-determination

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:51.680
is crucial to maintain the fuel of a movement. And I think one of the things that probably

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:57.200
deeply frustrates those that have sought the erasure of Palestine is that Palestinian

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:04.960
consciousness has only continued to grow after 75 years. Palestinians in diaspora and Palestinians

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.840
within occupied territory all are deeply rooted in their Palestinian identity and existence,

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.120
and they're not going away. So, I think that that's where the function is important of this,

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.360
whereas those that are complicit in the oppression need to be liberated from their own oppression,

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:27.440
and liberated from what they're participating in. Most Americans that I talk to

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.200
that have absolutely no idea about what's going on, when they come to hear just a few stories

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.400
of the plight of the Palestinian people and the types of brutality that we have encountered,

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.320
wake up to this and say, oh my God, this is what my tax dollars go to.

01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:53.040
This is what I'm a part of. So, we have to liberate people across the board from being oppressors or

01:36:53.040 --> 01:37:00.160
from being oppressed. What do you think about the seeming fact that majority of Palestinians

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:06.800
support the October 7th attacks? You have to see the world, their world through their eyes.

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:13.200
You can't try to see their world through your eyes. If you live under occupation,

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:22.000
you're routinely harassed at Israeli checkpoints. The occupation is expanding

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.800
into your territory. You're meeting families regularly that have been thrown out of their

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:33.600
homes and that are looking for a new place in the shrinking territory. You deal with routine

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:41.120
airstrikes. You have no way to get out. You have no way to grow. You don't even have a passport.

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:46.160
Your education is subpar. Your standards of living are lower than the rest of the world.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:53.760
And all you hear from the other side, which dominates the discourse and dominates every

01:37:53.760 --> 01:38:01.600
element of your existence, are promises of erasure, of complete erasure. 13,000 people,

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:10.400
I mentioned, 2023, 13,000 new settlement units being advanced. If that happened anywhere,

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.640
just think about what that means when you clear out a village or two.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.760
It's not that big of a territory. When you know that that's happening and when you have

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:28.880
been subjected to that, anyone that claims to be supporting you or uplifting you from that state

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.080
of misery is going to have sympathy. Whether you agree with their mission or their methods or not,

01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:40.640
it's human. It is human that if anyone says that they are going to get you out of this misery

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:47.360
and inflict pain on those who have given you a life of pain and promised you a future of pain,

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:52.640
you're going to have sympathy to that group, whether you agree with them or not.

01:38:53.760 --> 01:39:00.000
I think that the question also has to be asked. What about the Israeli public? Israel holds all

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.360
of the power in that region, holds all of the power over that territory, is able to dominate

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:14.320
the expansion of its own territory and diminish any Palestinian territory, is able to place

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:19.280
restrictions whenever it wants on Palestinian movement, trying to get to their holy sites or

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:23.120
otherwise, whether it's Mezul Aqsa or the Holy Sepulcher or the Church of Nativity.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:30.720
Right? The majority of the Israeli public before October 7th, unfortunately,

01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:37.600
according to all polls, favors a non-democratic regime, the end of a two-state solution,

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.600
does not care about the plight of Palestinian people, the majority of the Israeli public.

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:48.400
Why is that? And what does that mean for Palestinians? Right? Especially now,

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.760
after this genocide, the vast majority of the Israeli public does not favor a ceasefire.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:02.720
Right? What are we supposed to do when we see mainstream media coming out of Israel,

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:10.560
pop culture, TikTok videos that only speak to a greater desire to eliminate the Palestinian

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.400
people? Right? So anyone that says that they are going to support your plight,

01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:23.680
whether you agree with their mission or their methods, is going to resonate with that child

01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:29.360
that has grown up in those desperate circumstances. Bassem Youssef had an interview with Piers Morgan

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:36.080
and he was talking about this. He literally gave it a human story. If you're a child that's grown

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:42.080
up, you've lost limbs, your parents are dead, your friends are dead, you have been made a refugee

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:49.360
two or three times already. You have no future in sight. And then someone comes to you and says,

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.120
I'm going to help you and I'm going to fight back on your behalf. Of course it's going to resonate.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:00.000
It's human. Right? And so I think that it's important for us to see the world through their

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:07.280
eyes rather than try to see the world through our eyes. So as Malcolm X did, you're calling for

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:13.440
highlighting the asymmetry in violence and asymmetry in moral reasoning. Absolutely.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.720
It's important. You're not going to be able to solve this problem unless you're able to do that.

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:26.640
And so when Malcolm said that if you stick a knife nine inches into my back and pull it out six

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:33.040
inches, that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound and you're not even willing to acknowledge

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:40.800
that the knife is there yet. Those that don't acknowledge what is determined now by any

01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.800
international human rights organization, even Israeli human rights organization,

01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:50.960
Betislam and others, to be apartheid, a state of apartheid and a state of occupation,

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:59.440
and now an unfolding genocide, are not partners for peace.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:08.480
It just hurts me to think how long it takes to heal.

01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:19.520
Even if the healing begins now with a knife metaphor, it's just going to be generations

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:28.080
because people don't forget when your father and mother were murdered or somebody that you know

01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:37.920
in your family was killed. They don't forget. Look, I think the point is that we have to come

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:47.840
to terms with the fact that the trauma of the past does not justify the murder of the present

01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:52.560
and the fear of the future does not justify the murder of the present.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.480
The urgency of the world right now should be entirely focused on

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:02.160
ending this atrocity that unfortunately the world has become so complacent with.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:09.360
Again, prior to October 7th, this status quo was not acceptable and there was no

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:17.360
means in sight in the global arena to rein this in, to make Israel more accountable, to stop this.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:28.560
I do believe in the power of healing. I do believe in the power of growth. I do believe

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:36.320
that we have seen ugly episodes of history before that have been rectified. I also believe in the

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:42.640
heart of my people. I believe that the Palestinian people are people of resistance. They're people

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:49.680
of resilience. They're people of courage and they're people of benevolence and magnanimity

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.360
and they're people who have been made to grow under the worst of circumstances.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:05.600
I don't see in the hearts of young Palestinians that have been tormented. I don't see darkness.

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:13.520
I see light. I see the ability to still laugh and find joy despite everything that's happened.

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.200
I think that the urgency right now just has to be towards ensuring that they have a life,

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.120
that they're not being killed anymore.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:27.760
I was wondering if you can comment on an idea and a notion that comes up

01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:38.000
often in conversations about this of why can't other nations in the region take in

01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.240
Palestinian refugees? I think that we have to tackle what's implied by that

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:51.840
at multiple levels. I actually want to walk back. I was listening to Nikki Haley when she

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.440
said in one of her interviews, and why is it that you think no one wants to take the Palestinians

01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:05.920
in and she had this deeply disturbing laugh to it? Or Ben Shapiro when he said,

01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:10.640
Israelis like to build and Arabs like to bomb crap and live in their sewage.

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:17.360
Why is it that no one wants to govern the Palestinians? Suggesting that Palestinians are

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:26.160
ungovernable and not fit to bring into your countries and that's why they're being turned

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:32.880
away. You know who else faced that bigotry? Jews trying to escape the Holocaust. 1939,

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:40.480
300,000 Germans applied for refuge here in the United States. I think only about 10,000

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:48.880
were allowed in. We also turned away ships of Jews that were seeking refuge here in the United States

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:56.560
on what basis that they were a national security threat and could not be trusted.

01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:02.560
They could not be taken in. That's the same bigotry that's driving this. I want you to

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:09.280
think about it from that perspective, how deeply offensive that is. When you have millions of

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.160
Palestinians in diaspora, where have Palestinians caused trouble where they've gone? Everywhere

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:22.800
Palestinians are, they have overcome significant hurdles to become scientists and doctors

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:28.800
and to grow themselves and to grow the places that they're in. Where have Palestinians

01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.360
that have been displaced all over the world caused issues for people? It's both racist

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:42.080
and factually incorrect. That's not the right question that should be asked. The question

01:46:42.080 --> 01:46:47.120
that should be asked are why are these people driven from their homes, not why won't other

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.920
people around them open their homes to them? I'll just share with you that even on a personal level,

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.680
you know, it's really interesting because sometimes on Twitter or wherever it is,

01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.800
it'll be like, go back home, right? Why don't you go back home? I'm sitting there thinking to myself

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:12.800
like, sure, you know, my parents were driven from their homes. Yeah, sure. I was born in this country

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:22.800
as a consequence of bad policy. Now, I embrace my complicated identity in that regard,

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.680
and I hope to be productive as an American, but I am a Palestinian and Palestinians in diaspora

01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:36.400
that have been fortunate enough to have the ability to build and to overcome circumstances

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.320
should not be an excuse for eliminating the Palestinians that remain in their homes under

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:48.800
that torment. So, this bigotry is not new. Unfortunately, its manifestation is ugly,

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:56.640
and, you know, we have to push back on it whenever it shows itself, no matter who it's being

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.600
spoken about. How difficult has it been for people in Gaza to flee?

01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.680
I mean, they're blockaded from all directions. There is nowhere for people in Gaza to go.

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:15.520
They cannot get out. And, you know, the reality is that they don't want to leave.

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:23.600
They do not want to leave. The Palestinian people want to live in their land and their homes

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:33.440
and to continue to produce, you know, an extension of the beautiful culture and legacy that was

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.000
handed to them. They don't want to leave. In fact, those that have fled for whatever reason,

01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.960
or have been able to get out for medical treatment or because they have some sort of citizenship

01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:49.360
in other countries, all they're talking about is going back and rebuilding. You can't bomb

01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:56.560
Palestine out of our hearts. You cannot starve Palestine out of our hearts. I think that's a

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:04.480
critical mistake that Israel is making. And it thinks that if it destroys Gaza enough, if it

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.920
wipes out all the buildings, that people will never want to come back. We don't want to go

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:16.400
anywhere as a Palestinian people, you know, in a way that would remove us from our homes.

01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:19.440
The Palestinian people are proud people.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.360
Yeah, you've met a lot of them, right? When you sat with Muhammad al-Qurdu people in East Jerusalem,

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:31.840
what those people have been subjected to, you know, the harassment. Like think about the

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.240
tenacity and the character that it takes to still try to walk back into your home

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.040
after an intruder has been brought in by the state that's sitting in your living room

01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:49.600
that is pushing you around and you're saying, I'm not leaving my home. This is literally what's

01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:57.200
been happening in East Jerusalem. And we're not going anywhere. I think those of us that are in

01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:04.720
diaspora, Palestine is not leaving our hearts. And those of us that are still there are not leaving

01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.400
their land. And the world has to make the occupier more accountable, not tell the occupied how to

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:17.840
cope. Do you ever imagine that if your family did not flee and you were now living in,

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.200
in say in Gaza, what you would be doing?

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:34.880
I think about what could have been all the time. You know, I actually mentioned this in the first

01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:41.120
DC protest that I remember getting a notification, a news notification

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:48.480
just prior to October with my name in it. You know, so I always get these notifications,

01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:53.440
right? If my name is mentioned in an article. And so, oh, your name is mentioned in an article.

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.040
And it was a 16 year old, Omar Suleiman, who was murdered in the West Bank.

01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:04.080
He literally had my name. I held up his picture and I realized that could have been me.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:14.640
So, I think of why God chose me to not be there and hopefully him choosing

01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.960
all of us that are not there to be for those that are still there, to be their voices. I'm grateful

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:30.880
and I'm also in pain. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to speak on their behalf,

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:40.560
but I'm also guilty that they have to bear the brunt of this evil hatred that unfortunately

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:45.600
displaced our parents in the first place. You mentioned that Palestinians invoke

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:51.280
the plight of indigenous people like Native Americans. What works and doesn't work about

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:56.960
this analogy? So, I think that there's a powerful connection between the Palestinian people and

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:04.240
the indigenous in this land and in other places that have been wronged. We are living here in

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:11.200
the United States on stolen lands that is drenched in the blood of the natives and that was built

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:19.920
upon with the blood, sweat, and labor of enslaved Africans that were brought from overseas. It's a

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:27.600
great evil that we have to reckon with constantly. So, I think that's the power of solidarity and

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:34.800
if you look in Canada and you look in places like Australia, there has been a refocus on the crimes

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:41.440
against the indigenous of those places. I think that what makes the Palestinian plight

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:53.040
deeply painful and maybe where the analogy even doesn't do justice is that from the river to the

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:59.920
sea is less than 500 times what the United States is in terms of land. It's not that big of a piece

01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:08.000
of land. And so, the original lie was a land without a people for a people without a land.

01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:14.880
And the problem was that there were people on that land that were forcibly removed. So,

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:22.320
I think that the sheer size, we're talking about a tiny piece of land and a lot of people that were

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:29.440
removed forcibly from their land and that continue to be brutalized under those

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:31.600
miserable conditions.

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.480
Why is Palestine a special place, a holy land?

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:46.320
It's the land of prophets. It is a land that holds deep significance, obviously, to

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:53.520
Jews, Christians, and Muslims. It's the land of Abraham, peace be upon him. It is the land

01:53:54.160 --> 01:54:00.880
that has such a rich history to it that connects multiple peoples in multiple ways. It's precious.

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:08.320
I think that history, while it tells the story of tragedy and struggle over that piece of land,

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.720
also tells a beautiful story of sanctity.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:20.000
So, you mentioned Abraham, prophets. Prophet Muhammad is deeply venerated in Islam, obviously,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.400
but other prophets are as well, Jesus being one of them.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.920
What are the similarities and differences in the teachings from these two prophets?

01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:41.520
Well, Islam refers to this idea of submission to one God and attaining peace in the process

01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:48.480
and refers to the way of life that prophets have all come with, which is this idea of

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.560
monotheism and serving that one God in the way that he commands you to serve him.

01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:02.080
To us, as it says in the Quran that we do not distinguish between the prophets,

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:07.200
all of the prophets came with one message, one mission. There's a coherence in the creed.

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:14.720
There's a beauty in the foundation of what would become the legislation of each of those prophets,

01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:19.200
and we see them all as siblings in prophethood.

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:24.560
We say Abraham, peace be upon him. We say Jesus, peace be upon him. We say Moses,

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.600
peace be upon him. We say Muhammad, peace be upon him. We believe that Moses came to confirm

01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.920
what came from Abraham. Jesus came to confirm what came from Moses. Muhammad came to confirm

01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.520
what came from Jesus. They upheld the same message. God did not change over time,

01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:48.320
nor did the centrality of his message of monotheism change over time. To us, it's one

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:53.120
beautiful house. There's a saying from the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, where he describes

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:58.160
the house of prophethood, each prophet being a brick and him simply being the last brick

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:04.320
of a beautiful house. We love the prophets of God, and we believe that they each came

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.440
with the legislation that was necessary for the time, but with the same message.

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:14.800
So the message is fundamentally the same. Is there a difference in emphasis?

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.560
For example, the emphasis on love for Jesus?

01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.880
Yeah, it's like when you talk about MLK and Malcolm to an extent,

01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.200
except there was actually some difference between MLK and Malcolm. I just think that

01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:35.840
the difference is exaggerated between them. I don't think that Moses didn't emphasize love,

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:39.760
but Jesus emphasized love, and then Muhammad didn't emphasize love, peace be upon them all.

01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:48.800
I think that they each emphasized the same attributes and names of God and ways of knowing

01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:55.760
God. But there were, of course, changes within legislation, changes within the divine law,

01:56:56.320 --> 01:57:03.040
but the divine spirit remained the same. So I don't see them as being counter to each other,

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:10.320
nor do I see that any prophet betrayed the message that came before them. I think they're all part

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:17.520
of the same beautiful message that we have to be at harmony with our creator and that we turn

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:26.320
towards him for our guidance, and that when we do so, we establish a greater existence here on

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:30.160
earth. And so I think that that's something that's consistent throughout the message of all the

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:38.080
prophets. You have been longtime friends with and had amazing conversations with people of other

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:49.360
faiths, Christian, Jewish. How has the events of October 7th and the days after affected this

01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:53.680
in the United States, your ability to have interfaith conversations,

01:57:54.800 --> 01:58:01.840
connections, relationships, friendships? Complicated, very complicated. And it's not

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:07.600
just Muslims and Jews. It's also Christian Zionists. Christian Zionism is at the root of

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:13.680
the problem, in my opinion, especially when we talk about what drives America's unshakable,

01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:22.640
unconditional commitment to Israel. It's devastating, I think, to Palestinian Christians

01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:29.280
in particular when Israel can bomb some of the oldest churches of Christianity in Gaza

01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:34.720
and kill Palestinian Christians. And Palestinian Christians are barred from going to the Holy

01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:41.600
Suplica or to their places of worship in Bethlehem or Jerusalem. And Christians here in the United

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:49.120
States turn their back on them. I think that it is particularly outrageous. So it's complicated.

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:58.640
Look, I expect more from people in the face of a genocide. We don't have to agree on all the

01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:06.560
particulars, but we can agree that what is happening is morally outrageous. And so I think that

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.360
I've had a few people that have reached out and said, I want to say something, but I can't.

01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:20.560
And I've had to respond with, that's not good enough. So I think that we have a problem.

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:26.480
And instead of focusing on that problem, I'd like to focus on the more morally consistent voices

01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:30.880
across faiths that have risen to the moment rather than those that have failed.

01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.880
So you wish more rabbis would be able to have a conversation like we're having today

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:45.360
and also not allow it to be seen as them turning their back on their religion?

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:54.640
Rabbis, pastors, again, it's not just Jewish leadership. It's also Christian leadership.

01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:00.640
I think that it's important for those that have claimed to be allies in the fight against

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:06.480
Islamophobia to see that you cannot be opposed to Islamophobia while also extending anti-Palestinian

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:13.360
bigotry. Yeah, one of the things since we last spoke, I've gotten to meet a lot of Palestinian

02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:19.760
Christians, including in West Bank. And that was fascinating. And those are beautiful people.

02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:27.040
I think people should watch Reverend Andres Haak's sermon on Christmas, Jesus and the Rebel.

02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:35.760
It was deeply profound. I had a chance to speak to Mitri Raheb from the Lutheran Church there as

02:00:35.760 --> 02:00:43.360
well. No, they're devastated. It was eye-opening to many people here when Justin Amish, who was a

02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.920
Republican congressman, Palestinian Christian Republican congressman, posted about his own

02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:56.560
family dying in one of the church bombings. So it's strange. Strange times. And I think

02:00:56.560 --> 02:01:05.440
that it shows that the philosophy of hate that drives this terrible policy

02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:12.800
is secular at its root and not religious. One of the criticisms of Islam

02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:21.680
points to specific verses of the Quran and the criticism being that it is not a religion of peace.

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:30.320
Can you speak to that? So objectively speaking, if you were to take the verses of the Quran

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:37.840
about violence and compare them just from a purely percentage-based comparison to the New

02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:43.600
Testament and the Old Testament, you would find less verses about war in the Quran than the Old

02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.040
Testament or the New Testament. And there are plenty of studies to speak to that. Deeper than

02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:54.960
that, contextualizing the birth of Islam, the revelation of the Quran, which was over 23 years,

02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:01.280
in response to deep persecution of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, makes it very clear

02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.720
that none of those verses are what they've been made out to be. If Muslims believed that they had

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:14.480
to kill people wherever they are, mankind would not exist. There are two billion of us. If we

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:20.720
believe that we were called by the Quran to hurt people and to kill people simply for being

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:30.080
non-believers, it would not make for a sustainable world. So Islam is not violent. And I think that

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:38.160
the history of Muslims also bears witness to that. The history of Islam is a history of contribution,

02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:45.280
is a history of building, is a history of medicine and science and math.

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:53.680
And of course, Muslims have sometimes fallen short of Islamic standards in the past and in the

02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:58.960
present. But if you look at the overall history of Islam and the history of the Muslim community,

02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:06.080
that's not the case. And when you look at the present Muslim community around the world,

02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:13.200
Muslims do not account for a greater proportion of violence than other faith communities. And again,

02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:21.120
the word terrorist is a functionless and meaningless word because to me, it's no less violent

02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:27.760
if it's commanded by a head of state or by a government than by a non-state actor. So

02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:32.320
Muslims do not account for a greater portion of violence now nor have they accounted for a greater

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.560
portion of violence in the past. What do you think these narratives have taken hold in present

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:41.280
discourse, at least in the United States? Because they allow for greater violence against

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.240
the Muslim community domestically and abroad. The United States has launched wars against primarily

02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:52.400
Muslim countries and has a particularly violent foreign policy towards the Muslim world.

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:58.960
And the Muslim community here in the United States has dealt with, unfortunately, multiple

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:05.920
aggressive iterations of programs of suppression and surveillance under

02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:11.440
Republican and Democratic administrations. And so there's a convenience to that Islamophobia.

02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:16.240
There's a convenience to that framing of the Muslim community that also distracts from other

02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:22.080
forms of violence that are deeply pervasive and present, including the ones that are committed

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:30.000
by the government itself. If it's okay, you've mentioned Al-Aqsa mosque a couple of times.

02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:36.800
I would love it if you can describe why it is such an important place, a holy place

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:44.320
for Muslims in general, but also for this particular crisis that we have been speaking about today.

02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:50.160
So Muslims honor the history of all of the prophets, right? So all of the prophets that

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:56.480
have walked in that place, all of the prophets that have worshipped in that place, all of that

02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:04.560
makes it sacred, right? So it's not separated for Muslims from post-Muhammad, peace be upon him,

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:10.560
versus prior to Muhammad, peace be upon him, in terms of the sanctity of that place. So we

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:17.600
honor it. And Masjid Al-Aqsa in particular is the place where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:23.520
him, leads the other prophets in prayer in the night of what's known as the night journey of

02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:28.000
the Prophet, peace be upon him, and then he ascends to the heavens and back. And it's also

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.920
the first Qibla, which is the first place of direction of prayer for us. So before Muslims

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:40.480
faced Mecca in prayer for the first half of Islam, they actually faced towards Jerusalem

02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:45.040
in their prayer. It was our direction of prayer and it remained a fundamental part of our faith,

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:52.720
a fundamental holy sanctuary. There are three sanctuaries in Islam, Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem,

02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:58.560
and Masjid Al-Aqsa is precious to us. And so you can imagine then the pain of watching

02:05:59.360 --> 02:06:06.400
innocent Palestinian worshippers being stomped on by Israeli soldiers or skunk water being sprayed

02:06:06.400 --> 02:06:13.360
on people as they're trying to walk in or tear gassing taking place in the nights of Ramadan

02:06:14.160 --> 02:06:19.520
in that place, the restrictions on people that live right next to it and that cannot pray in it

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:23.840
due to the certain classification of Palestinian that they've been given

02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:29.600
or the age, right? Because generally speaking, if you're younger, you're not allowed to go to

02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:35.840
Masjid Al-Aqsa even if you live within the occupied territories. So it's tough to watch

02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:43.920
such a sacred place with such an ugly occupation. But I'll also say this, that the sanctity of a

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:49.680
human being, the sanctity of just one person is greater than the sanctity of any place of worship

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:56.080
to us. So the sanctity of one individual in Gaza or one individual in Jerusalem is greater to us

02:06:56.080 --> 02:07:00.400
than the sanctity of a place of worship, but it is all certainly interconnected.

02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:09.040
That's a really powerful idea. The value of a human being is greater than even the Al-Aqsa mosque.

02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:14.240
That's a foundational idea for Islam.

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:20.000
The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says to the Kaaba itself

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:29.520
that the value of a believer's dignity and honor is greater than the value of the structure itself.

02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:36.640
And so when I see a person in Gaza aggressed upon, when I see one walid dahduh, when I see

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:43.760
one child, that's greater to me than even Al-Aqsa. But Al-Aqsa is at the heart of who we are

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:52.480
as well. And it's certainly at the heart of the Palestinian cause. It's a place of prophets,

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:55.520
and it's a place that should be treated prophetically.

02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:01.760
You mentioned to me that since October 7th, a lot of young people in the United States,

02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:07.680
and in general, have been showing interest in Islam. First of all, can you explain what you've

02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:11.200
been seeing and experiencing in terms of that trend?

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:19.040
Yeah, we have Qur'an TikTok trends where you had a few people that went on camera and said,

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:21.520
you know, I'm reading the Qur'an for the first time. And I think that that's

02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:26.640
and I think that that's the beauty of the faith of the people of Gaza, the beauty of their

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:34.560
resilience. When you're looking at these people living what's hell on earth, but they're seeking

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.240
paradise outside and they're able to still be inspired towards words of faith and determination

02:08:40.240 --> 02:08:45.520
and certainty, you're like, what is their secret? What are they reading? What are they on that

02:08:45.600 --> 02:08:54.080
allows them to still face this brutality with such grace? I mean, they're not shouting profanities,

02:08:54.080 --> 02:09:03.920
they're not shouting words of emptiness or despair, but rather they are pouring out their hearts that

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:08.800
are full of faith for the world to see. And I think that a lot of people have seen that and said,

02:09:08.800 --> 02:09:13.120
what is that? And so, you know, we've had multiple people come to the mosque.

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.280
I've never seen more people become Muslim in my life, but not just that, but gain an appreciation

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.600
for Islam. Like what type of an engineering is there, you know, that allows for people to

02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:32.000
have that type of faith? So people are opening the Qur'an for the first time. People are asking

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:39.040
questions about Islam in a way that shows that they're inspired, even though they're heartbroken

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:45.840
by what they're seeing. What's a good way to get introduced to Islam, the faith, the

02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:52.560
spiritual experience of it? Well, I think, look, you go to, you know,

02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:59.520
our websites, you go to yislam.org, you go to, you come to Yaqeen's website, yaqeenis2.org,

02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:06.160
you go to multiple Islamic websites to get those questions answered. But there's nothing like

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.520
going to a mosque. There's nothing like actually going to a mosque and meeting Muslims and asking

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:20.960
questions. And I tell people, like, you have to step out of your comfort zone and go there

02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:28.080
and let your world be complicated a bit. Experience it, listen to the sermon, meet people from

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:34.320
different backgrounds and ask questions. Muslims love to be asked, by the way, about their faith

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.240
because they're so sick of hearing other people talk about it. So Muslims love to be asked about

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:42.960
their faith. Palestinians love to be asked about Palestine because they're so sick of other people

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:49.680
talking about it. So ask questions and you will have them answered. But there's nothing like a

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:55.120
physical connection. There's nothing like a human connection. So definitely try to reach out to your

02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:00.720
local Islamic organizations and meet people. How difficult is it to convert to Islam?

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:02.480
Takes 20 seconds, man.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:08.320
What's involved? Simple enough.

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:14.480
You testify to the one. There's no pool. There's no baptism. I often joke with people. I'm like,

02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:16.640
all right, we got the pool in the back. We're going to do the baptism now.

02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:27.040
It's literally testifying to the oneness of God and testifying that Muhammad is his final messenger.

02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:33.760
That's called the Shahadah. When you testify to the oneness of God and to the prophet Muhammad,

02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:38.720
peace be upon him, being his final prophet, you are accepting what's known as the six

02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.920
articles of faith. Six articles of faith are belief in one God, belief in the angels,

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:49.840
belief in the messengers. So you can't be a Muslim without believing in Jesus or Moses or Abraham

02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:59.600
or Muhammad to believe in the messages that God has spoken to humanity through divine revelation.

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:08.400
The Quran being the last revelation to believe in the day of judgment and to believe in divine

02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:13.280
decree and predestination. So those are six articles of faith. So when you testify

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:19.120
to the oneness of God and to the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, being the final messenger,

02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:23.520
that's called the Shahadah. You embrace the package of those articles of faith. That's

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:30.720
the implication. Then you learn the prayers, learn to fast in Ramadan. You give what's known

02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:37.280
as Zakah, the mandatory charity, 2.5% of your retained earnings and Hajj, which is the pilgrimage

02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:44.480
to Mecca if you can. So that's the growth part, the journey. Once a person takes the testimony,

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:51.840
they then grow. It's really interesting because we always have those people that convert to Islam

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:56.480
like a week before Ramadan or even a day before Ramadan. So you're Muslim and you've got to fast

02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.360
the next day and that's always a challenging experience for people, but a fulfilling experience

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:10.720
for many people when they embrace Islam at that point. And again, it's simple and I think that

02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:16.800
the beauty of Islam to many people is in its simplicity. One God, one humanity, one body of

02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:29.760
prophets and one community. Because for you as a Palestinian American this year, the Ramadan

02:13:31.840 --> 02:13:37.760
perhaps would be especially difficult spiritually. What

02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:45.760
are you anticipating? What do you think is the difference this year?

02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:55.760
I hope and pray that we have a ceasefire before Ramadan. I hope that at that point we're

02:13:55.760 --> 02:14:06.320
rebuilding Gaza, talking about rebuilding Gaza and helping people that have been damaged in so

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:15.680
many different ways. I hope that Ramadan is turning a corner. Every Ramadan the aggression

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:20.560
against the Palestinian people seems to grow. So we're usually dealing with the last 10 nights

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:28.240
of Ramadan and then the incursions on Masjid al-Aqsa really sour it for the entire Muslim world.

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.480
Because you're watching worshipers being assaulted in one of the holiest places in the world and at

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:38.960
the same time you're trying to find your deep connection, your own deep holy connection

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:44.240
in Ramadan. This time we're going in and if this is still ongoing,

02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:51.520
we're dealing with a continued genocide. So I think that the mood has been somber in the

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:56.560
community. The mood has been different from anything I've ever seen before. So I anticipate

02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:01.360
this Ramadan would be different from anything we've ever seen before. I think the focus will

02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:09.760
continue to be on Gaza and on either stopping the aggression on Gaza or beginning the rebuilding

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:18.720
of Gaza. So the general heaviness permeates just your prayers and your thoughts throughout this?

02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:23.840
Yeah. I mean, look, every sermon I've given since October 7th has had to have some

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.200
inclusion of this because it's what's on everyone's hearts and minds.

02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:35.120
We also have people in our communities that have lost 20, 30, 40 people in our midst.

02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:44.160
It's not the same. If we start to have refugees or people that escape for medical treatment

02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.120
or that are able to get out through Egypt and join their families,

02:15:50.880 --> 02:15:54.320
it's becoming more real. It's becoming more personal for people.

02:15:55.280 --> 02:16:00.160
So I think that Ramadan will surround both in terms of messaging as well as community,

02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:07.120
the pain of the moment with a prayer for hope and healing.

02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:12.960
Not to put you on the spot, but in your sermons, in your private life,

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:19.040
what is the passage in the Quran that is one you find yourself returning to often?

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:27.600
Hmm. You know, the part of the Quran I get asked this question that resonates with me

02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:33.120
most usually has to do with what is heaviest for me at the moment.

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.840
There's a verse in the chapter of Mary, a part of the verse,

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:47.840
Your Lord does not forget. Your Lord does not forget. And so

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:58.320
as you see what's transpiring right now, our hope is not in creation. Our hope is in our creator

02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.840
and our hope is not in this life. Our hope is in the afterlife.

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:09.520
And so that verse deeply resonates because I think that, you know, many of us

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:14.240
often wonder how are they going to rebuild? How are they going to get past this?

02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:19.360
And we know that God has a way of restoring everything.

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:24.320
God will restore everything. If not in this life, then in the next.

02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:33.440
So there's an eternal flame of hope that burns there.

02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:42.480
Yeah. And the people of Gaza have it. You know, you can be more easily deluded by this material

02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:52.560
world if you're hostage to it, but the people of Gaza have never been deluded by the material

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:58.080
world because they never really had it. They've always been attached to a greater idea,

02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:06.720
to a greater place. And so it is part of the secret ingredient that they have, right? That

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:11.440
they believe in something greater than this. And so you can't survive hell on earth unless

02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:16.960
you believe in paradise outside of it. When you look far into the future, 20,

02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:24.880
30, 40 years from now, we're doing another podcast in the 80s and 90 years old.

02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.840
What do you hope to see in the Middle East? What do you hope to see change in the Middle East,

02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:40.720
in the United States as a people, as a set of policies, cultures, nations?

02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:50.240
I think that the nation state model and nationalism are becoming so unsustainable

02:18:50.240 --> 02:18:57.520
just with the growth of refugee populations, desperate refugee populations,

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:05.200
the rise of, unfortunately, fanaticism and fascism in different parts of the world,

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:14.880
the climate and all that that presents to us in terms of displacement. We're going to have to

02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:21.440
figure out how to function as a world rather than as nations and states. We're going to have to

02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:31.840
figure out how to not see everyone outside of our borders as threats and people that are different

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:37.840
from us within our borders as threats. We're going to have to start seeing people as people.

02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:45.520
My hope would be that we would have made people uncomfortable enough to transcend

02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:50.800
some of the barriers in their hearts and some of the barriers that we have in the world that don't

02:19:50.800 --> 02:20:00.560
allow us to see other people as people. That drives horrific policies towards people that

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:04.960
are so distant from us. You have been fearless in walking through the fire.

02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:14.640
What gives you strength psychologically to keep going, to speak out, but just also maintain an

02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:20.480
optimism and a hope for the future? I don't believe that anyone gives me success or causes

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:27.920
me failure without the permission of God. I don't seek fuel from anyone else. I don't seek hope

02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:36.000
from anyone else. I believe in a creator that has a greater plan and I want to be a greater

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:42.800
part of that plan. I'm inspired by the resilience of the people of Gaza. I'm inspired by the

02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:51.680
resilience of my parents and our grandparents and Palestinians around the world that have

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:59.920
refused to succumb to their erasure, that have refused to give up.

02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.520
We have both the energy that we need and we have the examples that we need.

02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:08.880
The energy is from above. The examples are all around us.

02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:18.640
Omar, Imam, this is a huge honor to once again speak with you. I just want to say thank you,

02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:24.160
not just for this, but for many private notes you have sent me of kindness and support

02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:33.600
and love through some of the low points, as silly as they are for me personally. It's just

02:21:34.240 --> 02:21:41.600
great to be able to call you a friend and to be able to have you in my corner. I'm forever grateful

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:45.120
to you for that. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you for talking today.

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:50.320
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Omar Suleiman. To support this podcast,

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:55.280
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

02:21:55.280 --> 02:22:02.640
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long,

02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:09.520
but it bends towards justice. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:15.620
Thank you.
