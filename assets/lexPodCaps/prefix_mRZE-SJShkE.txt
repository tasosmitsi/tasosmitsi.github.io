00:00.000 --> 00:02.560
The following is a conversation with Francis Collins,

00:02.560 --> 00:06.680
director of the NIH, the National Institutes of Health,

00:06.680 --> 00:10.100
appointed and reappointed to the role by three presidents,

00:10.100 --> 00:12.900
Obama, Trump, and Biden.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.440
He oversees 27 separate institutes and centers,

00:16.440 --> 00:20.620
including NIAD, which makes him Anthony Fauci's boss.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.820
At the NIH, Francis helped launch and led

00:23.820 --> 00:27.060
a huge number of projects that pushed the frontiers

00:27.060 --> 00:29.160
of science, health, and medicine,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.860
including one of my favorites, the Brain Initiative,

00:32.860 --> 00:35.920
that seeks to map the human brain and understand

00:35.920 --> 00:39.560
how the function arises from the neural circuitry.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.200
Before the NIH, Francis led the Human Genome Project,

00:43.200 --> 00:45.780
one of the largest and most ambitious efforts

00:45.780 --> 00:47.880
in the history of science.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.680
Given all that, Francis is a humble, thoughtful, kind man,

00:52.680 --> 00:55.320
and because of this, to me, he's one of the best

00:55.320 --> 00:58.280
representatives of science in the world.

00:58.340 --> 01:01.440
He's a man of God, and yet, also a friend

01:01.440 --> 01:04.940
of the late Christopher Hitchens, who called him, quote,

01:04.940 --> 01:08.280
one of the greatest living Americans.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.340
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.380
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:12.380 --> 01:15.720
in the description, and now, here's my conversation

01:15.720 --> 01:17.420
with Francis Collins.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.320
Science at its best is a source of hope,

01:21.320 --> 01:23.500
so for me, it's been difficult to watch,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.800
as it has during the pandemic,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.200
become at times a source of division.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.920
What I would love to do in this conversation with you

01:30.920 --> 01:32.920
is touch some difficult topics,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.300
and do so with empathy and humility,

01:35.300 --> 01:39.040
so that we may begin to regain a sense of trust in science,

01:39.040 --> 01:42.000
and that it may, once again, become a source of hope.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.200
I hope that's okay with you.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.000
I love the goal.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.640
Let's start with some hard questions.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.720
You called for, quote, thorough, expert-driven,

01:50.720 --> 01:54.240
and objective inquiry into the origins of COVID-19,

01:54.240 --> 01:56.980
so let me ask, is there a reasonable chance

01:57.000 --> 01:59.300
that COVID-19 leaked from a lab?

02:00.240 --> 02:01.980
I can't exclude that.

02:01.980 --> 02:04.180
I think it's fairly unlikely.

02:04.180 --> 02:07.740
I wish we had more ability to be able to ask questions

02:07.740 --> 02:10.880
of the Chinese government, and learn more about

02:10.880 --> 02:13.380
what kind of records might have been in the lab

02:13.380 --> 02:15.660
that we've never been able to see,

02:15.660 --> 02:19.620
but most likely, this was a natural origin of a virus,

02:19.620 --> 02:21.820
probably starting in a bat, perhaps traveling

02:21.820 --> 02:25.200
through some other intermediate yet-to-be-identified host,

02:25.280 --> 02:27.560
and finding its way into humans.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.960
Is answering this question within the realm of science,

02:29.960 --> 02:32.020
do you think, will we ever know?

02:32.020 --> 02:35.700
I think we might know if we find that intermediate host,

02:35.700 --> 02:39.640
and there has not yet been a thorough enough investigation

02:39.640 --> 02:42.000
to say that that's not going to happen.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.800
And remember, it takes a while to do this.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.740
With SARS, it was 14 years before we figured out

02:47.740 --> 02:50.840
it was the civet cat that was the intermediate host.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.840
With MERS, it was a little quicker to discover

02:52.920 --> 02:54.080
that it was the camel.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.840
With SARS-CoV-2, there's been some looking,

02:56.840 --> 02:59.800
but especially now, with everything really tense

02:59.800 --> 03:02.600
between the US and China, if there's looking going on,

03:02.600 --> 03:05.000
we're not getting told about it.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.640
Do you think it's a scientific question

03:06.640 --> 03:08.320
or a political question?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.680
It's a scientific question,

03:09.680 --> 03:12.340
but it has political implications.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.560
So the world is full of scientists

03:14.560 --> 03:17.240
that are working together, but in the political space,

03:17.240 --> 03:21.360
in the political science space, there's tensions.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.840
What is it like to do great science

03:23.840 --> 03:27.880
in a time of a pandemic when there's political tensions?

03:27.880 --> 03:29.960
It's very unfortunate.

03:29.960 --> 03:34.120
Pasteur said, science knows no one country.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.820
He was right about that.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.440
My whole career, in genetics especially,

03:39.440 --> 03:42.320
has depended upon international collaboration

03:42.320 --> 03:45.520
between scientists as a way to make discoveries,

03:45.520 --> 03:46.360
get things done.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.960
Scientists, by their nature, like to be involved

03:49.960 --> 03:52.200
in international collaborations.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.760
The Human Genome Project, for heaven's sake,

03:54.760 --> 03:58.840
2,400 scientists in six countries working together,

03:58.840 --> 04:00.480
not worrying who is gonna get the credit,

04:00.480 --> 04:02.200
giving all the data away.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.880
I was the person who was supposed to keep

04:03.880 --> 04:07.080
all that coordinated, and it was a wonderful experience.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.360
And that included China.

04:08.360 --> 04:10.600
That was sort of their first real entry

04:10.600 --> 04:14.560
into a big international, big science kind of project,

04:14.560 --> 04:15.920
and they did their part.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.120
It's very different now.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.880
Continue on the line of difficult questions,

04:23.880 --> 04:26.600
especially difficult ethical questions.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.760
In 2014, US put a hold on gain-of-function research

04:30.760 --> 04:34.080
in response to a number of laboratory-by-security incidents

04:34.080 --> 04:37.020
including anthrax, smallpox, and influenza.

04:37.020 --> 04:41.440
In December 2017, NIH lifted this ban

04:41.440 --> 04:43.420
because, quote, gain-of-function research

04:43.420 --> 04:46.600
is important in helping us identify, understand,

04:46.640 --> 04:49.120
and develop strategies and effective countermeasures

04:49.120 --> 04:50.960
against rapidly evolving pathogens

04:50.960 --> 04:53.000
that pose a threat to public health.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.760
All difficult questions have arguments on both sides.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.760
Can you argue the pros and cons

04:59.760 --> 05:02.520
of gain-of-function research with viruses?

05:03.400 --> 05:04.920
I can.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.960
And first, let me say this term, gain-of-function,

05:08.960 --> 05:12.320
is causing such confusion that I need to take a minute

05:12.320 --> 05:14.120
and just sort of talk about

05:14.200 --> 05:18.000
what the common scientific use of that term is

05:18.000 --> 05:19.840
and where it is very different

05:19.840 --> 05:22.720
when we're talking about the current oversight

05:22.720 --> 05:25.360
of potentially dangerous human pathogens.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.320
As you know, in science,

05:28.320 --> 05:31.120
we're doing gain-of-function experiments all the time.

05:32.240 --> 05:36.300
We support a lot of cancer immunotherapy at NIH.

05:36.300 --> 05:38.000
Right here in our clinical center,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.040
there are trials going on where people's immune cells

05:41.040 --> 05:42.920
are taken out of their body,

05:42.960 --> 05:44.480
treated with a genetic therapy

05:44.480 --> 05:47.460
that revs up their ability to discover the cancer

05:47.460 --> 05:49.360
that that patient currently has,

05:49.360 --> 05:50.720
maybe even at stage four,

05:50.720 --> 05:52.760
and then give them back

05:52.760 --> 05:56.200
as those little ninja warriors go after the cancer.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.800
And it sometimes works dramatically.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.280
That's gain-of-function.

06:00.280 --> 06:02.880
You gave that patient a gain in their immune function

06:02.880 --> 06:04.720
that may have saved their life.

06:04.720 --> 06:06.000
So we gotta be careful not to say,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.120
oh, gain-of-function is bad.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.680
Most of what we do in science that's good

06:11.680 --> 06:14.280
involves quite a bit of the hat.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.400
And we are all living with gains-of-function every day.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
I have a gain-of-function

06:17.400 --> 06:19.340
because I'm wearing these eyeglasses.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.100
Otherwise, I would not be seeing you as clearly.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.800
I'm happy for that gain-of-function.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.880
So that's where a lot of confusion has happened.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.240
The kind of gain-of-function which is now subject to

06:31.240 --> 06:35.520
very rigorous and very carefully defined oversight

06:35.520 --> 06:38.960
is when you are working with an established human pathogen

06:39.120 --> 06:42.800
that is known to be potentially causing a pandemic,

06:42.800 --> 06:46.780
and you are enhancing or potentially enhancing

06:46.780 --> 06:50.000
its transmissibility or its virulence.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
We call that EPPP, Enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen.

06:56.420 --> 07:01.120
That requires this very stringent oversight

07:01.120 --> 07:03.560
worked out over three years

07:03.560 --> 07:08.320
by the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity

07:08.320 --> 07:11.440
that needs to be looked at by a panel

07:11.440 --> 07:13.780
that goes well beyond NIH to decide

07:13.780 --> 07:17.240
are the benefits worth the risks in that situation?

07:18.100 --> 07:21.420
Most of the time, it's not worth the risk.

07:21.420 --> 07:25.040
Only three times in the last three or four years

07:25.040 --> 07:28.400
have experiments been given permission to go forward.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.880
They were all an influenza.

07:30.860 --> 07:33.240
So I will argue that if you're worried

07:33.240 --> 07:35.680
about the next pandemic,

07:35.680 --> 07:38.000
the more you know about the coming enemy,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.120
the better chance you have to recognize

07:40.120 --> 07:42.040
when trouble is starting.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.480
And so if you can do it safely,

07:44.480 --> 07:48.920
studying influenza or coronaviruses like SARS, MERS,

07:48.920 --> 07:51.880
and SARS-CoV-2 would be a good thing

07:51.880 --> 07:53.280
to be able to know about,

07:53.280 --> 07:55.480
but you have to be able to do it safely

07:55.480 --> 07:59.240
because we all know lab accidents can happen.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.720
I mean, look at SARS where there have been lab accidents

08:02.720 --> 08:05.160
and people have gotten sick as a result.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.840
We don't want to take that chance

08:06.840 --> 08:08.880
unless there's a compelling scientific reason.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.440
That's why we have this very stringent oversight.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.080
The experiments being done

08:15.080 --> 08:17.760
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

08:17.760 --> 08:22.760
as a subaward to our grant to EcoHealth in New York

08:23.000 --> 08:24.920
did not meet that standard

08:24.920 --> 08:27.600
of requiring that kind of stringent oversight.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.240
I want to be really clear about that

08:29.240 --> 08:32.240
because there's been so much thrown around about it.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.640
Was it gain of function?

08:33.640 --> 08:36.160
Well, in the standard use of that term

08:36.160 --> 08:38.080
that you would use in science in general,

08:38.080 --> 08:39.040
you might say it was,

08:39.040 --> 08:41.800
but in the use of that term that applies

08:41.800 --> 08:46.280
to this very specific example

08:46.280 --> 08:50.240
of a potential pandemic pathogen, absolutely not.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.120
So nothing went on there that should not have happened

08:54.120 --> 08:55.880
based upon the oversight.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.000
There was an instance where the grantee institution

09:00.000 --> 09:03.040
failed to notify us about the result of an experiment

09:03.040 --> 09:04.200
that they were supposed to tell us

09:04.200 --> 09:08.080
where they mixed and matched some viral genomes

09:08.080 --> 09:11.840
and got a somewhat larger viral load as a result,

09:11.840 --> 09:14.000
but it was not EPPP.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.760
It was not getting into that zone

09:16.760 --> 09:19.320
that would have required this higher level of scrutiny.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.960
It was all bat viruses.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.800
These were not human pathogens.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.280
So they didn't cross a threshold within that gray area

09:27.280 --> 09:29.200
that makes for an EPPP?

09:29.200 --> 09:30.440
They did not.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.120
And anybody who's willing to take the time

09:33.120 --> 09:34.840
to look at what EPPP means

09:34.840 --> 09:37.120
and what those experiments were

09:37.120 --> 09:39.200
would have to agree with what I just said.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.080
What is the biggest reason it didn't cross that threshold?

09:42.080 --> 09:45.520
Is it because it wasn't jumping to humans?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.680
Is it because it did not have the sufficient increase

09:48.680 --> 09:50.080
in virulence or transmissibility?

09:50.080 --> 09:51.600
What's your sense?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.720
EPPP only applies to agents

09:54.720 --> 09:59.720
that are known human pathogens of pandemic potential.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.560
These were all bat viruses derived in the wild,

10:04.560 --> 10:07.200
not shown to be infectious to humans.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.520
Just looking at what happened

10:08.520 --> 10:10.640
if you took four different bat viruses

10:10.640 --> 10:13.480
and you tried moving the spike protein gene

10:13.480 --> 10:15.120
from one into one of the others

10:15.120 --> 10:18.960
to see whether it would bind better to the ACE2 receptor.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.080
That doesn't get across that threshold.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.320
And let me also say,

10:22.320 --> 10:25.280
for those who are trying to connect the dots here,

10:25.280 --> 10:27.280
which is the most troubling part of this,

10:27.440 --> 10:31.160
and say, well, this is how SARS-CoV-2 got started,

10:31.160 --> 10:34.720
that is absolutely demonstrably false.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.640
These bat viruses that were being studied

10:37.640 --> 10:41.320
had only about 80% similarity in their genomes

10:41.320 --> 10:42.480
to SARS-CoV-2.

10:42.480 --> 10:45.880
They were like decades away in evolutionary terms.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.640
And it is really irresponsible

10:47.640 --> 10:49.200
for people to claim otherwise.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.840
Speaking of people who claim otherwise,

10:54.840 --> 10:58.560
Rand Paul, what do you make of the battle of wars

10:58.560 --> 11:01.920
between Senator Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony Fauci

11:01.920 --> 11:03.640
over this particular point?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.280
I don't wanna talk about specific members of Congress,

11:07.280 --> 11:09.520
but I will say it's really unfortunate

11:09.520 --> 11:12.520
that Tony Fauci, who is the epitome

11:12.520 --> 11:14.880
of a dedicated public servant,

11:14.880 --> 11:19.280
has now somehow been targeted for political reasons

11:19.280 --> 11:23.520
as somebody that certain figures are trying to discredit,

11:23.520 --> 11:26.520
perhaps to try to distract from their own failings.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.360
This never should have happened.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.040
Here's a person who's dedicated his whole life

11:32.040 --> 11:35.640
to trying to prevent illnesses from infectious diseases,

11:35.640 --> 11:38.840
including HIV, in the 1980s and 90s,

11:38.840 --> 11:42.560
and now probably the most knowledgeable

11:42.560 --> 11:45.280
infectious disease physician in the world,

11:45.280 --> 11:48.280
and also a really good communicator,

11:48.280 --> 11:50.280
is out there telling the truth

11:50.280 --> 11:52.800
about where we are with SARS-CoV-2

11:52.800 --> 11:55.600
to certain political figures who don't wanna hear it

11:55.600 --> 11:58.680
and who are therefore determined to discredit him,

11:58.680 --> 12:00.440
and that is disgraceful.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.000
So with politicians, they often play games

12:03.000 --> 12:04.720
with black and white.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.720
They try to sort of use the gray areas of science

12:10.000 --> 12:12.080
and then paint their own picture,

12:12.080 --> 12:15.040
but I have a question about the gray areas of science.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.360
So like you mentioned, gain of function is a term

12:18.360 --> 12:20.720
that has very specific scientific meaning,

12:20.720 --> 12:23.320
but it also has a more general term,

12:23.320 --> 12:26.360
and it's very possible to argue that the,

12:26.360 --> 12:28.920
not to argue, not the way politicians argue,

12:28.920 --> 12:31.200
but just as human beings and scientists,

12:31.200 --> 12:34.880
that there was a gain of function achieved

12:34.880 --> 12:37.960
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

12:37.960 --> 12:39.760
but it didn't cross the threshold.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.520
I mean, there's a, it's a, but it could have too.

12:43.520 --> 12:44.560
So here's the thing,

12:44.560 --> 12:47.280
when you do these kinds of experiments,

12:47.280 --> 12:50.360
unexpected results may be achieved,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.760
and that's the gray area of science.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.200
You're taking risks with such experiments,

12:56.560 --> 13:00.960
and I am very uncomfortable that we can't discuss

13:00.960 --> 13:03.680
the uncertainty in the gray area of this.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.280
Oh, I'm comfortable discussing the gray area.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.840
What I'm uncomfortable with is people deciding

13:08.840 --> 13:12.440
to define for themselves what that threshold is

13:12.440 --> 13:14.880
based on sort of some political argument.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.760
The threshold was very explicitly laid out.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.720
Everybody agreed to that

13:20.720 --> 13:23.800
on the basis of this three years of deliberation.

13:23.800 --> 13:24.760
So that's what it is.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.240
If that threshold needs to be reconsidered,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.000
let's reconsider it,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
but let's not try to take an experiment

13:31.000 --> 13:32.480
that's already been done

13:32.480 --> 13:35.160
and decide that the threshold isn't what it was,

13:35.160 --> 13:37.680
because that really is doing a disservice

13:37.680 --> 13:38.880
to the whole process.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.160
I wish there was a discussion,

13:40.160 --> 13:43.360
even in response to Rand Paul,

13:43.360 --> 13:45.160
I know we're not talking about specific senators,

13:45.160 --> 13:48.360
but just that particular case, I'm saying stuff here.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.080
I wish there was an opportunity to talk about,

13:51.080 --> 13:52.720
given the current threshold,

13:52.720 --> 13:55.000
this is not gain of function,

13:55.000 --> 13:56.880
but maybe we need to reconsider the threshold

13:56.880 --> 13:57.720
and have an action.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.320
That's an opportunity for discussion

13:59.320 --> 14:01.200
about the ethics of gain of function.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.040
You said that there was three studies

14:03.040 --> 14:05.360
that passed that threshold with influenza.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.240
That's a fascinating human question,

14:07.240 --> 14:09.320
a scientific question about ethics,

14:09.320 --> 14:13.920
because like you said, there's pros and cons.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.720
You're taking risks here

14:15.720 --> 14:20.720
to prevent horribly destructive viruses in the future,

14:21.680 --> 14:25.000
but you also are risking creating

14:25.000 --> 14:26.880
such viruses in the future.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.200
With nuclear weapons and nuclear energy,

14:31.600 --> 14:35.040
nuclear energy promises a lot of positive effects,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.200
and yet you're taking risks here.

14:37.200 --> 14:39.840
With mutually shared destruction,

14:39.840 --> 14:41.920
nations possessing nuclear weapons.

14:41.920 --> 14:45.080
Oh my, I hope we're not going there.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.880
No, we're not, but a lot of people argue

14:47.880 --> 14:50.320
that nuclear weapons is the reason

14:50.320 --> 14:52.440
we've prevented world wars,

14:52.440 --> 14:56.560
and yet they also have the risk of starting world wars.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.280
And this is what we have to be honest about

14:59.280 --> 15:01.800
with the benefits and risks of science,

15:01.800 --> 15:04.520
that you have to make that calculation.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.240
What are the pros and what are the cons?

15:06.240 --> 15:09.400
I'm totally with you, but I want to reassure you, Lex,

15:09.400 --> 15:12.000
that this is not an issue that's been ignored.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.840
Yes.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.400
This issue about the kind of gain of function

15:15.400 --> 15:18.400
that might result in a serious human pathogen

15:18.400 --> 15:21.680
has been front and center in many deliberations

15:21.680 --> 15:23.120
for a decade or more,

15:23.120 --> 15:26.160
involved a lot of my time along the way, by the way,

15:26.160 --> 15:29.600
and has been discussed publicly on multiple occasions,

15:29.600 --> 15:31.680
including two major meetings

15:31.680 --> 15:34.240
of the National Academy of Sciences,

15:34.240 --> 15:35.840
getting input from everybody,

15:35.840 --> 15:38.560
and ultimately arriving at our current framework.

15:38.560 --> 15:43.400
Now, we actually, back in January of 2020,

15:43.400 --> 15:46.720
just before COVID-19 changed everything,

15:46.720 --> 15:48.600
had planned and even charged

15:48.600 --> 15:53.600
that same National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity

15:54.240 --> 15:56.960
to reconvene and look at the current framework

15:56.960 --> 15:58.680
and say, do we have it right?

15:58.680 --> 16:01.280
Let's look at the experience over those three years

16:01.280 --> 16:05.240
and say, is the threshold too easy, too hard?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.360
Do we need to reconsider it?

16:06.360 --> 16:07.960
Let's look at the experience.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.560
COVID came along, the members of the board said,

16:10.560 --> 16:12.400
please, we're all infectious disease experts,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.200
we don't have time for this right now,

16:14.200 --> 16:16.640
but I think the time is right to do this.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.160
I'm totally supportive of that,

16:18.160 --> 16:20.320
and that should be just as public a discussion

16:20.320 --> 16:23.040
as you can imagine about what are the benefits and the risks.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.680
And if somebody decided ultimately this came together

16:26.680 --> 16:28.800
and said, we just shouldn't be doing these experiments

16:28.800 --> 16:31.360
under any circumstances, if that was the conclusion,

16:31.360 --> 16:32.800
well, that would be the conclusion,

16:32.800 --> 16:34.220
but it hasn't been so far.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.340
If we can briefly look out into the next hundred years

16:38.340 --> 16:43.340
on this, I apologize for the existential questions,

16:44.260 --> 16:49.260
but it seems obvious to me that as gain of function

16:49.500 --> 16:54.000
type of research and development becomes easier and cheaper,

16:55.180 --> 16:58.060
it will become greater and greater risk.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.740
So if it doesn't no longer need to be contained

17:01.780 --> 17:04.940
within the laboratories of high security,

17:06.140 --> 17:08.580
it feels like this is one of the greatest threats

17:08.580 --> 17:10.540
facing human civilization.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.940
Do you worry that at some point in the future,

17:12.940 --> 17:16.080
a leaked manmade virus may destroy

17:16.080 --> 17:18.660
most of human civilization?

17:18.660 --> 17:20.700
I do worry about the risks,

17:20.700 --> 17:24.460
and at the moment where we have the greatest control,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.060
the greatest oversight,

17:26.060 --> 17:29.100
is when this is federally funded research.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.340
But as you're alluding,

17:30.340 --> 17:33.180
there's no reason to imagine that's the only place

17:33.180 --> 17:35.820
that this kind of activity would go on.

17:35.820 --> 17:40.820
If there was an evil source that wished to create a virus

17:40.860 --> 17:43.580
that was highly pathogenic in their garage,

17:43.580 --> 17:46.620
the technology does get easier.

17:46.620 --> 17:50.540
And there is no international oversight about this either

17:50.540 --> 17:52.620
that you could say has the same stringency

17:52.620 --> 17:54.940
as what we have in the United States.

17:54.940 --> 17:58.120
So yes, that is a concern.

17:58.120 --> 18:03.080
It would take a seriously deranged group or person

18:03.080 --> 18:05.520
to undertake this on purpose,

18:05.520 --> 18:08.480
given the likelihood that they too would go down.

18:08.480 --> 18:13.480
We don't imagine there are going to be bio weapons

18:13.580 --> 18:15.720
that only kill your enemies and don't kill you.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.360
Sorry, we're too much alike for that to work.

18:19.460 --> 18:23.160
So I don't see it as an imminent risk.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.640
There's lots of scary novels and movies written about it,

18:27.640 --> 18:31.000
but I do think it's something we have to consider

18:31.000 --> 18:33.020
what are all the things that ought to be watched.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.400
You may not know that if somebody is ordering

18:36.400 --> 18:41.400
a particular oligonucleotide from one of the main suppliers

18:41.960 --> 18:45.820
and it happens to match smallpox, they're going to get caught.

18:47.220 --> 18:50.280
So there is effort underway to try to track

18:50.280 --> 18:52.680
any nefarious actions that might be going on.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.120
In the United States or internationally,

18:54.120 --> 18:55.800
is there an international collaboration

18:55.800 --> 18:57.400
of try to track this stuff?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.520
There is some, I wish it were stronger.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.420
This is a general issue, Lex, in terms of

19:03.420 --> 19:05.840
do we have a mechanism, particularly when it comes

19:05.840 --> 19:09.000
to ethical issues, to be able to decide

19:09.000 --> 19:11.400
what's allowable and what's not and enforce it?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.240
I mean, look where we are with germline genome editing

19:14.240 --> 19:15.680
for humans, for instance.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.640
There is no enforcement mechanism.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.960
There's just bully pulpits and governments

19:19.960 --> 19:21.920
that get to decide for themselves.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.120
So you talked about evil.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.480
What about incompetence?

19:24.480 --> 19:25.400
Does that worry you?

19:25.400 --> 19:28.000
I was born in the Soviet Union.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.040
My dad, a physicist, worked at Chernobyl.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.480
That comes to mind.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.680
That wasn't evil.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.440
That was, I don't know what word you want to put it.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
Maybe incompetence is too harsh.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.000
Maybe it's the inherent incompetence of bureaucracy.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.840
I don't know.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.920
But for whatever reason, there was an accident.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.160
Does that worry you?

19:45.160 --> 19:46.840
Of course it does.

19:46.840 --> 19:50.240
We know that SARS, for instance, did manage to leak

19:50.240 --> 19:53.440
out of a lab in China two or three times.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.760
And at least in some instances, people died,

19:55.760 --> 19:57.600
fortunately quickly contained.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.680
All one can do in that circumstance,

20:00.680 --> 20:04.320
because you need to study the virus and understand it

20:04.320 --> 20:07.560
in order to keep it from causing a broader pandemic,

20:07.560 --> 20:11.080
but you need to insist upon the kind of biosecurity,

20:11.080 --> 20:14.080
the BSL 2, 3, and 4 framework

20:14.080 --> 20:17.080
under which those experiments have to be done.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.640
And certainly at NIH, we're extremely rigorous about that,

20:20.680 --> 20:23.640
but you can't count on every human being

20:23.640 --> 20:26.200
to always do exactly what they're supposed to.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.560
So there's a risk there, which is another reason

20:28.560 --> 20:32.000
why if we're contemplating supporting research

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
on pathogens that might be the next pandemic,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.480
you have to factor that in, not just whether people

20:37.480 --> 20:40.520
are gonna do something that we couldn't have predicted

20:40.520 --> 20:42.280
where all of a sudden they created a virus,

20:42.280 --> 20:44.280
it's much worse without knowing they were gonna do that,

20:44.280 --> 20:46.400
but also just having an accident.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.960
That's in the mix when those estimates are done

20:49.960 --> 20:52.120
about whether the risk is worth it or not.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.320
Continuing on line of difficult questions.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.960
We're gonna get to fun stuff after a while.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.840
We will soon, I promise.

21:04.560 --> 21:06.880
You are the director of the NIH.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.640
You are Dr. Anthony Fauci's, technically his boss.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.480
You have stood behind him.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.120
You have supported him,

21:16.120 --> 21:18.600
just like you did already in this conversation.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.960
It is painful for me to see division and distrust,

21:21.960 --> 21:25.280
but many people in politics and elsewhere

21:25.280 --> 21:28.000
have called for Anthony Fauci to be fired.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.320
When there's such calls of distrust in public

21:31.320 --> 21:34.600
about a leader like Anthony Fauci who should garner trust,

21:34.600 --> 21:37.720
do you think he should be fired?

21:37.720 --> 21:39.040
Absolutely not.

21:40.480 --> 21:45.480
To do so would be basically to give the opportunity

21:46.160 --> 21:50.320
for those who wanna make up stories about anybody

21:50.320 --> 21:51.600
to destroy them.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.160
There is nothing in the ways in which Tony Fauci

21:55.160 --> 21:58.520
has been targeted that is based upon truth.

21:59.880 --> 22:04.720
How could we then accept those cries for his firing

22:04.720 --> 22:06.160
as having legitimacy?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.320
It's a circular argument.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.520
They've decided they don't like Tony,

22:10.520 --> 22:13.600
so they make up stuff and they twist comments

22:13.600 --> 22:16.000
that he's made about things like gain of function,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.480
where he's referring to the very specific gain of function

22:19.480 --> 22:21.560
that's covered by this policy,

22:21.560 --> 22:24.400
and they're trying to say he lied to the Congress.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.320
That's simply not true.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.960
They don't like the fact that Tony changes

22:28.960 --> 22:33.280
the medical recommendations about what to do with COVID-19

22:33.280 --> 22:35.680
over the space of more than a year,

22:35.680 --> 22:36.960
and they call that flip-flopping,

22:36.960 --> 22:37.960
and you can't trust the guy

22:37.960 --> 22:40.360
because he says one thing last year and one thing this year.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.680
Well, the science has changed.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.880
Delta variant has changed everything.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.120
You don't want him to be saying the same thing

22:47.120 --> 22:48.080
he did a year ago.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.080
That would be wrong now.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.560
It was the best we could do then.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.040
People don't understand that

22:52.040 --> 22:54.840
or else they don't want to understand that.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.640
So when you basically whip up a largely political argument

22:59.640 --> 23:03.320
against a scientist and hammer at it over and over again

23:03.320 --> 23:06.680
to the point where he now has to have 24-7 security

23:06.680 --> 23:08.160
to protect him against people

23:08.160 --> 23:10.600
who really want to do violence to him,

23:10.600 --> 23:13.560
for that to be a reason to say that then he should be fired

23:13.560 --> 23:17.040
is to hand the evil forces the victory.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.280
I will not do that.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.640
Yet there's something difficult

23:23.640 --> 23:26.200
I'm going to try to express to you.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.760
So it may be your guitar playing.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.600
It may be something else, but there's a humility to you.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.320
It may be because you're a man of God.

23:36.320 --> 23:37.840
There's a humility to you

23:38.840 --> 23:42.000
that garners trust.

23:44.560 --> 23:48.840
And when you're in a leadership position representing science,

23:48.840 --> 23:52.200
especially in catastrophic events like the pandemic,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.160
it feels like as a leader,

23:55.160 --> 24:00.160
you have to go far above and beyond your usual duties.

24:00.880 --> 24:04.120
And I think there's no question that Anthony Fauci

24:04.120 --> 24:06.560
has delivered on his duties.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.800
But it feels like he needs to go above

24:09.800 --> 24:11.120
as a science communicator.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.360
And if there's a large number of people

24:13.360 --> 24:15.280
that are distrusting him,

24:17.640 --> 24:20.800
it's also his responsibility to garner their trust,

24:20.800 --> 24:22.040
to gain their trust.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.880
As a person who's the face of science,

24:26.880 --> 24:28.200
are you torn on this?

24:28.200 --> 24:31.360
The responsibility of Anthony Fauci of yourself

24:31.360 --> 24:33.640
to represent science,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.360
not just the communication of advising

24:37.200 --> 24:38.040
or what should be done,

24:38.040 --> 24:40.880
but giving people hope,

24:40.880 --> 24:45.440
giving people trust in science and alleviating division.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.080
Do you think that's also responsibility of a leader

24:48.080 --> 24:49.520
or is that unfair to ask?

24:50.680 --> 24:52.680
I think the best way you give people trust

24:52.680 --> 24:54.320
is to tell them the truth.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.600
And so they recognize that when you're sharing information,

24:57.600 --> 24:59.360
it's the best you've got at that point.

24:59.360 --> 25:02.920
And Tony Fauci does that at every moment.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.360
I don't think him expressing more humility

25:06.360 --> 25:09.200
would change the fact that they're looking for a target

25:09.200 --> 25:11.280
of somebody to blame,

25:11.280 --> 25:13.480
to basically distract people

25:13.480 --> 25:16.800
from the failings of their own political party.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.760
Maybe I'm less targeted,

25:18.760 --> 25:20.720
not because of a difference in,

25:20.720 --> 25:23.080
oh, the way in which I convey the information,

25:23.080 --> 25:24.840
I'm less visible.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.880
If Tony were out of the scene

25:26.880 --> 25:28.720
and I was placed in that role,

25:28.760 --> 25:31.720
I'd probably be seeing a ratcheting up

25:31.720 --> 25:33.040
of that same targeting.

25:34.520 --> 25:39.520
I would like to believe that if Tony Fauci said

25:40.320 --> 25:42.720
that when I originally made recommendations

25:42.720 --> 25:44.640
not to wear masks,

25:44.640 --> 25:47.840
that was given on our best available data,

25:47.840 --> 25:50.480
and now we know that is a mistake.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.080
So admit with humility that there's an error.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.960
That's not actually correct,

25:56.960 --> 25:59.960
but that's a statement of humility.

25:59.960 --> 26:04.400
And I would like to believe despite the attacks,

26:04.400 --> 26:07.040
he would win a lot of people over with that.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.120
So a lot of people, as you're saying,

26:09.120 --> 26:11.880
would use that C, that here we go,

26:11.880 --> 26:15.200
here's that Dr. Anthony Fauci making mistakes.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.840
How can we trust him on anything?

26:16.840 --> 26:21.840
I believe if he was that public display of humility

26:22.840 --> 26:25.160
to say that I made an error,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.120
that would win a lot of people over.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.040
That's kind of my sense.

26:32.040 --> 26:35.040
To face the fire of the attacks from politics,

26:35.040 --> 26:37.960
like politicians will attack no matter what,

26:37.960 --> 26:40.680
but the question is the people,

26:40.680 --> 26:41.960
to win over the people.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.440
The biggest concern I've had is that there is this

26:46.520 --> 26:49.600
distress of science that's been brewing.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.040
And maybe you can correct me,

26:52.040 --> 26:53.440
but I'm a little bit unwilling

26:53.440 --> 26:55.960
to fully blame the politicians

26:55.960 --> 26:58.680
because politicians play their games no matter what.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.840
It just feels like this was an opportunity

27:02.840 --> 27:05.360
to inspire people with the power of science.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.560
The development of the vaccines,

27:07.560 --> 27:09.920
no matter what you think of those vaccines,

27:09.920 --> 27:11.520
is one of the greatest accomplishments

27:11.520 --> 27:12.680
in the history of science.

27:12.680 --> 27:13.760
It is indeed.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.160
And the fact that that's not inspiring,

27:17.160 --> 27:18.920
listen, I host a podcast.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.240
Whenever I say positive stuff about the vaccine,

27:21.240 --> 27:24.000
I get to hear a lot of different opinions.

27:24.000 --> 27:24.840
I bet you do.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.440
The fact that I do is a big problem to me

27:28.440 --> 27:30.400
because it's an incredible,

27:30.400 --> 27:33.360
an incredible accomplishment of science.

27:33.360 --> 27:38.360
And so I'm sorry, but I have to put responsibility

27:38.960 --> 27:42.440
on the leaders, even if it's not their mistakes.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.840
That's what the leadership is.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.880
That's what leadership is.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.320
You take responsibility for the situation.

27:47.320 --> 27:48.760
I wonder if there's something

27:48.760 --> 27:50.800
that could have been done better

27:51.360 --> 27:56.040
to give people hope that science will save us

27:56.040 --> 27:58.280
as opposed to science will divide us.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.440
I think you have more confidence in the ability

28:04.440 --> 28:07.600
to get beyond our current divisions than I do

28:07.600 --> 28:12.120
after seeing just how deep and dark they have become.

28:12.120 --> 28:14.720
Tony Fauci has said multiple times

28:14.720 --> 28:17.680
the recommendation about not wearing masks

28:17.680 --> 28:19.480
was for two reasons.

28:19.480 --> 28:22.440
A shortage of masks which were needed in hospitals

28:22.440 --> 28:25.880
and a lack of realization early in the course

28:25.880 --> 28:28.680
of the epidemic that this was a virus

28:28.680 --> 28:32.400
that could heavily infect asymptomatic people.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.320
Has that changed?

28:35.320 --> 28:36.520
He changed.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.640
Now, did he make an error?

28:37.640 --> 28:39.840
No, he was making a judgment based

28:39.840 --> 28:41.760
on the data available at the time,

28:41.760 --> 28:45.320
but he certainly made that clear over and over again.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.440
It has not stopped those who would like to demonize him

28:48.440 --> 28:50.440
from saying, well, he just flip-flopped.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.680
You can't trust a guy.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.920
He says one thing today and one thing tomorrow.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.360
Well, masks is a tricky one.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.200
So I'm actually-

28:59.200 --> 29:00.120
It is a tricky one.

29:00.120 --> 29:03.280
Early on, I'm a coauthor on a paper, one of many,

29:03.280 --> 29:08.280
but this was a survey paper overlooking the evidence.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.360
It's a summary of the evidence we have

29:10.360 --> 29:12.440
for the effectiveness of masks.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.680
It seems that it's difficult

29:15.680 --> 29:18.520
to do rigorous scientific study on masks.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.920
It is difficult.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.280
There's a lot of philosophical

29:21.280 --> 29:23.440
and ethical questions I want to ask you.

29:23.440 --> 29:27.600
Within this, it's back to your words

29:27.600 --> 29:29.560
and Anthony Fauci's words.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.800
When you're dealing with so much uncertainty

29:33.800 --> 29:36.120
and so much potential uncertainty

29:36.120 --> 29:39.200
about how catastrophic this virus is in the early days

29:40.560 --> 29:44.960
and knowing that each word you say may create panic,

29:46.200 --> 29:48.520
how do you communicate science with the world?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.560
It's a philosophical, it's an ethical,

29:53.560 --> 29:55.680
it's a practical question.

29:55.680 --> 29:59.360
There was a discussion about masks a century ago

29:59.360 --> 30:01.320
and that too led to panic.

30:03.480 --> 30:07.440
So, I mean, I'm trying to put myself in the mind,

30:07.440 --> 30:09.600
in your mind and the mind of Anthony Fauci

30:09.600 --> 30:10.440
in those early days,

30:10.440 --> 30:13.200
knowing that there's limited supply of masks.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.040
Like, what do you say?

30:15.040 --> 30:18.920
Do you fully convey the uncertainty of the situation,

30:18.920 --> 30:22.880
of the challenges of the supply chain

30:22.880 --> 30:25.000
or do you say that masks don't work?

30:26.680 --> 30:29.680
That's a complicated calculation.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.320
How do you make that calculation?

30:32.520 --> 30:35.440
It is a complicated calculation.

30:35.440 --> 30:39.120
As a scientist, your temptation would be

30:39.120 --> 30:43.400
to give a full brain dump of all the details

30:43.400 --> 30:45.240
of the information about what's known

30:45.240 --> 30:46.080
and what isn't known

30:46.080 --> 30:48.680
and what experiments need to be done.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.000
Most of the time, that's not gonna play well

30:51.000 --> 30:53.280
in a sound bite on the evening news.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.040
So you have to kind of distill it down to a recommendation

30:56.040 --> 30:58.600
that is the best you can do at that time

30:58.600 --> 31:00.240
with the information you've got.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.880
So you're a man of God and we'll return to that

31:04.880 --> 31:09.840
to talk about some also unanswerable philosophical questions.

31:09.840 --> 31:13.160
But first, let's linger on the vaccine

31:13.160 --> 31:16.640
because in the religious, in the Christian community,

31:16.640 --> 31:18.960
there was some hesitancy with the vaccine.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.880
Still is.

31:19.880 --> 31:20.720
Still is.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.200
There's a lot of data showing high efficacy

31:24.200 --> 31:27.800
and safety of vaccines, of COVID vaccines,

31:27.800 --> 31:31.880
but still they are far from perfect as all vaccines are.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.920
Can you empathize with people who are hesitant

31:33.920 --> 31:35.400
to take the COVID vaccine

31:35.400 --> 31:39.000
or to have their children take the COVID vaccine?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.560
I can totally empathize,

31:41.560 --> 31:43.320
especially when people are barraged

31:43.320 --> 31:45.400
by conflicting information coming at them

31:45.400 --> 31:47.120
from all kinds of directions.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.640
I've spent a lot of my time in the last year

31:50.640 --> 31:54.080
trying to figure out how to do a better job of listening

31:55.360 --> 31:59.800
because I think we have all got the risk of assuming

31:59.800 --> 32:03.280
we know the basis for somebody's hesitancy

32:03.280 --> 32:07.640
and that often doesn't turn out to be what you thought.

32:07.640 --> 32:11.720
And the variety of reasons is quite broad.

32:12.640 --> 32:16.880
I think a big concern is just this sense of uncertainty

32:16.880 --> 32:19.280
about whether this was done too fast

32:19.280 --> 32:20.680
and that corners were cut

32:20.680 --> 32:23.320
and there are good answers to that.

32:24.560 --> 32:28.240
Along with that, a sense that maybe this vaccine

32:28.240 --> 32:30.680
will have long-term effects that we won't know about

32:30.680 --> 32:32.400
for years to come.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.880
And one can say that hasn't been seen with other vaccines

32:35.880 --> 32:37.520
and there's no particular reason to think

32:38.360 --> 32:40.120
this one's gonna be different than the dozens of others

32:40.120 --> 32:41.120
that we have experience with,

32:41.120 --> 32:43.200
but you can't absolutely say,

32:43.200 --> 32:44.760
no, there's no chance of that.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.280
So it does come down to listening

32:49.280 --> 32:54.280
and then trying in a fashion that doesn't convey a message

32:55.120 --> 32:58.240
that you're smarter than the person you're talking to

32:58.240 --> 32:59.760
because that isn't gonna help

33:00.920 --> 33:03.920
to really address what the substance is that it concerns.

33:04.840 --> 33:07.520
But my heart goes out to so many people

33:07.520 --> 33:09.440
who are fearful about this

33:09.440 --> 33:13.520
because of all the information that has been dumped on them,

33:14.720 --> 33:18.280
some of it by politicians, a lot of it by the internet,

33:18.280 --> 33:20.680
some of it by parts of the media

33:20.680 --> 33:25.680
that seem to take pleasure in stirring up this kind of fear

33:27.320 --> 33:31.160
for their own reasons and that is shameful.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.160
I'm really sympathetic with the people

33:34.160 --> 33:36.680
who are confused and fearful.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.400
I am not sympathetic with people

33:38.400 --> 33:41.720
who are distributing information that's demonstrably false

33:41.720 --> 33:43.480
and continue to do so.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.440
They're taking lives.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.600
I didn't realize how strong that sector

33:49.600 --> 33:53.320
of disinformation would be

33:53.320 --> 33:56.760
and it's been in many ways more effective

33:56.760 --> 33:58.680
than the means of spreading the truth.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.200
This is gonna take us into another place

34:02.200 --> 34:06.040
but, Lex, if there's something I'm really worried about

34:06.040 --> 34:08.520
in this country and it's not just this country

34:08.520 --> 34:10.080
but it's the one I live in,

34:10.080 --> 34:14.480
is that we have another epidemic besides COVID-19

34:14.480 --> 34:18.520
and it's an epidemic of the loss of the anchor of truth,

34:20.040 --> 34:23.240
that truth as a means of making decisions,

34:23.240 --> 34:25.560
truth as a means of figuring out

34:26.440 --> 34:28.640
how to wrestle with a question like,

34:28.640 --> 34:32.040
should I get this vaccine for myself or my children,

34:32.040 --> 34:34.360
seems to have lost its primacy

34:35.440 --> 34:38.800
and instead it's an opinion of somebody

34:38.800 --> 34:42.560
who expressed it very strongly

34:42.560 --> 34:46.640
or some Facebook post that I read two hours ago

34:48.440 --> 34:52.680
and for those to become substitutes for objective truth,

34:53.680 --> 34:56.520
not just, of course, for vaccines

34:56.520 --> 34:58.640
but for many other issues like,

34:58.640 --> 35:01.280
was the 2020 election actually fair?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.920
This worries me deeply.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.560
It's bad enough to have polarization and divisions

35:09.640 --> 35:11.440
but to have no way of resolving those

35:11.440 --> 35:13.640
by actually saying, okay, what's true here,

35:14.600 --> 35:17.200
makes me very worried about the path we're on

35:17.200 --> 35:18.640
and I'm usually an optimist.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.600
Well, to give you an optimistic angle on this,

35:22.600 --> 35:26.640
I actually think that this sense

35:26.640 --> 35:29.480
that there's no one place for truth,

35:29.480 --> 35:33.240
it's just a thing that will inspire leaders

35:33.240 --> 35:35.480
and science communicators to speak

35:35.480 --> 35:38.880
not from a place of authority but from a place of humility.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.840
I think it's just challenging people

35:40.840 --> 35:44.800
to communicate in a new way, to be listeners first.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.440
I think the problem isn't that

35:47.680 --> 35:49.840
there's a lot of misinformation.

35:49.840 --> 35:54.520
I think that people,

35:55.880 --> 36:00.880
the internet and the world are distrustful of people

36:01.720 --> 36:04.920
who speak as if they possess the truth

36:04.920 --> 36:08.160
with an authoritarian kind of tone

36:08.160 --> 36:10.160
which was, I think, defining

36:10.160 --> 36:12.560
for what science was in the 20th century.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.720
I just think it has to sound different in the 21st

36:16.680 --> 36:18.880
with, in the battle of ideas,

36:18.880 --> 36:21.240
I think humility and love wins

36:22.240 --> 36:24.720
and that's how science wins,

36:24.720 --> 36:27.200
not through having quote unquote truth

36:27.200 --> 36:30.800
because now everybody can just say, I have the truth.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.200
I think you have to speak, like I said,

36:34.200 --> 36:35.520
from humility, not authority.

36:35.520 --> 36:39.120
And so it just challenges our leaders to go back

36:39.120 --> 36:43.280
and learn to be, pardon my French, less assholes

36:43.280 --> 36:48.200
and more kind and, like you said, to listen,

36:48.200 --> 36:50.400
to listen to the experiences of people

36:50.400 --> 36:52.640
that are good people, not the ones who are trying

36:52.640 --> 36:55.200
to manipulate the system or play a game and so on

36:55.200 --> 36:59.360
but real people who are just afraid of uncertainty

36:59.360 --> 37:02.560
of hurting those they loved and so on.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.360
So I think it's just an opportunity for leaders

37:04.360 --> 37:07.440
to go back and take a class on effective communication.

37:07.440 --> 37:12.440
I'm with you on shifting more from where we are

37:13.040 --> 37:14.200
to humility and love.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.480
That's gotta be the right answer.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.080
That's very biblical, by the way.

37:18.440 --> 37:19.280
We'll get there.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.480
I have to bring up Joe Rogan.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.120
I don't know if you know who he is.

37:24.120 --> 37:24.960
I do.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.800
He's a podcaster, comedian, fighting commentator

37:27.800 --> 37:30.360
and my now friend.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.720
And Iver Macdon, a believer too.

37:32.720 --> 37:35.720
Yes, that is the question I have to ask you about.

37:36.720 --> 37:39.000
He has gotten some flack in the mainstream media

37:39.000 --> 37:40.840
for not getting vaccinated.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.800
And when he got COVID recently,

37:42.800 --> 37:46.920
taking Iver Macdon as part of a cocktail of treatments.

37:46.920 --> 37:50.520
The NIH actually has a nice page on Iver Macdon saying,

37:50.520 --> 37:53.720
quote, there's insufficient evidence to recommend

37:53.720 --> 37:57.160
either for or against the use of Iver Macdon

37:57.160 --> 37:59.320
for the treatment of COVID-19.

37:59.320 --> 38:02.560
Results from adequately powered, well-designed

38:02.560 --> 38:04.800
and well-conducted clinical trials are needed

38:04.800 --> 38:07.720
to provide more specific evidence-based guidance

38:07.720 --> 38:11.320
on the role of Iver Macdon in the treatment of COVID-19.

38:12.400 --> 38:15.560
So let me ask, why do you think there has been so much attack

38:15.560 --> 38:18.440
on Joe Rogan and anyone else

38:18.440 --> 38:20.280
that's talking about Iver Macdon

38:20.280 --> 38:23.480
when there's insufficient evidence for or against?

38:24.840 --> 38:26.680
Well, let's unpack that.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.760
First of all, I think the concerns about Joe

38:28.760 --> 38:32.120
are not limited to his taking Iver Macdon.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.760
Much more seriously, his being fairly publicly negative

38:35.760 --> 38:40.000
about vaccines at a time where people are dying.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.240
700,000 people have died from COVID-19.

38:43.240 --> 38:47.240
Estimates by Kaiser or at least 100,000 of those

38:47.240 --> 38:50.480
were unnecessary deaths of unvaccinated people.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.840
And for Joe to promote that further,

38:52.840 --> 38:57.840
even as this pandemic rages through our population,

38:58.240 --> 39:00.760
is simply irresponsible.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.120
So yeah, the Iver Macdon is just one other twist.

39:03.120 --> 39:06.000
Obviously, Iver Macdon has been controversial

39:06.000 --> 39:07.440
for months and months.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.520
The reason that it got particular attention

39:10.520 --> 39:12.480
is because of the way in which it seemed

39:12.480 --> 39:16.360
to have captured the imagination of a lot of people

39:16.360 --> 39:18.580
and to the point where they were taking doses

39:18.580 --> 39:21.040
that were intended for livestock.

39:21.040 --> 39:23.080
And some of them got pretty sick as a result

39:23.080 --> 39:25.240
from overdosing on this stuff.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.760
That was not good judgment.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.680
The drug itself remains uncertain.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.440
There's a recent review that looks at all of the studies

39:35.440 --> 39:38.360
of Iver Macdon and basically concludes

39:38.360 --> 39:40.680
that it probably doesn't work.

39:40.680 --> 39:42.240
We are running a study right now.

39:42.240 --> 39:44.120
I looked at that data this morning

39:45.040 --> 39:47.240
in a trial called Active6,

39:47.240 --> 39:50.340
which is one of the ones that my public-private partnership

39:50.340 --> 39:51.180
is running.

39:51.180 --> 39:54.000
We're up to about 400 patients who've been randomized

39:54.000 --> 39:55.920
for Iver Macdon or placebo,

39:55.920 --> 39:59.520
and should know perhaps as soon as a month from now

39:59.520 --> 40:01.960
in a very carefully controlled trial,

40:01.960 --> 40:03.720
did it help or did it not?

40:03.720 --> 40:06.240
So there will be an answer.

40:06.240 --> 40:10.040
Coming back to Joe, again, I don't think the fact

40:10.040 --> 40:12.920
that he took the Iver Macdon and hoping it might work

40:12.920 --> 40:14.760
is that big a knock against him.

40:14.760 --> 40:19.340
It's more the conveying of we don't trust what science says,

40:19.340 --> 40:21.140
which is vaccines are gonna save your life.

40:21.140 --> 40:22.940
We're gonna trust what's on the internet

40:22.940 --> 40:25.180
that says Iver Macdon and hydroxychloroquine

40:25.180 --> 40:26.020
really do work,

40:26.020 --> 40:28.420
even though the scientific community says probably not.

40:28.420 --> 40:31.220
So let me push back on that a little bit.

40:31.220 --> 40:35.340
So he doesn't say let's not listen to science.

40:35.340 --> 40:38.520
He doesn't say don't get vaccinated.

40:39.660 --> 40:44.100
He says it's okay to ask questions.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.060
I'm okay with that.

40:45.060 --> 40:48.920
How risky is the vaccine for certain populations?

40:48.920 --> 40:51.900
What are the benefits and risks?

40:51.900 --> 40:55.920
There's other friends of Joe and friends of mine,

40:55.920 --> 40:59.860
like Sam Harris, who says if you look at the data,

40:59.860 --> 41:03.220
it's obvious that the benefits outweigh the risks.

41:03.220 --> 41:05.740
And what Joe says is yes,

41:05.740 --> 41:09.540
but let's still openly talk about risks.

41:09.540 --> 41:12.080
And he often brings up anecdotal evidence

41:12.080 --> 41:17.080
of people who've had highly negative effects from vaccines.

41:17.900 --> 41:20.360
Science is not done with anecdotal evidence.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.520
And so you could infer a lot of stuff

41:23.520 --> 41:24.900
from the way he expresses it,

41:24.900 --> 41:27.640
but he also communicates a lot of interesting questions.

41:29.040 --> 41:31.760
And that's something maybe you can comment on is,

41:32.920 --> 41:34.960
there's certain groups that are healthy.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.960
They're younger, they exercise a lot,

41:39.960 --> 41:43.560
they get nutrition and all those kinds of things.

41:43.560 --> 41:48.560
He shows skepticism on whether it's so obvious

41:48.640 --> 41:50.040
that they should get vaccinated.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.000
And the same is he makes this,

41:53.000 --> 41:57.320
he kind of presents the same kind of skepticism for kids,

41:57.320 --> 41:58.400
for young kids.

41:58.400 --> 42:03.400
So with empathy and listening my Russian

42:07.040 --> 42:09.280
in eloquent description of what Joe believes,

42:09.280 --> 42:12.240
what is your kind of response to that?

42:12.240 --> 42:15.560
Why should certain categories of healthy

42:15.560 --> 42:18.200
and young people still get vaccinated, do you think?

42:18.200 --> 42:20.440
Well, first, just to say, it's great for Joe

42:20.440 --> 42:22.180
to be a skeptic, to ask questions.

42:22.180 --> 42:23.800
We should all be doing that.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.600
But then the next step is to go and see what the data says

42:26.600 --> 42:29.600
and see if there are actually answers to those questions.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.240
So coming to healthy people,

42:32.240 --> 42:35.240
I've done a bunch of podcasts besides this one.

42:35.240 --> 42:39.160
The one I think I remember most was a podcast

42:39.160 --> 42:42.960
with a worldwide wrestling superstar.

42:42.960 --> 42:43.800
Very nice.

42:43.800 --> 42:48.160
He's about six foot six and just absolutely solid muscle.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.400
And he got COVID and he almost died.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.600
And recovering from that, he said,

42:54.600 --> 42:58.480
I've got to let my supporters know

42:58.480 --> 43:01.000
because you can imagine worldwide wrestling fans

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
are probably not big embracers of the need for vaccines.

43:06.960 --> 43:11.960
And he just turned himself into a spokesperson

43:11.960 --> 43:15.000
for the fact that this virus doesn't care

43:15.000 --> 43:17.880
how healthy you are, how much you exercise,

43:17.880 --> 43:19.360
what a great specimen you are.

43:19.360 --> 43:21.880
It wiped him out.

43:21.880 --> 43:23.000
And we see that.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.880
The average person in the ICU right now with COVID-19

43:27.880 --> 43:30.100
is under age 50.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.720
I think there's a lot of people still thinking,

43:31.720 --> 43:33.740
oh, it's just those old people in the nursing homes.

43:33.740 --> 43:35.000
It's not going to be about me.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.360
They're wrong.

43:36.360 --> 43:38.360
And there are plenty of instances of people

43:38.360 --> 43:41.540
who were totally healthy with no underlying diseases,

43:41.540 --> 43:43.680
taking good care of themselves, not obese,

43:43.680 --> 43:47.020
exercising, who have died from this disease.

43:48.360 --> 43:52.680
700 children have died from this disease.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.920
Yes, some of them had underlying factors like obesity,

43:55.920 --> 43:58.020
but a lot of them did not.

43:58.020 --> 44:02.560
So it's fair to say younger people are less susceptible

44:02.560 --> 44:07.560
to serious illness, kids even less so than young adults,

44:07.720 --> 44:09.600
but it ain't zero.

44:09.600 --> 44:14.080
And if the vaccine is really safe and really effective,

44:14.080 --> 44:17.600
then you probably want everybody to take advantage of that,

44:18.200 --> 44:20.840
even though some are dropping their risks more than others,

44:20.840 --> 44:22.980
everybody's dropping their risks some.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.040
Are you worried about variants?

44:26.040 --> 44:28.160
So looking out into the future,

44:28.160 --> 44:32.480
what's your vision for all the possible trajectories

44:32.480 --> 44:34.960
that this virus takes in human society?

44:34.960 --> 44:37.960
I'm totally worried about the variants.

44:37.960 --> 44:42.100
Delta was such an impressive arrival on the scene

44:42.100 --> 44:43.360
in all the wrong ways.

44:43.360 --> 44:47.000
I mean, it took over the world.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.160
In the space of just a couple months

44:49.160 --> 44:52.800
because of its extremely contagious ability.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.080
Viruses would be beautiful if they weren't terrifying.

44:55.080 --> 44:56.200
Yeah, exactly.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.520
I mean, this whole story of viral evolution,

44:58.520 --> 45:01.600
scientifically is just amazingly elegant.

45:01.600 --> 45:03.360
Anybody who really wanted to understand

45:03.360 --> 45:08.000
how evolution works in real time, study SARS-CoV-2,

45:08.000 --> 45:09.800
because it's not just Delta, it's Alpha,

45:09.800 --> 45:12.560
it's Beta, and it's Gamma, and it's the fact

45:12.560 --> 45:16.560
that these sweep through the world's population

45:16.560 --> 45:20.740
by fairly minor differences in fitness.

45:21.680 --> 45:23.600
So the real question many people are wrestling is,

45:23.600 --> 45:25.000
is Delta it?

45:25.000 --> 45:27.080
Is it such a fit virus

45:27.080 --> 45:30.320
that nothing else will be able to displace it?

45:30.320 --> 45:31.360
I don't know.

45:31.360 --> 45:34.800
I mean, there's now Delta AY4,

45:34.800 --> 45:38.840
which is a variant of Delta that at least in the UK

45:38.840 --> 45:42.280
seems to be taking over the Delta population

45:42.280 --> 45:45.320
as though it's maybe even a little more contagious.

45:45.360 --> 45:47.120
That might be the first hint

45:47.120 --> 45:49.240
that we're seeing something new here.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.720
It's not a completely different virus.

45:51.720 --> 45:54.040
It's still Delta, but it's Delta plus.

45:55.680 --> 45:59.760
The big worry, Lex, is what's out there

45:59.760 --> 46:02.040
that is so different

46:02.040 --> 46:04.560
that the vaccine protection doesn't work?

46:05.920 --> 46:10.080
And we don't know how different it needs to be

46:10.080 --> 46:11.600
for the vaccine to start working.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.920
That's the terrifying thing about each of these variants.

46:15.880 --> 46:18.120
It's like, it's always a pleasant surprise

46:18.120 --> 46:21.080
that the vaccine seems to still have efficacy.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.960
And hooray for our immune system, may I say,

46:23.960 --> 46:26.240
because the vaccine immunized you

46:26.240 --> 46:29.000
against that original Wuhan virus.

46:31.120 --> 46:35.280
Now we can see that especially after two doses,

46:35.280 --> 46:37.580
and even more so after a booster,

46:37.580 --> 46:39.720
your immune system is so clever

46:39.720 --> 46:43.480
that it's also making a diversity of antibodies

46:43.480 --> 46:46.680
to cover some other things that might happen to that virus

46:46.680 --> 46:48.440
to make it a little different.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.920
And you're still getting really good coverage.

46:51.920 --> 46:56.560
Even for beta, which was South Africa B1351,

46:56.560 --> 46:59.960
which is the most different, it looks pretty good.

46:59.960 --> 47:02.840
But that doesn't mean it will always be as good as that

47:02.840 --> 47:06.200
if something gets really far away from the original virus.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.600
Now the good news is we would know what to do

47:08.600 --> 47:10.180
in that situation.

47:10.180 --> 47:15.180
The mRNA vaccines allow you to redesign the vaccine like that

47:15.860 --> 47:19.220
and to quickly get it through a few thousand participants

47:19.220 --> 47:21.500
in a clinical trial to be sure it's raising antibodies,

47:21.500 --> 47:23.620
and then bang, you could go.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.260
But I don't want to have to do that.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.620
There will be people's lives at risk in the meantime.

47:28.620 --> 47:30.420
And what's the best way to keep that from happening?

47:30.420 --> 47:33.740
Well, try to cut down the number of infections

47:33.740 --> 47:35.020
because you don't get variants

47:35.020 --> 47:37.340
unless the virus is replicating in a person.

47:37.340 --> 47:40.820
So how do we solve this thing?

47:40.820 --> 47:43.100
How do we get out of this pandemic?

47:43.100 --> 47:46.340
What's, like if you had like a wand or something

47:46.340 --> 47:50.540
or you could really implement policies,

47:50.540 --> 47:53.100
what's the full cocktail of solutions here?

47:53.100 --> 47:56.060
It's a full cocktail, it's not just one thing.

47:56.060 --> 47:58.060
In our own country here in the US,

47:58.060 --> 48:01.340
it would be getting those 64 million reluctant people

48:01.340 --> 48:03.060
to actually go ahead and get vaccinated.

48:03.060 --> 48:05.300
There's 64 million people who didn't get vaccinated?

48:05.300 --> 48:07.980
Adults, yes, not even counting the kids.

48:07.980 --> 48:10.540
64 million, isn't that astounding?

48:11.700 --> 48:13.420
Get the kids vaccinated.

48:13.420 --> 48:17.060
Hopefully their parents will see that as a good thing too.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.700
Get those of us who are due for boosters boosted

48:19.700 --> 48:21.420
because that's going to reduce our likelihood

48:21.420 --> 48:24.620
of having breakthrough infections and keep spreading it.

48:24.620 --> 48:27.540
Convince people that until we're really done with this,

48:27.540 --> 48:28.860
and we're not now,

48:28.860 --> 48:31.700
that social distancing and mask wearing indoors

48:31.700 --> 48:36.180
are still critical to cut down the number of new infections.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.940
But of course, that's our country.

48:38.940 --> 48:41.100
This is a worldwide pandemic.

48:41.100 --> 48:43.980
I worry greatly about the fact

48:43.980 --> 48:45.540
that low and middle income countries

48:45.540 --> 48:47.980
have for the most part not even gotten started

48:47.980 --> 48:49.580
with access to vaccines.

48:49.580 --> 48:51.980
And we have to figure out a way to speed that up

48:53.100 --> 48:56.180
because otherwise that's where the next variant

48:56.180 --> 48:58.220
will probably arrive.

48:58.220 --> 48:59.780
And who knows how bad it will be

48:59.780 --> 49:01.540
and it will cross the world quickly

49:01.540 --> 49:05.980
as we've seen happen repeatedly in the last 22 months.

49:05.980 --> 49:09.820
I think I'm really surprised, annoyed, frustrated

49:09.820 --> 49:14.660
that rapid at-home testing from the very beginning

49:14.660 --> 49:17.220
wasn't a big, big part of the solution.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.820
It seems, first of all, nobody's against it.

49:19.820 --> 49:22.220
That's one huge plus for testing,

49:22.220 --> 49:24.260
that everybody supports.

49:24.260 --> 49:27.260
Second of all, that's what America's good at

49:27.260 --> 49:29.900
is like mass manufacture of stuff,

49:29.900 --> 49:32.380
like stepping up, engineer stepping up

49:32.380 --> 49:34.020
and really deploying it.

49:34.020 --> 49:35.860
Plus, without the collection of data

49:35.860 --> 49:38.060
is giving people freedom,

49:38.060 --> 49:40.500
is giving them information and then freedom

49:40.500 --> 49:42.660
to decide what to do with that information.

49:42.660 --> 49:44.100
It's such a powerful solution.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.300
I don't understand.

49:45.300 --> 49:48.140
Well, now I think the Biden administration is,

49:48.140 --> 49:52.180
I think, emphasized the scaling of testing manufacturers.

49:52.180 --> 49:54.020
But I just feel like it's an obvious solution.

49:54.020 --> 49:57.460
Get a test that costs less than a dollar to manufacture,

49:57.460 --> 49:59.380
costs less than a dollar to buy

49:59.380 --> 50:02.460
and just everybody gets tested every single day.

50:02.460 --> 50:03.900
Don't share that data with anyone.

50:03.900 --> 50:05.180
You just make the decisions

50:05.180 --> 50:07.700
and I believe in the intelligence of people

50:07.700 --> 50:09.540
to make the right decision to stay at home

50:09.540 --> 50:11.180
when the test is positive.

50:11.180 --> 50:13.500
I am so completely with you on that

50:13.500 --> 50:15.380
and NIH has been smack in the middle

50:15.380 --> 50:17.820
of trying to make that dream come true.

50:17.820 --> 50:20.340
We're running a trial right now

50:20.340 --> 50:23.900
in Georgia, Indiana, Hawaii.

50:25.020 --> 50:26.500
And where's the other one?

50:27.420 --> 50:28.940
Oh, Kentucky.

50:28.940 --> 50:33.020
Basically blanketing a community with free testing.

50:33.020 --> 50:33.860
That's beautiful.

50:33.860 --> 50:36.860
And look to see what happens as far as stemming

50:36.860 --> 50:40.140
the spread of the epidemic and measuring it by wastewater

50:40.140 --> 50:42.580
because you can really tell whether you've cut back

50:42.580 --> 50:44.980
the amount of infection in the community.

50:44.980 --> 50:47.140
Yeah, I'm so with you.

50:47.140 --> 50:49.620
We got off to such a bad start with testing.

50:50.700 --> 50:52.460
And of course, all the testing was being done

50:52.460 --> 50:55.980
for the first several months in big box laboratories

50:55.980 --> 50:57.860
where you had to send the sample off

50:57.860 --> 50:59.340
and put it through the mail somehow

50:59.340 --> 51:01.500
and get the result back sometimes five days later

51:01.500 --> 51:03.940
after you've already infected a dozen people.

51:03.940 --> 51:06.820
It was just a completely wrong model, but it's what we had.

51:06.820 --> 51:09.860
And everybody was like, oh, we gotta stick with PCR

51:09.860 --> 51:12.060
because if you start using those home tests

51:12.060 --> 51:14.860
that are based on antigens lateral flow,

51:14.860 --> 51:16.620
probably there's gonna be false positives

51:16.620 --> 51:17.460
and false negatives.

51:17.460 --> 51:18.940
Okay, sure.

51:18.940 --> 51:23.460
No test is perfect, but having a test that's not acceptable

51:23.460 --> 51:26.140
or accessible is the worst setting.

51:26.140 --> 51:29.620
So we, NIH, with some requests from Congress

51:29.620 --> 51:32.660
got a billion dollars to create this program

51:32.660 --> 51:36.780
called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics, RADx.

51:36.780 --> 51:39.180
And we turned into a venture capital organization

51:39.180 --> 51:41.660
and we invited every small business or academic lab

51:41.660 --> 51:44.380
that had a cool idea about how to do home testing

51:44.380 --> 51:45.780
to bring it forward.

51:45.780 --> 51:48.340
And we threw them into what we called our shark tank

51:48.340 --> 51:51.100
of business experts, engineers, technology people.

51:51.100 --> 51:55.060
People understood how to deal with supply chains

51:55.060 --> 51:56.820
and manufacturing.

51:56.820 --> 52:00.300
And right now today, there are about 2 million tests

52:00.300 --> 52:03.580
being done based on what came out of that program,

52:03.580 --> 52:05.660
including most of the home tests

52:05.660 --> 52:07.660
that you can now buy on the pharmacy shelves.

52:07.660 --> 52:10.380
We did that and I wish we had done it faster,

52:10.380 --> 52:13.700
but it was an amazingly speedy effort.

52:13.700 --> 52:15.460
And you're right, companies are really good.

52:15.460 --> 52:18.140
Once they've gotten FDA emergency use authorization,

52:18.140 --> 52:20.300
and we helped a lot of them get that,

52:20.300 --> 52:22.900
they can scale up their manufacturing.

52:22.900 --> 52:27.900
I think in December, we should have about 410 million tests

52:28.580 --> 52:30.260
for that month ready to go.

52:30.260 --> 52:34.020
And if we can get one or two more platforms approved,

52:34.020 --> 52:36.700
and by the way, we are now helping FDA

52:36.700 --> 52:39.140
by being their validation lab.

52:39.140 --> 52:41.020
If we can get a couple more of these approved,

52:41.020 --> 52:44.740
we could be in the half a billion tests a month,

52:44.740 --> 52:46.860
which is really getting where we need to be.

52:46.860 --> 52:47.860
Wow.

52:47.860 --> 52:48.900
Yeah, that's a dream.

52:48.900 --> 52:49.740
That's a dream for me.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.700
It seems like an obvious solution.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.900
Engineering solution, everybody's behind it.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.980
It leads to hope versus division.

52:55.980 --> 52:57.220
I love it.

52:57.220 --> 52:58.060
Okay.

52:59.620 --> 53:00.660
A happy story.

53:00.660 --> 53:01.500
A happy story.

53:01.500 --> 53:02.740
I was waiting for one.

53:02.740 --> 53:03.580
Yeah, all right.

53:03.580 --> 53:06.380
Well, one last dive into the non-happy,

53:06.380 --> 53:08.900
but you won't even have to comment on it.

53:08.900 --> 53:11.340
Well, comment on the broader philosophical question.

53:11.340 --> 53:16.260
So NIH, again, I said Joe Rogan

53:16.260 --> 53:18.820
as the first one who pointed me to this.

53:18.820 --> 53:21.860
NIH was recently accused of funding research of a paper

53:21.860 --> 53:24.060
that had images of sedated puppies

53:24.060 --> 53:26.460
with their heads inserted into small enclosures

53:26.460 --> 53:28.780
containing disease carrying sand flies.

53:29.620 --> 53:34.620
So I can just say that this story is not true,

53:34.820 --> 53:37.220
or at least the,

53:37.220 --> 53:40.380
I think it is true that the paper that showed those images

53:40.380 --> 53:43.300
cited NIH as a funding source,

53:43.300 --> 53:45.140
but that citation is not correct.

53:45.140 --> 53:45.980
That was not correct.

53:45.980 --> 53:47.500
Yeah.

53:47.500 --> 53:51.580
But that brings up a bigger philosophical question

53:51.580 --> 53:54.620
that could have been correct.

53:54.620 --> 53:57.380
How difficult is it as a director of NIH

53:57.380 --> 53:58.860
or just NIH as an organization

53:58.860 --> 54:03.060
that's funding so many amazing deep research studies

54:03.060 --> 54:07.260
to ensure the ethical fortitude of those studies

54:07.260 --> 54:10.100
when the ethics of science is,

54:10.100 --> 54:12.220
there's such a gray area between what is

54:12.220 --> 54:13.460
and what isn't ethical?

54:14.700 --> 54:16.660
Well, tough issues.

54:16.660 --> 54:19.980
Certainly animal research is a tough issue.

54:19.980 --> 54:21.420
I was going to bring up,

54:21.420 --> 54:25.740
it's a good example of that tough issue is in 2015,

54:25.740 --> 54:27.940
you announced that NIH will no longer support

54:27.940 --> 54:31.860
any biomedical research involving chimpanzees.

54:31.860 --> 54:36.740
So that's like one example of looking in the mirror,

54:36.740 --> 54:39.700
thinking deeply about what is and isn't ethical

54:40.300 --> 54:42.500
and there was a conclusion that biomedical research

54:42.500 --> 54:45.060
on chimps is not ethical.

54:45.060 --> 54:46.420
That was the conclusion.

54:46.420 --> 54:48.260
That was based on a lot of deep thinking

54:48.260 --> 54:50.500
and a lot of input from people

54:50.500 --> 54:52.020
who have considered this issue

54:52.020 --> 54:54.980
and a panel of the National Academy of Sciences

54:54.980 --> 54:57.660
that was asked to review the issue.

54:57.660 --> 55:01.420
I mean, the question that I wanted them to look at was,

55:01.420 --> 55:05.460
are we actually learning anything that's really essential

55:05.460 --> 55:09.020
from chimpanzee invasive research at this point,

55:09.020 --> 55:13.940
or is it time to say that these closest relatives of ours

55:13.940 --> 55:16.140
should not be subjected to that any further

55:16.140 --> 55:19.140
and ought to be retired to a sanctuary?

55:19.140 --> 55:20.460
And that was the conclusion,

55:20.460 --> 55:24.700
that there was really no kind of medical experimentation

55:24.700 --> 55:27.860
that needed to be done on chimps in order to proceed.

55:27.860 --> 55:29.700
So why are we still doing this?

55:29.700 --> 55:32.780
Many of these were chimpanzees that were purchased

55:32.780 --> 55:37.780
because we thought they would be good hosts for HIV AIDS

55:38.020 --> 55:39.740
and they sort of weren't.

55:39.740 --> 55:43.300
And they were kept around in these primate laboratories

55:43.300 --> 55:45.860
with people coming up with other things to do,

55:45.860 --> 55:48.380
but they weren't compelling scientifically.

55:48.380 --> 55:50.420
So I think that was the right decision.

55:50.420 --> 55:53.540
I took a lot of flak from some of the scientific communities

55:53.540 --> 55:56.700
said, well, you're caving in to the animal rights people.

55:56.700 --> 55:59.340
And now that you've said no more research on chimps,

55:59.340 --> 56:00.380
what's next?

56:01.620 --> 56:04.980
Certainly when it comes to companion animals,

56:05.020 --> 56:09.100
everybody's heart starts to be hurting

56:09.100 --> 56:12.500
when you see anything done that seems harmful

56:12.500 --> 56:14.140
to a dog or a cat.

56:14.140 --> 56:16.420
I have a cat, I don't have a dog.

56:16.420 --> 56:18.180
And I understand that completely.

56:18.180 --> 56:21.500
That's why we have these oversight groups

56:21.500 --> 56:24.460
that decide before you do any of that kind of research,

56:24.460 --> 56:26.380
is it justified?

56:26.380 --> 56:29.780
And what kind of provision is gonna be made

56:29.780 --> 56:31.540
to avoid pain and suffering?

56:32.340 --> 56:35.420
And those have input from the public

56:35.420 --> 56:37.900
as well as the scientific community.

56:37.900 --> 56:40.460
Is that completely saying that every step

56:40.460 --> 56:45.460
that's happening there is ethical by some standard

56:47.100 --> 56:48.860
that would be hard for anybody to agree to?

56:48.860 --> 56:50.820
No, but at least it's a consensus

56:50.820 --> 56:53.060
of what people think is acceptable.

56:54.340 --> 56:58.180
Dogs are the only host for some diseases,

56:58.180 --> 57:01.580
like Leishmaniasis, which was that paper

57:01.580 --> 57:03.300
that we were not responsible for,

57:03.300 --> 57:05.540
but I know why they were doing the experiment,

57:05.540 --> 57:08.020
or like lymphatic filariasis,

57:08.020 --> 57:11.780
which is an experiment that we are supporting in Georgia

57:11.780 --> 57:14.860
that involves dogs getting infected with a parasite,

57:14.860 --> 57:16.780
because that's the only model we have to know

57:16.780 --> 57:18.940
whether a treatment is gonna work or not.

57:19.900 --> 57:21.980
So I will defend that.

57:21.980 --> 57:24.420
I am not in the place of those who think

57:24.420 --> 57:27.180
all animal research is evil,

57:27.220 --> 57:28.420
because I think if there's something

57:28.420 --> 57:30.780
that's gonna be done to save a child

57:30.780 --> 57:32.940
from a terrible disease or an adult,

57:32.940 --> 57:34.340
and it involves animal research

57:34.340 --> 57:36.260
that's been carefully reviewed,

57:36.260 --> 57:39.380
then I think ethically, while it doesn't make me comfortable,

57:39.380 --> 57:42.340
it still seems like it's the right choice.

57:42.340 --> 57:45.180
I think to say all animal research

57:45.180 --> 57:48.860
should be taken off the table is also very unethical,

57:48.860 --> 57:51.100
because that means you have basically doomed

57:51.100 --> 57:53.660
a lot of people for whom that research

57:53.660 --> 57:56.260
might have saved their lives to having no more hope.

57:57.940 --> 58:01.620
And to me personally, there's far greater concerns ethically

58:01.620 --> 58:03.980
in terms of factory farming, for example,

58:03.980 --> 58:06.260
the treatment of animals in other contexts.

58:06.260 --> 58:08.060
Oh, there's so much that goes on

58:08.060 --> 58:11.620
outside of medical research that is much more troubling.

58:12.420 --> 58:14.820
That said, I think all cats have to go.

58:14.820 --> 58:17.580
That's just my off-the-record opinion.

58:17.580 --> 58:19.940
That's why I'm not involved with any ethical decisions.

58:19.940 --> 58:22.260
I'm just joking, internet, I love cats.

58:22.260 --> 58:23.220
You're a dog person.

58:23.220 --> 58:25.020
I'm a dog person, I'm sorry.

58:25.020 --> 58:26.540
Have you seen that New Yorker cartoon

58:26.540 --> 58:30.020
where there are two dogs in the bar having a martini,

58:30.020 --> 58:31.460
and one is saying that they're dressed up

58:31.460 --> 58:34.100
in their business suits, and one says to the other,

58:34.100 --> 58:37.540
you know, it's not enough for the dogs to win.

58:37.540 --> 58:39.180
The cats have to lose.

58:40.820 --> 58:41.660
That's beautiful.

58:42.700 --> 58:46.500
So a few weeks ago, you've announced that you're resigning

58:46.500 --> 58:49.100
from the NIH at the end of the year.

58:49.100 --> 58:50.220
I'm stepping down.

58:50.220 --> 58:53.380
I'm still gonna be at NIH at a different capacity.

58:53.380 --> 58:54.820
Different capacity, right.

58:54.860 --> 58:58.940
And it's over a decade of an incredible career

58:58.940 --> 59:01.180
overseeing the NIH as its director.

59:02.220 --> 59:04.020
What are the things you're most proud of,

59:04.020 --> 59:06.980
of the NIH in your time here

59:06.980 --> 59:10.540
as its director may be memorable moments?

59:12.820 --> 59:14.260
There's a lot.

59:14.260 --> 59:18.140
In 12 years, science has just progressed

59:18.140 --> 59:21.380
in amazing ways over those 12 years.

59:22.580 --> 59:24.500
Think about where we are right now.

59:25.100 --> 59:26.580
Something like gene editing,

59:26.580 --> 59:29.420
being able to make changes in DNA

59:29.420 --> 59:31.060
even for therapeutic purposes,

59:31.060 --> 59:33.980
which is now curing sickle cell disease.

59:33.980 --> 59:38.100
Unthinkable when I became director in 2009.

59:38.100 --> 59:41.580
The ability to study single cells

59:41.580 --> 59:44.540
and ask them what they're doing and get an answer.

59:44.540 --> 59:47.140
Single cell biology just has emerged

59:47.140 --> 59:49.220
in this incredibly powerful way.

59:50.380 --> 59:53.980
Having the courage to be able to say,

59:53.980 --> 59:57.060
we could actually understand the human brain

59:57.060 --> 59:59.020
seemed like so far out there.

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.340
And we're in the process of doing that

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.940
with the brain initiative.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.260
Taking all that we've learned about the genome

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:08.980
and applying it to cancer,

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.300
to make individual cancer treatment really precision

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.060
and developing cancer immunotherapy,

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.340
which seemed like sort of a backwater

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.340
into some of the hottest science around.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:22.620
All those things sort of erupting

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:23.860
and much more to come, I'm sure.

01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:28.020
We're on an exponential curve of medical research advances

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.380
and that's glorious to watch.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.140
And of course, COVID-19 as a beneficiary

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.540
of decades of basic science,

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.740
understanding what mRNA is,

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.220
understanding basics about coronaviruses and spike proteins

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.420
and how to combine structural biology and immunology

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.460
and genomics into this package

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.380
that allows you to make a vaccine in 11 months.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:53.620
Just, I would never have imagined that possible in 2009.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.460
So to have been able to kind of be the midwife

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.020
helping all of those things get birthed,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.260
that's been just an amazing 12 years.

01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:06.660
And as NIH director, you have this convening power

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:09.140
and this ability to look across the whole landscape

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.700
of biomedical research and identify areas

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.780
that are just like ready for something big to happen,

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.580
but it isn't gonna happen spontaneously

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.900
without some encouragement,

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.740
without pulling people together from different disciplines

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:22.740
who don't know each other

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.940
and maybe don't know how to quite understand

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.660
each other's scientific language

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:29.060
and create an environment for that to happen.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:32.100
That has been just an amazing experience.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.380
I mean, I mentioned the Brain Initiative as one of those.

01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:36.540
The Brain Initiative right now,

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.860
I think there's about 600 investigators working on this.

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.420
Last week, the whole issue of Nature Magazine

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.980
was about the output of the Brain Initiative

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.660
basically now giving us a cell census

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.220
of what those cells in the brain are doing,

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:53.900
which has just never been imaginable.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:57.900
And interestingly, most, more than half

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.900
of the investigators in the Brain Initiative are engineers.

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:04.020
They're not biologists in a traditional sense.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.860
I love that.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:08.260
Maybe partly because my PhD is in quantum mechanics.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.700
So I think it's really a good idea

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.180
to bring disciplines together and see what happens.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.540
That's an exciting thing.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:19.700
And I will not ever forget having the chance

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.700
to announce that program in the East Room

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.860
in that White House with President Obama

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.620
who totally got it and totally loved science

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.380
and working with him in some of those rare moments

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.140
of sort of one-on-one conversation in the Oval Office,

01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.020
just him and me about science, that's a gift.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.540
What's it like talking to Barack Obama about science?

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.900
He seems to be a sponge.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:46.860
I've heard him, I'm an artificial intelligence person

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:48.660
and I've heard him talk about AI

01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.300
and it was like, it made me think,

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.340
is somebody like whispering in his ear or something?

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.300
Because he was saying stuff that totally passed the BS test.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.540
Like he really understands stuff.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540
He does.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:02.420
That means he listened to a bunch of experts on AI.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.940
He was like explaining the difference

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.860
between narrow artificial intelligence and strong AI.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.220
Like he was saying all this,

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.460
both technical and philosophical stuff.

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.260
And it just made me, I don't know,

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:16.020
it made me hopeful about the depth of understanding

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.540
that a human being in political office can attain.

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.900
That gave me hope as well, and having those experiences.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.620
Oftentimes in a group, I mean, another example

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.260
was trying to figure out how do we take

01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.820
what we've learned about the genome

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:32.060
and really apply it at scale

01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:34.020
to figure out how to prevent illness,

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.140
not just treat it, but prevent it,

01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:38.820
out of which came this program called All of Us,

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:43.460
this million strong American cohort of participants

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.380
who make their electronic health records

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.700
and their genome sequences and everything else available

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:48.660
to look at.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:51.860
That came out of a couple of conversations

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.100
with Obama and others in his office,

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.620
and he asked the best questions.

01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:00.580
That was what struck me so much.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.740
I mean, a room full of scientists,

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:05.220
and we'd be talking about the possible approaches,

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.580
and he would come up with this incredibly insightful,

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.460
penetrating question.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.380
Not that he knew what the answer was gonna be,

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.420
but he knew what the right question was.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:17.060
I think the core to that is curiosity.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.220
I don't think he's even like,

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:20.420
he's trying to be a good leader.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.340
He's legit curious.

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.820
Yes, legit.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:26.660
That he, almost like a kid in a candy store,

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.300
gets to talk to the world experts.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.980
He somehow sneaked into this office

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.260
and gets to talk to the world experts,

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.860
and that's the kind of energy that I think leads

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.140
to beautiful leadership in the space of science.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:41.300
Indeed.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.540
Another thing I've been able to do as director

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.700
is to try to break down some of the boundaries

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.260
that seem to be traditional

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:49.220
between the public and the private sectors.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:50.820
When it comes to areas of science

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.940
that really could and should be open access anyway,

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.260
why don't we work together?

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:58.340
And that was obvious early on,

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:03.340
and after identifying a few possible collaborators

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:07.460
who are chief scientists of pharmaceutical companies,

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.780
it looked as like we might be able

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:10.420
to do something in that space.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:12.220
Out of that was born something called

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.020
the Accelerating Medicines Partnership, AMP.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:19.340
And it took a couple of years of convening people

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.460
who usually didn't talk to each other,

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.020
and there was a lot of suspicion.

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:24.860
Academic scientists saying,

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.100
oh, those scientists in pharma, they're not that smart.

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.980
They're just trying to make money.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.140
And the academic scientists getting the rap

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.540
from the pharmaceutical scientists,

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.980
all they want to do is publish papers.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.180
They don't really care about helping anybody.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:41.060
And we found out both of those stereotypes were wrong,

01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.300
and over the course of that couple of years,

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.620
built a momentum behind three starting projects,

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:50.020
one on Alzheimer's, one on diabetes,

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.140
one on rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.460
Very different, each one of them, trying to identify

01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:58.540
what is an area that we both really need to see advance,

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.180
and we could do better together,

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.860
and it's gonna have to be open access,

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.980
otherwise NIH is not gonna play.

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:06.660
And guess what, industry, if you really wanna do this,

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.220
you gotta have skin in the game.

01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:10.740
We'll cover half the cost, you gotta cover the other half.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.340
I love it, enforcing open access,

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:16.260
so resulting in open science.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.940
Millions of dollars gone into this,

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.980
and it has been a wild success.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:22.460
After many people were skeptical,

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:24.580
a couple years later,

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.180
we had another project on Parkinson's.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.580
More recently, we added one on schizophrenia.

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:34.060
Just this week, we added one on gene therapy,

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:38.140
on bespoke gene therapy for ultra rare diseases,

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.460
which otherwise aren't gonna have enough

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.220
commercial appeal.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.380
But if we did this together,

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:45.620
especially with FDA at the table, and they have been,

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.940
we could make something happen,

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:49.860
turn this into a sort of standardized approach

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.540
where everything didn't have to be a one-off.

01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:54.380
I'm really excited about that.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.660
So what began as three projects is six,

01:06:56.660 --> 01:06:58.540
and it's about to be seven next year

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.700
with a heart failure project.

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.660
And all of us have gotten to know each other.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:05.580
And if it weren't for that background,

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.900
when COVID came along, it would have been a lot harder

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:11.100
to build the partnership called ACTIVE,

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.460
which has been my passion for the last 20 months,

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.180
accelerating COVID-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines.

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.100
We just had our leadership team meeting this morning.

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.180
It was amazing what's been accomplished.

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.900
That's pretty much 100 people who dropped everything

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:29.140
just to work on this, about half from industry

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:31.380
and half from government and academia.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:36.580
And that's how we got vaccine master protocols designed.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.660
So we all agreed about what the endpoints

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.460
had to be, and you wondered,

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.580
why are there 30,000 participants in each of these trials?

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.060
That's because of ACTIVE's group mapping out

01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:49.700
what the power needed to be for this to be convincing.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.140
Same with therapeutics.

01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.900
We have run at least 20 therapeutic agents through trials

01:07:57.900 --> 01:08:00.980
that ACTIVE supported in record time.

01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.780
That's how we got monoclonal antibodies that we know work.

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.820
That's been, that would not have been possible

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.420
if I didn't already have a sense of how to work

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.420
with the private sector that came out of AMP.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.060
AMP took two years to get started.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:18.460
ACTIVE took two weeks.

01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:20.620
We just kept the lawyers.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.900
Wow, to get 100 people over.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:25.220
Yeah, kept the lawyers out of the room, and away with it.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:29.140
Now you're gonna get yourself in trouble.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:34.700
So I do hope one day the story of this incredible vaccine,

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.460
development of vaccine protocols and trials

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.660
and all this kind of details,

01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:41.140
the messy, beautiful details of the science and engineering

01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.340
and that led to the manufacturing and the deployment

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.220
and the scientific tests.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.540
It's such a nice dance between engineering

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.700
in the space of manufacture of the vaccines.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.100
You start before the studies are complete,

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.060
you start making the vaccines just in case

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.020
if the studies prove to be positive,

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.740
then you can start deploying them.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:03.980
Just like so many parties, like you said,

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.700
private and public playing together.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.140
That's just a beautiful dance that is one of the,

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:11.940
is one of, for me, the sources of hope

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:15.940
in this very tricky time where there's a lot of things

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:21.940
to be cynical about in terms of the games politicians play

01:09:21.940 --> 01:09:23.980
and the hardship experience of the economy

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:25.340
and all those kinds of things.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.340
That to me this dance was a vaccine development

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.180
was done just beautifully and it gives me hope.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.420
It does me as well.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.380
And it was in many ways the finest hour

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:41.580
that science has had in a long time being called upon

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.060
when every day counted and making sure

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:49.140
that time was not wasted and things were done rigorously

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:49.980
but quickly.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:54.820
So you're incredibly good as a leader of the NIH.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:57.940
It seems like you're having a heck of a lot of fun.

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:02.740
Why step down from this role after so much fun?

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.740
Well, no other NIH director has served

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:09.340
more than one president after being appointed

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.740
by one, you're sort of done.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.980
And the idea of being carried over

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.740
for a second presidency with Trump

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.620
and now a third one with Biden is unheard of.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.660
I just think, Lex, that scientific organizations

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:26.380
benefit from new vision and 12 years is a really long time

01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.460
to have the same leader.

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:30.220
And if I wasn't gonna stick it out

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:33.180
for the entire Biden four-year term,

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.780
it's good not to wait too late during that

01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.660
to signal an intent to step down

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:40.860
because the president's gotta find the right person,

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:44.140
gotta nominate them, gotta get the Senate to confirm them

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:47.500
which is a unpredictable process right now.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.220
And you don't wanna try to do that

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:52.780
in the second half of somebody's term as president.

01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:53.900
This has gotta happen now.

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:56.380
So I kind of decided back at the end of May

01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:00.740
that this should be my final year and I'm okay with that.

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.860
I do have some mixed emotions

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.660
because I love the NIH, I love the job.

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.580
It's exhausting.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:13.300
I'm traditionally for the last 20 months anyway

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.620
working 100 hours a week.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.820
It's just, that's what it takes to juggle all of this.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.180
That keeps me from having a lot of time for anything else.

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.300
And I wouldn't mind,

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:25.780
cause I don't think I'm done yet.

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:28.260
I wouldn't mind having some time

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.340
to really think about what the next chapter should be.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:33.780
And I have none of that time right now.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.180
Do I have another calling?

01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:36.940
Is there something else I could contribute

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:38.340
that's different than this?

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:40.860
I'd like to find that out.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.980
I think the right answer is you're just stepping down

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:47.580
to focus on your music career.

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:52.820
That might not be a good plan for anything, very sustainable.

01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:56.100
But I think that is a sign of a great leader

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.820
as George Washington did stepping down at the right time.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:00.820
Ted Williams.

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:03.700
Yes.

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:05.940
I think he hit a home run on his last at bat

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:08.540
and his average was 400 at the time.

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:10.380
No one to walk away.

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.180
I mean, it's hard, but it's beautiful to see in a leader.

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.260
You also oversaw the Human Genome Project.

01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:19.300
You mentioned the Brain Initiative,

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.300
which it's a dream to map the human brain

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:29.020
and there's the dream to map the human code,

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.460
which was the Human Genome Project.

01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.900
And you have said that it is humbling for me

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.980
and awe-inspiring to realize

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.180
that we have caught the first glimpse

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.860
of our own instruction book,

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.900
previously known only to God.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.460
How does that, if you can just kind of wax poetic

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:49.260
for a second, how does it make you feel

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.740
that we were able to map this instruction book,

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:57.580
look into our own code and be able to reverse engineer it?

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.820
It's breathtaking.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.580
It's so fundamental.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.700
And yet for all of human history,

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.620
we're ignorant of the details

01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:11.260
of what that instruction book looked like.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.220
And then we crossed a bridge into the territory of the known

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.740
and we had that in front of us,

01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:21.660
still written in a language that we had to learn how to read

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:23.260
and we're in the process of doing that

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.700
and will be for decades to come, but we owned it, we had it.

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:30.860
And it has such profound consequences.

01:13:30.860 --> 01:13:33.780
It's both a book about our history,

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.580
it's a book of sort of the parts list of a human being,

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:43.060
the genes that are in there and how they're regulated.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.460
And it's also a medical textbook

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.780
that can teach us things that will provide answers

01:13:48.780 --> 01:13:50.980
to illnesses we don't understand

01:13:50.980 --> 01:13:53.540
and alleviate suffering and premature death.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:57.140
So it's a pretty amazing thing to contemplate

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:00.260
and it has utterly transformed the way we do science.

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:02.420
And it is in the process of transforming

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.540
the way we do medicine,

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.140
although much of that still lies ahead.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.260
While we were working on the genome project,

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:16.260
it was sort of hard to get this sense of a wow-ness

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.900
because it was just hard work

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:21.220
and you were getting another mega base.

01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.860
Okay, this is good.

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:26.900
But when did you actually step back and say, we did it?

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.740
It's the profoundness of that.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.820
I mean, there were two points, I guess.

01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.700
One was the announcement on that June 26, 2000,

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.300
where the whole world heard, well, we don't quite have it,

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.380
but we got a pretty good draft.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:41.660
And suddenly people are like realizing,

01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:44.100
oh, this is a big deal.

01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.380
For me, it was more when we got the full analysis of it,

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.980
published it in February 2001 in that issue of nature

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:54.460
paper that Eric Lander and Bob Waterston and I

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.660
were the main authors and we toiled over

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:00.820
and tried to get as much insight as we could in there

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.940
about what the meaning of all this was.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.500
But you also had this sense that

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.820
we are such beginning readers here.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.460
We are still in kindergarten trying to make sense

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.740
out of this 3 billion letter book.

01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:17.500
And we're gonna be at this for generations to come.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.380
You are a man of faith, Christian,

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:25.260
and you are a man of science.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:29.420
What is the role of religion and of science in society

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:34.220
and in the individual human mind and heart like yours?

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.380
Well, I was not a person of faith when I was growing up.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.180
I became a believer in my 20s,

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:45.820
influenced as a medical student by a recognition

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.980
that I hadn't really thought through the issues

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.140
of what's the meaning of life?

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:52.660
Why are we all here?

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:54.380
What happens when you die?

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.820
Is there a God?

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.340
Science is not so helpful in answering those questions.

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:01.700
So I had to look around in other places

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.060
and ultimately came to my own conclusion that atheism,

01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:08.660
which is where I had been,

01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:11.460
was the least supportable of the choices

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:14.820
because it was the assertion of a universal negative

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.700
which scientists aren't supposed to do.

01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:21.820
And agnosticism came as an attractive option

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.500
but felt a little bit like a cop-out

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.980
so I had to keep going trying to figure out

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:28.380
why do believers actually believe this stuff?

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.500
And came to realize it was all pretty compelling

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.500
that there's no proof.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.260
I can't prove to you or anybody else that God exists

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.420
but I can say it's pretty darn plausible.

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:43.140
And ultimately, what kind of God is it

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.620
caused me to search through various religions

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:48.460
and see, well, what do people think about that?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:53.020
And to my surprise, encountered the person of Jesus Christ

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.300
as unique in every possible way

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.020
and answering a lot of the questions

01:16:59.020 --> 01:17:00.860
I couldn't otherwise answer.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:06.740
And somewhat kicking and screaming, I became a Christian.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:10.420
Even though at the time, as a medical student

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:12.100
already interested in genetics,

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.700
people predicted my head would then explode

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:18.100
because these were incompatible worldviews.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.620
They really have not been for me.

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:23.940
I am so fortunate, I think, that in a given day,

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.180
wrestling with an issue,

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:31.020
it can have both the rigorous scientific component

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:33.100
and it can have the spiritual component.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.620
COVID-19 is a great example.

01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.660
These vaccines are both an amazing scientific achievement

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.860
and an answer to prayer.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:44.780
When I'm wrestling with vaccine hesitancy

01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.340
and trying to figure out what answers to come up with,

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.140
I get so frustrated sometimes

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:53.060
and I'm comforted by reassurances

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:55.340
that God is aware of that.

01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:56.900
I don't have to do this alone.

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.500
So I know there are people like your friend, Sam Harris,

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:04.740
who feel differently.

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:09.260
Sam wrote a rather famous op-ed in the New York Times

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.780
when I was nominated as the NIH director,

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:14.780
saying, this is a terrible mistake.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:19.780
You can't have somebody who believes in God running the NIH.

01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.180
God running the NIH,

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.780
he's just gonna completely ruin the place.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.940
Well, I have a testimonial.

01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:31.220
Christopher Hitchens, a devout atheist, if I could say so,

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.900
was a friend of yours and referred to you as, quote,

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.220
one of the greatest living Americans

01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:39.100
and stated that you were one of the most devout believers

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.660
he has ever met.

01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:43.220
He further stated that you were sequencing the genome

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:46.060
of the cancer that would ultimately claim his life

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.020
and that your friendship,

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.020
despite their differing opinions on religion,

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:55.020
was an example of the greatest armed truce in modern times.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:58.100
What did you learn from Christopher Hitchens about life

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.940
or perhaps what is a fond memory you have of this man

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.060
with whom you've disagreed but who is also your friend?

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.220
Yeah, I loved Hitch.

01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.820
I'm sorry he's gone.

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:12.540
Iron sharpens iron.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.260
There's nothing better for trying to figure out

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:18.140
where you are with your own situation

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.740
and your own opinions, your own worldviews

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.780
than encountering somebody who's completely

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:26.540
in another space and who's got the gift, as Hitch did,

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.340
of challenging everything and doing so

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.340
over a glass of scotch or two or three.

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:35.260
Yeah, we got off to a rough start

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.660
where in an interaction we had at a rather highbrow dinner,

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:45.220
he was really deeply insulting of a question I was asking,

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.140
but I was like, okay, that's fine.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:51.420
Let's figure out how we can have a more civil conversation.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:54.980
And then I really learned to greatly admire his intellect

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.700
and to find the jousting with him.

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:01.780
And it wasn't all about faith, although it often was.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:05.500
It was really inspiring and innovating, energizing.

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:09.860
And then when he got cancer, I became sort of his ally

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.960
trying to help him find pathways through the various options

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:17.880
and maybe helped him to stay around on this planet

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.760
for an extra six months or so.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.160
And I have the warmest feelings

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.160
of being in his apartment downtown over a glass of wine,

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.160
talking about whatever.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:33.120
Sometimes it was science.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.880
He was fascinated by science.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.840
Sometimes it was Thomas Jefferson.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.840
Sometimes it was faith.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.560
And I knew it would always be really interesting.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.680
So he's now gone.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:46.520
Yeah.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.960
Do you think about your own mortality?

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.680
Are you afraid of death?

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.560
I'm not afraid.

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.840
I'm not looking forward to it.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.080
I don't want to rush it

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.880
because I feel like I got some things I can still do here.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.540
But as a person of faith, I don't think I'm afraid.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:03.740
I'm 71.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.960
I know I don't have an infinite amount of time left

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.360
and I want to use the time I've got

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.240
in some sort of way that matters.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:15.080
I'm not ready to become a full-time golfer,

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.040
but I don't quite know what that is.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.360
I do feel that I've had a chance

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.880
to do amazingly powerful things as far as experiences.

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.640
And maybe God has something else in mind.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:34.520
I wrote this book 16 years ago,

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.240
The Language of God, about science and faith,

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.880
trying to explain how, from my perspective,

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.560
these are compatible.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:43.000
These are in harmony.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.280
They're complimentary if you are careful

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.540
about which kind of question you're asking.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:50.560
And to my surprise,

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.520
a lot of people seem to be interested in that.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:55.440
They were tired of hearing the extreme voices,

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.740
like Dawkins at one end,

01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:02.120
and people like Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:03.120
on the other end saying,

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.720
if you trust science, you're going to hell.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.620
And they thought there must be a way

01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:09.200
that these things could get along,

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.680
and that's what I tried to put forward.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:13.440
And then I started a foundation, BioLogos,

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.400
which then I had to step away from

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:18.040
to become NIH director, which has just flourished,

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.400
maybe because I stepped away, I don't know.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.960
But it now has millions of people who come to that website,

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.200
and they run amazing meetings.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.080
And I think a lot of people have really come to a sense

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.200
that this is okay.

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:32.200
I can love science, and I can love God,

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.540
and that's not a bad thing.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.320
So maybe there's something more I can do in that space.

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.240
Maybe that book is ready for a second edition.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:41.480
I think so.

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:45.800
But when you look back, life is finite.

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:47.440
What do you hope your legacy is?

01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:50.520
I don't know.

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:54.200
This whole legacy thing seems a little bit hard to embrace.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.240
It feels a little self-promoting, doesn't it?

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.840
I sort of feel like, in many ways,

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:01.240
I went to my own funeral on October 5th

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:02.880
when I announced that I was stepping down,

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.760
and I got the most amazing responses from people,

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:08.000
some of whom I knew really well,

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.120
some of whom I didn't know at all,

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.200
who were just telling me stories about something

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:16.920
that I had contributed to that made a difference to them.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.560
And that was incredibly heartwarming, and that's enough.

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:22.400
I don't want to build an edifice.

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.640
I don't have a plan for a monument or a statue.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:26.480
God help us.

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.240
I do feel like I've been incredibly fortunate.

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.760
I've had the chance to play a role

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.160
in things that were pretty profound,

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.480
from the Genome Project to NIH to COVID vaccines.

01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.600
And I ought to be plenty satisfied

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.600
that I've had enough experiences here

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:46.840
to feel pretty good about the way

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.400
in which my life panned out.

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.400
We did a bunch of difficult questions in this conversation.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.320
Let me ask the most difficult one,

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.040
that perhaps is the reason you turned to God.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.440
What is the meaning of life?

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.160
Have you figured it out yet?

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.320
You expect me to put that into three sentences?

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.400
We only have a couple of minutes, so please hurry up.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.080
Well, that's not a question that I think science helps me with,

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:20.360
so you're going to push me into the faith zone,

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.480
which is where I'd want to go with that.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.040
I think, well, what is the meaning?

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:25.880
Why are we here?

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.240
What do we put here to do?

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.640
I do believe we're here for just a blink of an eye

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.360
and that our existence somehow goes on beyond that

01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.800
in a way that I don't entirely understand

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.720
despite efforts to do so.

01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.960
I think we are called upon in this blink of an eye

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.800
to try to make the world a better place,

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.560
to try to love people,

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.560
to try to do a better job of our more altruistic instincts

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:59.480
and less of our selfish instincts,

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:03.120
to try to be what God calls us to be,

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.880
people who are holy,

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.880
not people who are driven by self-indulgence.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.160
And sometimes I'm better at that than others,

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.440
but I think that for me as a Christian is a pretty clear,

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:22.040
I mean, it's to live out the Sermon on the Mount.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.960
Once I read that, I couldn't unread it.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.320
All those beatitudes, all the blessings,

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.000
that's what we're supposed to do

01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.680
and the meaning of life is to strive for that standard,

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.520
recognizing you're going to fail over and over again

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.120
and that God forgives you.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.800
Hopefully to put a little bit of love

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.640
out there into the world.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.560
That's what it's about.

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.560
Francis, I'm truly humbled and inspired

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.520
by both your brilliance and your humility

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.160
and that you would spend your extremely valuable time

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.000
with me today.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.840
It was really an honor.

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:05.000
I was glad too and you asked a really good question.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.800
So your reputation as the best podcaster

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.960
has borne itself out here this afternoon.

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.760
Thank you so much.

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.280
Thanks for listening to this conversation

01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:15.480
with Francis Collins.

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.800

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:22.920
And now let me leave you with some words from Isaac Newton,

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.800
reflecting on his life and work.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.160
I seem to have been only like a boy,

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.160
playing on the seashore and diverting myself

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:33.840
and now and then finding a smoother pebble

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:36.360
or a prettier shell than ordinary,

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:38.760
whilst the great ocean of truth

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.880
lay all undiscovered before me.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:44.800
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
