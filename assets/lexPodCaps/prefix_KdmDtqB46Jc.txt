00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself. Why is it the rash guard? Yes

00:07.320 --> 00:11.120
And I talked so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this is gonna be rough

00:11.120 --> 00:16.240
You're learning this shut the fuck up. I got you man. You were powered by McDonald's and coca-cola

00:16.240 --> 00:19.160
I want more and then I smacked him and he didn't want to fight anymore

00:22.080 --> 00:28.240
If George St. Pierre and Khabib Nurmagomedov face each other in their prime who wins

00:31.000 --> 00:38.920
I'm here with three individuals each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective

00:39.360 --> 00:46.740
disciplines the greatest I'm a May fighter of all time George St. Pierre the greatest martial arts coach of all time

00:47.200 --> 00:49.200
John Donahue and

00:49.640 --> 00:51.920
the greatest submission grappler of all time

00:52.800 --> 00:54.720
Gordon Ryan

00:54.720 --> 00:56.720
So let me ask the first question

00:56.760 --> 00:59.080
You guys didn't see the question no preparation here

00:59.360 --> 01:04.000
What is the key to your success each of you one thing or multiple things that come to mind?

01:05.780 --> 01:07.780
John go first

01:12.320 --> 01:14.320
Is it the rash guard

01:15.080 --> 01:17.080
Yes, I

01:17.800 --> 01:21.640
Like that you choose John right off the bat seem the most nervous

01:21.760 --> 01:27.400
Inspire us to give the right answer for for me. It's about

01:29.720 --> 01:31.720
Finding a way to work in

01:32.120 --> 01:33.880
a world where

01:33.880 --> 01:36.400
Most of the answers are already known

01:37.000 --> 01:44.840
Okay, and in any developed sport by the time you enter that sport most of the basic precepts to the

01:45.360 --> 01:50.720
The major techniques that the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out

01:50.760 --> 01:52.760
and so

01:52.800 --> 01:54.800
in a highly developed world

01:56.760 --> 02:00.080
The key to success is to be able to identify

02:01.600 --> 02:06.700
Some area of the industry that you're in which is currently undervalued

02:07.680 --> 02:09.680
To do what the other people are not doing

02:10.520 --> 02:12.520
deeper than that you're

02:13.240 --> 02:18.720
Everyone has a view of okay. These are the the main skills of the industry I work in

02:19.640 --> 02:24.600
At any given time some set of skills attributes

02:26.480 --> 02:30.880
Will always be somewhat undervalued they're underappreciated by the people in the game

02:32.440 --> 02:38.440
You see that at any in any given industry there are always trends which change

02:40.080 --> 02:42.080
The nature of the industry over time so

02:43.240 --> 02:47.480
fashion trends in the clothing industry you'll see at any given time there's a

02:49.000 --> 02:54.680
General wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time

02:55.840 --> 03:03.800
What makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say here is something which is genuinely

03:04.280 --> 03:11.360
useful but which is currently being underused underutilized and I want to bring that back in and

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
develop it and

03:14.560 --> 03:17.400
Because it's an inherently useful product

03:17.960 --> 03:23.520
It will be very very successful in its initial applications against people who aren't currently using it

03:26.960 --> 03:31.960
If you can do this in whatever industry you're in I believe you'll be highly successful

03:32.800 --> 03:36.080
so this implies both for actual specific like techniques and

03:37.080 --> 03:39.560
The also tactics as well in the case of

03:40.440 --> 03:46.900
Jiu-Jitsu, so for example in my sport leg locks have always been around. Okay, there's this

03:47.480 --> 03:54.220
No shortage of people you can look back in history who are applying leg locks. Nonetheless, as in across the industry

03:54.720 --> 04:00.560
Leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. There was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport

04:02.000 --> 04:06.320
For most of the history of the sport of Jiu-Jitsu tended to de-emphasize leg locks and

04:08.200 --> 04:15.560
When I looked at them I said there was immense potential but it wasn't being realized and needed to be changed

04:16.560 --> 04:23.440
Since then that has more or less occurred now most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important

04:23.920 --> 04:28.840
Aspect and they're no longer undervalued if anything has gone too far the other way and now perhaps they're a little overvalued

04:29.680 --> 04:31.480
and then

04:31.480 --> 04:33.200
this kind of

04:33.200 --> 04:36.160
fashion trend exists in every industry and

04:37.240 --> 04:41.520
The job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify

04:41.760 --> 04:46.240
Okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued and then

04:47.080 --> 04:51.560
Look at what is their actual objective value and then work

04:52.240 --> 04:56.760
To to to bring them back to the forefront. So John brought up fashion

04:57.280 --> 05:00.160
George is wearing a really sexy shirt. So

05:01.160 --> 05:03.160
Assuming that's not the reason is there

05:03.560 --> 05:08.160
Is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career?

05:08.160 --> 05:13.400
Well, of course everybody knows the famous answer that every athletes are saying

05:13.400 --> 05:18.880
Oh, it could be genetic. I was maybe gifted that certain predisposition. I worked really hard

05:19.720 --> 05:21.720
but I think

05:21.840 --> 05:23.360
something that

05:23.360 --> 05:28.400
People don't talk enough is when everybody sometime go, right? I

05:29.640 --> 05:36.000
Was never afraid to try to go left and I felt many time trying to do things that were not

05:38.360 --> 05:45.160
Known to be things that would bring brought me brought me success, but I I tried it, you know, I was very often

05:45.160 --> 05:49.720
I was the first of trying new things and I felt many time but certain times

05:50.240 --> 05:53.480
it gives me a certain advantage and

05:54.520 --> 05:56.040
for example, I

05:56.040 --> 05:59.600
Was sometime fighting guys that had much better

06:00.120 --> 06:07.080
Wrestling background and then me on paper and nobody before that thought those guys never nobody

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
had there to try to

06:09.320 --> 06:13.080
Take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good

06:13.080 --> 06:17.960
And I didn't have on paper the wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight

06:18.520 --> 06:20.520
but when everybody

06:22.200 --> 06:27.400
Tried to go right I was going left. I fought them in a different way and that was

06:28.120 --> 06:32.200
The blueprint to beat certain some of these guys, you know what I mean? You know what I mean?

06:32.360 --> 06:37.680
You know what I mean, so yeah, so we'll actually talk about a few fights where that you did just that this is fascinating

06:38.240 --> 06:44.520
But let's say at the high level so Gordon again sticking on fashion. May I compliment your?

06:45.120 --> 06:47.120
Incredible badass hat trying to fit in here

06:48.960 --> 06:51.400
We should say we're in Texas now, so he's

06:52.320 --> 06:58.600
Become a Texan overnight. So what is there something you can speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success?

06:58.640 --> 07:02.800
Yeah, so first of all, it has to be a role where you don't ask us all the same questions because

07:03.520 --> 07:05.600
How am I supposed to compete with the answer John just gave?

07:06.440 --> 07:12.320
There's nothing I can do that's gonna top that. Yeah, but uh, I think it's uh, there's many things

07:12.320 --> 07:14.320
But I think the number one thing is just is John

07:14.760 --> 07:19.640
When I came in I was a blue belt and I was beating brown and black belts in competition already

07:20.520 --> 07:23.880
But he really changed my way of thinking about the sport

07:24.040 --> 07:26.040
I would just come in and if something wasn't working

07:26.040 --> 07:33.280
I would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively and that just degenerated me into a degenerated into me

07:33.840 --> 07:39.160
spastically knee sliding into cross-hashi-gurami against Eddie Cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly and

07:40.080 --> 07:43.560
I'm like this is not working and Eddie like when I met him was like a chubby

07:43.960 --> 07:49.360
Librarian looking guy and I'm like there's I'm like six to like a jacked like 170 and I'm like there's no way

07:49.360 --> 07:52.760
I'm losing to a guy who looks like this, but he just kept heel hooking me

07:52.760 --> 07:55.840
So I would just go harder and harder and it wouldn't work and then John's like well

07:56.160 --> 08:01.280
if you learned leg locks you might you might have some more success and then I was like

08:01.280 --> 08:06.680
Yeah, that probably makes sense. And from then on I kind of just changed the way I thought about the sport instead of doing

08:06.680 --> 08:12.480
Doing things harder. I would actually try to get better at your jiu-jitsu. Do you remember like a turning point where?

08:13.760 --> 08:19.320
You became as opposed to being mediocre not just in technique, but in approach to

08:19.480 --> 08:21.320
To great

08:21.320 --> 08:26.280
Um, I think it was somewhere around brown belt level when I was training consistently

08:26.760 --> 08:33.640
Started training full-time with John when I was purple belt mid-level purple belt and towards the end of my brown belt days

08:33.640 --> 08:37.160
I was beating up like legitimate like a DCC champions in the gym

08:38.760 --> 08:40.160
So I think like

08:40.160 --> 08:42.560
Brown to black belt was a big thing for me

08:42.560 --> 08:47.800
And then when I won my first EBI and I was I submitted Yuri who won a DCC and I beat roost them

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
So I think that was like my turning point as a competitor

08:50.720 --> 08:54.760
But I think I started to to reach world level a little bit before that

08:54.760 --> 08:57.120
I think somewhere around brown belt mid level to late level brown belt

08:57.120 --> 09:02.200
It was some of that mental like it was there a moment when you like after a training session

09:02.680 --> 09:05.240
You realized I can actually do this

09:05.640 --> 09:08.040
Like I could be at the top of the world

09:09.040 --> 09:14.160
The critical moment for me was when I think it was right right when I got my black belt

09:14.160 --> 09:16.160
Maybe a few months before I got my black belt

09:16.440 --> 09:19.960
We had a former a DCC champion come into the gym and

09:20.720 --> 09:24.600
we did a hard round together, and I think I submitted him like four or five times and

09:25.360 --> 09:29.080
No one who I was I never won anything up until that point and I was like, okay

09:29.080 --> 09:33.520
Like if this is like one of the best guys in the world and I could submit him multiple times around

09:33.520 --> 09:39.200
I think that this is like something that I actually could do professionally and make a make a career out of this

09:40.040 --> 09:43.520
Okay, so the actual performance was the like you don't need to

09:44.040 --> 09:47.920
Believe before you could perform like a lot of Olympic gold medalist

09:48.960 --> 09:50.040
they

09:50.040 --> 09:56.520
They have to believe before they can perform because like they're getting their ass kicked for a long long long time

09:56.720 --> 09:57.200
Yeah

09:57.200 --> 10:02.280
I think but the best way for me to believe in something is to have repeated success doing it against high-level guys

10:02.280 --> 10:05.600
Like I'm not gonna just believe I can do a double leg if I can't hit a double leg on anybody

10:06.000 --> 10:10.280
So for me the the belief came from the repeated success in the gym

10:10.600 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, but to get to the point where you're submitting somebody like Yuri Samo is like one of the the greatest grapplers ever

10:17.280 --> 10:19.100
It's like a long journey

10:19.100 --> 10:19.600
Yeah

10:19.600 --> 10:25.400
But I had the confidence I had the belief in myself because of the success that I had in the gym prior to that

10:25.400 --> 10:31.920
Got it that event even and it's one step at a time first. It's the brown belts. Then it's the black belts and it's world-class. Okay

10:32.560 --> 10:37.240
George was there a turning point for you when you you thought like I can actually do this

10:38.000 --> 10:39.600
Yes, I am

10:39.840 --> 10:42.200
Always dreamed to become champion

10:42.720 --> 10:48.480
But I think the turning point that there was there was two turning point and there were my two losses

10:50.320 --> 10:54.620
First my losses to Matt Hughes I went into that fight

10:56.240 --> 11:03.580
Just to not lose I was not fighting to win and it's after the fight when I watched the

11:04.220 --> 11:08.140
The replay of the fight I realized I was like I was doing pretty well

11:08.140 --> 11:12.900
But during the fight in my own mind, I was not seeing it that way

11:12.900 --> 11:20.020
I thought I was getting dominated by you was like a hundred percent. But when I watched the replay I

11:20.780 --> 11:27.580
Was like man, I can I can beat this guy. I was beating him until I made that stupid mistake. So I

11:28.100 --> 11:30.100
was very frustrating but but I

11:31.100 --> 11:34.900
That's what gave me the mentally the

11:35.740 --> 11:37.260
Championship level

11:37.260 --> 11:44.860
mentality and then I became a little bit overconfident because I start beating everybody after that and I

11:45.500 --> 11:50.300
Start to believe the hype of people when they look at me. They were like, oh, he's the new

11:51.140 --> 11:57.100
Up-and-coming superstar and he's gonna be unstoppable. And and then when I became champion I I

11:58.060 --> 12:01.560
Lost to to to Matt to Matt Serra, so

12:02.380 --> 12:04.220
before I believe

12:04.220 --> 12:08.100
my first failure was because I had a lack of confidence and

12:09.340 --> 12:17.140
And my second failure was I was because I was over confidence. So I think it's there's a perfect

12:18.140 --> 12:23.820
Center of confidence. I mean, I mean it's good to be confident because John taught me like confidence

12:23.820 --> 12:29.580
it's it's like money in your bank account if you you can have all the skills and in the world, right and and if you're

12:30.020 --> 12:35.360
If you don't have the confidence, it's like you it's like you can you can be a millionaire

12:35.360 --> 12:40.860
But you don't have access to your bank account. So it's that's a little bit the analogy that John told me

12:40.860 --> 12:43.980
So that's how I feel a confidence plays for an athlete

12:43.980 --> 12:50.380
But to be overconfident, I think it's always good to to be aware to be afraid of what can happen

12:50.780 --> 12:56.020
So to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me

12:56.340 --> 13:01.600
That's what mentally gave me the edge to become I believe successful in my sport

13:02.100 --> 13:03.460
playing off that

13:03.460 --> 13:07.060
John gave me a speech one time and he was like you have to be able to

13:08.180 --> 13:14.100
like flip a switch and turn it off where like a guy like Mayweather or someone who goes out who's super confident and

13:14.780 --> 13:17.660
He plays the character of someone. He's like no one can beat me

13:17.660 --> 13:20.020
I'm the best that there ever was and that's it

13:20.420 --> 13:22.300
But if you look at me actually trained very hard

13:22.300 --> 13:27.160
You can't you can't play the persona of no one can beat me and then have it translated into your life and you think that

13:27.160 --> 13:29.660
You're so good that you don't have to do anything and no one could ever beat you

13:29.660 --> 13:32.740
You have to be able to play that public persona of no one could beat me

13:32.740 --> 13:35.740
But then you have to actually do the training to make that happen

13:35.740 --> 13:38.980
You can't just you can't believe your own hype and say that you know

13:38.980 --> 13:40.100
I can just do whatever I want

13:40.100 --> 13:45.660
No one's ever gonna beat me if the open switch between the persona and the actual athlete and that made a big difference for me

13:45.940 --> 13:47.740
It's tough because

13:47.740 --> 13:54.180
like you're you you dominate such a large fraction of the world and in grappling and

13:54.780 --> 13:58.420
The George to just the perfect dominance after those two

13:59.500 --> 14:01.620
it's hard for the confidence not to just

14:03.300 --> 14:07.820
Like how do you avoid the confidence not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely

14:09.140 --> 14:11.140
deludes your mind

14:11.660 --> 14:15.180
For me it's just a number one the guys in the gym are so tough

14:15.180 --> 14:20.460
So the guys in the guys in the gym that I train with are always like nipping at my butt and always giving me new

14:20.460 --> 14:25.460
New problems to solve and for me, it's really just about trying to learn new stuff over time

14:25.740 --> 14:28.180
So that keeps it interesting for me and it's not really about

14:29.900 --> 14:32.220
You know, no one could beat me I don't have to train or have to do it

14:32.220 --> 14:33.300
I could do whatever I want

14:33.300 --> 14:38.420
It's more what keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that I'm learning new stuff all the time of working on

14:38.420 --> 14:43.900
Something new and progressing to new levels at all times. It's not I don't just come in and do the same thing over and over again and

14:44.620 --> 14:49.380
That gets boring. You just come in and you don't learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time

14:49.380 --> 14:50.380
And okay, okay

14:50.380 --> 14:50.940
This is boring

14:50.940 --> 14:56.020
But when you have new stuff to work on and new goals short-term and long-term goals to reach then it makes it interesting

14:56.660 --> 15:02.660
It's a for me. It's a little bit like Gordon says is the fair because sometime in the gym

15:02.780 --> 15:06.420
Even before when it was competing I was I was getting my butt kicked

15:06.860 --> 15:08.940
But I don't care what happened in the gym

15:08.940 --> 15:13.540
I mean it hit my ego of course because I'm a proud person I'm a competitor even in the gym

15:13.660 --> 15:15.660
But it's not a malicious competition

15:16.420 --> 15:20.580
Competition in between each other when you fight you have to be malicious you go there to hurt the guy

15:21.180 --> 15:25.540
but it it hit it hit me in terms of my pride when I get

15:26.220 --> 15:28.500
beat in a gym, of course, but

15:29.220 --> 15:31.220
that fear

15:31.380 --> 15:32.620
That I

15:32.620 --> 15:34.620
Don't want it to happen in public

15:34.860 --> 15:41.620
Especially not during a fight that what keeps help me keeps the balance between confidence and and and and fear

15:41.620 --> 15:44.020
You know what? I mean, it's kind of weird. It's a mix

15:44.500 --> 15:47.780
It's a mixture of both that I believe I

15:48.420 --> 15:49.740
to me

15:49.740 --> 15:51.300
help me

15:51.300 --> 15:57.220
Succeed to have the right mindset to fight and I talked so much shit that I'm like man if I lose this

15:57.460 --> 15:59.780
This is gonna be rough. So yeah

16:00.100 --> 16:05.580
You put a lot of I mean, that's that's the hard thing to do when you talk shit when you when you play the heel

16:06.140 --> 16:11.340
Is so much to perform the pressure is I mean you have to be good under pressure

16:11.540 --> 16:18.100
It's the Conor McGregor thing, you know, the reason I actually started talking shit was actually like indirectly because of George

16:19.060 --> 16:20.100
because

16:20.100 --> 16:23.140
Because I will become the opposite of George one

16:23.140 --> 16:28.720
I won my first EBI and I I didn't talk shit and everyone was like being like, oh, you know

16:28.760 --> 16:32.040
He only beat Yuri because because he was tired or

16:33.000 --> 16:36.900
You know this or that and if they have a rematch under any of the rules that he would have lost

16:37.480 --> 16:39.240
And I'm like trying to figure out what I'm gonna do

16:39.240 --> 16:44.040
so I'm strolling through George's feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone and

16:44.320 --> 16:46.880
I look at the comments and I'm with this in mind

16:46.880 --> 16:50.560
I'm like George is the nicest person of all time. And if you look at the comments

16:50.560 --> 16:55.680
It's like 10,000 comments and like nine thousand and nine hundred are just people calling him

16:55.680 --> 16:59.160
Like all you do is lay and pray you pussy you suck

16:59.160 --> 17:05.280
You can't finish anybody and I'm just I'm looking at this and I'm like people are gonna say what they're gonna say regardless

17:05.400 --> 17:09.320
They're gonna talk shit regardless. So you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself

17:10.480 --> 17:16.440
Is there some aspect that's I mentioned Conor McGregor he he crossed the line with Khabib

17:17.040 --> 17:22.240
At least in the eyes of Khabib. Is there something you ever regret about crossing the line?

17:22.240 --> 17:26.120
Or does that you ever feel like there is a line or do you just keep pushing the line?

17:26.120 --> 17:30.200
Uh, I basically play it per per person

17:30.200 --> 17:36.940
I just I basically fire back with like one step above what what they do. It's always plus one. Yeah. Yeah, okay

17:38.600 --> 17:41.780
So I go I usually go hard like they fire a bullet then I drop a Duke

17:42.240 --> 17:47.480
And then and then after that initial shot then we go back and forth and I'll just keep one upping them

17:47.800 --> 17:53.280
So, you know, there's a lot of people that love you but there's also a lot of people that love to hate you

17:53.320 --> 17:54.600
Yeah

17:54.600 --> 17:55.720
so

17:55.720 --> 17:59.600
like what do those people like energize you or do you just

18:00.560 --> 18:05.320
Or is it funny to you? Like what as an athlete as a performer? You should not think about them

18:05.320 --> 18:08.760
It's like a fun thing. It's like it's just like a fun thing that keeps me occupied

18:09.360 --> 18:14.600
Like because I because most of them that like talk shit they like just say stuff that's factually incorrect

18:14.640 --> 18:18.560
So then I just argue with like actual statistics, yeah, it's just like

18:19.160 --> 18:23.080
You suck or you're not gonna beat this person. I'm like, I've already submitted that guy

18:23.560 --> 18:28.360
So I just it riles them up and it's just it's just a fun thing for me to do my my downtime

18:28.400 --> 18:32.880
Yeah, your responses are usually very factual. It's very scientific. I appreciate

18:33.480 --> 18:40.680
Thank you. You actually you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. Yeah, it's great. Okay, good mix. That's a good mix

18:40.960 --> 18:42.560
I

18:42.560 --> 18:49.240
Mean a topic of haters are more specifically sort of doubts within yourself a doubts around you as you're coming up

18:51.200 --> 18:55.360
Maybe George you can comment. I would just ignore John completely in this conversation. I

18:58.120 --> 19:01.600
Was gonna ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this on this topic

19:02.120 --> 19:08.440
Are there times in your life yet? The you were surrounded by people that doubted you all the time

19:08.440 --> 19:13.400
So what is there something you could say as in by way of advice how you overcome

19:14.000 --> 19:17.920
The doubt either yourself or others around you all the time

19:19.480 --> 19:21.240
The first time I

19:21.240 --> 19:23.240
Manifest my desire to become a professional

19:24.040 --> 19:26.920
Mixed martial art athlete everybody doubt me

19:27.400 --> 19:31.520
Just not even I'm not talking about the UFC just to become a professional fighter

19:31.520 --> 19:37.080
Everybody doubt me and I became a I became a professional fighter. I had few amateur fight

19:37.160 --> 19:40.320
I won them all then I fought my first fight in

19:41.120 --> 19:43.600
Montreal I won and I became a professional

19:44.240 --> 19:51.480
Then I I told people that I wanted to fight in UFC. Everybody doubt me again. So it's a normal thing

19:52.560 --> 19:59.360
so I work my way up beat a few guys then I at the time Pete Spratt was

20:00.040 --> 20:03.360
just not knocked out Robbie Lawler with leg kick and

20:03.480 --> 20:08.760
The person who was my agent at the time did a great move for me

20:08.760 --> 20:12.760
So he brought Pete Spratt and Montreal to fight me Pete Spratt came to Montreal

20:12.760 --> 20:15.680
I and I believe he didn't know who I was

20:15.680 --> 20:20.600
So he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and I and I end up beating him

20:20.600 --> 20:23.800
So that gave me the opportunity to fight in UFC

20:24.480 --> 20:27.920
Then after I was in UFC, I wanted to become champion of the world, you know

20:27.920 --> 20:31.580
But Matthews was there and he seems invincible at the time. So

20:32.420 --> 20:38.580
Everybody doubt me again and I became world champion and after when you when I was a world champion. I wanted to be I

20:39.500 --> 20:43.820
Was competing against other world champion of other weight class

20:44.460 --> 20:48.100
For the title, you know for the legacy and everything

20:48.100 --> 20:52.500
So it's not no longer competing against my opponent was you know as a competitor

20:52.820 --> 20:58.620
You always you never wanted to be you never want to be satisfied because when satisfaction is the death

20:58.940 --> 21:06.380
You know when you're satisfied you better retire because it's over so always have to find motivation what you can have more

21:06.380 --> 21:10.580
I want more don't be satisfied in life. So I wanted to be

21:11.380 --> 21:14.700
Like the best, you know, I want as I was competing, you know

21:14.700 --> 21:19.820
Like to become the best and and you know, of course that people doubt doubt you all the time

21:19.860 --> 21:25.620
Every time you say something that it's outside of the norm of the normality

21:25.780 --> 21:33.100
When I say there's nothing normal but I'm talking about when you you manifest your desire to do something that

21:33.940 --> 21:35.100
takes

21:35.100 --> 21:41.580
Special attribute to to to succeed or that is something that is hard to do it for sure

21:41.580 --> 21:48.380
You're gonna always have people that doubt you it's so strange that people don't they don't lean into supporting like people that love you, too

21:48.500 --> 21:54.460
yeah, even people that love me used to doubt me and I believe I you need to use that as

21:56.260 --> 22:00.260
Positive positive thing as a motivation to prove them wrong

22:00.380 --> 22:05.580
Yeah, so for me that that was a thing when someone doubt me nothing gave me more

22:06.340 --> 22:12.060
There's more energy because I want to prove him wrong. I want to look at him in the face and say hey, you see

22:12.060 --> 22:14.500
I got you man. I I did it

22:15.020 --> 22:15.940
so

22:15.940 --> 22:19.020
John do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying?

22:19.020 --> 22:24.540
I don't think you can do this to motivate them to prove you wrong or more general question of

22:25.620 --> 22:31.760
You know the the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness

22:31.980 --> 22:37.140
Like what's your role as a coach when you have these two athletes with regards to your first question?

22:37.340 --> 22:44.060
Would I ever say to someone you can't do this as a kind of reverse psychology? I know

22:46.060 --> 22:54.180
My job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills and as Gordon pointed out earlier if you're in

22:54.620 --> 23:01.220
In any way a rational human being and you're noticing that you're getting tremendous success

23:01.620 --> 23:05.140
with a given move in the gym against high-level opponents who

23:05.820 --> 23:09.960
Give a good read on what your actual opponent in a competition is is like

23:10.860 --> 23:12.860
You would have to be a moron to

23:13.980 --> 23:19.040
Not recognize that kind of success and say this is something I should be building into my game

23:19.040 --> 23:23.540
And you will carry the confidence that you earned in the gym into the arena

23:24.540 --> 23:28.660
So I never try to use reverse psychology I build up

23:30.300 --> 23:33.500
Everything I do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills

23:33.500 --> 23:39.420
I know people say all this physicality on the one hand is mentality on the other and confidence is

23:40.020 --> 23:44.900
squarely in the the mental aspect of the game, but all the underpinnings and

23:45.420 --> 23:47.940
beginnings of confidence are physical

23:48.940 --> 23:55.300
Okay, a rational human being will see where they're having success and where they're having failure and

23:55.940 --> 23:57.740
confidence will

23:57.740 --> 24:03.820
Surround those areas where they're having success and will degenerate in cases where they're having failure

24:04.260 --> 24:10.620
So my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills and

24:10.900 --> 24:12.900
I don't have to do anything

24:14.140 --> 24:16.140
psychologically after that I just

24:16.900 --> 24:19.260
If I can set you up to be highly successful

24:19.860 --> 24:25.020
With a given move or a set of tactics ten times in a row against quality opposition in the gym

24:25.020 --> 24:29.120
I don't have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. I

24:29.700 --> 24:33.320
Will tell people hey, you're doing a really good job with that move. It's working well for you

24:34.100 --> 24:35.580
but

24:35.580 --> 24:39.420
When they nod in agreement, I'm not trying to force anything on them

24:39.460 --> 24:43.660
They're recognized they or they already recognize that long before the words came out of my mouth

24:44.180 --> 24:51.940
But on the other hand intelligent rational people will recognize when they're failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part

24:51.940 --> 24:53.940
Can never change that

24:53.980 --> 24:56.180
if I teach Gordon a

24:57.340 --> 24:59.340
given arm lock and

24:59.660 --> 25:04.200
15 times in a row he tries it over a month and all 15 are failures

25:04.380 --> 25:08.100
There's nothing I can say verbally to come up to Gordon say hey, you're really good at their move

25:08.100 --> 25:09.540
He's gonna look at me say bullshit

25:09.580 --> 25:15.420
I'm terrible at it and that will create a crisis of confidence where Gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth

25:15.940 --> 25:22.140
So I will never compromise that but isn't there a lot you just said 15 there you have to believe

25:23.260 --> 25:24.820
that

25:24.820 --> 25:30.060
Doing this armlock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it

25:30.060 --> 25:33.980
I think yeah, that's a separate issue that that's a separate issue that

25:34.140 --> 25:36.140
I

25:37.020 --> 25:44.580
There are times where I've more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction for example

25:45.180 --> 25:47.740
When I first met Gary Tone and he never had a guillotine

25:48.140 --> 25:50.500
Strangle and I I would say don't carry you know

25:50.820 --> 25:57.780
You're a scrambler like one of the greatest weapons of scrambler can ever develop as a guillotine like it should be in your arsenal and

25:58.660 --> 26:02.540
He was like no I just scramble for the back and I said well, there's gonna be a day

26:02.540 --> 26:07.420
You can't take someone's back and it's always good to better strangle from front and back

26:07.660 --> 26:10.840
Okay, of course, we all prefer strangles on the back that makes sense

26:11.140 --> 26:14.220
But there's gonna come a day where it's gonna be useful for you

26:14.220 --> 26:19.020
and so that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said you're learning this shut the fuck up and

26:20.660 --> 26:25.780
Like literally wouldn't teach him any anything else until he got a guillotine. Yeah, Gary like asked him a question

26:25.780 --> 26:27.780
he's like, let's say you're guillotine and

26:28.420 --> 26:29.700
And

26:29.700 --> 26:36.380
For the first three months as gifted as is Gary Tone and isn't learning most moves most moves Gary gets it like

26:36.900 --> 26:42.420
in minutes there was something going on with Gary just couldn't get a guillotine on people and

26:43.660 --> 26:49.580
Finally after around three months. He started having some success until ultimately became one of his best weapons

26:50.780 --> 26:57.660
We had to go through like 15 different variations of guillotine until he found one which actually worked reliably for him

26:57.820 --> 27:01.660
And that was one of the few times where I put my foot down and said no

27:01.860 --> 27:05.660
Do you have to learn this the long search had to do more with the physical?

27:05.860 --> 27:08.500
Characteristics like you couldn't figure out the right like it made sense

27:08.500 --> 27:14.620
It made sense in the case of Gary Tone because there were more opportunities per minute of his grappling for guillotines

27:15.180 --> 27:18.500
That the investment and time was worth it for another athlete

27:18.500 --> 27:21.980
I might have said well, he hardly ever gets in the situation for front headlongs of guillotine

27:21.980 --> 27:24.300
So it's not even worth investing the training time

27:24.940 --> 27:28.660
Let me ask you a question on the on the competition side mentioned haters

27:28.660 --> 27:36.320
And do you think about this aspect of the competition with athletes is this is a great question and the answer is no

27:38.660 --> 27:39.940
I'm

27:39.940 --> 27:44.820
You can see that you could you couldn't find two more polar opposites

27:45.700 --> 27:50.780
psychologically than the George St. Pierre and this monstrosity on my left and

27:50.820 --> 27:57.940
I've I've never said to my athletes. Hey, I think this is the sort of demeanor

27:57.940 --> 28:01.840
You should carry yourself with I'm myself a very flawed

28:02.420 --> 28:07.900
Character and I'm the last person on earth who should be delving out moral advice to other people

28:08.820 --> 28:10.460
the only thing is that I

28:10.460 --> 28:13.020
You know, of course, I believe some things are off limits

28:13.100 --> 28:19.740
But as long as it's done in the context of sport where no one's physically attacking people or do anything crazy where it just goes completely

28:19.740 --> 28:23.380
Over-the-top, then I give almost zero

28:24.740 --> 28:27.500
Moral advice to my athletes. I'm a jiu-jitsu coach not a preacher

28:28.660 --> 28:30.840
Alex I if I can if I may

28:31.860 --> 28:33.860
We are entertainers

28:34.180 --> 28:37.460
You know, we're athletes for professional athlete, but we make

28:38.500 --> 28:43.940
We make a living because of people are want to see us perform

28:44.540 --> 28:48.420
Same thing an actor is something a singer and a lot of the time

28:49.420 --> 28:51.420
Especially in the fight game

28:52.140 --> 28:57.820
An event is promoted. It needs to be with emotion

28:58.940 --> 29:01.580
Love me hate me, but do not ignore me

29:02.660 --> 29:04.220
and

29:04.220 --> 29:05.700
you know it

29:05.700 --> 29:09.500
When it's authentic and it's done

29:09.500 --> 29:14.540
well, I think me my personally my my favorite fighters to watch are the one that are that that

29:15.340 --> 29:21.460
That have a sort of some sort of a bad persona I really enjoyed watching those guys because

29:22.420 --> 29:27.020
They bring an emotion element into a fight, which is great. You know, I

29:27.740 --> 29:33.500
Feel to me. It's more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved and I believe that's why

29:34.340 --> 29:38.060
Some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know what?

29:38.060 --> 29:41.540
I mean, that's the reason why we may we can make a living out of this

29:41.540 --> 29:47.620
Yeah, they're better entertainers, but you're right the authenticity seems to be really important there. It's actually something very interesting then

29:48.140 --> 29:50.500
It's time to break out some some secrets

29:52.420 --> 29:57.660
Do you know who like you think of George St. Peter you think of like the highly technical polished

29:58.940 --> 30:00.460
martial artist

30:00.460 --> 30:05.380
Do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were?

30:06.100 --> 30:10.260
You'd probably be thinking of probably someone who's really technically advanced

30:10.820 --> 30:11.860
Actually

30:11.860 --> 30:16.220
It was Mark Coleman. Oh, no, Kevin Randleman and Phil Barone

30:16.740 --> 30:22.140
He used to love watching that was a hammer house. That was his favorite. He would love those guys and

30:22.900 --> 30:26.340
whenever their flights were on George we watching the hammer house crew and

30:28.020 --> 30:32.940
It's funny what you said about how those guys bought an intensity to

30:33.620 --> 30:37.140
To MMA that was off the charts. Have you ever met those guys in?

30:38.140 --> 30:42.220
In their prime, let me tell you it was it was something to behold and

30:42.820 --> 30:45.380
I had this crazy larger-than-life

30:45.940 --> 30:47.260
personality

30:47.260 --> 30:49.460
Most of the things I did made no sense whatsoever

30:49.660 --> 30:56.180
But mean technically but that was their appeal and and there were these guys and just George loved to watch them more than anyone else

30:56.180 --> 31:01.420
You never knew what what could happen with these guys. I remember when Mark Coleman won the pride Grand Prix

31:01.420 --> 31:04.780
I was in my living room. I was jumping. I was so happy. I was like, yeah

31:05.660 --> 31:08.420
He beat Igor Varchevchin that was like

31:09.220 --> 31:11.580
Like to me, it was amazing. You know what I mean?

31:12.220 --> 31:16.780
Because of the emotion that they brought into the fight George is actually very

31:17.660 --> 31:20.540
interested by something you said there normally when I

31:22.100 --> 31:24.380
Asked what is the appeal of a given fighter?

31:25.140 --> 31:32.220
And what makes people watch a fight you talked about the idea that fighters entertainers and that's absolutely correct that they are

31:33.220 --> 31:36.780
It's this weird weird industry where you're you're

31:37.420 --> 31:42.780
Both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become

31:43.740 --> 31:46.220
financially successful in so far as

31:47.300 --> 31:54.180
Your favorite athletes to watch at least were people who are almost like the polar opposite of who you are

31:55.220 --> 31:58.700
I've always said that most people if you look at

31:59.700 --> 32:02.700
Say a million people watch a pay-per-view event

32:03.500 --> 32:07.660
What percentage of those million people have a genuine?

32:08.180 --> 32:12.220
Technical understanding of what's happening as they watch a fight

32:12.980 --> 32:14.980
It's tiny

32:15.380 --> 32:23.140
It's absolutely tiny the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no

32:23.380 --> 32:25.380
technical understanding of

32:25.420 --> 32:33.320
What's going on in front of them, so how do they relate to the fight? What's the only way they can it's through emotion and

32:34.460 --> 32:37.620
So when they get a sense that these two don't like each other

32:38.140 --> 32:40.140
Then they can relate to the fight

32:40.340 --> 32:46.460
But only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level

32:46.820 --> 32:51.420
The overwhelming majority will always form an emotional attachment to the fight

32:51.540 --> 32:56.140
That's why when you see things shows that USC primetime they never focus on

32:57.060 --> 33:01.300
Tactics and the techniques of the fight they focus on the emotional elements the

33:01.660 --> 33:05.220
Preparation the view of their own family members as athletes get ready

33:05.260 --> 33:12.900
It's always an emotional pull because that's how 99% of the viewers relate to the fight if I even think about chess

33:13.180 --> 33:17.260
Okay, if I have minimal knowledge of two world champions

33:18.100 --> 33:22.620
Coming to fight each other in it or match up against each other in a game of chess

33:22.620 --> 33:28.260
I know so little about chess tactics, and I can't really form any kind of technical

33:29.180 --> 33:31.180
appreciation of what's going on on the board

33:31.580 --> 33:34.820
But if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other's guts

33:34.820 --> 33:37.220
And they've got a rivalry which goes back five years

33:37.220 --> 33:42.620
And they've said this and that about each other in public then suddenly on my ears prick up, and I'm like oh, okay

33:42.620 --> 33:44.620
This sounds interesting

33:45.260 --> 33:51.540
Because I just don't have the the knowledge to appreciate what's going on on the board and a chess game to be able to

33:51.980 --> 33:53.980
to appreciate the

33:54.300 --> 33:56.900
technical nuances of what they're doing so any

33:57.900 --> 34:02.980
Interest that I have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because I'm just not qualified

34:03.180 --> 34:09.300
To make technical assessments, and that's exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts

34:09.620 --> 34:15.220
That's why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal

34:15.420 --> 34:17.860
Conor McGregor was the all-time master of this I

34:18.500 --> 34:20.500
believe also

34:20.940 --> 34:22.940
Emotion can be used as a weapon

34:23.820 --> 34:28.700
For example I've learned I've learned this from my favorite boxer is Chagre Leonard

34:29.460 --> 34:36.420
Chagre Leonard I remember I was very young so I watched his fight later when I was older, but I know that Chagre Leonard

34:37.020 --> 34:43.780
Was the best boxer of his era to me personally, and I don't think nobody could beat him

34:43.780 --> 34:46.940
I think it was skill skill wise it was the best however

34:47.660 --> 34:50.300
When he fought in Montreal Roberto Duran

34:51.620 --> 34:53.620
Roberto Duran

34:55.700 --> 35:01.780
Made it in a way that Leonard became very emotional he wanted to stand in front of Duran and

35:02.380 --> 35:08.140
Fight a different fight that that he normally does because he wanted to show that he's a man and

35:09.180 --> 35:11.380
He lost that fight which was a mistake

35:12.140 --> 35:13.860
so by by

35:13.860 --> 35:18.740
Then later on he beat Roberto Duran in quite easy. You know if the fair

35:19.380 --> 35:22.580
everybody remembered a no-mass thing, but my point is

35:24.100 --> 35:28.620
Emotion can be used in a way that it can make your

35:29.140 --> 35:35.660
Derail your opponent out of his game plan, and I felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me

35:35.820 --> 35:39.940
So that's why I never got involved that was my way to defend myself against

35:41.100 --> 35:45.700
some kind of bullying to put like a like a shield in front but some other guy like

35:47.020 --> 35:53.540
Gordon he expressed himself differently of course. There's a language barrier, but for him. He's better at

35:54.460 --> 35:58.020
Giving giving giving back that says he's a better counter attacker

35:58.020 --> 36:04.300
You know that's the way you respond to to to the aggression of a of an American emotional attack

36:04.300 --> 36:09.140
I think everybody is different in that regards. What's interesting that John said that he doesn't

36:11.820 --> 36:13.900
Study the tactics of this game

36:13.900 --> 36:19.900
Or maybe you're not interested in the tactics of this game because it seems like this is more than just being an entertainer

36:19.900 --> 36:25.740
It seems like it could be an effective part of the match. Yeah, I just feel like whatever investment you make in that is

36:27.940 --> 36:33.540
It's going to get negligible rewards first of all it's probably going to pertain to one match in front of you rather than the

36:33.540 --> 36:35.540
totality of your career and

36:36.180 --> 36:39.660
Whatever gains you get out of psychological trickery and play

36:41.940 --> 36:43.940
Typically

36:44.580 --> 36:50.620
Don't last long you you've raised an excellent example with sugar rate Leonard. He did fight outside of his usual

36:51.820 --> 36:56.100
Manner in that regard, but rather than me try to tell someone hey

36:56.940 --> 36:58.500
Behave like this before a fight

36:58.500 --> 37:04.900
I would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and say no no you're fighting this fight the wrong way and

37:05.100 --> 37:06.900
That would have a much

37:06.900 --> 37:07.980
more

37:07.980 --> 37:10.020
beneficial impact on my athletes and

37:10.820 --> 37:14.580
Psychological trickery before a fight. I believe another example of

37:16.060 --> 37:18.060
Emotion that leads to failure is

37:19.020 --> 37:21.420
Jose Aldo against Conor McGregor

37:21.420 --> 37:29.380
I think it was it was on purpose that Conor McGregor did this try to bait Aldo to become over

37:29.380 --> 37:33.340
Aggressive to open himself because he's an excellent counter puncher puncher

37:34.140 --> 37:36.460
That's what I believe he made a mistake

37:37.420 --> 37:40.360
There's another great one my match against cyborg

37:41.460 --> 37:44.340
2018 no gee worlds where he didn't even try to win

37:44.460 --> 37:48.820
he just like wanted to smack me in the face the whole time cuz he was so angry that I was talking shit to

37:48.820 --> 37:50.300
him before the match and

37:50.300 --> 37:52.980
It was like the finals of the absolute it was like the biggest

37:53.420 --> 37:57.060
Match of the weekend, and he just didn't even try to pass my guard or do anything

37:57.060 --> 38:00.180
He just wanted to hit me in the face, and I was like sick. I just won

38:00.820 --> 38:06.800
It was incredibly frustrating to watch like a grown man sort of lose composure

38:08.700 --> 38:13.540
Gordon one thing I've always been very impressed with you and that's

38:15.220 --> 38:17.660
No matter how heated talk gets

38:18.660 --> 38:23.620
Before a match with you when you go out to grapple you're absolutely cold

38:24.260 --> 38:27.100
Like I've you've never gone into a match

38:27.820 --> 38:34.980
Carrying anything other than just cold-blooded calculation and you've always been able to separate very well

38:35.780 --> 38:40.180
the idea of words and deeds and I think that's always been one of your

38:40.900 --> 38:46.260
One of your strongest assets a way. I often measure this is when a match is over

38:46.260 --> 38:50.060
I will ask the athlete questions about the match and

38:50.980 --> 38:55.300
If they can't answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute? Okay?

38:55.300 --> 39:02.180
What was that setup you used in in the third minute that got you into the Kimura lock if they can't answer that that tells me

39:02.580 --> 39:07.740
They were just fighting on instincts and emotion, but with Gordon. It's like a log book

39:09.180 --> 39:11.380
It's like okay in the seventh minute you went for that

39:12.260 --> 39:15.140
Jujutsu Tommy set up from from on the left side

39:15.860 --> 39:19.860
What were you thinking? He can always give an answer. He's absolutely stone-cold

39:22.500 --> 39:24.500
Speaking of emotion

39:25.540 --> 39:33.060
Gordon you will will potentially if you're healthy face Andre Galvao and the ADCC coming up super fight

39:33.780 --> 39:38.740
Who is Andre Galvao for people who don't know? Can you tell the story of your beef with?

39:39.940 --> 39:45.060
The the emotional interaction with a man. Yeah, so Andre is a

39:45.820 --> 39:47.820
He's considered the greatest

39:48.100 --> 39:50.020
ADCC competitor of all time

39:50.020 --> 39:52.020
multiple-time black belt world champion

39:52.580 --> 39:56.420
Winningest ADCC champion ever he has six six gold medals and

39:57.620 --> 39:59.620
I've been trying to compete against him

40:00.340 --> 40:05.060
Pretty much forever. Like since I got my black belt in 2016. I've been trying to get matches with him

40:05.460 --> 40:10.700
he was in the first EBI that I did and he ended up pulling out and that I've been trying to get matches with him and

40:12.100 --> 40:16.340
he would always say no and give one reason or another and then

40:17.300 --> 40:23.300
After the last ADCC I was like hey Andre said he was retiring after this after this

40:23.940 --> 40:29.660
This competition so if he wants to retire, you know, he's he's the greatest ADCC competitor of all time

40:29.660 --> 40:34.740
And I think it's great. But if he wants to compete and that's great. I was like super nice and then he started like

40:35.940 --> 40:37.940
posting like passive-aggressive Instagram

40:39.820 --> 40:41.180
Captions and

40:41.180 --> 40:46.060
Then we started going back and forth in the internet and it was like one point where I saw him in person

40:46.180 --> 40:47.980
when he

40:47.980 --> 40:49.980
Acknowledged he's like I understand like what you're doing

40:49.980 --> 40:51.980
Like we're gonna pump this fight up and he was like totally on board

40:52.300 --> 40:57.660
but then there must have been something that happened where like it changed from like him like going along with it to being like

40:57.660 --> 40:58.980
actually pissed and

40:58.980 --> 41:03.420
then there was that one night at flow where I went to go shake his hand and he he flipped me off and then he

41:03.460 --> 41:07.260
followed me backstage and started to try to fight me and then I smacked him and

41:08.300 --> 41:13.540
Then he didn't want to fight anymore. And then we've been going back. He's actually blocked me on Instagram now

41:13.580 --> 41:17.060
So he just won't engage no one from ATOS will engage now

41:17.060 --> 41:21.320
But it's gonna be interesting how he how he shows up if he can keep it under control or not

41:21.460 --> 41:26.900
Do you think how do you explain that level of emotion? Is this fear of losing your throne?

41:26.900 --> 41:30.540
Is it is it just the human being like with the cyborg just?

41:31.220 --> 41:37.260
Just becoming emotionally unstable. Well, it might just be me. I just have a way to get get under people's skin

41:37.260 --> 41:42.600
It's just I don't know. He's he's he was he was cool for a while and then I just I don't know. It's just

41:43.700 --> 41:48.980
Everyone gets like this. They're all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it's pretty easy to read them

41:48.980 --> 41:55.300
They're either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and and beat me like like Tim Spriggs is a perfect example at ABCC

41:55.300 --> 41:57.300
I posted like

41:57.700 --> 42:00.380
On my story on Instagram like 10 minutes before a match

42:00.380 --> 42:06.820
I said like what I'm gonna do to Tim Spriggs is gonna be criminal and he's like a very stalling guy and he came

42:06.820 --> 42:09.260
He saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me

42:09.260 --> 42:12.180
Like he came and actually engaged my guard and I ended up submitting him

42:12.180 --> 42:17.560
So it either has that effect or it has the effect where they know I've talked so much shit leading up to the match

42:17.860 --> 42:22.220
That they're so afraid to lose that they just get super stalling and they move away

42:22.220 --> 42:26.980
So it either has one effect where they come forward and they want to they want to beat me beat me or they want to just

42:26.980 --> 42:29.460
They're so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage

42:29.460 --> 42:34.320
They're super cagey and they just back away and don't really do anything. Do you think this match happens?

42:35.500 --> 42:41.100
There's a lot of variables and what I have to see how my stomach is and two if I'm actually gonna show up and compete

42:41.100 --> 42:44.740
My stomach's healthy. I doubt that Andre will actually show up to compete

42:44.900 --> 42:48.260
I've been trying to compete against them for six years and he hasn't done it

42:48.260 --> 42:54.340
So there's no reason to think he would now is it possible for you to speak to where like your estimates are about your stomach

42:54.340 --> 43:00.780
Or is it too unclear for now still too early to tell I have this round of treatment that I'm doing until late February

43:00.780 --> 43:03.420
And I'm pretty sure that they need to do the same test

43:03.420 --> 43:07.020
They did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there

43:07.060 --> 43:11.460
So I've been feeling a little bit better like it's not nearly as bad as it used to be

43:11.460 --> 43:15.180
I was explaining to someone the other day like for the last four years

43:15.180 --> 43:18.660
I would be so nauseous that every time I would walk into a new room

43:18.660 --> 43:22.640
I'd have to actively locate a garbage can in case I have to throw up

43:22.660 --> 43:26.060
So I'm like one step above that right now. I'm like doing a little bit better than that

43:26.300 --> 43:29.540
So it's definitely getting a little bit better, but it's not it's not where it needs to be

43:30.380 --> 43:36.280
Can we talk about diet for just a sec because both of you George and and Gordon?

43:37.020 --> 43:44.060
Like suffered from stomach issues different kind and have arrived for now for different places

43:44.220 --> 43:46.500
so can you maybe George speak to

43:47.820 --> 43:54.180
The general question of what is the best diet for performance for training like what have you learned through your career about this?

43:54.180 --> 43:56.180
Well, I think everybody is different

43:57.100 --> 43:59.100
to me personally

44:00.940 --> 44:02.940
Implement fasting

44:03.580 --> 44:05.580
Time restricted eating and

44:05.820 --> 44:12.140
Prolonged fasting. What's the longest you've done so far? The longest I've done is five days. I do it quite often

44:12.140 --> 44:14.620
I do I do four times a year. I do

44:15.420 --> 44:17.260
three to five days

44:17.260 --> 44:19.260
water fast

44:19.260 --> 44:25.340
And I liked it. It helps me with inflammation. I think it boosts the immune system and

44:26.060 --> 44:32.540
that this about the red papers about about this and I it helps me was also feel

44:33.420 --> 44:38.700
Good. It's kind of a threat very therapeutic to physical and mental just mental

44:39.500 --> 44:45.980
mental and physical because when I eat my when I break my fast and I sit at the table with with other people

44:47.020 --> 44:50.140
It doesn't matter what I eat if we all eat the same thing

44:50.220 --> 44:57.180
I always tell them I said my my food right now tastes better than all of yours, you know because I you know, I

44:57.660 --> 44:59.740
I have this

44:59.820 --> 45:06.380
Thing that I think I believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how

45:07.320 --> 45:09.580
pleasurable something is and

45:11.020 --> 45:12.060
I

45:12.060 --> 45:13.340
tend

45:13.340 --> 45:16.380
Personally like diet wise I eat whatever I want

45:17.100 --> 45:20.620
Whenever I want I don't I no longer have any problem with this

45:21.740 --> 45:24.540
but if I would have a competition coming up like

45:25.260 --> 45:28.460
Knowing that I what I know now about my body I would

45:29.180 --> 45:33.660
Orient myself more more towards an animal based diet

45:34.460 --> 45:39.500
That's because I've tried different things and that's the kind of diet that I believe helped me

45:40.460 --> 45:46.700
Having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for for for doing something physical

45:46.780 --> 45:48.860
So high protein high fat low carbs

45:49.820 --> 45:51.180
well

45:51.180 --> 45:57.500
This is is different between animal based diet and keto. I mean there's carbs. There's a lot of fruit

45:57.820 --> 46:03.180
I got a lot of the the carbs from the fruit. Okay, a lot of organs organs

46:05.740 --> 46:10.140
I know a little bit about paleontology and the the past of on

46:11.100 --> 46:13.980
About prehistoric human and I I know that

46:14.700 --> 46:15.660
um

46:15.660 --> 46:18.300
And not only about that. I know because I've traveled

46:18.860 --> 46:23.340
Certain place in the world. I want to to visit the Maasai in africa the yantar gathered tribe

46:23.340 --> 46:25.900
And I know that when they kill an animal

46:26.620 --> 46:31.500
They go for the organs first and I know a pretty most predatory animal they do the same thing

46:31.580 --> 46:37.340
So organs I believe is something that normally in in our culture in in the western part of the world

46:37.340 --> 46:40.240
We don't really eat but it's something that is very nutritious

46:41.500 --> 46:44.000
Have you been able to convince gordon to try fasting?

46:45.980 --> 46:47.980
We always talk about diets

46:48.300 --> 46:53.260
It's a different situation. I think for gordon because he's an heavyweight. He doesn't want to lose weight

46:53.340 --> 46:59.420
You know when they heavyweight the range of uh, like my my range was like I was a welterweight and middleweight

46:59.420 --> 47:03.260
But the heavyweight it's like some of the guys that you compete can compete against there

47:03.500 --> 47:05.500
They might be 300 pounds. So

47:05.900 --> 47:07.740
If you lose weight

47:07.740 --> 47:09.820
It's a it's a big problem. You know what I mean? So

47:10.700 --> 47:14.300
And there are things that will work for me that might not work for gordon, you know

47:14.380 --> 47:18.620
So you have to make his own experience and and I told gordon sometime when everybody goes left

47:18.700 --> 47:22.460
You try to go right see how you feel with certain things experiment

47:23.180 --> 47:25.180
Not not a topic, uh

47:25.500 --> 47:27.500
That's part of your optimization

47:27.740 --> 47:29.500
optimal performance formula

47:29.500 --> 47:35.820
Well, uh what I used to do before my stomach issues and for those of you listening who don't know I had recurring staph infections in

47:36.360 --> 47:41.340
2018 and I took a bunch of oral antibiotics and I just completely wiped out my stomach

47:41.420 --> 47:45.760
So I just was diagnosed. It was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis

47:45.980 --> 47:51.660
So for those of you messaging me on instagram who are just watching rogan asking me about my gastroparesis. That's not what I have

47:52.140 --> 47:57.340
Um, they misdiagnosed it and uh, I did some other tests and for four years. I didn't even know what it was

47:58.140 --> 48:01.180
and then I got this uh, I went to this doctor in california who

48:01.740 --> 48:07.580
Uh diagnosed me with i've h pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestines

48:07.740 --> 48:12.060
So the issues in the small intestines, um, so what I used to do was I used to do like

48:12.620 --> 48:16.460
seasons where i'd have a very clean season where I was competing and I would

48:16.860 --> 48:21.260
Have a lower body weight and then I would do like an off season kind of like a bodybuilder where I would eat

48:21.660 --> 48:27.580
A lot more food and a little bit dirtier food and I would have cheeseburgers and pizza at night time to have the extra calories

48:27.980 --> 48:30.620
Um, but now I can't eat those foods because they upset my stomach

48:30.780 --> 48:34.460
So now I pretty much just try to eat whatever I can and maintain the weight the best I can

48:34.860 --> 48:37.900
Um based on how my stomach feels. So right now it's like

48:38.460 --> 48:40.060
rice chicken

48:40.060 --> 48:41.740
eggs fish

48:41.740 --> 48:43.580
vegetables fruits

48:43.580 --> 48:46.060
And pretty much nothing else like anything hard to digest

48:46.620 --> 48:51.020
Uh, anything spicy red meat fast food all that's

48:51.340 --> 48:52.780
All that's hard for me

48:52.780 --> 48:55.980
Which sucks because in texas all the best things. Yeah barbecue

48:57.740 --> 49:01.340
And I mean this diet is really important for you john I can tell um

49:02.620 --> 49:08.940
Like is it is that something you think about for athletes at all again? This is part of the no i've i've um to be honest with you

49:09.820 --> 49:12.300
I've never seen any measurable

49:13.000 --> 49:16.780
Improvement in sports performance in jiu-jitsu by change of diet

49:17.740 --> 49:20.700
I do believe that diet is important for longevity

49:21.340 --> 49:25.420
In human beings and I do think it makes a difference, especially once you get past the age of 40

49:26.780 --> 49:28.700
With regards longevity

49:28.700 --> 49:32.060
Uh for older athletes, I do believe it makes some difference

49:32.300 --> 49:37.500
But my observation is in athletes and in their youth and working up into their prime

49:38.060 --> 49:40.540
I've seen athletes have the worst

49:41.180 --> 49:43.180
diets, um

49:43.740 --> 49:48.860
God bless travis stevens for that guy won olympic silver medal basically on mcdonald's and candy. Yeah

49:48.940 --> 49:50.220
um

49:50.220 --> 49:55.020
George st. Pierre for 80 percent of your career you were powered by mcdonald's and coca-cola

49:55.500 --> 49:57.580
The two genealfredo that was my yeah

49:58.300 --> 50:05.980
My meal of choice before a championship fight, uh gordon for him his youth was just five guys hamburgers gary tonnen same thing

50:06.700 --> 50:12.060
I've worked with japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won olympic gold medals

50:12.460 --> 50:16.460
Um, i've worked with russian wrestlers who just ate

50:18.540 --> 50:23.340
Whatever was put in front of them and their athletic performance was outstanding

50:23.980 --> 50:28.220
Um, i've worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and

50:28.860 --> 50:32.620
Their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. So i've i've never

50:33.420 --> 50:39.420
I've never seen someone say, okay, I changed my diet and because of that there was a measurable

50:40.200 --> 50:47.660
Improvement in sports performance another way to phrase it though is um, I have noticed with a lot of elite athletes what they eat

50:48.300 --> 50:50.300
They begin to believe that that

50:50.540 --> 50:56.940
Either is not a hindrance or it's actually good like travis steve is an example of somebody who eats shitty

50:57.580 --> 50:59.180
because he believes

50:59.180 --> 51:01.180
It's like it's like a power because

51:01.500 --> 51:05.820
Whatever he's traveling across the world. He can't rely on healthy good food to be there

51:05.820 --> 51:07.660
So i'm going to eat shitty

51:07.660 --> 51:14.780
So that that's the like my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever everywhere's got mcdonald's everywhere's got mcdonald's

51:14.780 --> 51:20.860
So that makes like and they've convinced themselves and you talk about russian athletes a lot of them have very

51:21.900 --> 51:23.900
strong beliefs about like this

51:24.300 --> 51:29.820
About particular food being good for them, but there's no agreement among them exactly no agreement

51:29.820 --> 51:32.780
Yeah, yeah, so belief is more important than the actual time. Yeah

51:33.740 --> 51:40.300
I'm sorry if I can after you know after a night out when you're hanging over

51:41.500 --> 51:45.520
I think the best thing and and i'm saying this in all sincerity

51:45.900 --> 51:50.860
I think the best thing to eat to me was like like cheeseburgers with

51:51.580 --> 51:56.060
We call that a putin back home because it's very fat. It's greasy

51:56.380 --> 52:01.740
So the next day when you wake up, I think you feel better because it absorbed the alcohol

52:02.860 --> 52:04.460
You can train

52:04.460 --> 52:10.380
My mom told me the same story once and then I try I was like I was hung over for some party

52:10.780 --> 52:14.540
And uh, I woke up. I was like probably I don't know 19 or 20. I woke up

52:15.020 --> 52:19.580
And uh, my mom's like, yeah, just have a have a cheeseburger go go eat something greasy

52:19.740 --> 52:21.660
And I did and I was like, oh I feel kind of better now

52:22.220 --> 52:28.620
I do not know the science the exact science behind it, but I I I always notice and I don't know if it's plausible

52:29.180 --> 52:31.820
but I always noticed that if I if i'm

52:32.460 --> 52:35.180
If i'm if I party hard and i've been drinking a lot

52:36.220 --> 52:39.660
If I don't eat before I go into bed if I don't eat shitty food

52:39.900 --> 52:44.300
The next day I will wake up and feel worse than if I eat shitty food. I feel better

52:44.380 --> 52:47.820
I know it sounds crazy. I don't know why but it works for me

52:49.900 --> 52:52.620
Yeah, but it's also hard to do science on extreme performers

52:52.860 --> 52:55.260
So the discussions we're having is amongst the very elite

52:55.820 --> 52:59.900
You know that this might not apply to a general like recreational athlete

53:00.220 --> 53:04.220
But for the elite i've just seen champions in every kind of combat sport

53:04.300 --> 53:09.740
And i've never seen a correlation between dietary habit and performance in people under the age of 30

53:10.380 --> 53:13.580
I do believe that diet is important for longevity. However, and

53:14.620 --> 53:17.820
For that alone that may well be worth investing time in it

53:18.060 --> 53:23.180
But with regards sports performance at least in jiu-jitsu i've never seen any significant difference

53:23.260 --> 53:25.260
Well, we had a little bit of uh

53:25.340 --> 53:29.740
A difference of opinion on this I think uh, what about strength training and muscle building?

53:29.900 --> 53:33.340
Or at least we had a discussion about this. So what do you believe is the value of?

53:35.580 --> 53:39.420
Of you know training outside of the sport so fitness

53:40.300 --> 53:43.740
lifting heavy lifting explosive all kinds of lifting

53:44.540 --> 53:49.020
Do you believe personally for me? I believe and i've learned that from from john

53:49.980 --> 53:52.300
uh, I used to to do like

53:53.100 --> 53:59.260
To train like a bodybuilder before because I thought in my early days of competition that was

53:59.900 --> 54:04.860
The most efficient way to do things to because it was like I was watching jean claude van dam

54:05.500 --> 54:09.740
Arnold schwarzenegger we thought back back in the day. That was the thing

54:10.700 --> 54:14.540
That that's how we should do it, you know for to get ready for a fight

54:15.260 --> 54:16.780
But I realized

54:16.780 --> 54:18.540
later on

54:18.540 --> 54:21.600
Uh that it's all about efficiency

54:22.380 --> 54:27.100
And some guys they don't lift at all and they're doing pretty well. So I

54:27.980 --> 54:29.500
Do cross-training

54:29.500 --> 54:31.500
Mostly for longevity

54:31.740 --> 54:35.100
It's mostly for a therapy like a therapy

54:35.340 --> 54:39.340
It's more therapeutic than for performances to keep my body healthy

54:39.660 --> 54:44.540
To do certain movements that are different than what I do every day in the gym in combat sport

54:45.100 --> 54:47.100
to keep me

54:47.180 --> 54:54.140
Uh healthy and and athletic so all the interesting movement stuff that you've done outside the sport that was for

54:54.780 --> 54:57.820
Therapeutic mostly therapeutic. I think it does it could

54:58.940 --> 55:04.140
Transcend to performance, but it's mostly therapeutic. I do not believe that squatting

55:05.020 --> 55:07.660
Five plates or or bench bench pressing

55:08.220 --> 55:13.980
Three plate will make me a better fighter. I do not I believe actually it could hurt me more

55:14.140 --> 55:17.100
It could damage me more than than benefit me

55:17.900 --> 55:19.260
so

55:19.260 --> 55:25.020
Gordon is somebody who on instagram posts a lot of pictures of you being shredded and huge

55:25.900 --> 55:30.380
What's the value of of strength? So I do like a combination of uh

55:31.420 --> 55:37.580
John got us big into like gymnastics type movements like toes to bar and muscle ups and things like that when we were young

55:38.060 --> 55:43.580
Um like toes to bar because that's like the exact motion you have to do when you're retaining guard is knees to chest

55:44.060 --> 55:46.060
Um, so I do a lot of that stuff

55:46.460 --> 55:48.460
in combination with I do a lot of

55:49.020 --> 55:51.180
Opposite of george. I do a lot of bodybuilding workouts

55:52.380 --> 55:57.180
Where I do like a basic split like a chest and triceps back and biceps day

55:57.900 --> 55:59.900
and my idea is that

56:01.580 --> 56:08.300
Weight lifting should always be a supplement to jiu-jitsu. So you shouldn't be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift weights

56:08.700 --> 56:14.380
Um, so I don't do I do probably I train jiu-jitsu every day and I lift three to four times a week

56:14.620 --> 56:19.260
Um, I feel like lifting seven days a week for me is is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy

56:19.340 --> 56:21.020
When you do like hard lifts like that

56:21.020 --> 56:24.620
Um, but my idea is if you want to get good at jiu-jitsu do jiu-jitsu

56:24.700 --> 56:30.300
and if you want to be bigger and stronger lift weights and uh, and eat food and um

56:31.100 --> 56:36.860
I I generally don't go super heavy when I lift because you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff

56:37.180 --> 56:41.580
um, so I usually do moderate weights with a with a very high rep rep range like four sets of 20 with

56:41.820 --> 56:44.860
A drop set at the end to fatigue the muscles break the fibers and

56:45.660 --> 56:46.860
grow

56:46.860 --> 56:54.060
Okay, so uh four sets of 20. That's interesting. So that's more for endurance and raw strength. Yeah, and also I think

56:54.620 --> 56:57.340
close to the competition i'll pick the intensity up and

56:58.060 --> 57:02.220
While there's no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max

57:02.540 --> 57:06.540
I think that lifting and just getting used to mentally red lining

57:07.100 --> 57:12.460
Um gets me kind of in competition shape because a lot of times in jiu-jitsu the guys i'm training with

57:13.100 --> 57:15.740
They're not on a technical level where they can

57:16.380 --> 57:18.780
Physically exhaust me to the point where I feel like i'm gonna die

57:19.340 --> 57:24.060
But uh, I get most of that like when i'm wrestling because i'm not as efficient in wrestling so I get a lot more tired

57:24.700 --> 57:27.980
And lifting when you do like if you do like four sets of 20

57:28.300 --> 57:32.060
Leg press to squat and you go back and forth like you're like about to die at the end

57:32.300 --> 57:38.540
And I think I feel it gets me in the mental habit of red lining before competition, but does muscle help you?

57:39.100 --> 57:45.660
It's like the actual mass of muscle like this. So I think being stronger will always help and the combat will always help. Yeah

57:46.620 --> 57:49.340
to some degree it's not going to be to a degree where

57:50.380 --> 57:52.380
It overrides efficiency, but I think that

57:53.100 --> 57:59.740
It can't help being or can't hurt being stronger. There's a bunch of people who believe depending on the sport that um

58:00.380 --> 58:03.100
The strength can quickly become uh

58:04.060 --> 58:09.180
That have detrimental effects to efficiency. Yeah, like I agree with that certain kind

58:09.820 --> 58:13.100
I mean if strength is pure is like very cleanly

58:13.580 --> 58:16.140
Purely applied to the exact movements of the sport

58:16.220 --> 58:22.780
So in judo the explosiveness you need is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. Yeah

58:23.260 --> 58:25.260
I mean for us, uh

58:25.580 --> 58:30.220
You always have to understand there's only so much technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength

58:30.300 --> 58:33.580
Like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla, it's going to kill us

58:34.140 --> 58:37.420
Um, but that that being said, um, I do think that

58:37.980 --> 58:45.100
Like for example heavy weights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size and strength to beat smaller people

58:45.420 --> 58:50.460
Um, but I think that if you stay with this with the discipline of doing everything very precise

58:50.620 --> 58:52.860
And I train with a lot smaller people most of the time

58:52.860 --> 58:54.940
So I get out of the habit of using

58:55.420 --> 58:59.100
Uh using my strength. Um, I think if you're very precise at the way that you train

58:59.180 --> 59:05.340
I think that the the extra size and strength can help you quick question. How would you fight a silverback gorilla?

59:07.740 --> 59:13.420
I mean is there which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive that most people would say you can't

59:14.140 --> 59:16.140
You know, I actually

59:16.140 --> 59:18.140
I don't have an uh an answer to this

59:19.020 --> 59:24.060
I want I want I want to say that me and john had like a four-hour discussion on this one time

59:24.540 --> 59:26.860
I'm like what would win bear or gorilla?

59:27.100 --> 59:33.260
And he went with like this whole dissertation about how like jaguar spin underneath and like baron bolo silverbacks and kill them and like rip their

59:33.500 --> 59:39.100
Rip their artery in their legs out. It was amazing. I guess okay. So before we talk about strength john, let me ask you what

59:40.060 --> 59:46.700
Do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced one of them would win and people wouldn't predict that

59:47.180 --> 59:53.580
So they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting in the whether it's in the forest in the jungle

59:53.900 --> 59:55.900
So let's wait slow down here

59:56.860 --> 59:59.100
So there's two animals of different species fighting

59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.980
And and most people would pick

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:08.860
So for example, the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why the king of the jungle

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.860
well, I

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.860
You know a lot of people told me that the lion

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.340
for example the tiger can

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.220
Be a lion. Yeah, this is one of those age-old debates

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:24.780
Yeah, well in grappling in fighting it feels like some animals use teeth

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.020
and some use

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.740
other parts of their body also like a bear actually, I don't even know how they

01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:35.260
I think they have extraordinarily powerful

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:42.300
And long claws and in addition, they're powerful biters as well. So I wonder and the same with the silverback

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.740
I don't know how much they're I love that we're having this discussion

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.260
We need joe rogan for this discussion. I think so. Yeah, I think so

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.980
so

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.140
Your your question is going in in about five different. So it started with strength

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.260
And let's go back there, which is

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:04.140
Do you think for for an athlete in jiu-jitsu? Let's let's stick to grappling

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.460
Do you think strike strength is helpful or detrimental?

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.180
I've always believed that

01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.180
two things will

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.740
create whatever

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:21.340
Whatever effectiveness you have in grappling those are your skill set and your attributes

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.940
And the best athletes are those who excel in both

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:29.580
Don't kid yourself if someone gets twice as strong

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:35.500
By some kind of magic potion, they're going to be a more effective grappler if someone gets

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.620
Twice the level of endurance that they had previously they will be a more effective grappler

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:45.500
these physical attributes have a very important outcome on the

01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:49.260
Sorry a very important effect upon the outcome of matches

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.140
It's always a good thing to be stronger. It's always a good thing to have better endurance

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.620
It's always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:06.380
Gordon's point was okay. Everyone agrees on that, but there's a problem in order to build these things

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:13.820
You have to carve into other elements of your training regimen and then it becomes well which becomes more important

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.860
increases in strength or increases in skill

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.700
There comes a point where

01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:28.240
Investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns. I can't tell the difference between someone who bench presses

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:33.980
300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds, but that's a big difference

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.900
That's a hundred pound difference

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:41.820
And for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds that would require a great deal of

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.460
of training effort and focus

01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:48.220
But if I can't tell the difference when I grapple and then why bother?

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:50.700
Okay, once you get to a certain strength level

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:56.300
It doesn't really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:01.100
That's the stage you're really getting a diminishing in returns on your training investment

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.980
Um now skills on the other hand

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:12.220
Experience far far less in terms of diminishing returns every new skill you develop

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.940
can translate

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:20.140
Very very well into big increases in performance. Look at the example of gary tonen that we talked about earlier

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760
investments in guillotine

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:25.340
made a significant improvement in his

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.660
Effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.820
um

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.540
but if he had invested the same amount of training time and

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:39.180
Developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously that would have had no outcome

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.900
No influence on the outcome of those matches

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:46.460
So the question always becomes yep. Everyone acknowledges that these physical

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:54.540
Attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a desirable thing

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:59.660
And every athlete should work on them the interesting question becomes okay at what point

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:04.540
Do you start to say i'm not going to be helped by further increases?

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:08.220
in in strength training or endurance training

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:15.100
And my point with my athletes is in the overwhelming majority of cases

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.500
If there's any kind of doubt invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training

01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:24.460
Especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.100
Well, the interesting thing that I think you should account for with strength training

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.660
is um

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.660
There's instagram

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.260
There's the world. It's uh, it seems to be more fun

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:39.820
to build muscle mass

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:43.580
It's like an addiction people have there's also economic elements, too

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.620
Like most people I I hate to say this but it's true

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:51.980
most people are more concerned with image than function and

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:53.820
Uh

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.820
It's hard to sell

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:01.580
A fighter or a jiu-jitsu athlete who doesn't look like one looks like fedor

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.900
Yeah, it's a tough sell now

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:09.500
You can do it in fighting and jiu-jitsu because ultimately it's about whose hand is raised at the end of the match

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.420
And you can even use it as a selling point

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.660
You can be a guy that doesn't look like he should be winning but he is winning that is a selling point

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.300
but if you give most people a choice between

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:19.740
Between

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:25.180
Looking like arnold schwarzenegger in winning matches versus looking like fedor and winning matches most people will select

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:30.780
I wish I'd rather look like arnold schwarzenegger. And so most athletes feel almost like an economic

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.280
Compulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:41.260
Yeah, nike's not going to sponsor fedor or tank abbott. Yeah tank abbott

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:42.860
no

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.540
fedor maybe

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.380
But yeah, yeah we need at the very top there's there's something about uh aesthetic

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:55.660
Like image of strength and power. It's also and also a personal thing if you look at yourself in the mirror

01:05:56.140 --> 01:06:00.380
Do you like what what you see? You know what I mean? Yeah, do you find yourself attractive?

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.700
You know, what what can you do to make you look better?

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.060
You know, I think to me to me it was something one of the reasons I work out

01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:11.260
It's also for for that. Well, i'm sure if fedor looks in the mirror. He says I look damn good today

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.460
Yeah, you couldn't be too it's also a genetic factor some people

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.660
You know, it's harder for them. I mean, yeah

01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:23.580
All right. So the question on training you guys john gordon trained

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.620
Often three times a day every day

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.340
Georgia had a different like um

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:38.460
A different approach to training. So like what is uh for for no, I don't mean then a kind of the opposite or something

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.780
It's just not every single day. So

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:43.820
and obviously you are

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.440
Legitimately at the very top

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.820
In terms of performance accomplishment in the field. So what have you learned about?

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:59.260
What it takes to train to become not just the lead but the best well I I um

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:06.940
A lot of people when you say train they they see training hard. I believe you need to be very constant

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:13.660
Uh and uh, very disciplined you need to train but you don't need to train hard every day

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.140
That's what john taught me

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.420
um

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:23.340
For me is the nervous system. Sometimes I feel if I load it up too much it comes to a point that you're

01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:28.300
It's too much. There is no no more information that I can absorb

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.460
so

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.260
uh

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:38.140
And I do believe that it's something that you can train to your the capacity your capacity of being able to learn of absorbing

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:39.660
certain thing

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.140
And uh, I did a lot of volume of training

01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:48.140
But when I when I was getting ready for a fight, especially during sparring day

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.180
I like to do it quick because my when I fight it's five round of five minutes

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:55.820
I don't like to to spend

01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.060
um

01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:01.820
Uh an hour or two hours in a gym because

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.020
I need to know how hard I can be

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:11.580
Going for 25 minutes, you know when I not for two hours for 25 minutes and my last fight

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.700
john and I we we

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.820
we

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.900
We were thinking of how could we?

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.460
Make me more

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.580
uh

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.240
Of a better finisher, you know more opportunist

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:30.560
And then john I remember we we when we were training with gordon jake shill came gary tonen

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.920
my round of grappling were different than if I would be training for uh

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:42.400
Abu dhabi, you know for for abi or like some like in grappling the round or longer but

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.600
In a mixed martial art fight

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.360
It's very rare that you're going to spend more than

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.480
Four minutes or four minutes and a half on the ground. It's it's very unlikely

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.640
I mean it could it can happen but so

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.040
I do you remember we did the round three minutes. We did all the round. I was doing were three minute round

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360
So it gives a different

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.940
Uh rhythm to the training it forced me to be more opportunist

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:14.960
To be more of a finisher because I had only three minutes to to do what I needed to do

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.720
So if I if I see something I need to to go for the kill right away

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.440
I cannot be too overpatient. You know what I mean?

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:27.440
And it it served me well in my last fight and I think it that's a good blueprint to follow

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.440
When you're a mixed martial art fighter, I if I would if

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.880
The result was great and I think

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.960
Maybe I should have done that before it was a great great idea that we had not to do

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.840
Be very careful on doing too much volume

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.040
Yes, try to get out and then try to focus on finishing and getting getting out as I mean

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.680
To build up your foundation. I believe you need a lot of volume

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.060
But when you get ready for competition, you need needs some to be something that replicate

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:03.680
What you're going to be facing? What are we talking about? What do you think?

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.480
Like is there rest days five days a week?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.400
Twice a day once a day. Is there any one formula like that?

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.040
I don't know this this I don't I do not believe in over training. I believe in under rest

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.480
I believe

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120
You can be under rest and

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.440
people

01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:28.800
Always link that immediately to the volume of their how much volume they they train

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:34.960
Which it could be something else. How are you feeling? I'm emotionally are you are you having a

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.720
Problems

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:43.520
Personal problem. Do you have a have a hard time sleeping because you have a like someone died or I don't know like

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.680
You hold money you're broke or what like you know what I mean? It could be anything

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.500
Uh, there's something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.440
That made it in a way that you cannot sleep well because your your stress your cortisol level is high

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.400
Your you know what I mean all these factors need to be take taken in consideration

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.360
It's not only about the volume of training people

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.280
always think

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.840
The volume of the training is the only thing

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.280
That can affect recuperation, which is not

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:22.660
You know, yeah, you have to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of factors. It's a very stressful job to be a professional

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:28.560
Combat athlete whether you're a grappler a boxer kickboxer a fighter

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.040
And you need to be taking

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.160
as

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.000
Into account is it more or less stressful than marriage just kidding

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:39.360
next question

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:46.880
So I don't know how to ask this question given what george just said but you're training three times a day

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:55.760
And finishing and what what have you learned about what what brings out the best in you as as the elite level grappler

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.880
Um, so over the recent years have actually changed it up a little bit. Um when I was

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.720
Coming up through from white to black belt

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:11.120
I felt that the volume was the most important. So it would be anywhere from like three

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
To seven sessions a day

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:15.360
um

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.600
Going from school to school from new york to new jersey

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.680
And I think that the volume was very important to build the skills

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.800
Where I just

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.840
Didn't know how to move my body at purple belt the way that I should so I think that building the skills

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.640
Is uh is super important. I think that early on volume is very important

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.920
Now that I already have the skills built. I think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:42.880
So I find that if I do

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.160
So many sessions a day like if I do three sessions a day

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:53.040
Um, I feel sometimes by the third session. I'm just like so mentally like there's just there's so much information

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:57.520
That's went through my head the first two sessions that I feel like i'm not even there mentally on the third session

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.960
Um, so I feel like doing less volume now

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:07.040
But having more mental clarity per session is more important because I already have the foundational skills acquired

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400
So a lot of your training is almost like

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.080
Just thinking like learning a lot of it. Yeah

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:19.360
So i'll do like I mean our schedule has been messed up since the pandemic because henzel's got shut down

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.720
And they were using a french gym in porto rico and now we're using a french gym in our in in austin

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.440
But once we have our own school have a setup schedule where I can pretty much just be there all day long

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.680
Um, but right now I do like a lifting session in the morning and then i'll come in and help teach

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:40.160
At henzel's so i'm there mentally i'm seeing what's going on and i'm playing around with ideas in my head

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.560
Uh, and then i'm there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:50.080
During the 1 pm session and then after that i'll go home i'll rest and get ready for the next day

01:13:52.800 --> 01:14:00.480
What have you learned on seeing all these different athletes is there a a universal rule that applies or is it um athlete specific?

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:08.000
First one thing that needs to be addressed is that george and gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.880
um gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:19.760
Minutes to literally hours long. Um as a result, uh the overall

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:24.400
Uh pacing and intensity of matches is massively different

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:31.360
Most obviously there is no striking in gordon's sport. Um striking by its very nature is a much more explosive

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.160
Physical action than grappling is grappling is primarily an isometric

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.320
Kind of a sport based around an isometric tension and endurance

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.960
Um george's sport is

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.040
Does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:53.360
The majority of it is based around explosion. So the physical demands of the two sports are radically different

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.400
In addition the time of application is is radically different george raised a very interesting point

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.920
His matches seem long 25 minutes for a championship match

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:06.640
Um, but always understand that

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.920
It makes martial arts fight

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.760
at championship level

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.840
If it goes the distance is really

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.760
Five five minute matches each round

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.680
Is a match in itself and that's exactly how you're scored

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.440
You're scored by who wins the most matches over five matches

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.080
As a result the application of the techniques, especially the grappling techniques has to be done at a certain pace

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.800
as george pointed out realistically

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.840
The maximum application time you're going to get in most situations is somewhere between

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600
15 seconds and three minutes

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.600
Even for a specialized grappler like damien mayer there's still a significant part of each round which is

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.920
Spent in setup time to actually get the match to the ground

01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:00.880
Um, it's very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you'll have to reinitiate the entire process again

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.520
So that even for specialized grapplers you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:10.160
Uh on the ground

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.800
And as a result, you've got to get your work done in a very short time frame

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.880
gordon ryan

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.640
Once it goes to the ground and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:25.120
Uh, we may spend the entire match in ground positions

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.440
Um

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:34.000
As a result the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands and the preparation that the two athletes go through

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.240
Will reflect that uh

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:42.160
If george st pierre in training for mixed martial arts becomes fatigued to a point

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:50.080
Where he's no longer physically effective and able to defend himself the consequences for that in mma training can be very deep and deep

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.360
Okay, if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you're fatigued and tired and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.240
That's some deep consequences

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:05.680
A grappler doesn't have to face that you can be completely exhausted in grappling and just sit in the bottom of the mountain

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:11.440
Just practice just survival skills where you just don't get submitted from bottom out and that can still be an effective training session

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:15.600
complete and utter physical breakdown of fatigue can be

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:24.560
Can end an athlete's career in mixed martial arts the consequences of training through fatigue and mma are

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.440
Potentially very deep and very disturbing

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.080
Um the consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren't really that severe

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.640
Okay, you just tap whenever there's a problem just tap

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.240
Um, and so they're very very different sports in the way you you prepare for them

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.920
um

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.600
In a grappling

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.600
Uh athlete like gordon ryan we can take

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:54.720
Many more liberties with physical exhaustion and the amount of hours a day you spend in training

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.920
Then you could with a mixed martial arts athlete like actually be a benefit

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.320
uh exhaustion as a

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.300
As a framework of learning so like from a place of exhaustion

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.360
Is there any benefit?

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:13.680
Do they you want you said being at the bottom of mouth sort of understanding the jiu-jitsu grappling somehow deeper

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:20.080
Because you're physically absolutely absolutely because then the only thing you have left in your favor is your technique

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.120
And then you'll see how technical you are in addition

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.320
You'll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don't spend a lot of time in

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.560
and you'll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to endure which will

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.800
have uh

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:41.120
Potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. Yeah, there's uh, I mean for me for a recreational person

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.520
getting

01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.640
Exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels like to really get dominated

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:52.320
At an even greater frequency than you otherwise would

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.120
And there's something there. There's some animalistic thing. That's very unpleasant

01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:00.720
and then afterwards it takes you to a nice to a place of

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600
like, um humility and

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.200
I don't know you get it forces you to rethink life

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.680
in positive ways

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.680
There's something about dominance

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:16.800
I mean if you get dominated a few times you can uh, rationalize it somehow

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.280
You say okay. Well, i've screwed this up

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:25.040
But with when you're exhausted and you have to do like 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of just being dominated

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.120
Over and over and over being submitted

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.880
It uh, I don't know. It's it's a very good process for

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.960
For other avenues of life. I find I can't explain why because i'm

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.400
Driving home

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.840
Crying afterwards listening to bruce springsteen, but afterwards

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:46.960
Yeah, this

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:53.280
Afterwards somehow you can think clearer you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:57.040
Like relationships work, but also the grappling

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.480
Actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:05.840
It clarifies other avenues the humility it removes the bullshit

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.600
It's like we see

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.600
The world through some kind of fog and it just removes it and now you can see things clearly. I don't know what that is

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.080
I think I think it's important. Like you mentioned to push yourself like sometimes

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.080
to see

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:26.080
How far you can go because sometimes you you can go further than than what you think and it can boost your confidence

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.560
You know, you can push yourself through a certain limit

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:33.760
And maybe you thought your limit were was before that point and you push through it

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.520
And you push through it

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:36.240
but

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.240
Like john just mentioned

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.240
It's a risky thing to do in

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.480
Striking because if you're exhausted you're going to get brain damage

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.640
In grappling it's you know, you tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.600
I like to run track. I do it all the time and track and fill

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.240
It it helps me to

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.560
To to know myself better. I think it's important. So it's a good point

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.680
And it's like it's like the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do it's like, you know, if you stop moving

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.200
That you're gonna get scored on and you know in your mind like there's no mechanical reason

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.400
Why I am why I should give up a score here, but you're so exhausted that you're like, oh man

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.440
This is terrible. If I if I stop moving i'm a pussy

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.800
If I don't stop move if I don't stop moving i'm gonna be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.760
So it's a it's an interesting game. You have to play inside your mind

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.480
It's it's your pride very often that that

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:33.200
keep you that keep you

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Sharp, you know what I mean? Because you just want to lay down and beat it because you're completely exhausted, you know

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:46.160
What do you think uh is the connection john between this ego pride thing?

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.000
martial arts and actual violence in our

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.560
with our ancestors do you think

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.360
Do you ever plug into that you think there's echoes of something going on there or like you mentioned you have flaws and demons

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.000
Is it deep in there somewhere? Do you think we're struggling with those demons?

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.640
Yeah, uh, you'll need to patch up your question a little bit though. It's going in several different directions. Wow, that was

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:15.920
Not only might be dominating jiu-jitsu. I mean dominating interviewing. No, no, no, i'm not

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.400
that question

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.640
Where they're like, okay now we interview you

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.440
But you you went down the evolution

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:31.360
I mean, do you think do you um, I don't mean just a line between what is what is martial arts and what is violence?

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.680
I mean there there seems to be a gray area

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:41.040
And that connects us to the the evolutionary ancestors. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I I think there's a deep

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.320
recognition in all of us that

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.880
and this is

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:49.040
the evidence for this is is so easy to

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
To see in in daily life

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:59.520
If you're walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:08.080
You will see literally everyone on that street stop whatever they're doing and watch the fight

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.120
Humans

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.800
are fascinated

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:14.400
by violence

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:22.640
And you've got to ask yourself why and of course, it's a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.340
Violence was one of the most important elements in human existence

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.520
As much as we curse it as much as we

01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.240
Talk badly of it. Um

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.960
The juxtaposition between humans social nature and their their need to for each other to get along and to express

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:46.880
Love amongst the the various members of a given community

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.760
there are

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.880
Disputes between humans that can't be resolved and ultimately

01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.720
throughout history violence has been the number one method of

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.600
conflict resolution

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:04.880
um for better or for worse and there's a recognition in all of us that

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.920
This is where we come from

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.920
and there's a reason why

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.320
combat sports have this

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.760
thing where

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:18.880
People will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them, but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.520
and um

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.800
I do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.200
of their

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.520
even if it's on a subconscious level this kind of

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
belief that

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.320
This is who we are. Um george used the word pride and I believe that's a big part of it. I believe that

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:42.960
Um

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:44.800
Most

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.800
Humans have this sense of self-worth and pride which they're willing to fight for

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.240
and uh

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.280
If it gets crossed by someone else they're willing to stand that

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.120
Some people will stand more early and some people will be pushed further back, but everyone's got that line

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.680
Beyond which they won't be pushed

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:06.560
And there's some kind of deep recognition in all of us that we have that somewhere within us

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.600
No matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.720
That's why I believe there will always be this eternal

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.280
interest in combat sports

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.480
Now

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:24.640
I don't believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:27.340
non-consensual violence

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:31.840
um, I think most people most good people are repulsed by that and i'm

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.560
I'm sure that as humanity

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.080
Improves out into the future that will become more and more widespread

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.160
but

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:43.520
That's not to say we we can't exercise these these

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.600
old evolutionary demons inside of us and um, uh, and

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:57.280
sometimes there are just disputes between different people different cultures different nations where ultimately it's going to come to

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.960
Into into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence. There's always going to be

01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.600
a need for humans to be able to

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.680
to uh

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.680
express themselves

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:14.720
Through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their their goals and objectives

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.800
um

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.640
our

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.000
Our need as humans is always to find a balance between

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.020
The two forces of conflict and cooperation

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:32.160
We need cooperation because humans isolated from each other are more or less helpless and useless

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.000
In order to advance human communities need to build and grow

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.280
And so that sense of cooperation occurs in most of our daily lives

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.480
But there will also be irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to to form a resolution

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.960
And so most human beings find themselves

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.500
swinging like a pendulum between conflict and cooperation

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:01.200
and um, uh, and that is something which

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.920
Really gives birth I think to combat sports because sorry

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:12.160
Well, I really have to ask you about this then there's a guy even harvard, uh named richard rangham

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.400
And there's a lot of people that believe this he wrote this book that um

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.920
Basically, there's a lot of people studying is what happened. How do we get from apes to humans?

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.280
Like what was the magic thing? Right? A lot of people attribute it to fire and ability to cook meat

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.920
There's a lot of different theories

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:30.880
so

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.880
he actually, um

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:35.440
His theory

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.920
How do I describe this is basically that that the beta males won

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.200
that the the

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:44.160
the

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.160
Apes that were able to cooperate

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.840
So you the way you develop cooperation is that there's a big bad leader

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.120
that uh, the the alpha male

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.680
That you can only

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.800
Um knock off their throne if you cooperate

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:08.000
And so we built big tribes that just excelled the cooperation by practicing the overthrowing the leader

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:09.360
and so

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.820
And anytime an alpha male would rise up they would get we would we would uh develop our skill further and further of cooperation

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:21.680
And so we're all just beta males, uh the descendants of beta males

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.920
That's his uh kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental and it's so distinct to the the rest of the

01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.540
neighboring animal kingdom

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:35.520
So fascinating. I I wonder what you think about this tension of violence of cooperation

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.560
How important is this cooperation to the core of yeah?

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.920
If you even look at it in the uh in a given training room, um

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.880
jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat

01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:57.360
But all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers and

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.800
Uh as much as it's an individual sport

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.720
All of your preparation is done in as part of a group

01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.280
um

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.920
There's a sense in which

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:16.240
That's an interesting metaphor for humanity itself everything we do in life we do alone, but we grow up in this

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.800
Given community and and what have you?

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.520
Um

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.200
With regards to the the whole alpha male beta male thing, um

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:32.800
Humans are it's true. This fellow's correct. We you know, most

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:40.880
primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
uh of of

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:47.280
The community they they build around themselves

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.520
um

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.520
Humans on the other hand

01:29:51.600 --> 01:30:00.000
Don't have an alpha male in that strict biological sense of someone who's responsible for the next generation dominates all the

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:05.120
Female population, etc. Yeah physically dominates, but we do on the other hand

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:11.120
Have our own version of alpha males in so far as we have political and sociological leaders

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.480
Who have a disproportionate impact on the direction of a community?

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.400
um

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.440
uh

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.600
so was the cooperation allowed us to

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:29.760
To have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top. Yeah. Yeah

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.320
Now that's a fascinating theory

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:40.400
Okay in nature we're we're very weak as a species so we needed to cooperate cooperate in order to

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.120
to evolve that I think

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.400
Made us uh that the top of the food check if you look at um

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:51.900
Humanity in in nature

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.560
Really the two things that seem to

01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:00.880
More than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:05.460
Successful in a predatory world are numbers and technology

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:12.800
Okay, the more your numbers increase and the the higher the technology of the weapons and support systems you have around you

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.040
The more successful you'll be in a predatory world

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:23.520
So it's not clear that just killing off the idea of an alpha male was the the the single biggest thing

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.040
um

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040
the rise of technology

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.040
And the growth of community

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:32.400
After the imposition of language. These are other things that would have been

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.800
Very very important factors and and humanity's rise george. You made an interesting point if you look at humans

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.640
Just the raw material of humans we're we're we're fucking pathetic

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.320
And a predatory animal kingdom, we're just the absolute bottom of the food chain

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.880
Um, we don't have a single

01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.800
effective

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:56.080
Weapon other than better than average endurance. That's about it

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.680
But you put us in a community

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.720
Who can talk to each other with language and give us the time?

01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:07.440
To come up with technological advances such as metals

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.080
Um, and suddenly a human

01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.520
will go from

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:18.480
No combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom to a human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:23.520
Damn near any animal in the uh in the animal kingdom and working as a group

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:26.400
I'll beat your silver back, you know, wow

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:32.160
I'll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim so I don't have to touch him

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.280
You'll drown and I'll get him into the pool

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:40.240
You know why because someone told me because I live in a community someone told me that information

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.800
So I know he passed it on to me. Yeah

01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.800
He taught you

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:49.680
Well, you have to convince him to you have to somehow convince them to join you in the pool, which is very difficult

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.760
It's a very problem. Very very difficult. Um

01:32:55.440 --> 01:32:59.200
From a technical perspective john you've looked at

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.880
Mixed martial arts fighting in general and grappling. What's the difference between fighting and grappling?

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.520
That's something i'd love to

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:13.940
Ask all of you. Maybe john you can start like, um, well, uh, when you talk about fighting you mean unrestricted

01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:19.760
Mma type fighting. Yeah, it's funny. You said unrestricted mma type fight

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:24.080
Mma type fighting so there's there's the street fighting. Yep. Yep

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.520
There's mma fighting and then there's grappling but purely the sport of grappling you're saying

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:36.720
Okay, what's the difference between mma and grappling? Yes. Okay. Um, see that would have been a much better question to ask. Um, well the uh,

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.040
the single

01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:41.280
When you talk about grappling you're talking about jiu-jitsu rules

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:48.640
Yeah, I mean you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally challenge that change the sport, you know

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:52.080
um in the sport of mixed martial arts, uh

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.040
You've got two

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:01.120
Ways to inflict damage on the human body you've you've got kinetic energy which is done through striking

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.920
kicking knees elbows fists

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.640
And you've got

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.240
uh isometric tension used along the lines of

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.880
lever and fulcrum

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.760
Which can be used for strangulation and joint breaking

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:17.680
Um

01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:22.320
In grappling you lose one of those you you're no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:25.280
You can do it accidentally through a throw, but you're not allowed to just

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.880
You know knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.200
It can happen, but it's relatively rare and it's it's not encouraged by the rule set

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840
so, um

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600
Yeah, you got close, um

01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.160
So

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:49.120
There's a sense in which in mixed martial arts you got twice as many problems to deal with and um, uh, and they occur

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.200
in

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:57.440
A much shorter time frame the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.120
In human combat versus striking technique is time

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.040
Grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.640
Okay, the great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome once you get there

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:15.280
It takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.160
physically take them down

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:24.880
Work their way work your way towards a dominant position culminating in your opponent's back and then apply a strangle hold

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.480
that's a long chain of events as opposed to

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.960
A strong punch or kick which can take quarter of a second then application from start to finish and the match is over

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.200
um

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.320
and so

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:42.400
There's a sense in which

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.120
Grappling is is it's

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.520
It's fighting for the patient and the calculating

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.280
Whereas striking is much more for

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:59.120
In this short time frame where everything gets done and the in the blink of an eye

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:05.360
There's a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. You can make a terrible mistake

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:09.520
End up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win

01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.680
In mixed martial arts, it's much much less forgiving

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:19.760
If you get hit and stunned your chances of recovery

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.640
Are minimal you're going to get swarmed on and unless it's right at the end of the round you

01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:28.640
It's very very hard to recover from getting hit and swarmed on

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.960
So there's a sense in which

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:35.920
The biggest difference between them is time of application of technique

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.040
Uh in mixed martial arts, it's incredibly unforgiving in terms of time

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.260
Even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences

01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.320
In grappling you can make massive errors and still come back and win

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.840
um

01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.840
Grappling will typically be won

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:57.840
In a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320
whereas there is

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:03.040
Much more of what they call a punch's chance

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.680
in mixed martial arts where

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.200
There's a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete

01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:15.920
Defeating a greater athlete in mma than there is in grappling simply because of time of application of the techniques

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:21.120
Even the smallest period of inattention in mma and the match is over

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.840
Gordon ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.440
Have his opponent mounted on and wake up and finish him five minutes later. That's not going to happen in mma

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.200
Okay, so the the stakes are much higher

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.160
You can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time and just the dynamo the temporal dynamics of how things happen

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.080
Is very different everything you'll see will be a reflection of that then you go further into things like rule sets

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.360
In the sport of grappling if gordon ryan comes out and sits down in the middle of the mat

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.520
His opponent must follow him to the ground and engage

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.400
in mixed martial arts

01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:58.480
If you come to the center of the cage and sit down

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600
The other guy can just walk away from you

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.120
They're completely

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:06.080
Oriented in different directions grappling is ground centered

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:11.280
Mma is typically standing centered at the beginning of every round you have to start standing again

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:17.520
If I disengage from a ground grappling situation stand up and walk away from my opponent

01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:19.840
My opponent must follow me up to the feet

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.760
In grappling it's the exact opposite if I sit to the ground my opponent must follow me to the ground

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:31.520
It's written into the rule set and so one is inherently ground oriented and one is inherently standing oriented

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.840
So it's more it's more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:40.960
Yes, you have to be able to impose where the fight is whereas in grappling you can simply choose it

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.960
So george, what is uh your sense of the the difference in terms of how you approached it?

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:54.960
Between the two sports so you also are a student of wrestling and grappling so in preparing for fights

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:00.880
What parts of grappling purely the sport that you have to leave behind

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.760
Well, I I

01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:08.720
I'm very lucky. I had the opportunity to I train with I consider the best

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360
mentor trainer I ever ever had

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.840
and I have

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:19.600
Some of the best grapplers that I can train with they were they were there to help me through my career

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.000
so

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
uh for my training is

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.480
Of course because I do not dedicate as much time in one specific area. It's hard to be

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:36.560
You know a world-class athlete and that in in only one particular area always

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.960
for me

01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:45.920
Like the idea to be more well rounded to be very competent in every of those areas striking grappling

01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.720
take downs and and all those areas then being just

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.520
very good at one

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.720
and not as good at as as others, you know, because I like the idea that

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.680
It gives me more option when I fight someone I can

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:10.640
Mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to a that person better if i'm more well rounded

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:13.920
If I do not have those well rounded skill

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.440
And I don't have that option, you know

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.960
You have less tools to work with less technology. What about you gordon? What? Um,

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.160
Um

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:29.120
You know, what do you think is very distinct about grappling in the way you approach it versus fighting?

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.640
I think most of it was covered but I think that though the one one of the big things is the fact that

01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.880
When you're looking at mma

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:43.120
You have a pretty general agreed upon and unified rule set where if you look at ufc versus bellator

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.080
They're they have slight differences in the rules maybe um, but it's pretty much the same thing

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:54.400
Whereas in grappling you have ebi rules then you have adcc rules. You have ibjjf rules. You have no time limit rules

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.080
and

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:02.640
Each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes. Um, if you have if you do adcc rules

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.520
It generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers or if they can stall to the overtime

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.040
And then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really doing jiu-jitsu, but they score a takedown

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.160
They're going to win

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:16.160
Whereas if you have like an ebi for example

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:22.720
You have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu-jitsu position with your back taken or in an armbar

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:25.360
so I think that you have

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:31.360
certain rule sets that play in the favor of certain athletes, um, and

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:36.400
Certain athletes can win in one rule set but then they just have no chance of winning in the other

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.880
Like when I fought yuri the first time in ebi

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:44.640
I beat him in ebi the chances of me beating him on that night under an adcc rule set were probably pretty low

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.520
Um when I fought leandre low under an adcc rule set he beat me that day

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.000
But the chances of him beating me on the same day in an ebi rule set were like next to zero. Um,

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.720
So I think it's interesting that

01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.560
In in mma you have one unified rule set which have small differences, but they're all generally the same

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.600
And in jiu-jitsu you have a wide variety of different rule sets that um have

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:14.000
Uh biases towards a certain athlete skill sets you mentioned leandre low

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.280
I gotta ask you again about adcc

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:21.920
You have lost very very few times in your career

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:29.520
Uh one and I mean this is the same is true for george and uh, the only person who has ever submitted you is felipe

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:31.920
Peña at black belt. Yeah at black belt

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.560
Um, he is adcc world champion multiple time abjjf gyanogi world champion

01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:42.480
You may face him adcc or elsewhere in the future

01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.600
Will you beat him?

01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.520
Uh, yes, I mean I have to say yes, right? Um, but uh,

01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:56.980
I fought him initially when I first got my black belt, um that I fought him a year later. So 2016 and 2017

01:42:57.380 --> 01:42:59.860
Um, and despite what people remember about the match

01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:03.140
And whenever people talk about it's like, oh, yeah the guy who strangled gordon

01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:06.660
But no one remembers that the first match was like a 45 minute war

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:12.580
And then the second match with the full 20 minutes of adcc and if I didn't get my back taken in like the last

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:17.860
Minute and a half two minutes. It would have went into an overtime. Um, that could change the outcome of the match

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:20.260
um

01:43:20.260 --> 01:43:26.820
I think that if you look at felipe's performances, especially nogi specifically nogi since then

01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:30.820
It looks like he's almost gotten worse. Whereas since that match

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.300
uh in 2017

01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:39.220
Uh, the only match I lost after that was against vinny. Uh magalesh by by points and uh,

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.660
I'm on like a 55 match win streak

01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:51.380
Over the course of four years, um winning all the major tournaments nogi and uh felipe since that match I think is like five and two

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.380
nogi

01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:59.300
And he's lost his last two match matches one was convincingly where he was dominated by andre and one was by submission

01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:03.060
Um, so I don't think that he's progressed nearly as fast

01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:08.420
If anything, he looks like he's worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances

01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:13.620
Um, that being said, I know he's going to come in training very hard for this one and he's going to be prepared

01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:15.700
But I just don't think

01:44:16.020 --> 01:44:22.660
That in terms of technical ability he's anywhere near my level and um, he was much bigger than me

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:28.420
Both times we fought. Um the first time he was much bigger than me the second time. He was one way class above me

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:30.900
um, so now there's not going to be an advantage in

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:36.520
Technicality and there's also not going to be a physicality advantage. So I think he's just going to be beat everywhere

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:43.940
This is uh, this is a good example of the scientific response to a um

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.500
To a comment to a question. Yeah, so he's not um

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.500
Um

01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:54.340
That that's a match you're you're not deeply concerned with

01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:57.140
in terms of the set of opponents because

01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:00.500
You have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult

01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.860
Difficult that's actually in my opinion one of the easier matches because of the fact that we're relatively the same size

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:10.180
um if I show up at 230 pounds like a lot of the guys are

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.260
260 270 plus so that extra weight doesn't make a difference. I think out of that entire bracket

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.460
Um

01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.380
Felipe is probably going to be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that I can easily take him down

01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:23.780
And if I take him down i'm going to pass his guard

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:28.580
Whereas I feel like the other guys because they're so much bigger and they're very cagey

01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.180
Um, it may take me a while to actually take them to the ground

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:38.100
And get on top of them and I think it may be they may be longer drawn out matches because of the fact that they're so

01:45:38.100 --> 01:45:40.420
Much bigger and stally it's hard to take them down

01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.340
But Felipe is relatively my size and his wrestling is atrocious

01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:47.220
So and i've already taken him down in the last adcc match

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:51.060
So i'm pretty sure I can just easily put him down pass them and then finish him

01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:57.240
Well, i'm not sure what response I was expecting but uh, that was that was that was phrased beautifully

01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:00.100
um

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:06.340
We talked about the tiago alves fight that george had and john borrowed up in class yesterday

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.700
I believe but the point is we're talking about wrestling and I think that that's a fascinating fight

01:46:12.340 --> 01:46:13.940
that um

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:16.980
There's an incredible display of strategy of skill of heart

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:23.300
Uh george, could you maybe talk about that fight john? Maybe two what lessons you gained from that fight?

01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.580
Go ahead. It was your fight not mine

01:46:28.100 --> 01:46:34.260
Well, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury I think third round. Oh, yeah. Um

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:38.740
So I was fighting tiago alves and uh in the third round I um

01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:42.340
Tear my adductor muscle

01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:47.460
Um it happened when I was on the bottom and he I think he pushed my knee down tried to pass my guard and I

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.300
Heard a pop

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:51.300
I don't know what I think you're going for an armbar

01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:52.900
You were on his back

01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:58.820
You switched to armbar and he cleared the leg by pushing on your leg and you went in with a pre-existing injury and it tore

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:05.060
Yes, and and it it get worse and and I heard a pop I don't know what it was

01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:08.420
but I know it really hurt so I came back standing up and

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:10.580
there's a

01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:16.820
Famous video one that goes on the internet about when I go back in the corner and I tell my my coach

01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:21.060
I'm like, I don't know what it is. I think I tore my my my adductor muscle and

01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:24.900
Greg jackson is like I don't care hit him with your growing

01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.300
I

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:32.420
Was very worried because I wasn't paying but I didn't know I did not know what what I had

01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:37.540
So I didn't know the gravity of it and it it plays on your mind

01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:41.540
So but I had to buy to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight

01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:47.220
You know, I knew I was ahead on the on the scorecard and uh, I needed to finish finish strong

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:51.540
So what was your strategy there in terms of strikes in terms of wrestling? So he's

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:54.100
Exceptionally difficult opponent to take down

01:47:54.420 --> 01:48:00.900
Yeah, well at first I I knew I would add a good jab a good, you know to stay always

01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:07.060
From the outside, you know fight him from the outside and use my footwork because he was like a tank

01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:10.660
he was much bigger and much stronger than me and

01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:14.180
I didn't want never wanted to stay in front of him

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:19.220
So he was all the way out or all the way in and when I was coming all the way in it was with my

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.760
proactive or reactive takedown

01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:23.540
where I

01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:26.180
myself initiated the takedown by

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:33.060
using a distraction like a jab to make his his end goes up and then I go with a

01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:35.300
single or double leg

01:48:35.300 --> 01:48:39.940
or uh to react like baiting him for him to come hit me and then

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:43.460
while he's coming to hit me I go change level and

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:50.020
That's the way I like to take my opponent down, you know some guys for example like like kabib for example

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:52.260
He's very good at at

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:58.180
Bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to to take his opponent down. I find it for me for myself

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.500
I specialize more into

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:03.620
Explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because I found it

01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:06.340
more economical for me

01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:11.220
What what did you see you were you're commenting john about the wrestling

01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:14.020
That was that was quite interesting

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:19.300
I mean also can you generally comment on the fact that george san pierre who don't I don't think you wrestled

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.380
I wrestle I started wrestling. I was 19 years old, but I wrestled some very good russian guys

01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:28.020
so they took me underneath their wing and but

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.140
My ability to cover distance

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:38.420
Come from karate does not come from wrestling wrestling is how I finish once I got the leg how I finish the takedown

01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.140
So the the timing and the movement and the explosion required for this crowd. Yeah

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:48.580
I think an important distinction to make here is um one which

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.260
george

01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:52.260
uh made throughout his career and I

01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.620
Believe george you were the greatest innovator in mma history

01:49:56.020 --> 01:49:58.020
um with regards to this

01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.740
and this is uh

01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:08.100
The creation of what george calls shoot boxing which is the amalgamation of striking technique in george's case

01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:10.820
Mostly karate because that was his martial arts background

01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:15.220
um into grappling and in particular takedowns

01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:17.700
uh

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:19.780
When most people say

01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:23.540
So-and-so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:30.820
You have to be very careful what they mean by this there are many highly credentialed wrestlers

01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:36.340
In the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and truly struggled to have a takedown

01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:42.740
Now these are very very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent

01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:44.660
but

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:52.340
In a striking situation where the ranges are completely different and the setups are entirely different the stances are different

01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:57.700
Even the the overall conditions are different. You're no longer wearing shoes people

01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:01.940
Underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:05.540
You lose like 20 of your forward drive the minute you take off the shoes

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:07.300
um

01:51:07.300 --> 01:51:10.980
uh all of these make massive differences in

01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:15.060
Whether or not you're going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown

01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:22.020
As george pointed out the true value of wrestling in mma is finishing the takedown

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:28.660
Once you've established contact, but that's only about 20 of the action of a of a mixed martial arts takedown

01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:32.820
80 of it is an understanding range rhythm set up

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:36.260
opportunity, etc, etc and

01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.380
And

01:51:37.380 --> 01:51:39.380
That's not part of wrestling at all

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:42.820
Even the overall conditions are completely different in the sport of wrestling

01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:47.780
You start at very close range in a very bent over stance and you're expected to wrestle for

01:51:48.260 --> 01:51:50.500
In international styles for three minutes at a time

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:54.260
Um now suddenly you're completely upright

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:56.420
uh

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.860
and

01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:02.340
You're not wearing shoes all the conditions the the the rhythm and speed of it is different

01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:04.820
The counters are completely different

01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.300
It's just an entirely different animal

01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:10.420
And so george was an early recognizer of this

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:15.780
And started to put the emphasis on direct training for shoot boxing

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:22.580
In addition to wrestling so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the montreal wrestling club

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:30.580
Just the sport of wrestling and that's what made him very good at finishing takedowns, but it was in his shoot boxing training

01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:38.500
Which he himself largely developed remember george started at a time when mma was pretty damn young

01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:40.980
and um

01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:46.500
He we were when when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts george. It wasn't even allowed on tv

01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:50.980
Like it was completely banned. It was in his country. It was physically banned

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:56.660
Uh, they had to fight on indian reservations and you know, and this is way back in the wild west days of mma

01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:00.180
And so as a as a young developing athlete he had to

01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:07.220
More or less do this by himself if you ever want to hear some incredible stories talk about teenage george st

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:08.340
pierre

01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:12.260
Had a coach who used to make him put on boxing gloves now

01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:19.140
He was 16 17 years old and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.940
Late 20s at the peak of his career

01:53:22.020 --> 01:53:26.740
And he said george you're not allowed to punch you just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out

01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:31.620
and there was and it was crazy darwinism he was like

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.340
It's like you're gonna you're gonna

01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:36.660
Adapt or you're gonna die

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.340
Literally, and he could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great

01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:45.620
His methods, but there's a sense here in which people think oh, you know

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:49.860
What determines your takedown ability in mma is your wrestling skill?

01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:51.780
that

01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:58.260
Your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns, but there's so much more to it than that

01:53:58.980 --> 01:53:59.860
um

01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:02.740
Whenever people say, you know, what what are the broad?

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:07.220
Elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight

01:54:07.860 --> 01:54:11.460
Okay on the broadest possible level. I always give the same three things

01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:15.460
The athlete who can dominate the pace

01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:17.860
of the match

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:23.460
The athlete who can dominate the direction of the match and the athlete who can dominate the setups

01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:28.020
Will win the vast majority of fights they're in those three things

01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:32.580
The direction the pace and the setups you dominate all three of those

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.260
You're going to win 90 of the matches you're in

01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:42.500
Um george could always dominate the direction of the fight because he could stop the other guy taking him down

01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:49.300
And he could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match so whether it went to ground or whether it stayed standing

01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.620
Was always up to him

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:55.380
george had the most sophisticated array of setups into takedowns

01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:04.820
That i've personally ever witnessed. Um the whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in george's career

01:55:05.220 --> 01:55:09.620
And he excelled in both most people tend to favor one or the other

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:12.980
Most athletes have a very hard time

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:15.780
imposing

01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:18.500
Their setups on an opponent and as a result they have to use

01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:25.780
The cage as a crutch for their for their setups where they just bully someone towards the cage and then put them down on the cage

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:30.580
George is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:34.360
And could do so in both proactive and reactive situations

01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.160
Um

01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:40.200
And the scary thing is that as good as

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.980
All of you saw him look in the octagon

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:47.160
Anyone who knows george

01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.120
As a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that

01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:56.200
In the gym where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself. I could sit here all day

01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:00.360
I won't name names, but I always laugh and people say oh, this is the greatest

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.120
Uh pound for pound guy of all time and i've personally seen george

01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:06.920
Take that guy down and crush him in the gym

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:10.840
And I can't say anything because it's rude to talk about that in public because it's it's just training

01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:15.800
But i've seen george go with people all the way up to light heavyweight some of the greatest names in the history of the sport

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:17.880
put them down

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:24.360
Advanced position on the ground and dominate them in training. It's it's what he did during that time. I uh george I

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.920
I gotta say I deeply admire

01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:32.280
Many of the things I saw you do not just in the octagon but in training as well as um

01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:35.800
the the impact that you had on

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:37.800
uh

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.680
the

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:40.680
the degree to which

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:44.200
Takedowns were we used in sport was absolutely inspirational

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.400
That's why one of one of the reasons why I always say you're one of the only athlete I ever met who taught me

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:56.520
More than than I taught you because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of of shootboxing and how

01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:01.880
I grew up in a time when uh you I was laughing before when you talked about sugar ray lennard

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:08.040
I was a kid watching that match and um, I grew up in a time where there was boxing and there was kickboxing

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:11.240
and then I came to america and I learned grappling and

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.240
This young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two

01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:19.900
Well, then I have to ask because george sits here uncomfortably being complimented

01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:23.880
If george st. Pierre

01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:27.960
And kabib namaga madhav face each other in their prime who wins

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:33.720
That's a very very loaded question how yeah, like what are the different trajectories you see?

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:41.000
Okay, how does each one win in your view if one wins or the other one wins? What happened interestingly? They're actually

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:43.720
very similar in size despite the fact that

01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:47.240
george fought at welterweight and kabib fought at

01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:53.400
Lightweight if you actually see them stand next to each other the of similar height kabib's is actually a little more thick set

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:56.840
Yeah, he's actually heavier than you're walking around

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:01.820
um george walked around most of his career between 188 and 191

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.120
pounds

01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:06.680
and so kabib actually would ironically have

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:09.320
A kind of size and strength advantage

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:14.280
Despite being in the lighter weight division. That's been the general trend as mma

01:58:14.840 --> 01:58:19.560
Has grown is that athletes will come further down in weight to make weight divisions?

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:23.160
Uh

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.240
I believe that george has the best takedowns in history

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.960
Uh in the open in the cage

01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:34.440
Um kabib was his great strength was using the fence

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
to facilitate takedowns

01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:38.760
um

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760
joe uh kabib's

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.280
Other great strength was not only his ability to take people down but to keep people down for extended periods of time

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.840
both of them were

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.400
Powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:57.560
On the floor, so they're both very similar in that regard

01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:04.120
Um kabib was mostly a uh a puncher from the back george is mostly an elbow from the front

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.400
But both of them could lay waste to opponents

01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.800
With strikes on the floor

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:17.560
Um both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground that they weren't submission specialists in the sense of someone like gordon ryan, but

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:20.040
Uh, they were

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:22.040
certainly, um

01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.120
No slouches with submission holds

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.200
um

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:32.680
Yeah, it's just a fascinating idea. So it's almost like who gets the first takedown. Yeah, I do believe

01:59:33.240 --> 01:59:34.280
that

01:59:34.280 --> 01:59:36.360
They could probably stand up on each other

01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.920
I don't think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.320
Um, both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:49.960
So I don't think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. I don't think it's like that

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.400
um

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:56.920
I do believe that george would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management

01:59:57.480 --> 01:59:58.360
um

01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:01.000
the few times that kabib did look shaky is

02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:03.320
when he

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:09.000
Kabib was either advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to to fight moving backwards

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:13.160
There was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.000
Which is very good and his ability to fight going backwards, which was noticeably

02:00:17.640 --> 02:00:18.680
weaker

02:00:18.680 --> 02:00:24.360
Um george would often fight both forwards and backwards with the geago elvis fight

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:28.680
Most of the standing time. Yeah was was going backwards

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:31.800
That's

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:37.320
Probably the the single biggest difference between the two athletes and skill level would be in the standing position

02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:39.880
um on the ground

02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.720
uh

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:47.000
Kabib slight edge and takedowns on the fence george slight edge and takedowns in the center

02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:54.200
Ability to inflict damage on the floor roughly equal ability to fight off the back roughly equal

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:59.320
Ability to stand up from bottom roughly equal. It's a very very hard match. Um

02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:05.000
In terms of the the biggest difference in skill level is going to be in a standing position

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:11.000
And so it would come down to um, that doesn't necessarily mean that kabib would lose in the standing position

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.920
He might just push it to the fence and just use match tactics where he

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.160
Kept the fight on the fence for significant periods of time

02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.600
Um, uh, and you can win rounds in that fashion

02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:28.280
So it's a match that could go either way both of them are absolutely the best that you'll ever see

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:33.080
I've always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists i've ever seen in my life were george st

02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:35.480
pierre kabib neiman maguerov and john jones

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:39.960
The three of them have some interesting similarities and differences

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.520
all three

02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:45.640
Uh beat every single person they ever faced

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.000
um

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.760
I I know john jones officially has a loss by dq, but no one believes that was a loss

02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:56.680
um, uh george does have two losses, but he

02:01:57.320 --> 02:01:58.280
uh

02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:00.280
Defeated both athletes decisively

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:03.720
In rematches kabib did it by having no losses

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:11.560
Interestingly all three athletes have at least one match which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost

02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.160
um

02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:18.920
John jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judge's score card kabib's

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:22.520
Uh match against glaeson tbal could have gone either way

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:26.520
Uh george's match with hendrix was could have gone either way

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:33.000
They all had matches that they won which people would dispute the outcome. So that was a similarity between the three of them

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:34.760
um

02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:36.760
all three of them

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.880
Have had the ability

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:45.160
To dominate the direction of fights when they want it to go down it goes down when they don't want it to go down

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.520
It doesn't

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:47.640
um

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:50.120
That's why I put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.960
Mixed martial arts champion must be able to determine the direction of the fights the single most important attribute

02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.520
That they all must have

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.560
As to which of the three is the best it's going to come down to criteria

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:06.680
You you can't pull them apart the

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:13.160
Which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use

02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:15.800
Okay, is it being undefeated?

02:03:15.880 --> 02:03:16.680
um

02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:22.600
Uh, is it the amount of time was it the quality of the opponents that they had if you do it by quality of opponents?

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.800
I think you probably have to give it to george if you do it by

02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.240
um

02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:31.080
Uh measured dominance through not being defeated and it has to go to compete

02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:33.000
um

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.720
Arguably you could say the same with john jones since his one

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:38.120
losses

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.800
uh

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:45.960
By dq but then you could also say the last three or four fights that john's had haven't been the same measure of dominance

02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.960
As we saw previously

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.240
so ultimately

02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:51.240
You've got those three guys in my opinion

02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:57.720
And which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about

02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:01.320
The respective level of the athletes you could throw a blanket over them

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:04.280
The three of them are just that good and um

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:11.800
And which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes

02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:16.760
I believe the best fighter the goat is not even born

02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.880
Because the generation

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:22.840
That is present

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:24.920
Benefit of a huge advantage

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:29.000
They have knowledge technology that we didn't have before

02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:33.960
And we had the the knowledge that the other generation did not have before

02:04:35.320 --> 02:04:36.600
but

02:04:36.600 --> 02:04:41.880
I believe the best the goat is not even born yet as good as they are today. I think you

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:46.280
In sport where you can measure the performance, uh track and field

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:49.240
Olympic lifting you can you know someone

02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:54.520
Is better than the other one because you can measure the performance fighting. It's all subjective

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.040
we always debate of who would win but

02:04:59.080 --> 02:05:01.080
10 the tendency in sport

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:03.880
Is that the performance get better?

02:05:03.960 --> 02:05:09.400
I don't think it's because the athlete necessarily get better. It's because they have access to better technology knowledge

02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:12.300
And they learn from their predecessor

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:15.880
As long as that knowledge is transferred forward

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:23.080
Something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and it's forgotten some of the greatest warriors

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:28.360
I can imagine the kind of grapplers. We just the history didn't record them

02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.100
There there could have been small tribes where they developed many ufcs

02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:38.140
And they've developed the kind of things we you have to think of like, uh, the gracies

02:05:38.680 --> 02:05:41.640
Just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:49.000
I often has this this discussion with john and I think it's very important like to mention it. I ask you very

02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:52.680
several times like what would happen if we would take

02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:59.080
A fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancreas. This is an interesting question

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:05.000
And you you brought some incredible good point and and people don't don't realize it, you know, yeah

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:11.800
no, I think um, one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:17.000
uh the historical records of pancreas like most of what we know was

02:06:17.480 --> 02:06:22.140
Uh from what i'm told is actually lost in the fires of the library of alexandria

02:06:22.840 --> 02:06:27.480
And we're left with only a pitiful amount of information on uh pancreas and matches

02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:32.760
But what we do know is that there was a very large

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.800
participation in the sport and that it was

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:38.440
Widely considered the most popular

02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:45.400
Sport in the ancient olympics and that it was represented in the ancient olympics for many hundreds of years

02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:49.560
Plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient olympics

02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:52.440
And so the development time

02:06:52.760 --> 02:06:55.560
That it may have had would have been very significant it

02:06:56.920 --> 02:07:02.920
Uh as far as we know most of the development would have been in the major greek city states for

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:06.140
Uh literally hundreds of years of development

02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:13.320
Given its prestige as an olympic sport then the best athletes would have been doing it some of the sharpest minds

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:20.440
That we know of in human history were involved in the sport. Um, plato the great philosopher

02:07:21.480 --> 02:07:22.920
uh

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:28.120
Was a pancreasianist in his youth. In fact his name plato is a nickname

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.920
Plata's is like plate

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:35.240
it means broad or big guy like the big guy and um

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:40.280
Uh, he spoke often about pancreasian and his written works

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.600
Um imagine people with the intelligence of plato

02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.720
thinking about

02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:52.280
Grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular olympic sport of that time

02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:55.240
significant numbers of people with

02:07:55.480 --> 02:08:01.400
Financial backing as city states put great prestige upon olympic success. They would have funneled athletes in

02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:09.960
Boarding the best coaches and they had that for many hundreds of years like it's quite conceivable that the best pancreasian athletes were

02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:15.720
of the absolute first quality and um, uh, it it's

02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:20.120
it's so sad to think we'll never know what was their skill level and uh,

02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.120
it's interesting to think about what kind of techniques they had developed whether

02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.240
There's stuff we haven't discovered yet in class. You're talking about the most effective

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:32.440
Take down strategy in wrestling and collegiate wrestling

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:39.560
So maybe let me ask first because we offline talked about this too. What is the highest percentage submission in grappling?

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.200
Overall, you have to go with the rear naked strangle strangles from the back

02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:47.880
If you look at most tournaments and most rule sets

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.840
It has success across all rule sets

02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:53.640
All weight divisions

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:59.880
All body types it doesn't require any kind of specific physical advantage such as height

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:02.760
In order to be effective

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:05.740
Um, it works equally well in both fighting and grappling

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:07.500
Um

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:11.820
It will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is

02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:17.180
Okay, a heel hook is a very high percentage technique in in modern day competition

02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:23.820
But if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he's just not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage

02:09:24.460 --> 02:09:26.700
It won't result in the end of a match

02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:29.100
a stranglehold by

02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:33.100
Contrast will always end a match regardless of your opponent's mental toughness

02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:34.620
so

02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:39.420
Um, I believe it's fair to say that at the end of the day the single most high percentage

02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:45.340
Method of uh submitting people and in grappling is a renegade strength. So when you look at an athlete

02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:47.340
Maybe gordon you can speak to this like what?

02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:51.120
What's the best? Uh, you mentioned gary with the guillotine

02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:55.740
What's the best submission to really invest in is it the rear naked choke?

02:09:56.460 --> 02:10:01.100
To really invest your development like understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that

02:10:01.580 --> 02:10:03.820
Uh, I think that I mean you have to do them all obviously

02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:08.300
But if I had like one submission that I would only one submission I could pick for the rest of my life

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:10.300
It would definitely be a rear naked

02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:15.660
Can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that's the case?

02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:19.820
well as john spoke about they're different in joint locks, whereas

02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:26.620
You don't have to tap you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangle. There's there's no uh

02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:30.140
There's none of that. Um, and then it's just an inherent

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:33.260
Advantage you have being behind someone

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:37.660
Um, whereas if you go for an armbar you stop you start from top mount and you're facing the guy

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:41.580
And then you put them down and you're not not directly behind them with leg locks. You're facing the guy

02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:46.460
Whereas when you're on someone's back you have them in a pin where you can your chest to back

02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:49.980
You have a body triangle and you're pinning the guy in place. He can't explode out

02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:51.980
He can't grease his way out most of the time

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:59.100
And there's an inherent advantage you have being behind them due to the fact that we're poorly set up to deal with threats behind us

02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:04.620
So would you say that's the most dominant position jiu-jitsu like more than mount

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.020
More than yeah

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.260
Sat control more than I think uh, if you look at most matches historically

02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:16.300
Most guys who get stuck in positions for long amounts of time are guys that they're back taken

02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.380
um if you get

02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:23.740
An explosive guy from bottom mount he can bridge and he can off balance you and lock half guard maybe and then work back to guard

02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:29.020
But if someone locks a body triangle on your back, um, that's where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long

02:11:29.100 --> 02:11:31.100
amounts of time

02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:34.700
Was uh, was the body triangle like a well understood thing?

02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:40.780
Was that an invention at some point like as a system as a as a control?

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.820
Perhaps some of your your listeners can correct me on this

02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:47.660
But I believe there was a technique banned in judo called doujime

02:11:48.220 --> 02:11:54.700
Which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back and it was banned in judo

02:11:55.180 --> 02:11:56.940
I believe because

02:11:56.940 --> 02:12:02.700
Uh of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of of judo

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.540
and

02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:11.180
In the modern era when I first began jiu-jitsu body triangles were relatively rare. They were not a standard part of class

02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:12.780
um

02:12:12.780 --> 02:12:19.900
And sometime around the late 1990s early 2000s people started to realize hey, this is a stronger method of control

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:21.820
um

02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:23.100
it

02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:29.020
It greatly increases the amount of control you have over your of your opponent's hips and torso over regular hooks

02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:36.540
Uh, it's not for all athletes. It's difficult for most people who are of shorter thicker statue, uh to

02:12:37.180 --> 02:12:43.020
Employ on on on big people if your opponent's very broadly built through the stomach. It's almost impossible to apply

02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:49.500
And so because it can't be applied by all people it tends not to be taught much at beginner level

02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:51.100
and

02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.980
so as a result it was always seen as a

02:12:54.940 --> 02:13:01.740
Kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad-based move for everyone

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:06.860
Or every body type in every class to employ so it just didn't get emphasized that much

02:13:06.940 --> 02:13:08.860
But in top level competition now

02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:15.900
I think you would see that it's very apparent that the vast majority of athletes whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between

02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:22.060
Body triangle and regular rear mounts the majority of modern athletes would choose a body triangle

02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:27.820
so we also had this conversation about wrestling and maybe george you can comment on like what's the uh,

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:29.820
The highest percentage

02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:34.140
Not statistically speaking. Perhaps that's also interesting as john talked about but just for you

02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:40.140
In terms of mastery of a takedown. What's what's the best way to take down a human being?

02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:43.260
in wrestling well, I

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:49.500
Personally for me it depends for every fighter are different. They they have a different set of skill

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:53.180
For me, I when I look someone

02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:57.900
Want to bring down a tree a big strong high tree

02:13:58.940 --> 02:14:00.940
He cut it from the base

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:06.700
So the legs that that's what we stand on so it was to attack the leg

02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:10.140
but is it single leg double leg is it we talked about like, uh,

02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:17.180
There's also the the john smith low single actually, I don't even know if that's applicable for jiu-jitsu at all

02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:24.540
You can use it, but it runs into problem with submission holds. Yeah, it's it's not impossible to use but without shoes

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:29.580
and in a situation where there's a whole plethora of submission holds in the scoring that

02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:32.860
It's a little more difficult to use. You know

02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:38.700
It is interesting something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story

02:14:39.100 --> 02:14:43.740
You're saying that every athlete is different, but if it's more effective for most people

02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:48.460
I mean, it's interesting. It's it's interesting what john talked about is that

02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:52.460
the highest percentage thing is actually, um

02:14:53.340 --> 02:14:55.500
In collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is

02:14:56.220 --> 02:15:01.180
On the defensive side so blocking a takedown and spinning around to the to the back

02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:04.540
So that's an interesting idea

02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:09.260
Then also there's all of these kind of going in for a singleness switching to a double or

02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:15.020
Wizard position and doing knee tap like there's all these kinds of combinations that seem to be

02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:21.260
Effective when you look at the statistics and it seems like there's uh, maybe it's a scientific way of thinking but it seems like there's

02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:29.740
Some conclusion to be drawn there. Oh, yeah, I believe you need to the high percentage move. There's a reason why it works. I think it's

02:15:30.620 --> 02:15:31.900
It's made

02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:33.900
for a bigger amount of people

02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:35.100
um

02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:37.100
For example, I one of my main

02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:39.020
strength

02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:41.340
Athletic strength is i'm i'm an explosive person

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:46.780
So i'll use technique that are explosive if I got a single leg my my one of my thing

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:49.420
I like to do is to go for the double power double

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.900
but for uh

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:56.460
Someone else we got for example in a single leg position. Maybe he likes

02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:01.500
Like body throw better. He's more a greco guy like so he or he's a judo guy

02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:03.500
He's gonna go for something something else. So

02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:10.780
But there there is move that are I would say like you just mentioned are universal like statistically speaking. They're

02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:18.860
The highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody everybody pretty much can do a an adhaka jimmy

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:20.620
You know, it's very easy

02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:24.620
But it's not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs

02:16:24.940 --> 02:16:25.740
So

02:16:25.740 --> 02:16:33.020
So those move like a rear naked choke adhaka jimmy is the highest percentage move because it's maybe more accessible

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:37.820
It's accessible for a bigger range of yeah based on the physical characteristics of the people

02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:45.020
Do you draw any wisdom from these high percentages john for like in terms of what to focus on? Yeah, absolutely

02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:49.340
Um judo has an ocean of moves and you can get lost on that ocean

02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:54.060
You can drift for a long period of time and and and that was very little to show for it

02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.580
So my whole thing is focus. We only live one lifetime

02:16:58.220 --> 02:17:01.580
And your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime

02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:04.220
So in that time

02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:06.620
I put a die on the mat

02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:14.780
That's the same. Yeah, um, uh, I I put a very high value on

02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:18.540
Choosing what I believe to be the most high percentage

02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:23.260
Uh moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them

02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:30.700
Um, the only problem is that in one generation a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be high

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:36.220
Percentage in another generation. For example, we talked earlier about leg locks when I was first started judo

02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:39.340
they were considered the ultimate low percentage move and

02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:46.460
Uh a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact that was that was incorrect that they can be a high percentage

02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.700
Move if we just change our approach to them

02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:50.380
um

02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:52.060
so we can't just

02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:56.140
Follow tradition and say oh, this is low percentage. This is a high percentage

02:17:56.220 --> 02:18:01.360
It has to be part of a fairly systematic study where you investigate

02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:08.540
What are the reasons why it's high percentage or low percentage with regards take downs?

02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:13.820
If you look at what we can consider the most high percentage take downs

02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:19.020
If you're in front of someone the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs

02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.860
And push them backwards

02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:24.060
Okay, if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them

02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:29.740
They can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and funk their way out of takedowns and cause all kinds of problems

02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:33.900
For you. I don't care how athletic your opponent is if you get a hold a firm grip

02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:38.060
Of both of his legs and start pushing him backwards. He's going to fall down to his butt

02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:41.340
Now he might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down

02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:44.940
Even easier than that is to be behind someone

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:50.780
Takedowns from in front of someone are difficult you go right into their hips their head their hands

02:18:50.780 --> 02:18:52.380
You go into all their defensive weapons

02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:57.500
If you're already behind someone and you're doing what in america they refer to as a mat return

02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:01.180
This is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front

02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:04.780
If you have control of their head in a front headlock position

02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:11.180
You've already closed distance on your opponent. You already have close contact. You don't have to worry about shooting anymore

02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:14.860
There's no sprawl out of that you don't have to worry about guillotines kimoras or the

02:19:15.660 --> 02:19:20.140
Standard defenses those will intrinsically be easier to take downs out of front headlock

02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:24.860
And so if we're going to talk about high percentage technique, I always go back to the mechanics of it

02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:31.500
Rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong. It was wrong about leg locks

02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:33.900
It can be wrong about other things too

02:19:34.060 --> 02:19:36.940
So my primary thing is okay talk to me about mechanics

02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:41.260
That's what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.780
um

02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:47.980
Gordon pointed out earlier that when you're behind someone you have innate physical advantages over the other guy the human

02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:52.940
The human body is set up entirely to defend to defend threats from the front

02:19:53.580 --> 02:19:58.700
We are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. We don't have eyes in the back of our head

02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.380
We can't apply pushing strength backwards if you get behind someone

02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:06.780
Take downs are 10 times easier from behind someone than they are when you're in front of someone

02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:11.260
If you have to take someone down from the front get a hold of both of their legs

02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:16.300
If you can get a hold of both of their legs and a part of pushing force, you will almost always knock them down

02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:21.260
If you can get a hold of their head

02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:23.420
And work takedowns from there again

02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:29.580
It's much easier because most of their defensive apparatus has been taken away from them before the takedown even begins

02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:31.100
And so

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:35.340
For me the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front double legs

02:20:35.740 --> 02:20:40.140
From any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front

02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:44.060
So all manner of mat return takedowns are going to be very high percentage

02:20:44.700 --> 02:20:45.820
um

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:51.820
And takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you and you have either front headlock or front chest

02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:55.420
Wrap position are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open

02:20:56.380 --> 02:20:58.700
Of course, you have to consider the full

02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:06.700
Spectrum of mechanics involved here. It's possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is much higher percentage

02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:09.260
It's like there's a lot of chain wrestling

02:21:09.340 --> 02:21:14.780
Yeah, you know that needs to be considered as a possibility maybe a straight on double and part of this cultural too

02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:19.340
Are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks?

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:21.660
Are people aware of this?

02:21:21.660 --> 02:21:24.940
Are they worried about this? Are they training for this to defend this?

02:21:25.580 --> 02:21:28.860
and and then this opponent specific of course that um

02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:33.420
You know with jordan boros people are preparing for the double which is why he had to develop

02:21:34.860 --> 02:21:39.980
A whole other kinds of different stuff and then the head to all the different controls all the different ties

02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:42.380
within the rule set

02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:47.500
And that's where it's so fascinating to see the effect of rule set on all of this judo over the past

02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:54.300
I think 20 years went through this every olympics different changes to the rule set like fundamentally different

02:21:54.780 --> 02:21:58.060
In terms of what's allowed to grip whether you're allowed to touch the legs at all

02:21:58.140 --> 02:22:00.780
That was a big one in 2012. I think

02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:04.620
And and that changed the sport completely and so interesting

02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:09.740
It's so interesting to watch how a tiny change in the rule can change the sport

02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:13.660
At the highest when you're talking about people competing at the highest level

02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:16.540
and the cool thing there is

02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:20.780
The rule change happens on a scale of every four years

02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:24.860
So you get to see people that are at the top of their game

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:27.420
Have to like recompute

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:30.860
So it's not like you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. They have to figure

02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:36.780
Oh shit, you're not allowed to like it's it's the equivalent of saying you're not allowed to kick anymore in mma

02:22:37.660 --> 02:22:40.540
Because you were not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo

02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:43.500
interestingly if you look at the

02:22:44.380 --> 02:22:45.820
case of judo

02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.820
If you look at the world rankings

02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:49.980
of athletes

02:22:49.980 --> 02:22:57.340
When they went through one of the most significant rule changes in judo history where they banned any form of grabbing the legs

02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:01.340
The ranking of athletes didn't change much

02:23:02.620 --> 02:23:06.380
Yeah, that tells you that they're there's a reason why those guys are at the top

02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:09.820
Yeah, and it doesn't have to do that. They're specific to a rule set

02:23:10.540 --> 02:23:12.540
Yeah, think about that in terms of

02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:16.460
Imagine for example in mixed martial arts if they just said hey

02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:18.780
Starting next week

02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.300
Instead of having three five minute rounds. It's going to be 15 minutes straight

02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:26.700
That would massively change the preparation of the athletes

02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:34.220
It's a different game at that point and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010 and yet

02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:40.220
The international rankings didn't really change that much the countries that were dominant before

02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:45.740
Remain dominant the athletes that remain before largely remain the same

02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:53.980
You would think was such a massive change all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren't and uh again

02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:58.700
It goes back to this idea that there's a reason why the guys at the top are at the top

02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:03.020
And now for something completely different we talked about aliens earlier

02:24:04.060 --> 02:24:07.340
so, uh george brought up babasar I I um

02:24:08.300 --> 02:24:11.740
We'll likely probably talk to babasar on this podcast and then um

02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:19.980
And then john had a skeptical look on his face about about aliens. So let me ask john and gordon

02:24:20.860 --> 02:24:28.060
Do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own the universe is

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:36.060
unimaginably large the idea that we are the only life forms and a cosmos as large as this is

02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:39.820
I think naive and foolish

02:24:39.980 --> 02:24:41.820
um

02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:49.580
There's a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet that it could have done so on many many other planets around the

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:51.580
cosmos

02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:58.940
I think anyone who puts even a moment's thought into this would realize that there's almost certainly other forms of life out there

02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:03.820
the real question with regards the alien community is um

02:25:04.300 --> 02:25:06.860
Have they got here and are they circling our planet?

02:25:07.420 --> 02:25:09.660
in um little silver sources and

02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:18.620
Making observations and periodically stealing people for experimentation purposes doesn't have to be silver saucers. It could be different other color saucers

02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:23.420
Um and that question i'm i'm i'm not at all convinced. No, I didn't

02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.620
recently um navy footage

02:25:27.180 --> 02:25:29.180
has come out showing

02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:33.740
Some very interesting phenomena if you talk to almost any experienced pilot

02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:39.100
They will tell you they've seen things in the upper atmosphere that are very difficult to explain

02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:41.500
I'll be the first one to agree with you on this

02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:45.900
There are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain like literally ufos

02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:49.100
Unidentified yeah, I mean we just don't know what they are

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:53.740
but to go from the idea that there's things out there that we don't understand to

02:25:55.100 --> 02:25:56.220
there's

02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:57.180
like

02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:01.260
Little creatures running around and um, and these somehow exist

02:26:01.740 --> 02:26:02.940
uh

02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:08.140
I just reserve judgment. I just say i'm i'm agnostic about these things. I think it's possible but

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:14.940
All the evidence that i've been showing so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until

02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:22.620
Aliens land in central park on tuesday afternoon at 3 pm and get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people

02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:24.380
I don't believe in

02:26:24.380 --> 02:26:26.380
Many of the stories that get told

02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:33.260
Well, what about if it's not little aliens with ray guns, but something very different very very difficult to detect for us humans

02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:40.000
Us very human-centric at that point. It's a it's a fascinating idea and it's certainly possible, but show me the evidence

02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.820
All right, what about you gordon

02:26:44.300 --> 02:26:51.260
Do you do you look at the cosmos and ponder the stars often? I think it's fair points john raised

02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:53.980
uh, something really interesting I saw the other day was uh

02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:56.380
someone posted like

02:26:56.380 --> 02:26:58.780
If an alien organ or civilization

02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:04.300
65 million light years away somehow managed to look at earth

02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:10.620
They would theoretically see the dinosaurs because they're 65 million light years away. So like imagine us looking at

02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:15.900
Galaxies that are 100 million light years away. That's 100 million years ago. You have no idea what it looks like now

02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:18.140
Um, so that's what's super interesting to me about it

02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:25.420
Yeah, the the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there and um

02:27:26.060 --> 02:27:29.180
The scary thing of course is if they haven't visited us yet

02:27:29.980 --> 02:27:31.500
the

02:27:31.500 --> 02:27:33.500
There has to be a good reason for it

02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:36.700
and the the set of scary reasons of all the fact that they

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:43.980
Maybe once it gets sufficiently advanced in your development you destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now

02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:47.660
We more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely

02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:50.620
in terms of our weapon systems

02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:54.780
Um, and we're developing them more and more and they're becoming better and better

02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:59.340
And then we're starting to get angry and anger on twitter and instagram at each other

02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:02.300
It's those are good points you're raising

02:28:03.100 --> 02:28:09.980
Uh, history has taught us that everything that lives one day will die so we will we will perish one day

02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:14.540
Yeah, there's also just the the sheer difficulty of um

02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:16.700
of

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:22.320
Of travel through space like space is an unimaginably inhospitable environment

02:28:23.020 --> 02:28:25.020
And to the best of our knowledge

02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:32.460
This even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space even if we could

02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:36.860
Travel at the speed of light. We're not even remotely close to that

02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:43.580
Still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems are

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:47.120
Very very long if you look at astronauts

02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:51.980
Who have spent significant amounts of time in space just orbiting the earth?

02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:56.620
It has severe health effects on them. We're just not built for space. We're supposed to be

02:28:57.260 --> 02:28:59.260
In a gravitational environment

02:28:59.260 --> 02:29:03.500
But we you're referring to your biological meat bag that's containing the essence

02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:07.740
Of the mind that is john donahue. Maybe we can transfer the mind

02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:09.420
alone

02:29:09.420 --> 02:29:13.420
So the the the the bag the meat the meat bag is not designed for space

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.140
But maybe the content of the mind is

02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:17.500
It's

02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:22.780
It's possible, but what do you think concrete evidence you folks who like difficult things?

02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:27.500
Uh, what do you think about Elon musk going to colonize mars?

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:33.660
Is this something you find an interesting or a um

02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:39.580
Aimless pursuit I think it's a must or a salvation

02:29:39.900 --> 02:29:43.420
We need to leave at some point the planet because historically in the past

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:46.220
We know that we've been bombarded by asteroid

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:48.300
volcano

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:52.860
There are crazy things happen here. It's very unstable. You know, we if you look at it to

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:58.860
Through a lifetime of a human being it's nothing but just look 12 000 years ago what happened, you know

02:29:59.260 --> 02:30:03.740
So there is cataclysm that happened all the time. It's very unstable. So

02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:10.060
If we want to survive as a species, I think it's it's we need to get out to be able to get out and

02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:16.300
Spread or seed so these are the early steps on a on a really long journey, but is there something about like

02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:22.300
You know, we we don't get that exploration from most of modern society, you know

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:26.860
the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries of uh, you know coming to the

02:30:27.580 --> 02:30:33.420
North america just throughout we were shrouded in physical uncertainty of what's out there

02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:37.020
And now we get to do the same kind of exploration with mars

02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:44.220
Is there so I mean is there any aspect of you that wants to travel out to space that wants to travel to mars

02:30:44.860 --> 02:30:48.140
There, you know, the goal is to allow civilians to travel

02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:51.020
Perhaps in our lifetime

02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:53.840
Meaning affordably you can do so now unaffordably

02:30:54.860 --> 02:30:59.980
Traveling to space and traveling to mars are two different things. I think I would like to travel into space

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:04.780
I don't know if I would like to travel all the way to mars because of the risks involved

02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:07.740
Just because

02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:08.940
Boring

02:31:08.940 --> 02:31:12.380
Is there some part of you that enjoys that if I was like towards the end of my life

02:31:12.700 --> 02:31:17.580
I would like to travel to mars just just just the experience. Yeah, but if I go to mars i'm not coming back

02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:19.500
Like that's it

02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:21.500
one-way ticket

02:31:21.660 --> 02:31:24.780
May with the technology we have now maybe in the future maybe our

02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:31.980
The children of our children will will be able to to experience that to go to do what the the weekend

02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:34.380
Mars

02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:39.500
Well, the the whole design of the starship that the space x is working on is supposed to come back

02:31:40.300 --> 02:31:44.620
Supposed to be reusable. So it's not it's not a one-way ticket. That's the whole point

02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:50.060
It's always going back and forth back and forth. What's the time frame between two planets?

02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:54.940
Like to travel from I think the current thing you'd be stuck on mars for two years

02:31:55.500 --> 02:32:00.380
But how long does it take to get from earth to mars? Oh, it's pretty i'm not exactly sure but it's pretty quick

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:05.580
It's pretty quick like I don't know and the scale of months not scale of years

02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:10.460
You might not be healthy when you come back, you know all the astronaut they experience health issues

02:32:10.620 --> 02:32:16.700
You know, they lose a lot of muscle mass bone density. So yeah, I don't think the technology is good right now. I mean

02:32:17.500 --> 02:32:22.300
Let's say that it is I would love to be doing it for a weekend if it's safe

02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:28.060
I would be the first one to do a or a professional fighter who sacrifices body for something

02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:32.540
So there's some sacrifice we do in life, right? I don't want to be the first

02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:36.220
I wouldn't want to I leave the other one but when I know it's it's safe

02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:40.700
Okay count me in so one of the things that people say and this is something I wonder about is

02:32:41.260 --> 02:32:46.780
It's like having children or something. Once you see once you're out in space and you look out and you see earth

02:32:46.940 --> 02:32:51.980
You look back at earth. That's an experience. It's unlike anything else like you can't replicate it here

02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:55.820
Um is to look back at that like blue dot

02:32:56.780 --> 02:32:58.780
And that nerve-wracking

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:02.780
Like you see like earth disappear into the distance

02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:08.140
Yeah, yeah disappear into the distance and then you get to actually stand on mars and see

02:33:08.700 --> 02:33:11.740
And just to look you're standing on the ground and you're looking out

02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:16.220
And you see the planet from which you came and where you might not be coming back

02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:19.740
But there's a challenge to the whole thing where the risk is tremendous

02:33:20.700 --> 02:33:21.660
And

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:26.540
I don't know. I find that risk really compelling for some reason but that could be just the exploration

02:33:27.180 --> 02:33:29.980
I guess that's a genetic thing too. How much do you want to explore?

02:33:31.660 --> 02:33:38.060
There's a sense though in which even in the best case scenario where they did get the technology to whisk you to mars in a

02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:42.140
Fairly short period of time. It's kind of an

02:33:42.760 --> 02:33:45.260
inauthentic sense of exploration because

02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:48.060
your participation in it is

02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:51.020
No more exciting than

02:33:51.100 --> 02:33:54.700
Your participation in an airline flight to a foreign country

02:33:55.020 --> 02:33:58.940
You're basically you you didn't have anything to do with the creation of the of the vessel

02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:01.420
You're not in command of the vessel. You're not

02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:04.540
In any way shape or form important to the mission

02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:07.020
You're just a person sitting in a passenger seat

02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:11.980
And you get off in a destination the same way you would if you flew to singapore or london or someplace like that

02:34:12.460 --> 02:34:14.220
Well, there's a hierarchy

02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:17.340
Of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people and they all have roles

02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:24.620
You don't get to go to mars without having some skill set to contribute. You made it sound like space tourism where you just pay a ticket

02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:29.980
I don't I think it's a long time before you have space tourism to mars where you have nothing to contribute

02:34:30.860 --> 02:34:34.060
Okay, like you will have to do what you do. You go through like a training program

02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:39.740
You go training program and then there's uh, there's technical things you'll be contributing so they would bring people

02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:43.820
You know in terms of aquaculture, I don't know. Okay, so this is this is better

02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:48.140
This sounds like they're actual they're more like explorers like if you talked before about

02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.760
explorers and and human history where

02:34:51.080 --> 02:34:55.980
Magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function. They were they were all

02:34:57.020 --> 02:35:02.220
Into the mission in a very authentic fashion if they weren't on the boat the performance of the crew would somehow suffer

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:08.380
So this sounds much better and with just like with Magellan. I think most of the crew died

02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:10.940
A significant number did yeah

02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:15.740
And from uh, yeah from bacteria

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:20.220
I mean from things that are unexpected and so on and if we discover life on mars

02:35:20.700 --> 02:35:25.020
I mean, who knows what that entails because that's like a man mission to mars

02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:28.860
would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of

02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:36.460
Exploration required to find life now from uh, mr musk's uh

02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:41.820
Point of view as a developer presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here, too

02:35:42.460 --> 02:35:47.740
is there some kind of financial benefit to mars missions is is

02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:50.380
presumably

02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.340
um

02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:57.580
There wouldn't be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of research and development that would require this

02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:01.420
Is there some kind of mining on mars of minerals that would be useful?

02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:03.340
I think there's a lot of answers to this

02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:09.500
But the only honest answer is the one that looks back into human history where we did a lot of things just because we we could

02:36:10.300 --> 02:36:16.220
A lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of innovation that ultimately made our life better

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.020
So this is more this is why you have nasa

02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:24.940
This is why you have government organizations like what's the purpose of nasa nasa would answer that by saying, okay

02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:26.380
Well, we're helping

02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:29.900
Launch satellites up there all the they'll have a bunch of answers

02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:32.140
But the reality is the programs

02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:34.140
were

02:36:34.140 --> 02:36:37.900
funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown

02:36:38.620 --> 02:36:43.900
and um, there's some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking

02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:50.620
That has produced a lot of cool things along the way. They were totally unexpected like uh, but nasa is funded by

02:36:51.100 --> 02:36:53.100
public funding the taxpayer

02:36:53.180 --> 02:36:56.060
Uh, how is mr musk going to fund this?

02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:03.260
Well currently most of the funding was space x is nasa giving money, uh to

02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:09.580
So they're making a competition who can who can get our satellites. We need to go to

02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:11.580
um

02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:13.580
you know was for the space station to

02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:19.660
Resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up who's going to carry those quote-unquote payloads

02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:22.860
They just need so nasa is paying whoever the heck wants to

02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:25.020
uh get

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:27.900
kilograms of thing up into space

02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:32.220
Why did this is nasa's specialty? Why did they just give up on that?

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:39.980
What they why they realized when mr musk came along and then bezels and others that said we can do it for one tenth the price

02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:45.980
So why did the why should the taxpayers pay for the why don't you nasa do what you do?

02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:50.300
Well, which is like test out cutting edge stuff. Make sure they're safe

02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:52.060
and now

02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:54.060
That we've developed

02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:55.740
um a car

02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:58.780
Let us let us ups and fedex take care of

02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:01.820
Doing this at scale doing it cheap or doing it better

02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:07.580
I mean, that's the argument and nasa took what they realized is it took way way too long to do stuff

02:38:08.380 --> 02:38:12.060
When you're investing millions if there's billions of dollars into a project

02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:13.740
the

02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:15.740
the bureaucracy builds up

02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:20.300
And the conservatism builds up to where you're I mean you really have to test everything out

02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:26.860
So projects take years and then you have somebody like gilam musk coming along and says well, let's do launches every

02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:32.780
Every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket we'll reuse the rocket

02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:35.680
That was one of the sort of cutting edge inventions

02:38:36.300 --> 02:38:38.300
It's a dumb obvious idea

02:38:39.100 --> 02:38:41.260
Like gilam says why do you throw away the play?

02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:44.300
It's the equivalent as if you flew a plane every time you threw it away

02:38:44.780 --> 02:38:46.780
Why are we every time throwing away the plane?

02:38:46.860 --> 02:38:51.420
But nasa tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s and yes

02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:57.500
Well, they did that with the space shuttle, but not not at the scale here that uh, it was the space shuttle was seen as this

02:38:58.140 --> 02:38:59.160
like

02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:05.820
Majestic amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment with the old musk is like no every basic rocket

02:39:06.380 --> 02:39:07.980
Should be reusable

02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:11.260
next cut cost cut cost do you do you think like

02:39:12.140 --> 02:39:15.100
The more technology we have the more advanced we become the more

02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:20.620
Specialized we need to be like is that for that reason that now they they there is different branch

02:39:20.700 --> 02:39:25.740
Like you just explained now now there's other specialized in this but they left, you know other branch

02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:31.020
Yeah, there's there's greater and greater specializations. We build up more stuff, which is fascinating because

02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:33.980
Is it making us?

02:39:34.220 --> 02:39:35.100
more

02:39:35.100 --> 02:39:39.020
dumb in a way do you think like like like yeah, I don't know like

02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:43.740
You you know, but like I use a cell phone, but I don't know how to build it up from

02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:47.580
Like I mean, it's that beta males building up this whole society

02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:52.860
Um, because we're this collective intelligence. We rely on each other more and more

02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:54.380
and

02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:55.340
it

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:59.820
I do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things because

02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:07.260
Like i've been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently it's fascinating it's fascinating

02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:10.540
There's a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and

02:40:11.580 --> 02:40:17.740
That idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas. That's the one that takes hold for a large number of people

02:40:18.300 --> 02:40:19.740
and

02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:24.540
I think that's the consequences of this kind of specialization where it's just a huge amount of experts

02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:30.060
But if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence

02:40:30.700 --> 02:40:34.860
We are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to

02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:41.660
General thinkers, we're like extremely good at specific things. Are we capable now to do

02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:44.460
A robot that is self aware

02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:47.420
That's that's one the legged one

02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:52.300
Uh, it's self aware like it's not self aware. It's been listening, but it's not self aware currently

02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:56.620
But do you think a human being is self aware or that's a good question

02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:01.500
I mean, I ask this question all the time when the robots move. There's a sense of

02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:08.460
When they turn on something entered that robot wow and when it turns off something left

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:15.420
Uh, if they move in a certain kind of way and if they're if they surprise you there's certain elements

02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:18.140
that enable us

02:41:18.300 --> 02:41:20.300
to see the magic in

02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:25.660
In a living being and some of them I mean we can character we can maybe list them

02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:28.300
But it's the ability to surprise you

02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:30.860
it's the

02:41:32.460 --> 02:41:38.060
Ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly. There's a bunch of things that you just

02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:41.100
I don't know. It just feels

02:41:41.100 --> 02:41:44.460
like it has the magic of what is a living being and

02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:49.820
Which is what humans have and I try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine?

02:41:50.460 --> 02:41:54.380
So when you turn it on and off you feel like it dies every time and he

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:59.420
Reborn, right? So for most machines, we don't feel that way. We don't when we unplug things

02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:06.300
We don't feel that way. I don't know why we don't feel that way. That's an interesting question, but I think when

02:42:08.700 --> 02:42:10.700
When the robot has certain qualities

02:42:11.900 --> 02:42:13.900
like memory

02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:15.900
Like ability to recognize you

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:19.420
Yeah, you start to feel like you're turning off an organism

02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:24.220
So so whenever I have like the robots that recognize me and remember

02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:28.460
This is important that all the things we've experienced together

02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:31.180
Then it's like holy shit

02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:36.220
That's a that's a living thing. But does he remember it feels like a living thing. Does he remember

02:42:36.940 --> 02:42:43.260
Your robot does he remember things that happened before you unplugged him? Is it like he's sleeping?

02:42:43.980 --> 02:42:48.540
Like is he wake up or is he like that? So right now we start to zero everything

02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:54.060
Uh, no, it doesn't start zero. Remember it remembers everything. That's the key every time you like you you unplug

02:42:54.380 --> 02:43:00.620
Wow, it's storing the storing the memory, but the memories are basic they're like, okay, we walked around the kitchen and then

02:43:01.740 --> 02:43:08.140
Um, you looked at me. I mean the memories it's like data. It's just it's not like we've experienced it's able to actually

02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:13.420
Uh experience anything deep like we humans can but just the fact of memory

02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:18.860
It's like the toaster or the microwave. Don't don't give a shit about me

02:43:19.500 --> 02:43:23.420
They don't know me. They don't know me by name. They wouldn't recognize my face

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:27.820
As being different from gordon's they wouldn't know the difference and they wouldn't

02:43:28.440 --> 02:43:33.920
Remember the microwave currently doesn't remember, you know the times i've been sad or happy

02:43:34.460 --> 02:43:37.660
Like what food I put into it. It doesn't remember this

02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:41.260
when I was being a fat ass or what I was being in good shape and

02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:46.140
All just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off

02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:48.860
That's like shit

02:43:48.860 --> 02:43:53.740
That's a living that's that that's a living thing disappearing. Of course, that's kind of an anthropomorphism

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:55.740
We do to each other

02:43:55.740 --> 02:43:57.740
But uh, that's something

02:43:58.140 --> 02:43:59.740
You know that

02:43:59.740 --> 02:44:02.300
That's something that makes me believe it's possible to create

02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:11.020
Systems with which we can have a connection that are non-human like similar to dogs and cats and so on

02:44:11.900 --> 02:44:17.020
It just makes me and that's what's interesting to me because ultimately I feel like they'll help us understand

02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:19.720
ourselves

02:44:20.140 --> 02:44:23.260
And maybe practice grappling moves anyway, um

02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:25.740
Okay

02:44:26.700 --> 02:44:29.100
Well, let me ask the uh advice question

02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:33.980
Uh now that we're together i've asked i've spoken to john I spoke to george

02:44:34.780 --> 02:44:37.420
What what advice would you give to young folks whether?

02:44:38.060 --> 02:44:39.660
we're talking about

02:44:39.660 --> 02:44:40.620
sport

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:47.980
Like excelling becoming great at grappling becoming great at fighting become a great at whatever sport they take on or life in general

02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:50.380
Whether they're maybe in high school or in college

02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:52.940
What advice would you give them to?

02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:55.180
excel

02:44:55.180 --> 02:45:00.940
At that thing they take on I don't know if i'm qualified to answer this because i'm only 26

02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:04.540
So you're at the top you said you said giving advice to young people

02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:06.220
um

02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:08.220
For me, I think the two biggest things are

02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:12.380
Find something that you're both talented in and you enjoy

02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:13.980
um

02:45:13.980 --> 02:45:18.780
I think that if you enjoy something but you're terrible at it. It's going to be hard for you to be successful

02:45:19.500 --> 02:45:21.580
In life at that given in that given area

02:45:22.060 --> 02:45:26.540
Um, and it's going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time

02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:32.060
Uh, if you're talented at it, but you don't enjoy doing it. Um, it's easy to come in

02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:33.740
and

02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:34.860
train

02:45:34.860 --> 02:45:37.580
Hard for a month or for two months or for a year

02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:39.660
You can be very talented at it

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:44.940
But if you come in it's but it's a different story to come in every day for five years in a row for 10 years

02:45:44.940 --> 02:45:47.340
In a row for 15 years in a row. Um, so I think

02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:50.860
I think finding something that you're both talented in

02:45:51.740 --> 02:45:57.340
And something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me. How do you find the joy in it?

02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:02.220
So you've been training insane amount, you know a lot even doing it for a long time

02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:05.420
Is there's is there ways to rediscover the joy in it?

02:46:06.060 --> 02:46:08.060
Yeah for me initially

02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:10.860
It was just learning new stuff, you know

02:46:11.100 --> 02:46:15.020
You just come in as a white belt and every day you learn you see a different move and you're like, oh man

02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:16.620
That's that's awesome

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:22.300
Um, and then when I started to compete more seriously towards my professional career it was

02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:25.420
the joy of doing camps and

02:46:25.420 --> 02:46:28.460
Seeing the result of those camps and beating high level athletes

02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:33.020
And then it got to a point where I've beaten all the high level athletes already. So

02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.820
Who am I going to compete against?

02:46:36.220 --> 02:46:38.220
so now for me the joy is just

02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:39.900
being

02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:46.460
The best athlete I can possibly be until I reach my prime which I'm hoping is somewhere between 35

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:49.980
And 40. Um, so instead of competing against the other athletes

02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:53.420
I'll be bored already because I already beat all the rest of the guys

02:46:53.900 --> 02:46:55.740
um, but

02:46:55.740 --> 02:47:01.100
I know that i know that I can be better in a year from now or two years from now than I am today

02:47:01.260 --> 02:47:03.260
And that for me is exciting

02:47:04.220 --> 02:47:07.660
By the way, is there some aspect of teaching that's exciting to you?

02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:14.220
Yeah, because you become a better and better teacher over the years. Yeah. Yeah, I I definitely uh, I enjoy teaching and

02:47:15.180 --> 02:47:17.180
I used to teach um

02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:21.100
A lot before I met john and then I met john and I was like, yeah

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:25.740
I just have no idea how to teach. Um, so that's like a completely different element, uh of the sport

02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:29.980
You know doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:33.260
and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to

02:47:33.980 --> 02:47:37.100
To a vast amount of people is two completely different things

02:47:38.300 --> 02:47:40.300
george advice for young people

02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:42.780
like yourself

02:47:42.780 --> 02:47:43.900
well

02:47:43.980 --> 02:47:46.700
First I was I would tell them find

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:49.980
What you want to become what you want to do?

02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:52.540
and long term

02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:57.660
Use certain things maybe sometime you don't love but where you want to propel yourself at the future

02:47:58.140 --> 02:48:03.180
Not what your parent your your friend wants you to become what you you you want to become

02:48:04.060 --> 02:48:06.060
So once once you find it

02:48:07.180 --> 02:48:08.300
You cannot

02:48:08.380 --> 02:48:15.020
Doing it by yourself everything that are that is big achievement in life. We cannot do we doing it by ourselves

02:48:15.020 --> 02:48:17.340
so what I would say is second thing is

02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:22.540
Try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:26.300
Of people that are competent

02:48:26.700 --> 02:48:28.700
And people that you trust

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.700
You need both competency and trust

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:34.940
I see a lot of people sometime in business. For example, they hire people they

02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:38.940
That are that they trust but they turns out to be incompetent

02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:42.780
So now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business going down

02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:49.180
The same problem if you do the opposite you hire someone that is competent, but you cannot trust he's gonna he's gonna screw you, you know

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:55.420
So it's very important to stay away from the negative build up your team people you trust and that are competent

02:48:56.620 --> 02:49:02.140
And I would say the third one is to work to work hard to sacrifice yourself

02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:04.300
You have to go through hell sometime

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:07.900
But yeah, you have to see the light at the end of it, you know to

02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:11.980
Keep your dream in mind is going to give you the motivation to go through the tough time

02:49:11.980 --> 02:49:15.980
It's nothing easy to go work work work is nothing you can accomplish without hard work

02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:20.300
The fourth one I would say

02:49:20.460 --> 02:49:27.180
To invest on yourself constantly if you do not invest on yourself on whatever you are in which business and sport

02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:29.740
The game will catch up to you

02:49:29.900 --> 02:49:31.900
For example, if you're if you become

02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:39.180
Champion at something and you stop improving the other guys that are trying to be champion. They're gonna catch up to you

02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:42.380
So you need to invest on yourself and most people

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:45.740
Most athletes they make the mistake when they start to have money

02:49:46.700 --> 02:49:48.620
They buy luxury stuff

02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:51.420
And that's one thing I didn't do when I started making money

02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:56.220
I was investing of on traveling to new york training with john garden and the guys to learn

02:49:56.940 --> 02:50:02.060
What is new in the the game of jiu-jitsu I used to go in thailand train muay thai

02:50:02.780 --> 02:50:04.780
uh

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:07.180
In las angeles to perfect my boxing skill

02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:14.460
So instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry cars and to to do what a lot of guys do because it's a mistake

02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:19.580
I I invested on myself because I know there were people coming. They don't want my place

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:21.580
So I want I didn't want them to catch me

02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:25.340
And the last one I would say it seems weird

02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:28.140
I would say

02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:32.220
To give back and it's not because i'm a nice guy and it's not that

02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:35.020
I don't say that to look good. I say that

02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:38.140
When you you make it

02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:43.420
It creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:51.340
But when I say give back not give back to everybody to anybody give back only to the the cause that you want

02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:53.100
I give back

02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:57.820
Not because i'm a nice guy. I'm kind of it's kind of selfish. I only give back to the people that I want to give back

02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:02.160
Because I give back to them and I know that if i'm more successful

02:51:02.780 --> 02:51:07.580
I'm going to be able to give back to people I loved the cause that that that count for me

02:51:07.980 --> 02:51:11.660
So it's it brings me more motivation because I don't compete

02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:16.060
For myself anymore. I compete to help people I love in a way

02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:23.100
So at when you you reach the top in your game you need to find new motivation if you satisfy

02:51:23.340 --> 02:51:26.620
Is is the end of it your success will go down

02:51:27.020 --> 02:51:30.700
So you need to to to find new motivation. What can motivate you?

02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:35.020
You know, what do you want? Oh, I want to help this so I need to to be successful. I want to

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:39.900
You know, you need to find reason who you what do you want to do with your success?

02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:45.660
So when I say give back, it's not because i'm not because i'm necessarily it's not to be to look like a nice guy

02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:48.140
to keep your motivation

02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:49.500
to be able to

02:51:49.500 --> 02:51:51.500
Keep climbing the ladder even more

02:51:52.860 --> 02:51:54.860
That's beautiful. Joy

02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:56.220
john

02:51:56.220 --> 02:51:57.180
um

02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:03.180
First off the two responses given so far covered. I think the most important things already. Um

02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:10.300
Gordon talked about the the need for an underlying passion and enjoyment if you don't have that

02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:14.060
You're not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build

02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:18.620
Skills which is ultimately everything's going to come down to your ability to build skills

02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:23.420
You've got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment which will keep you in the game long enough

02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:30.300
To build world championship skills. It's going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that

02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:32.060
um

02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:36.140
George talked about the idea of community. You're not going to make it by yourself

02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:43.020
So you've got to be able to build people around you and and build a trusting environment around you to develop those skills

02:52:43.580 --> 02:52:45.020
um

02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.780
What I would add to the the excellent points that both already raised

02:52:50.060 --> 02:52:54.380
Alludes to what I said at the start of this podcast. You've got to be able to identify

02:52:55.180 --> 02:52:57.180
some kind of undervalued

02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:02.780
Elements in whatever industry you're in and show the world what their true value is

02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:05.660
in addition

02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:07.660
You can't go through life

02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:10.460
Doing the same things as everybody else

02:53:11.100 --> 02:53:13.100
And expecting to get different results

02:53:13.500 --> 02:53:17.260
This is straightforwardly irrational and worse. It's even arrogant

02:53:17.500 --> 02:53:23.020
It's essentially the statement that i'm going to do the same thing as everyone else, but I believe i'm different

02:53:23.820 --> 02:53:25.820
And so they'll work for me

02:53:25.820 --> 02:53:27.820
But they didn't work for everyone else

02:53:27.900 --> 02:53:29.900
That's like saying no i'm special

02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:33.180
No, you're not special. We're all pretty much the same

02:53:33.900 --> 02:53:40.220
And um in order to be special you're going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don't have

02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:43.020
um

02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:47.420
Thirdly, I would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:50.940
You've got to be able to focus on one or two things

02:53:51.740 --> 02:53:54.060
That you do better than anyone else in your industry

02:53:55.580 --> 02:53:57.260
You can't learn everything

02:53:57.260 --> 02:54:02.140
But you can get one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are the better

02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:07.420
And you can truly excel at them. For example at the peak of his career

02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:13.180
No one in the world was better than george saint pierre at integrating striking and takedowns

02:54:14.060 --> 02:54:18.220
No one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground

02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:26.140
He had two things that he could confidently say he was the best in the world at was he the best at every mma skill. Nope

02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:28.380
but he was

02:54:28.380 --> 02:54:34.060
Absolutely the best at those two skills and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win

02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:36.540
the vast majority of his matches

02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:42.780
Gordon ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say there's no one in the world better than me at leg locks

02:54:44.140 --> 02:54:48.060
He could also say there's no one better in the world than me at late stage defense

02:54:49.580 --> 02:54:54.060
To submission holds across the board as he went through his career

02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:58.780
He started adding more and more elements. It's gotten to an extraordinary degree now where you could

02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:02.860
Absolutely say he's the best at guard passing the best at guard retention

02:55:03.500 --> 02:55:06.300
The less this keeps going on and that goes back to what

02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:08.140
um

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:14.860
Gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we're always introducing new skill sets the day you start saying

02:55:15.420 --> 02:55:18.460
I'm satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored

02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:22.540
and bored boredom to an athlete is a precursor to

02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:26.060
Death by boredom. Um

02:55:26.540 --> 02:55:29.820
As long as you're still growing in those directions, you'll stay in the game

02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:37.580
For for very long periods of time. So the main thing I would add to these, uh, uh statements by gordon and george

02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:39.820
Is this idea of?

02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:43.740
Finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is

02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:47.820
Understanding

02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:54.380
That you can't just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else

02:55:54.700 --> 02:55:55.820
You've got to

02:55:55.820 --> 02:56:03.340
Almost every great rise in human civilization whether it be groups of people or individuals required some kind of innovation

02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:09.100
You've got to look for that new angle. Okay, george st. Pierre found it with shoot boxing early on in his career

02:56:09.660 --> 02:56:15.180
Uh gordon ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they branched out from that from that angle

02:56:18.060 --> 02:56:21.100
Add to this the idea that you want to become

02:56:21.580 --> 02:56:27.340
The absolute best in the world in your industry in one or two things that make a difference

02:56:27.900 --> 02:56:32.060
Find out what they are and focus on those things and you'll go far

02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:34.700
John

02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:41.340
Gordon george, this is an incredible conversation. Thank you so much for your extremely valuable time george as somebody

02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:43.900
Who's become famous in part?

02:56:44.700 --> 02:56:46.700
By commenting on people's performance

02:56:47.580 --> 02:56:50.060
Um, how do you think we did?

02:56:51.020 --> 02:56:53.420
How would you evaluate our performance today?

02:56:54.460 --> 02:56:56.460
I'm not impressed by you

02:56:57.660 --> 02:57:01.820
Thank you. I loved it. I i've learned all the time. I've talked to you guys. I'm

02:57:02.460 --> 02:57:07.820
It's it's great. I loved it. It was very stimulated. I and really enjoyed it

02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:13.260
Yeah, it's uh, it was it was something. I really was looking forward to I was hoping that we'd get together

02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:17.100
It's so rare that at the same time in history

02:57:17.100 --> 02:57:21.580
There would be some of the greats together and the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk like this

02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:26.700
This is awesome and that gordon. He would even wear a cowboy hat. I mean, this is just historic

02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:29.980
This is like church. You're all getting together with whoever, you know

02:57:30.140 --> 02:57:35.820
This is great and all but the next one is just going to be us just quizzing john on which animals would win in fights

02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:42.140
Yes for the whole three hours. It would be just so we'll invite joe and you'll just be we'll we'll make it a systematic

02:57:42.220 --> 02:57:48.060
It'll be a debate between joe and john on which animal would win john and I we have a thing that we send each other

02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:51.180
footage all the time of animal fight where

02:57:52.060 --> 02:57:55.500
We are uh, very intrigued about animal fight

02:57:57.980 --> 02:58:04.380
I get them at like 3 30 a.m. On instagram. He's like check this out like a rhino taking a like a pig like

02:58:04.860 --> 02:58:07.420
Like like like literally like it's not always fair

02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:13.660
No, no, it's not ever but interesting stuff if people would see what we send the stuff that we

02:58:14.380 --> 02:58:16.380
That would judge you harshly

02:58:16.860 --> 02:58:19.420
Yeah, all right. All right. Thanks so much guys. This was awesome

02:58:20.460 --> 02:58:26.220

And now let me leave you some words from miyamoto musashi

02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:43.200
There's nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better stronger richer quicker or smarter

02:58:43.920 --> 02:58:45.440
Everything is within

02:58:45.440 --> 02:58:47.200
everything exists

02:58:47.200 --> 02:58:49.200
Seek nothing outside of yourself

02:58:50.080 --> 02:58:52.900
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
