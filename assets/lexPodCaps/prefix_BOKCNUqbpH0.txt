WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
So the BBC reached out and said, we want to interview you.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.960
And they said, we've got this idea.

00:03.960 --> 00:08.680
We want to take you to a park and have you meet one of the protesters who've

00:08.680 --> 00:12.240
been wielding his gun outside your mosque and talk to him.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.760
It was really interesting because they'd interviewed him before meeting me and

00:16.760 --> 00:20.760
the things that he was able to utter before meeting me and before meeting

00:20.760 --> 00:24.360
Syrian refugees was just awful.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.560
I mean, the most dehumanizing rhetoric that you can imagine.

00:28.480 --> 00:33.000
But then at the park, he meets me, talks to me.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.480
He meets a Syrian refugee family.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.560
Uh, one of the girls whose leg had been blown off in an air strike.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.720
And he said, I feel like an idiot.

00:44.120 --> 00:50.600
I mean, he expressed all sorts of regret and was teary eyed that he could

00:51.040 --> 00:53.240
dehumanize people the way that he was.

00:53.280 --> 00:58.000
And so my whole thing was, and is come inside the mosque, put your gun down,

00:58.640 --> 01:04.480
disarm yourself and learn, and you'll be surprised what you'll walk away with.

01:05.440 --> 01:12.320
And only took one meeting with him to completely shift his worldview at the

01:12.320 --> 01:18.240
time, which was made up of heroes and villains, the Muslims, unfortunately

01:18.240 --> 01:21.000
being the villains that had to be wiped off the face of the earth so that

01:21.000 --> 01:21.920
the earth could continue.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.200
The following is a conversation with Imam Dr.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.120
Omar Suleiman.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.640
He's a Muslim scholar, civil rights leader, founder and president of the

01:32.640 --> 01:35.000
Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.240
And he's a professor of Islamic studies at Southern Methodist University.

01:40.760 --> 01:44.520
He's one of the most influential Muslims in the world and is a fearless,

01:44.560 --> 01:48.200
kindhearted human being who I'm now proud to call a friend.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.120
As a side note, allow me to say a few words about Israel and Palestine.

01:53.800 --> 01:57.400
While this conversation with Omar Suleiman was mostly exploring the

01:57.400 --> 02:02.760
history and beauty of Islam and the Muslim community, we did delve briefly

02:02.760 --> 02:04.760
into the topic of Israel and Palestine.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.160
This topic is an extremely challenging one and an extremely important one.

02:10.800 --> 02:16.120
It has deep roots and implications in US politics, in global geopolitics,

02:16.360 --> 02:22.320
in military and religious conflicts, wars and atrocities, and basic struggle of

02:22.320 --> 02:26.400
all human beings to survive, to protect their loved ones, and to flourish

02:26.400 --> 02:28.480
as individuals and as communities.

02:29.360 --> 02:33.320
I did not want to cover this topic in a solely scholarly fashion.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.520
Much like with the war in Ukraine, it is not simply a story of history,

02:37.520 --> 02:40.360
politics, religion, and national identity.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.960
It is also a deeply human story.

02:43.640 --> 02:47.760
To cover this topic in the way that my gut and my heart says to do it, I

02:47.760 --> 02:51.200
have to talk to everyone, to leaders and people on all sides.

02:51.600 --> 02:56.600
Muslim and Jewish, Israeli and Palestinian, from refugees to soldiers,

02:56.640 --> 02:59.000
from scholars to extremists.

02:59.960 --> 03:04.600
I'm not sure if that's possible or wise, but like Forrest Gump said,

03:05.080 --> 03:08.600
I'm not a smart man and maybe you know how the rest of that goes.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.880
I just like to follow my heart to whatever place it leads.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.640
I ask the Muslim and the Jewish communities for your patience and support.

03:18.680 --> 03:23.080
As I explore this topic, I will make many mistakes and I'll be listening

03:23.080 --> 03:26.120
to all voices so I can learn and do better.

03:27.200 --> 03:31.600
I've become distinctly aware that my approach of talking to people from all

03:31.600 --> 03:35.880
walks of life with empathy and compassion, but with backbone, can

03:35.880 --> 03:37.440
create enemies on all sides.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.120
I don't quite yet understand why this is, but I'm learning to accept

03:42.400 --> 03:43.960
it as the reality of the world.

03:44.880 --> 03:50.280
Hopefully in the end, whatever happens, whatever silly thing I do has a chance

03:50.280 --> 03:51.960
of adding a bit of love to the world.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.680
Thanks for going along with me on this journey.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.280
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.080
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

04:01.640 --> 04:05.280
And now dear friends, here's Omar Salman.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.880
As-salamu alaykum Omar.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.120
We've been trying to do this a long time.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.760
The world tried to prevent it through the funny ways that the world does,

04:14.760 --> 04:15.920
but here we are.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.000
I'm a huge fan of yours.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.200
It's a huge honor to talk to you.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.360
I appreciate it.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.720
Thank you for making the sacrifice and coming down or coming up, I guess.

04:23.280 --> 04:23.880
I appreciate it.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.320
It's a short flight, but a long journey.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.600
Let's start with the biggest question.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.720
Who is God according to Islam?

04:31.640 --> 04:36.960
God is the most compassionate, the most merciful, the creator of the heavens

04:36.960 --> 04:37.560
and the earth.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.120
He is one God.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.120
He begets not, nor is he begotten.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.320
He is unique.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.600
He is omnipotent.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.320
He is beyond the limitations of man.

04:49.120 --> 04:54.840
He is beyond the constructs of our imagination, but he is ever accessible

04:55.000 --> 04:56.400
through sincere supplication.

04:57.440 --> 05:03.240
When you call upon him alone, one God, he is closer to you than your

05:03.240 --> 05:04.960
jugular vein, the Quran tells us.

05:05.920 --> 05:10.240
He's known by many names and attributes, but his essence is one.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.040
He's one God.

05:11.800 --> 05:16.360
No human likeness, no human imperfection can be attributed to him.

05:16.760 --> 05:22.360
No partners, no image of him can be constructed.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.080
And that is God.

05:25.560 --> 05:30.240
So God represents, he is a feeling of closeness that is accessible to

05:30.240 --> 05:31.000
every human being.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.400
Well, God's not a feeling.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.120
God is known by names and attributes.

05:35.720 --> 05:41.880
We call upon God, but there is certainly a feeling of closeness when you access

05:41.880 --> 05:42.080
him.

05:42.080 --> 05:48.800
So I think the beauty of Islam is that as perfect as God is described, he's

05:48.800 --> 05:51.320
also so accessible to the imperfect.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.440
And so the idea of sincere supplication and connection to him, we worship him

05:55.440 --> 05:56.840
alone, we call upon him alone.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.960
There's no clergy, there's no barrier between God and us.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.520
And that encourages a sincere devotion and commitment to him alone.

06:09.040 --> 06:15.760
And so he is certainly described supreme and God speaks to us through the

06:15.760 --> 06:20.720
Quran and we speak to him through sincere supplication and his attributes

06:20.760 --> 06:26.360
are the furthest from us in terms of their perfection, but he is ever close

06:26.360 --> 06:29.840
to us through our supplication, through our prayers and through our connection

06:29.840 --> 06:30.240
to him.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.920
To open the door to that connection, to have a connection with God, how

06:35.920 --> 06:37.040
difficult is that process?

06:37.040 --> 06:38.360
How difficult was it for you?

06:38.600 --> 06:42.920
How difficult is it for the people that, for the many, many, many Muslims that

06:42.920 --> 06:44.240
you've interacted with?

06:45.160 --> 06:48.480
Well, I think that there are different layers of difficulty, right?

06:48.480 --> 06:53.160
There is the personal difficulty submitting yourself to God.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.680
You know, Islam requires a complete submission to him.

06:56.840 --> 07:05.240
And one of the things that happens is that if we project some of our bad

07:05.240 --> 07:10.120
experiences with authority onto our relationship with God, then we

07:10.120 --> 07:14.040
immediately perceive him in a certain way that might not allow us to gain a

07:14.040 --> 07:16.920
closeness to him because maybe we didn't have the best relationship with our

07:16.920 --> 07:17.800
parents growing up.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.880
Maybe we didn't have the best relationship with authority figures in our lives.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.080
And so this idea of an ultimate authority to whom you submit yourself can be very

07:26.080 --> 07:26.760
difficult.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.400
You know, Malcolm X, who was one of the most prominent converts to Islam in

07:30.400 --> 07:34.520
American history, talked about the difficulty of prostration for the very

07:34.520 --> 07:38.440
first time, putting your head on the ground, putting your face on the ground

07:38.520 --> 07:41.920
and praying to God is a very humbling thing.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.800
Submitting all of your affairs to him is very humbling.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.640
And ultimately you have to relinquish control and you can't relinquish control

07:49.640 --> 07:50.320
without trust.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.880
So you have to learn to trust God.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.040
To trust God, you have to know him.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.080
And to know him is to love him.

07:56.680 --> 08:03.880
And so for me personally, you know, growing up, going through certain

08:03.880 --> 08:11.320
difficulties, having a sick parent who struggled in her life with cancer and

08:11.320 --> 08:17.720
with strokes, dealing with racism in South Louisiana, growing up, it was

08:17.720 --> 08:23.080
important for me to learn about God through my difficulties, for example,

08:23.080 --> 08:25.680
rather than let those difficulties turn me away from him.

08:26.560 --> 08:31.640
Many times people put a barrier between them and God because they can't make

08:31.640 --> 08:33.800
sense of the things that are happening in their own lives.

08:34.640 --> 08:40.600
And so they project anger towards God and at the same time, deny their own

08:40.600 --> 08:45.200
belief in him and do away with this natural disposition that every one of us

08:45.200 --> 08:46.240
has to believe in him.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.520
So there are intellectual barriers, certainly there are experiential

08:50.520 --> 08:56.800
barriers, but I think that one of the beautiful things about Islam is clarity.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.120
There's an explanation for his existence.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.040
There's an explanation for our existence.

09:04.040 --> 09:08.120
There's an explanation for the existence of difficulties and trial and explanation

09:08.120 --> 09:11.720
for the existence of desires and distractions.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.320
And it all comes together so beautifully and coherently in Islam.

09:16.320 --> 09:22.320
And so I think that for many of us, we want to be our own gods, you know, and

09:22.320 --> 09:28.880
ultimately we create and fashion gods in ways that allow us to still be the

09:28.880 --> 09:32.760
ultimate determiners of our own fates, of our own story.

09:34.040 --> 09:38.040
And that's very unfulfilling when you fail at your own plan.

09:38.640 --> 09:43.560
But when you realize that there is one who was all-knowing, that there is one

09:43.560 --> 09:48.520
who is all-wise, you actually find peace in submitting yourself to him.

09:48.560 --> 09:53.760
And so submitting your will to him, submitting your desires, submitting

09:53.840 --> 09:58.560
your own fate to him becomes actually an experience of liberation because you

09:58.560 --> 10:00.520
trust the one that you're submitting to.

10:00.560 --> 10:04.720
You trust his knowledge over yours, you trust his wisdom over yours, and that

10:04.720 --> 10:05.720
gives you a lot of peace.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.240
And then you have direct access to him.

10:07.560 --> 10:13.280
You pray to him, you call upon him, you supplicate and everything in your life

10:13.280 --> 10:19.400
suddenly has meaning, you know, in our faith, everything is about intention and

10:19.400 --> 10:23.480
there is an intentionality even behind the most seemingly most mundane actions.

10:24.280 --> 10:31.760
A morsel of food in the mouth of your spouse, your family is looked at as a

10:31.760 --> 10:36.560
great charity, the way that you enter into a place and exit out of a place, what

10:36.560 --> 10:40.080
foot you step in, what foot you step out with, there's an intentionality, there's

10:40.080 --> 10:41.640
a word of remembrance that's spoken.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.760
There's a word of praise before and after you engage in any action.

10:46.360 --> 10:49.800
There are things that you say before you eat, before you sleep.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.880
There is meaning even to your sleep.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.200
One of the great companions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be

10:55.200 --> 10:59.320
upon him, he said that I seek the reward for my sleep just as I seek the reward

10:59.320 --> 11:04.200
for my prayer, because you sleep to refresh yourself so that you can once

11:04.200 --> 11:07.720
again do great things and the intentionality behind that allows even the

11:07.720 --> 11:08.840
sleep to be rewardable.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.600
You eat to nourish yourself so that you can do great things.

11:12.600 --> 11:18.360
You seek to be in a position of independence and of being sustained so

11:18.360 --> 11:19.600
that you can sustain others.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.400
So the Prophet peace be upon him says, for example, that the upper hand is better

11:23.400 --> 11:26.000
than the lower hand, the upper hand is the giving hand, the lower hand is the

11:26.000 --> 11:26.600
receiving hand.

11:26.600 --> 11:31.320
So to seek a position where you can help other people, everything becomes

11:31.320 --> 11:36.200
intentional and there's no such thing as, you know, something that is

11:36.240 --> 11:38.480
meaningless and without purpose.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.640
So every pursuit is ultimately a pursuit of God.

11:42.040 --> 11:47.280
And when you pursue God sincerely, then he rewards you, not just with paradise

11:47.280 --> 11:50.160
in the afterlife, but he rewards you with a great sense of serenity and

11:50.160 --> 11:51.320
self-satisfaction here.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.320
You mentioned part of the struggle growing up was having a parent, your

11:55.320 --> 11:57.240
mom, who was sick.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.320
What do you remember about your mom?

12:00.840 --> 12:02.880
What are some happy, pleasant memories?

12:03.720 --> 12:07.920
So my parents were, well, my father, thank God, is still alive.

12:09.920 --> 12:15.360
My mother was a pious woman, a beautiful woman, a righteous woman, a woman who

12:15.360 --> 12:18.720
was known for treating everyone with a great deal of love and respect.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.720
She was a poet.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.000
She used to write poetry about oppressed peoples around the world, from her

12:24.000 --> 12:27.440
homeland in Palestine to the genocide in Bosnia.

12:28.120 --> 12:34.040
She followed every conflict before social media and poured her heart into it.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.440
She was a woman of great charity.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.040
So when I think back to my mom growing up, she was known for her smile.

12:41.160 --> 12:46.280
My mom was always smiling and in fact, every picture of her, she's smiling.

12:47.040 --> 12:51.400
And at her funeral, you know, people talked about her smile, that she would

12:51.400 --> 12:53.240
smile at everyone and that was kind of her thing.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.040
So if you were left out of a gathering, she was smiling at you and she'd kind

12:56.040 --> 12:56.760
of welcome you in.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.560
I remember my mom to be content.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.720
She was a woman of prayer and a woman of contentment.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.680
So I used to see her in her prayer clothes all the time.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
In fact, when I think back to her growing up, I think of her more in her

13:08.200 --> 13:11.080
prayer clothes than in her normal clothes, because that's how often

13:11.080 --> 13:12.280
she was engaged in prayer.

13:13.200 --> 13:20.360
And I think of her making sure that everyone was included in a conversation.

13:20.440 --> 13:26.840
So she was very interesting in that she had several strokes and each one of

13:26.840 --> 13:31.120
those strokes impaired one of her senses to some extent.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.920
So she was partially deaf because of one stroke and she'd be sitting in a

13:34.920 --> 13:39.960
gathering and she'd be pretty quiet with a big smile on her face, very serene.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.720
And she would tell me, you know, alhamdulillah, which means thank God, all

13:44.720 --> 13:50.080
praise be to God that I can't hear because I can tell when people are

13:50.080 --> 13:53.560
gossiping, when people are saying negative things around me about other people.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.200
Because she says even the look on people's faces changes.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.720
So it was really interesting because she was that spiritually rooted and deep

14:01.720 --> 14:06.120
that she said, like, you could see on the looks on people's faces when they started

14:06.120 --> 14:09.440
to speak ill about other people, that their faces would change, that their

14:09.440 --> 14:10.240
demeanor would change.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.520
And she said, I would actually praise the Lord that I couldn't engage in those

14:14.520 --> 14:16.960
conversations and that I wasn't sinful for hearing them.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.880
And what she would do is what people said at her funeral, which was really

14:21.880 --> 14:23.720
beautiful to me, it was very comforting to me.

14:23.920 --> 14:28.440
And I took it as a life mission that if you were new to a place or if you were

14:28.440 --> 14:33.280
kind of in the corner and not known to other people in the community and you felt

14:33.280 --> 14:37.040
left out, she was the one that literally would look around the room and she'd see

14:37.040 --> 14:40.600
who was standing in the corner and who was new to the community or new to

14:40.600 --> 14:43.480
whatever place and she'd go and try to include that person in the gathering.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.840
So even when she had impaired speech and impaired hearing with her smile and

14:47.840 --> 14:51.320
with her warmth, she was able to welcome people wherever that was.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.480
And so the amount of people that came to her funeral and the stories that I

14:55.480 --> 15:00.720
continue to hear till this day, 15 years later, after her passing away of people

15:00.720 --> 15:04.200
that said, you know, no one ever treated me the way your mother treated me.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.600
And she connected that to God.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.200
So that was actually part of my faith journey.

15:09.240 --> 15:13.840
When I think of great people, when I think of people of faith, she's the

15:13.840 --> 15:19.120
first person that comes to my mind because despite her challenges, she was

15:19.120 --> 15:24.200
always the greatest person that you would meet, anyone that met her and that

15:24.200 --> 15:28.720
knew her would say, I've never met anyone that kind, that was her reputation.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.760
And she was deeply empathetic.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.480
She would shed tears over people that she had no connection to.

15:34.480 --> 15:38.520
This is again, before social media, before, you know, the heavy exposure

15:38.520 --> 15:40.320
that we have to people in conflict zones.

15:40.920 --> 15:46.240
She had to engage every single human being in her life in a deep and profound

15:46.240 --> 15:49.000
way, because she had a profound connection to God and she believed

15:49.000 --> 15:53.760
that that was her calling and none of her challenges made her bitter.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.720
In fact, they only made her more connected to God and they only made her a

15:58.720 --> 16:01.480
better person until the last breath that she took.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.080
Do you miss her?

16:05.720 --> 16:06.000
Yeah.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.520
I mean, yes, absolutely.

16:09.560 --> 16:13.560
But I, I feel like everything I do is an extension of her.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.840
So you try to carry what she stood for.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.160
Absolutely.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.240
As part of yourself.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.520
The prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that when a person passes away,

16:23.920 --> 16:27.320
there are only three things that continue to benefit them, that continue

16:27.320 --> 16:34.040
to extend them, a continuous charity or a piece of knowledge that continues

16:34.520 --> 16:37.880
to benefit people or a righteous child that prays for them.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.600
And I want to be that child that prays for her, but also does charity

16:42.600 --> 16:46.160
in her name, extends her charity, extends what she taught me by being

16:46.160 --> 16:49.480
the person that she was to everyone around me.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.720
And there are some times where I don't feel like getting out of bed.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.200
Sometimes where I don't feel like doing for myself, but I actually

16:56.200 --> 16:57.240
feel like doing for her.

16:57.880 --> 17:03.080
So everything in my life that I try to do, I try to make it an extension of her.

17:03.560 --> 17:10.720
And, um, that's been my calling and, you know, I believe I'll meet her again.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.840
I believe I'll be with her again.

17:13.720 --> 17:19.480
I believe that everything I do that is good will be of benefit to her.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.960
And I believe that it would make her proud.

17:22.640 --> 17:30.200
And so as much as I miss her, uh, as much as I am fueled to do for her.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.240
And so I continue that and that's kind of become part of my life.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.680
It's been my life story as a child.

17:36.680 --> 17:41.080
And as an adult, it's been sort of the centerpiece of my life, uh, to do

17:42.320 --> 17:48.160
things that extend her and ultimately in the process, hopefully benefit me

17:48.160 --> 17:53.720
because I believe that she's a woman who I pray is destined for paradise.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.480
And I want to do the things that would get me there too.

17:56.400 --> 18:03.480
What did you learn about death, about life from losing her?

18:05.400 --> 18:11.040
Well, I feel like the facade of the material world was made

18:11.040 --> 18:12.800
evident to me at a very young age.

18:12.880 --> 18:18.480
You know, most children grow up and their parents want to

18:18.480 --> 18:19.640
protect them from everything.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.640
And I felt that too, you know, my, my mother wanted to downplay her

18:24.640 --> 18:28.160
own tragedy so that me and my brother could live a fruitful and fulfilling life.

18:28.160 --> 18:35.800
My father wanted to protect us from the hardship of her life so

18:35.800 --> 18:37.200
that we could live fulfilling lives.

18:37.200 --> 18:41.240
He was, he'd often be the only father on a field trip, even though

18:41.240 --> 18:42.720
he was a distinguished professor.

18:42.760 --> 18:43.880
I mean, he was a busy man.

18:44.600 --> 18:48.720
He was a very busy man, but he tried to show up at a field trip and tried

18:48.720 --> 18:50.960
to make our lives as normal as possible.

18:51.960 --> 18:57.400
But in the process, we always understood that there was more to life than what

18:57.400 --> 18:58.840
other children were seeing it as.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.120
And now I know that as an adult, there's more to life than what other adults see

19:02.120 --> 19:07.280
it as the material world disappointed early on so that we could see beyond it.

19:07.360 --> 19:13.000
And I often tell people that, you know, there are many that grow up in tragedy,

19:13.040 --> 19:20.400
orphan children, refugees that grow up and do incredible things

19:20.400 --> 19:26.120
because they immediately see past the facade.

19:26.680 --> 19:31.760
They see through all of the material promises of this world, the deception

19:31.760 --> 19:36.440
of it, and that you can choose to be bitter as a result of that, or you

19:36.440 --> 19:39.560
can choose to be better.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.800
And I think that for me, I had to consciously make that decision that I

19:44.800 --> 19:47.280
was going to live a life of prayer.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.960
I was going to live a life of charity.

19:48.960 --> 19:55.680
I was going to live a life of commitment and in that process, invest in

19:55.680 --> 19:59.600
something that's greater, invest in something that doesn't disappoint.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.800
And so I believe in God.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.360
I believe in the hereafter.

20:04.040 --> 20:10.080
And I believe that God will not let any trial or effort in this life go to

20:10.080 --> 20:12.120
waste without it being repaid in the hereafter.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.320
And so I worked towards that.

20:13.320 --> 20:18.800
And so life and death, I understood existence to be transcendent early on.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.600
That if I believe that there was nothing to life except for life, I would be a

20:23.600 --> 20:29.240
very bitter person, but because I know that there is more to it than this, I'm

20:29.240 --> 20:34.880
able to exist in it without being depressed by it.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.040
Existence is transcendence.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.480
What happens after we die?

20:45.480 --> 20:54.400
After the material instantiation fades away.

20:55.800 --> 21:03.520
So the Quran tells us that God brought us from the darkness of the womb into this

21:03.520 --> 21:08.840
life, you were nothing but a dirty drop of fluid and you became this fully

21:09.080 --> 21:11.800
proportioned human being from the darkness of the womb.

21:11.800 --> 21:12.880
You come into this life.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.880
You experience it and then you go to the darkness of the grave only to be

21:17.880 --> 21:27.320
resurrected once again and that we are souls with bodies, not bodies with souls.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.560
And there's a huge difference between those two things.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.400
This is the vehicle that contains us here.

21:33.120 --> 21:40.480
This is the material world that we encounter here, but we are not this.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.880
And this is not our entire existence.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.240
And so the soul continues.

21:45.640 --> 21:53.440
This is a life in which we seek to worship him and seek to live in

21:53.440 --> 21:56.320
accordance with the purpose that he has set out for us.

21:57.280 --> 22:04.520
And after we pass away, our soul continues onwards, either to reward or

22:04.520 --> 22:09.440
to punishment or to a mixture of both, but it's a, it's a realm of

22:09.440 --> 22:17.560
accountability and hopefully it's a realm of reward should we exist in

22:17.560 --> 22:18.920
a way that he wants us to exist.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.280
So you said that you can look to God for wisdom to make sense of the world.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.440
There's a lot of stuff to us humans.

22:29.560 --> 22:31.160
That's difficult to make sense of.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.600
Like you losing your mother.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.520
There's a lot of cruelty in the world.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.600
There's a lot of suffering in the world.

22:40.360 --> 22:48.560
Uh, what wisdom, uh, have you been able to find, uh, from God about, about

22:48.560 --> 22:51.120
why there is suffering in the world, why there's cruelty?

22:51.600 --> 22:54.200
You know, there's a saying that I wanted to ask God about why he

22:54.200 --> 22:57.680
allows hunger and war and poverty.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
But I was afraid he might ask me the same question.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.920
God has certainly given us enough food.

23:03.960 --> 23:08.000
There is enough food in the world for everyone to have a 3,200 calorie

23:08.000 --> 23:13.960
diet a day, uh, God has certainly given us enough guidance, uh, for us to

23:13.960 --> 23:20.120
not inflict on each other the cruelty that we inflict when we look to the

23:20.120 --> 23:24.080
world around us, first and foremost, we have to have a sense of accountability.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.880
We are accountable for our own actions.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.520
We don't blame God for the evil of man.

23:29.000 --> 23:29.640
That's one.

23:30.560 --> 23:37.080
But at the same time, we understand that God and his wisdom allows for certain

23:37.080 --> 23:43.560
outcomes that we cannot encompass with our own and that to isolate these

23:43.560 --> 23:50.520
incidents and to try to make sense of them is no different than a baby in

23:50.520 --> 23:54.840
the womb that doesn't understand the world that it's coming into and trying

23:54.840 --> 23:58.120
to explain to that baby that hasn't yet developed its own senses and its

23:58.280 --> 24:02.800
own perception of this world, what is happening to it, right?

24:02.840 --> 24:08.560
You know, I often think of the example of a child and, you know, having, uh,

24:08.920 --> 24:13.720
been at this point now through the experience of parenthood, I'm still

24:13.720 --> 24:19.840
learning, I'm just going into having a teenager, uh, with three kids and

24:19.840 --> 24:24.360
being a softie for my kids, you know, when you have to tell your child that

24:24.360 --> 24:27.480
they can't have something that they really, really want.

24:28.360 --> 24:33.160
And that child thinks you hate them at some point, you know, because why are

24:33.160 --> 24:40.120
you stopping me from putting this toy in my mouth and choking myself?

24:40.720 --> 24:41.960
Uh, they don't get it, right?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.920
But at the same time, you prevent them out of love.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.680
They're not in a position to understand that you're preventing them out of love.

24:49.760 --> 24:55.520
And to isolate these incidents with God and to say the wisdom, what's the wisdom?

24:55.680 --> 24:59.720
Uh, you're trying to make sense of a pixel when you can't see the bigger picture.

25:00.840 --> 25:05.080
Your mind is not at a place where you can make sense of the bigger picture.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.480
You haven't seen the bigger picture.

25:07.400 --> 25:13.560
And so for him to even explain to us every incident, uh, would completely

25:13.560 --> 25:15.960
defeat the purpose of putting your trust in him.

25:16.600 --> 25:22.040
So we believe in a God that is all encompassing in his knowledge and

25:22.040 --> 25:27.400
wisdom that gives us an Islam is very specific by the way that there is what

25:27.400 --> 25:31.000
God tells us to do and there's what God allows to happen.

25:31.840 --> 25:35.200
So what God tells us to do in terms of the roadmap towards good, and then what

25:35.200 --> 25:39.680
God allows to happen in his divine wisdom, that no outcome can escape him.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.320
But at the same time, we are accountable for our own actions and our own deeds.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.800
So when you come to someone and say, you know, why did God allow

25:47.800 --> 25:49.280
this to happen to this person?

25:50.160 --> 25:56.800
I can't rationalize that for you because my understanding is relegated to the

25:56.800 --> 25:58.440
immediate experience in front of me.

25:59.760 --> 26:07.760
But if I know God and if I learn about God, then I don't have to make sense of

26:07.760 --> 26:12.440
the plan, but I can tell you that I trust the planner and I think that

26:12.440 --> 26:13.760
that's where peace is found.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.200
You know, a lot of times you look for the light at the end of the tunnel.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.640
What's the light at the end of the tunnel?

26:19.160 --> 26:24.760
In Islam, there's emphasis on God and the hereafter because to try to make sense

26:24.760 --> 26:32.080
of divine decree and why certain things happen in this world without the existence

26:32.080 --> 26:36.160
of a God or without the existence of a hereafter will always fail you.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.360
So the existence of a God that is all knowing what we don't know.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.880
I know what you don't know that understands what we don't understand.

26:44.400 --> 26:51.720
The existence of a God who is not subject to our constrictions and the existence of

26:51.720 --> 26:58.080
a hereafter where all things find recourse, where there's divine recourse

26:59.480 --> 27:03.960
allows for this world to be situated within the existence of something greater

27:03.960 --> 27:05.480
and not treated in isolation.

27:05.720 --> 27:09.320
So when you're trying to treat an incident of this world in isolation,

27:09.680 --> 27:10.480
you're going to fail.

27:10.520 --> 27:14.720
And when you try to treat existence in this world and of this world in isolation,

27:14.720 --> 27:15.760
you're also going to fail.

27:15.760 --> 27:21.640
And so the emphasis is the belief in God, a God that is not limited like you are

27:22.360 --> 27:26.560
and a belief in the hereafter that is not limited like this life.

27:27.280 --> 27:32.120
And so everything continues onwards and there's divine recourse for everything.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.200
Each and everything, you know, the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon

27:35.200 --> 27:40.680
him mentions that on the day of judgment, a person who lived the most difficult of

27:40.680 --> 27:46.040
lives will be dipped into paradise one time and will be told, have you ever seen

27:46.040 --> 27:47.920
any sadness, any hardship?

27:47.960 --> 27:52.800
Now, when you think about the most difficult life, some of the commentators in

27:52.800 --> 27:58.480
Islam, they said that this is perhaps referring to the Prophet Job, Ayub peace

27:58.480 --> 28:02.800
be upon him, because Job lived obviously a life of great difficulty, but that a

28:02.800 --> 28:06.480
person who lived a very hard life would be dipped into paradise one time.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.120
And just with a dip be asked, have you ever seen any hardship?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.080
Have you ever seen any misery?

28:12.640 --> 28:14.480
And that person would say, what is sadness?

28:14.520 --> 28:15.200
What is hardship?

28:15.240 --> 28:15.880
What is misery?

28:15.920 --> 28:19.600
Now, if you don't believe in the hereafter, if you don't believe in anything

28:19.600 --> 28:23.240
beyond this life, then the recourse has to happen in this life.

28:23.240 --> 28:28.560
And because we see so many people pass through this life without recourse of

28:28.560 --> 28:33.800
cruelty, without recourse of suffering, then we're forced to try to make sense

28:33.800 --> 28:34.080
of it.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.840
And if you are someone who believes that this entire world came into existence

28:38.320 --> 28:45.080
through randomness, that we're just an existence of random atoms that collide

28:45.080 --> 28:48.760
with each other and that all of this comes together out of nothing, then how

28:48.760 --> 28:51.240
can you put your trust in anything that is greater?

28:51.920 --> 28:57.440
So as a, you know, you asked me as a, as a child of, of a parent who suffered, I

28:57.440 --> 29:06.320
believe that every moment that my mother suffered, that she will be rewarded, that

29:06.320 --> 29:11.040
she will be elevated, that all of that made her or contributed to the beautiful

29:11.040 --> 29:16.000
person that she was and will contribute to the beautiful reward that she receives.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.200
And the recourse is certain to me as a believer in that.

29:21.080 --> 29:26.040
So the right approach to making sense of the world, especially making sense of

29:26.040 --> 29:32.360
suffering and cruelty is that of humility that we as humans cannot possibly

29:32.360 --> 29:34.040
understand fully.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.120
Absolutely.

29:35.320 --> 29:39.200
In fact, in the Quran, it's very interesting when God creates Adam, the

29:39.200 --> 29:46.960
angels say to God, are you going to create a race or a species that will spill

29:46.960 --> 29:48.640
blood and cause corruption?

29:49.520 --> 29:53.880
And God says to the angels in response to that question, I know that which you

29:53.880 --> 29:54.400
don't know.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.400
So even the angels have to humble themselves for a moment.

29:57.520 --> 30:02.760
The angels who adore God, who love God, who worship him, who obey him

30:02.760 --> 30:07.560
unconditionally, they are told by God, I know that which you don't know.

30:08.360 --> 30:13.280
And what we extract from that, what many of the early interpretations extract

30:13.280 --> 30:19.000
from that is that God knows that there are human beings that will come out of

30:19.120 --> 30:24.560
this enterprise of humanity that make the entire existence of it worth it.

30:24.800 --> 30:29.840
And so just as, yes, there will be criminals and corrupt ones, there will be

30:29.960 --> 30:34.640
prophets and beautiful people that come out of this and sages and saints that

30:34.640 --> 30:41.600
come out of this that show that a human being who, unlike an angel who has no

30:41.600 --> 30:45.200
choice but to worship God, an angel has no sense of will, no sense of choice.

30:45.240 --> 30:48.840
An angel is created to worship and has no desires.

30:48.880 --> 30:54.320
A human being who has the choice of desire and worship, the choice of righteousness

30:54.320 --> 30:57.160
and wickedness, that there are human beings who will choose worship and

30:57.160 --> 31:03.400
righteousness, that will choose charity over cruelty, that will choose service

31:03.560 --> 31:09.160
and choose dedication and devotion over death and destruction, that there are

31:09.200 --> 31:14.280
human beings that will in fact ascend the angels in rank because they will live

31:14.280 --> 31:20.160
lives where they choose that capacity, that part of themselves, and they lean

31:20.160 --> 31:23.800
into that and worship God lovingly and obey him.

31:24.160 --> 31:27.960
You see, some of the sages in Islam, scholars, they describe this as saying

31:27.960 --> 31:33.560
that the human being has the capacity to be anywhere from an animal to an angel,

31:34.080 --> 31:37.960
or even worse, to be a devil, you know, to an angel, not in the sense that we

31:37.960 --> 31:43.680
ever actually become angels or become animals, but that an animal, you know,

31:43.880 --> 31:48.040
for the most part, seeks its desires over everything, doesn't really think

31:48.040 --> 31:52.080
about, you know, many of the things that we are supposed to calculate as human

31:52.080 --> 31:56.720
beings, doesn't think about which territory it's infringing upon or, you

31:56.720 --> 31:59.200
know, how much of its appetite it should fulfill.

31:59.240 --> 32:03.200
It simply exists to fulfill its appetite and that many human beings simply

32:03.200 --> 32:06.760
exist to fulfill their appetite and they choose that over worship or reason

32:06.760 --> 32:07.840
or anything that is greater.

32:07.840 --> 32:12.840
Just they, they literally take their selves as gods in that sense and their

32:13.280 --> 32:16.120
selves have no limitation on appetite.

32:16.120 --> 32:18.960
So they just keep filling that appetite and filling that appetite and filling

32:18.960 --> 32:24.160
that appetite, whereas a human being can also go to the extent of choosing

32:24.160 --> 32:29.680
something greater and disciplining their desires, disciplining their selves

32:29.760 --> 32:31.360
because they're seeking a greater reward.

32:31.480 --> 32:35.040
You know, we know many people that achieve great things in the worldly

32:35.040 --> 32:38.760
sense because they choose to study over sleep.

32:38.760 --> 32:44.360
For example, they choose to exert themselves towards their careers, towards

32:44.360 --> 32:48.560
their education, because they believe that ultimately the outcome of those

32:48.560 --> 32:52.720
pursuits are more rewarding than the immediate fulfillment of their desires.

32:53.240 --> 32:58.280
So as believers, we choose that love of God and we choose that outcome that we

32:58.280 --> 33:03.600
seek and we discipline ourselves to where we can even ascend past the angels in rank.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.000
Now, of course, I said, we can go as low as an animal or as low as a devil.

33:07.760 --> 33:13.960
And we have tyrants, past and present and future as well that can become

33:13.960 --> 33:20.040
satanic in their nature because they allow their desires to take such control

33:20.040 --> 33:26.080
over them that they not only worship them, but that every other existing being

33:26.120 --> 33:32.600
around them simply becomes a piece of their own puzzle in pursuit of their

33:32.600 --> 33:34.920
own lordship and their own satisfaction.

33:34.920 --> 33:39.080
They will kill, they will discard not because, you know, and I always say this,

33:39.080 --> 33:44.880
it's not that tyrants necessarily like killing people, it's that people's

33:44.880 --> 33:49.400
lives pose somewhat of an, you know, an indifference to them.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.240
They're indifferent to people's existence.

33:51.240 --> 33:57.120
And so you become either an object for or against me.

33:57.200 --> 34:02.040
And so they're willing to discard children, discard people,

34:02.400 --> 34:07.960
discard the rights of others because they ultimately have chosen that the

34:07.960 --> 34:15.280
greatest pursuit of themselves is the maximum position of power and a place

34:15.280 --> 34:20.040
to where they can fulfill what they want to of themselves without any limits.

34:20.280 --> 34:24.520
And every, everyone else becomes either a threat or an opportunity in that regard.

34:24.880 --> 34:28.520
So we can be devils, we can be angelic-like, we could be animals.

34:29.160 --> 34:30.520
We're somewhere on that spectrum.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.280
And every moment contains a set of choices you can make.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.240
Absolutely.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.720
Every single moment contains a set of choices.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.080
And that's where the intentionality comes in.

34:40.520 --> 34:40.800
Right?

34:40.800 --> 34:46.120
So the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says that I saw a person strolling

34:46.120 --> 34:48.720
in paradise because he removed something harmful from the road.

34:49.800 --> 34:56.920
He tells us about a woman that lived a life in prostitution, but that repented

34:57.080 --> 35:01.880
to God when she was thirsty one day and she saw a dog that was also thirsty.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.440
And she said that I was thirsty and God gave me water.

35:04.440 --> 35:06.960
So I'm going to choose to give water to that thirsty dog.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.400
And God enters her into paradise as a result of that.

35:10.160 --> 35:16.400
Sometimes the small moments with a small, sincere deed can have a huge

35:16.400 --> 35:18.520
impact on a person's trajectory.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.160
So every moment is a moment of choices.

35:21.560 --> 35:29.560
And when we choose belief, righteousness, a pursuit of something greater, then we

35:29.560 --> 35:38.240
find ways to turn things that are otherwise mundane into miraculous acts, right?

35:38.280 --> 35:43.440
Where we can, we can choose God over ourselves and in the process, choose

35:43.440 --> 35:44.880
a better fate for ourselves.

35:45.480 --> 35:50.640
How difficult is the process of knowing, understanding what is the righteous

35:50.640 --> 35:58.400
action of knowing what it means to be a good man or a good woman?

35:59.160 --> 36:00.800
Well, the truth has consequences.

36:01.200 --> 36:05.880
So don't seek out the truth unless you're willing to abide by what you find.

36:06.640 --> 36:12.560
So a lot of people want to mold their journey in accordance with a predetermined

36:12.560 --> 36:13.760
pursuit that they already have.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.760
And so when they approach religion, they approach it like another product.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.840
You know, there was a, uh, an article that was actually written by a rabbi.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.520
I've spoken about this in several sermons.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.240
It was called the allure of narcissistic spirituality, the allure of

36:26.240 --> 36:30.400
narcissistic spirituality, where he talks about, you know, how religion becomes

36:30.400 --> 36:36.040
just another product of your own self adoration and worship to where you only

36:36.040 --> 36:43.040
approach religion to the extent that it gives you more happiness in the worldly

36:43.040 --> 36:45.200
sense, you only approach of it.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.680
What is therapeutic.

36:46.760 --> 36:54.080
So it becomes just as secular in its nature as any other practice of meditation

36:54.080 --> 36:55.920
or whatever it may be, or some other product.

36:55.920 --> 37:00.320
And he kind of mentions, you know, how, uh, he, he took that from a person that

37:00.720 --> 37:05.480
is praying in a temple and a guy walks into the temple and bumps into him and

37:05.480 --> 37:06.680
then he curses the guy out.

37:07.200 --> 37:13.920
So he didn't see his behavior towards that person as, uh, part of his trajectory

37:13.920 --> 37:19.480
of worship, he just saw his being godly as the worship that he was engaged in.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.600
The truth has consequences.

37:22.600 --> 37:27.800
The truth has circumstances that are required of you, actions that are

37:27.800 --> 37:30.800
required of you that may be somewhat inconvenient.

37:30.840 --> 37:34.920
So you have to be willing to engage in a sincere pursuit of truth and look for

37:34.920 --> 37:38.840
truth for what it is and not simply look for comfort and convenience.

37:39.560 --> 37:46.120
And when you engage in that journey of wanting to know, you have to engage

37:46.120 --> 37:51.600
it thoroughly and sincerely and try your best to remove any bias.

37:51.640 --> 37:55.160
I think that's what makes the, the religion of Islam, such a phenomenon

37:55.160 --> 37:59.440
for people that with all the Islamophobia and the bigotry towards it,

37:59.440 --> 38:02.200
it's still the fastest growing religion in the United States and the fastest

38:02.200 --> 38:03.160
growing religion in the world.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.400
And no, that's not all birth rate.

38:04.520 --> 38:10.880
Yeah, we have a lot of kids, but, um, many people, you know, you, you met someone,

38:11.160 --> 38:14.720
uh, just before we started this interview, many people, in fact, in a post 9 11

38:14.720 --> 38:21.480
world saw what they saw of Islam in the media and they actually, uh, you know,

38:21.480 --> 38:24.920
went and checked out copies of the Quran and started to read about the religion.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.800
And in their sincere pursuit of truth ended up embracing a religion that they

38:29.840 --> 38:32.320
believed was the greatest source of destruction in the world.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.000
And now it's the greatest source of peace for them.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.000
And their own existence in their own lives.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.960
And so you have to be willing to engage in a sincere pursuit of wanting to

38:41.960 --> 38:47.600
know, and then be willing to engage in sincere commitment after, you know,

38:47.840 --> 38:49.680
otherwise the heart rusts.

38:49.840 --> 38:53.240
And so there's a process in the Quran talks about this of making the heart

38:53.600 --> 38:56.040
like fertile soil towards truth.

38:56.520 --> 39:00.880
So you have a sincere pursuit, but then at some point, if you come to know, and

39:00.880 --> 39:04.840
then you ignore what you come to know, then the heart rusts and it becomes

39:04.840 --> 39:07.800
harder to recognize it the second time around and the third time around.

39:07.800 --> 39:12.520
And so when people come to me and they say, you know, I'm looking for something,

39:12.560 --> 39:16.440
I'm looking for, I'm looking for God, I'm looking for my purpose.

39:16.800 --> 39:21.520
The first thing I tell them, as I say, listen, what you need to do is if you're

39:21.520 --> 39:24.680
really looking for God and you're, and you believe in God, and there are often

39:24.720 --> 39:28.480
people that say, I believe in God, but I don't know where to go with this, right?

39:28.480 --> 39:30.040
I know that there's something greater.

39:30.040 --> 39:34.880
And in Islam, we call that the fitra, a natural disposition towards the belief

39:34.880 --> 39:36.000
in the existence of God.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.440
Um, but where do I go from here?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.720
You know, what do I do now?

39:39.760 --> 39:45.240
And I say, the first thing you need to do is you need to sincerely say, Oh,

39:45.240 --> 39:49.720
God guide me to the truth, call upon God, sincerely say, I'm calling upon you

39:49.720 --> 39:52.880
alone and I'm asking you to guide me to the truth, show me what it is.

39:53.240 --> 39:53.560
Right.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.000
And that's the heart function.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.760
Then you need to actually investigate and try to suspend bias, right?

40:01.760 --> 40:07.120
Investigate the world's religions, investigate the claims to truth, uh,

40:07.200 --> 40:12.880
investigate, uh, use, you know, rational inquiry to the extent that the heart

40:12.880 --> 40:19.320
becomes satisfied and suspend bias and you'll be surprised.

40:19.440 --> 40:23.440
And so for a lot of people and they come to me and they say, you know, this,

40:23.520 --> 40:28.160
this, this about Islam, I'm like, look, I'm, if you're just going to talk to me

40:28.160 --> 40:31.360
about what you've seen of Islam in the media, if you were serious about it, you

40:31.360 --> 40:35.760
know, if you're serious about it, then, uh, you're not simply going to be

40:35.760 --> 40:43.720
satisfied with the highly edited images and distorted facts that come towards

40:43.720 --> 40:46.760
you about this religion, right?

40:47.960 --> 40:48.960
What are you looking for?

40:49.080 --> 40:49.360
Right.

40:49.360 --> 40:51.840
Are you, are you looking for a scapegoat?

40:52.000 --> 40:55.640
Uh, Islam poses a threat to many people, right?

40:55.640 --> 40:56.920
Are you looking for a scapegoat?

40:56.920 --> 40:59.720
Are you looking for the big, bad, scary foreign enemy?

41:00.640 --> 41:05.520
Or are you looking at a religion that one fourth of the world adheres to?

41:06.640 --> 41:10.080
And if one fourth of us were bad, uh, the world would not exist.

41:10.560 --> 41:10.920
Right.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.240
So are you looking towards this religion that one fourth of the world adheres to?

41:14.280 --> 41:16.640
Are you going to read about the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.440
Are you going to read the Quran yourself?

41:18.440 --> 41:21.200
Are you going to investigate for yourself?

41:21.680 --> 41:26.480
Uh, what it is that this faith has to offer and find in it, uh, a great sense

41:26.480 --> 41:30.400
of, of, of wisdom, a great sense of beauty, a great sense of truth.

41:31.600 --> 41:35.000
And I think that for, for a lot of people, you know, they, they find

41:35.000 --> 41:39.280
that Islam has such a beautiful combination of the intellectual

41:39.280 --> 41:44.040
proofs, as well as the spiritual experiences that often combine, uh,

41:44.040 --> 41:46.600
what people seek in the Western and the Eastern religion.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.600
So I had an interesting two weeks, uh, two weeks in a row.

41:51.440 --> 41:55.880
Um, this was August, two weeks in a row, I had someone who converted to Islam

41:56.560 --> 42:00.600
that went from being, uh, that started off as a Methodist, went from being

42:00.600 --> 42:02.400
a Methodist to being a Buddhist, to being a Muslim.

42:03.560 --> 42:06.160
So two weeks in a row, I had a Methodist turned Buddhist turned Muslim.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.040
Great journey.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.080
I call, yeah, I called my, my Methodist, uh, friends.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.200
I have a lot of Methodist pastors in the city that I work with.

42:13.200 --> 42:16.120
And I said, what's going on here, man, sending people onto this

42:16.120 --> 42:18.160
interesting journey of Buddhism and then Islam.

42:18.800 --> 42:22.600
But both of them had a very similar story, which is that they had sought

42:22.600 --> 42:26.520
in Buddhism, for example, the, you know, some of the meditative

42:26.520 --> 42:30.360
practices that are found that, that really Western religion, which has

42:30.360 --> 42:35.240
been dominated by capitalism and dominated by, by very material things

42:35.240 --> 42:37.600
and, uh, can be very unfulfilling.

42:37.600 --> 42:40.160
They found that in some of the Eastern philosophies and the meditative

42:40.160 --> 42:44.360
practices, and then they came to Islam and it combines, you know, their,

42:44.400 --> 42:50.160
their belief in sort of the Abrahamic way, it merged their belief in one

42:50.160 --> 42:55.280
God and the prophets like Abraham and Moses and Jesus, peace be upon them

42:55.280 --> 43:01.840
all, with a deep tradition of meditative practices, of consciousness, of

43:01.840 --> 43:03.680
connection to God on a regular basis.

43:03.680 --> 43:07.080
And they found that to be very fulfilling, both intellectually and

43:07.080 --> 43:10.440
spiritually, and so I was like, that's interesting, you know, two people in

43:10.440 --> 43:12.000
two weeks that went through that journey.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.920
So I think Islam is very wholesome, comprehensive when people actually

43:16.920 --> 43:23.120
approach it with humility and, uh, and, and appreciate what it has to offer.

43:24.880 --> 43:31.000
As you mentioned, uh, in the minds of some Americans, uh, after 9 11, the

43:31.040 --> 43:37.320
religion of Islam was associated with maybe you could say evil in the world.

43:37.880 --> 43:40.320
Maybe you can say, uh, terrorism.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.440
Uh, how can you respond to this association?

43:43.560 --> 43:44.720
Uh, how does it make you feel?

43:44.720 --> 43:50.000
First of all, as a, as a devout Muslim yourself and, um, how can you overcome

43:50.000 --> 43:54.320
it personally, how can you overcome it as a community and as a religious leader?

43:55.520 --> 44:00.600
It's interesting because 9 11 now we're talking over 21 years ago.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.840
You know, there's people born after 9 11.

44:03.840 --> 44:05.720
It's crazy to talk to them all the time.

44:06.400 --> 44:06.680
Yeah.

44:06.680 --> 44:10.080
So when I'm talking to young Muslims, I'm talking about post 9 11,

44:10.080 --> 44:13.240
post 9 11, they're like, I didn't, I was born in 2005.

44:13.240 --> 44:14.720
What are you talking about post 9 11?

44:14.720 --> 44:17.040
I'm like, well, I remember being a teenager.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.720
I remember being in high school and this happened, right?

44:18.720 --> 44:23.040
So a lot of us that experienced 9 11 as high schoolers or as college students

44:23.040 --> 44:27.760
and remember distinctly what it was like to be a Muslim pre 9 11 and post 9 11.

44:28.280 --> 44:32.440
Uh, we can relate to that experience and we could, we could identify that

44:32.440 --> 44:37.560
juncture, you know, very clearly and talk about it and speak to the change

44:37.560 --> 44:41.160
in the perceptions of Islam that happened here in the United States

44:41.160 --> 44:42.000
and around the world.

44:42.360 --> 44:46.080
But a lot of young people are born into that reality and are

44:46.080 --> 44:49.520
experiencing the aftermath of it.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.960
And, um, you know, unfortunately I have to deal with the bigotry that

44:53.960 --> 45:01.160
has, uh, not just, you know, taken greater shape in media constructions

45:01.160 --> 45:04.000
of Islam, but also policies, right?

45:04.000 --> 45:07.880
A lot of the civil liberties of the Muslim community, uh, were taken away

45:07.880 --> 45:11.320
from us, you read about the Patriot act, you read about the securitization

45:11.840 --> 45:15.360
of the Muslim community and some of the unfair practices that have been

45:15.360 --> 45:18.280
engaged by the Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump

45:18.280 --> 45:22.120
administration, and continue into the Biden administration, uh,

45:22.240 --> 45:23.720
international Islamophobia.

45:23.800 --> 45:32.320
And so the hatred of Muslims and the bigotry that is wielded against Muslims

45:32.320 --> 45:38.520
on the basis of this idea that we are a barbaric people, not ascribed to a

45:38.520 --> 45:46.360
religion of hate and violence, um, has had immediate consequences for us.

45:46.400 --> 45:50.880
No matter where we are in terms of our age and, uh, in terms of our experience,

45:50.880 --> 45:52.960
we, we, we have dealt with that in different ways.

45:52.960 --> 45:59.960
Now the association of Islam to terrorism is a lazy association.

46:00.920 --> 46:08.200
It's one that ignores both the history of violence as well as its everyday occurrence.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.440
You know, we're good for how many mass shootings a year?

46:12.160 --> 46:14.600
When's the last time you heard of a Muslim carrying out a mass

46:14.600 --> 46:16.320
shooting in America, right?

46:16.320 --> 46:20.480
How many of those mass shootings, if you were to scrub the social media, what,

46:20.480 --> 46:25.000
400, 500 mass shootings a year, if you were to scrub the social media of some of

46:25.000 --> 46:28.080
those that carried out those shootings, you know, we're good for one or two

46:28.080 --> 46:29.040
idiots a year, right?

46:29.280 --> 46:34.120
It's unfortunate that you're going to have people that, uh, that carry out

46:34.160 --> 46:40.240
despicable acts of violence, but when we as Muslims hear someone in the media say

46:40.760 --> 46:45.520
terrorism has been ruled out as a possibility while the blood is still on

46:45.520 --> 46:49.560
the floor of that Walmart, we already know that the police chief just said

46:49.560 --> 46:50.640
that that wasn't a Muslim.

46:50.840 --> 46:51.360
Don't worry.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.120
You know, that wasn't an Al Qaeda guy or an ISIS guy.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.080
Um, it was, it was one of our own, right?

46:57.080 --> 47:03.600
And so it's, it's become frankly ridiculous because the association of

47:03.680 --> 47:12.080
violence with Islam, uh, is one that is used to actually, uh, carry out acts of

47:12.080 --> 47:14.040
violence against Muslims worldwide.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.920
It justifies bad policy towards Muslims worldwide.

47:17.400 --> 47:21.240
And then in the United States, and it's just factually so lazy.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.760
Um, there was a study just about how the media gives more attention to acts of

47:25.760 --> 47:31.440
violence done by Muslims and immediately, uh, stamps it with Islam, uh, up

47:31.440 --> 47:35.560
to 300% more than it will with another act of violence carried out in the

47:35.560 --> 47:36.640
name of anything else.

47:36.720 --> 47:40.680
So you don't hear about the acts of violence that are carried out by others.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.960
You don't hear about the religion of the perpetrators.

47:45.040 --> 47:48.960
You don't associate terrorism with actions, frankly, of state terrorism.

47:49.320 --> 47:56.240
You know, when governments launch chemical attacks or drone weddings and do

47:56.240 --> 48:02.880
so while explicitly dehumanizing the people, just because they do so with the

48:02.880 --> 48:08.080
government apparatus doesn't make it any less terroristic than if it's a lone

48:08.080 --> 48:11.720
person that goes out and commits an act of violence, trying to achieve a political

48:11.720 --> 48:12.040
goal.

48:13.240 --> 48:17.280
So the association is lazy, historically speaking, the crusades.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.480
I grew up in Louisiana.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.280
I saw clan rallies, Ku Klux Klan rallies, my whole life.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.920
And people said, well, that's a thing of the past.

48:22.920 --> 48:23.800
Well, guess what?

48:23.960 --> 48:30.760
You know, we see many semblances, many acts that are carried out with the

48:30.760 --> 48:34.360
same vitriol that was generated by the Ku Klux Klan.

48:35.720 --> 48:40.360
We have people standing in front of our mosques that belong to right wing hate

48:40.360 --> 48:45.760
militias carrying, uh, AR-15s talking about wanting to inflict harm on Muslims.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
I have been to Christchurch, New Zealand, and buried the victims of a white

48:52.000 --> 48:56.200
supremacist terrorist who was inspired by the political rhetoric here in the United

48:56.200 --> 49:01.280
States, in his own words, in his manifesto to go and kill 50 innocent people in

49:01.280 --> 49:03.800
Christchurch, New Zealand, one of the most peaceful cities in the world.

49:04.480 --> 49:07.440
And by the way, Lex, I mean, it's, it's really interesting, like with Christchurch,

49:08.480 --> 49:14.640
you know, the man wanted, and I won't even say his name, but his next target

49:14.640 --> 49:18.240
after the two mosques had he not been stopped was to go to a Muslim daycare.

49:18.800 --> 49:24.080
So what drives someone to dehumanize people to that extent that he was willing

49:24.080 --> 49:28.800
to go to a daycare and murder a bunch of kids because he saw them as a demographic

49:28.800 --> 49:30.000
threat to civilization.

49:30.600 --> 49:37.600
So Muslims are terrorized because they are falsely depicted as terrorists.

49:38.120 --> 49:42.720
Muslims suffer domestically and globally because of this false association.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.000
It's a lazy association.

49:44.720 --> 49:49.360
And when someone comes around and says, well, fine, not all Muslims are terrorists,

49:49.360 --> 49:50.800
but all terrorists are Muslims.

49:50.880 --> 49:54.320
I say that you clearly don't read statistics.

49:55.120 --> 50:00.200
Whether we're talking about the 20th century, and I'm a student of history,

50:00.200 --> 50:05.160
and I believe you are as well, all the isms, World War I, World War II had

50:05.160 --> 50:06.240
nothing to do with religion.

50:06.240 --> 50:11.200
Certainly had nothing to do with Islam, fascism, Soviet atheism, right?

50:11.200 --> 50:15.920
Many of these systems where people were murdered in the millions,

50:16.040 --> 50:22.080
Nazism, the Holocaust, Rwanda, Cambodia, I can go on and on, the Rohingya today,

50:22.320 --> 50:24.360
the greatest atrocity towards the Uyghurs.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.480
Where does Islam fit in all of this?

50:26.680 --> 50:28.040
People do horrible things.

50:28.760 --> 50:33.400
They stamp it with religion at times, but the only group of people that seem to

50:33.400 --> 50:38.880
suffer after an act of violence is committed are Muslims because any act of

50:38.880 --> 50:44.200
violence that is committed by a Muslim will immediately be blamed on Islam and

50:44.560 --> 50:50.280
2 billion people will have to carry the burden of the act of a single perpetrator.

50:51.360 --> 50:57.080
And just to reiterate, in case the numbers are not known, you mentioned Christ

50:57.080 --> 51:03.040
church, those are two mosque shootings with 51 people killed and 48 were

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
injured in New Zealand.

51:04.680 --> 51:04.960
Yeah.

51:05.960 --> 51:13.040
So it's, uh, it's hate manifesting itself and, and then, uh, actual

51:13.040 --> 51:14.560
human suffering and destruction.

51:16.400 --> 51:16.960
Absolutely.

51:17.560 --> 51:24.040
Is there similarities between, uh, anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate?

51:24.760 --> 51:31.240
So is there something deeper to say about hate in general here that is beyond just

51:31.360 --> 51:33.600
particularly hate towards Muslims?

51:33.960 --> 51:34.480
Absolutely.

51:34.720 --> 51:40.000
Look, um, in Pittsburgh, the synagogue shooting, the perpetrator particularly

51:40.000 --> 51:45.720
target targeted that synagogue because tree of life synagogue, tree of life

51:45.720 --> 51:53.360
synagogue, 11 killed, six wounded in 2018 because he believed that they were taking

51:53.360 --> 51:56.640
in Syrian refugees or supporting Syrian Muslim refugees.

51:57.320 --> 52:02.760
You think about that, the San Diego synagogue shooting that took place

52:02.840 --> 52:06.080
shortly after, uh, he went to a mosque and then he went to a synagogue.

52:07.080 --> 52:16.680
Um, look, the idea of scapegoating minority populations and attributing to

52:16.680 --> 52:22.040
them a disproportionate sense of power and an nefarious element where they

52:22.040 --> 52:28.600
can't be trusted and unless we wipe them out, then they're going to wipe us out.

52:29.480 --> 52:32.120
Uh, underlies many of the bigotries that exist.

52:32.120 --> 52:37.080
I mean, look, um, after Trump announced his Muslim ban, there was a shooting in

52:37.080 --> 52:41.880
Canada, an attack in Canada on a mosque in Quebec where six people were killed.

52:43.080 --> 52:48.240
The shooter explicitly said that the reason why he went to that mosque in

52:48.240 --> 52:53.720
Quebec and shot dead six Muslim worshipers was because he was afraid that

52:53.720 --> 52:57.720
because of the ban on Syrian refugees in the United States, they would come to

52:57.720 --> 53:00.400
Canada and he didn't want them to feel welcomed in Canada.

53:00.800 --> 53:05.920
So, so there is a connection and I think it's when you are able to dehumanize

53:05.920 --> 53:12.800
large groups of people and attribute an nefarious element to them, then

53:12.840 --> 53:16.800
unfortunately in a world that's becoming more and more polarized, where people

53:17.200 --> 53:22.840
are able to construct their entire worldviews based on an algorithm that

53:23.840 --> 53:31.000
that their social media, uh, caters to, you're going to have some of these

53:31.320 --> 53:36.000
attacks happen and there's going to be an unfortunate connection between them.

53:37.480 --> 53:41.120
So what I, what I tell people is that, you know, I think with all of these

53:41.120 --> 53:44.200
people that shoot up synagogues and shoot up mosques and even before that,

53:44.200 --> 53:50.400
actually the, uh, Charleston, uh, South Carolina, uh, shooting at an AME church,

53:51.160 --> 53:57.560
you know, when he went there, uh, he actually said that before he murdered

53:57.680 --> 54:03.600
nine worshipers in that church, he was taken aback by how nice they were to him.

54:03.600 --> 54:08.360
He sat there for two hours before he turned a gun on many people who were

54:08.360 --> 54:11.640
over the age of 80 years old and murdered them in cold blood.

54:12.920 --> 54:16.440
So this is what I talk about when I say that as human beings, we have the

54:16.560 --> 54:22.680
propensity, unfortunately, uh, to become worse than devils, or we can choose to

54:22.680 --> 54:28.360
be angelic when we choose worship and righteousness over ourselves.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.400
So that's a spiritual crisis as well.

54:31.680 --> 54:38.400
Um, and a crisis of meaning and emptiness where I think people are willing to

54:38.400 --> 54:41.760
inflict great pain on others when they can't make sense of their pain in their

54:41.760 --> 54:42.200
own lives.

54:42.200 --> 54:49.520
I'd like to try to figure out together with you sort of, um, a way out to try

54:49.520 --> 54:54.520
to decrease the amount of hate in the world, but, uh, maybe it's useful to talk

54:54.520 --> 54:59.840
about the BBC documentary that, um, it's kind of interesting that people should

54:59.840 --> 55:04.800
check out it's called United States of hate Muslims under attack and you, um,

55:04.840 --> 55:08.160
you appear in that you have conversations with people who are, um,

55:08.200 --> 55:13.240
anti-Muslim and it's, I believe most of it takes place here in Dallas.

55:13.640 --> 55:13.960
Yeah.

55:14.280 --> 55:17.960
And can you just tell me about this, uh, little documentary about that time?

55:17.960 --> 55:19.560
What it was like to interact?

55:19.800 --> 55:22.800
What was the group in the documentary and what was it like to interact with them?

55:23.120 --> 55:29.480
You know, in the very beginning of, um, the rise of at that time, actually, Ted

55:29.480 --> 55:34.520
Cruz, Donald Trump, like when, when Islamophobia, uh, you know, the, the

55:34.560 --> 55:47.280
presidential candidates campaigns at the time, this must've been 2015, 2015,

55:48.680 --> 55:53.960
um, the mayor of Irving at the time, Beth Van Dyne, who is now a Congresswoman,

55:54.600 --> 56:01.720
um, had put out the idea that Muslims were operating a Sharia court in Irving,

56:01.720 --> 56:07.920
Texas, and suddenly there was a hysteria because again, there's the idea that

56:07.920 --> 56:13.120
Muslims are here to dominate Muslims are here to overthrow everything that you

56:13.120 --> 56:18.920
have, um, in the United States, there was hysteria here and it was unfortunate

56:18.920 --> 56:24.120
because, um, what it unleashed, you know, especially with the national discourse

56:24.120 --> 56:27.040
at the time, again, the presidential campaign, you know, Donald Trump says,

56:27.040 --> 56:31.520
I think Islam hates us when he uses those words, I think Islam hates us.

56:32.360 --> 56:35.160
When Ted Cruz suggests that Muslim neighborhoods could be

56:35.160 --> 56:36.880
patrolled or should be patrolled.

56:37.760 --> 56:43.120
And then you have the Irving mayor saying that one of the most populated cities

56:43.200 --> 56:48.800
with Muslims in America, they're operating under an alternative legal,

56:48.840 --> 56:50.000
an alternate legal system.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.480
And funny enough, the year before that she'd come to the mosque and she

56:54.480 --> 56:56.280
praised the diversity of Irving.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.840
And she was talking about how welcome she felt in the mosque.

56:58.840 --> 57:03.000
And the next thing we know, you have these crazy white supremacist groups,

57:03.080 --> 57:07.920
openly white supremacists that affiliate themselves with the clan and others

57:08.720 --> 57:14.760
protesting regularly in front of our mosques with their AR-15s and, um, telling

57:14.760 --> 57:15.840
people to go back home.

57:15.840 --> 57:17.480
And I'm like, I'm from New Orleans.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.080
I'm not planning to move back to New Orleans.

57:19.080 --> 57:19.720
I'm home.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.720
We're, we're, we're home.

57:20.720 --> 57:21.200
We're good.

57:21.240 --> 57:24.800
You know, we're, we're staying put and we refuse to be intimidated.

57:25.560 --> 57:31.160
Um, but then when the Syrian refugee crisis is unfolding as well, Dallas has

57:31.480 --> 57:35.640
been one of the more popular destinations, if you will, I'm not talking about it

57:35.640 --> 57:39.160
like a vacation destination, but where a lot of refugees have come to just because

57:39.160 --> 57:43.000
of the infrastructure that we have set up here, uh, to receive refugees.

57:43.720 --> 57:50.400
And so that hysteria, uh, was an unfortunate, perfect combustion of the

57:50.400 --> 57:55.040
national discourse with the local discourse with the incoming, uh, refugees.

57:55.760 --> 58:01.400
And we would do all sorts of welcome refugee events and we do that, you know,

58:01.400 --> 58:04.960
and we don't only do that for Muslim refugees, by the way, there are refugees

58:04.960 --> 58:06.320
from other parts of the world as well.

58:07.120 --> 58:10.920
Um, but we would host events at our mosques, you know, to welcome refugees,

58:10.920 --> 58:14.640
to help integrate them into the community, to, uh, do things for them.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.520
So you have these armed protests happening, right?

58:16.600 --> 58:23.800
And it's horrible because I think about the trauma to the children that are

58:23.800 --> 58:27.040
hearing about tree of life and hearing about some of these other incidents that

58:27.040 --> 58:29.400
are unfolding and really one of the first communities that was targeted was

58:29.400 --> 58:30.720
the Sikh community in Madison.

58:31.360 --> 58:35.000
Uh, that was one of the first shootings and then the AME church Charleston.

58:35.960 --> 58:39.280
And then you just had tons of places of worship being targeted, right?

58:39.280 --> 58:41.280
So they're seeing this unfold and then they're seeing these

58:41.280 --> 58:42.480
guns in front of their mosques.

58:42.480 --> 58:47.160
And the result to many as well, I just don't want to get shot.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.200
I don't want to go to the mosque.

58:48.200 --> 58:49.520
I don't want to have this happen to me.

58:50.720 --> 58:54.320
So, you know, when BBC reached out and said, we want to do a documentary about

58:54.320 --> 58:58.680
this, uh, unfortunately Dallas was the only place in America where you had

58:58.680 --> 59:02.520
regular armed groups in front of our mosques, it was happening around the

59:02.520 --> 59:06.080
country infrequently, but here it was happening every week.

59:06.560 --> 59:08.800
So the BBC reached out and said, we want to interview you.

59:09.360 --> 59:10.560
I said, we've got this idea.

59:10.560 --> 59:14.000
We want to put you, we want to take you to a park and have you meet one of the

59:14.000 --> 59:19.960
protesters, uh, who's been wielding his gun outside your mosque and talk to him.

59:20.760 --> 59:24.520
And it was really interesting because they'd interviewed him before meeting me

59:25.120 --> 59:29.280
and the things that he was able to utter before meeting me and before meeting

59:29.280 --> 59:32.920
Syrian refugees, uh, was just awful.

59:33.320 --> 59:38.080
I mean, the most dehumanizing rhetoric that you can imagine, but then at the

59:38.080 --> 59:41.560
park, he meets me, talks to me.

59:41.960 --> 59:44.000
He meets a Syrian refugee family.

59:44.680 --> 59:49.120
Uh, one of the girls whose leg had been blown off in an airstrike.

59:50.120 --> 59:52.280
And he said, I feel like an idiot.

59:52.640 --> 59:59.120
I mean, he expressed all sorts of regret and was teary eyed that he could

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.760
dehumanize people the way that he was.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.480
And so my whole thing was, and is come inside the mosque, put your gun down,

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:12.960
disarm yourself and learn, and you'll be surprised what you'll walk away with.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:21.280
And only took one meeting with him, um, to completely, uh, shift his worldview

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.400
at the time, which was made up of heroes and villains, the Muslims, unfortunately

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.240
being the villains that had to be wiped off the face of the earth so that the

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.120
earth could continue.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.520
So that was a, that was an interesting documentary and it was an interesting

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:36.600
social experiment.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:45.760
What's it feel like to have all these people that hate you and others in the

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:54.320
community, people you love, um, with guns, threatening violence, basically

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.760
that don't want you here in this country on this earth.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.120
Um, it's not nice.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.560
It's not great.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:09.560
I mean, it's, um, it's definitely a challenge, but look, there are challenges

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:14.520
that we face as, as Muslims, um, being in the United States, being in a hostile

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.560
climate and there are different types of challenges.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.800
And, uh, I think what we've had to do as a Muslim community is see beyond both

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:31.640
the guns and the roses and think about who we are first, because frankly, uh,

01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.880
Islamophobia exists in different forms and from different sides.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:43.560
And we try to use this as an opportunity to instill in our young people, not just

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:50.920
a sense of belonging, but a sense of purpose, uh, do not be intimidated and in

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:55.280
fact, show them the best of your Islam, live your life, because at the end of the

01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.960
day, the goal that is sought through intimidation is silence.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:06.280
And so we have to carry ourselves as proud American Muslims.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.640
We don't have to impress anyone and we don't need to relinquish an iota of our

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.800
faith to coexist with anyone.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.560
Uh, we are satisfied with who we are.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:28.360
We don't, we don't see a contradiction, uh, between our place of residence and our

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.000
religion, our nationality, our religion.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.920
We don't see that as a problem, right?

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.280
So that's a, that's something for them to work out, not for you to work out.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.280
That's what I would tell young Muslims that continue to live your faith fully

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.120
and demonstrate the beauty of it and do not let the ugliness of the world consume you.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.640
But for those young Muslims, what would you say how they should feel towards the

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.720
people that hate them?

01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:01.360
The natural human, there's a desire still to have anger, to have resentment, to

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.480
have hate back at the people that hate you.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.520
The Quran says respond to that, which is evil with that, which is better.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.640
And you will find that sometimes your enemy will become your close friend.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.800
Your close friend.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.680
So respond with that, which is better, doesn't mean be passive.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.440
Uh, sometimes there needs to be a demonstration of strength.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:30.880
Sometimes there needs to be a demonstration of, uh, ignoring, uh, people

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:36.800
altogether, but ultimately you can't let the way people treat you shape who

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.120
you're going to be in the world.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.600
And so that's why I say we have to look beyond the guns and the roses.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:48.120
We have to look beyond the hostility of our enemies and the temporary and

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.160
opportunistic embrace of some of those who claim to be our allies and be us and

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.720
treat the world and treat the people of this world in accordance with your

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.960
standards, not with theirs.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:04.680
So don't teach them, you know, or don't let them teach you bad character.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.920
You teach them good character.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.080
So live your life and, and, uh, live your faith beautifully and let people see

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.160
the beauty of it through your, through your being and do not let their

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.880
ugliness consume you, but at the same time, sometimes you've got to give

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:27.520
people room to express frustration, to, to say that this is unacceptable, to

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.080
have demonstrations of strength.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.640
And I think that those things don't have to all contradict each other.

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:39.600
What do you think about these kinds of protests are not allowed

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.760
in many parts of the world?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:46.320
What do you think about one of the most to you directly personally painful

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.680
manifestations of the first amendment of the people's right to freedom of

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:57.280
speech and to protest, to say hateful things, uh, you've been at the receiving

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.280
end of the worst of it.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.960
What, what, what, what do you feel about this particular freedom that, uh,

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.440
that's at the core of the founding of this country?

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.440
Look, I think that you have to take it away from the text and

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.320
look at it within reality.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:18.720
Let's be real, uh, would Muslims be able to protest in front of churches

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.760
with guns on a weekly basis in this country?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.440
I don't think so.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.520
So there's a deep, pragmatically speaking, there's a hypocrisy to what's

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.840
a lot of not major hypocrisy, major hypocrisy.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:35.160
See free speech is an ideal that is weaponized against the Muslim community

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.680
and against other communities, uh, in such a hypocritical way, you know,

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:42.480
you take, for example, some countries in Europe, you know, let's kind of

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.200
move away from this and look at the hypocrisy of, uh, a place like France

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.440
where the caricaturing and the portrayal of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon

01:05:53.480 --> 01:06:00.360
them in derogatory ways will be used as the hallmark of free speech, but Muslims

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:08.360
that will caricature, uh, Macron or challenge some of the values of France,

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:12.760
the supposed and trying values of France will end up in prison and end up deported.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.000
And so here in the United States, there's a great hypocrisy.

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:20.680
Uh, I don't think that, uh, places of worship should have

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.160
armed protesters in front of them.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.920
I think that that poses a security risk.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.800
I think that it's not okay.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:31.600
Um, and I think that free speech is weaponized against the Muslim

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:37.840
community and often is held up as this great value, but really to attain

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:42.640
very lowly things and, uh, is, is often to our detriment.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:44.160
Yeah.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:50.960
Just even watching that documentary, it's hard to put into words, but

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:57.840
somehow that does not capture, uh, what maybe the founders intended.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:03.440
What, uh, what I would see is the great ideal of the freedom of speech.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:08.240
Um, I don't know what the solution to that is.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.640
I think taking it outside of words, maybe that requires a community,

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.880
a cultural pressure to be better.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.200
Uh, so it's not about the law.

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.000
It's more about just the culture of pressure.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.240
What is, and isn't okay.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:25.120
Cause there's something deeply wrong about that kind of hate.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.920
Um, yeah, because it was dehumanizing other people that are here

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.680
in America, that they're Americans.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:34.520
Yeah.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:40.160
I mean, it's, it's, we have to interrogate the foundations of our

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.640
country when our country is in such turmoil and such chaos, uh, no country

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:51.560
in the world has the mass shootings that we have, no country in the world

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.080
has some of the polarization that we have.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:58.560
We have to interrogate that and say what it is that we're doing

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.160
wrong that's leading to that.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.800
And I think again, that it's, it's reaching a point where it's unsustainable.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:12.200
Um, if we don't do better and try to solve some of the rifts right now

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.720
that exists in our society, then we're going to end up in, you know, in a place

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.960
where we may, we may not be able to climb out of this.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.120
What do you think about, you mentioned the Muslim ban.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:30.120
What do you think about executive order 13769 titled protecting the nation

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:35.520
from foreign terrorist entry into the United States, often referred to as

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.840
the Muslim ban or the Trump travel ban.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.040
It was an executive order by president Trump.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:47.600
That was an effect from January 27th, 2017 for just a few months until March 6th,

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:54.880
2017, um, what was this executive order and what was its effect on your life

01:08:54.880 --> 01:09:00.160
and on the life of the Muslim community and just the life of Americans?

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:04.760
Well, it was disgraceful.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:13.280
It was a tactic that was used, uh, you know, at the time, um, very similar

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:18.320
to the whole build a wall rhetoric, um, to, to play to a particular political

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.320
sloganeering and carrying out those types of acts against the Muslim community.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:30.400
Uh, you're not going to face, uh, much opposition typically in any meaningful

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:34.600
way that would, that would be politically costly when he rolled it out.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.320
At the time there were people in flight on their way to the United States that

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.480
were held in airports around the country, um, children, elderly people that were

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.280
held in these small rooms and treated awfully before being put back on a plane

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.120
and sent to where they were.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.680
There were families that had medical needs that were never able to, uh, come together.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:05.320
He specifically targeted Muslim countries to play to that idea of a

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.640
complete ban of Muslims, which he knew was not feasible at the time.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.360
Now, personally, you know, Dallas had the, uh, the largest amount, the largest

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:20.320
number of, uh, detainees, uh, in the airport.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:26.000
We have one of the largest airports in America and, uh, we took to the airport

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.760
and we stayed there for a few days, uh, stayed overnight.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.600
It was one of the New York times pictures of the year when we did our prayer,

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.600
because when we had to do our prayer, it wasn't just Muslims that came to the

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.240
airport, um, it was many people that came to the airport of different faiths that

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.040
were outraged by what they had seen.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:48.560
So when we do our prayer, uh, there was a protest chant that you pray, we stay.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.560
And so the airport had to make room for us because like a thousand people that

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.200
needed to have our five daily prayers.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.280
So we would do our prayers in the airport.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:06.560
We waited, um, we continued until, um, the detainees were freed at least

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.440
temporarily, unfortunately, some elements of that legislation remained.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.680
And it was, it was an ongoing, uh, struggle, but look, what I'll say is

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.560
that those are some of the more obvious manifestations of anti-Muslim bigotry.

01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:26.280
But again, there's hypocrisy on all sides of the political aisle here in the

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.080
United States, there is Islamophobia of different flavors.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.640
I think even the term Islamophobia can become contentious because there are

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.360
people that attack us in different ways.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.120
And that might not be as overtly bigoted, but nonetheless, are infringing

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.200
on our rights to be full American Muslims.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.200
And Muslims find themselves in a very strange political place where you've

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:55.800
got one side that seemingly wants to annihilate you and another side that

01:11:55.800 --> 01:12:02.400
only accepts you if you're willing to assimilate, but no one really allows

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.800
you to be a full on American Muslim.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.480
And so Muslims find themselves in a very strange place right now with all

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.000
of the political sides, with the political parties.

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:14.600
Where do Muslims sit politically?

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.760
Are they politically engaged in the function of the United States?

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760
Where do they find themselves politically as a community?

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:25.440
So Muslims find themselves in an awkward place politically.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.040
That's the best way to put it.

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:35.280
We are a religious community and so we don't find ourselves welcomed, uh, by

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.800
the left, which has a hostility towards religion and most left spaces and

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.240
most liberal spaces in general.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.880
Because it's a kind of religion has many conservative elements.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.360
Right.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.520
So the Muslim community is in its nature, conservative for what that's worth.

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:49.720
Right.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.240
It's a conservative community.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:59.440
It's a community that has certain orthodoxies and practices that would make

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.480
it disagreeable in its nature and its practice to many on the left and many

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:10.000
on the right, just see us as a group of foreigners and a threat in that regard.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.520
So, um, we find ourselves in this awkward place.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:20.080
There's also the presence of sort of the pro-Israel, uh, dominance of both parties.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:23.920
The foreign policy of both parties is detrimental to Muslims globally.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.800
Um, the securitization of the Muslim community and the name of

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.400
countering violent extremism.

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.600
Unfortunately, the Muslim community has had both Republican and democratic

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760
administrations just run over to rights.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.680
So we find ourselves kind of in this awkward space, right?

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.600
We are a religious community.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.680
That's also a minority.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.280
The racialization of the Muslim community sort of robs us of who we are and how we

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:56.800
get to engage them with different platforms and different peoples around us.

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.440
So we find ourselves in a very awkward place.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:05.760
Is there in general, a lack of representation in, um, places of power

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.440
in politics?

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.000
I don't think representation is everything.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.240
I think that representation can actually be detrimental sometimes because you can

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:18.960
have people that, uh, represent you, but that don't actually represent your,

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.480
your, your priorities as a community, as a faith community.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.120
So we don't want to be tokenized as a community, right?

01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:30.880
We want to be engaged and engaged fully as Muslims and be

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.520
respected as American Muslims.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:35.080
You know, I wrote something at the time actually of Muslim ban.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.320
I wrote an article for CNN called, I am not your American Muslim.

01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.880
I am not your American Muslim because we are not a tool of liberals against

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.120
conservatives, nor are we simply to be made out to be your villain or your

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:57.200
victim where a people of faith, where people that have values, where people

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:01.520
that want to see our places of worship thrive, where people that have something

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.440
to offer, uh, to this country, to the people around us of, of good, but

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:13.640
ultimately we want to engage and be engaged with on the basis of who we

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:16.200
actually are, not who you need us to be right now.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.520
And that's been the problem that we've had.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.920
So it's not, it's not a lack of representation as much as a

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.320
lack of authentic engagement.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:34.480
You mentioned, uh, daily prayer and if I may looking at the time, this might be

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:41.160
time, um, and, uh, if it's okay, I would love it if you allowed me to follow

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.920
along, at least in a movement, um, as you pray.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:45.640
Sure.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.280
Absolutely.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:49.560
Thank you for allowing me to join you in that.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:56.000
Can you maybe describe what, what does the prayer represent?

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.760
What is the actual practice of prayer like?

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.080
What is the process like?

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.320
Sure.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.800
So prayer is the central pillar, if you will, of Islam.

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:14.800
Um, it is the life of the believer, um, encapsulated in to a very specific

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:20.760
act of devotion that's done at least five times a day.

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.320
So there are different types of prayer.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:24.720
There's prayer, there's supplication.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.440
So the five daily prayers are called Salah, which is the obligatory prayers.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.080
And then beyond that, there are voluntary prayers that are

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.440
done, uh, throughout the day as well.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.200
So you can pray before and after the obligatory prayers.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:42.400
And then there are other times of the day that you can pray also.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.800
And the best prayer, voluntary prayer is at night in the middle of the night.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:51.120
Cause it's the time that you're closest to God, uh, sincere, um, away from the

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:55.760
eyes of people, uh, just in the still of the night and you'd pray in a similar

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:59.480
way with the standing and the bowing and the prostration reciting the Quran.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.800
And then you have supplication and words of remembrance that you are to do

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.560
throughout the day, um, between all of that.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.400
So when people say, do you pray five times a day?

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.760
I say at least five times a day.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.280
Um, what are the words of supplication?

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.640
Do they come from the Quran or do they come from your own heart?

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.040
Or do they, what, where do they come from?

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.440
So basically you say Allahu Akbar, uh, which means I'm going to kill you.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:20.720
Right.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.360
Or so they say, God is greater.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.880
You start off with that and expression of God's greatness.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.760
And then you recite the opening chapter of the Quran, which is known as Al Fatiha.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.200
It's the first chapter of the Quran, uh, in the name of God, the most

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.640
compassionate, the most merciful, all praises be to God, the Lord of all the

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.720
worlds, most compassionate, most merciful master of the day of judgment.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.640
You alone, we worship and from you alone, we seek help guide us to the straight

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:51.200
path, the path of those who have earned your favor, not those who have earned

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.960
your wrath, nor those who have gone astray.

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.640
So that's a translation of the first chapter, the opening chapter of the

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.760
Quran, which is known as Al Fatiha.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.360
So we recite that in every one of the units of prayer.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.000
Um, and then after that, we recite something else from the Quran.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.400
So some other portion of the Quran.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.440
And then we say, Allahu Akbar, once again, God is greater.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:17.200
We go into bowing and in bowing, we say, Subh'ana Rabbia Al Azeem,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.280
Subh'ana Rabbia Al Azeem, Subh'ana Rabbia Al Azeem, which means glory

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.880
be to God, the Almighty, glory be to God, the Almighty, glory be to God, the Almighty.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.440
And then you come back up and you say, Sami'a Allahu Li Man Hamidah, God has

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.880
heard the one who has praised him.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.240
And then the response is, Rabbana Walaka Al Hamd.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.560
And to you, O Lord belongs all praise.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:44.240
And then we go into prostration and prostration is at the heart of the prayer.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:51.800
And it is the most beautiful portion of the prayer and it is the most beloved

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:56.360
position for a servant of God and that which is most pleasing to God.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.520
It's when you say at that point, Subh'ana Rabbia Al Azeem, all glory

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:05.560
be to God, the Most High, all glory be to God, the Most High.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:10.920
So while you put yourself in the lowest position, you acknowledge God being the

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.040
Most High and the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said that the

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:17.720
closest that a person is to God is when they are in prostration.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.960
That is the time that your supplications are most precious and beloved.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.360
That is the time that you can cry your heart out.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:30.960
That is the time that you really feel a sense of great closeness and devotion to

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.680
God. And as I was telling you earlier, it's a time that your mind is under

01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:35.760
your heart for a change, right?

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.720
The only position, physical position that your mind is actually under your heart.

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:44.480
And you really have a chance to pour your emotions out and to connect deeply to God.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.920
It's the prayer of all of the prophets.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.760
Jesus, peace be upon him, is described even biblically as falling on his face in

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:57.680
prayer. And so it really is, I think, the most intimate moment that you get with God

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.720
and the deepest part of the prayer.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:05.760
The word Masjid, which is mosque in Arabic, means place of sujood, place of

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:11.400
prostration. So think of the rest of prayer as an introduction to that particular part

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.320
of the prayer where you really immerse yourself.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.720
Not that you shouldn't be immersed in your prayer throughout, but when you're in

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:21.600
sujood, when you're in prostration, that's where you're really closest and most

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.160
connected to God. So we do that.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:28.080
And so some prayers are two units.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.440
Well, the first prayer of the day, which is before sunrise, the earliest prayer is

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:40.280
two units. The second prayer, which is around noon, is four units.

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.600
And then afternoon, another four units.

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.040
And then the sunset prayer is three units.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.880
And then the evening prayer is four units.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.400
So each prayer has a different number of units to it and some voluntary prayers

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.400
that surround it. When you come back up, you express also a form of greeting

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.840
towards God and channeling your prayers and your blessings towards God.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.640
You reiterate the Shahada, which is the first pillar of Islam.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.200
I testify that there is only one God and that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:15.640
And then you read what's called Salah Ibrahimiyah, which is the Abrahamic prayer.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.440
So you send peace and blessings upon Muhammad and his family and Abraham and his

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:24.560
family. Abraham, peace be upon him, is really at the core of this religion.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:29.560
And so at the prayer, at the end of the prayer, you send peace and blessings and

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.880
prayers upon, again, both Muhammad and his family and Abraham and his family.

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:36.680
And then you have another chance to make some of your own personal prayers.

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:43.120
And then you say, peace be on to you and the mercy of God to your right.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.640
Peace be on to you and the mercy of God to your left.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.280
And that means everything and everyone to your right, everyone and everything to

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:54.600
your left. So you imagine a congregation when you're in worship, right?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.840
You're sending that to the angels and the human beings next to you, your

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.120
fellow worshipers next to you.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.040
And you'll even say, you'll seek forgiveness from God afterwards.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.360
There are supplications that surround the prayer.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:12.480
And you will say, Allahumma antassalamu amminkassalam, that, O Allah, O God, you

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:18.600
are peace and from you is peace and to you belongs all glory and all praise.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.640
Almost to say that you received something in this prayer, that you receive a great

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.960
sense of inner peace and now you're spreading that, right?

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:31.720
So as it really comes into you, then you can give to the world around you what you

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.680
generate in your own heart.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.000
And in prayer, you generate a great sense of tranquility, a great sense of peace.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.440
The Quran says, verily in the remembrance of God do hearts find contentment.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:47.880
And prayer is an exercise in the remembrance of God.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.640
That is, again, obligatory five times a day, no matter where you are.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:59.000
So anywhere in the world, anywhere you find yourself in your life, in different

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.840
life circumstances, anywhere.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.240
Yeah.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:04.520
So outside of the coffee shop in the grass, outside of the coffee shop.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.000
As it did a few days ago.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:09.320
So anywhere at all.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.880
And that means airports included.

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.680
Given the context of our previous conversation of

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:24.200
hatred towards people of Muslim faith, that means you probably, through the practice of prayer,

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.800
it attracts people that hate.

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.080
I've attracted curiosity.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:27.880
I've attracted hate.

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:29.880
I've had people walk up to me like, hey, man, you okay?

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:31.240
In the airport.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:31.880
Everything.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:36.600
So most probably is conversations of curiosity and the opportunity to actually

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.720
talk about the values that you represent.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.240
And I try to make it a point to tell people if I'm about to pray in front of them.

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:47.480
So like in an airport, let's say, for example, go to the corner next to a gate.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.400
And if there are people sitting there like, hey, I'm about to engage in a prayer.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.120
I hope you don't mind.

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:54.120
They'll really appreciate the courtesy most of the time.

01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.280
But no, I mean, when those five times come in and they're kind of windows, right?

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:02.840
We have to pray.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.520
And that means at work.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.480
That means at school.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.160
That means when you're traveling.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.280
Although there's some concessions that allow you to combine prayers at

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.920
certain times when you're traveling, for example.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.520
But even then, you're going to have to pray.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:30.840
And I think that what that does to bring you back to God, no matter what you're doing,

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:34.200
it's actually, you know, you think of it this way.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.320
You're in a meeting.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.760
You're engaged in something.

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.800
You're really stressed out.

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:41.960
And you also have the ablution before the prayer where you wash up,

01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:45.080
wash your face, wash your limbs, and engage in prayer.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.240
What it does for you in anchoring you in something more meaningful

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:58.760
when you are in the turmoil of a lot of times what's not so meaningful is incredible.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.280
And so it's a gift from God.

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.640
And it is an obligation.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.880
It's something that we have to do as Muslims.

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:14.040
But if you actually learn its essence, then it can feel more like a joy than it is an obligation.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.200
And then you're called to at night, especially again, the night prayer

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.200
is a big part of who we are as Muslims.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.520
Waking up in the last part of the night, the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.320
said that the best prayer and the best fasting was of that of David, peace be upon him.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.560
So we think of David, the Prophet David.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.760
He's a prophet in Islam as well.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.320
I'm sure you'll ask me about the whole concept of prophethood.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:38.040
You're hearing Abraham and David and others, right?

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:42.920
So David, peace be upon him, he said that David used to fast every other day

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.880
and he used to pray the last third of the night.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.800
He'd stand up and pray in the last third of the night.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.960
So fasting is a big part of who we are.

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:58.120
And praying in the last third of the night, meaning before that early morning prayer,

01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:01.160
waking up if you can at 4 a.m., 4.30 a.m., 5 a.m.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:07.720
And praying even for a few minutes, there's something in the serenity of the night

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:15.240
that can unlock in you a sense of inner joy and peace that nothing else in the world can give you.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.400
And again, that pulls you away from all the turmoil of day-to-day life.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:25.640
If it's little things or if it's big things, it just pulls you out of it

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.080
and to remember what is more important in life.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:34.680
So when we think about access, in the last third of the night, we're taught that God says,

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.320
is there anyone seeking forgiveness that I may forgive them?

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.080
Is there anyone seeking refuge that I may grant it to them?

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.680
Is there anyone asking for anything that I may give it to them?

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:47.560
So whatever you're calling upon him with at that time,

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.680
he's responding to you in a way that befits him.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.200
And so it's closeness as well.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:55.480
It's closeness as well.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:02.920
And you would think that you sleep less, so you're probably more cranky, but

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.880
the happiest people in the world are the people that stand up in that last third of the night

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:08.680
and pray.

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:14.520
I mean, there's a deeply meditative, contemplative aspect to it that I think

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:20.120
probably strengthens your sleep, if anything else, once you return to it.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.080
There you go.

01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:22.360
See, people underestimate that.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.640
There's a great sage in Islam.

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:26.920
He was asked, he said, how come the people who pray at night

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.800
are the most beautiful of people and they're fresh in the day?

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.600
It doesn't make sense.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.880
And he said, because they secluded themselves with the most merciful,

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.400
and he dressed them in his light.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.040
And so there's a beauty that it generates.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:46.520
And that's why we're to aspire to that, really, as believers.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:47.880
That's kind of your highest thing.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.080
Don't just pray the five prayers.

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.040
If you can pray at night, pray at night and connect at that time.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.560
Well, a good friend of mine, Andrew Huberman, who's a neuroscientist from Stanford,

01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:02.200
he has an amazing podcast called Huberman Lab, but he's also a scholar of sleep,

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:04.680
among many other things.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.280
And so I would love him to, he probably knows the science on this too.

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.120
There's probably good science that actually studies practicing Muslims to see what,

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.240
the benefits of sleep.

01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:19.560
I would love to actually see what that says.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.720
We have amazing, I don't want to cut you off.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.840
We have amazing hygiene because of how much we have to wash up for prayer.

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:27.480
And it's great for our limbs as well.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.400
And that's one of the added benefits.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.200
It's good for us.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:35.080
Worship that we do is not torturous.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.360
It's actually good for us.

01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:41.640
However, the core objective of worship has to remain that it's something you do out of

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.640
worship and something you do out of a sense of obligation and gratitude to God,

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.400
not because of those things.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:50.760
I'm not gonna fast because it's good for my health, but I know it's good for my health to fast.

01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:54.280
But it's pretty cool when you walk into, I'll share this with you.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.800
There was a man, he was a scholar from Turkey, an Islamic scholar from Turkey.

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:03.320
And he had visited us in Dallas and he was 108 years old.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:08.120
And he could still pray, bowing and prostrating, I mean, his limbs.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:11.160
And you think about that, like someone at that age still being able to do that.

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.760
So I'm sure it's good for your limbs.

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:15.720
It's good for your health, good for your gut, good for your sleep, good for your mind.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.240
I think the mind one is the really one we've been talking about.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:21.640
And that's really the big one.

01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.960
And in the small day-to-day psychological sense and in the big philosophical sense

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:27.880
of what it means to be a human being.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:36.360
We should also mention that during the prayer, as you've explained, you should face Mecca.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:42.360
So what is Mecca and what's the experience of visiting Mecca like?

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:50.360
So Mecca is the home that Abraham, peace be upon him, built along with his son Ishmael,

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.240
peace be upon him.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:56.360
And it gives the Muslims a unified direction of prayer.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:02.920
It's sort of at the center geographically of who we are.

01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:13.080
And when we pray towards it, it's not that that's the only place that you can

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.200
supplicate turn towards, but it gives us a unified sense of direction.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.800
It gives us a unified sense of prayer.

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:22.760
So Mecca is our Qibla.

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.600
It's our place of direction when we are alive and when we are dead.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.440
So actually we pray facing towards it.

01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:31.320
When we die, we are also faced towards it in our graves.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.960
And it kind of gives us that unifying spirit.

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:40.360
So this is the Valley of Mecca, also in the Bible spoken about the Valley of Mecca,

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:45.640
and where other biblical scholars would also mention Mount Perun.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:54.440
And it is the place that Adam, in the Quran, Adam, peace be upon him, first had a place

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.840
constructed there as a place of worship from the angels towards God.

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:06.600
And then when Abraham settles Hagar and Ishmael in Mecca, they build this house of worship.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:13.560
And that is where the gushing springs of Zamzam are mentioned, where God sends an angel

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:20.520
to give a miracle to Hagar and Ishmael that they can sustain themselves from

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:22.040
as they're not left in the desert.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:29.720
So Ishmael being the firstborn son of Abraham is given a place and there's a story and a history

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:33.000
that's going to unfold from that place of Mecca.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.440
And then Isaac is born, peace be upon him, 13 years later.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:39.320
And there's a story and a history that comes from that.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:43.160
But ultimately, Mecca is the center.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.800
Mecca is where we turn towards for prayer.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.240
Mecca is where we perform the pilgrimage, the Hajj pilgrimage.

01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:54.600
Once in our lives, at least if we can, physically and financially, if we find ourselves capable,

01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:58.120
we at least perform the Hajj pilgrimage once in our lifetimes.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.720
But there are other pilgrimages throughout the year you can go.

01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:08.600
At any time of the day, any time of the year, you will find people that will be performing the

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:12.680
pilgrimage, an iteration of the pilgrimage in Mecca.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.840
And it's an incredible practice.

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:22.120
It really is a place where you feel like you're no longer in this world.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.120
I mean, it's incredible.

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:28.120
So we all go there, donning what's known as the Ihram garb.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:37.480
So the men will wear just these white garments, which are resembling or they resemble the

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.160
garments that we will be buried in.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:49.000
Whether you're a king or a prince or a peasant, in classical terms, whoever you are,

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.520
whatever distinction you have, you're all the same.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:55.400
And the women will wear a simple garment as well.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:04.920
So you go there, you relinquish all of the pretensions and concerns and superficial

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.520
barriers and distinctions that exist in this life.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:16.200
And we do what's called tawaf, circle around the Kaaba, symbolically putting God at the

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.160
center of our lives.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:25.400
We do seven rounds between Safa and Marwa, the two mountains, where Hagar, when she once

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:30.360
ran between those two mountains with her baby Ishmael looking for water, trusting God was

01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:31.160
provided for.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:36.920
We too go between the two mountains of Safa and Marwa to express that trust in God and

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:37.800
to follow in that way.

01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:46.120
And these are ultimately, these are the rituals that Abraham himself engaged in our tradition

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.920
and the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, engaged in.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:53.160
And so we engage in the exact same rituals and there are divine wisdoms to them that

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.520
we might not even be able to unpack and reflect upon.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:34:05.400
But it really is in that place where you find the most beautiful global expression of Islam.

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.880
You see people from all over the world, people that don't speak the same languages, people

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:12.840
from all sorts of backgrounds, and they're all doing the exact same thing.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:18.920
And in a matter of seconds, when the call of prayer comes, in a matter of seconds, two,

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:22.840
three million people get arranged in perfect rows for prayer, right?

01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:31.320
And it just, it looks like this perfect optical vision of just beauty when you see people

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:37.160
in unison standing, bowing, prostrating, and you don't know who the person next to you is.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.720
And that's where, you know, Malcolm X, you read about the history of Malcolm X.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.080
When he went to Hajj, that's where his entire worldview shifts.

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:58.840
Not just his previous baggage, but the dream that he then had, the possibilities that he saw

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:03.160
for people to be able to overcome some of the false distinctions that we have,

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:11.160
race and class, and to see God as one and to come together

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.760
and worship him alone and also seeing each other, equal participants in that worship.

01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.480
LW If we can just linger on it a little bit.

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:25.240
I think you've mentioned that Malcolm X has been in part misunderstood.

01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:28.920
What are some aspects of him that are misunderstood?

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.000
CB Well, I think reading his autobiography is

01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.040
extremely important for anyone that wants to understand him, right? So you read him

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:44.680
in his own words. Malcolm lived the tragedy of being a young, disenfranchised black man in

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:54.440
America who went through all of the difficulties that were posed in a 1950s America towards him.

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:59.800
He went through the system and it was awful for him and he had to pull himself out of that and

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:07.400
make himself into an incredible orator and incredible leader that suddenly had a pretty

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:15.400
empowering vision and a calm and nonetheless courageous but a calm presence to him and was

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.000
able to bring together people, especially uplift black people in America to believe in themselves.

01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:28.920
Young men in America, in prisons in particular, will read the autobiography of Malcolm X and see

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:38.600
hope for themselves to come out of the darkness of being in prison not just by the bars in front of

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:47.720
them but also by what they thought to be their own worth prior to that moment. So Malcolm climbs

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:56.920
out of that and he goes through multiple phases. So Malcolm dies as an orthodox Muslim who does not

01:36:56.920 --> 01:37:04.520
believe in the superiority of one race over the other, finds great tranquility in the practice

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:12.520
of the Hajj, great clarity. I think you read his letters from Mecca and he talks about his change,

01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:18.440
his transformation in particular and it was a process. It's a process for him but he inspires

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.960
the likes of Muhammad Ali to become the person that he becomes and inspires many other people

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:31.880
till today to really see themselves and see the world differently in light of that

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:39.720
understanding of monotheism. So he was deeply a man of faith and throughout his life the nature of

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:49.080
that faith has changed as he grew, as he interacted with I would say a cruel society that he was

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:57.320
living. You mentioned he inspired Muhammad Ali who I don't think is an overstatement to say is

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:04.600
probably the most, quite possibly the most famous American Muslim from America. Could you maybe

01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:15.480
make a few comments as an athlete yourself? What impact did Islam have on Muhammad Ali's life and

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:22.840
vice versa? What impact did he have as a leader, as a religious figure on the Muslim community?

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.960
I think Muhammad Ali, his quotes on Islam are precious because he talks about how he sought

01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:35.160
the wealth of this world and he found it in Islam. He found a greater meaning and he attributes

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:41.880
everything that he became to his faith. His sense of strength and commitment,

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:52.200
the willingness to take a stand for the truth when it was extremely unpopular

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.360
on the basis of his faith and on the basis of his integrity.

01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:01.960
I think that he inspired people with his confidence and

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:12.600
his coherence. I mean he was incredibly eloquent, I mean poetic and just unwavering,

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:19.160
seemed unbreakable. So as relentless as he was in the ring, he was even more so outside of the

01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:26.600
ring. The man could not be broken and everything was stacked up against him but he perseveres

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:33.880
and he does so then through Parkinson's and chooses to live a life of giving,

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:41.800
a life of service, a life of using his platform to bring up issues of importance and to champion

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:46.600
the rights of others. So he wasn't satisfied at any point in his life with simply being a boxing

01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:52.920
great, a boxing champion. He uses it for so much more. And so he goes down as one of the most

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.640
famous Americans period of the 20th century, one of the most transformative Americans period

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:03.640
of the 20th century, not just American Muslims. And a lot of people that loved him when he died

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:10.760
would not have loved him if they were around in the 1960s and the 1970s. They said they loved

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.920
him when he couldn't speak anymore. Many of those who celebrated him at the time of his death

01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.520
would have been his greatest opponents at the peak of his career and when he was taking the

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.320
stance that he was taking. Yeah, he was fearless and part of this, his faith was helping him

01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:30.600
take the fearless stance. But throughout all of it, given the strength, I think he's also a symbol

01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:39.160
of compassion through all the fun kind of, yeah, the poetic nature of who he was and the fearless

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:45.800
nature of who he was. There's always like a deep love for the sport and for humanity.

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:51.160
Absolutely. And that's the thing, right? It was so obvious that despite everything that had happened

01:40:51.160 --> 01:41:02.120
to him, he never loses himself, neither to the fame nor to the fear. He always stays himself.

01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.080
He's authentic. And I went to his funeral and it was one of the most beautiful

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:14.520
things I've ever seen because everyone in Louisville, Kentucky had a story with Muhammad

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:23.400
Ali, right? The guy that he saves from committing suicide, the school kids, the hotel shuttle

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:28.600
driver, the gas station worker, everyone has a story of Muhammad Ali in Louisville, Kentucky.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:36.600
And when he passes away, everybody comes out and stands in front of their homes

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:41.960
and they take the casket and they drive around the streets of Louisville. And he had this dream,

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:49.080
I'm very close to some of his children, incredible people, by the way, just incredible human beings.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:55.240
And he had this dream that he shared with them that he was jogging around the streets of Louisville,

01:41:55.240 --> 01:42:03.080
Kentucky, and everyone had come out to wave to him. And so he's running around jogging and

01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:07.160
waving to everybody in the streets of Louisville, Kentucky. Then he gets to the cemetery

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:13.480
and he says he flies into the heavens. So his dream, and he had this dream years ago,

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:20.520
and if you look at his funeral, it's such a beautiful, you can't make it up. It's such a

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.440
beautiful moment where it seems to come to reality because everybody in Louisville just

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:31.640
comes out and just waves by to his casket. And then when he gets to the cemetery, the gates close

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.880
and he goes off to be with his Lord. And we pray that it's a good place for him.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.880
So Muhammad Ali is probably one of the great 20th century representatives of Islam. For me,

01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:49.000
personally, at least, hopefully I'm not showing my bias, one of the great modern representatives

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.960
is Khabib Nareem Ahmedov, who's a great fighter and a great human being. So you've gotten a chance

01:42:53.960 --> 01:43:00.040
to meet him. I should also say you're friends, you're good friends with a lot of really interesting

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:05.400
Muslim people. I mean, it's such a widespread religion. There's just so much variety of

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:13.080
different people that are practicing Muslims. So what does Khabib represent? What do you like

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:17.480
about him as a Muslim? What do you like about him as a person, as representative of the religion?

01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:25.880
I think Khabib, first of all, he is a great person, humble person. He's shown,

01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:31.000
and now Islam as well, kind of following in that. They're really showing the beauty of

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.240
faith in their lives, their culture, their values, everything from the way

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:46.680
that he carried himself in a principled way. Every Muslim kid grew up in a public school

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.080
cafeteria before Islamic schools were a thing in the United States, not eating pork, for example,

01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:59.480
and kind of being the odd person out. So when you got a fighter in the UFC scene and doesn't drink

01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:09.880
alcohol, kind of maintains like a very consistent, principled attachment to his religion,

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.120
it really is inspiring. Growing up, we had Hakim El-Ajwan in the 1990s,

01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:19.000
basketball who was fasting in the NBA. I think Khabib is that for a lot of people,

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.800
a lot of young people today and people in general. And I think beyond that, the values,

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:31.240
how he honored his father and how he honors his mother and how he continues to put family first.

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.880
That's a beautiful part of Islam. That's a beautiful part of our value system.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:43.960
We have a lot of emphasis on family. Family is central to Islam and his honoring of his father

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:50.600
was so beautiful. And again, what he's willing to do for his mother, it's just so beautiful.

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:57.480
And I think that we saw it frankly, even with Morocco and the World Cup. There was a lot of

01:44:57.480 --> 01:45:06.040
Islamophobia in this recent World Cup episode. A lot of the criticism of Qatar, while no government

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.560
is beyond reproach, certainly no government is beyond reproach, but had very obvious blatant

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.880
Islamophobic undertones. And then with Morocco rising, being the first African Muslim Arab team

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.040
to get that far in the World Cup, what did you see? Beyond the consistent honoring of Palestine,

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:29.400
you also saw the honoring of the mothers. Every single time the game would end, they go into a

01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:34.040
prostration of gratitude. So just like we prostrate in prayer, a prostration of gratitude.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.440
And then they go and they kiss their mother's foreheads, dance with their mothers on the

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:44.280
field, hug their moms and honor their moms. That's Islam for you. Khabib, after his fight,

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.480
what does he do? He prostrates. He points up to the heavens. It's God. And then he prostrates.

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:57.000
The whole Moroccan team beautifully prostrates. Even when they lost, they prostrated out of

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:02.280
gratitude. They honored their mothers. So I think sometimes athletes are able to demonstrate

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.160
some of these beautiful values of Islam in a way that the world can maybe see them in a different

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:14.520
light. The values of humility and the values of love, love broadly, but love for family.

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:21.720
And look how everyone around Khabib talks about him, right? No one ever says he's a jerk. No one

01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.600
ever says he's mistreated them. They've all got stories, right? And that's what a beautiful

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:33.000
Muslim does, a beautiful human being. You treat the people in such a way that all these stories

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.840
come out later of how good you were to everyone that came into contact with you. And Khabib was

01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:43.720
that person. He is that person. He does a great job of treating people with a lot of respect.

01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:49.560
Obviously, no one is perfect, right? I mean, imperfections are for everybody, but

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:56.440
I definitely think that he did a beautiful job representing his faith in those moments.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:03.000
You know, beyond punching people in the face, that's kind of a different subject. Smashing faces,

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:11.080
not the smashing faces part, the prostration part and the humility. I tell you, man, he's not humble

01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:17.560
in the ring, right? He would maul his opponents, right? But I mean, as a practitioner, as a fan of

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:23.640
the sport, of all the grappling sports for me, there's also a beauty to the art of grappling and

01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:34.120
the fighting sports. But yes, I think his, again, humility, his honor outside the cage is exemplary.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.840
And the money, the fame, the power hasn't changed the man.

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.600
No, not at all. And that's actually, I think, the most beautiful part. When I met him,

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:51.640
I found him to be as humble as he is on screen. And that's always very endearing. And all of the

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:56.200
stories of the people that have been around him for a much longer time, very humble man.

01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:03.400
I pray for him. Honestly, I pray for Islam. I pray for that family, that God keeps them grounded,

01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.160
protected and together, and that they maintain that beautiful spirit. Because even if you just

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:14.840
watch the lead up to the last fight with Islam, just the way they carry themselves, their day to

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:21.880
day, they never relinquish their prayers. They never relinquish their family ties, the things

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:29.400
that make them who they are to be better fighters, because they don't see that they have to let go

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:35.720
of those things. In fact, they attribute all of their worldly success to that faith. And so,

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:42.280
beautiful examples. And I think that it's good for young Muslims to see themselves in that. And

01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:45.720
it's good for other people to see Islam through that as well.

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.960
When you mention the prophets, you often say, peace and blessings be upon them.

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:52.460
Yes.

01:48:54.120 --> 01:49:00.760
What does that phrase mean? Why do you say it? Is it to celebrate the people?

01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.480
Is it a constant reminder that these are figures that should be celebrated?

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.080
Absolutely. So, it's part of our tradition that when we say the name of a prophet,

01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:12.200
at least the first time in the conversation, we say, peace be upon him.

01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:17.160
And then afterwards, it's still praiseworthy to say, peace be upon him.

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:21.560
So, if you're reading an Islamic article and you see in parentheses,

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:27.960
PBUH, peace be on to him or peace be upon him. When I was in high school, I often tell the story,

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:31.480
I wrote an article about Jesus, peace be upon him in Islam and Christianity.

01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.240
And my teacher comes up to me and she says, you can't do that. I said, what? And she slams the

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:46.200
paper on the desk. She says, you can't say Jesus. And I said, no, no, PBUH, peace be upon him.

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:52.680
So, that's what it means and something that we reserve for the prophets of God and we

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:56.040
honor them with. So, who is Muhammad?

01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.280
So, the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, is the descendant of Abraham, peace be upon him,

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:09.800
through Ishmael. God promises Hagar and Ishmael that he will make of him a great nation.

01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:17.320
And so, there are prophets that are descended from Isaac and then from the brothers of Isaac

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:23.480
comes the prophet Muhammad. And he is the final prophet of a long line of prophets.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:28.360
And we do not distinguish between the prophets in regards to their role.

01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:35.480
And so, Islam has a very accessible theology. It's something that resonates with a professor

01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:42.200
at an Ivy League university and a person who may be even illiterate. This idea of one God that

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:48.760
sends many prophets and all of the prophets had a singular message, worship one God and respond to

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:55.320
the messages of that one God through his messengers. So, Adam, through Muhammad,

01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:00.120
you have many of the prophets that are mentioned in the Old Testament. Moses,

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.720
peace be upon him, being the most spoken about prophet in the Quran. In fact, Abraham,

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:11.320
Jesus, peace be upon him, many of these prophets that are familiar to people, all of them are

01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.560
considered prophets. And Islam, the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, being the last of

01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:24.280
them. He comes at a time where there was still a lot of confusion about what the world had just

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.640
encountered in Christ, in Jesus Christ, peace be upon him. So, you got to think about it this way,

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:36.920
that this is still, you know, he's born in the sixth century. There is still great debate

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.960
about who Jesus was. The Council of Nicaea happens in the fourth century,

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:47.800
where you kind of have a standardizing of Western Christianity. But then you have Eastern

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:51.400
Christians that are still maintaining very different theologies and very different

01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:59.880
conceptions of Christ. There is no Arabic Bible at the time. And he kind of brings together

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:07.400
the message and the mission of all of those prophets. And it fits perfectly into

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:15.400
a singular string of thought, where you don't have to reject Jesus, peace be upon him. But Islam also

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:20.440
is staunchly opposed to the idea of a trinity, the idea of a begotten son of God, that all the

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:25.720
conceptions of the Messiah, and there were many claimants of the Messiah prior to Christ, peace

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:33.480
be upon him. None of them included an idea of a trinity or of him actually being a part of God

01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:40.840
himself, a begotten son of God, but rather a great and mighty prophet that would restore glory on

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:49.160
earth. So, he really captures theologically, or rather we would say God captures through him

01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:55.720
theologically, a coherence and a unifying message of all of the prophets, that there is only one

01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:03.240
God and that that God has sent messages and scriptures to ultimately guide people back

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:08.680
towards him. And that all of the prophets are equal in the sight of God. There is no distinction

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:17.960
between them. And that we are to live our lives in accordance with the message as best manifested

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:22.360
by the messenger. And so, the prophets are exemplary human beings. And this is where

01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:30.120
we kind of sometimes maybe have a difference. Someone will say, well, Noah did this and David

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:35.960
did this. As Muslims, we don't hold many of the stories that have been attributed to these prophets

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:41.880
to be true. We don't believe that the prophets are capable of major sins. We believe they're

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:47.560
exemplary human beings and that they kind of give us a manifestation of the scriptures that

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:52.520
they were sent with, of how to live noble lives. And the most documented human being in history

01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.920
is the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. We know everything about him, his family life,

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.240
his day to day, the way he would greet you, the way he'd look at you, everything about his

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:08.120
physical appearance. It's documented in immaculate detail. And Muslims have a standard that they then

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:14.440
seek to live up to with how to treat your family, how to be in your community, how to be in your

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:19.240
worship, how to be in your social interactions, how to carry yourself with your neighbors.

01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:27.640
It's a full, complete guidebook through his example where we have the Quran, which is the

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:32.200
word of God. And then you have the biography of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, which is

01:54:33.240 --> 01:54:40.680
a living manifestation of that word that has been documented for us to live by until the end of time.

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:45.240
So Muhammad, if I may, peace be upon him,

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:54.200
is really the, like you said, the manifestation, the thing to be, the example of a good man.

01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:56.280
Yes, example of a good human being.

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.480
Is the Quran the word of God?

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:06.360
So the Quran, and this is what distinguishes the Quran in many ways from other scriptures. So as

01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:13.480
Muslims, we do believe that God has sent divine revelation prior. We believe that the original

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:20.280
scriptures prior to the multiple versions and the changes and revisions throughout history,

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:27.080
the original scriptures that were given to the prophets, whether it was the Torah to Moses

01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:34.120
or the gospels, were all original divine revelations, but they've been changed over

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:39.240
time. The Quran is the word of God with a promise that he will guard it for all of time.

01:55:39.240 --> 01:55:45.800
And it's probably one of the greatest miracles because in 1400 years, we have the Quran preserved

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:50.840
through oral transmission and through written transmission. And there are almost 2 billion

01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:55.720
Muslims in the world and they all recite this book the exact same way. And there's only one version

01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:05.080
of it. And so when I'm reciting the Quran, if I say ooh or ee or ah differently, an Ethiopian Muslim,

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:10.760
a Chinese Muslim, a Yemeni Muslim can correct me. An eight-year-old kid in any one of those countries

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.080
can correct me because they will know that this is not how it's memorized. And so it was memorized

01:56:15.640 --> 01:56:20.600
from the start, committed to memory in the time of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:27.640
and preserved in writing and passed down and memorized by millions and millions of

01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:34.680
people around the world. And it's 600 pages. And you can't go to a city in America,

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:40.600
a city in the United States of America and not find at least one person or a group of

01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:45.320
people that memorize it, that have committed it to memory. And so there's an emphasis on

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:51.720
committing it to memory as well as understanding it and applying it and practicing it as much as we

01:56:51.720 --> 01:57:03.560
can. What are some maybe deep or insightful differences between the Quran, the Torah,

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:09.800
and the Bible? Well, like I said, so you've got the original revelations of those scriptures,

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:13.560
but there are so many versions of those scriptures and there are times throughout history where

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:17.160
there have been changes just from an objective perspective, right?

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:26.440
What is the original scripture that was given to Moses, peace be upon him, and what was initially

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:34.440
communicated to Jesus, peace be upon him. Those things have changed over time. However, there's

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:40.280
still some truth that remains even in those scriptures. And so there are still things that

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:47.000
line up, especially with the Old Testament and Islam, there are still many things that line up

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:53.000
between the two, the Bible as well, the New Testament. Now, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:59.080
it's different because these are not original scriptures. These are testimonies that were

01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:05.480
obviously collected around the entire phenomenon of the coming of Christ, but the authors themselves,

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:11.960
the biographies, the documentation even of those original testimonies and gospels, what made the

01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:16.120
cut in terms of being included within the gospels and what didn't, because there are many gospels

01:58:16.120 --> 01:58:21.160
at the time in that sense, is different from what we believe was scripture communicated to Jesus,

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:31.560
peace be upon him. The Quran is different in several ways, but it confirms what came before it,

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.040
but it's the document and preserved word of God to be recited throughout time.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:42.520
So it confirms much of what came before it, and it resides amongst us and within us

01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:51.560
for the rest of time. And through it, we honor those revelations that came through the prophets

01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:57.720
of old, because the essence, the core of what came through those revelations is preserved in

01:58:57.720 --> 01:59:03.960
the Quran and with us. I tell people this all the time that the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him,

01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:12.840
introduced Jesus, peace be upon him, and even Moses, peace be upon him, to much of the world.

01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:19.000
There are Muslims around the world that are named Isa, that are named Jesus. There are Muslims

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.840
around the world that are named Ibrahim, Abraham, Muslims around the world named Musa,

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:28.280
and they learned of these figures through the revelation that came to the prophet Muhammad,

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:36.280
peace be upon him, Noah, Maryam, one of the most popular names in Islam, Mary, peace be upon her,

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:42.040
whole chapter in the Quran named after Maryam, which is actually what I was reciting in the

01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:46.120
prayer was the chapter of Maryam, the chapter of the story of Mary, peace be upon her.

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:54.280
The Quran contains the stories, it contains legislation and law, but primarily it was

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:58.760
revealed over 23 years. It actually was coming in accordance with some of the events that were

01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:04.280
unfolding in the life of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. The first 13 years of that

02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:10.200
was primarily belief in God, belief in the hereafter, and things that surrounded the

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:17.720
core creed of Islam. And then legislation, law, stories of the prophets came down in accordance

02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:23.400
with the unfolding events, as well as prophesying some of the things that were to come and speaking

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:27.320
about some of the things that had just happened. And it is completed in the lifetime of the prophet

02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:31.240
Muhammad, peace be upon him, memorized and then communicated to generation after generation after

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.520
generation so that we have it in its pristine fashion.

02:00:34.600 --> 02:00:40.600
Now billions of people, just all across the world, all the different cultures, all

02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:49.160
memorizing the same words. One of the pillars, or maybe I should say one of the central practices

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:57.640
is the month of Ramadan. What is the importance of this month? What does the process of it entail

02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:03.640
also? So Islam has, I think it'd be good to maybe lay this out for people, the articles of faith in

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:07.320
the pillars of Islam. So the articles of faith, there are six articles of faith, and this kind

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:14.920
of lays the foundation for the creed of Islam. So belief in God, belief in the angels, belief in the

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:21.080
messages, belief in the messengers, belief in the day of judgment, and belief in divine decree.

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:29.000
So these are the six articles of faith. Belief in God, belief in the angels, belief in the messages

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.800
being the scriptures, belief in the messengers being the prophets, belief in the day of judgment

02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:39.880
and belief in divine decree. That's what you have to believe to be a Muslim. You have to believe in

02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:45.960
those six things, right? And then you go to the pillars of faith. The five pillars of faith

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:53.720
are sort of, or they make up the structure of those articles of faith, the practice of the Muslim.

02:01:53.720 --> 02:02:02.040
So to be a Muslim, you testify that there's only one God worthy of worship and unconditional

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:06.680
obedience. And then you testify that Muhammad is the final messenger of God. That's the first

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:11.080
pillar. It's the actual testimony entering into Islam. Then it's the five daily prayers,

02:02:11.720 --> 02:02:18.440
practicing the five daily prayers, at least as a bare minimum obligation, the mandatory charity,

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:24.360
which is called the zakat, that Muslims have to give at least 2.5% of their retained earnings

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:30.760
to specific categories of charity. Then it is the fasting of the month of Ramadan,

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:36.040
the mandatory fasting of the month of Ramadan. And then it's the Hajj, if you can do so,

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:39.800
the pilgrimage, if you can do so once in your lifetime. So those are the five pillars of Islam.

02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:47.240
So Ramadan is a month in which Muslims engage in this incredible spiritual bootcamp.

02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.760
Now, fasting can mean different things to different people. When we fast, we fast from before

02:02:54.760 --> 02:03:02.680
sunrise to sunset for an entire month, and there's no food or water, period, and no intimacy as well.

02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:08.040
So you would abstain from intimacy with your spouse as well in that time. No food or water,

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:14.200
no bread, no nothing. You don't eat or drink, even if you live in Texas, where you get these

02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:18.760
long hot days in the summer. And of course, Islam is on a lunar calendar, so it moves every

02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:28.760
year, about 10 days earlier. During that time, you restrict the intake to the body,

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:34.600
so that you can focus on the intake of the soul. So instead of being focused on consumption,

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:40.120
constant consumption, you are consuming words of remembrance, words of prayer. You're to be

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:44.200
hyper-conscious of not doing anything that would spiritually validate your fast,

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:48.200
just as you would physically. So just like you won't eat or drink, you certainly won't engage

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:54.200
in sin, though you shouldn't engage in sins throughout the year. But you're not going to

02:03:54.200 --> 02:04:01.240
speak words of evil. You're not going to gossip or slander. You try to fast with your eyes,

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:07.960
not look at things that are not praiseworthy. So you try to engage in a wholesome act of

02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:15.320
disciplining yourself with the consciousness of God, but then channel that into engaging the

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.840
soul instead, exercising the soul instead. And what you'll find with Muslims and this act of

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:24.840
God-consciousness, where they reduce the consumption, is they become far more grateful

02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.520
for the blessings of God, because throughout our lives, we just take sips of water, we eat what we

02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:35.160
can, we snack. When you're abstaining from that, you become so much more grateful for that sip of

02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:39.880
water, so much more grateful for that bite of food, so much more aware of the one who provided

02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:43.720
those blessings to you, so much more aware of those that don't have the same access to those

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:48.680
blessings that you have. So you also develop a sense of empathy for the poor that don't have

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:54.360
access to those blessings on a regular basis that can't help but fast. And on top of that, again,

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.720
spiritually, you are engaged in extra reading. At that time, people are listening to more lectures.

02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:08.200
People are engaged in extra acts of devotion, extra acts of charity. Muslims are most charitable

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:13.320
in the month of Ramadan, so you just feel great. And it's hard to explain to someone that doesn't

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:18.360
do it, because it sounds like torture to people, right? What in the world are you doing, you know,

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.800
four o'clock on a hot Texas day, not eating or drinking, you're probably dehydrated and cranky,

02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:29.080
have a caffeine headache, and you probably can't wait for this month to be over. But in reality,

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:34.200
you talk to Muslims, their favorite time of the year is Ramadan. You feel amazing. You feel

02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:39.080
absolutely incredible, because you taste a different type of consumption. You feed your soul

02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:47.800
for a change. And in that process, you connect with God in a way that you simply could not without

02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:52.520
the distractions of the day to day throughout the year. Now, it's good that it's one month of the

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:58.840
year because it's honestly physically taxing, right? So it gives you a chance to experience

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:03.400
it for that one month, but then you're encouraged to fast a few days of the year as well outside of

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:10.360
the month of Ramadan to keep that connection. What are the hardest parts that maybe for people

02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:21.560
outside of the Muslim faith, yeah, would be curious about? Well, I think the hardest part is

02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:25.320
physically. Is it physical or is it the spiritual?

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:34.360
So as Ramadan goes on, your acts of worship increase. So in the last 10 nights of Ramadan,

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:41.560
there is an intense period of prayer throughout the night. So every night in Ramadan, we have

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:45.480
something called the Tarawih prayers. The Tarawih prayers are about an hour, hour and a half of

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:49.800
prayer outside of the five daily prayers. So the mosques are packed every night in Ramadan.

02:06:50.680 --> 02:06:55.960
The last 10 nights of Ramadan, people will engage in prayer throughout the entire night.

02:06:55.960 --> 02:07:00.200
So the only sleep that you're probably getting is actually a couple of hours in the morning

02:07:00.200 --> 02:07:06.760
before you go to work. So it's everything sort of put together, the disruption of schedule,

02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:13.880
the disruption of diet, the physically exerting yourself. But the way you feel

02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:23.320
is unmatched. I mean, you feel so fulfilled through that deprivation. And it's actually

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:27.640
the point, you know, it all ties back together when you talk about even tests and trials,

02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:32.600
that God does not deprive us of anything except that he gives us something greater

02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:38.440
in return. And you do not deprive yourself of anything for the sake of God, except that he

02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:43.960
gives you something greater in return. And so fasting is an exercise and patience that unlocks

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:47.640
an infinite sense of gratitude and a greater connection to God.

02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:53.240
So many people predict that Islam will surpass Christianity as the largest religion

02:07:53.960 --> 02:08:00.840
by the end of the century, by the number of its adherents and practitioners. What responsibility

02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:06.040
does that play some people like you, who is a religious leader, who is somebody who teaches,

02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:10.200
who grows, who cares for the community, for the Muslim community, but actually for all people?

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:15.640
Well, I think what that means is that we have a responsibility to

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:25.240
teach and live our faith in the most beautiful of ways that its values and ideals are not just

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:31.560
expressed by you, but experienced by everyone around you. And so what I often teach my community

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:37.960
is that look at the Muslims in the area, what are your neighbors experiencing of you? What are

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:44.360
people experiencing of you? And there's statistics to Muslims being the most charitable communities

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:49.800
in America. We're a community of great service, a community of volunteer, a community that greatly

02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:55.080
enriches the world around us. I think that oftentimes people forget the history of Muslims

02:08:56.040 --> 02:09:00.040
being at the forefront of contributing in the areas of medicine and science and

02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:05.800
all sorts of ways, education, really changing the world through their commitment to faith.

02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:15.240
But on a deeply personal level, it's important for us to be representatives

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:21.240
of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, in a way that makes Islamophobia impossible.

02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:28.120
I tell people this, that it's very hard. You mentioned the United States of Hate,

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:35.080
the documentary and the one man, the protester who met me and sort of changed his worldview.

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:42.680
It's very hard for people to believe what they hear about Islam if they see you live it.

02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:50.040
Now, that does not excuse bigotry. That doesn't excuse the prejudice against Muslims. But it's

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:57.160
important for us to sort of take it as a responsibility as Muslims to channel our

02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:02.760
faith in the most beautiful of ways. God describes faith in the Quran, in the chapter of Abraham,

02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:08.920
peace be upon him, as a tree with firm foundations. The firm foundation being the testimony of faith,

02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:13.400
the oneness of God, so the tree of monotheism with firm foundations, and then branches high in the

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:20.200
sky, providing shade to everything and everyone around you and producing fruit at all times.

02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:26.920
The tree of faith of a Muslim is not seasonal, so you should be producing with your faith at

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:33.960
all times good works and things that people can actually experience. I think that Muslims have

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:39.480
historically contributed to the world around them. I think that Muslims today are still contributing

02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:47.400
to the world around them, but I think that we can never do enough of holding ourselves accountable

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:53.400
to the message that we hold dear to our hearts and trying to be the best representatives of

02:10:53.400 --> 02:11:01.480
that message and of that messenger to the world around us. So not only are you a religious leader

02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:06.920
in the Muslim community, but you have a lot of friends who are from different religions.

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:15.640
You have a lot of Jewish friends, as we've talked about a lot offline, and we'll probably hopefully

02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:22.520
get a chance to talk to as well here. But on that topic, let me bring up another tragic event that

02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.800
was just a little bit less than a year ago in this very community here in Dallas.

02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:33.960
There was a synagogue hostage crisis. Can you describe what happened and what was your experience

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:40.440
like through it and afterwards and what were the bad things you saw and what are the good things

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:49.480
you saw in the community? The Colleyville synagogue situation, it's kind of surreal that we're coming

02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:55.080
up on a year of that, but I'll actually tell you exactly what happened that morning. I was out with

02:11:55.080 --> 02:12:02.200
the family and that morning, I kid you not, that very morning I was telling my kids the story of

02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:07.640
Muhammad Ali talking that man out of committing suicide off the roof and I showed them the YouTube

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.360
video. My wife pulled it up on her phone. Kids were sitting in the back seat. We talked about that

02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:20.280
video and talked about that importance of helping people. We also went to visit a loved one in the

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.600
cemetery that day and we went to breakfast. So we're out as a family that day, right? And there's

02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:30.680
a lot of meaning that's sort of coming together for us and a lot of discussion, deep discussion

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:36.200
we're having as a family. And then some of our community groups, we get this message that there

02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:44.760
is a synagogue that's been taken hostage, a rabbi and his congregation taken as hostages and

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:52.040
go to this Facebook link and it was the feed of the synagogue and you could hear the gunman

02:12:52.040 --> 02:13:00.840
shouting. And it became apparent very early on that it was a man that was claiming to be Muslim

02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:07.400
that was holding them hostage. Now, all these synagogue massacres, all these places of worship

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:13.400
were not attacked by Muslims, right? This is a different type of situation, but

02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:22.120
my first instinct was like all that happened this morning was not random.

02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:26.840
So I told my wife and I told my kids, I'm going to go down there.

02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:34.120
Ah, it's a Colleyville. She was very supportive. Obviously there was a moment of shock

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:39.880
and like kids were like, wait, what? And I said, look, remember what we talked about this morning?

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:46.680
We can't be indifferent to the stuff. We still go back and revisit that day.

02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:50.280
You know, like it's crazy how it was all falling into place. It's not an accident, right?

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.520
So I dropped them off at home and I started to drive to Colleyville.

02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:02.360
I called the Irving police department and I asked them to call the Colleyville police department

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.720
so that they could kind of know that I'm coming down there. I called some of the faith leaders

02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:14.360
in the community to see if they could put me in touch with those on the ground so that I

02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:20.520
wouldn't get shot when I showed up there. And eventually I had to wait outside until

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:25.800
they got clearance to come through and to just offer whatever support I could, pastoral support,

02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:33.000
support with trying to free the hostages of the synagogue at the time. It was operating out of a

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:41.160
church right across the street from the synagogue. A day long just wondering, you know, what was

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:47.560
going to happen. Looking at the family of the rabbi at the time, wondering what was going to

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:55.560
happen and trying to just be as supportive as I possibly could at that time. Thankfully,

02:14:56.360 --> 02:15:06.200
they all got out in the evening. And I think that, you know, looking back on that day,

02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:11.480
like my wife actually asked me, she said, would you have done it differently? And I said, no,

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:16.840
I really wouldn't because I think that things happen sometimes. You've got to act on your

02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:21.720
good instincts sometimes, right? When you talk about like being calculated, I think sometimes

02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:26.680
we're calculated when we shouldn't be. And that's when that good instinct comes in,

02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:32.920
where you're called to do something else. What did it feel like to be a Muslim in a situation like

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:40.680
that? I mean, were you a human being? Were you a religious practitioner?

02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:45.880
Yeah. See, I can't separate anything about myself in that situation, right? So

02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:51.960
when I had to pray, I had to pray to help people out, to give people words of comfort,

02:15:52.600 --> 02:16:01.160
to try to appeal to the senses of whoever I could at the time. I didn't see myself as like

02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:10.600
a guy trying to show a particular part of Islam there. I just saw myself as someone that was

02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:15.560
trying to help a family get their husband and father back, right? And so it was more of just

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:21.240
like that part of me was there. You know, you can kind of see yourself, right? This is the irony of

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:27.800
it. When Christ Church in New Zealand happened, that was kind of our worst nightmare as Texas

02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:32.280
Muslims because we've had armed groups in front of our mosques threatening to do what that man

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:39.880
did in Christ Church. And so when you see a wife and kids wondering if they're going to get their

02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:46.520
dad back, you kind of see yourself there. And so I just saw myself in that situation. What would I

02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:50.280
want people to be doing for me in that moment? What would I want people to be telling my family

02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:55.480
in that moment? So that's really where I went to and that's really where I dug into. And I prayed

02:16:55.480 --> 02:17:02.200
a lot that day, a lot, a lot for the right words, for the right actions, what I could do to just help.

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:11.000
What are the lessons now a year later that you take away from that day and the days?

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:17.720
So many lessons. Just don't be indifferent. Don't be indifferent to the suffering around you or even

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:22.760
that's distant from you because it's somehow related to you. So just don't be indifferent.

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:29.080
So you're proud that you stepped up and you went there and then...

02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:38.840
Yeah, look, I don't think I did much. I'm being really honest. This is not me trying to be humble

02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:47.240
here. I don't think I did much. I think I did what I was called to do. I wish that it never

02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:53.560
happened as a whole, but I'm glad that the relationships that have been built over time

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:58.360
came into being in that day. We could call upon people that we knew, call upon each other,

02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:03.080
and as a community, really come together. Dallas has been through a lot, a lot of pain,

02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:09.000
but we've come together through a lot of pain as well. So it's kind of one of those things

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:15.000
where we're united in our pain. When you suffer together, you build certain bonds together.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:20.440
So Dallas has been through a lot as a community, but we've come together through a lot as a

02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:27.480
community. Yeah, the thing about violence and war, it destroys, it causes so much suffering,

02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.880
but it also sort of brings out some of the best aspects of human nature and unites people.

02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:36.440
It's an interesting way how our human civilization functions.

02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:39.960
Well, that's the beauty that you don't just want to see, but you also want to be.

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:47.240
We're living in a climate where there's a lot of that, right? So how do you actually

02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:59.320
get through that and actually not allow yourself to succumb to that and be another voice in that

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:07.480
polarization? It seems that throughout history and still in the world today,

02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:16.200
religion has been a source of a lot of polarization, a lot of conflict, even war.

02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:21.720
Why do you think that is? Listen, I think at the essence of it

02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:29.720
is always some sort of political instability that leaves behind a brutalized population

02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:33.240
and vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:41.720
As I said, in the 20th century, with the bloodiest century that we've had to date,

02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:46.600
where does religion fall on any of that? Where does religion fall on the isms?

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:53.000
Where does religion fall in the world wars? Where does religion fall in much of that?

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:56.840
Even when we talk about things like the Crusades, remove the Islamic framing,

02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:02.920
the Crusades. The Crusades, were they really about religion? The Mongols and the destruction

02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:10.200
of the Mongols. Was it about religion? Myanmar and the Rohingya today, is it about Buddhism?

02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:18.760
So, I think that these are essentially political issues, political causes where you have people

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:26.680
that rise up and that use religion to disguise things that are far, far, far from religion.

02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:30.280
And if you want to manipulate a religious scripture, you could turn any book,

02:20:31.240 --> 02:20:37.000
any scripture into a violent scripture if you have a violent aim. So, I think that that's where you

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:45.880
find people manipulating verses, manipulating religion, to justify sick ideologies that are

02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:52.920
based and thrive in political instability. So, these are fundamentally political geopolitical

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:57.640
conflicts, not religious conflicts. Absolutely. Look, when you talk about a group like ISIS,

02:20:59.080 --> 02:21:01.880
Islam has been in Iraq for a very, very long time.

02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:10.040
Iraq has been bombed by now five consecutive presidents, or four. It's been bombed into the

02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:17.000
Stone Ages. There is no political infrastructure. It's devastation and destruction and desperation

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:22.920
as a result of that. Many of the old Saddam loyalists and Saddam's regime was a secularist

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:30.040
regime, are now heads of ISIS, right? It just moved into that. When you create that type of chaos,

02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:37.560
you generate an environment where groups like ISIS are bound to rise out of.

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:44.120
And so, Islam did not cause this. People didn't wake up in Iraq one day and say,

02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:47.080
hey, let's create a group called ISIS because Islam tells us to.

02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:58.520
Right? Iraq was bombed into this place. And we have to, not just free religion from

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:06.120
the responsibility, from having to bear the responsibility of much of the hatred and violence,

02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:14.360
but we have to interrogate the political instability that was caused, where we justified

02:22:14.520 --> 02:22:21.480
as Americans. These are our taxpayer dollars, where we justified with what was done in Iraq.

02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:27.640
Do we even know what was done in Iraq and Afghanistan? These drones that drop using

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:36.600
our tax dollars under Democratic and Republican regimes and kill thousands of innocent people

02:22:36.600 --> 02:22:42.520
in weddings in Yemen and Somalia, are these justified? And when you think about dehumanization,

02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:48.760
can the average American name a single victim of the Iraq War? Is there a picture that comes

02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:52.600
to your mind? Is there a person? Absolutely not, because that's the dehumanization.

02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:59.480
Now, I often talk about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., his progression as a faith leader in America,

02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:04.760
as a political leader in America. Dr. King was deeply unpopular when he took his stand on Vietnam,

02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:11.560
and he mentions how first, he had to see Vietnam as a political leader in America.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:17.560
Vietnam through the lens of the soldiers, because many of the soldiers that were lost,

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:22.840
American soldiers. That was a crime that they were sent to fight a war that they should not

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:28.840
have been sent to fight, and there was an injustice that was done towards them. He said, but things

02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:33.720
really changed when he started to see it from the other side of the bullet, when he started to see

02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:40.760
the world through Vietnam, through the Vietnamese child. And that's where he resorted to breaking

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:46.280
the silence. That's where he changed his tune, because we dehumanize our victims so much that

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:53.640
they're not even relevant to our discourse until they become able villains to our story. And then

02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:58.520
now they're attacking us because they hate us. Now they're blowing us up because they hate us.

02:23:58.520 --> 02:24:05.000
Their religion tells them to do this to us. What have we allowed to be done to them using our tax

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:13.240
dollars in our name, right? So I think that we have to interrogate the political chaos that was

02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:22.760
caused, not just free religion from the groups that were created, but what was done to those

02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:29.640
countries and what continues to be done in many of these places. Yeah, when the pride that people

02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:35.000
had about America where everybody came together after 9-11 and there was all the American flags,

02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:44.440
that was beautiful to see, but then you have to transfer that. And I wish all of us Americans

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:49.640
could go and see the daughters that would lose their parents, the parents that would lose their

02:24:49.640 --> 02:24:57.000
daughters and sons because bombs dropped, the thousands, the tens of thousands of civilians

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:05.480
that died in Afghanistan and in Iraq because of the decisions made in the name of politics.

02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:11.240
Like if we just met those families and if we empathize with them and just put ourselves in

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:20.120
their place, it's impossible not to feel hate for America, for everybody. I visited Ukraine and

02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:27.640
spoke to a lot of Ukrainians and they said, you know, there's loved ones that are Russians

02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:34.840
before the war, but now all they have is hate. And if you ask many of them, will they ever forgive,

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:43.000
not the regime, not the soldiers, will they ever forgive Russians? Many of them say never.

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:48.840
And that never feels like it's a generational never.

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:57.400
I mean, look, you think about this, you know, if your grandparents were wiped out in a drone

02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.120
attack, your parents, your brothers, your sisters, all of your loved ones, and you're missing a leg

02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:07.480
in an eye, and the world does not take you into consideration, you'll never be seen or considered

02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:12.840
in the halls of Congress or discussed. What are you going to grow up with, right?

02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:18.680
But the thing is, is that we should not be speaking about this only from the standpoint of,

02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:24.360
oh, shoot, they're going to grow up and hate us. We should be thinking about what was done to them

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:30.680
and hate that, despise that, that it's ugly. You see, when people carry out a terrorist attack,

02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:36.920
they're not considering the lives of the civilians in these places. So those that

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:42.600
perpetrate the 9-11 attacks are not seeing the thousands of people that they killed,

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:45.960
the human beings, the lives, many of whom are Muslim, by the way. Actually, no,

02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.360
one of them was a very active Muslim in the Islamic circle of North America.

02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:58.600
I mean, they didn't see those stories, right? When you drop a bomb on this many people,

02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:04.520
when you drone people and you say, oops, collateral damage, we were looking for one person,

02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:11.080
killed 40 people, and there's no count, no names, nothing that can be recalled

02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:16.680
in the American memory. That's a problem, a fundamental issue with how we treat the rest

02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:25.160
of the world, right? So I'm an American. I think that I'm responsible to the extent that I have

02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:31.960
to critique these policies and I have to try to challenge America to deal with the world differently.

02:27:33.080 --> 02:27:40.520
And when I go overseas, when I'm around Muslims in the Muslim world, right, in the Middle East

02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:49.240
and in the Muslim world, I'm speaking as a Palestinian American Muslim who grew up in

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:54.840
South Louisiana. I've got a complex background here, right? A lot of experiences here that

02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:03.720
I'm grateful for because they all contribute to who I am and what I know. I think they're all

02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:10.360
enriching. I wouldn't relinquish the Palestinian part. I wouldn't relinquish the American part,

02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:16.360
and I certainly wouldn't relinquish the Muslim part. But it's helping people consider

02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:22.520
what they're not seeing. And when you can dehumanize entire groups of people to where

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:28.520
you can reduce them to chalk casualty counts and not be able to recall a single story,

02:28:29.480 --> 02:28:35.720
then you have to take a step back and ask yourself, what are we becoming, right? What are we becoming?

02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:42.280
Not a single victim of Afghanistan or Iraq. Millions of people, not a single person,

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:46.440
a single person, can the average American conjure in their head.

02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:53.240
If you apply this to a very difficult topic of Israel and Palestine,

02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:59.880
speaking of which, right, you have been critical of the policies of the state of Israel. But

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.600
as we've mentioned, very supportive of Jewish people. You have a lot of friends, rabbis and

02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.320
Jews in general here in Dallas and across the world.

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.560
What is the difference to you in that part of the world between politics and religion?

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:23.640
So in this case, Zionism and Judaism, both terms broadly defined.

02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:26.600
Both terms broadly defined.

02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:33.240
So I say that because those terms, there's technical definitions and there's how they're

02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:37.880
popularly used. And so you have to be kind of, just like we said with Islamophobia,

02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:45.400
these terms are, they become politicized. So just generally speaking, I think Zionism

02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:51.240
has to do with politics and Judaism has to do with religion.

02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:54.120
It's a great complexity like to a lot of people like, wait a minute,

02:29:54.680 --> 02:29:59.480
right? And you got to take a step back and wonder why there are so many Zionist anti-Semites in

02:29:59.480 --> 02:30:07.400
America. And there are so many anti-Zionists who are far from being anti-Semites, anti-Zionism

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:11.560
that are opposed to the ideology, that are opposed to the implications of it.

02:30:12.600 --> 02:30:18.120
Look, I think that it's fundamentally secular. When you think about it, there is an

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:27.000
ethnosupremacism. There is, I am the child of Palestinians that were forcibly displaced

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.080
from their land. I've never been able to go to where my parents, my grandparents are from.

02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:36.120
I've never been able to see that land. I've never been able to access that. I have cousins

02:30:36.120 --> 02:30:40.680
that I'll never be, well, I shouldn't say never, inshallah, God willing, I will meet them,

02:30:40.680 --> 02:30:45.560
but that I've only been able to speak through a phone, FaceTime, Zoom.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:56.440
I think that it's important for us to separate criticism of Israel's policies

02:30:57.480 --> 02:31:00.360
from anti-Semitism. In fact, it's an injustice.

02:31:01.880 --> 02:31:10.200
It cheapens anti-Semitism when you throw every person who is opposed to Zionism or opposed to

02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:16.360
Israel's policies in the bucket of being anti-Semites. It's wrong. It cheapens it.

02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:22.920
It doesn't do justice to it. And I think it's important for us to have a meaningful conversation

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:29.560
about America's support for Israel. Listen, there are terms that are important here,

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:33.960
so I'm going to throw out these big terms, right? Apartheid, occupation,

02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:42.600
ethnic cleansing. These are terms that are legal terms. There are objective thresholds here

02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:51.960
for apartheid, occupation, ethnic cleansing. The threshold of apartheid has been crossed

02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:58.280
according to the most respectable human rights organizations in the world. These are the

02:31:58.280 --> 02:32:03.640
organizations that you will champion and that you will use in every single other conflict to

02:32:03.640 --> 02:32:08.760
justify your own policies, but that threshold of apartheid has been passed. According to Human

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:13.080
Rights Watch, according to Amnesty International, according to the Harvard Law Review, the threshold

02:32:13.080 --> 02:32:17.720
of apartheid has been crossed. There's a legal terminology there, two sets of laws for two

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:24.600
separate people. You have a displaced people that are forcibly being removed, that are being

02:32:24.600 --> 02:32:32.680
treated differently, that are stateless, that are undergoing daily humiliation, that live behind an

02:32:32.680 --> 02:32:37.960
apartheid wall, that live under a different set of policies, that are routinely bombarded,

02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:43.640
that have lost their ability to free movement, that have lost their ability to access to basic

02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:49.160
necessities of human life. There are legal definitions here. I don't see how any objective

02:32:49.160 --> 02:32:54.760
human being can read those reports on apartheid and the threshold crossed for apartheid and walk

02:32:54.760 --> 02:32:57.800
away from that and say that this is just Jews and Muslims that don't like each other.

02:32:58.440 --> 02:33:04.760
There's a legal definition here, occupation. When Israel was created in 1948,

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:09.800
you will find many Jews who are opposed to Zionism, and I think this is important

02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:14.600
to talk to Jews who are opposed to Zionism, and there are many

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:22.440
that will say that we were told that it was a land without a people, for a people without a land.

02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:29.960
The problem with that was there were people there, our ancestors, 750,000 Palestinians

02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:36.920
expelled in the Nakba, and many Palestinians that have been removed and harassed and that are

02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:42.520
treated in horrific ways, and the occupation is expanding. It is an illegal occupation.

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:49.160
The settlements are still expanding, and the United States enables that occupation with its funding,

02:33:49.720 --> 02:33:57.480
with its unconditional support, unwavering support of Israel, and it does so in a way

02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:03.080
that completely undermines any of its claims to being a beacon of freedom in the world,

02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:09.160
because it is in plain sight now that the world can see what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah,

02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:12.200
what is happening in Jerusalem, what is happening with these expanding settlements,

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:17.000
everything that flies in the face of any claim to wanting a peaceful solution.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.800
The children in Gaza, when I talk about dehumanization, the children that were on

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.360
the face of the New York Times, which is historically one of the most anti-Palestinian

02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.640
newspapers in America, the faces of the children of Gaza,

02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:39.080
America and many parts of the world are now seeing it. We have been saying for a very long time,

02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.800
this is apartheid, this is an occupation, this is an injustice. The world needs to check it,

02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:50.120
hold it accountable. South Africa, which experienced apartheid, Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu,

02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:55.160
all of those that fought apartheid in South Africa, said that Palestinians are living

02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:00.040
under apartheid and that the same strategies that check apartheid in South Africa need to

02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:05.160
be used to hold Israel accountable for apartheid with the Palestinians.

02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:17.240
It is impossible for us as Palestinians to simply say that we should give up on this cause

02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:24.760
because all the odds are stacked against us. But when you have videos coming out of the Israeli

02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:32.600
Army spewing skunk water, skunk water, sewage water on worshippers leaving Al-Aqsa,

02:35:35.240 --> 02:35:41.720
far-right leaders now taking the government and the so-called only democracy in the Middle East

02:35:41.720 --> 02:35:46.840
prohibiting a Palestinian flag being raised anywhere around. American reporter,

02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:53.960
Abu Akla, Palestinian-American Christian reporter, Palestinian-American Christian reporter,

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:59.160
one of the most prominent journalists in the Middle East, shot in the face, plain sight,

02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:02.920
and all America could say was, all the American government could say was,

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:08.280
if it turns out that it is indeed Israel, that Israel is responsible for the death of

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:13.800
an American journalist, then we will hold them accountable. Nothing, not a peep.

02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:21.480
It was a shame to see that happen and it just solidified to us that whether it's a Democratic

02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:30.360
president or a Republican president, unfortunately, the support for Israel is enabling it to continue

02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:39.800
to wipe out the Palestinian population from its historic land. And so, we see that happening.

02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:47.480
And I'll say this as well. People ask me about the Abraham Accords. They say, you know, you are

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:52.600
talking about faith between, or you're talking about peace between communities of faith and

02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:55.720
protecting communities of faith. Why are you opposed to the Abraham Accords? I think that the

02:36:55.720 --> 02:37:00.920
name of Abraham should not be used. And I wrote an article called Why I Oppose the Abraham Accords.

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:06.440
The name of Abraham should not be used to justify arms deals that only further disenfranchise the

02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:12.360
abused population of the Palestinians. Where, you know, you have quote unquote Muslim regimes

02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:17.480
making peace with Israel and that's being used against the Palestinian people who are

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:21.880
only further disenfranchised from having a voice in their own fate

02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:29.800
for the sake of American arms deals and security and economic benefits. It's despicable. It's

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:35.800
repulsive. Talk to the people, speak to people on the ground there, see what's happening with your

02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:42.120
own two eyes and think about the injustice where our taxpayer dollars are being used

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:48.840
to suppress the people and what legally meets the definition by every objective standard of apartheid,

02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:53.640
of occupation, of ethnic cleansing, and it's ongoing and it's happening in real time.

02:37:53.640 --> 02:38:00.680
And it's becoming more blatant with a regime now that's unapologetic of even expressing

02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:07.160
what the policies have already done. And that is the removal of a people,

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:13.160
forcible removal of a people because the government knows that the United States

02:38:13.160 --> 02:38:19.800
support is unconditional. Do you have hope that Jews, Muslims, and Christians on this land will

02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:26.280
live in peace one day together, have a basic respect for each other's humanity?

02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:33.960
Look, this isn't a religious conflict. I think that's fundamentally one of the problems.

02:38:33.960 --> 02:38:36.760
So even the question is not the correct question.

02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:42.280
It's not the correct question. This is not a religious conflict. Yes, religion is invoked.

02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:52.120
Yes, there are religious elements, but there are many Jews that are opposed to what is happening

02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:58.600
right now towards the Palestinians, many. And I would recommend a serious discussion

02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:02.680
with even people whose perspectives have grown, Peter Beinert being an example,

02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:10.840
Rabbi Simone Zimmerman started, if not now. Beta Slim, an Israeli human rights organization

02:39:10.840 --> 02:39:14.600
that also classed it as apartheid recently. There are many Jews that are opposed to what

02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:19.000
is happening right now. Palestinians are also not exclusively a Muslim population.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:24.520
Sharina Baraklah was Christian. There are many Palestinian Christians that are also

02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:32.600
being denied entry into their historic churches and that are completely bewildered or absolutely

02:39:32.600 --> 02:39:40.760
lost in regards to why American evangelicals have this ironclad support for the occupation

02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:45.240
and have ignored the plight of Palestinian Christians. Of course, I believe Muslims,

02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:51.800
Christians, and Jews can coexist. Of course, I have hope because I have to have hope as a

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:57.400
person of faith. But as much hope as I have, I think there's a great sense of urgency for

02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:03.160
people to open their eyes, learn what's actually happening on the ground, read the reports,

02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:12.280
stop letting these commentators and these companies that are able to generate propaganda

02:40:13.240 --> 02:40:19.080
and own the narrative. There are objective standards here. There are objective measures

02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:24.520
of oppression that need to be considered here. What's happening to Gaza is one of the greatest

02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:30.920
atrocities of our time. Learn about it. I'd tell people to just watch the Vice documentaries,

02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:35.240
for example, the mini documentaries. I'd send them to you as well, Inside the Battle for Jerusalem.

02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:44.680
Think about it. A guy from Long Island, New York, can fly to Israel, fly into Tel Aviv,

02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.680
and walk into a home that's been occupied by families for generations and throw the people

02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:56.200
out under the full protection of the military there and spit on them, historic homes.

02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:00.600
When people come up to me and say, we're opposed to Islamophobia,

02:41:01.160 --> 02:41:05.560
we're opposed to Islamophobia, but they support that? I tell you, you're not opposed to

02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.760
Islamophobia. How can you be opposed to Islamophobia when you traffic in the same framings

02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:20.200
and dehumanization that enables the viciousness towards Muslims here and Palestinians over there

02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:25.240
that they do not deserve to be treated like equal human beings, like full human beings,

02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:31.320
and that based on historic claims, a guy can fly from New York into a historic neighborhood in

02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:36.760
Jerusalem and kick out generational families with military guns next to them. What does that sound

02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:43.640
like? How is that normal? I think that if people take the time to read, people take the time to

02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:51.000
investigate, then they come to this conclusion themselves that this is unacceptable and that you

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:56.360
can't put, and this is one of the problems with the framing of Israel-Palestine, is that you're

02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:02.360
equating occupier and occupied. You're equating the two sides of the conflict, and it's not a

02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:08.680
conflict, it's an occupation. There is such a disparity of power here that you cannot equate

02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:16.120
the two sides. Malcolm X would say, you clip the bird's wing and then blame it for not flying as

02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:23.480
high as you do. You can't do that to a people and just equate them with their occupier. It's

02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:31.240
an atrocity. It requires us to challenge it, and I'm hopeful at the current movement of Muslims,

02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:36.360
Christians, and Jews and people of all faiths that are saying enough is enough, that thresholds have

02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:45.640
been crossed here, that this is an atrocity that cannot continue. This is very personal to me

02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:51.880
because this is happening now. What I anticipate, and this is what America did, this is what Nelson

02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:57.320
Mandela actually predicted with the United States. What I anticipate is that 10 years from now,

02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:03.400
20 years from now, every American will say, how could we have supported this, and this was terrible,

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:12.120
and will pay symbolic homage to the Palestinian cause. But there are people now that are clinging

02:43:12.120 --> 02:43:18.280
on for dear life, access to their places of worship, access to their generational homes.

02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:23.640
Right now, there are children that are in detention and there's a bill in Congress.

02:43:26.680 --> 02:43:34.120
Wherever you stand on this issue, child detainment, child detention should be a red line.

02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:39.640
Congresswoman Betty McCollum has put this bill on the floor of Congress. She can't even get that

02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:50.760
passed. Just to at least censure child detainment by the IDF. So people need to look into this

02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:59.000
deeper. They need to consider the human element of this and consider the urgency of it as well.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.560
With this new regime, it's only going to, unfortunately, get much worse in the immediate

02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:05.320
term, and so we have to do something about it.

02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:12.040
If I may ask you for some advice for a reason that I'll explain maybe in a little bit,

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:19.240
or maybe I should just explain now, which is I think because you've talked about Islamophobia,

02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:24.840
because you've been at the center of so many catastrophic events, because you sort of jump

02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:31.960
into the fire to try to help people, you've been attacked a lot. Just in general, you've been under

02:44:31.960 --> 02:44:37.880
stress. It's just you're not immune to stress. So a part of me wants to ask

02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:46.520
just how psychologically difficult it's been and where you draw strength, and would you advise

02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:54.600
if the opportunity is there for a person like me, for a silly kid in a suit, to go to that

02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:00.040
part of the world and take seriously conversations? I would divide it into two categories. There's

02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:07.960
leaders and there's people. The leaders are sort of these political entities that have their

02:45:07.960 --> 02:45:13.720
interests, but they also have power, and they want to hold on to power. And then people are just

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:22.520
regular people that have families that just want to have basic rights and freedoms and continue

02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:28.600
to love their families to pursue different jobs and careers and lives that they can flourish and

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:35.080
so on. Those are very kind of different dynamics at play. And if given the opportunity to speak to

02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:42.920
leaders for me, would you advise I do it or not? And when I say leaders, I mean leaders that

02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:53.880
would make the case, the pro-Zionist case and the anti-Zionist case. And in both cases, I would

02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:57.640
make it a very challenging conversation for both of them. Unlike today,

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:03.720
our conversation today, you're an inspiring, incredible person. I'm a huge fan of yours.

02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:09.000
You spread so much love to the Muslim community here, to the Jewish community, just everybody

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:17.640
loves you. Not everybody. Yes, that's true. Not everybody. That's true. But a lot of people love

02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:23.560
you. Yes, but this was kind of an inspiring and a positive conversation. It wasn't very challenging

02:46:24.840 --> 02:46:29.160
although we did touch challenging topics and you did exceptionally well there.

02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.240
But I would do very challenging conversation with those leaders in that part of the world.

02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:39.240
Is that a bad idea? All right. Well, let me tell you from now, first and foremost, the first part

02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:45.160
because I don't want to lose the first part of your conversation. Is it psychologically stressful?

02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:57.480
Very, very. But when you're a person of faith and you believe that

02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:04.920
good work will always be rewarded and that doing the right thing will always be rewarded eventually,

02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:13.720
you're able to weather that storm quite a bit. So your wife told you.

02:47:14.680 --> 02:47:21.000
Well, that's the second thing I was going to mention is honestly a supportive family.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:27.240
My dad's 80 man and he's been through a lot. He was born in 1943, five years before Israel was

02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:33.080
even created. He was born in Palestine. He's suffered displacement. He has been around the

02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:39.000
world and somehow built himself up to be a distinguished professor of chemistry, an author,

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:46.840
an inventor, grew up taking on some of the most difficult challenges and was just always a man of

02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:51.560
principle. I always admired my dad being a man of principle and he just tells me, man, stay the

02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.560
course, stay the course. Don't be afraid. Don't back down. I have a supportive family. I have a

02:47:55.560 --> 02:48:00.680
supportive wife. I've got supportive kids. So I have amazing people around me that keep me grounded

02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:07.160
for sure. And ultimately, obviously faith. And also I'll say this slander doesn't stand.

02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:08.600
What do you mean by that?

02:48:09.160 --> 02:48:12.680
When people slander you and it kind of comes with the territory of a public figure,

02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.840
it's not going to stand throughout time because eventually any sincere person will find the truth

02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:24.680
and the only people that will regurgitate that will continue to do so. So when I get portrayed as

02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:32.840
an anti-Semite because of my strong takes on Israel and challenging Israel and I will continue

02:48:32.840 --> 02:48:38.280
to do so, it takes just people in doubt. She's like, we know him. What are you talking about?

02:48:39.640 --> 02:48:43.080
So slander doesn't stand, at least with the people that are important to you.

02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.600
It might reside on the internet. It might have great rankings and

02:48:47.240 --> 02:48:52.600
social media bots that give attraction. But is that psychologically difficult to you to have that?

02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:58.360
Yes, it is difficult. It's very difficult and it's hurtful, especially when it comes from

02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:04.680
quarters that you would hope that it doesn't come from. But you take a step back, you

02:49:06.040 --> 02:49:10.760
reevaluate, you lean into your faith and you lean on the people that are closest to you and then

02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:16.840
you keep going. You learn the lessons. Could I be doing something better? Could I be doing

02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.040
something different? Could I be saying something better? Could I be saying something different?

02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:26.920
Are the noble causes that I want to achieve? Am I doing justice by those causes? How do I

02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:33.160
grow out of this? You become wiser through these things as well. The second part of your question

02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:39.080
though about what you should do, if you're going to talk to people, talk to people from a place of

02:49:39.080 --> 02:49:44.280
inquiry. I would say talk to people more so than leaders and especially some of those who have

02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:51.080
been erased from the media commentary. Benjamin Netanyahu gets a lot of air time here in the

02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:58.200
United States. He's well-spoken. He speaks perfect English. He's an American as well.

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:06.200
I would challenge him on some of the things that he has said and done. He has an ongoing

02:50:06.200 --> 02:50:13.640
corruption case. I think he's a fascist. I think that he's a person who has done much evil. I think

02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:18.760
that he has a lot of blood on his hands and I think that one day he will be prosecuted for that.

02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:24.920
But I'd say talk to people on the ground and people that have been erased. Talk to the families

02:50:24.920 --> 02:50:28.520
that are being displaced, Sheikh Jarrah. I don't care about the political leadership. I'd much

02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:33.320
rather you talk to the people on the ground in East Jerusalem that have been displaced,

02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:39.000
the families. Talk to Palestinian Christians. Talk to the sister of Sharina Abu Akhla,

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:48.520
Lina Abu Akhla who was extremely disappointed and let down when Joe Biden went to the region

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:52.920
and did not take her calls, did not meet her, which was an absolutely disgraceful move.

02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:57.640
He should have met with her. She's the sister of an American journalist who was murdered in cold

02:50:57.640 --> 02:51:03.880
blood. Talk to Lina Abu Akhla. Talk to Mitri Rahib. Mitri, an interesting person, for example.

02:51:05.160 --> 02:51:09.720
He's the head of the Lutheran Church in Palestine. He comes to Dallas sometimes and talks about the

02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:14.200
plight of Palestinian Christians. I think if you're talking to people in leadership,

02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:20.360
obviously, there are some that will be able to represent themselves in English. Hanan Ashrawi

02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:24.280
is a very eloquent person, for example. I don't know if you're going to have any luck getting

02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:28.840
into Gaza, but I'll pray for you if you do. But obviously, if you want to talk to everybody,

02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:32.360
you got to talk to everybody, man. Well, and I also want to say,

02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:37.320
this is very important when you say whitewashing, because I've heard this a lot also with Ukraine

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:42.840
and Russia. There's an interesting line between whitewashing, which is something you definitely

02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:54.120
should not do, and a deep empathy for a large number of human beings. It's a really tricky

02:51:54.120 --> 02:51:59.640
line to walk. I also disagree with you about, well, I think, I don't know if it's a disagreement,

02:51:59.640 --> 02:52:05.720
but I think I disagree about leaders. I agree 100% that the most important people are the

02:52:05.720 --> 02:52:11.640
people on the ground. But I think those are extremely important people to understand,

02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:19.480
not just as leaders, but as human beings too. And in many cases, to have a challenging conversation,

02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:23.240
but from a place of empathy, from understanding a human being.

02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:30.520
So if you plan to talk to right-wing, the current leadership of Israel, my only request to you

02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:37.000
is talk to the victims themselves, not the Palestinian Authority. Talk to the victim.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:40.280
I know you want to, right? But the victims, yes.

02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:44.920
Talk to the victims themselves. Talk to those people that are being thrown out of their homes

02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:49.560
and subjected to the daily humiliation. Go to a checkpoint and walk through the checkpoint the

02:52:49.560 --> 02:52:53.080
way that a Palestinian walks through a checkpoint and tell me that's not apartheid. Walk through

02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:59.160
that checkpoint, crammed in in cages, and tell me it's not apartheid. So I think you're a very

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:04.360
sincere person. I think you're going to do your best. I'll be praying for you.

02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:09.640
Some of these things are harder than others, but yes, I feel like we're in the middle of a negotiation

02:53:09.640 --> 02:53:16.600
and we've come to a point where we're both agree. Not everyone deserves to be, but I think there's

02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:23.400
a great value and benefit. Let me say I agree with you in hearing people, even tyrants,

02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:29.000
hearing them so that you can properly deconstruct and decipher what you're hearing.

02:53:29.640 --> 02:53:33.320
But just think of the voices that don't get heard. And a lot of times what's been done to

02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:37.240
the Muslim world is, and what's being done right now in the name of the Abraham Accords,

02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:41.000
what's wrong with the Palestinians? The other Arabs are making peace with them.

02:53:41.560 --> 02:53:45.320
Let me tell you something. Those regimes that are signing onto the Abraham Accords, the people are

02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:51.480
not happy, but they're terrified of challenging those regimes. So if you go talk to the leaders

02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:57.240
of some of these countries that have signed onto the Abraham Accords and that are in some twisted

02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:09.640
way making this about religion and peace, you can greatly skew the narrative to where Palestinians

02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:14.600
are just an inherently disagreeable people that don't want peace. They just want to live in their

02:54:14.600 --> 02:54:21.560
homes. They just want to live as full equal human beings. They want the things that everybody wants

02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:26.280
and they're only being further disenfranchised in the name of peace now

02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:32.920
because voices are being amplified in the name of peace that are suffocating voices for justice.

02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:45.880
You said hope. As a man of faith, you have hope. What gives you hope about

02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:52.840
this part of the world and our world in general? When you look across and see so much conflict,

02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:55.480
so much division happening, what gives you hope?

02:54:57.080 --> 02:55:05.800
I think that if you look through history, we have been through points as a world where we almost

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:14.840
were not going to exist anymore. If you lived in the time of the Crusades, if you lived inside

02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:20.120
in some of these darker moments of history, World War I, World War II, you probably thought

02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:28.120
you weren't going to come out of this as a world. I have hope in God and I have hope

02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:33.720
that godly people, people that are devoted to God and people of righteousness,

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:43.640
can shift things with his help. I also believe that younger people, I hope they'll be different.

02:55:44.440 --> 02:55:52.040
I think younger people, hopefully, are using the word hope a lot. You might hear inshallah,

02:55:52.040 --> 02:56:01.800
God willing, will see the path that we're heading and will seek to disrupt

02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:08.840
this bleak trajectory and bring it back to something else.

02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:13.880
Here's the thing. We live in a time of hyperexposure. That hyperexposure could

02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:19.960
paralyze you or it could empower you. It could make you completely shut down and say,

02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:26.840
what's the point of even trying to help these people out? Why even talk about the Palestinians?

02:56:26.840 --> 02:56:32.440
Well, you got these people here, the Uyghurs, the Rohingya, you got what's happening in Honduras,

02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:40.760
Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, South America, Africa, Ethiopia, Somalia. It's so much and it

02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:50.040
can be overwhelming to a person who cares, but you ultimately realize that the difference that you

02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:56.520
can make can become a much greater difference, even if it's after your lifetime. I'll tell you

02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:00.920
actually a story that I remember the first time I went to Syria, Syrian refugee camps,

02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:10.120
and you deal with people in this deeply human way. For me, the most clarifying parts

02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:14.120
of the world are the refugee camps. It's where I feel the most clarity in life

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:20.360
about what I'm supposed to be doing in life. You go to the refugee camps and then after you're

02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:26.040
interacting with these people and maybe giving a few people some trailer homes and some food and

02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.760
something to sustain themselves, some coats and blankets, you drive out of the refugee camps

02:57:31.560 --> 02:57:35.640
back to where you're staying and the camps get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger

02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:40.520
and the people get smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller. But then you realize

02:57:41.560 --> 02:57:47.560
that it might be that that small section that I touched is going to be the change that affects

02:57:47.560 --> 02:57:56.440
all of them. What's going to happen to that 12-year-old boy that has seen the horrors of

02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:04.280
this world and that is absolutely committed to uplifting his people and bringing about a change,

02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:11.000
being responsible for the plight of his people? When I look at any section of devastation in the

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:15.160
world, you never know which part of it that you're going to touch that's going to change

02:58:15.160 --> 02:58:20.200
everything by the grace of God, by the help of God. So you keep trying to do your part.

02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:24.120
The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said that the most beloved of deeds to God

02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:29.400
are the consistent ones even if they're small. That small act of charity, that small smile,

02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:36.200
that small act of kindness, that small prayer might go a long way if he blesses it.

02:58:36.200 --> 02:58:39.160
So keep chipping away, chipping away, chipping away.

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:45.960
So do not be paralyzed by the scale of the division. Just chip away at it.

02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:46.920
Chip away at it.

02:58:46.920 --> 02:58:52.200
Small step at a time. I suppose all of us can do that. Young people can do that.

02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:53.960
Just one person at a time, try to help.

02:58:53.960 --> 02:58:56.120
Yes, absolutely, absolutely.

02:58:56.760 --> 02:59:01.640
Omar, you're an incredible person. You're an inspiration. I think you mentioned

02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:05.640
you came to Dallas for a podcast and instead you got a friend.

02:59:06.120 --> 02:59:06.760
There you go.

02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:13.400
So it's an honor to be your new friend and I think it's time to go pray.

02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:14.360
Absolutely.

02:59:14.360 --> 02:59:19.240
I hope it's okay that I join you at least in movement in prayer.

02:59:19.240 --> 02:59:22.280
Thank you so much. I appreciate you coming down. It's been an absolute pleasure.

03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:08.280
Allah is the greatest.

03:00:11.480 --> 03:00:13.480
Allah is the greatest.

03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:20.920
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah

03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:37.640
wa rahmatullah

03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:07.640
wa rahmatullah

03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:37.640
Yeah.

03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:57.640
All right, thanks so much.

03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:04.280
You sure you don't want to come back? Do a round two?

03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:07.800
Yeah. Thank you, man. Great talking to you, man.

03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:14.440
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Omar Suleiman. To support this podcast,

03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:20.040
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:27.800
Muhammad Ali. Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:33.640
in a world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not

03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:41.480
a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Thank you for listening

03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:43.480
and hope to see you next time.
