00:00.000 --> 00:03.260
The following is a conversation with Richard Wrangham,

00:03.260 --> 00:05.720
a biological anthropologist at Harvard,

00:05.720 --> 00:08.260
specializing in the study of primates

00:08.260 --> 00:12.180
and the evolution of violence, sex, cooking, culture,

00:12.180 --> 00:15.180
and other aspects of ape and human behavior

00:15.180 --> 00:18.340
at the individual and societal level.

00:18.340 --> 00:20.960
He began his career over four decades ago

00:20.960 --> 00:22.340
working with Jane Goodall

00:22.340 --> 00:24.540
and studying the behavior of chimps,

00:24.540 --> 00:27.340
and since then has done a lot of seminal work

00:27.340 --> 00:28.700
on human evolution

00:28.700 --> 00:30.760
and has proposed several theories

00:30.760 --> 00:33.400
for the roles of fire and violence

00:33.400 --> 00:36.600
in the evolution of us, hairless apes,

00:36.600 --> 00:39.480
otherwise known as homo sapiens.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.700
This is the Lux Freedman podcast.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.540
To support it,

00:42.540 --> 00:44.880

00:44.880 --> 00:48.960
And now here's my conversation with Richard Wrangham.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.080
You've said that we're much less violent

00:53.080 --> 00:57.000
than our close living relatives, the chimps.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.980
Can you elaborate on this point of how violent we are

01:00.980 --> 01:04.500
and how violent our evolutionary relatives are?

01:04.500 --> 01:05.980
Well, I haven't said exactly

01:05.980 --> 01:07.940
that we're less violent than chimps.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.260
What I've said is that there are two kinds of violence.

01:11.260 --> 01:13.260
One stems from proactive aggression

01:13.260 --> 01:15.620
and the other stems from reactive aggression.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.840
Proactive aggression is planned aggression.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.780
Reactive aggression is impulsive, defensive.

01:20.780 --> 01:24.560
It's reactive because it takes place

01:24.560 --> 01:26.860
in seconds after the threat.

01:27.980 --> 01:30.860
And the thing that is really striking about humans

01:30.860 --> 01:33.820
compared to our close relatives

01:33.820 --> 01:38.820
is the great reduction in the degree of reactive aggression.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.180
So we are far less violent than chimps

01:43.180 --> 01:46.740
when prompted by some relatively minor threat

01:46.740 --> 01:48.660
within our own society.

01:48.660 --> 01:51.100
And the way I judge that is

01:52.040 --> 01:54.540
with not super satisfactory data,

01:55.520 --> 01:59.440
but the study which is particularly striking

01:59.440 --> 02:04.440
is one of people living as hunter-gatherers

02:05.200 --> 02:09.720
in a really upsetting kind of environment,

02:09.720 --> 02:14.720
namely people in Australia living in a place

02:15.320 --> 02:19.200
where they got a lot of alcohol abuse.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.680
There's a lot of domestic violence.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.680
It's all a sort of a society that is as bad

02:29.220 --> 02:30.540
from the point of view of violence

02:30.540 --> 02:33.160
as an ordinary society can get.

02:34.180 --> 02:36.900
There's excellent data on the frequency

02:36.900 --> 02:39.220
with which people actually have physical violence

02:39.220 --> 02:40.460
and hit each other.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.660
And we can compare that to data

02:42.660 --> 02:46.180
from several different sites comparing,

02:46.180 --> 02:50.100
we're looking at chimpanzee and bonobo violence.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.000
And the difference is between two and three orders

02:54.000 --> 02:56.820
of magnitude, the frequency with which chimps

02:56.820 --> 02:58.860
and bonobos hit each other, chase each other,

02:58.860 --> 03:02.180
charge each other, physically engage

03:02.180 --> 03:06.820
is something between 500 and 1,000 times higher

03:06.820 --> 03:08.420
than in humans.

03:08.420 --> 03:09.940
So there's something just amazing about us.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.640
And this has been recognized for centuries.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.020
Aristotle drew attention to the fact

03:16.020 --> 03:19.040
that we behave in many ways like domesticated animals

03:19.060 --> 03:21.360
because we're so unviolent.

03:21.360 --> 03:26.360
But people say, well, what about the hideous engagements

03:26.840 --> 03:31.020
of this 20th century, the first and second world war

03:31.020 --> 03:33.700
and much else besides?

03:33.700 --> 03:37.140
And that is all proactive violence.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.900
All of that is gangs of people

03:42.320 --> 03:45.180
making deliberate decisions to go off and attack

03:45.180 --> 03:48.900
in circumstances which ideally the attackers

03:49.720 --> 03:51.400
are going to be able to make their kills

03:51.400 --> 03:53.360
and then get out of there.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
In other words, not face confrontation.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.800
That's the ordinary way that arm is trying to work.

03:58.800 --> 04:03.800
And there, it turns out that humans and chimpanzees

04:04.920 --> 04:07.140
are in a very similar kind of state.

04:07.140 --> 04:11.000
That is to say, if you look at the rate of death

04:11.000 --> 04:13.800
from chimpanzees conducting proactive

04:13.800 --> 04:17.920
coalition violence, it's very similar in many ways

04:17.920 --> 04:20.280
to what you see in humans.

04:20.280 --> 04:23.580
So we're not downregulated with proactive violence.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.740
It's just this reactive violence

04:25.740 --> 04:29.140
that is strikingly reduced in humans.

04:29.140 --> 04:33.220
So chimpanzees also practiced kind of tribal warfare.

04:34.060 --> 04:36.060
Indeed they do, yeah.

04:36.060 --> 04:38.980
So this was discovered first in 1974.

04:38.980 --> 04:40.960
It was observed first in 1974,

04:41.940 --> 04:46.940
which was about the time that the first major study

04:48.060 --> 04:51.160
of chimpanzees in the wild by Jane Goodall

04:51.160 --> 04:55.480
had been going for something like five years

04:55.480 --> 05:00.240
during of the chimpanzees being observed

05:00.240 --> 05:01.260
wherever they went.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.980
Until then, they'd been observed at a feeding station

05:06.980 --> 05:11.040
where Jane was luring them in to be observed

05:11.040 --> 05:12.920
by seeing bananas, which is great.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.320
She learned a lot, but she didn't learn

05:15.320 --> 05:17.880
what was happening at the edges of their ranges.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.480
So five years later, it became very obvious

05:22.480 --> 05:25.640
that there was hostile relationships between groups.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.540
And those hostile relationships sometimes take the form

05:30.540 --> 05:32.600
of the kind of hostile relationships

05:32.600 --> 05:37.240
that you see in many animals, which is a bunch of chimps

05:37.240 --> 05:42.240
in this case, shouting at a bunch of other chimps

05:42.360 --> 05:43.900
on their borders.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.520
But dramatically, in addition to that,

05:47.560 --> 05:49.320
there is a second kind of interaction.

05:49.320 --> 05:54.320
And that is when a party of chimpanzees

05:55.960 --> 06:00.960
makes a deliberate venture to the edge of their territory,

06:02.240 --> 06:07.240
silently, and then search for members of neighboring groups.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.760
And what they're searching for is a lone individual.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.240
So I've been with chimps when they've heard

06:15.280 --> 06:17.960
a lone individual under these circumstances

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
or what they think is a lone one.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.040
And they touch each other and look at each other

06:23.040 --> 06:26.120
and then charge forward, very excited.

06:27.520 --> 06:31.800
And then while they're charging, all of a sudden,

06:32.800 --> 06:35.520
the place where they heard a lone call

06:35.520 --> 06:37.520
erupts with a volley of calls.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.840
It was just one calling out of a larger party.

06:40.840 --> 06:44.560
And our chimps put on the brakes and scoot back

06:44.560 --> 06:46.640
for safety into their own territory.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.640
But if in fact they do find a lone individual

06:49.640 --> 06:52.440
and they can sneak up to them,

06:52.440 --> 06:54.960
then they make a deliberate attack.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.520
They're hunting, they're stalking and hunting,

06:57.520 --> 07:00.620
and then they impose terrible damage,

07:00.620 --> 07:03.000
which typically ends in a kill straight away,

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
but it might end up with the victim so damaged

07:08.280 --> 07:13.280
that they'll crawl away and die a few days or hours later.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.320
So that was a very dramatic discovery

07:15.320 --> 07:20.320
because it really made people realize for the first time

07:20.460 --> 07:24.840
that Conrad Lorenz had been wrong when in the 1960s,

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
in his famous book on aggression,

07:26.840 --> 07:30.760
he said warfare is restricted to humans,

07:30.760 --> 07:33.040
animals do not deliberately kill each other.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.120
Well, now we know that actually there's a bunch of animals

07:35.120 --> 07:36.360
that deliberately kill each other,

07:36.360 --> 07:38.520
and they always do so under essentially

07:38.520 --> 07:40.640
the same circumstances, which is,

07:40.640 --> 07:44.160
when they feel safe doing it.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.860
So humans feel safe doing it when they've got a weapon.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.360
Animals feel safe when they have a coalition,

07:52.360 --> 07:54.800
a coalition that has overwhelming power

07:54.800 --> 07:56.720
compared to the victim.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.400
And so wolves will do that, and lions will do that,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.480
and hyenas will do that, and chimpanzees will do it,

08:02.480 --> 08:04.280
and humans do it too.

08:05.280 --> 08:08.420
Can they pull themselves into something

08:08.420 --> 08:10.520
that looks more like a symmetric war

08:10.520 --> 08:12.600
as opposed to an asymmetric one?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.240
So accidentally engaging on the lone individual

08:15.240 --> 08:17.160
and getting themselves into trouble?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.040
Or are they more aggressive

08:19.040 --> 08:21.320
in avoiding these kinds of battles?

08:21.320 --> 08:24.000
No, they're very, very keen to avoid those kinds of battles,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.600
but occasionally they can make a mistake.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.280
But so far there have been no observations

08:32.280 --> 08:33.800
of anything like a battle

08:33.800 --> 08:37.240
in which both sides maintain themselves.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.240
And I think you can very confidently say

08:40.240 --> 08:43.520
that overwhelmingly what happens is that if they discover

08:43.520 --> 08:46.260
that there's several individuals on the other side,

08:46.260 --> 08:48.240
then both sides retreat.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.280
Nobody wants to get hurt.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.000
What they want to do is to hurt others.

08:52.000 --> 08:52.840
Yes.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.460
So you mentioned Jane Goodall.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.640
You've worked with her.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.120
What was it like working with her?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.720
What have you learned from her?

09:00.720 --> 09:05.000
Well, she's a wonderfully independent, courageous person,

09:05.000 --> 09:09.680
who she famously began her studies

09:09.680 --> 09:14.680
not as a qualified person in terms of education,

09:16.280 --> 09:19.600
but qualified only by enthusiasm

09:19.600 --> 09:24.260
and considerable experience even in her early 20s with nature.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.040
So she's courageous in the sense

09:28.040 --> 09:32.080
of being able to take on challenges.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.360
The thing that is very impressive about her

09:34.360 --> 09:39.360
is her total fidelity to the observations,

09:40.880 --> 09:45.880
very unwilling to extend beyond the observations,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.480
waiting until they mount up

09:48.480 --> 09:50.480
and you've really got a confident picture

09:52.120 --> 09:56.860
and tremendous attention to individuals.

09:56.860 --> 10:00.420
So that was an interesting problem from her point of view

10:00.420 --> 10:05.420
because when she got to know the chimpanzees of Gombe,

10:05.620 --> 10:08.100
this particular community of Cazacayla,

10:08.100 --> 10:09.420
about 60 individuals,

10:10.900 --> 10:14.700
so Gombe was in Tanzania on Lake Tanganyika.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.500
She was there initially with her mother

10:16.500 --> 10:20.420
and then alone for two or three years

10:20.420 --> 10:22.660
of really intense observation

10:22.660 --> 10:24.820
and then slowly joined by other people.

10:25.820 --> 10:30.820
What she discovered was that there were obvious differences

10:31.620 --> 10:34.540
in individual personality.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.460
And the difficulty about that was that

10:37.340 --> 10:42.340
when she reported this to the larger scientific world,

10:43.020 --> 10:45.940
initially her advisors at Cambridge,

10:47.460 --> 10:49.900
they said, well, we don't know how to handle that

10:49.900 --> 10:52.820
because you've got to treat all these animals

10:52.820 --> 10:54.380
as the same basically

10:54.420 --> 10:59.420
because there is no research tradition

11:00.500 --> 11:03.260
of thinking about personalities.

11:03.260 --> 11:06.780
Well, now, whatever it is, 60 years later,

11:07.860 --> 11:11.580
the study of personalities is a very rich part

11:11.580 --> 11:13.300
of the study of animal behavior.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.020
At any rate, the important point in terms of what was she like

11:18.020 --> 11:19.260
is that she stuck to her guns

11:19.260 --> 11:23.340
and she absolutely insisted that we have to show,

11:23.500 --> 11:25.260
describe in great detail,

11:25.260 --> 11:28.380
the differences in personality among these individuals

11:28.380 --> 11:30.420
and then you can leave it to the evolutionary biologists

11:30.420 --> 11:32.660
to think about what it means.

11:32.660 --> 11:35.980
So what is the process of observation like this

11:37.060 --> 11:39.220
like observing the personality

11:39.220 --> 11:41.540
but also observing in a way

11:41.540 --> 11:45.540
that's not projecting your beliefs about human nature

11:45.540 --> 11:48.820
or animal nature onto chimps,

11:48.820 --> 11:52.540
which is probably really tempting to project.

11:52.540 --> 11:55.940
So your understanding of the way the human world works,

11:55.940 --> 11:59.420
projecting that onto the chimp world.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.580
Yes, I mean, it's particularly difficult with chimps

12:01.580 --> 12:05.220
because chimps are so similar to humans in their behavior

12:05.220 --> 12:09.740
that it's very easy to make those projections, as you say.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.860
The process involves making very clear definitions

12:14.860 --> 12:16.940
of what a behavior is.

12:17.500 --> 12:22.500
Aggression can be defined in terms of a forceful hit,

12:24.300 --> 12:25.620
a bite and so on.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.340
And writing down every time these things happen

12:30.340 --> 12:32.700
and then slowly totting up the numbers of times

12:32.700 --> 12:35.780
that they happen from individual A

12:35.780 --> 12:37.780
towards individuals B, C, D and E

12:39.140 --> 12:41.660
so that you build up a very concrete picture

12:41.660 --> 12:43.820
rather than interpreting at any point

12:43.820 --> 12:44.980
and stopping and saying,

12:44.980 --> 12:47.380
well, they seem to be rather aggressive.

12:48.420 --> 12:53.340
So the formal system is that you build up a pattern

12:53.340 --> 12:57.380
of the relationships based on a description

12:57.380 --> 12:59.500
of the different types of interactions,

12:59.500 --> 13:02.020
the aggressive and the friendly interactions.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.060
And all of these are defined in concrete.

13:07.660 --> 13:12.300
And so from that you extract a pattern of relationships

13:12.340 --> 13:17.340
and the relationships can be defined as relatively friendly,

13:19.740 --> 13:24.740
relatively aggressive, competitive based on the frequency

13:25.140 --> 13:27.500
of these types of interactions.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.060
And so one can talk in terms of individuals

13:31.060 --> 13:35.060
having a relationship which on the scores of friendliness

13:35.060 --> 13:38.220
is two standard deviations outside the mean.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.060
I mean, you know, it's-

13:41.140 --> 13:44.660
In which direction, sorry, both directions?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.940
Well, I mean, there will be obviously the friendly ones

13:48.940 --> 13:52.060
would be the ones who have exceptionally high rates

13:52.060 --> 13:54.460
of spending time close to each other,

13:54.460 --> 13:56.580
of touching each other in a gentle way,

13:56.580 --> 14:00.060
of grooming each other and by the way,

14:00.060 --> 14:03.420
finding that those things are correlated with each other.

14:03.420 --> 14:08.340
So it's possible to define a friendship with a capital F

14:08.340 --> 14:10.140
in a very systematic way.

14:10.540 --> 14:14.780
And to compare that between individuals,

14:14.780 --> 14:18.780
but also between communities of chimpanzees

14:18.780 --> 14:21.060
and between different species.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.420
So that, you know, we can say that in some species,

14:23.420 --> 14:26.860
individuals have friends and others they don't at all.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.700
What about just because there's different personalities

14:29.700 --> 14:31.900
and because they're so fascinating,

14:31.900 --> 14:33.620
what about sort of falling in love

14:33.620 --> 14:37.220
or forming friendships with chimps, you know?

14:37.220 --> 14:40.260
Like really, you know,

14:40.260 --> 14:43.900
connecting with them as an observer.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.300
What role does that play?

14:46.300 --> 14:47.980
Because you're tracking these individuals

14:47.980 --> 14:50.780
that are full of life and intelligence

14:50.780 --> 14:53.540
for long periods of time.

14:53.540 --> 14:58.140
Plus as a human, especially in those days for Jane,

14:58.140 --> 15:00.260
she's alone observing it.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.060
It gets lonely as a human.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.420
I mean, probably deeply lonely as a human being observed

15:05.420 --> 15:07.740
by these other intelligent species.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.940
It's a very reasonable question.

15:08.940 --> 15:11.620
And of course, Jane in those early years,

15:11.620 --> 15:15.300
I think she's willing now to talk about the fact

15:15.300 --> 15:19.860
that she regrets to some extent how close she became.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.660
And the problem is not just from the humans,

15:23.660 --> 15:25.500
the problem is from the chimpanzees as well,

15:25.500 --> 15:30.500
because they do things that are extremely affectionate

15:31.660 --> 15:33.900
if you like, you know?

15:33.900 --> 15:38.420
At one point, Jane offered a ripe fruit

15:39.700 --> 15:42.300
to a chimpanzee called David Greybeard.

15:42.300 --> 15:46.380
David Greybeard took it and squeezed her hand

15:47.700 --> 15:48.540
as if to say thank you.

15:48.540 --> 15:51.220
And then I think he gave it back, if I remember rightly.

15:51.220 --> 15:52.060
Yeah.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.060
No thank you.

15:55.060 --> 15:55.900
Right.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.420
Oh, it's almost like thank you

15:59.420 --> 16:02.580
and returning the affection by giving the fruit.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.420
Yeah, exactly.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.980
Yeah, no, it was a gentle squeeze.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.140
I mean, chimpanzees could squeeze you very hard

16:08.140 --> 16:10.220
as occasionally has happened.

16:11.340 --> 16:13.460
Some chimps are aggressive to people

16:14.660 --> 16:16.700
and others are friendly.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.940
And the ones that are friendly

16:17.940 --> 16:20.260
tend to be rather sympathetic characters

16:20.260 --> 16:24.180
because they might be ones who are having problems

16:24.180 --> 16:26.340
in their own society.

16:26.340 --> 16:29.420
So Joe Mio in Gombe used to come

16:29.420 --> 16:31.700
and sit next to me quite often.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.340
And he was having a hard time making it in that society,

16:35.340 --> 16:36.820
you know, which I can describe to you

16:36.820 --> 16:39.020
in terms of the number of aggressive interactions

16:39.020 --> 16:43.260
if you want, you know, but just to be informed about it.

16:43.260 --> 16:48.260
So all of this is a temptation to be very firmly resisted.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.660
And in the community that I've been working with

16:51.660 --> 16:53.300
in Uganda for the last 30 years,

16:53.300 --> 16:56.060
we try extremely hard to impress

16:56.060 --> 16:58.380
on all of the research students who come with us

16:58.380 --> 17:00.100
that it is absolutely vital

17:00.100 --> 17:02.740
that you do not fall into that temptation.

17:02.740 --> 17:05.820
Now, you know, we heard a story of one person

17:05.820 --> 17:09.100
who did reach out and touch one of our chimps.

17:09.100 --> 17:12.180
It's a very, very bad idea.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.060
Not because the chimp is going to

17:15.380 --> 17:17.100
do anything violent at the time,

17:18.540 --> 17:23.540
but because if they learn that humans are as weak

17:23.860 --> 17:26.020
physically as we are compared to them,

17:26.020 --> 17:27.940
then they can take advantage of it.

17:28.740 --> 17:30.740
And that's what happened in Gombe.

17:30.740 --> 17:35.300
So after Jane had done the very obvious thing

17:35.300 --> 17:38.780
when you're first engaged in this game

17:38.780 --> 17:41.540
of allowing the infants to approach her

17:41.540 --> 17:43.780
and then tickling them and playing with them,

17:45.500 --> 17:49.140
some of those infants had the personality

17:49.140 --> 17:53.300
of wanting to take advantage of that knowledge later.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.060
And so, you know, you had an individual, Frodo,

17:56.060 --> 17:59.940
who was violent on a regular basis towards humans

17:59.940 --> 18:01.660
when he was an adult, and he was quite dangerous.

18:01.660 --> 18:02.940
I mean, he could easily have killed someone.

18:02.940 --> 18:06.660
In fact, he did kill one person, he killed a baby

18:06.660 --> 18:11.060
that he took from a mother, a human baby,

18:11.060 --> 18:13.860
that he took off her hip when he met her on the path.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.820
So, you know, it's a reminder that we're dealing

18:17.820 --> 18:22.540
with a species that are rather human-like

18:22.540 --> 18:24.500
in the range of emotions they have,

18:24.500 --> 18:26.380
in the capacities they have,

18:26.380 --> 18:28.940
and even in the strength they have,

18:28.940 --> 18:33.100
they are in many ways stronger than humans.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.140
So you've got to be careful.

18:37.140 --> 18:39.980
So in the full range of friendliness and violence,

18:39.980 --> 18:43.220
the capacity for these very human things.

18:44.060 --> 18:47.340
Yes, I mean, it's very obvious with violence,

18:47.340 --> 18:50.220
as we talked about, that they will kill,

18:50.220 --> 18:52.060
they will kill not just strangers.

18:53.060 --> 18:57.420
They can kill other adults within their own group.

18:57.420 --> 18:59.460
They can kill babies that are strangers.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.020
They can kill babies in their own group.

19:01.020 --> 19:04.220
So, you know, this is a long-lived individual.

19:04.220 --> 19:06.500
Obviously, these killings can't have very often,

19:06.500 --> 19:08.300
because otherwise they'd all be dead.

19:09.180 --> 19:11.860
And we're now finding that they can live

19:11.860 --> 19:14.020
to 50 or 60 years in the wild

19:14.020 --> 19:16.020
at relatively low population density,

19:16.020 --> 19:17.140
because they're big animals,

19:17.140 --> 19:20.300
eating a rather specialized kind of food, the ripe fruits.

19:22.420 --> 19:23.940
So it doesn't happen all the time.

19:23.940 --> 19:27.820
With friendliness, they are very strong

19:27.820 --> 19:28.820
to support each other.

19:28.820 --> 19:33.820
They very much depend on their close friendships,

19:34.660 --> 19:38.940
which they express through physical contact,

19:38.940 --> 19:41.620
and particularly through grooming.

19:41.620 --> 19:46.140
So grooming occurs when one individual approaches another.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.260
I might present for grooming,

19:48.260 --> 19:50.820
a very common way of starting,

19:50.820 --> 19:53.180
turning their back or presenting an arm

19:53.180 --> 19:54.020
or something like that,

19:54.020 --> 19:57.820
and the other just riffles their fingers through the hair.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.500
And that's partly just soothing,

20:00.500 --> 20:04.380
and it's partly looking for parasites,

20:04.380 --> 20:06.420
but mostly it's just soothing.

20:06.420 --> 20:11.420
And the point about this is it can go on for half an hour,

20:12.060 --> 20:14.620
it can go on for sometimes even an hour.

20:15.460 --> 20:20.060
So this is a major expression of interest in somebody else.

20:21.300 --> 20:25.700
When did your interest in this one particular aspects

20:25.700 --> 20:28.940
of chimp come to be, which is violence?

20:28.940 --> 20:32.260
When did the study of violence in chimps

20:32.260 --> 20:34.500
become something you're deeply interested in?

20:35.780 --> 20:40.780
Well, for my PhD in the early 1970s,

20:41.500 --> 20:43.020
I was in Gombe with Jane Goodall

20:43.020 --> 20:46.180
and was studying feeding behavior.

20:46.180 --> 20:49.060
But during that time, we were seeing,

20:49.060 --> 20:52.820
and I say we because there were half a dozen research

20:52.820 --> 20:55.860
students all in her camp.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.220
We were discovering that chimps

21:01.220 --> 21:05.060
had this capacity for violence.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.500
The first kill happened during that time,

21:07.500 --> 21:09.980
which was of an infant in a neighboring group.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.220
And we were starting to see these hunting expeditions.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.860
And this was the start of my interest

21:19.660 --> 21:21.780
because it was such chilling evidence

21:21.780 --> 21:26.780
of an extraordinary similarity between chimps and humans.

21:28.380 --> 21:32.340
Now, at that time, we didn't know very much

21:32.340 --> 21:36.140
about how chimpanzees and humans were related.

21:36.140 --> 21:41.140
Chimps, gorillas, bonobos are all three big black hairy things

21:41.460 --> 21:45.460
that live in the African forests and eat fruits

21:45.500 --> 21:48.980
and leaves when they can't find fruits

21:48.980 --> 21:50.260
and walk on their knuckles.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.820
And they all look rather similar to each other.

21:51.820 --> 21:54.860
So they seem as though those three species,

21:54.860 --> 21:56.740
chimps and gorillas and bonobos,

21:56.740 --> 21:59.420
should all be each other's closest relatives

21:59.420 --> 22:01.540
and humans are something rather separate.

22:01.540 --> 22:04.700
And so any of them would be of interest to us.

22:04.700 --> 22:08.580
Subsequently, we learn that actually that's not true

22:08.580 --> 22:10.460
and that there's a special relationship

22:10.460 --> 22:13.420
between humans and chimpanzees.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.940
But at the time, even without knowing that,

22:15.940 --> 22:18.460
it was obvious that there was something very odd

22:18.460 --> 22:22.780
about chimpanzees because Jane had discovered

22:22.780 --> 22:25.380
they were making tools.

22:25.380 --> 22:29.060
She had seen that they were hunting meat.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.740
She had seen that they were sharing the meat

22:31.740 --> 22:33.180
among each other.

22:33.180 --> 22:36.500
She had seen that the societies were dominated politically

22:36.500 --> 22:38.620
by males, coalitions of males.

22:38.620 --> 22:39.780
All of these things, of course,

22:39.780 --> 22:42.220
resonate so closely with humans.

22:43.100 --> 22:47.380
And then it turns out that in contrast

22:47.380 --> 22:50.020
to conventional wisdom at the time,

22:50.020 --> 22:53.140
the chimpanzees were capable of hunting

22:53.140 --> 22:55.220
and killing members of neighboring groups.

22:56.580 --> 23:00.340
Well, at that point, the similarities

23:00.340 --> 23:04.540
between chimps and humans become less a matter

23:04.540 --> 23:09.100
of sort of sheer intellectual fascination

23:09.100 --> 23:11.460
than something that has a really deep meaning

23:11.540 --> 23:14.580
about our understanding of ourselves.

23:15.620 --> 23:19.740
I mean, until then, you can cheerfully think of humans

23:19.740 --> 23:22.900
as a species apart from the rest of nature

23:22.900 --> 23:24.780
because we are so peculiar.

23:24.780 --> 23:28.500
But when it turns out that, as it turns out,

23:28.500 --> 23:33.500
one of our two closest relatives has got these features

23:33.500 --> 23:36.620
that we share and that one of the features

23:36.620 --> 23:40.060
is something that is the most horrendous

23:40.980 --> 23:44.620
as well as fascinating aspect of human behavior,

23:44.620 --> 23:48.540
then how can you resist just trying to find out

23:48.540 --> 23:49.980
what's going on?

23:49.980 --> 23:51.660
So I have to say this.

23:51.660 --> 23:54.500
I'm not sure if you're familiar with a man,

23:54.500 --> 23:56.340
but fans of this podcast are.

23:56.340 --> 23:58.500
So we're talking about chimps,

23:58.500 --> 23:59.980
we're talking about violence.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.900
My now friend, Mr. Joe Rogan,

24:02.900 --> 24:04.340
is a big fan of those things.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.180
I'm a big fan of these topics.

24:06.180 --> 24:10.180
I think a lot of people are fascinated by these topics.

24:10.180 --> 24:15.180
So as you're saying, why do we find the exploration

24:16.660 --> 24:20.940
of violence and the relations between chimps so interesting?

24:20.940 --> 24:23.980
What can they teach us about ourselves?

24:26.220 --> 24:29.820
Until we had this information about chimpanzees,

24:29.820 --> 24:32.820
it was possible to believe

24:32.820 --> 24:37.820
that the psychology behind warfare

24:40.820 --> 24:45.820
was totally the result of some kind of recent

24:47.420 --> 24:51.340
cultural innovation that had nothing to do with our biology.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.300
Or if you like, that it's got something to do

24:54.300 --> 24:59.300
with sin and God and the devil and that sort of thing.

25:00.300 --> 25:05.300
But what the chimps tell us after we think carefully

25:07.100 --> 25:11.700
about it is that it seems undoubtedly the case

25:11.700 --> 25:16.700
that our evolutionary psychology has given us

25:18.460 --> 25:22.660
the same kind of attitude towards violence

25:22.660 --> 25:27.660
as occurred in chimpanzees and in both species.

25:28.300 --> 25:32.060
It has evolved because of its evolutionary significance.

25:32.060 --> 25:34.620
In other words, because it's been helpful

25:34.620 --> 25:37.900
to the individuals who have practiced it.

25:37.900 --> 25:41.900
And now we know that, as I mentioned,

25:41.900 --> 25:44.140
other species do this as well.

25:44.140 --> 25:49.140
In fact, wolves, which this is a really kind

25:49.420 --> 25:53.180
of ironical observation.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.860
Conrad Lorentz, who I mentioned, had been the person

25:55.860 --> 26:00.220
who thought that human aggression in the form

26:00.220 --> 26:02.020
of killing members of your own species

26:02.020 --> 26:04.100
was unique to our species.

26:04.100 --> 26:05.620
He was a great fan of wolves.

26:05.620 --> 26:07.020
He studied wolves.

26:07.020 --> 26:11.020
And in captivity, he noted that wolves are very unlikely

26:11.020 --> 26:16.020
to harm each other in spats among members of the same group.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.140
What happens is that one of them will roll over

26:19.140 --> 26:20.100
and present their neck,

26:20.100 --> 26:22.420
much as you see in a dog park nowadays.

26:22.420 --> 26:25.700
And the other might put their jaws on the neck.

26:26.580 --> 26:27.420
But will not bite.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.300
Okay, so now it turns out that if you study wolves

26:30.300 --> 26:35.220
in the wild, then neighboring packs often go hunting

26:35.220 --> 26:36.740
for each other.

26:36.740 --> 26:39.300
They are in fierce competition.

26:39.300 --> 26:43.660
And as much as 50% of the mortality of wolves

26:43.660 --> 26:48.300
is due to being killed by other wolves, adult mortality.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.180
So it's a really serious business.

26:51.300 --> 26:55.460
The chimpanzees and humans fit into a larger pattern

26:56.220 --> 26:57.860
of understanding animals in which

26:59.740 --> 27:02.020
you don't have an instinct for violence.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.100
What you have is an instinct, if you like,

27:05.100 --> 27:07.780
to use violence adaptively.

27:07.780 --> 27:11.700
And if the right circumstances come up, it'll be adaptive.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.740
If the right circumstances don't come up, it won't be.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.220
So some chimpanzee communities

27:17.220 --> 27:19.060
are much more violent than others

27:19.060 --> 27:23.260
because of things like the frequency with which

27:23.300 --> 27:28.060
a large party of males is likely to meet a lone victim.

27:28.060 --> 27:30.500
And that's gonna depend on the local ecology.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.700
But, you know, so the overall answer to the question

27:35.700 --> 27:39.300
of what do chimps teach us is that we have to take

27:39.300 --> 27:43.300
very seriously the notion that in humans,

27:44.220 --> 27:48.980
the tendency to make war is a consequence

27:48.980 --> 27:52.380
of a long-term evolutionary adaptation

27:52.420 --> 27:55.060
and not just a military ideology

27:55.060 --> 27:59.300
or some sort of local patriarchal phenomenon.

28:00.420 --> 28:03.060
And of course, you know, a reading of history,

28:03.060 --> 28:07.140
a judicious reading of history, fits that very easily

28:07.140 --> 28:09.860
because war is so commonplace.

28:10.820 --> 28:11.740
It's not an accident.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.540
So it's not a construction of human civilization.

28:14.540 --> 28:17.540
It's deeply within us, violence.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.420
So what's the difference between violence

28:20.420 --> 28:24.660
on the individual level versus group is,

28:24.660 --> 28:26.860
it seems like with chimps and with wolves,

28:26.860 --> 28:29.260
there's something about the dynamic

28:29.260 --> 28:33.940
of multiple chimps together

28:33.940 --> 28:36.300
that increase the chance of violence.

28:36.300 --> 28:40.980
Or is violence still fundamentally part of the individual?

28:40.980 --> 28:44.980
Like would an individual be as violent

28:44.980 --> 28:47.980
as they might be as part of a group?

28:47.980 --> 28:51.220
If we're talking about killing,

28:51.220 --> 28:54.180
then violence in the sense of killing

28:54.180 --> 28:58.980
is very much associated with a group.

28:58.980 --> 29:03.940
And the reason is that individuals don't benefit

29:03.940 --> 29:05.540
by getting into a fight

29:05.540 --> 29:08.660
in which they risk being hurt themselves.

29:08.660 --> 29:12.620
So it's only when you have overwhelming power

29:12.620 --> 29:16.740
that the temptation to try and kill another victim

29:16.780 --> 29:20.660
rises sufficiently for them to be motivated to do it.

29:23.380 --> 29:27.860
The average number of chimpanzee males

29:27.860 --> 29:30.500
that attack a single male

29:30.500 --> 29:33.180
in something like 50 observations

29:33.180 --> 29:36.020
that have accumulated in the last 50 years

29:36.020 --> 29:41.020
from various different study sites is eight, eight to one.

29:41.900 --> 29:46.780
Now, sometimes it can go as low as three to one,

29:46.780 --> 29:49.420
but that's getting risky.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.620
But if you have eight, you can see what can happen.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.860
I mean, basically you have one male on one foot,

29:55.860 --> 29:58.060
another male on another foot, another male on an arm,

29:58.060 --> 29:59.620
another male on another arm.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.460
Now you have an immobilized victim

30:02.460 --> 30:06.300
with four individuals capable of just doing the damage.

30:06.300 --> 30:08.660
And so they can then move in and tear out his thorax

30:08.660 --> 30:10.180
and tear off his testicles

30:10.180 --> 30:12.540
and twist an arm until it breaks

30:12.540 --> 30:16.700
and do this appalling damage with no weapons.

30:18.460 --> 30:23.460
What is the way in which they prefer to commit to violence?

30:23.660 --> 30:24.860
Is there something to be said

30:24.860 --> 30:27.820
about like the actual process of it?

30:27.820 --> 30:29.380
Is there an artistry to it?

30:29.380 --> 30:32.380
So if you look at human warfare,

30:32.380 --> 30:34.180
there's different parts in history

30:34.180 --> 30:37.820
prefer different kind of approaches to violence.

30:37.900 --> 30:41.220
It had more to do with tools, I think, on the human side,

30:41.220 --> 30:44.740
but just the nature of violence itself,

30:44.740 --> 30:47.540
sorry, the practice, the strategy of violence,

30:47.540 --> 30:49.100
is it basically the same?

30:49.100 --> 30:53.420
You improvise, you immobilize the victim

30:53.420 --> 30:54.940
and they just rip off different parts

30:54.940 --> 30:56.740
of their body kind of thing?

30:56.740 --> 30:59.860
Yeah, you have to understand that these things

30:59.860 --> 31:04.860
are happening at high speed in thick vegetation, mostly.

31:05.860 --> 31:09.860
So they have not been filmed carefully.

31:09.860 --> 31:13.420
We have a few little glimpses of them

31:13.420 --> 31:16.540
from one or two people like David Watts,

31:16.540 --> 31:17.660
who's got some great video,

31:17.660 --> 31:21.100
but we don't know enough to be able to say that.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.660
It's hard for me to imagine that there are styles

31:23.660 --> 31:28.220
that vary between communities, cultural styles,

31:28.220 --> 31:29.980
but it is possible.

31:29.980 --> 31:33.700
And one thing that is striking is that

31:33.900 --> 31:37.100
the number of times that an individual victim

31:37.100 --> 31:39.220
has been killed immediately

31:40.180 --> 31:45.180
has been higher in Kibale Forest in Uganda

31:45.180 --> 31:48.580
than in Gombe National Park in Tanzania.

31:48.580 --> 31:50.140
It's conceivable that's just chance.

31:50.140 --> 31:54.300
We don't have real numbers now, but what is this?

31:54.300 --> 31:55.380
I can't remember the exact numbers,

31:55.380 --> 31:58.180
but 10 versus 15 or something.

31:58.180 --> 32:03.180
So maybe they damaged to the point of expecting a death

32:06.420 --> 32:09.140
in one place and they just finished it off in the other,

32:09.140 --> 32:12.060
but most likely that sort of difference

32:12.060 --> 32:17.060
will be due to differences in the numbers of attackers.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.860
You know, human beings are able to conceive

32:19.860 --> 32:23.340
of the philosophical notion of death, of mortality.

32:23.340 --> 32:28.140
Is there any of that for chimps?

32:28.540 --> 32:30.460
When they're thinking about violence,

32:30.460 --> 32:33.500
is violence, like what is the nature

32:33.500 --> 32:36.500
of their conception of violence, do you think?

32:36.500 --> 32:38.460
Do they realize they're taking

32:38.460 --> 32:41.580
another conscious being's life?

32:41.580 --> 32:45.940
Or is it some kind of like optimization

32:45.940 --> 32:48.500
over the use of resources or something like that?

32:50.620 --> 32:53.300
I don't think it's, I can't think of any way

32:53.300 --> 32:55.140
to get an answer to the question

32:55.140 --> 32:56.700
of what they know about that.

32:57.660 --> 33:02.660
I think that the way to think about the motivation

33:03.260 --> 33:08.260
is rather like the motivation in sex.

33:09.820 --> 33:14.620
So when males are interested in having sex with a female,

33:14.620 --> 33:17.020
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans,

33:18.860 --> 33:20.260
they don't think about the fact

33:20.260 --> 33:25.260
that what this is going to do is to lead to a baby, mostly.

33:25.260 --> 33:26.100
You're right.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.580
Obviously, what they're thinking about is,

33:27.580 --> 33:28.780
I wanna get my end away.

33:29.900 --> 33:34.460
And I think that it's a similar kind of process

33:34.460 --> 33:35.740
with the chimps.

33:35.740 --> 33:37.660
What they are thinking about is,

33:38.700 --> 33:41.660
I wanna kill this individual.

33:41.660 --> 33:45.580
And it's hard to imagine that taking

33:45.580 --> 33:47.580
the other individual's perspective

33:47.580 --> 33:50.220
and thinking about what it means for them to die

33:50.220 --> 33:51.740
is gonna be an important part of that.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.780
In fact, there's reasons to think

33:53.780 --> 33:55.100
it should not be an important part of it

33:55.100 --> 33:56.100
because it might inhibit them

33:56.100 --> 33:57.940
and they don't wanna be inhibited.

33:57.940 --> 34:01.660
The more efficient they are in doing this, the better.

34:01.660 --> 34:03.460
But I think it's interesting to think about

34:03.460 --> 34:04.700
this whole motivational question

34:04.700 --> 34:09.700
because it does produce the sort of rather haunting thought

34:09.740 --> 34:11.700
that there has been selection

34:11.700 --> 34:15.500
in favor of enthusiasm about killing.

34:16.980 --> 34:21.980
And in our relatively gentle

34:21.980 --> 34:24.740
and deliberately moral society

34:24.740 --> 34:26.540
that we have today,

34:26.540 --> 34:28.980
it's very difficult for us to face the thought

34:28.980 --> 34:32.460
that in all of us,

34:32.460 --> 34:37.220
there might've been a residue,

34:37.220 --> 34:38.740
and more than that,

34:38.740 --> 34:43.580
sort of an active potential for that thought

34:43.580 --> 34:46.540
of really enjoying killing someone else.

34:47.620 --> 34:52.580
But I think one can sustain that thought fairly obviously

34:52.580 --> 34:56.900
by thinking of circumstances in which it would be true

34:57.940 --> 35:02.940
that the ordinary human male would be delighted

35:03.540 --> 35:06.580
to be part of a group that was killing someone.

35:06.580 --> 35:10.380
What you've gotta do is to be in a position

35:10.380 --> 35:12.540
where you're regarding the victim

35:12.540 --> 35:16.380
as dangerous and thoroughly hostile.

35:17.580 --> 35:21.020
But the pure enjoyment of violence,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.700
I don't know if you know this historian, Dan Carlin,

35:24.700 --> 35:25.980
he has a podcast.

35:25.980 --> 35:27.660
He has an episode,

35:28.940 --> 35:32.100
three, four-hour episode

35:32.100 --> 35:33.260
that I recommend to others.

35:33.260 --> 35:34.940
It's quite haunting.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.340
But he takes us through an entire history.

35:38.340 --> 35:40.740
It's called Painful Tainment,

35:40.740 --> 35:45.740
the history of humans enjoying the murder of others

35:47.700 --> 35:48.900
in a large group.

35:48.900 --> 35:53.620
So public executions were a long part of human history.

35:53.620 --> 35:58.260
And there's something that for some reason,

35:58.260 --> 36:03.260
humans seem to have been drawn to just watching others die.

36:03.340 --> 36:06.780
And he ventures to say that that may still be part of us.

36:06.780 --> 36:11.380
For example, he said if it was possible to televise,

36:11.380 --> 36:13.300
to stream online, for example,

36:13.300 --> 36:15.940
the execution and the murder of somebody,

36:15.940 --> 36:18.020
or even the torture of somebody,

36:18.020 --> 36:23.020
that a very large fraction of the population on Earth

36:23.220 --> 36:25.020
would not be able to look away.

36:25.020 --> 36:29.820
They'd be drawn to that somehow as a very dark thought

36:29.820 --> 36:31.700
that we were drawn to that.

36:31.700 --> 36:34.020
So you think that's part of us in there somewhere,

36:34.020 --> 36:39.020
that selection, that we evolved for the enjoyment of killing

36:39.340 --> 36:41.980
and the enjoyment of observing

36:44.300 --> 36:47.460
those in our tribe doing the killing.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.180
Yes.

36:49.180 --> 36:52.740
And that word you produced at the end is critical, I think,

36:52.740 --> 36:57.500
because it would be a little bit weird, I think,

36:57.500 --> 37:00.780
to imagine a lot of enjoyment

37:00.780 --> 37:03.780
about people in your own tribe being killed.

37:03.780 --> 37:04.620
Right.

37:04.620 --> 37:06.620
I don't think we're interested in violence

37:06.620 --> 37:08.460
for violence's sake that much.

37:12.100 --> 37:15.420
It's when you get these social boundaries set up.

37:15.420 --> 37:19.460
And in today's world, happily,

37:20.860 --> 37:24.060
we kind of are already one world.

37:25.700 --> 37:29.220
You have to dehumanize someone to get to the point

37:29.220 --> 37:34.220
where they are really outside our recognition of a tribe

37:34.220 --> 37:37.420
at some level, which is the whole human species.

37:37.420 --> 37:41.180
But in ancient times, that would not have been true

37:41.180 --> 37:42.660
because in ancient times,

37:43.660 --> 37:47.020
there are lots of accounts of hunters and gatherers

37:47.020 --> 37:50.180
in which the appearance of a stranger

37:51.700 --> 37:56.220
would lead to an immediate response of shooting on site

37:57.140 --> 38:00.340
because what was human was the people

38:00.340 --> 38:02.980
that were in your society.

38:02.980 --> 38:05.860
And the other things that actually looked like us

38:05.860 --> 38:09.460
and were human in that sense were not regarded as human.

38:10.460 --> 38:13.380
So there was a kind of automatic dehumanization

38:13.380 --> 38:15.980
of everybody that didn't speak our language

38:15.980 --> 38:20.420
or hadn't already somehow become recognized

38:20.420 --> 38:25.060
as sufficiently like us to escape

38:25.060 --> 38:27.540
the dehumanization content.

38:27.540 --> 38:29.740
And so hopefully the story of human history

38:29.740 --> 38:34.740
is that tribalism fades away,

38:35.060 --> 38:38.900
that our dehumanization, the natural desire to dehumanize,

38:39.140 --> 38:42.300
or a tendency to dehumanize groups

38:42.300 --> 38:45.820
that are not within this tribe decreases over time.

38:45.820 --> 38:49.740
And so then the desire for violence decreases over time.

38:49.740 --> 38:52.540
Yeah, I mean, that's the optimistic perspective.

38:52.540 --> 38:56.220
And the great sort of concern, of course,

38:56.220 --> 39:00.380
is that small conflicts can build up into bigger conflicts

39:00.380 --> 39:03.660
and then dehumanization happens and then violence is released.

39:04.740 --> 39:06.300
As Hannah Arendt says,

39:06.300 --> 39:10.140
there currently is no known alternative to war

39:10.140 --> 39:14.380
as a means of settling really important conflicts.

39:16.540 --> 39:18.780
So if we look at the big picture,

39:18.780 --> 39:21.980
what role has violence or do you think violence

39:21.980 --> 39:25.020
has played in the evolution of Homo sapiens?

39:25.020 --> 39:27.980
So we are quite an intelligent,

39:27.980 --> 39:31.420
quite a beautiful, particular little branch

39:31.420 --> 39:32.940
on the evolutionary tree.

39:33.940 --> 39:38.940
What part of that was played by our tendency to be violent?

39:41.740 --> 39:43.860
Well, I think that violence was responsible

39:43.860 --> 39:46.100
for creating your Homo sapiens.

39:49.220 --> 39:54.220
And that raises the question of what Homo sapiens is.

39:55.180 --> 39:56.020
Yes.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.700
Yeah, exactly.

39:58.780 --> 40:03.780
So, you know, nowadays people begin the sort of concept

40:06.700 --> 40:10.860
of what Homo sapiens is by thinking about features

40:10.860 --> 40:12.420
that are very obviously different

40:12.420 --> 40:14.740
from all of the other species of Homo.

40:15.740 --> 40:20.740
And our large brain, our very rounded cranium,

40:21.220 --> 40:24.340
our relatively small face, these are characteristics

40:24.340 --> 40:27.820
which are developed in a relatively modern way

40:27.820 --> 40:31.220
by about 170,000 years ago.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.060
So, you know, that's one of the earliest skulls in Africa

40:34.060 --> 40:36.660
that really captures that.

40:36.660 --> 40:41.660
But it has been argued that that is an episode

40:44.380 --> 40:49.380
in a process that has been started substantially earlier.

40:50.340 --> 40:52.300
And there's no doubt that that's true.

40:52.300 --> 40:55.180
Homo sapiens is a species that has been changing

40:55.180 --> 41:00.180
pretty continuously throughout the length of time it's there.

41:00.340 --> 41:03.420
And it goes back to 300,000 years ago.

41:03.420 --> 41:08.420
315, naturally, is the time, the best estimate of a date

41:08.620 --> 41:11.980
for a series of bones from Morocco

41:13.180 --> 41:16.940
that have been dated three or four years ago at that time

41:16.940 --> 41:21.460
and have been characterized as earliest Homo sapiens.

41:21.460 --> 41:25.660
Now, at that point, they are only beginning

41:25.660 --> 41:27.820
the trend of sapienization.

41:27.820 --> 41:31.820
And that trend consists basically of gracilization,

41:31.820 --> 41:35.700
of making our ancestors less robust.

41:37.020 --> 41:40.700
Shorter faces, smaller teeth, smaller brow ridge,

41:40.700 --> 41:45.500
narrower face, thinner cranium,

41:45.500 --> 41:50.500
all these things that are associated with reduced violence.

41:51.900 --> 41:56.220
Okay, so that's saying that's Homo sapiens beginning.

41:56.220 --> 41:59.660
So it began sometime three to 400,000 years ago

41:59.660 --> 42:01.660
because by 315,000 years ago,

42:01.660 --> 42:03.420
you've already got something recognizable.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.260
So you're more on that side of things,

42:05.260 --> 42:06.780
that those are this gradual process.

42:06.780 --> 42:09.260
It's not 150, 170,000 years ago.

42:09.260 --> 42:13.620
It started like 400,000 years ago.

42:13.620 --> 42:14.460
And it's just.

42:14.460 --> 42:16.460
It started three to 400,000 years ago.

42:16.460 --> 42:19.980
And if you look at 170, it's got even more like us.

42:19.980 --> 42:23.540
And if you look at 100, it's got more like us again.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.380
And if you look at 50, it's more like us again.

42:25.380 --> 42:26.300
It's all the way.

42:26.300 --> 42:29.100
It's just getting more and more like the moderns.

42:29.100 --> 42:30.740
So the question is what happened

42:30.740 --> 42:32.540
between three and 400,000 years ago

42:32.540 --> 42:34.660
to produce Homo sapiens?

42:34.660 --> 42:38.060
And I think we have a pretty good answer now.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.100
And the answer comes from violence.

42:40.100 --> 42:44.060
And the story begins by focusing on this question.

42:44.060 --> 42:49.060
Why is it that in the human species,

42:49.060 --> 42:51.500
we are unique among all primates

42:51.500 --> 42:55.580
in not having an alpha male in any group

42:56.940 --> 42:59.580
in the sense that what we don't have

42:59.580 --> 43:03.780
is an alpha male who personally beats up every other male.

43:05.220 --> 43:10.220
And the answer that has been portrayed most richly

43:13.620 --> 43:18.620
by Christopher Bohm and whose work I've elaborated on

43:18.780 --> 43:23.780
is that only in humans do you have a system

43:24.620 --> 43:28.580
by which any male who tries to bully others

43:29.820 --> 43:33.220
and become the alpha equivalent to an alpha gorilla

43:33.220 --> 43:35.260
or an alpha chimpanzee or an alpha bonobo

43:35.260 --> 43:37.540
or an alpha baboon or anything like that,

43:37.540 --> 43:39.620
any male who tries to do that in humans

43:40.620 --> 43:44.460
gets taken down by a coalition of beta males.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.340
Mm-hmm.

43:46.660 --> 43:47.820
That coalition.

43:47.820 --> 43:49.260
Yes.

43:49.260 --> 43:52.100
That's a really good picture of human society, yes.

43:52.100 --> 43:52.940
I like it.

43:52.940 --> 43:55.580
Okay, so and that's the way all our societies work now.

43:55.580 --> 43:56.420
Yes.

43:56.420 --> 43:58.620
Because individuals try and be alpha

43:58.620 --> 43:59.980
and then they get taken out.

43:59.980 --> 44:01.940
Yeah, I mean, we don't usually think of ourselves

44:01.940 --> 44:06.380
as beta males, but yes, I suppose that's what democracy is.

44:06.380 --> 44:07.220
Exactly.

44:07.220 --> 44:08.040
Yes.

44:08.040 --> 44:08.880
Exactly.

44:09.840 --> 44:14.560
Okay, so at some point alpha males get taken out.

44:14.560 --> 44:16.200
Well, what alpha males are,

44:16.200 --> 44:20.600
are males who respond with high reactive violence

44:20.600 --> 44:22.720
to any challenge to their status.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.080
You see it all the time in primates.

44:25.080 --> 44:28.040
Some beta male thinks he's getting strong

44:28.040 --> 44:31.680
and maturing in wisdom and so on

44:31.680 --> 44:35.880
and he refuses to kowtow to the alpha male.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.320
And the alpha male comes straight in and charges at him.

44:39.320 --> 44:42.120
Or maybe he'll just wait for a few minutes

44:42.120 --> 44:44.320
and then take an opportunity to attack him.

44:48.560 --> 44:51.320
All of these primates have got a high tendency

44:51.320 --> 44:53.200
for reactive aggression

44:53.200 --> 44:56.400
and that enables this possibility alpha males.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.600
We don't, we have this great reduction

44:58.600 --> 45:00.400
as I talked about earlier.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.120
And the question is when did that reduction happen?

45:04.000 --> 45:08.520
Well, cut to the famous experiments

45:08.520 --> 45:12.280
by the Russian biologist Dmitry Believ

45:12.280 --> 45:16.280
who tried domesticating wild animals.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.880
When you domesticate wild animals,

45:19.880 --> 45:23.720
what you're doing is reducing reactive aggression.

45:24.640 --> 45:28.240
You are selecting those individuals to breed

45:28.240 --> 45:31.960
who are most willing to be approached by a human

45:31.960 --> 45:34.360
or by another member of their own species

45:34.360 --> 45:39.360
and are least likely to erupt in a reactive aggression.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.920
And you only have to do that for a few generations

45:42.920 --> 45:47.080
to discover that there are changes in the skull

45:47.080 --> 45:52.080
and those changes consist of shorter face, smaller teeth,

45:57.040 --> 45:59.320
reduced maleness.

45:59.360 --> 46:01.800
The males become increasingly female-like

46:03.160 --> 46:04.920
and reduced brain size.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.440
Well, the changes that are characteristic

46:08.440 --> 46:11.920
of domesticated animals in general compared to wild animals

46:11.920 --> 46:14.320
are all found in homo sapiens compared

46:14.320 --> 46:16.680
to our early ancestors.

46:16.680 --> 46:18.440
So it's a very strong signal

46:18.440 --> 46:21.080
that when we first see homo sapiens,

46:21.080 --> 46:24.240
what we're seeing is evidence of a reduction

46:24.240 --> 46:26.280
in reactive aggression.

46:26.280 --> 46:28.000
And that suggests that what's happening

46:28.000 --> 46:32.080
with homo sapiens is that that is the point

46:32.080 --> 46:35.480
at which there is selection against the alpha males.

46:35.480 --> 46:39.320
And therefore the way in which the selection happened

46:39.320 --> 46:41.480
would have been the way it happens today.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.960
The beta males take them out.

46:44.200 --> 46:49.040
So I think that homo sapiens is a species characterized

46:49.040 --> 46:53.280
by the suppression of reactive aggression

46:53.280 --> 46:55.360
as a kind of incidental consequence

46:55.360 --> 46:58.520
of the suppression of the alpha male.

46:58.520 --> 47:01.800
And the story of our species is the story

47:01.800 --> 47:04.080
of how the beta males took charge

47:05.800 --> 47:10.280
and have been responsible for the generation

47:10.280 --> 47:12.000
of a new kind of human.

47:13.400 --> 47:18.400
And incidentally, for imposing on the society

47:19.240 --> 47:24.200
a new set of values,

47:24.200 --> 47:26.720
because when those beta males discovered

47:26.720 --> 47:29.880
that they could take out the previous alpha male

47:29.880 --> 47:32.200
and continue to do so, because in every generation,

47:32.200 --> 47:34.040
there'll always be some male who says,

47:34.040 --> 47:35.440
maybe I'll become the alpha male.

47:35.440 --> 47:38.240
And so they just keep chopping them down.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.400
In discovering that, they also obviously discovered

47:42.400 --> 47:44.400
that they could kill anybody in the group,

47:45.400 --> 47:50.400
females, young males, anybody who didn't follow their values.

47:52.960 --> 47:57.960
And so this story is one in which the males of our species,

47:59.560 --> 48:01.440
and these would be the breeding males,

48:02.960 --> 48:06.800
have been able to impose their values on everybody else.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.080
And there is two kinds of values.

48:08.080 --> 48:10.040
There's one kind of value is things that are good

48:10.040 --> 48:12.360
for the group, like thou shalt not murder.

48:13.360 --> 48:15.560
And the other kind of value is things

48:15.560 --> 48:20.560
that are good for the males, such as, hey, guess what?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.920
When good food comes in, males get it first.

48:22.920 --> 48:23.760
Yes.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.960
I mean, it's fascinating that that kind of set of ideals

48:27.960 --> 48:31.400
could outcompete the others.

48:32.520 --> 48:35.920
Do you have a sense of why, or maybe you can comment

48:35.920 --> 48:38.720
on Neanderthals and all the other early humans,

48:39.200 --> 48:44.200
why did homo sapiens come to succeed and flourish

48:44.320 --> 48:47.600
and all the other ones, all the other branches

48:47.600 --> 48:51.720
of evolution died out or got murdered out?

48:51.720 --> 48:56.000
Nowadays, when homo sapiens meets homo sapiens,

48:56.000 --> 48:59.160
and we don't know each other initially,

48:59.160 --> 49:00.600
then conflict breaks out

49:00.600 --> 49:05.600
and the more militarily able group wins.

49:06.600 --> 49:09.920
We've seen that everywhere throughout the age

49:09.920 --> 49:13.160
of exploration and throughout history.

49:14.240 --> 49:18.920
So I'm rather surprised, the conventional wisdom

49:18.920 --> 49:23.080
that you see nowadays in contemporary anthropology

49:23.080 --> 49:28.000
is very reluctant to point to success in warfare

49:28.000 --> 49:32.360
as the reason why sapiens wiped out Neanderthals

49:32.400 --> 49:35.480
within about 3,000 years of the sapiens

49:35.480 --> 49:38.640
coming into Europe 43,000 years ago.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.200
And people are much more inclined to say,

49:42.200 --> 49:45.160
well, the Neanderthals were at low population density,

49:45.160 --> 49:48.160
so they just couldn't survive the demographic sweep

49:51.560 --> 49:54.240
or that the disease came in.

49:54.240 --> 49:56.520
Maybe those things might've been important,

49:56.520 --> 49:59.960
but far and away, the most obvious possibility

49:59.960 --> 50:04.120
is that sapiens were just powerful.

50:07.720 --> 50:10.320
Everyone agrees they had larger groups,

50:10.320 --> 50:14.480
they had better weapons, they had projectile weapons,

50:14.480 --> 50:19.280
bows and arrows to judge from the little microlyth,

50:19.280 --> 50:23.480
bits of flake, which the Neanderthals didn't.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.960
Nowadays, there's evidence of interbreeding,

50:29.000 --> 50:31.320
quite extensive interbreeding between sapiens

50:31.320 --> 50:35.120
and Neanderthals as well as with some other groups.

50:35.120 --> 50:37.240
And sometimes people say, well, you know,

50:37.240 --> 50:40.400
so they loved each other, they made love, not war.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.720
I think they made love and war.

50:42.720 --> 50:46.480
And it wouldn't necessarily have been too loving.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.240
I mean, if you just follow through

50:49.240 --> 50:51.680
from typical ethnographies nowadays

50:51.680 --> 50:55.400
of when dominant groups meets subordinate groups,

50:55.400 --> 50:56.840
they didn't know each other,

50:56.840 --> 51:00.520
then you can imagine that Neanderthal females

51:00.520 --> 51:02.400
would essentially be captured

51:02.400 --> 51:05.360
and taken into sapiens groups.

51:07.080 --> 51:12.080
Maybe you can comment on this cautiously and eloquently.

51:13.840 --> 51:18.200
What's the role of sexual violence in human evolution?

51:18.200 --> 51:21.480
Because you mentioned taking Neanderthal females,

51:21.480 --> 51:23.920
you've also mentioned that some of these rules

51:23.920 --> 51:28.760
are defined by the male side of the society.

51:28.760 --> 51:31.600
What's the role of sexual violence in this story?

51:33.080 --> 51:34.080
I think you've got to distinguish

51:34.080 --> 51:35.840
between groups and within groups.

51:37.600 --> 51:42.600
And I think the world has been slowly waking up

51:43.240 --> 51:46.000
over the last several decades

51:46.000 --> 51:51.000
to the fact that sexual violence is routine in war.

51:52.000 --> 51:57.000
And that to me says that it's just another example

51:58.720 --> 52:03.720
of power corrupts because when frustrated, scared,

52:06.520 --> 52:11.520
elated soldiers come upon females in a group

52:12.800 --> 52:16.360
that there's been essential dehumanization of,

52:17.400 --> 52:20.560
then they get carried away by opportunity.

52:21.840 --> 52:25.160
It is not always possible to argue

52:25.160 --> 52:28.600
that this is adaptive nowadays

52:28.600 --> 52:31.200
because you get lots and lots of stories

52:31.200 --> 52:36.200
of women being abused to the point of being killed.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.160
She'll be gang raped and then killed.

52:41.160 --> 52:46.160
There's lots of terrible cases of that reported

52:46.240 --> 52:47.840
from all sorts of different wars.

52:48.840 --> 52:53.840
But you can see that that could build on a pattern

52:54.880 --> 52:57.360
that would have been adaptive

52:57.360 --> 53:01.560
if happening under so much less extreme circumstances.

53:02.920 --> 53:05.200
The war is very extreme nowadays

53:05.200 --> 53:07.480
in the sense that you get battles

53:07.480 --> 53:11.280
in which people are sent by a military hierarchy

53:11.280 --> 53:14.160
into a war situation in which they do not feel

53:14.160 --> 53:16.480
what hunters and gathers would typically have felt,

53:16.480 --> 53:18.640
which would have been that if we attack,

53:18.640 --> 53:21.960
we have an excellent chance of getting away with it.

53:21.960 --> 53:25.880
Nowadays, you're sent in across the Somme or whatever it is

53:25.880 --> 53:28.680
and there's a very high chance you will be killed.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.320
And that's totally unnatural

53:30.320 --> 53:33.080
and a novel evolutionary experience, I think.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.160
Then there's sexual coercion within groups.

53:39.760 --> 53:42.120
So that takes various kinds of forms.

53:43.320 --> 53:46.440
But nowadays, of course, I think people recognizing

53:47.440 --> 53:52.440
that the principle form of sexual intimidation and rape

53:54.760 --> 53:57.080
occurs within relationships.

53:58.400 --> 54:03.400
It's not stranger rape that is really statistically important.

54:03.400 --> 54:08.400
There's much more what happens behind the walls

54:09.240 --> 54:14.240
of a bedroom where people have been living for some time.

54:14.960 --> 54:19.960
And just two sort of thoughts and observations about this.

54:20.920 --> 54:25.920
One is that it may seem odd that males should be,

54:32.160 --> 54:34.920
should think it a good idea as it were

54:34.920 --> 54:37.840
to impose themselves sexually

54:37.840 --> 54:40.200
on someone with whom they have a relationship.

54:41.200 --> 54:45.920
But what they're doing is intimidating someone

54:45.920 --> 54:49.320
in a relationship in which the relative power

54:49.320 --> 54:52.800
in the relationship has continuing significance

54:52.800 --> 54:54.320
for a long time.

54:54.320 --> 54:58.600
And that power probably goes well beyond just the sexual.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.880
It's to do with domestic relationships,

55:01.880 --> 55:06.160
it's to do with the man getting his own way all the way.

55:06.200 --> 55:09.800
It's power dynamics and the sexual aggression

55:09.800 --> 55:12.480
is one of the tools to regain power,

55:12.480 --> 55:14.880
gain power, gain more power and that kind of thing.

55:14.880 --> 55:16.680
Yeah, exactly.

55:16.680 --> 55:21.680
And in that respect, it's worth noting that

55:22.280 --> 55:25.680
although this wasn't appreciated for some time,

55:25.680 --> 55:28.320
it's emerging that in a bunch of primates,

55:28.320 --> 55:33.320
you have somewhat parallel kinds of sexual intimidation

55:33.840 --> 55:36.880
where males will target particular females,

55:36.880 --> 55:40.320
even in a group in which the norm is for females

55:40.320 --> 55:42.600
to mate with multiple males.

55:42.600 --> 55:44.960
But each male will target a particular female

55:44.960 --> 55:48.560
and the more he is aggressive towards her,

55:48.560 --> 55:52.240
then the more she conforms to his wishes

55:52.240 --> 55:54.320
when he wants to mate.

55:54.320 --> 55:56.960
So a long-term pattern of sexual intimidation.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.400
So there's that aspect.

55:59.400 --> 56:01.640
The other aspect I would just note is that

56:01.680 --> 56:06.680
males get away with a lot compared to females

56:10.200 --> 56:13.680
in any kind of intersexual conflict.

56:16.120 --> 56:19.920
So the punishment, here's one example of this,

56:19.920 --> 56:23.480
the punishment for a husband killing a wife

56:23.480 --> 56:25.600
has always been much less than the punishment

56:25.600 --> 56:27.120
for a wife killing a husband.

56:27.960 --> 56:32.160
And you see similar sorts of things

56:32.160 --> 56:37.160
in terms of the punishments for adultery and so on.

56:38.680 --> 56:42.960
I bring this up in the context of males

56:42.960 --> 56:47.200
sexually intimidating their partners,

56:47.200 --> 56:49.160
be it wives or whoever,

56:50.680 --> 56:54.360
because it's a reminder that it's basically

56:54.360 --> 56:57.800
a patriarchal world that we have come from,

56:57.800 --> 57:02.080
a patriarchal world in which male alliances

57:02.080 --> 57:06.280
tend to support males and take advantage of the fact

57:06.280 --> 57:09.760
that they have political power at the expense of females.

57:09.760 --> 57:12.000
And I would say that that all goes back

57:12.000 --> 57:14.800
to what happened 300,000 to 400,000 years ago

57:14.800 --> 57:16.680
when the beta males took charge

57:16.680 --> 57:19.160
and they started imposing their own norms

57:19.160 --> 57:22.520
on society as a whole and they've continued to do so.

57:22.520 --> 57:26.200
And we now look at ourselves and Jordan Peterson says,

57:26.200 --> 57:28.800
we are not a patriarchal society.

57:28.800 --> 57:33.000
Well, it's true that the laws try and make it even handed

57:33.000 --> 57:35.440
nowadays between males and females,

57:35.440 --> 57:38.680
but obviously we are patriarchal de facto

57:38.680 --> 57:43.680
because society still in many ways supports men

57:45.400 --> 57:48.040
better than it supports women in these sorts of conflicts.

57:48.040 --> 57:50.520
So beta male patriarchal,

57:51.880 --> 57:55.320
if we're looking at the evolutionary history.

57:55.320 --> 57:58.880
Okay, is there, maybe sticking on Jordan for a second,

57:58.880 --> 58:03.880
is there, so he's a psychologist, right?

58:04.440 --> 58:09.440
And what part of the picture do you think he's missing

58:09.960 --> 58:14.800
in analyzing the human relations?

58:15.800 --> 58:20.160
Like what does he need to understand

58:20.160 --> 58:22.400
about our origins in violence

58:22.400 --> 58:24.960
and the way that society has been constructed?

58:24.960 --> 58:29.960
Oh, I don't want to go deep into his missing perspectives,

58:30.360 --> 58:34.560
but I just think that what he's doing

58:34.560 --> 58:37.840
in that particular example is focusing

58:37.840 --> 58:41.080
on the legalistic position.

58:41.080 --> 58:46.080
And that's great that you do not find formal patriarchy

58:47.520 --> 58:49.720
in the law, anything like to the extent

58:49.720 --> 58:53.800
that you could find it a hundred years ago and so on.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.080
Women have got the vote now, hooray.

58:56.080 --> 58:58.680
But it took a long time for women to get the vote.

58:58.680 --> 59:03.680
And it remains the case that the women suffer

59:06.320 --> 59:08.720
in various kinds of ways.

59:08.880 --> 59:11.400
You know, a woman who is,

59:13.760 --> 59:17.960
has lots of sexual partners is treated much more rudely

59:17.960 --> 59:21.280
than a male who has lots of sexual partners.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.160
There are all sorts of informal ways

59:23.160 --> 59:27.240
in which it's rougher being a woman than it is a man.

59:27.240 --> 59:32.240
And if we look at the surface layer of the law,

59:32.600 --> 59:36.320
we may miss the deeper human nature,

59:36.800 --> 59:40.160
like the origins of our human nature

59:40.160 --> 59:42.600
that still operates no matter what the law says.

59:42.600 --> 59:47.120
Yeah, which is, you know, human nature is awkward

59:47.120 --> 59:50.960
because it includes some unpleasant features

59:50.960 --> 59:54.200
that when we sit back and reflect about them,

59:54.200 --> 59:57.920
we would like them to go away.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:02.920
But it remains the fact that men are hugely concerned

01:00:03.440 --> 01:00:08.440
to try and have sex with at least one woman

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.000
and, you know, often lots of women.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.240
And so men are constantly putting pressure on women

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.840
in ways that women find unpleasant.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.600
And if men sit back and reflect about it,

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.840
they think, yeah, we shouldn't do this,

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.200
but actually it just goes on because of human nature.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:30.840
So maybe looking at particular humans in history,

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.800
let's talk about Genghis Khan.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:38.120
Is this particular human who was one of the most famous

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.240
examples of large scale violence,

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.760
is he a deep representative of human nature

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.920
or is he a rare exception?

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.920
Well, I think that it's easy to imagine

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.440
that most men could have become Genghis Khan.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:02.240
It's possible that he had a particular streak

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.280
of psychopathy.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.400
You know, it's striking that by the time you become

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.160
immensely powerful, then your willingness

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.560
to do terrible things for the interest

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:27.560
of yourself and your group becomes very high.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.400
Stalin, Mao Zedong, these sorts of people have histories

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.520
in which they do not show obvious psychopathy.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.360
But by the time they are big leaders,

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.960
they are really psychopathic in the sense that

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.920
they do not follow the ordinary morality

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.920
of considering the harm that they are doing

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:53.960
to their victims.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.560
What kind of experiment would we need to discover

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.560
whether or not anybody could fall into this position?

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.560
I don't know, but you know, Lord Acton's famous dictum

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:09.880
was power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.120
And then the point that people often forget

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.680
is the next sentence that he said,

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.200
which is great men are almost always bad men.

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.160
And I think that that's a very important point.

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.800
He said, which is great men are almost always bad men.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.400
And that is right.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.880
It is very difficult to find a great man in history

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.040
who was not responsible for terrible things.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.920
I think there's some aspect of it

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.840
that it's not just power.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.280
I think men who have been the most destructive

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.280
in human history are not psychopathic completely

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:52.920
they have convinced themselves of an idea.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.520
It's like the idea is psychopathic.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.000
Stalin, for example, I don't,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.200
Hitler is a complicated one.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.440
I think he was legitimately insane,

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.000
but I think Stalin has convinced himself

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.960
that he's doing good.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:08.200
So the idea of communism is the thing

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.160
that's psychopathic in his mind.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.840
Like it bred, you construct the worldview

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.640
in which the violence is justified,

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:17.480
the cruelty is justified.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.360
So there, in that sense, first of all,

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.400
you can construct experiments, unethical experiments

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.800
that could test this, but in that sense,

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.840
anybody else could have been in Stalin's position.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.840
It's the idea that could overtake the mind of a human being.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.320
And in so doing justify cruel acts.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.120
And that seems to be at least in part unique to humans

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.520
is the ability to hold ideas in our minds

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.400
and share those ideas and use those ideas

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.760
to convince ourselves that proactive violence

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.120
on a large scale is a good idea.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.280
So that, I don't know if you have a comment.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.960
I suppose so, I mean, but seems to me

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:06.960
what really motivated Stalin was not so much communism

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.200
as the retention of power.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.120
So once he became leader and in the process

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.920
of becoming leader, he was absolutely desperate

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.120
to get rid of anybody who was a challenger.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.440
He was deeply suspicious, suspicious of anybody,

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.560
even on his side, who might possibly be showing

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:36.040
a glimmerings of willingness to challenge him.

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.040
So, you know, when he apparently had Kirov murdered,

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.520
Kirov was a great communist, Trotsky was a great communist,

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.440
you know, all his rivals, and I mean,

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.080
when he went into the towns and murdered people

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.240
by the tens of thousands.

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.200
They were all communists.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.160
A lot of them were explicit communists, that's right.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.360
But what he was worried about

01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:03.360
was that they were rivals to him.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.840
I suppose the thought is, I am the best person

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:13.840
to bring about a global sort of embrace of communism

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.600
and others are not, and so we have to get rid

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:19.680
of those others.

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.640
Well, I suspect you're being very charitable here,

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:25.120
but I mean, maybe you're, you know,

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.600
enough about Stalin to really-

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.920
Yes, well, so the point I'm making, I do quite a bit,

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.400
is from my understanding and sense,

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.200
of course, we can't know for sure,

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.680
is he believed in communism.

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.800
This wasn't purely a game of power.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:46.280
Now, he got drunk with power pretty quickly,

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:50.680
but he really believed for, I believe his whole life

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:54.080
that communism is good for the world.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.080
And that, I don't know what role that belief plays

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.840
with the more natural human desire for power.

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:06.160
I don't know, but it just seems like-

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.440
As we agreed, he's killing a lot of communists

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.440
on his journey.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:13.800
But it's not, that doesn't,

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.600
that calculus doesn't work that way.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.440
There's humans who are communists,

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.920
and then there's the idea of communism.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.760
So for him, in his delusional worldview,

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.360
killing a few people is worth the final result

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.760
of bringing communism to the whole world.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:33.800
But it was more than that, again,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.760
because, I mean, he really wanted power

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:40.520
for the Soviet Union, and so surely the reason that he,

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.200
he orchestrated the export of wheat from Ukraine,

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:53.920
and in so doing was willing to lead to mass starvation

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.080
was because he wanted to sell it on the market

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.560
in order to be able to build up the power

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.960
of the Soviet Union.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.640
You know, alternative view of communism might have been,

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.240
well, you know, let's just make sure everybody survives

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.640
and make sure everybody has enough to eat,

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:13.720
and we'll all be mutually supportive in a communal network.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.200
But no, but he wanted the power for the country.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.400
Well, I guess, exactly, so that it's not even communism,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.080
the set of ideas are like Marxism

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.120
or something like that, it's the country.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.520
I guess what I'm saying is it's not purely power

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:31.320
for the individual, it's power for a vision

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.880
for this great nation, the Soviet Union.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.360
And similar with Hitler, the guy believed

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.360
that this is a great nation, Germany,

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.600
and like it's a nation that's been wronged

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.000
throughout history and needs to be righted.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.480
And there's some dance between the individual human

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:55.600
and the tribe.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.360
Yes, no, absolutely, yes.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.040
And so just like chimpanzees, you know,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.120
we are fiercely tribal, and the tribalism resides

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.960
particularly in male psychology.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.400
And it's very scary because once you assemble

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.160
a set of males who share a tribal identity,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.400
then they have power that they can exert

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:26.720
with very little concern about what they're doing

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.880
to damage other people.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.920
Do you think this, so Nietzschean will to power,

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.120
we talked about the corrupting nature of power,

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.680
do you think that's a manifestation

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.840
of those early origins of violence?

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:46.040
What's the connection of this desire for power

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.000
and our proclivity for violence?

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.480
You know, what we're talking about is tribal power, right?

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:56.920
Power on behalf of a group.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.760
Yes.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.040
And yeah, that seems to me to go right back

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.520
to a deep evolutionary origin,

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.200
because you see essentially the same thing

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.480
in a whole bunch of animals.

01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:15.480
You know, most of the sort of cognitively complex

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.200
animals live in social groups

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.200
in which they have tribal boundaries.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.280
And so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed

01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.800
in almost all of the primates.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.760
The difference between us and, you know,

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.520
chimpanzees and humans on the one hand,

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.600
and other primates on the other,

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.280
is that we kill and they don't.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:42.920
And the reason they don't is because they never meet

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.000
in the context where there are massive imbalances of power.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.160
So two groups of baboons, you know,

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.600
there's 30 on this side and 50 on this side, fine.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.640
Nobody's gonna try and kill anybody else

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.560
because the serious risks involved.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.160
But nevertheless, they are tribal.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.160
So, you know, they will have fairly intense

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.640
intergroup interactions in which everybody knows

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.560
who is on whose side.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:17.560
And the long-term consequences of winning those battles,

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.720
non-lethal battles, is that the dominance get access

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.880
to larger areas of land, more safety and so on,

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.880
with chances are, better record of reproductive success

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.560
subsequently.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.760
Do you think this, from an evolutionary perspective,

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:46.760
is a feature or a bug, our natural sort of tendency

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:48.600
to form tribes?

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:50.680
So what's a bug?

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.400
Oh, sorry, this is a computer programming analogy.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:01.640
Meaning like, it would be more beneficial,

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.680
is it beneficial or detrimental to form tribes

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.120
from an evolutionary perspective?

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.880
Yeah, yeah, but...

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.000
What does it mean?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.120
What does a bug mean?

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.160
Yes, right, I mean...

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:17.440
Well, yeah, like where's evolution going anyway?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.800
It's beneficial in the sense that it evolved

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.320
by natural selection to benefit the individuals who did it.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:28.720
But if by bug you mean something that,

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.120
from the point of view of the species,

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.440
it would be great if you could just wipe this out

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:35.960
because the species would somehow do better as a result.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.440
Then yes, but then, you know, males are a bug.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:46.200
Come on now, there's some nice things to males,

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.160
speaking as a male.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.200
The fact that there are some nice things to males

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.200
doesn't mean that they're not bugs.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.920
Maybe they're quite nice bugs,

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.440
but it would be much better for the species as a whole

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.440
not to have to have males who impose this violence

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.880
on the species as a whole.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.120
Yeah.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.160
As somebody who practiced controlled violence

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:10.000
and doing a lot of martial arts, yeah, I'm not sure.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.040
It does seem kind of fun

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.280
to have this kind of controlled violence, also sports.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:18.440
Also, I mean, the question of conflict in general,

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:20.560
I guess that's the deeper question.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.200
Don't you think there's some value to conflict

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:27.720
for the improvement of society, for progress,

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.080
that this tension between tribes

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:35.240
isn't this like experiment,

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.640
a continued experiment we conduct with each other

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.200
and to figure out what is a better world to build.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.960
Like you need that conflict of good ideas and bad ideas

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:47.480
to go to war with each other.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.600
It's like the United States with the 50 states

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.640
and it's the laboratories of ideas.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.160
Don't you think that is, again, feature versus bug.

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.960
This kind of conflict, when it doesn't get out of hand,

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.680
is actually ultimately progressive, productive

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.720
for a better world.

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:10.080
Well, what do you mean by conflict?

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.880
I mean, you can have conflict in the sense of

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.520
people have different ideas about the solution to a problem.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.920
And so their ideas are in conflict.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.480
They can sit down on a log and chat about it

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.640
and then decide, okay, you're right,

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:27.080
or I'm wrong, or whatever.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.080
But if by conflict, you mean a great idea

01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.480
to build a nuclear bomb and set that off,

01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:39.600
then no, I don't see why it's a good idea

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.960
to have all this violence.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:48.520
Yeah, there's, I wonder, I mean, it's not a good idea,

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:52.280
but I wonder if human history would evolve

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.080
the way it did without the violence.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.760
Oh, I'm sure you're right.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.160
Probably humans would not have evolved

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.680
in the sense that we have.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:05.680
But I would hope that the course of violence in evolution

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:10.960
will continue in the way it has.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.480
So there's all sorts of indications

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:20.600
that the importance of violence has been reduced over time.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.520
And this is made famous in Steven Pinker's book,

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.320
but others have written about it too,

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.280
that the frequency of death from violence

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:37.200
in every country you look at has been declining.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:39.040
That's just great.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.840
And so the amazing thing about this

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.000
is that even when you take the death

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.800
due to the First World War and the Second World War,

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.080
the 20th century appears to have been statistically,

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.920
meaning rates of death per individual,

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.360
the least violent in history.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.240
So we haven't got very far down the course to nonviolence,

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.720
but I don't see why we shouldn't just carry on doing it.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.840
I think it's ridiculous, frankly, you know,

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.120
excuse my frankness, to say that violence is a good thing.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.840
I think that it would be a wonderful concept

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.680
if we could evolve somehow to a world

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.280
3,000 years from now where violence

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.760
is really regarded as simply appalling

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.920
and that they look back on our time

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.520
and can't believe what we were doing.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.880
Yeah, but of course, violence takes a lot

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.520
of different shapes as we start to think

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.280
deeper and deeper about living beings on earth.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.920
For example, the violence we commit

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.840
and the torture we commit to animals,

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.240
and then perhaps on the line,

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.440
as we've talked offline about with robots

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.360
and that kind of thing.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:52.640
So there's just so many ways to commit violence to others.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.480
And some people now talk about violence

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.000
in the space of ideas, which of course, to me at least,

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.840
is a bit of a silly notion relative to use that same V word

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:06.400
for the space of ideas versus actual physical violence.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.920
But it may be that a long time from now,

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.000
we see that even violence in the space of ideas

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:16.680
is quite a manifestation of that same kind of violence.

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.480
And so it is interesting where this is headed.

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:23.000
And I think you're absolutely right.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.560
A world, a nonviolent world does seem like a better world.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.600
I wonder if the constraints on resources

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.360
somehow make that world more and more difficult,

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.160
especially as we run out of resources.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.440
Well, it's got to be very, very different

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.160
from what we're doing nowadays.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:40.880
And it's unimaginably different.

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.800
If we could imagine it,

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.640
then maybe we could work towards it at the moment.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.480
Nobody knows how to work towards it.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.960
Well, that's kind of the stories of humans

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.640
is we don't really know the future.

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.200
We're trying to ad hoc kind of develop it as we go

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:57.040
and sometimes get into trouble as to violence.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:59.800
But George Orwell's vision in 1984

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:04.760
was of two or three world powers each so powerful

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:09.760
that nobody could destroy the other.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:16.080
But the notion of an evolutionarily stable relationship

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:20.120
among heavily armed world powers

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:25.120
just does not seem as though it's reasonable at all.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.320
That is to say, we've now got 170 or 190 nations

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.520
in the world dominated by a few big ones,

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.200
all with arms pointing at each other.

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:45.320
And the notion that we could just carry on

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.400
having peace talks and making sure

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.240
that these arms don't get involved

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:54.080
in some kind of massive conflagration

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:56.960
seems incredibly optimistic.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.160
Some kind of major change has to happen

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:03.160
whereby, and some people wouldn't like to see

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.080
all the weapons go, that'd be great.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.840
I'm a member of that sort of group

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.600
that tries to see that happen.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.080
It's gonna be very difficult to see it happen.

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.040
Another kind of concept is the nations themselves

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:21.040
will dissolve and will become one government.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.720
That itself is a terrifying vision

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:28.040
because the capacity for abuse by a single world power

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.720
would be so problematic.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.440
And in addition, how do you get there

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.160
without a war in the first place?

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.480
At the moment, we have no reasonable future in mind,

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.000
but I'm sure it's there somewhere.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.560
It's just that we haven't yet to find it.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.000
And a lot of people in the cryptocurrency space

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.640
argue that you can create decentralized societies

01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:52.280
if you take away the power from states

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.080
to define the monetary system.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:58.680
So they argue if you make the monetary system

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:01.240
such that it's disjoint from the control

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.920
of any one individual, any one government,

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.640
then that might be a way to form sort of ad hoc

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:08.000
decentralized societies.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.800
They just pop up all over the place.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.880
That's a really interesting technological solution

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.960
to how to remove the overreach of power from governments.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.000
Yes, right, absolutely.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.520
And it may well be that the future will emerge

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.640
out of some sort of quite surprising direction like that.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.160
Is it nevertheless surprising to you

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.240
that we have not destroyed ourselves with nuclear weapons?

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:36.480
So the mutually assured destruction

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.440
that we've had for many decades

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.760
from somebody who studies violence,

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.240
how does that make sense to you?

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.440
Well, I mean, I'm surprised only in the sense

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:50.440
that accidental, the fact that we have not had an accident

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.480
yet has been quite remarkable,

01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.720
because all the accounts are that we've come very close

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.280
to having very serious accidents

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.120
where people on either side have misread intentions

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.280
or apparent launches and so on.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.640
So yes, I think it is remarkable.

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:13.640
There is a nasty generalization that can be made

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:19.160
that the longer that powerful states go

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:23.440
without having wars, then the worse the war is afterwards.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.480
And you can sort of see that that kind of makes sense

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.080
because basically what's happening with these tribal groups

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.080
that the nations are at the moment is that after a big war,

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:39.080
like the Second World War,

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:42.200
they established new kinds of dominance relationships.

01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:45.760
And then during the periods of peace,

01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.760
what happens is that the de facto dominance relationships

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.520
change because some nations become poorer,

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.960
some become richer,

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.560
some become more militarily powerful and so on.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:02.280
Generally, economy and military goes hand in hand.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.520
So right now, China emerged from the war

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:09.520
as a relatively low status state and is now high status.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.000
So if these were chimpanzees,

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.120
what would happen is that you would predict a conflict

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.120
because you need to have a readjustment

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.240
of the formal dominance relationships

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:22.280
to recognize the new in practice dominance relationships

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.760
recognized by the economy and the military.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.200
So the longer that you have a period of peace

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:32.320
following a war, then the more these tensions

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.120
of unresolved changed dominance relationships build up.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.520
And the longer they take to occur,

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.520
then the more challenging are gonna be the conflicts.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.400
That's a terrifying view

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.440
because we've been out of conflict for quite a bit.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.280
That's right.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.680
Maybe it's building up.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.520
So it's a scary view.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.040
But on the other hand,

01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.640
things have changed hugely

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.760
with the advent of nuclear weapons

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:04.760
because at least that conforms to this psychology

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.760
that is very clear in other animals,

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.880
which is you don't want to get into a fight

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:11.120
if you are going to get hurt.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.560
So that's the whole principle of mad,

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.720
mutually assured destruction.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:18.680
And it's doubtless been why powerful nations

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.920
like America and Russia

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.520
have not used their nuclear weapons since 1945.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:32.160
So if we can overcome the problem of accidental launches,

01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:37.320
then maybe the fact of mad does fit into human psychology

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:40.120
in a way that means that we really will resolve

01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.520
our tensions without using them.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.440
But we haven't yet really faced that challenge.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:52.160
The Soviet Union collapsed because of the poor economy,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.160
but with China desperate to take back Taiwan

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:03.200
and America shifting its focus on the Pacific,

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.880
the potential for something going wrong

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.160
is clearly very high.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.440
So what's the hopeful case that you can make

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.840
for a long-term surviving and thriving human civilization,

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.080
given all the dangers that we face?

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.160
Well, I can't really exactly make one.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:27.160
I would just say that we're talking about the dangers.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.880
Obviously the dangers are there.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.560
But what I would sort of think about is the notion

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.560
that surprises come from all sorts of different directions.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:44.880
And I mean, you work in robotics

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.720
and I can well imagine that there will be advances

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.880
in robotics that in some way I can't even conceive

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:57.880
will somehow undermine the motivation for conflict.

01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.760
Something about by the time chips have been planted

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.600
in human brains and we're all instantly sharing information

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:07.560
in a way that we never did before,

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:12.040
will this change the nature of human existence

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:15.160
in such a way that these conflicts get resolved?

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.800
So remove the conflicts, but keep some of the magic,

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.640
the beauty of what it means to be human.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.800
So like still be able to enjoy life, the richness of life,

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.720
the full complexity of life,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:26.480
because you can remove conflict

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:30.480
by giving everybody a pill and then they go to sleep, right?

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.480
You still want life to be amazing, exciting, interesting.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:39.920
And so that's where you have to find the balance.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.000
Well, it's, yes, I mean, it's all science fiction stuff

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.760
and so how it's gonna work out totally unclear.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.080
I don't see any worry about the magic of life disappearing.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.920
I mean, first of all, you somehow get rid of males.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.080
I think you really need to get rid of males

01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.080
because males are the source of a major problem,

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.640
which is the lust for power and the resulting conflict.

01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.360
But you don't think the males are also source of beauty

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.200
and creation?

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.040
No, no, no.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.120
I mean, I don't have anything against males

01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.840
as individuals and that sort of thing.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:22.800
And males have clearly done a lot.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.040
I mean, they've been incredibly exploratory and creative

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.880
and what they've done in art and music has been wonderful

01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.120
and that sort of thing.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.280
On the other hand, I'm not sure there's anything

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.840
particularly special and I think that probably females

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.880
could do the same thing just as well when given the chance.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.320
Yes, including the dark stuff.

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.000
I mean, part of me is not understanding the,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.600
so there is evolutionary distinction between men and women,

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.720
but I tend to believe both men and women,

01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.640
if you look out into the future, can be destructive,

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.000
can be evil, can be greedy, can be corrupted by power.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.680
So if you move males from the picture,

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.520
which are historically connected to this evolution

01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:09.520
that we've been talking about,

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.840
that women are gonna fill that role quite nicely.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.880
And then it'll be just the same kind of process,

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:20.880
not the same, but it'll be new and interesting.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:26.280
There's a sense that the will to power, craving power,

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.040
committing violence is somehow coupled

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:32.560
with all the things that are beautiful about life.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.080
That if you remove conflict completely,

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.720
if you remove all the evil in the world,

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.920
it seems like you're going to,

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.560
you're not going to have a stable place

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.440
for the beauty, for the goodness.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:54.280
Like there's always has to be a dragon to fight

01:26:54.280 --> 01:26:56.120
for the way, if you look at human history,

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.800
now you can say, the reason I'm nervous

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.360
about a sort of utopia where everything is great

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.600
is every time you look through human history

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:08.440
when utopia has been chased, you run into a lot of trouble

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.440
or again, sneaks into this evil, this craving for power.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.600
Now you can say that's a male problem,

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.880
but I just think it's a human problem.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.080
And it's not even a human problem, it's a chimp problem too.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.640
It's life on earth problem,

01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:25.520
intelligent life on earth problem.

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:30.520
So like it's better to not necessarily get rid

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:34.560
of the sources of the darker sides of human nature,

01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.080
but more create mechanisms that the kindness,

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:41.760
the goodness as the goodness paradox, your book,

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:46.760
that that is incentivized and encouraged empowered.

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.240
Well, look, I don't think it would be utopia

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.600
if you got rid of the males.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.520
And certainly females are capable of conflict.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:03.240
I just think it's a gamble worth taking

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.840
if you could actually do it.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:07.080
You can certainly find females in history

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.280
who've done unpleasant things.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:13.480
But nevertheless, we have a very strong evolutionary theory

01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.480
which explains why males benefit more by having conflict

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.520
and winning conflicts than females do.

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:27.520
And so if we want to talk about reducing conflict,

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.960
then it would reduce it to get rid of males.

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:34.120
Now I understand this is a fantasy

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:36.080
and I think it's a fantasy

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.520
that people would be able to talk about fairly soon

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:41.920
because reproductive technology is getting to the point

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:46.920
where it's quite likely that human females could breed

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.240
without the use of males.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:55.200
And so there would be a sort of a potential dynamic

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.680
if everybody just agreed not to have any male babies.

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.720
It's a really interesting thought experiment.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:07.400
I will agree with you that if given two buttons,

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:09.600
one is get rid of all women

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.760
and the other button is get rid of all men.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:18.960
Realizing that I have a stake in this choice,

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.800
you're probably getting rid of all men.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.680
If I wanted to preserve earth

01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:28.440
and the richness of life on earth,

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.280
I would probably get rid of all men.

01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.120
I don't know.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.680
I don't think you have a stake in it.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.960
I mean, you're saying that because you're a man.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:38.520
But I don't see why being a man

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.360
should make you any more interested

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.640
in having a male future for the world

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:43.840
than a female future.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:46.000
You've got just as many ancestors

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.400
who were male as were female.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.320
Well, my problem is I'll have to die.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.080
Well, that's gonna happen anyway.

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.080
I know, but I prefer to die tomorrow, not today.

01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:00.560
I prefer to hit the snooze button

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.760
on the whole mortality thing.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.600
But it's interesting.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.560
But this is not suggesting that males have to die

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:06.800
in order to make room for females.

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.480
It's just, all you have to do is just say,

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:13.920
don't let's have any more males born.

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.760
Interesting.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:18.240
Of course, the difficulty is that because we're tribal,

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.200
some country, somewhere would say,

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.680
well, we're not gonna do that.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.640
And then guess what?

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.760
They'd take over because they're male.

01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:26.600
So that's why it's impossible to imagine

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.640
actually happening.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.520
You know what?

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.200
I'm gonna take that and actually think about it.

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:33.040
I don't know.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.440
I'm uncomfortable.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:39.280
There's a certain kind of woke culture

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.600
that I've been kind of uncomfortable with

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.520
because it's not women necessarily.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.880
It's more just, there's a lot of bullying I see.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.880
There's a lack of empathy and a lack of kindness

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:53.640
towards others that's created by that culture.

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.200
But you're speaking about something else.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:31:00.200
You're speaking about reducing conflict in this world

01:31:00.240 --> 01:31:04.440
and looking at the basics of our human nature

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:09.440
and its origins in the evolution of Homo sapiens

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:14.440
and thinking about which kind of aspects of human nature,

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:17.360
if we get rid of them, we'll make for a better world.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.240
It's an interesting thought experiment.

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:21.680
But it is only a thought experiment.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.880
I mean, it's got no practical meaning right now.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:29.880
And I take your point that males get a hard rap nowadays

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:36.600
in some ways because the balance of social power

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:42.480
is moving against

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:47.120
I mean, quite rightly and in a strong sense, of course,

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.080
against all the nasty things that males do.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:55.720
But what people sometimes fail to remember

01:31:55.720 --> 01:32:00.720
is that life is very hard for males who don't have the power,

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.680
who don't have money, who don't have access to women.

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:13.680
You know, I'm sympathetic to incels.

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:18.440
I'm not sympathetic to them using violence

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:20.240
to solve their problems.

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.280
But I am very sympathetic to the fact that

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.240
it's not easy simply to be told by

01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:34.720
well-off, feminist, middle-class people

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.120
that you shouldn't behave like this

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.360
or you shouldn't feel like this because you do.

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:42.400
Yes, it's who you are.

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.960
I mean, in general, just empathy and kindness,

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:51.960
male or female, I believe,

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.400
will be the thing that builds a better world.

01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:57.360
And that's practiced in different ways

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.680
from different backgrounds.

01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:01.560
But ultimately, you should listen to others

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:04.120
and empathize with the experience of others

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.480
and put more love out there in the world.

01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.360
Now that, hopefully, is the way to reduce conflict,

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:15.320
reduce violence, and reduce that whole psychological

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.800
experience of being powerless in this world,

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.520
powerless to become the best version of yourself.

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.360
And that, you know.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.440
Well, no one's gonna disagree

01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:27.160
with all those fine sentiments, right?

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.680
But that, yes.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.000
But that's an actionable thing

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.120
is actually practice empathy, right?

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:40.080
Like saying that somebody should be silenced

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.800
or just like this group is bad and this group is good.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.400
I just feel like that's not empathy.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.400
Empathy is understanding the experience of others

01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.960
and like respecting it.

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:57.240
I mean, that's what a better world looks like.

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.720
That's what the reduction of conflict looks like.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.680
It's like, as opposed to saying my tribe is right,

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.200
your tribe is wrong.

01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.720
Forget the violence and non-violence part.

01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.160
That, just that act of saying my tribe is right,

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:13.600
that tribe is wrong, removing that from the picture,

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.720
that's the way to make a better world.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.320
Like, that's the way to reduce the violence, I think.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.720
Not necessarily removing the people

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.160
who are causing the violence.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.960
You have to get to the source of the problem.

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.240
I don't mean the evolutionary source,

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:32.240
but just the mindset that creates the violence

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.920
is usually just the lack of empathy for others.

01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:40.440
Yeah, but you can't just teach that

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.520
because our evolutionary psychology

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.520
puts us in particular directions.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:49.520
So you don't think, do you think it's possible to learn

01:34:50.440 --> 01:34:53.960
through practice to resist the basics

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:56.880
of our evolutionary psychology, the basic forces?

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.840
Yeah, I mean, lots and lots of training,

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.080
lots and lots of education can do it.

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:09.240
The famously most peaceful society

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.880
that anthropologists have recorded

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:16.840
involves a tremendous amount of teaching,

01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:18.120
including some punishment.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.960
It's a society in Thailand.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.960
You have to beat it out of children to make them nice.

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.040
So there's carrot and steak.

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.320
The point is that you do not find societies

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.360
in which people are spontaneously

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:39.200
showing the kinds of behaviors

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:42.040
that we would all love them to show.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.320
It requires work.

01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:45.160
It requires work.

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:48.000
What is your book titled Goodness Paradox?

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.360
What are the main ideas in this book?

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.560
Well, the paradox is the fact that

01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:57.560
humans show extremes in relationship

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.480
to both violence and nonviolence.

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.240
And the violence is that we are one of these few animals

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.920
in which we use coalitionary proactive violence

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.720
to kill members of our own species.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.240
And we do it in large numbers,

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:14.760
just like a few other species.

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.960
And the nonviolence is we're particularly extreme

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.920
in how repressed we are in terms of reactive violence.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.000
And I told you the story of how we get there.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So what's so extraordinary about this is that

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:33.000
most animals are either high on both

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.480
or relatively low on both.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.400
So chimpanzees are high on proactive violence

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.080
and reactive violence.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:44.280
Bonobos are less than chimpanzees on both of those,

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.400
but still hundreds of times more

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.960
reactively aggressive than humans are.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
What we've done is retain proactive violence being high

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.280
and got reactive violence really being low.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.240
And so we have these wonderful societies

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:03.840
in which we're all so incredibly nice to each other

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:07.120
and tolerant and calm and can meet strangers

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:08.920
and have no problem about

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.800
leading to any kind of conflict.

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.280
At the same time as we are one of the worst

01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:21.880
killing machine species that's ever existed.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.280
So what's so extraordinary about this is that

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.920
if you look at the political philosophers

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.960
of the last few hundred years,

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:33.880
you've got this fight famously between Thomas Hobbes

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.280
and Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.400
or literally you've got the fight between their followers.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.800
So the followers of Hobbes say,

01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.840
well, Hobbes was right because he says

01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.240
that we are naturally violent

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.320
and you need a Leviathan, a sort of central government

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.680
or a king to be able to suppress the violence.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.840
So we're naturally horrid and we can learn to be good.

01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:58.240
Whereas Jean-Jacques Rousseau is interpreted

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:01.400
as saying the opposite, that we are naturally good

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.440
and it's only when culture intervenes

01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:08.360
and horrid ideologies come in that we become uncivilized.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.920
And so people have had this endless fight

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:15.920
between are we naturally corrupt or are we naturally kind?

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.720
And that has gone on for years

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:23.040
and it's only in the last two or three decades

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.240
that anthropologists like Christopher Bohm

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.360
and Bruce Knouft have said, look,

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.680
it's obvious what the answer is,

01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:30.400
we are both of these things.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.200
And what is so exciting now

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.920
is I think we can understand why we are both.

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.240
And the answer is we come from ancestors

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.720
that were elevated on proactive aggression,

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.760
that were hunters and killers,

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.400
both of animals and of each other.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:50.680
And you've got to include that as almost certain

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.920
from the past.

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.920
And then now we've taken our reactive aggression

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:02.520
and we've down-regulated it and that's given us power.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.800
It's given us power because once you get rid

01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.560
of the alpha male, once the beta males take over

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:13.360
and force selection in favor of a more tolerant,

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.080
less reactively aggressive individual,

01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:22.000
the effect is that our cultures suddenly become capable

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.920
of focusing on things other than conflict.

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.880
And so we have social groups in which individuals,

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.960
instead of constantly being on edge

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.320
in the way that chimpanzees are with each other,

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:38.320
are able to interact in ways that enable them

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.760
to share looking at a tool together

01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.040
or share their food together

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.240
or pass ideas from one to the other

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:49.560
or support each other when they're ill

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.880
or whatever the issue is, cooperate in ways

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.120
that make the group far more effective.

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:58.400
So you asked earlier, what did I think about

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.680
why sapiens was able to expand

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:04.240
at the expense of Neanderthals so dramatically

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.680
around 40,000 years ago?

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.280
And the answer is that whatever it was,

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.720
it had something to do

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.080
with the sapiens' ability to cooperate.

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.240
That was what gave them bigger groups.

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.680
That's what enabled them to have

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.840
a far more effective way of living.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.200
And I suspect it was to do with weapons

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.240
and military aspects.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:30.280
But even if it wasn't that,

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:35.120
the greater cooperation that sapiens were showing

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.880
would have been hugely important.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.400
So sapiens then had groups of,

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:42.080
who knows exactly how big they were,

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.080
but scores of people to judge from their remains,

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:52.840
whereas Neanderthals were living in widely separated

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:57.840
small groups of maybe as many as 15 or 20 people sometimes,

01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800
where they saw others so rarely

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:03.960
that they were inbreeding at high levels.

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:07.160
Fathers having babies with their daughters.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:09.760
Very different world.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.760
Very different world.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.280
And that's probably what our world was like

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:13.640
before we got sapiens.

01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.040
Before we got sapiens.

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.600
And it's fascinating that there was that kind of

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.960
violence against,

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:23.320
once you get rid of the alpha males,

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.400
you have now the freedom to have kindness amongst the beta.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.360
The beta males.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:34.480
Not kindness, but collaboration, that's the better word.

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.320
Yes.

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:36.520
Right, much more cooperation.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.120
Not just among the males,

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:38.960
among the beta males,

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.760
but also among the gamma males and the females.

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.600
Yeah.

01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.880
I don't know what a gamma male is,

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.520
but I imagine there's a whole alphabet.

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.240
Well, I don't know about a whole alphabet,

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:51.880
but I think the big layers are the married men

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.000
and the unmarried men.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.280
Because the married men had a problem

01:41:57.280 --> 01:41:58.960
with the unmarried men.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.200
Right, I mean, you see it in ethnographies

01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:03.240
of hunters and gatherers recently,

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:06.360
where the unmarried men would be given rules,

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.720
such as, I mean, a very extreme rule in Northern Australia

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.680
was you cannot come to the camp for months.

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:17.240
You have to go away and live somewhere out in the bush.

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:20.000
Because we don't want you anywhere near our wives.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.960
And then another kind of rule is,

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:25.040
if you are in the camp,

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:27.720
you must be in the firelight all the time.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.720
Otherwise, we don't know what you're doing out in the dark.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.920
So you really have us to control them,

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:36.960
because the men who had lots of wives

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:38.680
did not want those horrid bachelors

01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.320
sneaking around the place.

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.160
I love this.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.960
You also wrote the book titled,

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.520
Catching Fire, How Cooking Made Us Human.

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.760
What's the central idea in this book?

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.480
The subtitle, How Cooking Made Us Human,

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:56.320
refers not to homo sapiens, but to homo erectus.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.040
So human there means the genus homo.

01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:03.720
And homo erectus is the first full member

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:08.720
of the genus homo in the sense that it looked like us,

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:12.160
just with a sort of slightly more robust build

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.120
and a smaller brain.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:17.320
And the central idea of Catching Fire

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.040
is that it was the control of fire

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:27.040
that was responsible for the emergence of homo erectus,

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:30.760
and therefore the genus homo,

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.000
which happened two million years ago.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.280
And it was an evolution from

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.680
a line of australopithecines.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.360
And australopithecines are the creatures

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.320
from whom we evolved.

01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.840
They were present in Africa

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:57.040
from something like six or seven million years ago,

01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:01.520
up to, actually up to one million years ago,

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:04.720
and then a branch led off to homo

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:06.360
around two million years ago.

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.120
And the way to think of australopithecines

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:14.080
is that they were like chimpanzees standing upright.

01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:17.040
So they were erect bipedal walkers.

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.080
They were like chimpanzees in the sense that

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.320
they had brains about the size of a chimpanzee.

01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:28.040
They were literally about the body size of a chimpanzee,

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.400
a little bit smaller actually.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:34.320
And they had big jaws because they were still eating

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:36.880
raw food.

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.600
They had big teeth and big jaws.

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:41.800
And then around two million years ago,

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.280
the line of australopithecines,

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:47.160
which ended with an intermediate species,

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.440
a kind of missing link area,

01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:50.360
because it is not missing,

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:54.560
called habilis, sometimes called homo habilis,

01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:56.160
but more properly in my view,

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.960
called australopithecus habilis.

01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.480
That gave rise to homo erectus,

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:06.040
and homo erectus, here's how different it was.

01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:09.960
It had a smaller mouth,

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:13.240
a smaller jaw, smaller teeth,

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:17.800
and to judge from its ribs and pelvis, smaller gut.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.400
In addition, it had lost what australopithecines all had,

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.400
which was adaptations for climbing in the trees.

01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.120
And that meant that homo erectus

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:30.600
must've slept on the ground.

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:34.200
And since it slept on the ground,

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.840
it should have been able to defend itself

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:37.640
somehow against predators.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.720
And I can't think of any way that they could have done that

01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:40.880
unless they had fire.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.960
So there are two major clues

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.680
to why it was with homo erectus

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:55.120
that our ancestors first acquired the control of fire.

01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.760
One is the fact that they were clearly not sleeping in trees

01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.640
in the way that chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.000
and all the other primates do.

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:10.240
And the other is that there was this striking reduction

01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.000
throughout the gut,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.360
reduction in size of the mouth and the chewing apparatus

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.320
and in the gut itself.

01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:24.320
And that conforms to what we see nowadays about humans,

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.560
which is that our guts are about two thirds of the size

01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:31.960
of what they would be if we ate raw food

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.400
to judge by the great apes.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.520
So at some point in our evolution,

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:43.080
we acquired the skill of cooking

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.760
and skill of controlling fire.

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.720
At no time between two million years ago and the present,

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.880
do we see any changes in our anatomy

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.880
that can, as it were, justify the enormous change

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.200
that happens when you are an animal

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.160
that learns to control fire.

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.360
But at two million years ago,

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:07.280
we have exactly what you'd expect,

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:09.840
namely the guts becoming smaller

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.960
because the food is becoming softer

01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.600
and much more easy to digest.

01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:17.200
So you don't have to work so hard in your body to digest it.

01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:21.280
And as I say, a commitment to sleeping on the ground,

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:25.560
which I think you'd be absolutely crazy to do nowadays

01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:29.760
on a moonless night in the middle of Serengeti

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.240
unless you had fire.

01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.400
I've slept out quite a lot in various parts of Africa

01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.600
in the bush.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.400
And you will not catch me just lying on the ground

01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.440
in an area with lots of predators

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:43.880
unless I got a fire with me.

01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.120
You're going to get eaten.

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:49.080
You're gonna get terrified and you're gonna get eaten.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.000
Okay, so there's a million questions I want to ask.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.880
So one, is it very naturally coupled

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:59.520
the discovery of controlled fire and cooking with fire?

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.480
Is that an obvious leap?

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.320
Well, here's what we know.

01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:06.840
We know that all the animals that we've tested

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:10.680
like to eat their food cooked more than they like it raw.

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.160
So this is true for all the great apes.

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:14.280
We've tested them.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.360
That's fascinating, by the way.

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:18.440
Why is that?

01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:21.000
That's just like a property of food, I suppose.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:25.880
Yes, I think what it is is that animals are always looking

01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:30.880
for any kind of way to get food that is easier to digest.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.760
And there are various signals in the food

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:35.760
such as the amount of sugar there,

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:37.920
the amount of free amino acids

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.720
because the amino acids can be tasted.

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:44.640
And the physical qualities of the food

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.440
be particularly important, how tough the food is.

01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:52.160
Always prefer softer food, provided it feels safe,

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.000
tastes safe.

01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:57.800
And these kinds of sensory cues

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:00.400
are all there in cooked food.

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:04.920
It's soft, it doesn't have so many toxins,

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.480
it's not so noxious to taste, easier to chew.

01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:11.920
So everyone loves it spontaneously.

01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:14.520
Your dogs and your cats prefer cooked food to raw food.

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:15.680
Well, maybe you can say

01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.360
that's a consequence of domestication,

01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.240
but even, as I say, all of the great apes,

01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.880
you test naive ones and they prefer it cooked, if they can.

01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:28.000
So then obvious, once you have fire,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:29.600
you're going to accidentally discover

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.520
that food changes when you apply fire to it

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:37.520
and then it's going to be the big, crazy new fad.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:39.560
You took the words out of my mouth.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.720
If they have fire at all and their food rolls into it,

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.840
five minutes later, it tastes better than it did before.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:50.360
How big of an invention from an engineering perspective

01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.040
do you think is the discovery of fire?

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:58.040
Do you think for Homo erectus, Homo sapiens,

01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.680
do you think it's the greatest invention ever?

01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:09.160
Yeah, I think that the control of fire

01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.240
has been ultimately responsible for essentially

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:17.320
how grandiose do I want to be here.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.400
The entire human story, going back to Homo,

01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:25.880
it is what changed us from being a regular kind of animal.

01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:28.640
And perhaps the biggest way

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.760
in which it is likely to have changed us

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.760
is it reduced the difficulty of making a large brain.

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:42.760
So the story here is that the constraints on brain size

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.000
are energetic.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.640
You and I have brains

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:54.640
that are something like 2.5% of our body weight.

01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:02.080
It consumes around 25% of all of our calories.

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.480
So it's disproportionate.

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:08.600
There are other expensive organs in our bodies as well,

01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.760
such as the heart.

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.320
And what's different about the brain

01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:18.800
is that in addition to us being able to fuel it

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.200
in a way that other animals can't,

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:25.000
we also have reasons for wanting to have an even bigger brain,

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.040
whereas we don't want an even bigger heart.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.040
So what those reasons are is unclear,

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:36.040
but with regard to the costs of maintaining a brain,

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.600
cooking makes it possible

01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:42.640
because it's supplying more calories

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.040
and it is enormously reducing the amount of time

01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:48.520
that it takes to chew your food.

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:49.840
So if you were a gorilla

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:53.360
and you wanted to have a bigger brain,

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.920
you might say, okay, well, let's just eat some more.

01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:01.920
But gorillas are eating for pretty much the entire day

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.480
in the sense that they're eating for maybe seven

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.480
or eight hours a day in some seasons.

01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.320
That's just chewing.

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:13.720
And then they've got to sit around and digest their food

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.640
because they can't just eat all the time.

01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:17.280
They've got to take a break

01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:21.680
while the food is digested in the stomach

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:23.840
and then passed into the gut.

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.880
So the stomach is already full.

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.120
So basically gorillas are eating

01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:31.240
about the maximum rate already.

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.520
So how does a gorilla get a bigger brain?

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:34.640
It doesn't.

01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:36.120
It's actually got a smaller brain

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.120
relative to its body size than a chimpanzee does.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:44.120
And that's the basic problem for our ancestors.

01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:47.240
Then you come along and cook and all of a sudden

01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.920
you can get an increased amount of energy from your food.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:55.600
You are spending much less energy on digesting your food.

01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:00.320
There are 25 bodily processes or more

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:03.280
that are involved in digesting your food,

01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:06.920
making the acid that takes the proteins apart,

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.480
maintaining the brush border

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:14.160
where the molecules are taken across the gut wall and so on.

01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.320
That all costs.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.960
It costs you to digest your food.

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.600
It costs less if you cook your food.

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:22.800
So you get a net gain in the amount of energy.

01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:27.200
And you are reducing the amount of time from,

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:29.120
in our case, our ancestors,

01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:32.960
probably around 50% of the day chewing

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:36.440
to nowadays one hour a day chewing.

01:53:36.440 --> 01:53:38.240
So all of a sudden you've got hours a day

01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.800
in which to do other things,

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:44.240
to use those brains that you've now enabled to grow.

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.640
So with Homo erectus,

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.960
you start the process of getting a bigger brain

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.400
and famously, you know,

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.280
throughout the whole period of the evolution

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.520
of the genus Homo,

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:56.160
you have a steadily increasing size of brain

01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.920
until right at the end when it actually gets smaller,

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.440
but that's a different story.

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:04.040
Which end is this?

01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:06.240
Which, are we talking about Homo sapiens?

01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:07.840
Yeah, with Homo sapiens,

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.680
you've got a smaller brain from,

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:13.200
people haven't got it exactly down,

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:17.240
but at least 30,000 years ago, it starts declining.

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:20.440
And so the fascinating thing about that

01:54:20.440 --> 01:54:23.440
is that all domesticated animals have smaller brains

01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:25.480
than their wild ancestors.

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:27.360
And I...

01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:30.720
The domestication is intricately connected

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:32.280
to this brain size, you think?

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.600
And exactly.

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.160
So I think what we're seeing in humans

01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:37.800
is that same manifestation.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:41.400
And then the fascinating question is why.

01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:43.600
And the only point I would want to make about this

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:46.840
is that there is no evidence that

01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:49.640
in the small brain domesticates,

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:53.440
they're losing, say, an average of about 15% of brain size.

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.520
In the small brain domesticates compared to Homo sapiens,

01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:58.000
in the small brain domesticates compared

01:54:58.000 --> 01:54:58.840
to their wild ancestors,

01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:02.640
there's no indication of a loss of cognitive ability.

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:08.480
So I think what's going on is that it's a younger brain,

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:10.680
it's a more pedomorphic brain,

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.920
looking like the juveniles of the ancestor,

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.480
but just as our kids are very smart

01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.920
and can learn amazing things compared to adults,

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.840
all they lack is wisdom and maturity,

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.560
but in terms of sheer cognitive ability, they got it.

01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.600
And I think that's the same with domesticated animals

01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:28.840
compared to their wild ancestors,

01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.640
and probably, therefore, with Homo sapiens,

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.840
say 30,000 years ago, compared to their ancestors.

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:39.200
So we have smaller brains than Neanderthals.

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.360
Size, Richard, isn't everything.

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.200
Exactly.

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:47.840
What's the connection between fire, cooking,

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:50.480
and the eating of meat?

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:53.160
Which came first, do you think?

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.960
Are humans starting to enjoy the eating of meat

01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.480
or the invention of fire and the use of fire for cooking?

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:04.400
I think that fire increased the use of meat,

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:09.400
but the fact that chimpanzees really like to hunt

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:14.760
and kill meat, as do bonobos, certainly puts us in...

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:18.320
Those two species have a common ancestor

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:20.600
with us going six, seven million years ago,

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:22.240
and it was from that common ancestor

01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:24.160
that you get the Australopithecine line.

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.360
It's very likely, therefore, Australopithecines

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.320
were eating meat when they could get it,

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:29.360
which wouldn't be very often

01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:31.960
because they wouldn't be very good sprinters,

01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.480
but nevertheless, they would occasionally be able

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.560
to get some meat, and I bet they loved it all the time.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.320
And basically, all primates like meat if they can get it,

01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:40.320
almost all of them.

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:45.600
But I think fire would have been very important

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:48.000
for a couple of reasons.

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:53.040
One is that once you eat your food cooked,

01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.680
then you're saving yourself time.

01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:57.440
By saving yourself time,

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.440
you can free up the opportunity to go and hunt more

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.360
because hunting is a high-risk, high-gain activity.

01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:10.680
There's every risk that you will get nothing

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.000
on one particular afternoon that you go off

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:16.560
looking for opportunities to kill,

01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:20.120
but it's high-gain because when you do get something,

01:57:20.120 --> 01:57:21.840
you bring down a kudu,

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:24.360
then you've got a serious amount of meat.

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:29.920
What did males and females do with the time they were saving

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:32.720
from not having to chew their food?

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:35.320
I think that in the case of males,

01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.720
it's very reasonable to think they spent

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.560
a greatly increased amount of time hunting.

01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:44.280
So chimpanzees, they hunt maybe two or three times a month,

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.520
and the average hunt length is 20 minutes.

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:52.560
With humans, they're hunting maybe 20 times a month,

01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.800
and the average hunt length is six hours.

01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:56.960
It's a huge difference.

01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.440
And that's possible because the time was available

01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:01.800
because they were cooking.

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:03.440
Less chewing, more hunting.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.120
You got it.

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:10.120
The other thing is that the meat is so much nicer.

01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.520
Yeah.

01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:14.200
So when a chimpanzee kills a monkey,

01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:17.640
and I mean, they are so excited about killing a monkey.

01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:19.480
They are so excited about going into the hunt,

01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:22.040
and when they make the kill,

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:23.920
then there's screams everywhere,

01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:27.520
and some try to seize it and capture it

01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.840
and take it away from the others,

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:32.080
and eventually the strongest one has it,

01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:34.080
and the others sit around begging

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.840
and trying to get some and tear it off,

01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:37.640
and so they all love it.

01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:41.560
There are others who, he often goes to the top of a tree

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:42.600
in order to be able to get away

01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:44.680
from all of these beggars and scavengers,

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:48.040
and while he's there, drops of blood

01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.400
or little scraps fall down to the bottom,

01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:52.920
and the junior members of society,

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:55.400
the females and young and that sort of thing,

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:58.760
they are racing through to find a particular leaf

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.720
that's got a drop of blood on it so they can lick it.

01:59:00.720 --> 01:59:02.160
I mean, they love it,

01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:08.080
but it takes them a lot of time to chew it.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:11.480
I mean, it's the same thing as for cooked food in general,

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:16.480
so they are getting meat very slowly into their bodies,

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:19.560
and there sometimes comes a time when they just say,

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.040
I've had enough of this, I need real food,

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:25.920
and they'll drop the meat and go off and eat fruit again,

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:28.000
because they can get fruit into their bodies

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
so much faster than they can get meat.

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:34.840
So once they're cooking, that problem is solved,

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:37.320
and they can eat the meat much more readily.

01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:40.200
So I think that meat eating would become important

01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.400
for two reasons with cooking.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:45.880
So the key, not to oversimplify,

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:48.560
but the key moments in human history

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:52.800
are with the Homo erectus, the discovery of fire

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.240
and the use of fire for cooking,

01:59:55.240 --> 02:00:00.240
and then with Homo sapiens, the beta males

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:01.960
killing off the alpha males

02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:04.040
so that the cooperation can exist,

02:00:04.040 --> 02:00:07.680
and cooperation leads to communication and language

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:10.760
and ideas, the sharing of ideas, that kind of thing.

02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:13.760
Well, yes, the only thing I would modify on that

02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:16.640
is that you have to ask how is it

02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:19.960
that the beta males were able to kill the alpha male?

02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:25.680
And we now know that although chimpanzees do kill males

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.800
within their own group sometimes,

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:31.320
it's not a process of killing the alpha male.

02:00:31.320 --> 02:00:33.120
It's taking advantage of opportunity

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:36.320
when some male gets into a bad position,

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:39.400
but it's not a systematic ability to kill the alpha male.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:42.920
And you can see why, because they don't have language.

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.520
And without language, it's very difficult to know

02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:50.160
how confident you can be of the support of others

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:53.920
against a particular individual within your own group.

02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:55.680
When you're attacking someone from another group,

02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:57.200
that problem is solved.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:01.640
We all hate the, you know, those guys.

02:01:01.640 --> 02:01:06.720
But the alpha male has got alliances within his group.

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.600
Some of those allies might be willing to turn against him.

02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:15.360
Some of them might be harboring deep feelings of resentment.

02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.840
But how does anyone else know that?

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.200
So in other words, I think that you have to have

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.840
some kind of language that is pretty good

02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:27.800
to solve the problems of gaining confidence

02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.640
that five of you say, you know, or some number

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:38.560
can trust each other in this final attack.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.800
And, you know, even nowadays it's difficult.

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:44.280
You know, when you mentioned Stalin,

02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.440
it's like, why was everybody terrified?

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.240
Any dictator that takes control,

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.280
why is all of us as individuals terrified

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.040
when you know there's millions of us?

02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:57.040
That's right.

02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.040
And so like that, we lack the language

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:04.440
because our basic psychology of fear overtakes us.

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.200
Like, who can we talk to?

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:08.640
Who can we talk to and not get killed ourselves?

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.440
Exactly, that's right.

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:14.160
But do you have this intuition that some kind of language

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.640
was developing along with this process

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:20.160
of beta males taking over?

02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:23.680
Yes, yes, I mean, once you have sufficient language

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:25.760
to be able to have the beta males conspiring

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.080
to kill the alpha male, then you have selection

02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:33.880
in favor of cooperation and tolerance as we spoke about.

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:38.160
And at that point, there will be increased ability

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.960
to communicate and the language will get richer

02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.600
and better and better.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.320
So yes, absolutely, positive feedback loop

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.960
once you get the situation started.

02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:52.960
Can you maybe comment on the full complexity

02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.760
and richness of the human mind through this process?

02:02:55.760 --> 02:03:00.640
We've been casually saying cooking, fire,

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.640
and beta males leading to cooperation.

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.600
But how does the beauty of the human mind

02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:10.680
emerge from all of this?

02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:13.080
Is there other further steps we need to understand

02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:16.520
or is it as simple as this language emerging

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:21.280
from taking over the alpha male and the cooperation?

02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:23.840
Or am I also over romanticizing

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.800
how amazing the human mind is?

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:27.680
Is it just like one small step

02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.240
in a long journey of evolution?

02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:34.600
Well, if the beauty of the human mind

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.600
is the ability of us all to be creative,

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:44.920
to explore, that's one kind of beauty.

02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.280
Another kind of beauty is the empathy that we can show.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.080
And we think of that as beautiful

02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:03.080
because it is a kind of rare and special ability

02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.480
compared to the sort of ordinary selfishness

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:12.400
that can commonly predominate.

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:17.240
I suppose we have to think of different sources

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.080
for those two types.

02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.560
I suppose a general answer is that

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:29.160
there has been selection in favor of bigger brains,

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:31.920
which probably in general has been associated

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.840
with increasing cognitive ability.

02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:35.880
And as that has happened,

02:04:37.040 --> 02:04:41.120
the complexity of life has increased

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:45.920
because people have more and more complex,

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:48.440
highly differentiated strategies

02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:51.320
in response to each other's more complex,

02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:53.560
highly differentiated strategies.

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.800
We get to a point where there is deception

02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:57.960
and self-deception.

02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:02.840
There is a manipulation of ideas

02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:05.240
through stories that we invent

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:07.200
and stories that we pass on.

02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:12.160
I guess all I'm wanting to say is that

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:17.240
there is a world of the mind

02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:21.120
that evolves in response

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:25.880
to these platforms that are put there.

02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:28.720
The platform of increasing brain size

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:30.120
and therefore cognitive ability

02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:34.120
made possible by increased energy supply.

02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:38.960
The platform of cooperation and tolerance

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:42.920
in a world in which there remains a lot of conflict

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:46.480
and therefore a need to respond to the conflict

02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:49.080
and manipulate your allies appropriately.

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:52.520
I don't see beauty as coming,

02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:53.800
either kind of beauty is coming

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:55.960
sort of totally independently of these things.

02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:58.800
I don't think there's a selection

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:02.440
for staring into the sunset and creating poetry.

02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:06.320
But I guess sexual selection,

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:10.440
males wanting to impress females in different ways

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.720
will lead to them wanting to-

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:15.200
Write poetry?

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:16.800
Well, yes, show off.

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:18.560
Yeah, in all the different ways.

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.680
So all of these are natural consequences

02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:24.840
of just coming up with strategies of how to cooperate

02:06:24.840 --> 02:06:27.280
and how to achieve certain ends.

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.920
So that's just like a natural-

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.000
Yeah, I mean, we haven't spoken about sexual selection,

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.320
but that is a really important part of it.

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:37.400
They try to out-compete each other

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:42.400
in normally without any physical conflict

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:45.120
just in order to be able to be chosen

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:46.960
by mates of the opposite sex.

02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:51.280
And that is certainly a major source of creativity.

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:56.240
So you've studied chimps.

02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.360
All the other relatives, gorillas,

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.960
what do you find beautiful and fascinating about chimps,

02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.800
about gorillas, about humans?

02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:05.760
Maybe you can paint the whole picture,

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:08.520
that evolutionary, that little local pocket

02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:09.920
of the evolutionary tree.

02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.280
How are we related?

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.200
What is the common ancestor?

02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:15.720
What are the interesting differences?

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:17.320
I know I'm asking a million questions,

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:22.320
but can you paint a map of what are chimps, gorillas

02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:25.160
and humans, like how we're related

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:27.360
and what you find fascinating about each?

02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:32.720
In Africa, straddling the equator,

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.280
there is a strip of rainforest

02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:42.280
that relies on the combination of high temperatures

02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:45.120
and rainfall that you get around the equator.

02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:50.720
That rainforest goes into about 22 countries.

02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:53.680
And throughout those countries,

02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:55.120
you have chimpanzees,

02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:57.280
although they've gone extinct in two of them.

02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:04.960
Just a fraction of them, five countries,

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:09.960
you've got gorillas, where there are mountains.

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.880
And in one country, on the left bank

02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:15.840
of the Great Congo River, you have bonobos.

02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:19.040
So in the African forest,

02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:20.840
you've got these three African apes,

02:08:20.840 --> 02:08:22.120
the only African apes,

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:28.120
all of which are very similar in much of their way of life.

02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.960
They walk on their knuckles through the forest,

02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:37.200
looking for fruit trees and eating herbs

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.640
when they can't find fruits.

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:46.000
Gorillas represent the oldest chain.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.960
So about 10 million years ago,

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:51.720
maybe as recently as eight million years ago,

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:54.040
the ancestor of gorillas broke off

02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:57.280
from the ancestor leading to chimps and bonobos and humans.

02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:00.800
So they've probably remained very similar now

02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:04.680
to what they were then.

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.960
They were probably the largest apes

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.840
living in mountain areas and spending more time

02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.840
eating just herbs, stems,

02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.320
not so vitally dependent on fruit.

02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:26.840
And living in, if it was like the present,

02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:30.600
groups up to about 50 stable groups

02:09:30.600 --> 02:09:34.320
with one alpha male who was in charge.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Gorillas are wonderfully slow and inquisitive

02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.360
compared to chimps and bonobos.

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.320
I had the privilege of spending a week or two

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:58.000
with gorillas at Diane Fosse's camp

02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.120
before she was murdered.

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:05.120
And I went out with two women, Kelly and Barb,

02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.320
to a particular group.

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:14.120
And there was a young female in the group called Simba.

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.040
And Simba approached us

02:10:16.600 --> 02:10:18.280
and stared at the two women.

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.920
And then she came towards me

02:10:20.920 --> 02:10:25.920
and she very deliberately reached out her knuckles

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:28.520
and touched me on the forehead.

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:34.200
She was watched in doing this by a young male

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:36.040
who was quite keen on her.

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:38.000
And he was called Digit.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.360
And about five minutes later,

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:44.120
Digit stood in front of us on the path

02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:46.920
and Kelly was in front of me.

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:50.200
And then there was Barb, and then there was me.

02:10:50.200 --> 02:10:51.840
And he came charging down the path

02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.880
and he sidestepped around Kelly

02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.040
and he sidestepped around Barb.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.560
And me, he just knocked with his arm

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:02.680
and sent me flying about five yards into the bushes.

02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.840
And I loved the way that that was a very deliberate response.

02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:11.960
And I loved the way that Simba had been so interested in me

02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:14.200
and held my eye.

02:11:14.200 --> 02:11:16.840
Chimps and bonobos never hold your eye,

02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:18.600
but gorillas really look as though

02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:19.800
they're trying to sort of figure out

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.760
what are you thinking about?

02:11:23.880 --> 02:11:27.480
That was a species that goes back

02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:29.560
for something like 10 million years.

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:33.320
And in that situation, was there a game being played?

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:38.360
Well, I mean, I felt that Digit was telling me

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.360
I don't want you messing with Simba.

02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:43.560
But was Simba using you?

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.680
Oh, I see.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:46.360
Well, that's a fun idea.

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:48.200
I don't see why she should be using me,

02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:51.160
but you mean testing how strongly

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:53.080
Digit was prepared to intervene to.

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:53.720
Yeah, exactly.

02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:56.200
Oh, that's come straight out

02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:58.200
of a sort of adolescent high school playbook.

02:11:58.200 --> 02:11:59.720
All right, well, that's all.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.400
No, no, no, there's nothing wrong with it for that.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:03.960
Yeah, I don't know.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.520
I never thought of that and you never know.

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:08.920
It's possible.

02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.960
So, yeah, okay, so this is an ancient branch

02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:17.560
of the evolutionary tree that led to gorillas.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:20.600
So then the next thing that happened

02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:23.640
on the evolutionary tree was six or seven million years ago

02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:29.960
when you have the line between chimps and bonobos

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.320
on the one hand and humans on the other splitting.

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:36.680
And basically what happened is that at that point,

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.280
a chimp-like ancestor leaves the forest,

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.000
gets isolated in an area outside the forest and adapts,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.600
and that becomes the Australopithecines.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:48.040
And meanwhile, the chimpanzees

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.800
and bonobo ancestor continues in the forest.

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:57.560
And later what happens is that one branch of that

02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.640
crosses the Congo River and becomes the bonobos.

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:02.680
That was only about two million years ago,

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:03.800
maybe one million years ago.

02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:07.080
Now, the chimps that remained in the forest throughout this time

02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:11.320
and occupied all the countries across from West to East Africa now,

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:14.840
again, we assume that they're pretty similar

02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:20.120
to the ones that live nowadays where there's some variation from West to East.

02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:24.520
And these are animals that live in social communities

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.760
of between, say, 20 and 200.

02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:31.080
They have a lot of them in one group,

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.600
but they never come together in a single unit.

02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:39.160
They share an area, a community territory,

02:13:39.720 --> 02:13:41.640
and that area is defended by males.

02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:45.240
And within it, females wander and bring up their young independently.

02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:52.920
And the females are very scared about the possibility

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:55.640
that males will be mean to their infants.

02:13:55.640 --> 02:13:58.600
And in order to avoid them doing that,

02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:04.520
they do their best to mate with every single male in the group multiple times,

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:07.400
as if to give a memory in that male of,

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.120
yeah, yeah, I remitted you, so I'm not going to be mean to your baby.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:12.840
So what's wonderful about chimps?

02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:19.400
Well, as we've spoken about them, they are creative and amazingly human-like.

02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:22.920
But I love the quiet moments.

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:23.720
And here's one.

02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:32.840
I've got two chimps who are grooming each other on a day when they are utterly exhausted.

02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:38.920
They've walked 11 kilometers the day before, up and down hills.

02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:45.560
And on this particular day, all they do is they get to one tree and they eat from that tree.

02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:48.280
And other than that, they only walk about 100 yards

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.240
and they go back to sleep in the nest in which they woke up.

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:56.440
So they're utterly exhausted and they're just eating nonstop

02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.520
because they're trying to recover their energy.

02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:02.680
And this is Hugh and Charlie.

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.120
And we think they were probably brothers,

02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:07.480
though we never actually got the genetic evidence to prove it.

02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:11.480
Well, I never remember now who it is,

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:16.360
but let's say that they both come down from the tree

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:22.440
and they're both carrying branches of the food.

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.360
They're actually seeds from these branches.

02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.120
They're both engaged even in the midday sun.

02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:32.840
When they want to come down and unshade themselves for a bit on the ground,

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:34.760
they're still eating.

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:40.840
But then Charlie finishes his branch and he starts grooming Hugh.

02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:46.360
And Hugh continues eating from his branch.

02:15:47.800 --> 02:15:51.400
Charlie eventually gets bored of this after a few minutes,

02:15:52.120 --> 02:15:59.240
and he reaches out and he lifts the branch from which Hugh is still taking seeds

02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:06.280
and puts it over his head and puts it behind his back as far as possible away from Hugh.

02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:08.760
Hugh doesn't do anything.

02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:14.840
He just finishes his mouth full and then he turns to Charlie and grooms him.

02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:18.680
So this very polite way of saying, will you groom me, please, has worked.

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:28.280
Then Hugh grooms around Charlie's back and around to the right side

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:32.200
and then down his arm to what point where he can reach the branch again.

02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:35.480
And then he picks up the branch and continues.

02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:37.160
Nonchalantly.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:37.560
Right.

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:37.960
Yeah.

02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:41.880
So in other words, a very sort of simple little strategy,

02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:46.200
but it just shows the courtesy with which they can treat each other.

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:50.280
And the days I love with chimps are when you see that sort of thing,

02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:55.160
or when you see mothers just lying in a sunlit patch in the forest

02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:01.320
with babies bouncing on top of them, just having a wonderful, peaceful time.

02:17:01.320 --> 02:17:04.120
And that's what most of their lives are like.

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:11.800
So chimpanzees are the species that kind of unites the rest of the apes,

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:16.360
because a gorilla is in many ways just a big version of a chimpanzee.

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.120
If you can sort of engineer a chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger,

02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:21.640
it basically turns into a gorilla.

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:26.200
And then bonobos on the left bank of the Congo River

02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:32.600
are like a domesticated form of a chimpanzee, but obviously humans

02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:35.160
didn't domesticate them, so they're self-domesticated.

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.640
They are less aggressive, and they show all the marks of domestication

02:17:39.640 --> 02:17:43.720
that domestication animals do compared to wild animals in their bones.

02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:47.400
So they have reduced differences between males and females,

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.000
in which the males are more like females.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.040
They have smaller brains.

02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.600
They have shorter faces, smaller teeth, and smaller bodies.

02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.640
All the things that domesticated animals show.

02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:04.440
And bonobos live in this environment in a strikingly peaceful way compared to

02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:05.400
the chimpanzees.

02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:09.800
There's no indication that they will have these aggressive kills,

02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.880
and enough data now to show that there's a statistical difference

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:15.400
in the frequency in which it would happen.

02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:20.440
And bonobos are famously erotic.

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:30.200
The females have enlarged sexual parts, which swell to a particularly large size

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:32.920
compared to the female chimpanzees.

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:38.120
And the females have a lot of interactions with each other,

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:45.160
in which they excitedly rub their clitorises together and appear to have orgasms.

02:18:45.960 --> 02:18:51.640
These occur in the context of some kind of social tension.

02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:53.720
They sometimes happen before.

02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:55.640
They sometimes happen after the social tension,

02:18:55.640 --> 02:19:02.280
and they seem to be devices, these interactions, for ensuring that everyone's friends

02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:05.400
and reducing the chances that they're actually going to get into a fight.

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:10.760
So it's a kind of conflict resolution through sex,

02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:13.000
or some kind of pleasurable sexual experience.

02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:15.480
Well, it's often characterized as make love, not war.

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:15.800
That's right.

02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:17.000
Make love, not war.

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:18.600
Okay.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:25.240
You mentioned to me offline that you have a deep love for nature.

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:28.040
If we look at the world today,

02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:33.880
how can we ensure that the beautiful parts of nature

02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.840
remain a big part of our lives as human beings,

02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:45.000
in the way we think about it, in the way we also keep it around, preserve it?

02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:48.760
We keep it part of our minds and part of our world.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:19:59.000
It's a very difficult question because every time there is a conflict between

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:06.920
conservation of a natural habitat and allowing people to get that little bit of extra food

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:12.760
for their babies, then naturally the tendency is for the humans to win.

02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:21.480
So we have this steady erosion in the face of tremendous efforts to conserve nature.

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:27.800
We have a continuing steady erosion of habitats and all the species,

02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:30.520
and the numbers are always in the wrong direction.

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:35.800
Occasionally you get sort of wonderful little examples of something being saved,

02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:39.080
but the overall trend is clear.

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.920
And it's very difficult to see how one can ever escape that because it's not human.

02:20:46.520 --> 02:20:49.160
Now that we are essentially a single tribe,

02:20:50.200 --> 02:20:55.960
to want to save an elephant if it means killing 20 humans.

02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:01.480
So I think the only way in which we can really conserve

02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:13.560
is if we put tremendous effort into conserving the very best representative areas of nature.

02:21:15.320 --> 02:21:21.720
Often this will be the national parks that already exist, and what we have to do is to make them so

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:28.280
valuable that actually it is worth it in terms of human survival to be able to keep those sorts of

02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:36.440
places. That's the attitude that my colleagues and I have taken in Uganda where we want to

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:43.000
keep the Kibale National Park alive, which has got the largest population of chimpanzees in Uganda,

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.080
and it's got elephants and wonderful birds and wonderful butterflies and wonderful plants and so

02:21:47.080 --> 02:21:54.680
on, and visitors, and lots and lots of visitors. It may be that we're going to have to have

02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.920
huge increases in the amount of charges that you pay for ecotourism, and you need to make sure

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:08.840
ecotourism is done right. In other places, you will keep nature there because it's useful for

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:18.520
maintaining the climate, bringing rain. Maybe you can in some places

02:22:19.480 --> 02:22:29.720
convince people of the sheer aesthetics of keeping nature that even over the long term,

02:22:30.120 --> 02:22:38.680
presidents whose job it is to look for the future of the country will be persuaded that you can do

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:49.640
it for purely aesthetic reasons. But overall, what is required is for people in the rich countries

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:59.000
to do much more investment than they have so far in maintaining both the natural places in their

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:07.560
own countries and in the tropics. If you look at Africa, the population trends are that

02:23:08.680 --> 02:23:15.640
Nigeria may become the most populous country in the world, I think, within a century.

02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:23.400
The future of African habitats, it's clear what's going to happen in general. There's

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:34.360
going to be a huge conversion towards agricultural land. I heard Ed Wilson speak years ago about the

02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:40.920
prospect of the entire globe being turned into a single human feedlot.

02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:53.000
It's going to take a lot to avoid that. He is out there calling for half the earth to be devoted

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:59.720
to nature. It's incredibly ambitious and incredibly optimistic. But unless you have really exciting

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:08.280
goals, probably nothing will be achieved. There's something to me. When I visit New York

02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:14.360
and I see Central Park, it constructed a situation where you preserve this park in the middle,

02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:19.480
probably some of the most expensive land in the world. The fact that that's possible gives me

02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:25.400
hope that you can do this kind of preservation at a global scale, perhaps for just the aesthetic

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:34.440
reasons of just valuing the beauty and just respecting our origins of having come from the

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:41.160
earth. We are so incredibly lucky to have chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas as our

02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:46.840
close relatives still living on the earth. We're unlucky that we don't have australopithecines and

02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:51.480
other species of Homo, but we're still lucky to have those because they are incredibly closely

02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:56.200
related to us compared to what most animals have. There are many animals that don't have any close

02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:02.200
relatives to them on the earth, but not only are they relatively close, but they teach us

02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:08.280
so much about ourselves. The similarities between them and ourselves raise questions that we can

02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:15.320
then test about the extent to which our own behavioral propensities are derived from the

02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:22.520
same evolutionary stock as in those great apes. Well, how much is that worth? We could spend

02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:29.960
billions going to the Mars to find evidence of bacteria there, and that's fascinating too,

02:25:30.600 --> 02:25:36.520
but we should be spending billions on this earth in order to make sure that we have,

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:44.120
I don't know how to say it, substantial representative populations of these close

02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:50.440
relatives. Yeah, that we can meet. There's something like space tourism. When you go out

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:56.120
into space and you look back down on earth, that's to a lot of people, including myself,

02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:07.720
is worth a lot. But why is that worth a lot? It's humbling and beautiful in the same way that meeting

02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:17.080
our close evolutionary relatives is humbling and beautiful. Just to know that this is what we come

02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:22.120
from. This is who we are, not just for the understanding or the science of it, but just

02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:29.960
something about just the beauty of witnessing this. Again, it's both humbling and empowering

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:34.280
that this place is fragile and we're damn lucky to be here.

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:42.200
Yes. Unfortunately, the problems are incredibly difficult to solve and there is no one solver.

02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:49.080
It has to happen from a network of potentially cooperating people. You're so right about it

02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:53.800
being daunting to think about what it looks like from space, and I love the view that

02:26:53.880 --> 02:27:00.600
Herman Muller expressed of being able to go out from space and he said the whole of life

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:04.120
would look like a kind of rust on the planet.

02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.760
Yeah, so the aliens were to visit. I'm not sure they would notice the life. They would probably

02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:20.360
notice the trees or ocean. It's a kind of rust. But let me ask the big ridiculous philosophical

02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:25.320
question of what is the meaning of this rust? What do you think is the meaning of life on Earth?

02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:28.600
What is the meaning of our human intelligent life?

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:38.280
Well, I think it's very clear that we have an evolutionary story that is only getting

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:44.120
challenged around the edges. We have a very clear understanding of the evolution of life.

02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:58.600
And the meaning is we are here as a consequence of materialistic processes that began in our sense

02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.760
with the establishment of the Earth four and a half billion years ago, whatever it was,

02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:16.440
and then water and oxygen and so on. And we are the astonishing consequence of

02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:21.880
the evolution of cells and multicellular organisms.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:29.000
The word random is the wrong word to use unless you understand what it means.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:36.600
It didn't happen by chance, but a lot of random events had to happen to make this possible.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:42.040
And those random events, of course, are the production of appropriate mutations.

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:53.000
But the meaning of life is there is no meaning. The really big mystery of life is why is there

02:28:53.000 --> 02:29:00.520
a universe? And that same why propagates itself through the whole of it, through the whole process

02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:07.800
of it for the emergence of planets, the emergence, first of all, of galaxies, of star systems,

02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:14.600
of planets, of the proteins required to construct the single cell organisms and the single cell

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:21.160
organism becoming complex organisms and some of the clever fish crawling out onto the land

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:29.400
and the whole of it. And then there's fire, some clever guy or lady invented fire, and now here we

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:36.600
are. It just does seem, speaking as a human, kind of special that we're able to reflect on the whole

02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:41.400
thing. Or the whole- Wonderful story. It's so much more interesting than the stories produced by

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:48.680
religion. It is beautiful, but it just seems special that us humans are able to write religions and

02:29:49.560 --> 02:30:00.600
construct stories and also do science. That seems kind of amazing. It seems like the universe

02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:10.600
is such that it creates beings like us that are able to investigate it.

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:21.720
And that's why there's this longing for a why. That's such a beautiful little pocket of complexity

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:28.360
created by the universe. It seems like there should be a why, but maybe there's just an

02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:34.600
infinite number of universes and this is the one that led to this particular set of humans.

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:38.840
Even without an infinite number of universes, I bet there's an infinite number of intelligent beings.

02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.200
Throughout this universe. Yeah. Now that we know how many planets

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:49.080
have the right sort of conditions, which is what? I can't remember, a lot. It's some significant

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:59.160
percentage of all planets. Then there are apparently billions of planets. Things happen

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:08.440
so quickly on Earth. Once you got water, then you got life. It did not take long for life to evolve

02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:14.280
in the big scheme of things. If you think you look out there, say there's a nearly infinite

02:31:14.280 --> 02:31:21.000
number of intelligent civilizations, one dimension you could look at is the proclivity to violence

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:29.800
they have. It's interesting to think what level of violence is useful for extending the life of a

02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:35.640
civilization. We have a particular set of violence in our history. Maybe being too peaceful is a

02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:42.600
problem in the early days. Maybe being too violent, quite obviously, is a problem. You look at

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:48.520
viruses. What kind of viruses on Earth propagate and succeed? If you're too deadly, that's a big

02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:56.040
problem. If you're not deadly enough, that's also a problem. That is a fascinating exploration of-

02:31:56.040 --> 02:32:00.040
I don't see any evidence. I don't see where you're coming from when you say that

02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:10.680
being too peaceful is a problem. I'll say it this way. Death is a way to get rid of

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:16.120
suboptimal solutions. So violence- But there's lots of ways to die without violence.

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:24.360
Right. To me, death in itself is violence. A lot of people that talk about, for example, longevity

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:31.640
and disease and all that kind of stuff, they see death is the way they talk about it. It's

02:32:31.640 --> 02:32:37.480
interesting to philosophically think of it that way. It's like mass murder that's happening.

02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:45.640
People that try to, from a biological perspective, help extend life, they see that you're helping-

02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:52.760
The biggest atrocity in the history of human civilization, from their perspective, is

02:32:53.800 --> 02:33:02.040
not allocating all our resources to solving death. Because death is a kind of violence. It

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:09.480
is a kind of murder that we're allowing to be committed on us by nature. The flip side of that

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:17.480
is death makes way for new life, for new ideas. Yes, but that's got nothing to do with peace

02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:23.880
versus war. You have animals that are very, very peaceful, but they evolve just in the same way as

02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:30.440
other animals do. They just don't do it with death caused by violence. Violent death is premature

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:39.400
death, surely. I don't mind about people dying. What I mind about is people dying in their youth.

02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:45.320
In middle age. prematurely. But some people would say all death is premature. It certainly

02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:52.840
feels that way. It's died too soon. Anyone who's ever died, died too soon. Yeah. Well, I mean,

02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:58.360
if we can become like sequoias and live for hundreds of years and thousands of years,

02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:03.320
that would be great. Do you ponder your own mortality? Are you afraid of death?

02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:08.280
I don't think I'm afraid of it. I'm reconciled to the fact it's going to happen.

02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:16.680
I just feel frustrated because I enjoy life, you know, and I don't want to, to leave the party.

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:26.760
Yeah, it's kind of a fun party. I don't want to leave the party either. So however we got here,

02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:32.600
we made one heck of an awesome party. And you're right. Having a party with a little bit less

02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:38.360
violence than it is an even more fun party. Richard, I'm deeply honored that you spent time

02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.960
with me today. Your work is amazing. It's includes some of the deepest thinking about

02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:49.720
our human history and the nature of human civilization. So again, thank you so much

02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:53.480
for talking today. It's an honor. No, thanks for your great questions. It's a very fun conversation.

02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:59.400
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wrangham. To support this podcast,

02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:11.560
Goodall. The greatest danger to our future is apathy. Thank you for listening and hope to see

02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.160
you next time.
