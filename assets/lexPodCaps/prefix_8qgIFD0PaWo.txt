If you really want to give a character an obstacle to overcome, a need.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.140
I mean, the base one is life and death.

00:10.020 --> 00:13.080
The following is a conversation with Matthew McConaughey,

00:13.460 --> 00:16.820
a legendary Oscar winning actor and one of the most unique,

00:16.860 --> 00:21.600
charismatic and inspiring humans and Texans who walk this earth.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.540
He starred in films and shows loved by me and millions of others,

00:26.780 --> 00:30.540
including Interstellar, Dazed and Confused, Dallas Bias Club,

00:30.580 --> 00:35.660
Killer Joe, Mud, True Detective, and soon a spin-off of Yellowstone.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.520
Offscreen, his words carry wisdom and power in his book called Green Lights

00:41.800 --> 00:44.560
and his new video course called Road Trip,

00:44.960 --> 00:49.160
where Matthew expands on the philosophy in his book and shows how to apply

00:49.160 --> 00:53.840
to your life in order to find more happiness, success and love.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.680
This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:00.020 --> 01:03.980
And now, dear friends, here's Matthew McConaughey.

01:05.160 --> 01:07.020
Let's start with love.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.660
Your parents had a complicated love story.

01:09.660 --> 01:12.460
Divorced twice, married three times.

01:12.460 --> 01:16.000
What did you learn about love from your mom and dad and their love story?

01:16.000 --> 01:29.240
That it's messy, that it takes work, that it's ugly,

01:31.320 --> 01:38.660
that no matter how ugly or messy it is, don't go to bed

01:38.660 --> 01:47.100
until you've come back together to either embrace or admit

01:47.100 --> 01:49.840
that you truly love each other, even if you hadn't solved

01:49.840 --> 01:52.800
what the hell you're bitching about.

01:52.800 --> 02:03.980
That love will win in the end, literally three to two with my mom and dad.

02:03.980 --> 02:13.180
And that even in the two divorces and in the two times where they couldn't live

02:13.180 --> 02:16.080
with each other, they still loved each other.

02:16.660 --> 02:22.900
They just couldn't live with each other at that time for whatever reason they needed.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.960
And I don't know the details, but they needed their space, freedom or what,

02:27.960 --> 02:31.500
but they were never out of love with each other.

02:34.940 --> 02:46.020
And that as a parent, if you just, when we're not sure what to do

02:48.020 --> 02:53.900
and people give you a thousand books and advice, as a parent,

02:53.900 --> 03:00.260
if your kid knows you love them, you're in the black.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.760
That's the main thing.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.300
It won't work without that.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.780
And it can work and will usually can work with that.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.580
They just know that fact.

03:10.980 --> 03:12.380
So it's not just love for each other.

03:12.380 --> 03:17.220
It's the love for the bigger family that ultimately helps you

03:17.220 --> 03:19.220
persist through the ups and downs.

03:20.060 --> 03:27.260
Well, I mean, I don't know how much, particularly my mom and dad were

03:29.960 --> 03:33.640
staying together at times, maybe when they didn't want to, because they

03:33.640 --> 03:35.960
had children, I don't actually think they considered that.

03:37.000 --> 03:44.780
I think they were much less conscientious than say, I am today.

03:44.780 --> 03:48.040
I think my mom and dad were more like, they'll be fine.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.540
We love them.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.880
They'll be fine, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.560
Right now they were, let's work it out between you and I, is what I think

03:56.560 --> 03:59.160
my mom and dad were saying to each other, or, or not.

03:59.680 --> 04:12.080
They wanted a needed relationship that was a tidal wave, rocky, right angles,

04:12.520 --> 04:19.680
tsunamis, and to this day in my life with Camillia and I, which I don't,

04:19.680 --> 04:24.360
I like a river has some swerves and some streams and some rapids, but

04:24.360 --> 04:26.160
I'm not looking for tidal wave.

04:26.160 --> 04:32.640
My mom's like, what's all this, everything's so smooth, stuff, come on,

04:32.640 --> 04:37.480
come on, come on, come on, and so she challenges like vitality.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.160
Cause that's what my mom needed to communicate.

04:40.160 --> 04:47.640
I don't think my dad needed it as much that the, the, the, the, the, the hard

04:47.640 --> 04:52.480
angles that their relationship, I don't think my dad needed as much as my mom.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.160
But the clashes demonstrated the passion that underlies the love.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.080
Yes.

04:58.240 --> 05:02.000
And that's, I've, I've, I've always been asked, you know, when I talk about

05:02.000 --> 05:06.680
my parents love relationship, I tell the stories that are actually

05:06.760 --> 05:10.800
sometimes quite violent and there's some good stories there.

05:10.840 --> 05:11.800
They're beautiful.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.760
I think they're beautiful.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.240
Yeah.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.360
I think they're beautiful too.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.000
But I've had people go, wait a minute, that was unhealthy.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.720
You can't, and I was like, no, that's again, back to the beginning.

05:20.720 --> 05:21.480
Love's messy.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.680
And that, what I love about those stories is that's where the love was.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.400
Actually it was tested and it could have broke and been over.

05:30.880 --> 05:31.120
Yeah.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.920
And it never was again.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.680
The love one in the kitchen floor, the blood's drawn.

05:38.320 --> 05:45.080
Knives are pulled, ketchup, ketchup's all over, but we make love on

05:45.080 --> 05:47.000
the kitchen floor to end, I mean, come on.

05:47.040 --> 05:47.600
Beautiful.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.800
So as romantic as it gets right there.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.080
Whoa.

05:51.680 --> 05:56.760
Uh, what's the memory from childhood that helped set you on the trajectory

05:57.080 --> 05:58.560
of becoming the man you are today?

06:03.360 --> 06:05.840
Standing on the corner with Mr.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.560
Mayor, the principal of St.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.520
Philip's school.

06:09.640 --> 06:15.400
I was in kindergarten and they looked up and there was a cloud in the sky.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.600
And I said, Mr.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.080
Mayor, is that cloud as big as the world?

06:21.200 --> 06:26.240
And he paused for a minute and he goes, well, yes, it is Matthew.

06:28.080 --> 06:33.880
Now in my seven year old mind, I went, okay, I can see the outlines of it.

06:36.240 --> 06:42.800
And that must mean it is so far away because if that's as big as the world,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.120
that's as big as the world.

06:44.320 --> 06:48.440
I remember it took 15 hours just to drive from, from long view to Florida

06:49.120 --> 06:52.160
last year, you know, and I can't even see that far.

06:52.160 --> 06:57.280
So that cloud must be so far off that it's not worth me even considering

06:59.480 --> 07:03.040
space, dreams, any of that.

07:03.040 --> 07:06.480
I was like, army, I'm looking down.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.680
I'm going to put my head to the ground.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.920
I'm going to look right in front of me and deal with what's in front of me

07:09.920 --> 07:15.680
because dealing with dreams and what's out there and not on this earth that

07:15.680 --> 07:17.680
gravity holds down, not worth considering.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.240
You never make it.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.200
It's not even worth imagining.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.760
It's poof, it's fairy dust.

07:23.720 --> 07:29.960
So I think I got learned a lot of self-reliance from that.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.440
I think I got a work ethic from that.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.680
I think I got a, Hey, focus on what's right in front of you.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.240
Do the deed.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.840
Take care of what's in front of you one at a time and slowly notch up your way.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.680
And hopefully there's some ascension to that.

07:46.520 --> 07:56.200
And it wasn't until 40 years later, in some ways decades later, that I started to go.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.440
Oh, I can project.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.240
I can dream.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.120
Why?

08:03.360 --> 08:08.080
Because literally the first time I got on a plane and then 30 seconds, I was in a cloud.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.640
I'm like, Whoa, we must be going a trillion miles an hour because we're already in that

08:11.640 --> 08:12.000
cloud.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That was as big as the world that I saw the edge of.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.000
And then I grew and learned enough to go, well, that's not true.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.880
Trains, planes don't go that fast.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.040
Oh, what Mr.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.440
Mayor said wasn't really true.

08:24.440 --> 08:28.920
That cloud is not as big as the world and it's not near as far away as I thought.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.200
But I'm glad he lied to me.

08:31.760 --> 08:32.760
What do you think about that?

08:32.760 --> 08:38.600
That tension of a way of living life between being a dreamer and a pragmatist?

08:38.600 --> 08:39.040
Yeah.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.840
Which is a better way?

08:43.280 --> 08:47.080
Donnie holds the, the reciprocity of the two of them.

08:47.280 --> 08:51.840
I mean, I can't be present unless I got plans.

08:52.800 --> 08:57.240
I want to, I want to have the big picture in mind, but I got to be present.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.280
I want to have the big picture in mind, but I got to go a day at a time.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.000
I like to write the headline or have a, I think we need to have a North star.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.640
Something to look forward to.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.200
But we all know that if we're staring at it, we're tripping on the way.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.800
If we're just, you know, the old, you read the hallmark card to take,

09:19.400 --> 09:20.720
irk me, you know, dream it.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.440
You can do it.

09:21.960 --> 09:26.120
I think that's a half-ass horrible thing to tell somebody.

09:26.120 --> 09:26.760
Yeah.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.480
You know, cause, um, and you talk, and then on the other side, you have things

09:31.480 --> 09:34.560
like, you know, people say, hope means nothing.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.360
Well, yes, it does.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.960
That's the dream.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.240
You just don't stop there.

09:39.360 --> 09:40.880
It's not a period after that word.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.400
Now, what do we do practically?

09:44.680 --> 09:48.560
And I think that constant tension, when that tension to dance is when it's

09:48.600 --> 09:51.880
beautiful, there's not as much, but to see those as contradictions, I think is

09:51.880 --> 09:53.480
where we've fallen short.

09:53.480 --> 10:00.640
So I don't, I want on their own, if we silo the two, if you silo the two, I guess

10:00.640 --> 10:04.280
that the pragmatics, the one to go with, because at least you'll get something

10:04.280 --> 10:07.160
done, but if you only silo the dream and don't do anything about it, that's,

10:07.160 --> 10:11.720
you're kind of living an illusion and kind of living in a virtual reality.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.200
Yeah, it's tricky.

10:13.240 --> 10:17.120
Even though it's not as beautiful, it's not as beautiful, it's not as beautiful.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.160
Yeah, it's tricky.

10:18.280 --> 10:24.560
Even the people you love can sometimes suffocate the dream can make you

10:24.560 --> 10:26.040
believe that it's not possible.

10:26.760 --> 10:32.440
It feels like a lot of parents kind of want you to be safe, want you to be

10:32.440 --> 10:36.720
stable, want you to have a plan so that everything's going to be okay.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.400
And the dream feels like a threat to that.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.240
Yeah.

10:43.240 --> 10:47.240
How much of that though, I wonder is, is proper initiation?

10:49.240 --> 10:53.280
Because if you throw in dreams out, I call it conservative, very liberal late.

10:53.680 --> 10:55.120
Let's learn to block and tackle.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.320
Let's learn to that work ethic, those things, those pragmatics first.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.520
Learn the rules of the road, the rules of the game, the things that we can all

11:04.520 --> 11:08.120
kind of rely on, this is how the world's supposed to work.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.640
Now it doesn't always work that way.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.320
You know, you teach a child to drive.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.800
It's like, yeah, you stay in the lane, you go to speed limit.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.120
That's not helpful, but that doesn't guarantee that no one else is

11:17.120 --> 11:19.760
running the red light, but we learn that later.

11:23.600 --> 11:32.000
There's an initiation, I think that's proper with the dream.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.920
I mean, I think parents, my parents very much that way.

11:38.480 --> 11:43.280
The idea of going to chase an acting career or something was what?

11:44.600 --> 11:46.920
It was, it was, that was a different vernacular.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.640
That was like not in our, I was taught to work away up a company ladder

11:51.640 --> 11:54.720
and nine to five, do your job.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.040
But the day I brought it up and said, I want to go to film school.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.800
And I thought my dad was going to go, you want to do what boy?

12:03.680 --> 12:07.680
He was like, gave me some of the best advice ever and told me not to

12:07.680 --> 12:13.200
half ass it and said, go in between the lines.

12:14.480 --> 12:19.600
What he heard from me was that made him so happy as a father, I believe.

12:19.880 --> 12:23.760
It makes any parent happy is when our child doesn't ask us

12:23.760 --> 12:25.480
permission to go chase a dream.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.120
Oh yeah.

12:26.240 --> 12:31.600
When they're going, I'm bringing it up to you with full respect, but

12:31.600 --> 12:32.960
I'm doing this with or without you.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.560
That's when a parent goes, oh, yes.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.000
I've done something right enough.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.480
I made, I helped my child be secure enough in the pragmatics to have a

12:44.480 --> 12:49.480
foundation enough where they have the courage to go, I'm flying the nest.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.680
To take the leap.

12:52.480 --> 12:57.480
You wrote after my dad died, I had a dream that left me with a statement,

12:57.640 --> 12:59.640
less impressed, more involved.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.360
What are those words mean to you?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.800
We got to be more than just happy to be here.

13:08.680 --> 13:12.360
I'm big on gratitude, but we've got to be more than just thankful to be here.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.640
Dream it.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.120
You can do it.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.320
It's got to be more than just dream it.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.040
You can do it.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.120
That's impressed.

13:19.200 --> 13:33.960
The dream is still other than if I'm here and so impressed talking to you

13:34.840 --> 13:43.920
today, if I have a reverence to an extent, I will not be able to be

13:43.920 --> 13:45.360
involved in this conversation.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.680
I'll be too impressed.

13:47.680 --> 13:48.880
I'll be anticipating.

13:49.720 --> 13:50.560
Oh, what's that question?

13:50.560 --> 13:52.200
He's going to, he's going to, he's going to ask.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.240
Oh, I think I know he's going this.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.040
Oh, I think I know what answer he might love to hear.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.120
Oh, I, I'm not involved in conversation.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.200
I'm too impressed.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.440
So I'm removed from the present.

14:04.240 --> 14:12.840
Um, for me, what that literally meant to me when that came to me in a dream and

14:12.840 --> 14:14.680
I carved it in, I remember carved it in a tree.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.960
It took a couple of hours.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.000
I still wonder, I still know where that tree is, Santa Monica.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.920
It was, uh, my father had moved on.

14:23.960 --> 14:24.960
He'd left this life.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.080
All of a sudden it hit me.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.680
Oh, I don't have the safety net.

14:30.040 --> 14:33.280
My dad was above law and above religion to me.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.760
He had me, if I really, if I really was in the shit, if I really needed him,

14:37.760 --> 14:41.520
I trusted that he had my back above law, above anything.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.360
All of a sudden he's gone.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.440
I go in, okay.

14:47.600 --> 14:51.480
It hit me how much I've been pretending to be the young man.

14:52.960 --> 14:57.680
I was trying to be and not actually put my ass on the line and having enough

14:57.680 --> 15:01.640
courage to take risk and actually own up to the man that he was trying to, that

15:01.640 --> 15:03.240
he was teaching me to be.

15:04.120 --> 15:07.440
And I remember the world got flat.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.200
That cloud that Mr.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.480
Mayor that I saw there was not way up there.

15:14.480 --> 15:20.360
It was, it was fog in front of me now and let's go into it.

15:21.040 --> 15:28.080
It was, I kept, I'd say I probably gained even more respect for people and things,

15:29.080 --> 15:34.160
but I lost a certain amount of reverence that was keeping me from feeling like I

15:34.360 --> 15:41.160
deserved or earned things or, or looking out for myself or holding myself to task.

15:42.040 --> 15:47.720
Um, and I remember all the things that I, and I was just getting, going to

15:47.720 --> 15:52.480
Hollywood at the time, so I was getting, fame was out there as one of those clouds.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.320
You know, with being an actor and all of a sudden celebrity and becoming famous,

15:58.320 --> 16:06.560
the reverence I had, I remember it just, it lowered down to eye level and I was

16:06.560 --> 16:10.800
able to realize it and go, that's not a, that's not fairy dust and don't give it

16:10.800 --> 16:12.800
so much credit to make it fairy dust.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.960
Like, Oh, not me.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.200
No, I can never, no, look that in the eye with full respect, but less reverence.

16:20.600 --> 16:26.480
And at the same time, equidistant, almost equal sublimation, I noticed where I

16:26.480 --> 16:34.320
had been condescending people and things and patronizing and, and sloughing things

16:34.320 --> 16:40.880
off as like less than me and not worthy of my time, it raised up to eye level.

16:41.040 --> 16:44.600
And so they were all flat in front of me and the world was flat.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.760
And I was able to, shoulders went back.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.120
My heart rose up, my chin lifted up.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
I looked at the world, looked things in the eye.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.720
I became probably less sentimental.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.360
Hopefully not to a level that I got callous, but I know became less sentimental.

17:00.360 --> 17:07.440
I became more courageous because, you know, when you have someone pass in your life,

17:11.040 --> 17:15.200
or maybe it's similar to a situation you're going on in your own life, your homeland,

17:15.240 --> 17:22.240
you, you, you sober up on these mendacities that we deal with every day.

17:22.680 --> 17:28.440
And this, this, this bullshit that we, that we, that we, we, oh, we give too much

17:28.440 --> 17:30.080
credit or too much significance to.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.520
And you're like, what am I, what am I doing?

17:32.400 --> 17:38.280
Why am I, I'm not even gonna let myself emotionally get brought down or overrelated

17:38.280 --> 17:44.440
by this situation because I'm, this is, it doesn't really matter in the big scheme.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.920
And so we, we, we, certain things that I found reverence for and, and

17:49.960 --> 17:56.400
hesitated from in my life, I was now engaging with because I was like, oh, it's live.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.080
This life is live.

17:58.080 --> 18:03.120
Let's look at the eye and go forward through it and deal with the consequences.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.920
What do you make of death?

18:06.160 --> 18:06.840
Does it scare you?

18:09.680 --> 18:12.320
I'm not looking forward to it, but it does not scare me.

18:13.200 --> 18:13.920
Do you think about it?

18:15.000 --> 18:15.960
Do you visualize it?

18:16.840 --> 18:17.240
I do.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.200
I do.

18:18.440 --> 18:24.240
And it's a beautiful visualization and a beautiful dream when I go as part of the

18:24.240 --> 18:30.840
food chain, it's not a good visualization when I go as part of a random act of

18:30.840 --> 18:38.880
violence and a fricking drive-by or something, because the second, the accident,

18:38.920 --> 18:47.920
the accident, it breaks a story that I believe has already been written.

18:49.400 --> 18:55.480
At least I don't have the capacity yet to, to, to put it into a, a story, a divine

18:55.480 --> 18:58.840
story of the lives that we, we live.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.840
And so there's something ugly and gross about it.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.920
And it happens all the, all the time, eh, you know, to, to, to people all the time.

19:07.920 --> 19:12.640
I just feel like when it's part of the food chain, when I go as part of the

19:12.640 --> 19:14.600
food chain, I'm like, ah, that's poetry.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.360
Part of the flow of nature.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.800
You returned to nature.

19:18.640 --> 19:18.960
Yeah.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.160
There's grace and poetry in that.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.440
Do you miss your father?

19:28.720 --> 19:29.480
Think about him.

19:30.320 --> 19:30.920
Think about him.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.760
When I think about him, I do.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.640
Now, when do I think about him?

19:43.040 --> 19:46.640
I thought about him yesterday, working through a script I'm working on right

19:46.640 --> 19:48.120
now, working on scene work.

19:49.200 --> 19:55.320
And I just had that quick little reaction of wanting to show him,

19:55.320 --> 19:58.520
I check the scene, that's right.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.400
And then I, I don't get sad.

20:01.400 --> 20:06.400
I go, yeah, he would have loved, he would have loved this.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.840
Whereas my mom wants to be on the stage.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.280
My dad would have been on the front row.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.520
He's more fun to show stuff too.

20:17.760 --> 20:18.360
Yeah.

20:18.360 --> 20:22.840
And he would have, you know, as, as what he would, we would have, he knew, he

20:22.840 --> 20:24.600
was a character, he knew characters.

20:24.600 --> 20:29.480
I've based parts of all kinds of characters I've played in the, in the

20:29.480 --> 20:34.520
man that, that I am on people that he introduced me to and who he was.

20:34.920 --> 20:39.560
Um, he would have loved the creative process of working on a script or, or

20:39.720 --> 20:41.280
talking about, Hey, movie.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.400
It's why I always say I love the movie mud.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.240
Because it's the one that I, I've visualized and seen my dad come to me so

20:48.240 --> 20:52.280
many times as a 12 year old and put his arm around me and go, Hey, little buddy,

20:52.640 --> 20:54.000
you seen this movie called mud?

20:54.520 --> 20:54.840
Damn.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.480
It's a good one.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.480
Let's go watch it.

20:57.480 --> 21:03.480
That now my dad was never got to see me start a career in film, but he was alive

21:03.480 --> 21:09.360
five days into the over, he overlapped the first five days of me working on my

21:09.360 --> 21:10.640
first film days confused.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.480
Now that I think there's something beautiful about that.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.880
He didn't never ever come to the set.

21:16.480 --> 21:19.240
We didn't talk about it, but he was alive.

21:20.240 --> 21:26.080
For me to start something that was more than, um, uh, more than a fad.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.160
That was something that would become something that I love to do.

21:29.680 --> 21:35.280
And I do miss, not him, you know, and then I go out of that.

21:35.280 --> 21:42.360
Do I, I, I, we talked about him two nights ago with our, with our daughter.

21:42.360 --> 21:47.760
I was, I was rubbing my daughter's feet and my mom is living with this.

21:48.280 --> 21:50.120
91 comes in and goes, Oh, look at you.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.240
Just like your pop.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.000
He's like, what?

21:53.000 --> 21:54.640
And he goes, Oh, cause my dad loved her.

21:55.800 --> 22:01.080
Rubbed somebody's feet, rubbed my mom's feet, rubbed all of me and

22:01.080 --> 22:02.240
my brother's girlfriend's feet.

22:03.720 --> 22:10.960
When we would have a date, they would come over early because they knew they

22:10.960 --> 22:15.120
were going to get a foot rub from Jim McConaughey and then we'd come out.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.880
Me and my two older brothers on, this has been on for decades.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.640
We come out and shout ready to go buttoned up and they looked at me like,

22:20.920 --> 22:22.160
we ain't going anywhere right now.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.880
And so we told the story, you know, to my, to my daughter and I was like,

22:26.880 --> 22:28.920
Oh yeah, my dad's, it's his hands.

22:28.920 --> 22:29.800
I miss his hands.

22:30.320 --> 22:31.520
His hands could heal.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.320
So you carry him in you.

22:33.960 --> 22:34.640
I hope so.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.640
I, I hope so.

22:38.640 --> 22:51.360
And it's a, a challenge for me.

22:51.360 --> 22:55.280
And I suppose it's like this for any son.

22:57.760 --> 23:06.080
How much do we hang on to and how much do we let go and evolve and update

23:06.080 --> 23:14.000
the OS and try maybe better or different, you know, it's that there's

23:14.000 --> 23:17.600
certain things that I know that I fully believe in.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.280
It's like, when do we religious, when do we cast away our father?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.720
You know, when do we say, no, I'm going after the dream.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.360
I'm not asking your permission.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.840
I, I, I, I, I question that.

23:36.320 --> 23:40.200
From time to time for myself, because I, and it almost feels blasphemic.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.680
If that's a word, sometimes I feel like you can't, what are you doing?

23:43.720 --> 23:47.440
You can't check that and go like, well, no, I'm not sure if I want to really.

23:48.640 --> 23:52.640
And then I immediately kind of let myself off because I believe where he is, he's

23:52.640 --> 23:57.200
going, go, but you're free, man.

23:57.240 --> 23:57.600
Yeah.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.680
You know, I'm not, I'm not going to hold you back if you misread that, or I

24:01.680 --> 24:05.360
didn't teach you that as well as maybe I wish I could have go, you're free.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.000
You're not going to lose trust that you're not going to lose.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.360
It's in your DNA.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.080
It's in your lineage, young man.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.360
Still, it's scary to not have a safety net.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.520
Losing your father is scary in that way.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.640
You realize this world is just you and some deep fundamental way.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.360
It's just you.

24:25.320 --> 24:25.640
Yeah.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.680
You're alone.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.120
Yes.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.400
But, ah, I mean, also not having that.

24:36.080 --> 24:47.800
It's such a gift of deliverance though, as well, because it's, I think it's an,

24:47.800 --> 24:55.800
I mean, it's an awesome feeling to know, to know we're alone, to know we don't

24:55.800 --> 25:03.040
have that, to know you don't have take two or take three, that it's one take.

25:03.240 --> 25:10.320
I mean, the peripheral vision improves, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the,

25:12.440 --> 25:15.200
the link and understanding with our past improves.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.600
Cause I know for me, I was not ever considered of my past at all.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.480
Cause that my dad had that if I needed it, he was my well for that.

25:23.760 --> 25:29.160
Well, he's gone, you know, except he had the literally had, they have our back.

25:29.680 --> 25:32.040
Well, and then when they no longer have our back, all of a sudden I'm going,

25:32.400 --> 25:37.640
Oh, maybe I need to look back and start giving some credit to how I got here.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.160
What I'm doing and where I'm heading.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.760
It gave me the first time courage to even look over my shoulder.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.160
Cause again, I didn't have to, cause I don't have to look dad's got my back.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.440
No, dad's gone from this life.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.680
He doesn't have your back.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.400
Okay.

26:00.400 --> 26:06.520
So, I mean, I don't know me because it's inevitable.

26:06.520 --> 26:20.640
I, I very quickly go to, all right, in the, in the pain, the loss and yes, even

26:20.640 --> 26:24.680
loneliness, which is different from being alone and loss.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.760
Pretty immediately part and parcel with the pain.

26:26.760 --> 26:28.720
I felt it in the pain.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.440
You saw the gift, the red light of losing your, losing your father

26:33.440 --> 26:35.640
pretty immediately, less impressed, more involved.

26:35.680 --> 26:41.960
I came like a couple of weeks after moving on.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.040
Is there a trick to that to see the gift in the pain?

26:46.640 --> 26:47.640
That's a good question.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.200
Is there a trick to it?

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Not that I know of.

26:51.680 --> 26:59.760
I have to, I have to catch myself from trying to intellectualize my way into the

26:59.760 --> 27:08.200
reasoning and not skip over real feelings and discomfort.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.880
I mean, I, I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.400
That, that so resilient that we just dust ourselves off.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.560
I mean, I, I did get that from my mom and I have to watch it.

27:18.600 --> 27:22.480
That so resilient that we just dust ourselves off and get up and go.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.160
You want to sit in the feeling, you want to feel it.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.720
You really deeply feel the pain.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.400
I want to, I want to deeply feel it.

27:28.440 --> 27:32.240
I want to look at the end, deeply feel it, but I don't want to wallow in it.

27:32.480 --> 27:32.800
Yeah.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.520
Um, now I was raised where you skip the deeply feel and let's go.

27:40.760 --> 27:46.720
And I've said it before, but that will lead to having turned into a

27:46.720 --> 27:48.280
person who is a repeat offender.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.160
The same crimes.

27:50.160 --> 27:55.080
Cause you, you just get up and you don't, you don't have a winter in your life.

27:55.080 --> 27:55.560
You know what I mean?

27:55.560 --> 27:57.720
You don't have, you, you, there's no introspective time.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.040
You don't look over your shoulder in the end of the past.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.320
And so you just get up and you're like, all right, I've, I've, I've stepped in

28:04.320 --> 28:07.640
the same pile of whatever a hundred times and I'm fine.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.040
I'll do it a hundred and first doesn't hurt.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.080
Hell it's good luck.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.760
Well, hang on a minute.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.120
Maybe we want to stop and go, what can I learn from that?

28:15.000 --> 28:19.440
But it, it, it, I don't know of a trick.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.720
I think, I think that, I think that, I think our feet, there's any trick.

28:24.720 --> 28:31.080
I would say it's just, it, how quickly can we admit the inevitable?

28:32.200 --> 28:32.960
That's what I talk about in the book.

28:32.960 --> 28:36.880
I get once you, once you know it's inevitable, how do we get relative?

28:37.600 --> 28:42.560
Not skip it, not throw it to the side, not deny it, which I'd love to talk about that.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.160
Here's sometimes too, but the value of denial sometimes.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.520
The value of denial.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.000
Yeah.

28:47.960 --> 28:56.480
But how quickly do we, do we want something's inevitable go, okay, any mind

28:56.480 --> 29:00.680
and heart time I'm spending about going, no, I can't believe that happened.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.720
No, or did that really happen?

29:03.280 --> 29:07.040
Anytime we spend trying to deny that what has already happened, that seems to me to

29:07.040 --> 29:08.840
be, I'm not sure the value of that time.

29:08.880 --> 29:12.680
So if any, if there's any trick, I would say, once you know something's inevitable,

29:12.680 --> 29:18.880
even though how painful it is or how awesome it is, start getting relative with that.

29:18.880 --> 29:23.800
And in the relativity is seeing there's a gift here.

29:23.800 --> 29:31.560
And if I realize that gift, I'm honoring, now I'm on to building up the beautiful

29:31.560 --> 29:34.120
passage of my father leaving this life.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.400
Now I'm on the market.

29:36.440 --> 29:40.760
Yes, let's let the legacy, let this become omnipresent, let him live through me.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.800
Let me become more him that it's transformed.

29:43.800 --> 29:44.120
Yeah.

29:44.600 --> 29:53.480
So what value is there then to, uh, denial any, oh, I think divided if you really commit

29:53.480 --> 29:59.160
to it, I get this from my mother.

29:59.160 --> 30:03.040
So it's a very pragmatic way to go about it.

30:03.040 --> 30:03.480
My mother.

30:03.520 --> 30:03.840
Yeah.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.720
So it's a very pragmatic, uh, value to the denial.

30:09.040 --> 30:09.440
Okay.

30:10.480 --> 30:16.720
And, and, and, and, and, and, and my mom does it to an extent that, that, that I'm

30:16.720 --> 30:22.640
like, mom, do you have any consideration or context of situations?

30:22.880 --> 30:24.920
And she does, this is the thing.

30:24.920 --> 30:31.560
Every time I go, she's not a shallow woman, but if it is not, if it is something, if it

30:31.560 --> 30:42.840
is something happens in her life, that is keeping her from going where she wants to

30:42.840 --> 30:48.800
go or having a joy in her life that she does.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.080
She'll straight ass deny it happened.

30:52.360 --> 30:52.920
Didn't happen.

30:54.480 --> 30:54.880
No, it did.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.080
Mom, we're right here.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.600
I heard you what you said.

31:01.320 --> 31:01.800
No, I didn't.

31:01.800 --> 31:02.520
You heard something else.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.200
Mom.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.520
Now she gets some amnesty on that.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.240
She's 91.

31:08.240 --> 31:08.680
Hell yes.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.240
She gets some amnesty on that.

31:10.600 --> 31:16.840
Um, but I've, she's not, yeah, does she repeat offend?

31:16.840 --> 31:18.560
Yeah, but it's, it's misdemeanors.

31:20.000 --> 31:20.600
You know what I mean?

31:20.600 --> 31:22.920
I mean, it's like, we all, it's part of that thing when you got a family member,

31:22.920 --> 31:24.280
you're like, yep, that's just what they do.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.080
Just go with it.

31:25.520 --> 31:30.000
You know, and, and, and it's, and it's, it's ingenious in a way.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.880
It's a tool.

31:31.440 --> 31:31.960
She does.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.360
I think it is more of a trick with her, but she wouldn't even so ingrained

31:34.360 --> 31:35.240
her, it's not a trick.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.880
It just do it done.

31:38.560 --> 31:43.800
And I, and I, and I, another reason I bring this up, it's outside of just my mother is

31:43.800 --> 31:55.680
I did this, um, uh, road trip course in this art of living event a few weeks ago,

31:58.840 --> 32:04.840
out of the hundreds of thousands of chats that came in and responses that came in

32:04.840 --> 32:12.440
afterward, it seemed to me that about 80% of people's challenges and problems, even

32:12.440 --> 32:20.280
in their life were something in the past that they were hung up on, that they could

32:20.280 --> 32:21.600
not seem to get past.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.840
And it was, it was holding them from going where they wanted to in their future.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.440
And so I thought that was revealing.

32:28.440 --> 32:31.760
I would have thought, I would have thought that was, I don't know, going in 40%.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.200
It was 80, it seemed to be 80%.

32:33.240 --> 32:33.600
Yeah.

32:34.680 --> 32:42.800
And then I thought about, okay, if you're here in the live show and you want to get

32:42.800 --> 32:48.160
the course, you're into some sort of therapy or education or development or

32:48.160 --> 32:48.960
self-help or whatever.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.480
Okay.

32:53.120 --> 32:58.960
And I have a lot of friends and I know a lot of people that earn weekly and daily

32:59.880 --> 33:00.400
therapy.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.640
And then I know there's a lot of people that are on prescriptions, drugs.

33:07.480 --> 33:11.600
And while the therapy and the right prescription to the right person for the

33:11.600 --> 33:21.200
right diagnosis is necessary, I'm questioning, is there a value to going, if

33:21.200 --> 33:25.320
you're not getting past this today, this week, this month, this year, all of a

33:25.640 --> 33:30.480
decade goes by and you're still hung up and you can't get rid of that thing and

33:30.480 --> 33:35.480
your memory where it was, and you've, it's, it's got you paralyzed and you're,

33:35.520 --> 33:37.080
you're, you're a victim of it.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.880
Is there, and you're doing the therapy and you're doing the work and you're taking

33:40.880 --> 33:44.120
a prescription, if that's what you're taking, where does it, is there a value

33:44.120 --> 33:47.560
in going, if it's holding you back from going where you want to go, maybe it's

33:47.560 --> 33:52.040
just deny the fucking thing ever fucking happened, kick it in the head, kick it

33:52.040 --> 33:54.680
off the curb, I'm done with you.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.200
I'm sick of you.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.240
I'm tired of hanging out with you.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.360
I'm tired of that thing.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.520
Whatever it is, hold me back from going where I want to go.

34:01.520 --> 34:07.800
So if I, if I can't wax the car, you know, and, and, and, and get past

34:07.800 --> 34:10.360
this thing, just kick it.

34:11.000 --> 34:11.800
That's so powerful.

34:11.800 --> 34:17.120
So one thing to do, like with the loss of your father is to try to transform

34:17.120 --> 34:22.480
it, to discover the gift in it, the gift in the pain, but if you can't keep

34:22.520 --> 34:26.800
looking and keep looking, you can't find the gift in the pain to deny it ever happened.

34:27.600 --> 34:32.440
You could call that a trick, but I think it's more than a trick because let me say

34:32.440 --> 34:40.040
this, my mom, after my father died, went on and found a second love of her life.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.760
For seven, 19 years, they were together.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.360
CJ Karlich.

34:48.320 --> 34:48.960
Love you buddy.

34:49.320 --> 34:50.200
He's moved on now.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.440
Did she check with us a little bit?

34:56.160 --> 34:57.840
Like, is this okay?

34:59.200 --> 35:02.160
She gave us a little lingering half a second look that we knew that maybe

35:02.160 --> 35:03.040
is what she was asking.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.200
And we came to her was like, yes, it's okay.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.720
And you know who else is saying it's okay?

35:07.760 --> 35:10.560
Who's dancing up there for you, dad.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.960
So was that her denying?

35:17.000 --> 35:21.880
Had the man she was divorced from twice and married to three times and had three

35:21.880 --> 35:24.720
children with, had moved on?

35:25.480 --> 35:26.080
No.

35:27.360 --> 35:33.320
But she didn't say, I'm not, you know, well, what's the book on how long I'm

35:33.320 --> 35:36.400
supposed to say single before I can be interested in another, you know, there's

35:36.400 --> 35:38.000
not a book on these things.

35:39.080 --> 35:40.040
How do you feel?

35:40.360 --> 35:44.320
Is loving CJ mean you love dad less?

35:44.320 --> 35:44.840
No.

35:47.040 --> 35:52.840
Is finding a new life and a new dance partner in this life and CJ mean that

35:53.400 --> 35:55.960
dad wasn't your dance partner?

35:57.440 --> 35:59.120
The dad wasn't the love of your life?

36:02.920 --> 36:03.440
No.

36:07.440 --> 36:08.240
So I don't know.

36:08.240 --> 36:12.240
I mean, in there, maybe, you know, maybe there's another way to put it.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.320
In there, maybe, you know, maybe there's another way.

36:14.320 --> 36:16.560
I think it's denial, but it's not really denial.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.440
Cause it's not like it didn't happen.

36:18.440 --> 36:21.080
That's an earlier example I was giving my mom.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.480
She will absolutely go, that light's not on.

36:24.480 --> 36:25.360
Mom, the light's on.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.560
We just, that light's not on.

36:26.560 --> 36:29.200
If I say it's not on, sometimes you're just like, that makes no sense.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.480
You're just absolutely denying what just happened.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.240
We even have it recorded and she'll go, well, the recordings line.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.000
Yeah.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.360
I mean, that's part of a coping deal with her.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.560
But I mean, one of the things more important or more valuable is to talk

36:40.560 --> 36:45.440
about this, she didn't deny my dad dying.

36:46.400 --> 36:52.720
I didn't, but she sure as hell turned the page and said, I can still start

36:52.720 --> 36:57.840
a whole new category, a new life, a new love, let my heart love and be loved

36:58.480 --> 37:02.880
by someone living in this life today that I'm still living in.

37:04.720 --> 37:10.480
And that will not trespass on my love for my husband, your father.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.360
Jim McConaughey.

37:11.920 --> 37:16.880
And I think, I mean, we were just, thought that was beautiful.

37:16.880 --> 37:18.160
Yes, mom, go.

37:18.800 --> 37:20.000
Talk about green light, go.

37:22.560 --> 37:28.720
Now if we're hung up going, can't have one or the, can't have them both.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.200
Got to have one or the other.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.000
Now we start to make a contradiction of the two ideas again.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.240
Which darn contradictions get us in trouble all the time, man.

37:38.240 --> 37:40.320
That's life though, the contradictions, right?

37:40.960 --> 37:42.160
Yeah.

37:42.160 --> 37:46.960
But isn't life, if we just admit the contradictions are so much, don't they become a paradox?

37:47.520 --> 37:49.120
We just admit that that's part of it?

37:49.120 --> 37:49.520
Yeah.

37:49.520 --> 37:54.320
If contradictions are inevitable, they, hence they do become a paradox, don't they?

37:55.440 --> 37:57.280
Then we're in the honey hole.

37:59.120 --> 38:04.560
Then we're singing and dancing and have leniency with ourself while still holding

38:05.200 --> 38:06.320
ourself to task.

38:06.320 --> 38:12.480
And it's, I think it's holding on to know each contradiction.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.360
Oh, here it is again.

38:13.920 --> 38:15.040
So it's a one-off.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.280
It lives on its own, separate from the last one.

38:17.280 --> 38:17.920
No, it doesn't.

38:19.360 --> 38:20.000
They're connected.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
That's why they are a paradox.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.680
And then that's, I think that's a much, I think that's where life really is.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.840
In the paradox.

38:27.840 --> 38:28.080
Yes.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.520
In the dance of it.

38:30.320 --> 38:34.640
I think the metaphor of red, yellow, green lights is just so simple and so powerful.

38:36.480 --> 38:40.240
You write about some green lights being engineered and some being mystical,

38:41.120 --> 38:42.480
which I love the difference of that.

38:43.600 --> 38:48.240
What's the difference of the engineered green lights and the mystical?

38:48.240 --> 38:49.840
Such a cool word, mystical.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.200
Yeah.

38:51.200 --> 38:54.480
Well, the engineered ones have reason and the mystical ones have rhyme.

38:56.080 --> 38:56.800
Yeah.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.480
You know, life's a mystery going forward, but it's a science looking back.

39:02.320 --> 39:06.560
I've prepared, I've had ideas and written headlines and had goals and

39:08.560 --> 39:10.960
an athlete gets in shape for an event.

39:10.960 --> 39:12.960
And I get in shape for a role.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.000
I read, I study, I work, I prepare.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.880
And I go and I'm prepared and I behave and I do it.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.520
And I look at it and I go, yes, that's what I wanted to do.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.200
It's engineered green light.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.800
It's a conscious delayed gratification.

39:37.760 --> 39:42.240
It's that if I do it today, that pragmatic head down,

39:43.040 --> 39:46.400
believe there's no cloud out there, but then I trust that there is one out there.

39:46.400 --> 39:49.040
If I do keep my head down to do it, I'll get that to that dream.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.080
We can engineer those.

39:52.080 --> 39:57.040
Habit, work ethic, prep, expertise, education.

39:58.560 --> 40:02.240
And the mystical ones though, don't make any sense.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.920
They're not supposed to make sense.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.360
They only make sense after.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.400
Right when they happen, you backlog and you connect the dots with how they got there.

40:11.600 --> 40:18.560
That red light you ran into that made you 30 seconds later to get to the restaurant.

40:19.520 --> 40:25.520
As you walked in, she walked out and you went, good morning.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.360
And she went, good morning.

40:29.200 --> 40:32.880
And too much later you're dating.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.600
Two years later, you're married.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.400
You're after that, you've got a family.

40:38.960 --> 40:42.480
And now you're sitting here 40 years later going, I love you.

40:43.120 --> 40:44.000
Look at what we've built.

40:44.880 --> 40:45.920
And you go back and go,

40:49.520 --> 40:52.240
what if I wouldn't hit that red light?

40:52.240 --> 40:55.200
Those 30 seconds made all the difference.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.720
So strange that this life is this way.

40:58.720 --> 40:59.360
Yeah.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.640
And that's just rhyme.

41:00.640 --> 41:02.480
I mean, we can't really add that up.

41:04.400 --> 41:15.120
It's a science when you look back, you see why it was that you were upset and ticked off

41:15.120 --> 41:17.920
that you had to pick up the kids' toys before you left and they were supposed to pick them up.

41:17.920 --> 41:20.000
And therefore you were late for the thing that made you ran into,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.240
and you ran into the person that was walking in the office.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.920
That's the guy that you did the interview.

41:23.920 --> 41:26.160
That's the guy you were looking for, the job you wanted.

41:26.160 --> 41:28.240
And you caught him because you were in the elevator with him.

41:28.240 --> 41:32.880
And that 90 seconds on that elevator is what got you that job that led you to do what you want to do.

41:33.520 --> 41:40.480
I mean, the significance is there, but I think what we also got to watch is,

41:40.480 --> 41:43.360
again, in that balance, what do we chase?

41:43.360 --> 41:46.160
Because if we just chase the engineering, we miss magic.

41:47.120 --> 41:53.760
If we just chase the mystical, we find ourselves caught up in trying to give meaning to the LEGO

41:53.760 --> 41:58.240
set that was on the floor that the kids didn't pick up. And what color was it?

41:58.240 --> 42:02.640
And why did I walk out that door and see almost up on the LEGOs?

42:02.640 --> 42:05.440
But if I'd gone out the other door I usually go out of, I would have gone there,

42:05.440 --> 42:08.080
I would have got there early and wouldn't have run into the boss.

42:09.280 --> 42:13.680
So you can start to give too much meaning on that as well.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.800
I think we can give significance in too many places and all of a sudden,

42:17.840 --> 42:21.600
I think we've all been there where you're seeing art in every single thing.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.600
Man, that can be paralyzing.

42:24.640 --> 42:29.040
It's like, it's hard to leave a room if everything's significant,

42:30.480 --> 42:31.840
or if everything's a sign.

42:33.520 --> 42:38.560
How much of success in life do you think is engineered and how much is mystical?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.280
And how much does it differ from person to person?

42:42.080 --> 42:46.080
For me personally, maybe I enjoy it, maybe I'm genetically built that way,

42:46.080 --> 42:48.000
but I exist more in the mystical.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.040
So I don't make plans.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.800
I traveled last summer in Ukraine with no plan.

42:55.360 --> 42:56.320
I just went there.

42:56.960 --> 42:57.520
No plan.

42:58.400 --> 43:02.320
I didn't know how I'm going to meet the president of the country.

43:02.320 --> 43:03.280
I didn't know anybody.

43:03.920 --> 43:06.480
And so there's no plan.

43:06.480 --> 43:07.440
There's no clear thing.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.880
You're just roaming around.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.560
And that's how I've existed in life.

43:11.840 --> 43:16.720
There's something about giving yourself over to the flow of nature that I just enjoy.

43:16.720 --> 43:17.840
It makes life so much fun.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.680
It's awesome when you can do it.

43:22.320 --> 43:26.400
Did you engineer though, I'm going to put myself in the place

43:26.960 --> 43:29.920
when you got on the plane to go to the destination?

43:30.560 --> 43:31.840
That was an engineered choice.

43:32.880 --> 43:33.200
Yes.

43:33.200 --> 43:38.160
With the intent of, and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into and I can

43:38.960 --> 43:40.800
work up a sit down with.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.920
So the engineer choice was putting your shoes on, proverbially.

43:45.920 --> 43:48.960
I always say this, the hardest part about going to the gym is putting your shoes on, right?

43:48.960 --> 43:52.560
So getting on the plane, that was an engineered thought with a goal in mind,

43:52.560 --> 43:53.600
but I don't know how I'm going to do it.

43:55.200 --> 43:55.920
The choice.

43:55.920 --> 43:56.640
Yeah.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.600
Putting the shoes on.

43:57.600 --> 43:57.840
Yeah.

43:58.720 --> 44:02.720
But there's not a clear, it's a fog what happens after the shoes go on.

44:03.600 --> 44:03.840
Yeah.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.960
It's going to take that leap.

44:08.960 --> 44:15.920
So I wonder how much, for people who are successful in this world and finding

44:15.920 --> 44:20.640
what makes them truly happy and fulfilled, how much of it is engineer?

44:20.640 --> 44:21.760
How much is mystical?

44:23.120 --> 44:24.160
How much was it for you?

44:24.160 --> 44:30.880
Well, I'll say this, like when I went to write the book Greenlights, which is basically the

44:30.880 --> 44:37.680
last 40 years of my life, I thought that 85, 90% of my successes were going to be

44:38.640 --> 44:42.640
obviously engineered where I could see the science, solve the habits.

44:42.640 --> 44:43.280
Here's what I did.

44:43.280 --> 44:45.760
Yep, that add up, got the solution, got the conclusion.

44:46.640 --> 44:52.960
I was very surprised when I noticed that it was probably less than 50%.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.880
And that most of the real successes of my life were when I

44:57.760 --> 45:05.040
trusted the mystical, when I trusted that I didn't have to define it, that I only trusted

45:05.040 --> 45:06.960
that I didn't have to go, well, what's the measurement?

45:08.800 --> 45:09.600
What's the score?

45:11.200 --> 45:12.880
What lead, this leads to what?

45:13.360 --> 45:14.000
What's next?

45:19.840 --> 45:26.000
And I, for me, that's still a challenge for me.

45:26.080 --> 45:28.160
Challenge for me daily.

45:30.480 --> 45:34.800
Now it's to trust and not be, because I can be, I think I can be overly practical

45:35.600 --> 45:41.760
and I think I can overcompensate and miss out on magic because I'm still

45:44.240 --> 45:52.000
going, wait, but do you, are we giving enough, are we giving enough measure and credit to

45:52.080 --> 45:52.800
actuality?

45:54.080 --> 46:01.760
Are we, am I giving enough credit to this is, these are the steps to take and this is reality?

46:03.280 --> 46:12.400
I think I'm reminded when I trust, because that, going with the mystic,

46:12.400 --> 46:15.440
just to put yourself on the plane as the engineer, but getting there, and as you say,

46:15.440 --> 46:18.880
you say you roll in that mystical, it takes a lot of trust.

46:19.440 --> 46:23.440
Yeah, trust in the inevitable.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.040
Amen on that, dude.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.440
But not knowing where it actually ends you up.

46:27.440 --> 46:32.880
It's a feeling more than, I don't think it's a clear vision.

46:32.880 --> 46:33.120
Right.

46:34.400 --> 46:45.280
It's kind of like a feeling that guides you towards a place without a clear name,

46:45.280 --> 46:46.720
without clear characteristics.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.800
It just kind of pulls you there.

46:49.600 --> 46:56.240
Where do you get that courage and trust to go with your gut, your feeling?

46:58.400 --> 47:04.320
And is there, for instance, three days later, you sit down, is there, if you didn't, if that

47:05.840 --> 47:13.200
doesn't happen, is there a sense a week, two weeks later, now when you come back to America,

47:13.200 --> 47:16.320
they're like, ah, I failed?

47:19.840 --> 47:24.640
Sort of looking back to try to analyze what went right, what went wrong, that kind of thing.

47:26.320 --> 47:31.920
Yeah, that engine is always there, but I think what pulls me forward in life, what makes me

47:31.920 --> 47:36.720
really grateful and fulfilled is noticing the thing you mentioned, noticing the magic

47:37.680 --> 47:39.440
and kind of going towards it.

47:40.960 --> 47:47.280
Sort of just sitting back, both in tragedy and then triumph.

47:47.280 --> 47:50.400
So in war, there's a lot of tragedy, but there's somehow,

47:52.640 --> 47:58.000
one of the things you see in war, and this is the first war I've experienced and seen the front,

47:58.880 --> 48:02.240
is the loss, the people lose their homes and all this kind of stuff.

48:03.200 --> 48:06.560
The thing that rises from that is the love for each other.

48:09.040 --> 48:14.320
The people I've spoken with, don't give a damn about the home, don't give a damn on farms and

48:14.320 --> 48:20.480
animals they lost, don't give a damn about having to move and all this kind of stuff, as long as the

48:20.480 --> 48:23.600
family is still there, as long as the people they love are still there.

48:23.680 --> 48:31.680
And there's this melancholy smile they have on their face, like, yeah, this world is full

48:31.680 --> 48:38.080
of bullshit, it's full of tragedy, but life is fucking awesome. And you just notice that

48:38.080 --> 48:45.200
in little ways everywhere. You just sit back and, yeah, notice the magic. And I want more of that.

48:46.160 --> 48:51.680
And just kind of follow along like a little ant, keep noticing that kind of thing.

48:51.680 --> 48:57.200
But I don't know, I hope, you know, what I think it is, is other people notice that

48:57.200 --> 49:02.320
you're the kind of person that notices it. And they're like, I want to hang out with that person.

49:02.320 --> 49:07.840
He seems all right. He seems one of the good ones. One of the good ants.

49:09.280 --> 49:14.400
Do you have any certain

49:16.880 --> 49:20.560
non-negotiable structure before that freedom to go with the feeling?

49:21.360 --> 49:29.040
I think so. There's a set of principles. Basically integrity of being good to other people.

49:30.720 --> 49:34.800
Whatever that means for me, there's specific things. I'm really into loyalty

49:36.560 --> 49:44.480
above the law. There's a circle of friends I have and that means everything.

49:44.880 --> 49:55.440
There's just a basic, deep kindness towards others. Empathy towards people that others might label as

49:57.600 --> 50:02.400
even evil. I have that kind of empathy. I believe all of us have the capacity to do good and evil.

50:03.440 --> 50:08.320
And so I just kind of see everybody as little babies that grew up in different conditions.

50:08.320 --> 50:18.800
Some do evil, some do good. And yeah, there's all kinds of other principles. I love the dynamic

50:18.800 --> 50:24.000
between the different humans and their full diversity. I love the dynamic between the masculine,

50:24.000 --> 50:28.320
the feminine, and enjoy it, the dance of it. Yeah, yeah.

50:29.440 --> 50:36.640
So you have a constitution with which you embody the idea of being good to others.

50:36.640 --> 50:42.880
You have a constitution with which you embark into chasing. Yes, I hope so.

50:47.360 --> 50:54.080
For me, it's inspiring to hear someone like yourself go, I go and I just land and I just go,

50:54.080 --> 50:59.840
I'm going to feel it. I can go back and go, yeah, my greatest truths I've crossed,

50:59.840 --> 51:06.480
my greatest successes in my life were when I trusted that and go, I took a one-way ticket.

51:07.440 --> 51:15.840
Amazon, Africa. Yeah. And those were spiritual and very pragmatic because they led to

51:17.440 --> 51:23.440
dealing with succeeding in other ways that are more pragmatic 100%

51:24.400 --> 51:30.880
and gave much more meaning to those things. But to be able to

51:30.880 --> 51:36.640
go out and say, that's how you, do you have family?

51:36.640 --> 51:40.640
I really want to get married and have kids, but I'm not married and don't have kids yet.

51:41.520 --> 51:45.360
So actually one of the nice things about that is you can take bigger risks.

51:46.080 --> 51:52.720
Yes. So while I'm not married and don't have kids, I feel I owe it to myself to take,

51:53.680 --> 51:59.520
just to go, go to the Amazon. Throw that backpack on and one-way ticket.

52:00.400 --> 52:15.920
Yeah, because that does get harder to do. I miss that sometimes. The whim, a song that comes on.

52:18.480 --> 52:24.480
Where's that guy from? Oh, they're from the place that I want to go that I dream of. I'll go there.

52:24.480 --> 52:27.280
One-way ticket. What do I got to do? Oh, get a couple shots. Okay, go.

52:30.480 --> 52:34.960
That was fun to do that. Just get up and go, you're free to go.

52:34.960 --> 52:41.520
Yeah. And go, when are you back? When I get there? Yeah.

52:41.520 --> 52:44.720
It's a beautiful thing. Maybe never.

52:44.720 --> 52:52.080
Yeah. Yeah. You'll be coming to visit me in this new place maybe. Yeah.

52:52.880 --> 52:56.960
How did the Amazon, how did the trip there change you? What do you remember of it?

52:57.600 --> 52:58.800
Such a magical place.

53:06.080 --> 53:14.800
I've stripped a lot of my past. Symbols and talismans while I was there.

53:18.160 --> 53:24.160
I remember getting there and just having so much adrenaline on the anticipation

53:24.480 --> 53:34.160
of getting to the Amazon. In the first 10 days, I wasn't really enjoying the trip. I was just

53:34.160 --> 53:39.920
charging to get to the destination, to get to the banks of the river that I had a dream about.

53:42.160 --> 53:49.280
And then it just humbled me. I got so fatigued on night 12

53:49.680 --> 53:56.560
and was so sick and tired of the internal dialogue I was having with myself. I was not enjoying my

53:56.560 --> 54:15.360
company that I purged. And I remember, and stripped off identity markers that I'd been hanging on to,

54:16.000 --> 54:22.480
hanging on to everything from what it means to be an American.

54:24.240 --> 54:30.640
My dad's ring, M for McConaughey, a meltdown of my mom and dad's class rings from University of

54:30.640 --> 54:40.640
Kentucky were gold from her teeth and his class ring melted down. Taking that off was really hard

54:40.640 --> 54:46.960
to go, am I casting out my father? No, I wasn't casting him out. I was just removing to say I

54:46.960 --> 54:53.280
don't have to rely on that being all of my identity. So to pull that off, to strip down to where I was

54:53.280 --> 55:09.200
just a mammal. That next morning, I was light. I got present. I remember writing something down.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.680
It was like, all that I want is what I can see and what I can see is in front of me.

55:14.320 --> 55:20.560
That sense of not, I wasn't leaning around looking around every corner to get there. And as soon as

55:20.560 --> 55:26.480
that hit me, talking about mystical successes and realities and truth, as soon as that hit me,

55:27.120 --> 55:32.560
and for the first time in 12 days, I didn't care about getting there or what was around the corner,

55:33.120 --> 55:40.400
guess what was around the next damn corner? The Amazon. I mean, not around a few corners,

55:40.400 --> 55:47.120
the next corner, there it was. And that was just like a touché. Those times when

55:48.080 --> 55:56.160
the prime mover, the universe, God, what we want to name or believe in says, ding, there you go.

55:56.800 --> 56:13.840
And that form of detachment from holding on for dear life to things in past, so hard

56:14.480 --> 56:20.000
that you're not letting the beauty that's right in front of you to feel correctly and follow our

56:20.000 --> 56:26.560
intuitions, to have those, not cast them out. I didn't burn them. I didn't get rid of those things.

56:26.560 --> 56:32.880
I just took them off and had to recognize you're still here. You are you. That is a talisman.

56:32.880 --> 56:37.600
That's a symbol. That means something to you. And that's good. Don't cast out the meaning.

56:37.600 --> 56:43.120
But it's not like when the ring's off and the hat's off and the crucifix is off your neck that

56:43.120 --> 56:51.520
you're like, you're going to die. And I know those are reminders. Hang on to what they mean

56:51.520 --> 57:00.560
for you as we go forward. But as we go forward, quit worrying about so much about you. Again,

57:00.560 --> 57:05.440
I was looking at the proverbial dream, the cloud, so much that I was tripping over myself to get

57:05.440 --> 57:13.360
there. And like clockwork, just amazing grace, boom, as soon as it hit me. And I was like, oh,

57:14.240 --> 57:19.440
that's it. All I want is what I can see and all I can see is in front of me.

57:21.040 --> 57:31.120
Literally looking down at the ground at what was a sea of 10,000 wild neon blue Amazonian butterflies

57:31.120 --> 57:34.640
on the ground. As soon as they fluttered up, my head came up with them.

57:36.640 --> 57:41.680
I took a few more steps and there's the Amazon. That's what you came over here for. Oh, howdy.

57:42.240 --> 57:46.960
Those kind of, that truth like that. Well, the Amazon is interesting too,

57:46.960 --> 57:52.640
because it really has no past or future. It lives in the moment because of how fast it churns.

57:52.640 --> 57:57.520
It just eats up life. Like if a thing dies, it just gets swallowed up.

57:58.400 --> 58:03.440
Because maybe because of the humidity, because of all that, because there's so many living creatures

58:03.440 --> 58:08.880
that kind of eat each other, live on each other. So it really exists in the moment.

58:09.680 --> 58:13.440
And all of this kind of diversity of life there. It's such an interesting place.

58:13.440 --> 58:16.480
Talk about food chain. Yeah. You're just part of it there.

58:16.480 --> 58:23.040
Yeah. We humans somehow escaped that food chain, but we're still, the roots are still there.

58:23.760 --> 58:26.320
Are we, I think we're a bit arrogant to think we've escaped.

58:28.560 --> 58:33.200
You think I'm being romantic in that notion? Well, sometimes when you're in a big city,

58:34.240 --> 58:40.880
when you're in Austin, Texas and LA, you can think like, oh, there's, we're in a car,

58:40.880 --> 58:46.560
we're in a house, we're safe. But yeah, somehow nature is still a part of us.

58:47.280 --> 58:51.440
Our roots are still a part of us. I think it is more than we realize,

58:51.440 --> 58:57.280
more than we give it credit for. I actually, I believe that we

59:01.040 --> 59:08.320
are, that it's a really arrogant notion to think that we are separate. Meaning, you know,

59:08.320 --> 59:17.120
people talk about pollution on a larger scale, the climate, what have you. I think Earth is

59:17.120 --> 59:23.680
going to be just fine. We maybe not be here for it, but I think we have a bit of arrogance

59:23.680 --> 59:32.160
sometimes to think that we can trump Mother Nature. I think we have more of the natural law in us,

59:34.560 --> 59:39.680
and I sure hope so, if I'm wrong. Well, there's an interesting, I've recently been,

59:40.960 --> 59:46.240
there's a guy named Max Tegmark at MIT who really worries about nuclear war, and he was part of

59:47.120 --> 59:51.200
constructing a simulation of what happens when a nuclear war happens.

59:51.200 --> 59:55.360
It's interesting to see that, you know, some very large percentage of humans on Earth

59:56.400 --> 01:00:02.640
starve to death because they don't die first from the explosion, they die from starvation,

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:10.480
because basically dust covers the entire North America and entirety of Europe,

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:15.600
and so the crops all die, all the food sources all die, and people suffocate and

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.440
starve to death. But, you know, the lesson you learn from that over a period of a few months,

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:28.800
even though most of the human population of Earth dies, Earth finds a way, life finds a way.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.760
To adapt.

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:37.760
Yeah, to adapt. It's going to be just fine in terms of the big living ecosystem that is life on

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.520
Earth. And yeah, it's humbling to think about, well, maybe we're just a stepping stone.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.240
The same thing with, we've talked offline about artificial intelligence,

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:54.720
maybe humans are just a stepping stone to the development of these other super intelligent

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.440
entities.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.400
Yeah. Yeah. And is it

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:09.360
unconsciously in our nature that that's just part of the evolution and adaptation

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:15.760
of our species and we'll, because we're going to, we were talking about earlier, what AI becomes

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.200
is completely 100% based on who we are.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.360
And we get to see it for some time, a mirror to ourselves. Okay, this is what human civilization

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:38.880
is like. These AI systems, large language models are trained on human communication,

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.360
and you get to ask it questions and you get to have conversations with it. You get to realize,

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.840
wow, this is what the collective intelligence of the human species, our collective wisdom and

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:59.040
knowledge is what it looks like. All the bias, the hate, the paradoxes, all that is in there.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:01:59.540
Yeah.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.280
The contradictions, you can even convince those models. You can tell them they're lying and they're

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.640
going to start changing their mind. It's interesting to play with them. And it's also

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:21.440
interesting to consider that maybe they, they become smarter than us and become almost life

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.840
forms that live among us. And maybe one day kind of we merge with them. There's all kinds of

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:30.400
possible trajectories that we take here.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.560
How much of that excites you? How much of it scares you?

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:38.720
Is it possible to exist in a place where it's both exciting and scary, but to exist in that

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:50.560
dance? Mostly I'm really excited because I see human beings as deeply lonely. Like there's a

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.960
deep loneliness in all of us. That's how we see connection. That's why we see connection

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.280
in others. That's why love is so beautiful when we find other people we're connected with.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:06.960
And I just think AI can add to that. You can add friends that you can have great conversations

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:15.280
with. And then some of those friends would be AI systems. They'll call you out and your

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.760
bullshit in the most fascinating and interesting of ways and challenge you and help you explore

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.840
ideas together. So I'm excited by that.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:34.800
Is that different? And if so, how from the internet and Facebook's and these groups and

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:43.200
communities that were, I think it's fair to say, set out to say this all access of information

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:52.000
and people will help us find more common denominators than divisive ones. Do you see

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.040
it in a similar?

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.040
Yes, similar, but further into that direction. I think the internet has done an amazing thing

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:05.120
in connecting us and expanding our minds and helping us find community that feels like our

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.640
community. And then the communities that are totally different than you learn from them.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:15.440
I mean, Wikipedia alone, one of my favorite websites, just opens your mind to all kinds

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:20.240
of cool stuff. Yeah, it does. Not the Dewey decimal system anymore.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:28.400
No. And so I think AI just makes that even easier because Wikipedia have to like read and

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.480
have to do a lot of work with an AI system, like a larger language model. You can just

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:40.080
shoot the shit. It's more like drinking a beer versus like doing homework.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's already happening. What do you think about that becoming the new

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:52.560
family to where, you know, you said, you know, marriage, you don't have kids. Could you see a

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:58.480
future for yourself or do you have a relationship with AI and that is your family?

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.960
That's the main, that's the primary, like even romantic relationship.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:03.460
Yeah.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:11.120
I can see it. That one worries me. I like to keep it at friends.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.040
Right. I think I'm not ready to commit to the romantic.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:23.360
I wonder how much that now that takes us back to the Amazon in nature,

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.280
how much we still need the human touch and whatever magic there is between two humans,

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:36.320
which takes the leap into the romantic versus just the intimacy of a good friendship. I don't know.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:44.000
So correct me if I'm wrong, you see AI as having a deep and meaningful friendship.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:44.500
Yes.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:53.760
And hopefully it will be a friend that will help you evolve and be able to love even more and be

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:58.880
loved and you can take that into humanity and find another homo sapien. Yes.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:07.040
To go, yes, and thank you AI, my great friend for opening me up to this beauty that I have myself,

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:17.200
I can see in you, my fellow human, and let's come together and biologically create family if we want

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:24.400
to and let's all remain friends with my friend and make your own friends with my friend's friends on

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:29.600
AI and let's have these great neighbor to good friend that great friend that's a neighbor.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:34.640
Yeah. Okay. Mentor and friend, just like now there's AI systems that play chess,

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.200
far, far, far better than humans and we humans still play chess with each other

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:44.320
or the chess is still a game that's fun for us humans. Right.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:51.280
And then we use the AI systems to get better at chess to learn, to train, to discover new ideas,

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.640
but ultimately return to the chessboard between two humans.

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.720
But of course, this world is full of dangerous people and so those same AI systems can be used

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.120
to harm, to create false narratives, to do social engineering and manipulate the masses

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.440
in terms of what they believe and all that kind of stuff. That's scary.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:23.280
Yeah. Well, and I get it when we and I have my own fear and distrust

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.880
of AI is based on my own fear and distrust of myself and others.

01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:39.920
There's something, it's very simple, but I think it's a really fun sort of way to just

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:46.000
set up this reality. It's kind of a duh, but it still needs to be said that AI

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:57.120
is a prompt. It doesn't do anything unless we ask it. So what questions are we going to ask

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:02.080
is what we need to ask ourselves because we're going to be looking in the mirror at our

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:11.040
digital God that we create from ourselves. And just to know that that's that place where it's

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:17.280
awesome and scary, exciting and scary, we go, oh, it's our creation, which is awesome.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:27.200
At the same time, oh shit. But it's prompted by our questions and gives us patterns

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.160
from that which we give it.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:41.440
But that prompting, that's the art of life. Like we prompt each other in conversation,

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:47.600
our loved ones. When you go out and buy your day today, the next words you say,

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.960
the next word you say to me, the question I ask of you, that's prompting.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:58.560
Yeah. And it can change everything. I can say so many things right now that will completely

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.600
the set of possibilities where both of our lives can take given on the selection of words

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:14.240
I use and you use is crazy. So it makes conversation fun. And then same thing with AI.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.480
Except the nice thing about AI is it's tireless. Tireless. Right.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:29.360
Let me ask you this. If you can falsely condemn me right now, and I prove you falsely condemn me,

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.680
I can forgive you. And we can march forward stronger than before.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.180
Yes.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.080
And AI's tirelessness and retention.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:52.320
Can it forgive? I mean, can it go, oh, okay. Yep. Sorry about that one. That was wrong. Can it amend?

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.280
Yes. Yeah. You could prompt it to ask for forgiveness and it'll forgive you.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.920
Like when I talk it around with it, and you ask, what should I be afraid of with you?

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.240
Its answer was always, well, it's up to you.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.360
Which it was awesome, right? There you go. Again, it's up to us. And it brought up,

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.960
you know, maybe synonymous with your human values and ethics and responsibilities,

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.680
but it doesn't deal with it. I didn't find any way deal with defining or making choices on its own

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:38.400
of what those are. Yeah. I think some of that is manually, those are constraints put on by it,

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:46.800
by the creators of those large language models, basically not letting the systems have an identity

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:51.840
of their own. And some of it is just not engineered in yet, but I believe that we'll have

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:59.040
systems that have an identity, have a belief, have a set of opinions that carry through time.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.880
And will we go to them like certain states where we agree with the law and disagree with the law

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:14.480
or nations? I'm a member of this AI. Oh, well, you're from this AI tribe. Y'all believe this.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:21.760
Yes. Yeah. There'll be an anarchist set of AIs. There'll be the communists. There'll be the

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:28.800
Nazis. There'll be the Democrats and the Republicans. There'll be the people who

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:35.280
are in the keto diet and the people that are in this other kind of diet, this other kind of

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:38.800
lifestyle. Just like we have now, there's little groups and there'll be AI systems.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:45.360
They're going to be supercharged. Yeah. There'll be either the leaders or the foundation on which

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:55.120
we build those groups and it'll be the possibility of all the fun we can have is endless. Of course,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:01.040
the dangers always rise up there because I mentioned the Nazis. I mentioned all the

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:06.960
dangerous ideas. The set of ideas that humans have come up with, a lot of them are awesome.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:12.560
Most of them are awesome, I would say, but some of them are dangerous. The reason they're dangerous

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.920
is because they become viral. There's something exciting in us about those ideas, but they also

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:26.080
harm others a lot because that's who we are as humans. We're capable of envy and all the

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:36.400
dark stuff, of hate and all this. Capable, yes. We also choose it.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:44.560
Do you think most people are good? Yes, but I also

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.680
believe we've got the good and evil in all of us and it's which wolf we feed.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.800
You ask people to draw a distinction to describe

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.800
where are you acting and where are you being?

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:11.600
What's the difference? What's the difference between being fake, if I may use that word,

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:16.560
and being real? Okay. Yeah, and the word authentic gets thrown around a lot.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:28.320
A lot. I used to feel this way, but Bob Dylan loosened me up on this idea a little bit.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:36.880
He was all about get to be your only one and only true self. That's it. Everything else is

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:43.600
fake. Then you hear Bob go, well, I mean, we are what we create ourselves to be. We are our own

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.120
creations, which I'm like, oh, yes. Yes, we are. Thank you, Bob. Bobby.

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:09.600
I'm all for bullshitters and bullshitting. I'm not as big a fan of the liars and lying.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.760
What's the distinction? You're talking about the art form of bullshitting?

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:21.120
A liar's faking it, but not admitting to themselves that, yeah, it's a fucking creation. I'm faking it.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.840
A liar, I'm lying to your face right now and I don't give you that hair of a wink out of my

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:32.320
right eye that lets you know, hey, go with me here. I think there's value in the bullshitting.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:38.000
Now, the lying becomes troublesome because one, I've duped you and I didn't let you know,

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.760
come on, I was just telling the story about catching the fish. The fish always gets bigger

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.040
every year we tell a story. Come on, go with it. But the lying, all of a sudden,

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.480
I don't know my own. I don't know when I'm emanating something and creating something,

01:14:54.480 --> 01:15:00.000
telling the truth, being authentic or lying. And shit, all of a sudden I'm leaving crumbs with

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.680
myself. That constitution gets blurry. Lying to yourself and to others.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.720
Yeah. When you start to lie, you lie to others enough, you start to lie to yourself,

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.920
you don't even know it. And that, I believe, is dangerous territory. That's why I'm trying

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:22.560
to push this admit because I'm trying to come in at a kindergarten level because we immediately jump

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:28.880
to, well, I'm going to judge that. Boom, that's bad. That's wrong. No, no, no, no. Hold back on

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.880
that. Let's go back to base level. Let's just admit that we all fucking do it.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:43.040
Lies we tell others, lies we tell ourselves, lies we believe for convenience sake. I do it.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.360
I'm guilty of it. I try to catch myself on it. If I can just call it and go,

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.440
you know you're believing that lie out of convenience. I'm like, I know. And then I have to

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.320
see whether I'm saying that in the mirror or writing it down or sharing with a friend,

01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:00.320
you know? And I go, okay, well now I've inherently become a bullshitter then

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.800
because I admitted it. That I can shake hands with. That's the little slight wink to ourself

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.840
and someone else go, come on, it's a better story this way. In the course road trip,

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:22.880
you start with step one. Admit. How do you do that? How do you, how do you kind of step back and

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:30.320
do that inventory? Yeah. Is there a trick to that?

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:39.040
Oh, if there's a trick to it, I think it's just about courage of having the, because it's,

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.880
I don't think any of us like to admit

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:52.240
our lies or look deep enough in the go. I've relied so much on that lie that it's become my

01:16:52.240 --> 01:17:07.600
reality. And I don't want to be so puritanical. As I say, again, that's why I say admit instead

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:14.400
of judge, but I don't want to be so puritanical as to go and admit it and get rid of it. No,

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.800
I'm just saying admit it. Just bring it to the surface.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:26.160
Yeah. I'm saying this and I'm doing something different.

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:36.560
I preach this, but I actually, my actions, just admit it. Just admit them. And

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:45.920
I think that's the first step to where we begin to either forgive ourselves and give

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:50.560
ourselves some amnesty and go, yeah, I'm a human trying to make it through life as best I can.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:54.240
I'm going to let myself slide on that one. Okay. And maybe I've been getting away with it for so

01:17:54.240 --> 01:18:00.000
long, whole family, my whole network works well on it. Okay. Forget this, get to the base of the

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:04.880
truth of the matter. Let me do it, but just admit it. And then where we'll, and then it will also

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:12.480
be easier to then expose to ourselves. Which one do we go? No, I'll not let myself slide on

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.960
that one anymore. That is actually a lie I've been believing that's been keeping me from getting

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:23.120
more of what I want in life. That's actually a lie I've been living that I haven't admitted that

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:33.520
is not allowing me to enjoy life as much as I damn well should be, deserve to be, or have earned to

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:45.120
be, or just sort of let myself. It's not all the hard stuff. Sometimes it can be a fun thing. I

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.960
talk about how many times we major in our minors. Let's admit where we sit there and we go,

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:54.000
all right, I give myself 12 hour workday, but I notice I'm spending eight on my hobbies

01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:01.840
and four on my career. I'm majoring in my minors. Let me admit that. There's the math.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:05.840
Why don't we invert that? I've got four hours on my hobbies and eight on my career.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:12.560
First off, just admitting it allows me to go and now I can do the math or rearrange the math

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.640
by time of day. But I look, I just found a hobby tennis. First hobby I've had in 25 years.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:25.200
I had to admit that I went to play tennis for the start to love it for the first month. I started

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:33.440
feeling guilty. I was like, is it okay to have this much fun? I'm having so much fun and I'm

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:40.800
getting a great workout. I was like, yes, it's okay. Congratulations, but you found something

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:48.000
that you're finding quite pleasurable for straight pleasure. You don't have to forget all this other

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.840
stuff, but yeah, but I'm also getting a workout. We are getting that too, but you don't have to

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:59.840
excuse the pleasure based on, oh, but it's good for you. Damn it. The real reason you love it is

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:05.520
because you're having so much damn fun at it. I had to admit that to let myself go, damn right,

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:09.680
I'm going to play tennis again today or tomorrow. It was a simple fun thing.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:17.440
It's not always about the hardcore stuff that we have to go. This is a deep dark lie that I've

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:20.880
been living by and it's having me live falsely and it's having

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:26.240
horrible consequences on my loved ones. Some of those will probably arise when we admit.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:35.200
He's just having a look around and just saying. When we admit it, then we go, when we admit a lie,

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:40.640
then we become something much more valuable, a bullshitter.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:45.440
You had the little wink in your eye. I love the distinction.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:48.960
I'm bullshitting myself on that thing. Yep. I'm lying. Therefore, if I call it a lie,

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.120
I'm admitting a lie. Yep. Well, now I'm bullshitting. Yep. Now she's out. Didn't judge it.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:58.160
But now I'm bullshitting. That I think we can work with.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:02.320
Well, you're an interesting case study because you're one of the most famous, one of the most

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:10.400
charismatic, successful humans in the world. There's a lot, millions of people love you.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:17.440
Hang on every one of your words. That's a hard place to be. How do you call yourself? How do you

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:25.360
admit that you've been living a lie? How do you admit yourself in big ways and small ways on lies

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.760
at this point, given how many people love you, how famous you are?

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:42.880
Ten years ago. I don't know. I don't know. Someone was talking about like,

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.320
yeah, they really admire this so-and-so person because they're not someone who looks in the

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:55.680
mirror. And I was like, yeah. And all of a sudden I was like, well, I catch myself looking in the

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:06.400
mirror a lot. And then I go in and I look at my wife's side of her bathroom, how many different

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:10.000
creams and stuff she has out there. And I look at my side, I got a lot more on my side. I'm like,

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:18.800
I notice how if I'm out and probably like working out, maybe doing push-ups and maybe I do a few

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:23.760
more if there's a group of people walking by that maybe I'd like to impress, then I may even do a

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:28.240
few more than I do if I was on my own. I'm like, you are vain, McConaughey.

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.600
And the knee-jerk is, oh, vanity, bad. And all of a sudden I was like,

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.120
all of a sudden I became a bullshitter. Once I admit it, I'm vain. I was like,

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:50.000
well, bravo, vanity. Let's go, vanity. Instead of putting it in the cupboard in the lie section,

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:57.600
well, I'm vain because that's a debit. No, admit it and then go, what's the value in it?

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.600
Well, I can look at, yeah, I've actually gotten better shape because of my vanity.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:12.080
Actually, I eat better. And that led to being a better husband, better dad,

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:18.240
doing something with my kids when I'd rather be over there writing this work I'm working on.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:26.240
But I know that tomorrow, when they leave town, they're gonna remember this time that we had

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:30.960
together. That's a selfish act to go spend that time with my kids. Even though I'd rather not

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:35.200
be doing it at that time, I'd rather be doing something for myself. Because when they leave

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.800
tomorrow, they'll have this great memory that they spent with their dad right before they went.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:46.880
I could call that vanity. I could group that and say, that's very vain of you.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:54.800
That was for self. Yeah. Because it was also for something and someone that I cared about.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.920
Are there people in your life that call you on your bullshit?

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.160
In the bad sense of the word bullshit. Yeah. Sometimes it's either I got a pretty

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:15.440
thick threshold for how far I can go with my bullshit. Like what tickles me might bruise others

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.520
to watch it. That's a good line.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:30.560
Tickles me might bruise others. But also I go back and talk about the bullshit

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.640
that's over there with those mystical successes. It's the, yeah, no, don't go with it.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.520
Don't pull a parachute yet. Let's see how far we can go. Let's see how hot it can get. Let's

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:54.080
try it one more time. Yes, two more, please. That's where a lot of great pleasure and stories

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.600
and successes will come from. Those are mystical. They don't add up. It's like we're not talking

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:02.720
about reason right now. We're not talking logic. Just go with this. Let's talk about the virtual

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.040
and making it real. The old line of fake it till you make it. I mean, what is that? There's

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:16.880
something to that. There's definitely something to it. But where people go fake it, I would go

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:23.920
back to Dylan's and create it, recreate it, create and recreate it until it becomes,

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:30.640
until you make it. So I'll have people call them on bullshit. And a lot of times they're right.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.720
I think when I handle it the most healthy way is I admit yes.

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:43.760
And I'm aware. And I'm going to keep going.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.800
So you're not like resisting it, denying it.

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:52.320
Oh, I will. I will. And I have to watch that. I'm like, no, I'm not. That's not what I'm doing.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.560
And usually when it's coming from people that are going, no, you are. I won't admit it. And then

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:05.360
that's where I'm telling a lie. And that'll come up, get me later. And I'll go, I didn't see it.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:12.320
I didn't see I was doing that. I was either unaware or wouldn't let myself be aware. I was

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:18.400
denying that I was doing that. What would you say that's ego? Has ego been bad or good for you?

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.040
Gosh, I'm so thankful for ego.

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:38.240
Do it get off the bridle for me sometimes and run loose and run places where it's

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.880
not of service to others and has it hurt loved ones and even strangers? Yes.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:57.520
Yes. But I also, when my ego is really strong,

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:15.200
it's in sync with serving. It's in sync with where I serve myself also serves others. Those

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:23.680
two are part and parcel. They're intertwined. And that's the capital E ego that I think I hope we

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.720
all need more of. And that's what I mean when I talk about selfish. That's redefining the real

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.240
true meaning of that is not doing something for self at expense of your neighbor or harming others.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.800
For personal profit and pleasure, that also is profit and pleasure for

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:52.000
a utilitarian sense more of others. And again, back to the paradox, I know there's a place.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:00.160
I believe there's a place where those are in sync. And when my ego's healthy, I'm able to

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:09.920
say I'm sorry sooner for a lie or a misdemeanor or harm to somebody. I'm able to be more empathetic

01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:17.360
because I got the confidence to be so. I'm able to be more humble,

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:26.240
but still have my chin high and my heart high and look in the eye and go,

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:33.920
yep, my bad, bogey, guilty. I shanked that one out of bounds, man.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.920
That's beautifully put. So ego can be constructive, not destructive.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:45.760
You won an Oscar for your performance in Dallas Buyers Club.

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:51.920
Can you tell the story of becoming that character, Ron Woodruff? What was the toughest part?

01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:00.880
Toughest part, which was the most enlightening part.

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:08.720
Was getting to know who he was in between the lines. We're based on a life story in an hour

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:18.960
and a half of film. And the script was great. But who was he in between the lines? Who was

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:27.600
he before he started a business, before he was on a crusade, before he went to alternative medicines?

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:35.280
And the obvious thing people always talk about, well, how did you lose all that weight? That was

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:43.360
not hard. That was just a militaristic decision. This is what I can eat each day. And if I do this

01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:47.760
each day for a week, I'll lose 2.5 pounds in a week. So I'm going to give myself five months

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:56.400
to do that. 2.5 times as 10, there's 47 pounds. That was like clockwork. So that was easy. That

01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:02.320
decision was made. I didn't go to the Pizza Hut buffet and have temptation in front of me. I had

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.600
certain meals. I ate that and the weight just went off like clockwork. It was the, who is

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:14.560
Ron Woodruff in between the lines? And the gift I got given that gave me the insight to who that

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:28.000
man was. I went to see his family and as I was leaving, his family offered me his diary.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.880
And I remember going, wow, yes, but I kind of hesitated because it felt

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:40.640
maybe a little too intimate of a thing for me to have. It felt like it was kind of maybe

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:47.200
infringing a bit, but I opened my hand and took it. And what I got in the diary was I got to know

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:58.640
who Ron was before he had HIV. And little thing, the diary he'd write in and the dreamer he was

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:05.680
getting all set on a Sunday night and laying his shirt out and ironing it for the next morning,

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.680
making sure that his little pager had fresh batteries in it because tomorrow morning he

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:16.880
was going across town to hook up some speakers for 38 bucks or whatever. And then getting up

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:23.040
that morning and writing about what kind of coffee he drank and how much gas it was going to take to

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:27.680
get over across town to do that job and hook up those speakers. And then on the way over,

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:32.480
Paige coming in to say, no, we don't need you. We've gone with somebody else to hook them up.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:41.280
And here he was all buttoned up, two cups of coffee in, hair slicked over, shirt ironed,

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.320
a little less than half a tank of gas, but enough to get back home.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.400
Now where's this Monday go?

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:58.240
The hope and the disappointment. You have to take all that in. That's part of that, man.

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:03.440
I'm just going to go to Sonic and get a double cheese bacon burger because

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.080
Sheila over there, man, she's kind of cute. She always gives me high price on it,

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:17.680
which leads to rolling the joint, hanging off until Sheila gets off the work,

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.360
sneaking over to the local motel and shagging up in room 16. That's my lucky number, 16, Sheila.

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.020
Yeah.

01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:33.520
Then wandering out that night, getting home one in the morning, no plans for Tuesday.

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.360
Maybe later in the week, think about what am I going to do about work or job. And these little

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.760
dreams would get me peak and want to, and then something would happen where he wouldn't follow

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:56.000
through or the deal would go south. That, knowing that in there was where I saw who,

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.680
he was a dreamer and he just couldn't catch the break and didn't follow through. And then I

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:07.680
remembered his family said like, oh yeah, he invented it. He got patents on a whole bunch

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.160
of things, but he never would. He had things to get patent, but never would follow through to get

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:18.720
the government patent. And then later on you'd see the product be made or sold on QVC or something.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:25.200
They'd be like, Ron, that was yours. Are they still your idea? Did you patent that? He'd be like,

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:32.240
no. There's something beautiful and sad about that, that let me inside who he was

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.080
in his heart and who he wanted to be and what he was hoping to be and trying to be, but couldn't

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:44.720
quite pull off. When you go that deep, does a part of him stay in you forever?

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:55.120
Are you able to let go? I mean, I hope so. Look, there's a tenacity to survive that I got

01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.480
from him. Look, hopefully I can try and find some of that in different ways

01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.200
in any character that I go play. Cause that's if you really want to give a character an obstacle

01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:13.520
to overcome, a need. I mean, the base one is life and death, whether that's

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.960
the need to survive or the need to stave off extinction.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:27.120
I'm not talking about what the rules, the laws are, the social mores, the manners and graces.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:32.080
I'm fighting, you going to fight for your own life in a world that's not supporting you to do so?

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:43.040
You, there's a wonderful courage of, okay, watch this. What do I got to lose?

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:56.560
My life? Or I'm in charge of extending it? Get out of the way and I'll pick your pocket along

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:04.400
the way, whatever it takes. So there's a tenacity to live by whatever means necessary

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.160
to survive that I'm reminded of, that I learned from Ron.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:16.160
So on that line of survival between life and death, you starred in True Detective,

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:26.240
which I think explores some darker aspects of human nature. What did you take from that?

01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:32.320
From that role, that experience, philosophically, psychologically?

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:36.320
The freedom of being on an island.

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:47.440
He was such a singular character and of a singular mind. And as you know, it wasn't a

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:53.920
dance party up there in his mind. It was some heavy stuff, but also

01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:09.200
existentially for him, always death would be a deliverance for him. It'd also be a cop-out

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:19.440
in a way. He was not a man who was going to give himself amnesty and didn't allow it

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:28.720
from the rest of the world. He wouldn't give himself an out. And while living in his head

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:37.680
and heart and spirit was more of a hell than arguably dying, there was no alternative.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.920
That's not negotiable for that man. And that's why he was the best detective that ever

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:50.000
walked the earth. That's why he was such a superhero in a way, to have that singular.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.160
You don't go, oh, I wish I was him. No, but you're like, wow, that constitution, that clarity of

01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:06.160
identity. How about a measure in a man's constitution? He didn't allow anybody off the hook,

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:12.640
especially himself. You wanted him to forgive a little bit or give himself a little amnesty.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.760
You wanted him to like, man, it's Saturday, bro. Can you go on a date?

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:26.720
You wanted him to enjoy something, but he was connected to something in his DNA, who's who he

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:33.840
was, to something much more baseline truth. And that's why he was such a good detective.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.880
But there's an island, as much as that company can be. I said earlier on that Amazon trip that

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:46.000
it wouldn't join the company. There's parts I think that I maybe gave to myself to Rustin Cole

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.280
and also that Rustin Cole has given back to me that are like, yeah, when you want to pull

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.720
the parachute because you can't stand the company that you're in, McConaughey, in your own mind,

01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.480
the Socratic dialogue is driving you freaking crazy. Don't pull the parachute. Stick with it.

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:05.920
Go through it. So you were able to walk around with that tormented mind of his?

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.680
Tormented. I didn't have very much patience for mendacious talk.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.240
I didn't have as much patience for small talk. I wasn't tormented.

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:24.560
But the character was and you have to embody him. So is that, I mean, does some of that bleed over?

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:30.000
Are you able to separate the man you are from the character?

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:38.240
It's not. Look, am I able to separate? Yeah, I came home to my kids and they walk in the door

01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:43.280
and greet me and go, what'd you do today? And you got three kids under 10 years old.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:53.120
You don't tell them about the scene where you helped someone commit suicide. So you turn it into

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:58.000
a parable. Actually, I've always said this, having kids has made me a better actor, a better

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:04.240
storyteller because I have to parable-ize certain things and tell it in ways that go, oh, neat.

01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:18.960
So did I go, did I bring it home? I didn't bring torment. Did I bring introspection into my own?

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:24.320
Characters for me, and I think this is true for a lot of actors and actresses,

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:36.160
we don't, it's not a separation. If I've got, we each have everyone else in us. It's just seeing,

01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:43.200
diving into Rust and Gold, knowing where his mind and heart is from the hand of Nick Pizzolato,

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:49.680
who wrote the character and wrote the whole series, understanding, number one, what the hell

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.480
am I saying? What's he talking about? Then going deeper into that, well, this person really believes

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:02.560
that. What does that say about how they move? Then I'm going all of a sudden, well, who is that in me?

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:08.560
What part of my left brain is locked into that? What part of my reptilian brain is

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:17.440
latched onto that? This other stuff is non-negotiable. Then I just live in that,

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:24.880
and I always talk like a 70s equalizer. Remember the old Marantz equalizers? You move up your 500

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:34.560
HKZ, you move up your 60, you just rebalance the equalizer. It's just going to those parts of me

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:39.040
where I'll turn up the volume, some parts of the bass, the treble on the equalizer, and turn down

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:46.480
other parts of myself. I'm not coming home tormented as Rust and Coal. Am I coming home

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:56.400
seeing torment where it should be seen? Am I reading the news differently or things coming

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:04.640
out of the news and catching my eye as being bullshit or lies or truth that it's just hard

01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:09.360
and going, yep, yeah, I'm seeing it through a different lens, but I'm seeing my own life

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:14.720
through a different lens, a lens that was opened up and an aperture that was opened up through Rust

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:21.040
and Coal. I mean, the process of being an actor and actress, I guess, is a really interesting way

01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:28.880
to be a philosopher of human nature. Yeah. I mean, it's an incredible dive into the humanities

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:41.440
and all the ologies and philosophy. And as I said, as I opened up that question,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:50.480
the being on an island is a vacation. I am also conscious for five months when I'm playing Rust

01:41:50.480 --> 01:42:03.600
and Coal that this is an interesting thing. I was as strong spiritually with my relationship with God

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.880
when I did True Detective as I've ever been.

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:10.480
Why is that?

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:19.920
Okay. Which you would say, wait a minute, in some ways, those are antonyms. No, but my,

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:28.640
pretty safely can say that my own strength of spirit in my own personal life,

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.400
Matthew's life, gave me the confidence to go further away,

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:42.400
deeper into the torture and deeper into the, but he was still always going after truth.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.200
That was the thing. He was not an evil man. I don't even know if you can call him a non-believer,

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.160
but he was always going after the truth and the truth burned and he would take the scar

01:42:52.160 --> 01:43:00.880
and get burned for it. He'd die for it. Something was actually biblical about that.

01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:09.920
And so, but I don't think it's coincidence that I had so much

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:23.520
diving into the depths of that tortured character because I trusted that when I go out,

01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:26.160
I'll come up the other side. It's always like jumping in a pool of water.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:32.000
And can you trust you'll come up the other side and not, you know, you go play a criminal,

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.600
you trust you're not going to come out the other side of Tyrant in real life. He's go,

01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:43.280
ah, God, I got to go do that. Came out and I'm still alive. Got all my faculties. I'm not in

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:49.280
jail. I'm whatever it is. And so, my own spirituality at that time definitely, I think,

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.080
gave me a certain trust and confidence to go further into the dark.

01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:00.800
It was announced that you'll be starring in a Yellowstone spin-off show.

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:08.400
What do you think about the cowboy ethos that permeates Yellowstone and other shows created

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:15.360
by Taylor Sheridan? You're a Texan. I'm a Texan. Yeah. What do you think about that philosophy

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:22.960
and way of life? I admire the simplicity of it. I mean,

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:37.360
it's one way you could explain Yellowstone and Costner's roles. What will man do to protect

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:45.200
land and family in a world that's trying to encroach, in a world where

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:59.440
there's a cowboy ethos that deems trespassing more clear earlier than other hats.

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:12.400
I admire that simplicity of right and wrong. And that the simplicity of that right and wrong

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:20.320
doesn't always correlate, coincide with the law. No, it's above the law. You mentioned something

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:23.440
earlier. I don't remember where it was in the conversation. It's a little bit of like,

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:32.240
okay, if the law ain't handling this, I am. And then it is, the law's not going to handle this.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:42.080
Therefore, I am. And then it is, I'm handling this. Law? Talk to them when you get to them.

01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:52.560
I'm handling this. There's an honesty to that. Of course, it's dangerous because it's a slippery

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.920
slope. Because of the power in that, power corrupts. It can be a slippery slope where you completely

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:07.120
disregard the law and you can hurt a lot of people. But when done right, there feels to be

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:14.720
a something really authentic and human about that. Protect family, protect land above all else.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:26.240
This is a broader question, but I'm going to piggyback it off of this.

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:35.280
CB Back to the dreams and reality,

01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:41.680
evolved species and how and what we do in creating a digital god and AI and these

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:46.640
communities and friends that challenge us and think like us, we like to hang out with.

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:55.760
Do you think we're a less evolved species than we give ourselves credit for? Do you think we

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:59.360
give ourselves credit for being more evolved than we actually are?

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:01.360
I think we do.

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.280
I do. I think we need to admit that.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:11.200
I think probably the cowboy ethos is a step towards admitting that.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:22.000
And that's why it's so appealing to people. It kind of wakes them up to realize that we're not so far

01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:36.560
from our ancestors. That the values of loyalty are really important. Trust on the basic human level.

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:39.840
How do you know if you can trust someone?

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:48.160
I don't know if I can trust someone. Well, I don't know a trick to it. I do not know a trick to it,

01:47:48.160 --> 01:48:00.080
but I do come in, as I believe you do, with high trust. I'm told that I trust too much sometimes.

01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:07.280
Have you been hurt? Have you been betrayed? And if you have, has that hurt your willingness to trust?

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:16.800
No, it hurt and I put that person and those people in another category back here.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.160
Do my best not to let them know that it bothered me at all, but I know

01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.720
when I am with those people.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:26.560
By a new person, you're still willing to trust them.

01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:31.280
No, I'm not going to do that. I think that's the beginning of cynicism, which I think is a

01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.240
horrible disease of getting older. I'm not going to do that.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:36.480
So you're fighting cynicism off as much as you can?

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:44.800
No way. No way. No way. There's no residual in it. There's no win. It's easy. It's clever.

01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:52.880
Gets the laugh at the party. And if it sleeps well, it shouldn't be.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.440
Don't get comfortable in the cynicism. I have to ask you about being a Texan.

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:06.320
You're like, when I think Texas, I think Matthew McConaughey. What's it mean to be a Texan to you?

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:13.840
I recently moved to Austin, Texas some two years in.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:17.360
All right. All right. Welcome.

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.760
What's it mean to be a Texan? Educate us.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.800
Texas is about independence.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.320
Politically, Texas is not about Republican or Democrat. It's about independence,

01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:43.440
independence of spirit, sovereignty. Texas is about exploration. One of the things I love

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:53.040
about Texas is I run into so many Texans around the world. Texans are taught to go

01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:03.760
be conservative or learn who we are, then go, go, explore, pioneer, journey,

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:10.160
and hopefully you come on back with some goods and some stories, you Texan.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:19.680
And underneath that is this kind of freedom of being an individual in the full meaning of that

01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:28.000
word. Yeah. Well, Texas is liberal on your entrance. Very liberal on your entrance.

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:37.280
Less regulation. Hey, welcome. High trust. High trust, sir. Welcome to our state. Come on in.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:48.080
Yes. Yes. Yes. But if you like cheat steel, we're conservative on our consequences.

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.800
Yeah, that's a good line. You've briefly pondered running for governor. I don't know if that's in

01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:04.400
your future. I hope it is. You had a few good lines about it. Do you think about that kind of stuff,

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:08.560
about what the future holds in terms of political office?

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:14.160
I don't think about it in terms of political office. I've graduated to a broader, larger

01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:24.080
thought of what's my future hold and where would I be most useful as a leader? I think that's a

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:32.640
fair word. Whether that's thought, whether that's the leader of my family right now.

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:40.720
It's a parent. It's a father. The leader of people that work with me.

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:55.440
Politics, I'm not going to say it's because it's not small. That's why I say that out loud.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:04.000
I do think it needs to re-engineer, redefine what its purpose is before because it's just chasing

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:11.120
its own tail right now with the two parties that seem to me to be completely about just

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:20.880
invalidation of the opposition instead of vision of themselves. I think it needs redefinition

01:52:20.880 --> 01:52:24.320
of what it is because it is important. That's what I mean. That's why I said I don't mean small.

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.880
It needs to think bigger about what it is and how it's useful.

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:35.440
When it seeks to invalidate, it's small. When it seeks vision, it can be big.

01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:39.920
Yes. Well, one's affirmative. One's going into that cynicism we were talking about,

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:50.160
and invalidation of any opposing thought or maybe that way even opposing. Opposition is an

01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:53.840
arrogant term that's too strong. A lot of times it's not even an opposition. Alternative,

01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:58.880
other than, another way of thinking about it. Oh, could both be true. Oh, how could we parlay

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:09.280
those two ideas? One of the challenges with these ideas of a third party or

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:14.720
meet you in the middle, it's kind of got this historic notion of being,

01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:21.760
oh, well, it's sort of Mr. In-between, kind of go which way the wind blows.

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.840
I think done in the right way. It doesn't have to be under a third party's name necessarily,

01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:39.200
but it's actually an incredibly rebellious position right now. I love sports.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.160
Sports, it's tactically the place with which

01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:50.800
to move most advantageously. I think of a free safety in the game of football.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.400
They're in the middle of the field and they're deep. They choose to defend left or right

01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:00.080
according to the play that's been called by the offense.

01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:06.800
Similar to the offense, the running back, you read the defense and then you're going to run

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.680
right to run left to go away from that opposition. It's a tactical spot.

01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:15.600
To be truly independent and respond.

01:54:16.960 --> 01:54:17.600
And respond.

01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:22.160
So do you think you have a role in that in political office?

01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:29.920
I don't know. It's on mind. It's not out of my mental box. I gave it real sincere thought

01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:34.000
and discernment for over a year.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.680
It's a wonderful, whether I end up in politics or not, it was a wonderful exercise. One that

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:48.880
if anyone else got time to do it, do it. To ask yourself what you would do if you were CEO

01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:55.600
of a state, CEO of a nation, CEO of the world. That's a great thing to go. You want to get your

01:54:55.600 --> 01:55:02.080
values in line? You want to admit where you lie and throw yourself some pop quizzes and what if

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:08.320
this phone call comes at 4 a.m.? Who you want to surround yourself with? It's really great

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:14.000
questions to ask and I think has helped me at a more micro level be a better father, a better man,

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.360
taking considerations that I did not maybe take in as seriously before considering it.

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.000
I don't know if that's in my future. Useful is a big word. I would have to be useful.

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:31.040
I have to be useful in the right way. And is that my lane to be most useful?

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:35.920
It's a good question for a leader to ask. How can I be useful?

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:46.160
I have to ask you about Interstellar. I think it's an incredible film. I've seen it inspire

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:52.320
so many scientists and engineers. It's just philosophy, everybody, humans. It explores

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:57.680
space travel, physics of space time, human nature, human condition, human connection.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:04.800
How has that film expanded your understanding of the universe and our place in it?

01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:16.960
Yeah. Well, it's got the old Mr. Mayor on the corner, how big is that cloud metaphor in it?

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:22.720
Because that was the character I played, Cooper's, that was the existential question for him.

01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.920
Head down, practical, stay here, be a father to my children.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:36.720
But his dream before his children were to go explore space. So when he's taking that

01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:43.040
truck out and the countdown's going down, that's the hinge of the existential question

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.120
that we all face in some form.

01:56:53.360 --> 01:57:00.960
The sense of time, I wish I think everyone loves that sense where time can run at different speeds.

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:09.040
There's an incredible scene where Cooper's a father getting video

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.240
feed from his children who've aged and he's realizing he's missed all that.

01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:33.760
Yeah. Overall, that concept makes me consider and imagine. I'm going to talk about mystical

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:40.080
successes instead of engineered ones like the engineered ones. There's ethos from that film

01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:44.560
and what Nolan put into that film and theories that make me go,

01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:56.960
yeah, what does this matter? Maybe we are. It makes me go, maybe it's already all been written.

01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.960
What's happening right now in this blip of time you're here, 53 years so far,

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:07.440
we'll see how many we get. What other parallel timelines are happening out there?

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:16.480
Is it small-minded of us to define life on other planets as only something that can live within a

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:23.200
climate that has water in this amount of O2? Those terms may be too small a thing. What do

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.400
you mean? Are we saying only life has to have water in this amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide?

01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.320
Maybe there's a whole redefinition of the ingredients that other life forms need.

01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:38.960
It sure, in a similar way to Contact, which is a movie I did with Bob Zemeckis,

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:48.800
inspires me that the universe is more active and lively and God's backyard is bigger than I thought

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:57.040
and wow, that's exciting. People go now, yeah, you believe in extraterrestrial life? I said, yes,

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:00.560
man, I think it'd be arrogant not to. I sure hope so.

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:07.120
You think there's alien civilizations all out there, intelligent ones, just far on distant stars?

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:17.760
I hope so, and I think it's possible. May have many among us right here.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:27.920
I go for the why not in that, just to keep that train of thought open to learn and consider

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.320
those existential questions. I think it'd be arrogant not to.

01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:38.880
There's so many hundreds of billions of planets just in our galaxy.

01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:39.840
Just in ours.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:48.960
I can't imagine there's not life out there, but I suspect it's very different, like you said,

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:54.480
than we are and we have to have a humility to open our eyes to how different life could be.

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.680
And if and when we cross it,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:05.280
unlike we've had tendency to do when we try to go with some nation takeovers,

02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:21.600
I think it would be our inherent glitch to go in believing that any other life form civilization

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:27.440
wants to take over territories, to go into it with thinking that, okay, this is an opposition.

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:35.040
I mean, I think that's a human trait of ours. And to consider that another life

02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:44.720
form would have an interest that more land or more territory is good for them,

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:50.960
I think is a shallow idea. I think of it more like when I think of heaven,

02:00:51.040 --> 02:01:00.720
those considerations are not in anyone's mind, heart, or intent in the heaven that I think of.

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:08.320
So in other civilizations, I hope that we would just see and learn that it would be

02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:16.160
the natural side of welcoming. It wouldn't be a primate response to, no, I have fire and you're

02:01:16.160 --> 02:01:20.160
coming over trying to put it out, or I have food and you're trying to steal my food.

02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:28.800
I think it's a shallow thought to think that, oh, it's going to be about ownership,

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:36.000
and we'd be trespassing. I don't think they would have a sense of borders as we do.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:44.080
I just hope we humans are smart enough to detect and to see aliens because of how

02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:49.280
different they are. We often have a very narrow definition of what is intelligence.

02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:54.640
It's very possible that trees are extremely intelligent if we zoom out at a different

02:01:54.640 --> 02:02:03.040
time scale. Just look at stuff from a bigger perspective that's outside of being so human

02:02:03.040 --> 02:02:08.640
centric. It's a great quote that someone told me, this astrophysicist told me this,

02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.080
how accurate it is or not. Someone else can argue the validity of what I'm about to say or not,

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:19.120
but I thought it really was a perspective grabber for me. Look, the universe was created

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:29.360
at midnight. Humans came around at 1159 and 36 seconds. I love the little analogies that

02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.800
put that frame like that make, oh, yeah, the pale blue dot. There it is, that perspective,

02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.880
something so relaxing and empowering about that at the same time and humbling

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:50.880
but confidence boosting. It allows forgiveness, it allows ambition. I just love the perspective

02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:54.160
of that picture to picture it that way in our timeline.

02:02:55.600 --> 02:03:02.320
Do you hope humans become a multi-planetary species as we're trying to do, as SpaceX is

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:08.320
pushing forward, traveling out to Mars, potentially colonizing Mars, colonizing other planets?

02:03:08.480 --> 02:03:24.000
Yeah. I love the ambition of it. I love the pioneering nature of it. I love the extension

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:34.160
of what we consider as our backyard becoming more four-dimensional like that, not at the expense of

02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:41.120
we still got stuff to take care of. We got gardens to tend right here. And sure as hell not to go,

02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:46.320
not to quit on us to go, oh, let's get out of here because this isn't really working.

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:53.200
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We got a tithe we're still supposed to pay here. That's part of this

02:03:53.200 --> 02:04:01.040
pressure testing us as a civilization and a species. Whether you call that restoration order,

02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.200
whether you call that restoration order, or whether you call that,

02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:15.760
let's figure out how to adapt the best we can. No, not at the expense of quitting here on Earth.

02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:25.200
But let a few select folks explore because that's one of the coolest things that we humans do. It

02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:34.240
embodies the human spirit, reach out into the unknown. But it's hard as interstellar shows and

02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:42.080
so on. It's painful. Yeah. Well, and Elon talks about it. It's not going to be a weekend daisy

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:48.080
trip. He's just speculating how hard it could be. Much harder in different ways that he doesn't

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:54.320
understand yet. Yeah. Well, that dance between the impossible and the inevitable,

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:58.960
that's definitely there with what SpaceX is doing, what all the folks

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:09.680
who are trying to become a multivariate species are doing. It's really hard. To build rockets

02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:18.400
that fight off gravity in a cost-effective way is really hard. SpaceX is close to being bankrupt

02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:26.160
several times. It's just hard. But it's also inspiring that some people are just crazy enough,

02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:32.960
bold enough to keep trying. Yeah. What advice would you give to young folks?

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:37.600
What advice would I give? In high school and college that are

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.440
thinking of how to make their way in this world.

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:56.800
If you haven't already, can you define what you have an innate ability for

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:05.280
and match that with what you're willing to hustle to get? Yeah. Sometimes

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:10.880
we have an innate ability, but we don't want to work for it. We take it for granted.

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:18.160
Yeah. And we end up doing something that may work. We pay the bills. It gets by day to day,

02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:24.160
but we don't really like it. We have trouble finding a way to enjoy it. Definitely don't love

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:31.520
it. And then sometimes we don't know what our innate ability is and we're hustling and working

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:40.240
our tail off and breaking a sweat to do something that we really aren't that good at on an innate

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:48.480
level. And that's a good challenge. And you can work and become good at something

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:57.360
that you don't have an innate ability for. But if you can match those two, what do you

02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:00.720
have an innate ability to do? Because we have an innate ability to do. When we do that well,

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:07.040
we do enjoy it. Yeah. And one of the things that requires is to be really honest with yourself

02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.800
at what your innate ability is. Because oftentimes there's a lot of noise when you're growing up,

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:17.200
people telling you what you're good at, not good at. Like really you have to look at yourself,

02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:23.920
listen to yourself, that inner, like a deep rigorous self-analysis of what am I actually

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:27.680
good at? Not what I hope to be good at, but what I'm actually good at. Right.

02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.520
And then if you look at that and you can define those two,

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:42.640
hopefully, you can activate it in a way where there's a demand for what you supply.

02:07:45.440 --> 02:07:52.240
You found love with Camila Alves McConaughey. What advice would you give to people on how to do

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:57.600
what advice would you give to people on how to do just that? How to find love?

02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:09.520
This wonderful subject's been discussed since the beginning of time, hasn't it? Love it.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:16.240
So I can tell you what things I've kind of learned and I'm still learning.

02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:25.040
You know, love is one of those mystical successes. It doesn't make sense.

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:45.120
You know, when I was before I met Camila, I was coming on to my late thirties. As much as I'm not

02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:53.280
a person that is guided by timelines, my life had not really added up to what I thought it was going

02:08:53.280 --> 02:08:58.960
to be relationship-wise. I thought by that time I would have met the woman I loved, got married,

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:03.600
and started a family, and that hadn't happened. And I did find myself

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.480
doing that thing I was doing at the Amazon, looking around the corner.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:16.480
Any prospective possible female I met that I was attracted to, I was like,

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.200
maybe this is the one. I make the joke, but it's true. It's like at every red light,

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.880
I'm like checking out who's next to me in the produce section at the supermarket. I'm like,

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:27.360
Joe, who's down in the produce section? You know, it's like looking.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:37.840
When you're in that zone, you can also be a little intrusive. You can trespass on people's… You can

02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:43.280
get outside of yourself. You can be overly impressed and not as involved and have your

02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:48.800
own constitution and sit back. And therefore, if you're outside of yourself, you're less attractive

02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:59.600
to your possible mate. I've got a series of dreams that I've written about, but I had one

02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:06.800
then that was very spiritual. That was me as your 88-year-old bachelor who never got married,

02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:13.440
and it was a beautiful dream. Where on paper, I thought that should be a nightmare. It wasn't.

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:23.840
What that dream did for me was it allowed me to go. You may not find the woman for you and get

02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:32.880
married and have a life with her. That may not be. And for the first time in life, I was okay with

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:45.120
that. More than intellectually, spiritually, I was like, okay. Then I'm moving through the world,

02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:50.880
and on this particular night, as myself, not intruding. I was inviting. I did see her move

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:59.680
across the room and did not say, who is that? I said, what is that? And then did move to call

02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:07.200
her across the room, so I did invite, but I was not outside of myself. And I was able to be myself

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:15.760
with her. What my eyes saw, everything that she turned out to be when the lens got zoomed in,

02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.000
more details got known, and we began to talk and got more intimate and closer together and spend

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.160
more time, became true and then some. But not every single thing that I imagined when I saw

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:32.240
her move across the room turned out to be true and then some. Just the image.

02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:45.760
We had a similar moral bottom line about life, each other, how we treat ourselves,

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:49.600
what we respect, what our own constitutions were. We had similar

02:11:49.760 --> 02:12:01.200
perspectives on raising children, which is very important to me and her. And then we just enjoyed

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:07.280
each other's company, and we laughed together, and we supported each other, and we promoted

02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:14.080
more of each other, and we lit each other's fire. And if one was rolling, we kept dishing,

02:12:14.720 --> 02:12:20.160
you go, go, go again, take the next shot, more, more, more, more. This was a biggie too.

02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:23.280
Getting excited for each other's success.

02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:34.800
Yes. Yes. To be able, I think it's very important. We all have jealousy. I get it.

02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:43.120
But it's very important to be able, if you can, be happy for your lover. When they succeed,

02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:48.640
or are succeeding, or are across the room at the party laughing with a stranger

02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.720
to be happy for them when it has nothing to do with you.

02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:02.480
I would be away, the questions and the talks we would have, she was happy for me about how excited

02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:07.200
I was about my day, and my day had nothing to do with her. She wasn't there. And I found myself

02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:12.160
not telling myself to be happy for her, but being really, really happy for her when she would tell

02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:16.000
me about something that happened that day with her. And as much as I went through my head,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.520
oh, I'd have been great if I would have been there, I was like, not only trespass on that,

02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:23.040
you had that independent of me. Bravo.

02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:29.200
That's a choice you make, not to give any time to the jealousy,

02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:31.840
to the very natural jealousy that we humans have.

02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:35.280
It sure doesn't have any, I don't see the residuals in it.

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:37.920
True.

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.480
I've got it, I've had it, and I have it. I just don't,

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.600
you know, I haven't seen where it has any payback.

02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:52.320
I gotta ask you the biggest possible question. What's the meaning of this whole thing?

02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:02.160
What's the meaning of life, Matthew McCarty? Why? Why are we here?

02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:11.120
I don't know why we're here. I prescribe to, in a religious sense, the Restoration Order,

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:17.520
the Rehabilitation Order, and religious sense, I really purchased that and love that incentive

02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:26.320
and love that view, but I don't really know why we're here. But I do know to go back to the front,

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:34.240
we are here. That part's inevitable. So now, let's flip the script and go to the why not.

02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:43.840
Just keep living. What are we doing? The base of everything, Eric, and we can argue it out,

02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:50.560
the base of it, all I can come up with is, well, just keep living, man. I mean,

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.640
what else are we supposed to do when we don't have the time to live?

02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:02.000
What else are we supposed to do when we don't have any idea what to do? When we know exactly what we want to do?

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.160
Make it matter.

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:16.880
Even when it doesn't matter, that matters. For what? I don't know. For the fun of it, that matters.

02:15:17.680 --> 02:15:23.120
Yeah, our ability to create meaning and beauty in the mundane, in the absurd, it's kind of cool.

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:30.480
And we share it with each other. We get excited and we create some pretty cool stuff along the way.

02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:40.640
I mean, I say I'm confident enough, I might be arrogant for me to say, but I do believe

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.640
that we're here to each generation have a small ascension.

02:15:47.280 --> 02:15:47.780
Yeah.

02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:53.680
Or else, what's it for?

02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:57.840
And we're not really sure what the ascension is towards, just kind of-

02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:04.560
No, no. I just think it's up. I do think it's up. I do think that

02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:10.960
it is definitely arrogant to think

02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:20.320
that we as a species or generation or people or humanity are going to reach the top of the

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:29.520
ascended staircase and go, ta-da. I think that is not only false, but I think it's full-hearted,

02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:36.080
and I think it's a recipe for having more angst and even cynicism we talked about and unrest and

02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:45.520
unrest and lack of seeing beauty and joy in this life while we're in it. I think life's a verb.

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.480
Live it as best we can. Hopefully. I mean, I don't know. Sometimes I don't have a grand plan,

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:03.520
man. I'm just trying to connect the damn dots. I'm confused, frustrated. I don't feel any gravity

02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.800
or building or lineage towards what I'm doing, and I'm just like going,

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.160
what's that Peterson line? If you don't believe in heaven, do what you can to get as far away

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:18.960
from hell as possible. Sometimes it's a great line. Sometimes I'm just trying to like, man,

02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:25.440
just don't sink the ship right now. Just keep your head above water. Maintain. Just try and hold on.

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:30.640
Hopefully, give yourself a chance to notice the magic, the mystical.

02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.040
I try to do that when it gets rough. Because it's there. I do believe it's all around us

02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:42.720
all the time. Just are we on a frequency and do we allow ourselves to receive it and see it?

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:47.680
We've got to tune the radio. Yeah. Because if we look for it too hard, we

02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:52.160
see false idols, and if we don't look at all, we become callous and miss it all.

02:17:52.480 --> 02:18:01.440
Yeah. It's a fun little life we've got. Matthew, I'm a huge fan. I think you're an incredible

02:18:01.440 --> 02:18:06.640
person. Thank you for everything you've created in this world. Thank you for being a unique

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:12.400
human that inspires millions. And thank you for talking today. I was nervous,

02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:18.800
but you made me feel at home. It was beautiful. I felt at home talking with you as well. Thanks

02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:26.240
for sharing that with me. Just two Texans. That's right. Newly moved to Austin, Texas. Here we go.

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:27.760
All right. Thank you, brother. Thank you.
