00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
The following is a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe, someone who I have been a fan

00:05.040 --> 00:10.240
of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and

00:10.240 --> 00:15.280
the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him

00:15.280 --> 00:20.440
nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.680
I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam,

00:25.680 --> 00:31.280
Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, looking to understand and celebrate

00:31.280 --> 00:36.560
the culture, the tradition, and the beauty of the people who practice these religions.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.800
I will of course not shy away from the difficult topics.

00:39.800 --> 00:46.400
I will talk both about hate and love, about war and peace.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.060
This conversation was recorded more than three weeks ago.

00:50.060 --> 00:54.040
Please allow me this time to speak on what has been on my mind.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.200
If this is not interesting to you, please skip.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.000
I totally understand.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.280
Some people asked me to say a few words on the war in Ukraine.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.800
I think my words are worth little, but perhaps let me try.

01:09.800 --> 01:13.280
I considered doing a long solo episode on this war.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.080
I tried several times, but it is too personal for now.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.640
To give you context, I've been talking to refugees, friends, loved ones, in Ukraine,

01:23.640 --> 01:30.520
in Russia, in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania, even UK, Germany, Canada, India, China, and

01:30.520 --> 01:33.680
of course the United States.

01:33.680 --> 01:40.520
Some of them crying, or angry, or confused, or scared.

01:40.520 --> 01:46.040
I'm helping as best as I can privately, and I'm hoping to help in the future by traveling

01:46.040 --> 01:53.020
to Ukraine and Russia and celebrating the humanity and the beauty of the people in this region.

01:53.020 --> 01:59.580
This was all set up both for Ukraine and Russia trips before 2022, including conversations

01:59.580 --> 02:07.820
with scientists, artists, athletes, leaders, and just, quote, regular folks who are equally

02:07.820 --> 02:10.500
if not more fascinating to me.

02:10.500 --> 02:16.340
For now, it has become much more difficult, but I'll keep trying to find a way.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.640
I was born in the Soviet Union.

02:18.640 --> 02:22.020
My roots are both Ukrainian and Russian.

02:22.020 --> 02:26.900
And today, and until the day I die, I'm an American.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.220
I'm proud of all of this.

02:29.220 --> 02:33.100
I hope to keep celebrating the culture and the incredible human beings that make up these

02:33.100 --> 02:36.300
nations and humanity as a whole.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.300
We're all one people.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.740
We're in this together.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.460
That's how I feel about the people of these nations.

02:42.460 --> 02:47.620
Now let me speak about those in the seats of power.

02:47.620 --> 02:53.860
I condemn all actions of leaders who play geopolitical games on the world stage disregarding

02:53.860 --> 02:59.220
the costs paid in human suffering on the scale of millions.

02:59.220 --> 03:05.180
For this reason, I condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

03:05.180 --> 03:11.700
And I condemn many of the military interventions by the superpowers of the world, including

03:11.700 --> 03:19.020
by my country, the country I love, the United States, that after World War II has intervened

03:19.020 --> 03:24.780
in over 40 nations, with many studies finding that the United States is culpable for an

03:24.780 --> 03:28.460
unfathomable number of civilian deaths.

03:28.460 --> 03:35.300
I condemn all heads of state who needlessly wage wars, watching young men and women burn

03:35.300 --> 03:37.660
in the fires they started.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.380
I don't understand how humans can be so cruel to each other.

03:41.380 --> 03:48.780
Or rather, I understand, but I believe in a future world where this is no longer true.

03:48.780 --> 03:53.060
Let me also say a few words of what I hope to do with this podcast.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.980
I want to explore the full complexity and beauty of human nature.

03:56.980 --> 04:00.620
I believe each of us are capable of good and evil.

04:00.620 --> 04:06.020
And I want to understand how the mind and the circumstance lead one to choose the former

04:06.020 --> 04:08.540
path or the latter.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.340
And I believe conversation is one of the best ways to work toward this understanding.

04:13.340 --> 04:18.140
For that, I think I have to not only talk to the most inspiring humans in the world,

04:18.140 --> 04:20.820
but also to the most controversial.

04:20.820 --> 04:26.940
I will speak with many people who I disagree with, politicians, activists, CEOs, heads

04:26.940 --> 04:31.140
of state, with very different opinions on the world.

04:31.180 --> 04:37.020
I will try hard to challenge their ideas without closing my mind to the depth and complexity

04:37.020 --> 04:40.940
of their perspective and their humanity.

04:40.940 --> 04:46.620
My presence in the same room with wildly different people will make it easy for the media and

04:46.620 --> 04:51.700
the internet to pick and choose clips and snapshots, attacking me for being a shill

04:51.700 --> 04:54.060
for one side or the other.

04:54.060 --> 04:59.660
I can't defend this point, except to say that I'm a shill for no one, and that I hope

04:59.660 --> 05:04.460
you see the strength of my integrity, that I won't be influenced by any of them no matter

05:04.460 --> 05:08.540
how rich, powerful, or charismatic they are.

05:08.540 --> 05:11.900
Like the poem If by Roger Kipling says,

05:11.900 --> 05:16.980
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common

05:16.980 --> 05:22.940
touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but

05:22.940 --> 05:25.620
none too much.

05:25.620 --> 05:30.940
This is a really, really important thing to me that I try to live by, that all human beings

05:30.940 --> 05:32.900
count with me the same.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.900
People have criticized me for wanting to have some of these conversations, like with Vladimir

05:36.900 --> 05:43.300
Putin and Vladimir Zelensky, and for times in the past speaking about them without the

05:43.300 --> 05:45.540
seriousness the topic deserves.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.620
For this, I would sincerely like to apologize.

05:49.620 --> 05:54.140
I'm disappointed, even ashamed, of my frequent ineloquence on these topics.

05:54.140 --> 05:57.060
I will work hard to do better.

05:57.060 --> 06:02.860
When I'm joking, it should be clear that it's a joke, and hopefully actually funny.

06:02.860 --> 06:07.260
When I'm being serious, I should speak with care and rigor.

06:07.260 --> 06:10.980
I've now done many hundreds of hours of podcast conversation.

06:10.980 --> 06:15.420
Despite my frequent failures and speaking, I hope you know where my heart is.

06:15.420 --> 06:20.180
Unfortunately, I think people will take clips of me and use them to attack me.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.860
This will happen more and more.

06:21.860 --> 06:25.500
I guess there's nothing I can do but send them my love.

06:25.500 --> 06:29.100
In the meantime, try to be a better person and a better interviewer.

06:29.740 --> 06:34.780
Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor.

06:34.780 --> 06:38.100
I like being silly and not taking myself seriously.

06:38.100 --> 06:44.180
I will keep taking risks with that, all with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity

06:44.180 --> 06:46.980
at its most absurd and most beautiful.

06:46.980 --> 06:52.540
I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of

06:52.540 --> 06:53.700
life.

06:53.700 --> 06:57.460
I will hang out, break bread, and joke with all kinds of people.

06:57.460 --> 07:01.940
I don't have to agree with them to laugh with them in order to escape for a brief moment

07:01.940 --> 07:05.460
the tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.860
Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.980
I love the Ukrainian people.

07:12.980 --> 07:15.060
I love the Russian people.

07:15.060 --> 07:21.340
And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers

07:21.340 --> 07:22.620
and Texans.

07:22.620 --> 07:23.900
I love humans.

07:23.900 --> 07:29.180
I love life, and I want to share that love with others, with you.

07:29.180 --> 07:32.060
If I mess it up, I'm really, really sorry.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.380
I'm trying my best.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.260
I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do.

07:36.260 --> 07:40.100
I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities.

07:40.100 --> 07:46.340
And I'm deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around me.

07:46.340 --> 07:47.900
Thank you for your support.

07:47.900 --> 07:53.340
For all the love you've sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.500
I love you all.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.260
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

07:57.260 --> 08:01.100
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

08:01.100 --> 08:06.060
And now, here's my conversation with David Walpy.

08:06.060 --> 08:07.740
Let's start with a big question.

08:07.740 --> 08:10.820
According to Judaism, who is God?

08:10.820 --> 08:17.900
It's difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old and encompasses

08:17.900 --> 08:23.500
so many different lands and languages and thinkers, it doesn't give a single answer

08:23.500 --> 08:25.180
to even simple questions.

08:25.180 --> 08:28.380
And to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer.

08:28.380 --> 08:33.380
Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world, it doesn't

08:33.380 --> 08:35.620
mean that it's one idea.

08:35.620 --> 08:43.060
So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, medieval philosopher,

08:43.060 --> 08:49.300
he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.620
In fact, he said, you can't say what God is, only what God is not.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.220
Because you have to emphasize, could talk more about that, but basically you have to

08:57.220 --> 09:00.820
emphasize the unknowability of God.

09:00.820 --> 09:05.020
You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos, a God

09:05.020 --> 09:12.900
of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description.

09:13.540 --> 09:19.060
If you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions.

09:19.060 --> 09:23.180
So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas.

09:23.180 --> 09:27.940
And there is this tremendous tension between transcendence and imminence.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.860
That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent.

09:33.860 --> 09:38.580
In the Talmud's words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.840
In other words, whatever you say, God hears it.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.480
And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant.

09:45.480 --> 09:50.400
Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think

09:50.400 --> 09:52.120
of it this way.

09:52.120 --> 09:56.480
When you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15-year-old.

09:56.480 --> 10:02.240
Not only did you not know, but you didn't know what you didn't know.

10:02.240 --> 10:07.080
We conceive of God as being more, the distance between God and human beings is far greater

10:07.080 --> 10:10.040
than the distance between a two-year-old and a 15-year-old.

10:10.040 --> 10:15.280
So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.200
So okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table.

10:18.200 --> 10:25.440
So one, the knowability of God, then this idea of deep feeling, which, again, can God

10:25.440 --> 10:32.120
be operating in the space of feelings too, so not just the mouth and the ear of the senses.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.440
Can God be known?

10:35.440 --> 10:44.240
Can God be felt by this three-year-old in the analogy versus the teenager?

10:44.240 --> 10:49.200
So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian.

10:49.200 --> 10:53.160
He said, God cannot be expressed, God can only be addressed.

10:53.160 --> 10:59.080
In other words, you can speak to God, you can feel a sense of God, but can you begin

10:59.080 --> 11:01.440
to comprehend or know God?

11:01.440 --> 11:02.440
No.

11:02.440 --> 11:07.760
Dave Cosby, I'm pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers, he said, to know God,

11:07.760 --> 11:09.200
I would have to be God.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.120
But can we get close?

11:12.120 --> 11:20.680
Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to

11:20.680 --> 11:24.800
the stories some kind of visualizations in our mind?

11:24.800 --> 11:31.520
For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.320
So it's almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it.

11:37.320 --> 11:43.160
This was the great, we just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf.

11:43.160 --> 11:51.800
And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because

11:51.800 --> 11:58.320
they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything is, it's not

11:58.320 --> 12:03.240
that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually what God

12:03.240 --> 12:09.960
was and along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized,

12:09.960 --> 12:16.920
which is very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even

12:16.920 --> 12:18.160
breaks them.

12:18.160 --> 12:26.120
So would you say the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility

12:26.280 --> 12:32.320
and that you're screwed, you're not able to basically know anything, almost anything?

12:32.320 --> 12:39.280
Well the reason that you're the salvation of this is that you can't, that you can't,

12:39.280 --> 12:42.280
I was going to say the reason you're not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset

12:42.280 --> 12:47.660
at a rabbi saying that, so I didn't say it and have not said it.

12:47.660 --> 12:55.240
But the reason you're not is that you don't have to have a comprehension of God.

12:55.240 --> 12:59.200
You have to have a relationship to God and those are not the same.

12:59.200 --> 13:06.600
I mean to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this

13:06.600 --> 13:10.520
one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.520
You're a mystery to yourself.

13:13.520 --> 13:17.480
You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises

13:17.480 --> 13:24.720
you because ultimately we are trapped in here and when a child first says I, we call that

13:24.840 --> 13:31.160
individuation, but what that really means is I now know that I am cut off from the minds

13:31.160 --> 13:37.440
of all other children and all other people.

13:37.440 --> 13:45.640
So you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is, you are

13:45.640 --> 13:50.440
known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can't know God

13:50.440 --> 13:52.720
just as you can't know others.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.880
And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised.

13:56.880 --> 13:57.880
Right.

13:57.880 --> 13:58.880
You don't want to know the thing.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.400
Well, the world that God created is constantly surprising.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.940
And by the way, the caveat to this, I had all these debates with Christopher Hitchens

14:06.940 --> 14:11.280
and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because it continues

14:11.280 --> 14:16.800
after your death and the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think

14:16.800 --> 14:22.340
God knows what I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.900
Can we jump to this?

14:23.900 --> 14:28.820
You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past

14:28.820 --> 14:36.180
20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher

14:36.180 --> 14:37.260
Hitchens.

14:37.260 --> 14:42.340
What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?

14:42.340 --> 14:47.580
So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable

14:47.580 --> 14:48.580
person.

14:48.580 --> 14:49.580
That was a good line about North Korea.

14:49.580 --> 14:51.340
He was full of incredibly good lines.

14:51.340 --> 14:54.460
Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens.

14:54.460 --> 14:59.780
One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready

14:59.780 --> 15:06.500
wit that you can't triumph over laughter.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.140
It doesn't matter if your argument is better, if your quip is better, you win.

15:10.140 --> 15:14.980
And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe

15:14.980 --> 15:20.100
in it and everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that's not really an argument.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.740
Or like, I have free will because I don't have a choice.

15:23.740 --> 15:24.740
Right, exactly.

15:24.740 --> 15:26.500
And people should watch your conversation with him.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.500
It's great.

15:27.500 --> 15:35.140
I mean, it's a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you're quite masterful at using

15:35.140 --> 15:37.620
charisma and sweet talking Christopher Hitchens.

15:37.620 --> 15:39.620
I also genuinely liked him.

15:39.620 --> 15:47.940
I mean, I spent a three hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another from LA

15:48.340 --> 15:52.660
to San Diego and the entire time he said, we just can't talk about religion.

15:53.380 --> 15:56.740
So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about Scotch.

15:58.980 --> 16:01.300
He was inexhaustible.

16:02.020 --> 16:06.580
I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and one,

16:06.580 --> 16:12.420
I began with the historian Keith Thomas said there are two ways of achieving immortality

16:12.980 --> 16:16.180
by doing things worth remembering or saying things worth remembering.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.620
By that standard, he did both.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.300
I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones.

16:21.300 --> 16:27.300
He knew like the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur to Beirut to LA

16:28.020 --> 16:35.620
and he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yeats and go to sleep.

16:36.580 --> 16:41.540
I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, come have a drink

16:41.540 --> 16:44.580
and I said, I'm going to have a drink before I go to debate with you.

16:45.140 --> 16:46.020
What are you crazy?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.020
And he said, just have a beer, it's water.

16:52.660 --> 16:58.740
He really was a constant inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest.

16:58.740 --> 17:02.660
What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit

17:03.220 --> 17:09.460
to have him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world?

17:12.340 --> 17:13.540
Unrelated to Scotch.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.060
Yeah, unrelated to Scotch.

17:15.060 --> 17:20.100
He convinced me that the idea...

17:21.300 --> 17:23.620
I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about it,

17:23.620 --> 17:26.180
but he convinced me through many debates, and not only he,

17:26.180 --> 17:33.460
that the idea that religion makes people better is not ipso facto wrong,

17:33.460 --> 17:38.500
but it's a much, much more complicated argument than I wished it to be.

17:39.460 --> 17:43.940
So he is, however you conceive of the term, beauty.

17:45.540 --> 17:52.500
He's one of the more beautiful humans, this weird little earth produced.

17:53.140 --> 17:59.620
So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?

18:00.180 --> 18:06.420
So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?

18:07.380 --> 18:16.100
So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently.

18:16.660 --> 18:22.020
So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality.

18:22.740 --> 18:25.060
I don't even think that he would, he wouldn't like the word religious,

18:25.060 --> 18:27.940
but I don't even think that he would take issue with that.

18:28.740 --> 18:33.460
I think that he would say his is a purely material based spirituality,

18:33.700 --> 18:39.300
but I mean his orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism,

18:39.300 --> 18:42.340
there's something deeply seeking spiritual about him.

18:44.100 --> 18:49.940
With Hitchens, I honestly, and I know that some of his fans will really not like this.

18:51.300 --> 18:55.940
It's not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all,

18:55.940 --> 19:02.020
but I almost feel as though he was less a passionate arguer against religion

19:02.820 --> 19:07.380
than he was, first of all, extremely upset by the forms that religion took in this world.

19:08.260 --> 19:15.140
And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun

19:15.140 --> 19:22.980
inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away

19:22.980 --> 19:28.180
sometimes by his own eloquence and intellectual range.

19:28.740 --> 19:32.900
So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything,

19:33.940 --> 19:39.060
I think he did that deliberately provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that obviously

19:39.060 --> 19:46.660
is indefensible, that it poisons everything. So I don't know, I think he had tremendous

19:46.660 --> 19:52.100
joie de vivre. That's really what, that's what sums him up. This guy loved life in all of its

19:52.100 --> 19:57.700
manifestations and arguing against something that someone else believed was one of his

19:57.700 --> 20:03.220
greatest joys. Yeah, and of course the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he

20:03.220 --> 20:08.580
challenged them with humor. Absolutely. And you know, you could argue perhaps that humor is the

20:08.580 --> 20:15.220
highest form of what humanity can achieve. Like sometimes maybe us little humans take things a

20:15.220 --> 20:18.740
little too seriously, then sometimes we need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves,

20:18.740 --> 20:24.100
and that's probably the purest form of wisdom. You know, Auden, the poet, said,

20:24.100 --> 20:28.660
among the people that I like or admire, I can find no common quality, but among those I love,

20:28.660 --> 20:34.340
I can. All of them make me laugh. There you have it. Speaking of people that make you laugh,

20:35.300 --> 20:41.220
Sam Harris, because he's actually has a really great sense of humor. He does. With a very cold

20:41.220 --> 20:47.700
and monotone delivery. He's another one that you had your friends with, you have good conversations

20:47.700 --> 20:56.660
with. Where's your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam? Sam believes that religion

20:56.660 --> 21:04.660
is intellectually indefensible. He really believes it, like deep in his soul. And he gets angry at

21:04.660 --> 21:13.860
the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense of logic. Yeah, so he

21:13.860 --> 21:20.660
cannot move on until this is dealt with. Nope. In fact, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein,

21:21.620 --> 21:26.500
and then Sam did one. And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe,

21:27.060 --> 21:30.500
I learned stuff about what he thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him,

21:30.500 --> 21:35.140
because I can never let him make those unfounded assertions without challenging them, and you just

21:35.140 --> 21:40.820
let them go. And I think that there was something too that was like, he finds it hard to have

21:41.780 --> 21:49.300
a conversation about religion that doesn't arouse his real ire about

21:50.020 --> 21:53.940
the harm that he thinks religion does in the world. Is this more about the implementation

21:53.940 --> 21:59.780
of religion in the world as it is versus the really fundamental? I think he also thinks it's

21:59.780 --> 22:07.220
fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable. Faith. Yeah, faith. I don't know how to put this.

22:07.780 --> 22:14.660
They're both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people that they have sitting

22:14.660 --> 22:20.100
in front of them. You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris? Yes, both of them. Okay, so you

22:20.100 --> 22:24.020
mentioned Eric Weinstein. People should listen to your conversation with Eric. He's a fascinating

22:24.020 --> 22:29.940
one. He's great. He's nonstandard. He just goes all over the place in this humor and wit. It's

22:29.940 --> 22:36.180
great. So one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you, but about Eric,

22:36.180 --> 22:44.500
about both, but Eric has a similar thing with Jordan Peterson, which is if you ask them,

22:44.500 --> 22:49.780
do they believe in God? I think they're not comfortable answering that question. Or they

22:49.780 --> 22:54.580
might say no, but they're usually just not comfortable answering that question. But there's

22:54.580 --> 23:02.980
a kind of sense that they would like to live a religious life as if God exists. I think that's

23:02.980 --> 23:07.460
exactly right. I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition.

23:08.180 --> 23:12.420
I don't know Peterson. I've read his stuff and I've reviewed his stuff and so on.

23:12.420 --> 23:22.180
But I think that Jungians are in their very approach. They believe that myth is the way

23:22.180 --> 23:29.220
the world works. And so it's not that big a leap to God, but there's still a distance there.

23:29.220 --> 23:34.260
Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too? Is it possible to have the depth

23:35.860 --> 23:41.460
of a religious life without believing in God? How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein's

23:42.740 --> 23:48.900
devout life within the tradition? I honestly think he believes in God, but doesn't believe

23:48.900 --> 23:52.900
in God. And it's oscillating like it's a quantum mechanical system of some sort.

23:53.780 --> 24:00.260
Schrodinger's God. So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said,

24:00.260 --> 24:06.420
that a Jew can be angry at God or be disbelieving of God, but is not allowed to be indifferent to

24:06.420 --> 24:13.940
God. And I think Eric's not indifferent to God. And it's different than Christianity. I've had

24:13.940 --> 24:23.380
this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts about

24:24.100 --> 24:29.940
theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion. It's a religious family. And so

24:29.940 --> 24:35.140
you're born Jewish. Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said,

24:35.140 --> 24:39.460
oh, I believe in Jesus today, and then tomorrow I didn't, I'm not Christian anymore. But if tomorrow

24:39.460 --> 24:44.580
I said, oh, I don't believe all this stuff, I'm still Jewish. So it's a more complicated

24:45.780 --> 24:52.660
system. Having said that though, I think it's very hard to sustain over generations

24:52.660 --> 24:58.820
without some belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves. And in that sense,

24:58.820 --> 25:05.860
as in many others, Eric is unique. Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith

25:06.580 --> 25:13.940
to propagate this tradition through the generations. So without that, the traditions

25:13.940 --> 25:22.340
crumble. It's a very interesting idea and very interesting argument for devout faith, which is

25:22.340 --> 25:27.460
it's a thing, it's a glue that holds a tradition together. Otherwise, like traditions fall apart.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.260
Right. So you can't have the intensity of that tradition. I mean, on the other hand,

25:32.260 --> 25:34.980
you do see traditions. I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorites.

25:36.420 --> 25:42.180
So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart. Traditions that require Turkey

25:42.180 --> 25:48.420
might not fall apart, but traditions that make demands of you that are countercultural or

25:48.420 --> 25:53.380
are hard, they fall apart. I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners

25:53.380 --> 25:59.140
that are quite demanding, getting the family together. First of all, I'm a vegetarian,

25:59.140 --> 26:05.300
so I'm tough to have a Thanksgiving dinner. But there's a comedian, Kathy Landsman,

26:05.300 --> 26:10.740
who one year I heard this on the radio and it stuck with me. She said that holidays are a chance

26:10.740 --> 26:15.460
to renew your resentments afresh. And that's basically what people do with their families.

26:15.460 --> 26:19.220
It's like, I'm going to go home and fight with the uncle again this year.

26:20.340 --> 26:26.900
I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Elie Wiesel. I recently saw a picture of Elie

26:27.460 --> 26:33.700
when he was in the camp, when he was liberated. For some reason, that hit hard.

26:36.180 --> 26:43.700
I've seen pictures in concentration camps of people I don't know or whose words I haven't

26:43.700 --> 26:49.620
really felt and gone through. But for some reason, here's just a normal person, like a normal body

26:50.340 --> 26:54.980
laying there. That was him.

26:54.980 --> 27:02.820
I've seen it. And you can see his face, but at the same time, you see that this is an amazing...

27:03.460 --> 27:07.380
I think what's so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying,

27:07.380 --> 27:13.140
is I've seen a thousand people like this, and I know this one and I know what he became. So what

27:13.140 --> 27:19.140
about all those other people who look exactly like him, who didn't make it out of the camp?

27:19.140 --> 27:25.780
Maybe it's projection, but it seemed like... This perhaps is also just combining with Man's

27:27.300 --> 27:32.980
search for meaning. It seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture. It didn't

27:32.980 --> 27:37.940
seem like... I mean, I'm not sure what I expect to see what suffering looks like, but

27:38.580 --> 27:41.300
it's almost like there's no celebration.

27:41.300 --> 27:46.740
I've never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory. It's true. It's really true.

27:47.220 --> 27:52.660
So what do you make sense? And I apologize to take a step into that moment in history.

27:54.820 --> 28:04.980
How do you make sense of the Holocaust, of Nazi Germany, that such things could be committed by

28:04.980 --> 28:15.140
human beings to each other? Is it religion? Is it the thirst for power? Is it the madness of crowds

28:15.140 --> 28:17.460
somehow carrying us forward?

28:18.420 --> 28:23.940
I mean, for me, it's multi-causal. I don't think there's one reason. One of the things especially

28:23.940 --> 28:28.340
there has to do with the special nature of antisemitism, which is, let's put that to one

28:28.340 --> 28:34.980
side for the moment. The second is, I think human beings are fundamentally split. They are mostly

28:34.980 --> 28:40.260
good, except when put under certain pressures. My first explanation for hatreds is as follows.

28:41.220 --> 28:46.500
Go to a playground. What happens when a new kid comes on the playground? Do the other kids say,

28:46.500 --> 28:51.940
oh, let's go share our toys with the new kid? No. They say, oh, who's that stranger? And let's go

28:51.940 --> 29:01.140
get them. Because otherness is built into our genetic, I mean, we're tribal by nature. And we

29:01.140 --> 29:08.500
see people form tribes all the time of different kinds. I asked you before if you were a chess

29:08.740 --> 29:14.660
player. And when I was a kid and playing in tournaments, and I didn't do it for that long

29:14.660 --> 29:19.140
and I didn't do it that well, but when I was, it was like the whole world was divided into people

29:19.140 --> 29:24.020
who could play chess and people who couldn't play chess, which is ridiculous if you think about it,

29:24.020 --> 29:29.540
as though that's the way you divide the world. But we tend to do that. And the Jews were always

29:29.540 --> 29:34.180
the identifiable other. There were Frenchmen and Jews. There were Russians and Jews. There were

29:34.180 --> 29:40.340
Germans and Jews. And the great blessing of America is that there's no identifiable other

29:40.340 --> 29:46.660
quite that way, is that there's all these minorities and no, there's not an American and

29:46.660 --> 29:54.980
a something. But once you have that identifiable other, and you have a long history of blaming

29:54.980 --> 30:00.100
that identifiable other for all the ills that befall you. Of course, people still do try to

30:00.100 --> 30:03.860
form, you said America, they still try to form other, I mean, immigrant versus

30:05.620 --> 30:10.820
been here for a generation. There's so many ways to slice it. We still try to find ways.

30:10.820 --> 30:14.740
It's just more difficult in America because there's so many sub-tribes,

30:14.740 --> 30:18.900
hierarchies of tribes and upon tribes. You're absolutely right. And I was moving fast

30:18.900 --> 30:23.780
because I didn't want to get bogged down in all the very difficult. It's true. I tried.

30:24.420 --> 30:27.380
You're hoping I wouldn't mention that tribalism happens in America.

30:28.020 --> 30:33.940
You know, some, when you're on thin ice, your safety is in your speed. So I was trying to move

30:33.940 --> 30:41.780
fast. But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in Asia, but in Eastern

30:41.780 --> 30:47.540
Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like, they're not like us. They're clearly not like us.

30:48.820 --> 30:54.660
And so, and in addition, there's a peculiar quality and I don't know, I wonder what you'll

30:54.660 --> 30:59.460
think of this explanation. There's a peculiar quality to anti-Semitism that is unlike

30:59.460 --> 31:04.180
any other hatred that I know of, which is Jews are both superhuman and subhuman.

31:05.220 --> 31:09.060
They're vermin. The Nazis thought of them as vermin and yet they control the world.

31:10.260 --> 31:15.380
And there was an English scholar named Hyman Maccabee who said, the reason that that's so

31:15.380 --> 31:22.820
is the myth that Jews killed God. They killed Jesus. And to kill a God, you have to be super

31:22.820 --> 31:28.820
humanly evil. You can't just be bad. Otherwise you can't kill a God. So there is some like

31:28.820 --> 31:36.500
supercharged evil sense that people got from that about Jews that still in here.

31:37.220 --> 31:43.140
Yeah, that's true. A lot of the way we formulate the other in terms of tribes is often they're

31:43.140 --> 31:50.580
subhuman and they're here to steal our resources, like on the playground. But to be both is a

31:50.580 --> 31:57.540
fascinating construction. Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn that all of us have the capacity

31:57.540 --> 32:02.580
for evil? A hundred percent. Runs through every human heart. I have no doubt about it.

32:03.620 --> 32:09.860
And I know as you probably do, but I probably know more both because of what I do and because

32:09.860 --> 32:15.620
I have lived a lot longer than you. I know a lot of religious leaders who people thought

32:16.420 --> 32:22.580
or think are above the human and they are emphatically not. They're not. Some of them

32:22.580 --> 32:26.660
have done horrible things and they've used their position to do horrible things.

32:27.620 --> 32:35.380
And it's because nobody, there is no perfect saint. There's no, you know, I mean, all through

32:35.380 --> 32:40.900
history, you discover all these saintly characters that we worship, the people who actually knew them

32:40.900 --> 32:45.860
around them. Some like them and some didn't. People are complicated, all of us.

32:45.860 --> 32:51.460
And the tough thing is, the thing that's the toughest for me is it's not very always clear

32:51.460 --> 32:59.780
what is good and what is evil. Because certainly if you just look at history and it's not always

32:59.780 --> 33:07.860
propaganda, I, you know, I really believe that some part of Stalin thought he was doing

33:07.860 --> 33:17.300
good legitimately. And it makes you ask a question of yourself. For those of us who

33:17.300 --> 33:21.940
want to do good in the world, am I actually doing good? And that's a really difficult question.

33:22.740 --> 33:26.500
Like in the technology sphere, for example, in this dream of creating technology,

33:26.500 --> 33:29.300
they will do some good. Am I actually doing good?

33:30.020 --> 33:35.220
So I have a question about that myself, not about Stalin. I'm sure that Stalin thought so.

33:35.220 --> 33:39.860
Stalin does not strike me from what I know of him as somebody given to a lot of self-doubt.

33:40.500 --> 33:46.340
But the question with AI to me is actually, it goes back to the God question, which is,

33:46.340 --> 33:54.580
if we have an appreciation of the limitations of our own intelligence, that we know that just like

33:54.580 --> 34:01.140
we can only hear certain things and see certain colors, how much of the world is inaccessible

34:01.620 --> 34:07.780
to us because of the way our brains are constructed? How can we possibly have any confidence

34:07.780 --> 34:13.300
that we can create things that in certain ways are far more intelligent than we are and control

34:13.300 --> 34:22.180
them the way we think is best? Seems to me a hubris that might end up being destructive.

34:22.180 --> 34:28.580
Definitely. Well, any sentence with the word hubris in it is going to end badly when implemented

34:28.660 --> 34:36.020
at scale. But there is also beauty. So if you approach it with humility, there is a sense,

34:36.020 --> 34:40.500
I don't want to over-romanticize it, but there is a legged robot right behind you, which is hilarious.

34:43.060 --> 34:50.260
So there's a magic, I don't have kids, I would love to have kids,

34:51.540 --> 34:58.260
but there's a magic to bringing robots to life that it feels like you are a mini god.

34:59.220 --> 35:04.180
Because you just breathe life into an entity that operates in this world,

35:04.180 --> 35:08.740
especially when they have legs and they move in this way that's in the case of the four-legged

35:08.740 --> 35:16.180
robot is like a dog. I don't think I'm over-romanticizing it. The feeling is like

35:16.180 --> 35:23.060
you would with a child. You just gave birth like, holy crap, this is a living thing. I wonder what

35:23.060 --> 35:28.420
he or she are thinking about. By the way, I'm not at all insensible to how remarkable it must

35:28.420 --> 35:33.940
feel to create that. I'm actually worried in part about how remarkable it feels to create that,

35:33.940 --> 35:41.460
because to maintain humility and perspective when it's such a fantastic thing is what's difficult.

35:42.660 --> 35:51.300
And I think also because creativity is both part of what it is to be human and it's very much part

35:51.300 --> 35:56.740
of the legacy of Western civilization and the legacy of having a creator god. If you have a

35:56.740 --> 36:03.700
tradition where god is known primarily through what god creates, so the first debate I ever had

36:03.700 --> 36:07.700
since we talked about humor and god and creating, let me give you my one god creating joke.

36:09.060 --> 36:13.140
Because the first debate I ever had on religion and science was with Stephen Jay Gould.

36:14.660 --> 36:19.620
It was wonderful because he had a deep interest in religion and his interest was actually not to say

36:19.620 --> 36:27.380
religion is terrible. But I started with this joke and I think it made the debate go a little

36:27.380 --> 36:32.740
bit easier. So the time has come when human beings can do everything that god can do.

36:32.740 --> 36:36.820
And a scientist looks up at heaven and says, god, look, you were great in your day and we thank you

36:36.820 --> 36:40.820
for everything you did, but now we don't need you. And god says, really, you don't need me? He says,

36:40.820 --> 36:45.300
no, we can do everything you did. God says, everything? And human being says, yeah,

36:45.300 --> 36:50.820
we can do everything. God says, okay, can you create a human being? And the scientist goes,

36:50.820 --> 36:54.660
yeah. God says, from dirt? The scientist goes, yeah. He says, okay, let me see.

36:54.660 --> 36:58.740
The scientist reaches down, scoops up some dirt and god says, get your own dirt.

37:01.620 --> 37:06.580
Yeah. But the idea is that a creator god impels us to create too. But let me bring up Nietzsche

37:07.540 --> 37:13.300
who proclaimed that god is dead. His belief in god slowly disappearing from our world,

37:13.300 --> 37:20.500
do you think? And what kind of impact does that have on society? You wrote that religion is not

37:20.500 --> 37:25.700
our enemy. Before the Western faiths captured the heart of our world, there was cruelty, carnage,

37:25.700 --> 37:30.980
and destruction. In the 20th century, when religion ceased to be a force of international politics,

37:30.980 --> 37:36.260
the scale of human slaughter was far beyond anything human beings have ever known. What

37:36.260 --> 37:41.380
is the world like when we take religion out of it? I mean, I think Nietzsche was largely right.

37:41.380 --> 37:46.900
You know, it wasn't a statement about god. It was a statement about god's presence in the world.

37:48.740 --> 37:56.820
And I think that that's largely true that god is not a force in a lot of Western society.

37:56.820 --> 38:07.540
And I believe that if the force of nihilism has no clear counter without an idea that we're all here

38:07.540 --> 38:14.980
for a purpose and that our lives are inherently meaningful and that there's a god who wishes us

38:14.980 --> 38:22.260
to be better. So I worry a lot about it. And I think that the sort of optimism that things

38:22.260 --> 38:28.900
are just going to get better and better is what one philosopher called cut flower ethics. That is,

38:28.900 --> 38:33.460
we're still living off the morals that religion gave us, but now that they're separate from the

38:33.460 --> 38:39.300
soil that gave birth to them, I see them wilting. So it's kind of optimism for the future of human

38:39.300 --> 38:46.180
civilization you think is in part grounded in a religious society. I really do believe that. I

38:46.180 --> 38:50.820
mean, it was religion that the Greeks looked back at a golden age of the past. It was the Jews who

38:50.820 --> 38:55.860
said, no, the golden age is in the future, right? It's the Messiah. And I think that that idea that

38:55.860 --> 39:03.060
we're moving towards something better, which I really believe humanity can do and absent

39:03.060 --> 39:10.340
destroying ourselves will do. I mean, I'm very excited about the technology that I won't live

39:10.340 --> 39:14.740
to see. I think it's fantastic. And that excitement is a kind of religious excitement

39:14.740 --> 39:18.580
because there's a reason to preserve this whole thing. Absolutely. Because I really think,

39:19.940 --> 39:24.340
I know this sounds absurdly anthropomorphic, but I really think God is cheering us on.

39:25.140 --> 39:32.820
I feel like this is why we're here. We're here to grow in soul and to grow each other

39:32.820 --> 39:41.860
in soul. Yeah. So what do you think the world, so if we just think of this force of nihilism

39:42.580 --> 39:52.740
that's contending with the force of faith-based optimism, what do you make of the atrocities in

39:52.740 --> 40:01.700
the 20th century? Do you think at its core it's part of human nature and has nothing to do with

40:01.700 --> 40:07.380
religion or not religion? Or do you think you can assign this kind of nihilistic view of the world?

40:07.380 --> 40:12.820
I think it has to do with a religion that doesn't make ethical demands. That is,

40:15.780 --> 40:19.540
for Stalin and for Hitler, they both had religions, but they were in a sense,

40:19.540 --> 40:24.020
but they were religions that didn't make ethical demands for the other. I mean,

40:24.020 --> 40:30.260
36 times the Torah talks about the stranger. The point is, it's trying to educate people

40:31.060 --> 40:36.180
away from their natural inclination towards distrusting and disliking the other,

40:36.180 --> 40:46.340
and it's a lot of work. That's really difficult to do. But if you have a tribal passion and not

40:46.340 --> 40:54.420
a universal ethic, then you're in trouble. Well, the Jewish tribe is a very strong tribe,

40:54.420 --> 41:00.660
so how do you make sense of this mention of the stranger versus the power of the tribe,

41:00.660 --> 41:05.220
which is the whole point, not the point, but the mechanism of tradition propagates the tribe.

41:05.220 --> 41:11.860
So it's both. I mean, the Torah does not start with Jews, it starts with Adam and Eve. That's

41:11.860 --> 41:18.100
a way of saying, yeah, this is going to be a story about a people, but understand that prior

41:18.100 --> 41:22.340
to a kind of people, there are people. I'm a human being before I'm a Jew.

41:24.340 --> 41:31.060
In fact, the Muslim New Year starts with Muhammad's journey, and the Christian

41:31.060 --> 41:34.980
New Year starts with Jesus' birth. The Jewish New Year starts with the creation of the world,

41:35.700 --> 41:41.780
because the idea is, yes, this is a particularist tradition, but it makes a universal statement,

41:41.780 --> 41:48.100
which is all of humanity are in the image of God, are children of God.

41:49.700 --> 41:58.020
I think that the idea of Judaism was to try to exemplify a certain way of making that statement

41:58.020 --> 42:03.700
over and over again. I want to say one other thing about chosenness that's very name-droppy,

42:03.700 --> 42:09.220
but when I tell you how I got there, it won't be as name-droppy. So my brother is a professor

42:09.220 --> 42:15.300
at Emory, and so is the Dalai Lama, actually teaches at Emory, although he no longer does

42:15.300 --> 42:21.060
because he's too old to go to Emory, but for many years taught at Emory. So my brother, he's the

42:21.060 --> 42:25.700
head of the ethics center at Emory, he's a bioethicist. So he brought a bunch of students

42:25.700 --> 42:30.900
to Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama. So I went to India, I was on sabbatical then anyway,

42:30.900 --> 42:35.940
I met my brother there and we had a chance to meet with the Dalai Lama. Okay, that was the name

42:35.940 --> 42:40.180
drop. So we're sitting in the, before he speaks to the students, he was speaking to us, but not

42:40.180 --> 42:43.540
because I just wanted to make it clear, not because he said, oh, I got to talk to that rabbi,

42:45.140 --> 42:51.140
I happened to glom along with my brother. We sit down, the first thing he says is he points at me

42:51.140 --> 42:58.180
and says, what's this about the chosen people anyway? By the way, he had asked that I give a

42:58.180 --> 43:04.340
lecture, which I did later to his monks about how Jews survived in the diaspora. So it's not like he

43:04.340 --> 43:08.660
doesn't know about Judaism, he knows a lot about it. But he says to me right away with, so I said,

43:08.660 --> 43:13.140
yes, Jews believe that they were chosen for a certain mission in this world. But that doesn't

43:13.140 --> 43:17.540
mean other people weren't chosen for other sorts of things. They certainly, I mean, it seems to me

43:17.540 --> 43:22.260
that other people believe they're chosen for things too. He burst out laughing and said, yeah,

43:22.260 --> 43:31.140
we also think we're chosen. So the idea is that no tribe is better than, from a Jewish perspective,

43:31.860 --> 43:37.700
you're chosen for a thing, but that doesn't make you better.

43:37.700 --> 43:43.060
No. The only place where the betters came in, honestly, historically, if I'm going to be honest,

43:43.060 --> 43:52.100
was not with the idea that you, but it was when Jews were small persecuted, the way that you take

43:52.100 --> 43:58.660
this sort of psychic revenge is by saying, no, we're better than our persecutors even. But the idea

43:59.620 --> 44:04.820
is, yeah, different people have different missions, which is, I mean, like there was

44:04.820 --> 44:09.540
a Jewish philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, who used to say, he didn't know very much about Islam.

44:09.540 --> 44:14.260
He used to say Judaism is the sun and Christianity was the rays of the sun.

44:14.260 --> 44:17.860
Like Judaism introduced the idea of God and Christianity brought it to the world.

44:18.660 --> 44:24.260
Can you speak to this difference? What is the difference and similarities between Judaism,

44:24.260 --> 44:30.180
Christianity, and Islam? The religious family part is different,

44:30.180 --> 44:36.660
and the greatest difference, which I talked about in the Eric Weinstein podcast, is that

44:38.100 --> 44:43.140
Islam and Judaism are more similar in a lot of ways than Judaism and Christianity.

44:43.940 --> 44:50.740
And the reason that that is so is Christianity in its core is not a religion of law.

44:51.700 --> 44:55.060
The reason it's not a religion of law is because it grew up in the Roman Empire,

44:55.860 --> 45:00.740
so law was taken care of. I mean, Jesus didn't have to create civil law because you had Roman law.

45:01.700 --> 45:05.700
Muhammad and Moses created a religion in the desert where there was no law,

45:05.700 --> 45:13.620
so you have to create a religion of law. Otherwise, you have anarchy. And that's why in a lot of ways,

45:13.620 --> 45:18.340
like there was never a separation of church and state in Islam or Judaism. That was a gift

45:18.740 --> 45:24.260
that Christianity gave the world, and it could do it because of render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.

45:24.260 --> 45:28.420
But when Moses came along, there was no Caesar. When Muhammad came along, there was no Caesar.

45:29.460 --> 45:37.300
Historically, the traditions shaped differently, but all three of them have this core,

45:38.020 --> 45:44.980
I think, the single most important statement and insight in all of human history, which is that

45:44.980 --> 45:50.980
every human being is in the image of God. And if you really believe that,

45:50.980 --> 45:56.740
that's a transformative belief. So that means you should love

45:57.940 --> 46:01.860
thy neighbor as yourself, which comes from Leviticus, comes straight from the Torah.

46:02.500 --> 46:07.540
So I don't know if you know, I've been chatting with Omar Suleiman. I don't know if you know who

46:07.540 --> 46:14.900
that is. He's an Imam in Dallas, great guy. I enjoy his interfaith dialogues that he engages in.

46:15.620 --> 46:19.620
And do you ever do that kind of talk with Christians, with Muslims?

46:19.620 --> 46:21.540
Yes, often, often.

46:21.540 --> 46:26.580
I mean, I do whenever I at least listen to them in the context of these kinds of conversations,

46:26.580 --> 46:34.500
there's so much love and humor and empathy and appreciation and also ability to make fun of the

46:34.500 --> 46:44.100
quirks of one's own communities. So it's not necessarily the depths or the details of the

46:44.100 --> 46:48.580
traditions, but these are communities and they're full of people and they're full of

46:49.220 --> 46:55.700
weird people because we're all weird. And so there is very particular flavors of weirdness

46:55.700 --> 47:03.300
that emerge and they can make fun of them. And in that way, they can talk about some beautiful ideas.

47:03.860 --> 47:07.940
I mean, I don't know, do you engage in these kinds of things? What would you learn from them?

47:08.900 --> 47:12.900
So one of the things I learned is exactly what you said, the personalities that you think are

47:12.900 --> 47:18.500
unique to your own community. In fact, they exist in all sorts of communities and religious

47:18.500 --> 47:23.700
communities in particular draw, I think, some interesting personalities. And also,

47:24.820 --> 47:29.860
especially as clergy, some of the pressures that you feel are shared.

47:33.300 --> 47:39.220
And it's weird, again, it has to do with that tribal association. There's almost like there's

47:39.220 --> 47:46.100
an understanding among clergy because they have similar straight and it's a strange role in the

47:46.100 --> 47:56.100
following way. It's one that you never escape. That is, you're not my lawyer at the supermarket,

47:56.100 --> 48:02.420
but you are my rabbi at the supermarket. I mean, it doesn't matter why you're there. That's not an

48:02.420 --> 48:11.620
escapable role. And every religious leader is aware of that strange assumption of

48:13.060 --> 48:15.300
stepping into something that you can never step out of.

48:16.100 --> 48:25.460
But you're also the source where people go to think about the deepest question of our lives

48:25.460 --> 48:31.700
and our universe. And so when people are suffering, they look to you for answers.

48:32.740 --> 48:38.420
Every privilege comes with a cost of one kind or another. The reason you get to be in that role is

48:38.420 --> 48:43.620
exactly because you get the privilege of being there at crucial moments in people's lives.

48:44.820 --> 48:52.580
The fact that I get to marry people and get to give eulogies for people and come to the hospital,

48:54.340 --> 49:00.100
it's inexpressible. I have this joke with people that I know that like when I'm sitting on the

49:00.100 --> 49:04.100
couch and it's Saturday night, I don't want to get up and go to a wedding. I really don't. I

49:04.100 --> 49:09.220
want to sit there and watch Netflix like everybody else. But when I'm actually doing the wedding,

49:09.780 --> 49:17.300
I always love it. Always, always, always. And the reason is that I don't think, I mean,

49:17.300 --> 49:22.260
yes, people go to you for answers in calmer conversations. Like if you asked me now,

49:22.260 --> 49:26.260
what's my theory of why God allows evil, I could give you a conversation about it.

49:26.580 --> 49:33.060
Mm-hmm. But they really go for presence and comfort, not really for answers. When someone's

49:33.060 --> 49:39.620
suffering, an answer doesn't make them unsuffer. It's just they want to know they're not alone.

49:39.620 --> 49:43.300
Yeah. To be heard and just to feel things in silence together.

49:45.540 --> 49:52.900
In terms of weddings and marriage, what's the role of that call? I need to take some notes here.

49:53.860 --> 49:57.780
The role of a rabbi? The role of marriage in human existence.

49:59.060 --> 50:05.860
It is, first of all, to teach you how to care for someone unlike you, which could be anyone you

50:05.860 --> 50:14.100
marry. And I think it's to create a home and a family. So there's a commitment to it. So

50:14.100 --> 50:19.380
care for a long time. Right. Exactly. And also when couples come to me and they say,

50:19.380 --> 50:22.980
we don't need to be married because it really won't change how we think about ourselves and

50:22.980 --> 50:26.980
our relationship, I say to them, that's true. It might not, but it will change how everyone

50:26.980 --> 50:31.940
else looks at you. And because it changes how everyone else looks at you, it changes you.

50:31.940 --> 50:35.940
Because it's one thing to say, this is my partner. It's another thing to say, this is my husband.

50:36.580 --> 50:40.980
You say this is my husband, that means we've made a real commitment to this.

50:41.620 --> 50:50.420
Do you worry that there's a dissolution of that as well, in terms of how as religion dissipates,

50:50.420 --> 50:56.580
it loosens its hold on society, it loosens its impact on society. Do you worry about that?

50:56.580 --> 51:03.620
I worry about it. I do think that it is possible that rather than a dissolution,

51:03.620 --> 51:07.620
we're going through a transition. That is different kinds of things.

51:08.100 --> 51:13.620
Transition, that is different kinds of families and different configurations of families.

51:14.580 --> 51:21.380
I see some of that, but I also do see it's less a dissolution of marriage than it is of the idea

51:21.380 --> 51:25.700
of commitment. And I'll give you a simple example. When I was growing up,

51:28.100 --> 51:33.060
a player on a sports team was always on that team. And you rooted for the team because you

51:33.060 --> 51:38.180
knew the players for 20 years. Now, there are very good reasons, starting with Kurt Flood,

51:38.820 --> 51:42.820
why people got free agency and they can move around and it's better for the players.

51:42.820 --> 51:48.260
I understand all that and I'm not saying, oh, they should continue. But

51:50.020 --> 51:57.300
just like people move jobs and they move sports teams and they change careers, they change partners.

51:58.260 --> 52:06.660
And there is a diminishment of the commitment to commitment that I actually think has serious

52:06.660 --> 52:13.060
societal consequences and that I am worried about. Yeah, there's a cost to that. I don't know what it

52:13.060 --> 52:19.060
is about commitment that's beautiful. Because some of the deepest friendships I have is when

52:19.060 --> 52:24.820
we've gone through some shit together. And so going through hard times together,

52:25.540 --> 52:33.380
especially when the hard times are between the two of you, that's always a risk. But if you can find

52:33.380 --> 52:38.180
a way through, that can bond you stronger. That's the fascinating thing about human relations.

52:38.180 --> 52:43.620
There's no question. And even if it doesn't keep you forever, you still have a connection that

52:44.980 --> 52:49.460
exists. So I can give you one. You said, what is it about commitment? I'll give you one,

52:50.180 --> 52:56.500
I think, beautiful answer. Someone once asked Rabbi Soloveitchik, who was a great thinker and

52:56.500 --> 53:01.460
leader in the Orthodox community in the 20th century. They said, you know, I go from religion

53:01.460 --> 53:08.340
to religion. I just take what I think is beautiful in it. And his answer was that you're treating

53:08.340 --> 53:13.460
religion like a nomad. He said nomads go from place to place and they eat what they want and

53:13.460 --> 53:18.100
they move on. He says, farmers stay in one place. The difference is farmers make things grow.

53:19.540 --> 53:23.140
And I think that that's true. Also, when you think about the relationships you have,

53:23.140 --> 53:26.580
things have grown out of the relationships that you've invested in,

53:26.580 --> 53:32.420
that you've farmed, basically, that can't exist in fly-by-night relationships.

53:34.980 --> 53:38.180
Can you talk about, can we talk about the Torah?

53:38.980 --> 53:39.540
Yes.

53:39.540 --> 53:43.140
What is it? And is it the literal word of God?

53:43.140 --> 53:46.420
It's easy questions.

53:46.420 --> 53:54.340
Yeah. Well, the Torah is the five books of Moses written in Hebrew. I, like most, I think,

53:54.340 --> 53:58.740
modern rabbis, non-Orthodox or non-literalist rabbis will tell you that it's a product of

53:58.740 --> 54:07.220
human beings. And I believe that they are inspired by God, but it's clear to me that it's a human

54:07.220 --> 54:12.980
product. And I think that people who study modern biblical criticism, it's really hard to study

54:15.620 --> 54:20.180
criticism, it gives a wrong impression. I would say modern scholarship on the Bible

54:20.180 --> 54:26.420
and not appreciate the fact that it even has levels of language. I mean, it's just like,

54:26.420 --> 54:35.140
if you read today, somebody writing like Shakespeare, you would say, it's like English

54:35.140 --> 54:39.060
has developed. It's different. It's not the English we speak today. And if you study the

54:39.060 --> 54:43.300
Bible and you know Hebrew well enough, you even see that this was written over hundreds and hundreds

54:43.300 --> 54:51.460
and hundreds of years. It is a holy book. And I like the idea that it is, what you say in Hebrew

54:51.460 --> 54:56.340
is torami hashamayim and not torami sinai. That is the Torah is from heaven, but it's not from

54:56.340 --> 55:03.860
Sinai. So it has its origin beyond us, but it has things in it that I think, and this is one of the

55:05.620 --> 55:11.940
things that was a huge controversy at my congregation when I started to do same-sex marriages.

55:12.980 --> 55:19.380
There are some people who try to argue that the Torah does not forbid them. Whether it does or

55:19.380 --> 55:26.180
not, it seems to me, we understand things that were not understood in the ancient world about

55:26.180 --> 55:32.260
gender and sexuality. And so- So you think that in the scripture, in the words,

55:32.420 --> 55:36.740
you can find the kind of spirit that supports the idea of gay marriage.

55:36.740 --> 55:42.500
Well, that's yes. That's my argument is that you criticize the Torah by the Torah. That is,

55:42.500 --> 55:54.020
it gives you the understanding that you use to evaluate its own claims. And I think that Judaism,

55:54.020 --> 55:57.700
by the way, has always done that because it's clear that there are things in the Torah that

55:58.660 --> 56:05.380
that the rabbis changed, altered, grew, expanded, diminished. I think that's what

56:05.380 --> 56:10.420
it is to be part of a living tradition. Yeah. You wrote in your book, Why Faith Matters,

56:12.740 --> 56:18.260
Walt Whitman wrote that in order for there to be a great books, there must be great readers.

56:18.260 --> 56:22.580
For a book to remain powerful throughout generations, it cannot have a single meaning.

56:22.660 --> 56:26.500
Scripture, like great poetry, is not reducible to other words.

56:26.500 --> 56:31.940
That is, one cannot paraphrase it and capture the totality of its meaning.

56:33.300 --> 56:39.700
So, how the heck do you capture the meaning of the words in scripture? Is it an ongoing

56:39.700 --> 56:48.260
process through the centuries? Yes, exactly so. It's a continual conversation of sages, scholars,

56:48.260 --> 56:55.380
readers, strugglers, seekers, mystics, visionaries, all of them making a contribution.

56:56.500 --> 57:04.020
I write a weekly Torah column for the Jerusalem Post. Now, what is there left to say? But every

57:04.020 --> 57:09.060
week, what I do is I start opening books and seeing what people say, and it starts to percolate,

57:09.060 --> 57:14.660
and you realize that you're entering this conversation that's been going on for thousands

57:14.660 --> 57:24.260
of years with remarkable minds and it's constantly fertile in new insights. So yes,

57:25.060 --> 57:29.620
that's what it is to be part of a tradition. Why do people keep writing love poems? We should

57:29.620 --> 57:35.700
have figured out love by this point already. I use the analogy sometimes of diet books. If

57:35.700 --> 57:40.020
any diet worked, there would be one book. There'd be one book and you'd be done.

57:40.580 --> 57:47.540
You mentioned this fascinating story that you were a part of. You were a part of several controversies

57:47.540 --> 57:54.500
in your life. I've had a few. So, for someone who walks with grace through the fire, you sure have

57:54.500 --> 58:01.860
found yourself in a lot of fires. One of them, can you tell me the story of your views on gay

58:01.860 --> 58:08.980
marriage, the underlying principles that led you to fight this battle of defending gay marriage

58:08.980 --> 58:18.660
in the Jewish community? I'm part of a congregation that is really politically split and split not

58:18.660 --> 58:25.700
only politically, but split in terms of origin. We have a lot of Jews from the Middle East, from

58:25.700 --> 58:32.900
Iran, a lot of Persian Jews, a lot of Jews from Israel, some from Mexico, from other places,

58:32.900 --> 58:38.180
and many that grew up in LA. Do you have any Russian Jews? I have a few. I have a few Russian

58:38.180 --> 58:46.980
Jews, not as many as I should, but we'll work on that. What happened was, increasingly,

58:47.940 --> 58:51.700
I became uncomfortable with people who would come to me and say,

58:53.860 --> 59:00.180
this is the only kind of person I can love. It's not the same question as an intermarriage,

59:00.180 --> 59:04.340
as a Jew marrying a non-Jew, because you could find a Jew to love. You may not have found,

59:04.340 --> 59:12.100
but you could. That's a whole separate question. I would have men in my office,

59:12.100 --> 59:17.300
primarily, a couple of women. They would say, this is the only kind of person that I can

59:17.300 --> 59:23.780
enter into an intimate relationship with. How can it be that my religion has no room for me?

59:24.660 --> 59:35.460
And that was very persuasive to me. But I knew that it was going to be explosive in my community.

59:36.900 --> 59:40.020
When, by the way, it finally happened, it was literally on the front page of the New

59:40.020 --> 59:44.740
York and the LA Times. It was that explosive. It was not a small controversy.

59:45.460 --> 59:52.900
And so what I did was, I started to teach classes. Not that many people came about

59:54.260 --> 59:59.060
homosexuality and Jewish tradition and so on. It's funny, much, much less about lesbianism.

59:59.780 --> 01:00:05.940
I'm talking about in terms of the sources and so on. It's almost always about homosexuality.

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:10.820
So, and then I got ready to send out a letter.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:20.260
And I said to my daughter, who at the time was maybe 10 or 11, now in her mid-20s,

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.820
I said, look, honey, when you go to school tomorrow, or whatever it was, I said,

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.220
people might be saying bad things about your dad, and I just want you to be prepared for that.

01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:35.140
She said, why? And I said, because I'm going to start marrying,

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.820
I'm going to start doing same-sex marriages. And she looked at me quizzically and said,

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:46.740
what took you so long? And I thought, really her face was like, I said to her,

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.740
I'm going to start marrying blonde-haired people to brown-haired people. It's like she really did

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:56.340
not understand why there was an issue. And I thought that's exactly why. Because I know

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:01.780
that this is, it's generational. People are raised with it. They have it deep in there,

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:12.020
but it's not really right. It's just not right. But if you could just look back to that journey,

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:19.620
how difficult is it to make these decisions a principle? Because you have to think about that

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:25.380
in order to think about such decisions you yet might still have to make in the future.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.340
And I will tell you one thing I did wrong with that and one thing I did right.

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:36.100
The thing I did right was I waited until in the communities where people objected to it,

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:44.340
I had enough people whose kids had come out so that I had parents of kids who'd come out

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:50.740
to refer later on other parents to so that they wouldn't feel like they were the only ones.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.140
Because once I announced it, as I thought would happen, a bunch of kids came out and said,

01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:01.220
now the rabbi said this mom, dad, I want you to know I'm gay. And when the parents came to me,

01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:05.300
I could say, well, listen, you're not alone. This person also you can go to. That I did right.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:11.140
What I did wrong was I don't think the classes were enough and I don't think enough people were

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:18.340
prepared. And I think part of the explosion was shock. And I should have prepared even more.

01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:24.980
The words you used to talk about it, the way you thought about it, was it more scholarly

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:30.580
in the Jewish tradition or did you go to the feeling?

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:36.260
No, I went to the feeling. I said kvod habriot, which means respect or honor for God's creations

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.860
and caring for other human beings and understanding.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:49.140
It wasn't scholarly because I knew that the objections were not scholarly objections.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:58.980
They were. And I had many beautiful and also painful stories as a result, some of which can

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:06.900
be told and some of which really can't. But what I tried to impress also on people was how painful

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:14.660
it is to not be able to tell the world, even your own parents, who you are. And your sexuality is

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:20.420
not a trivial part of who you are. I mean, it's core to people. So it's one of the reasons why

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:26.820
it evokes such reactions. But I would say to them, the same reason that you're reacting so strongly

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:40.740
tells you how strongly... Anyway, it was a very powerful experience. And for that, I feel good

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:44.980
about it. Afterwards, the other thing that I again said to my daughter afterwards,

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:50.020
after it all died down and after all the bad things were said, I told her the Churchill

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:55.540
once said that it's exhilarating to be shot at without result. If you go into a battle

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.260
and you make it through and you're still okay, that's good.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:00.820
The problem is when you're in the battle, you don't know.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.700
No, you don't know.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:09.380
So how did it feel like, I mean, looking back, you've been, to use the word,

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:15.300
canceled a couple of times. I guess when you're dealing with the most difficult of questions,

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:20.660
how did, just as a human being, for a community that you really deeply care about, some part of it

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.220
saying that you have failed?

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:27.780
I wasn't canceled the way... Like I didn't lose my job, didn't lose my home,

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:33.460
but I hurt people that I cared about. And that was the hard, like, I went into this,

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:40.340
to be someone who brings people together. And then I would sit there and do, even now,

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:46.820
like, as you're well aware with stuff that's going on now, I sit there and people are really

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:52.340
upset at me, who I either am or used to be close to.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:05:02.100
Do those people, in time, come around? When you look now, because those are real feelings

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:06.180
in the moment, and we can learn that about social media, people, especially during COVID,

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:13.380
there's this intensity of feeling about stuff. And have you learned something about the passing

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.940
of feeling that turns into wisdom?

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:21.380
No question about it. The sermon I gave this Saturday was about how, you know,

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:26.180
Moses came down the mountain, he saw the golden calf, and he broke the tablets.

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:30.740
If he'd sat with it for a little while, he probably wouldn't have broken the tablets.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:37.620
But the instant reaction is always anger. And in our age, unfortunately, the instant reaction

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:44.180
gets put on social media forever and ever and ever. And by the way, once you've actually said

01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:51.060
that, it becomes harder to back down. If you keep quiet for a day or two, then you can back down,

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.220
because you haven't put yourself out there. But once you've said, this is terrible what you did,

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.380
what you did, it's harder to write and say, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:09.620
Yeah, so it almost becomes, I mean, I actually, it's a really powerful statement that the downside

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:18.500
of saying something on the internet is that it actually pulls you into this current. You both

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:23.380
create the current and it pulls you into it, to where it's actually very hard to escape.

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:28.900
So when two days later you feel different, there's a momentum, there's now a tribe of people that

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.740
feel this way and there's a momentum with it. There's a momentum and also you don't want to

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:38.340
betray your own tribe, because then people will get upset at you. I really think that a lot of the

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:43.860
antagonism is not so much that you don't want to give ground to the people who oppose you,

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:46.340
it's that you don't want to break with the people who are behind you.

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.820
And that's really hard.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:54.740
Can you tell the story of this recent controversy, the sermon you just gave,

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:58.820
you went to the Super Bowl? I think a lot of people would relate to this,

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:04.500
because to me personally, I apologize to anybody who was hurt by this. The absurdity of it is

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.340
deeply intense.

01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.700
So here's the story. The LA County mandates masking children in school and all kids in

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.740
our school are masked and many of the parents are extremely upset about that.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:23.860
I will just leave that at that. I went to the Super Bowl. There were 70,000 people. Frank Luntz,

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:33.060
whom we know, wonderful guy, gave me a ticket. So I was at the Super Bowl. I maybe saw two

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.020
masks among the 70,000 people. I didn't even think about it, which was foolish on my part,

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.300
no question. I took a picture of myself unmasked at the Super Bowl.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:50.180
And many, many people thought, oh, great, wonderful, glad you're having a good time,

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:54.020
so on and so forth. I don't want to diminish at all the many people who said that.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:08:02.820
A lot of people were livid. They were livid. And what was instructive about it was they didn't say,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:07.700
nobody wrote me a private note and said, I think that this was a bad idea.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:11.700
You should have thought about this. No, they were, you're a hypocrite, you're a clown,

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:17.300
you're an idiot. How could you do this? This is a disgrace. They say that publicly.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:22.020
Oh, yeah. On my Instagram, you can still see I left the remarks up because I really thought

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:28.340
it was important. I only deleted the really vile comments because I thought that shouldn't stay

01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:34.100
up, but I left them up because I thought people should see and I should remind myself what I did

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:38.180
and I didn't want to just delete the picture as though it didn't happen because it did happen.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:44.660
And I did do it. And I felt terrible about that. And I felt terrible that I had not about,

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:49.940
I mean, the comments, believe me, weren't pleasant. I didn't like it. Nobody likes it.

01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.740
But I felt worse that I had hurt all these people that I'm close to. And I defended all these people

01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.420
who were really upset that their kids were wearing masks. And now their kid says, why does

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.620
the rabbi have to wear a mask? Well, first of all, it is tough to be

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:08.420
a rabbi. I mean, the masks to me symbolize these kinds of discussions, symbolize

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:14.580
not necessarily the issues at hand, but the intensity of feeling. And people are really

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:20.340
struggling. People are in pain. They're lonely. They're the uncertainty of it. You don't know

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.540
who to trust. Everything is under question. The institutions, even the scientific institutions,

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:30.580
and there's all these conspiracy theories flying around. You don't know who to believe. And

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.580
there's people just yelling at each other. And politics is weaved into this whole thing

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.460
in some messy way. And you're just getting, I mean, honestly, it's just like legit, simple,

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:49.700
just frustration going back to marriage of just hanging out with the kids and your wife, husband,

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:55.620
just the stress is building up over time, no release. And just people want to tell you when

01:09:55.620 --> 01:10:00.980
the rabbi is not wearing a mask, even though it's at the damn Super Bowl, maybe want to comment on

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:07.380
the Super Bowl part, which is awesome. But it released clearly a dam of all the kinds of

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:10.900
feelings that you're talking about. So how do you then write a sermon?

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:19.060
Well, so what I did was I didn't answer on social media because I knew that I wouldn't be able to

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:24.020
formulate it the way I wanted and I was going to wait and I was going to be able to give a longer,

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:29.300
the sermon is 15 minutes, not that long, but I wanted to be able to give a longer answer

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:41.140
as opposed to a tweet. And so I tried to make two points during the sermon and also I published the

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:44.980
text of it, which I never do because I never speak from a text. I always speak from either notes or

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:48.660
not even from notes, but this time I thought it was really important that I have a text out there

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:54.820
too so that people could actually look over it. And I just wanted to make two points,

01:10:54.820 --> 01:11:00.180
one of which was that I really feel terrible. And I did that all these people were hurt

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:05.860
and that there is this contradiction between the way I acted and the way they want me to act.

01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:10.420
And I also think, by the way, I didn't speak about this, but I also think that there are some

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:15.140
people who just don't like the idea of a rabbi being at the Super Bowl. It's like you're supposed

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:20.020
to be doing rabbi stuff. So I understand that too. But then-

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:28.260
But rabbi at the Super Bowl, you are also, I'd hate to say it, but there's a rock star nature

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:34.500
to you talking to Christopher Hitchens, contending with ideas, inspiring so many other minds. There's

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.580
an educational aspect to this. I appreciate that.

01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:42.980
It's making ideas cool. That's a very powerful, that is also the job of a rabbi. You're not just

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:46.820
supposed to do rabbi stuff, it's to educate yourself. Yeah, but I didn't do so much of that

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:50.500
at the game. I see.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:12:00.740
Nonetheless. But the second part of it was I said that we have to be able to express our anger and

01:12:00.740 --> 01:12:07.780
disappointment better than this. You just have to. In part because it doesn't get you the result

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:12.180
that you want. I mean, when you scream at someone, that's not going to get them to

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:22.740
realize what they did. And the most painful moment of it was this letter that I got from

01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:27.540
a Christian pastor who said, I always admired the Jews so much, I can't believe they could be so

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:34.020
cruel, and especially to a rabbi. And I thought, that's not how I want my congregation to be

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:42.340
perceived in the world. And by the way, some of them were from my congregation. Many were not

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:50.500
from my congregation. And I spoke about what you talked about, which is that I mentioned before

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:55.780
that Moses broke those tablets coming down the mountain. And the Torah doesn't say what happened

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.380
to the tablets, but the rabbis do. They say that they were carried together in the ark with the

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:04.500
second set that was intact. And that we all have brokenness, communities and individuals. We have

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:11.380
brokenness and especially now. And we have to learn how to give each other space to be mistaken and

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:17.700
broken and hurt and all of that. And the cool thing when you give people that space, you feel

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:24.020
better. I mean, you for caring for the community, it feels better when you show empathy and

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:29.060
compassion and kindness on the internet. You'll actually feel better a week from now. You'll

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:36.420
feel much worse if you make some kind of a negative statement of principle on the internet.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:43.380
It's almost just exclusively true. So if you care about feeling good, just be kind first,

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:52.580
be empathetic first. Almost always the case. Exactly. So it's, I mean, it settled down a lot.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:14:00.980
The most, really the single best reaction. There are people, and you can again, you can go on

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:06.100
social media, you can see all the criticisms and so on and so forth. But the single best reaction

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:12.500
I got was from a man who came up to me right after the sermon and said, I have four words for you.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:20.660
And I thought, oh no, I got to confess. I got to confess. I said, I said what? He said,

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:27.060
you changed my mind. And I thought, wow. And I said to him, you know, that's so,

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:32.260
it's like to take so much courage to come up to somebody and say that in front of them. And I was

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:37.620
so grateful. And the other thing that it tells me is, look, I've been the rabbi of that congregation

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:41.860
for 25 years and I taught 10 years before that. I've been a rabbi for a long time. I still,

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:46.820
I still have a lot to learn. We talked a little bit about the difference between Judaism,

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:52.260
Christianity, and Islam. Could you maybe talk about the difference between the Torah,

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.980
the Bible, and the Koran?

01:14:55.860 --> 01:15:04.020
So there's the Hebrew Bible is actually what's called a step canon. That is there are the five

01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:10.580
books of the Torah. Then there are books of history and the prophets. So books like Samuel,

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:18.500
Kings, Judges, and then the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Ezekiel, so on.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:24.980
And then there are what are called the writings. The writings are books like Psalms, Proverbs,

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:32.260
Job, the Megiloth, which are Esther, Daniel, all of those, all of those books, Ecclesiastes.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:40.100
So in Hebrew, it's called the Tanakh, Torah, Nivim, Ketuvim, the Torah, the prophets,

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:45.060
and the writings. And that is the Hebrew Bible. Sometimes that's also called the Torah, just

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.660
to be confusing, but really the Torah generally refers to the five books.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:56.180
Then there is the New Testament, which the Jews don't recognize as a sacred book. They

01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:02.100
recognize it as the book of another religion. And I sometimes say to Christians in order for

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:08.020
them to really grasp this, Jesus has as much religious significance to Judaism as Muhammad

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:13.940
has to Christianity. That is Jesus, although Jewish, became the founder of another religion.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:19.140
And for Judaism, that's not only in as much as Christians and Jews have had a lot of interactions,

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:24.340
but religiously, Jesus has no significance. Said many beautiful things, said some things

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:29.140
I don't like so much. Like what? Leave your father and mother and follow me. I don't like

01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:37.620
that as a religious model. Christians will say that I don't understand that, but that's because

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:44.180
Christians like Jews interpret their texts different ways at different times. So anyway,

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:50.740
the Koran, which I know less well, I have read it, but I know it less well than I know the New

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:58.180
Testament, and certainly less well, obviously, than I know the Hebrew Bible, is in some ways,

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:05.140
parts of it are, I don't say this word, I say this word because I can't find a better descriptive

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:11.380
word, but Muslims will not accept this. Is a takeoff on the Torah in some things. That is,

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:16.900
it's the same stories as the Torah, but they're different. Now Jews will say, and I being a Jew

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:22.500
will say this, that that's because Mohammed heard those stories from Jews and also heard Midrashim,

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:25.540
which are rabbinic interpretations of those stories, and he wrote those down.

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.820
Muslims will say, no, the Jews got it wrong, and Mohammed came along to correct the record

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:36.500
and tell the real story. But they're all telling the story of the same thing.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:43.140
The Hebrew Bible part, the Abrahamic part, they all tell the story of the same characters,

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:50.260
but tell them, obviously, Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as sacred scripture. The Muslims

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:57.780
retell many of the stories in the Bible. What is common to all of them is that all of them

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:03.700
are monotheistic faiths. Now in Christianity, that's more complicated because of the Trinity,

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:10.500
but as Christianity has developed over time, it clearly presents itself and thinks of itself,

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.740
and is a monotheistic faith as well.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:17.860
What's the role of the word in each of these religions in the scripture? So in terms of,

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:24.660
first of all, the role of oral traditions, the power of the exactness of the words

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:29.140
in the scripture, does it differ, or is it really within the communities it differs?

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:36.260
It differs because in Christianity, the words are not all the words of Jesus.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:41.940
They're the words of Jesus' disciples. None of the books of the New Testament were written

01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:48.420
by people who met Jesus in person, so they're different. And also, we don't even know sometimes

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:56.740
the original language of some of the things in the New Testament. In the Bible, and I understand

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.940
in the Koran, but I'll speak for the Hebrew Bible, the idea is that that's Lashon HaKodesh, that's

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:07.460
sacred language, and Hebrew is in its, that's the language according to the tradition that

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:12.900
God actually spoke to Moses, and therefore the exact words are infinitely interpretable and

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:20.900
meaningful. But the words are spoken but written by Moses, and the same with Muhammad, but from

01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:28.100
memory. There are different theories. I won't speak for Muhammad. You should ask. I don't want

01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:34.180
to get another religious tradition wrong. In Judaism, the words are written by Moses at God's

01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:38.900
dictation, basically. That's the traditional view. There are other views that I'm happy to go into

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:43.780
if you want to, but basically that's the traditional view. So it's pretty close. Right. What makes it

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:50.260
different, what makes Judaism and Christianity different, is Christianity has an ideal life.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:57.700
Judaism doesn't have an ideal life. Judaism has an ideal book. So the holidays of Christianity are

01:19:57.700 --> 01:20:05.380
events in the life of God, God's birth, God's death and resurrection. In Judaism, the holidays

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:11.060
are all events in the life of the people, like the liberation from slavery, or in the people's

01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:16.180
relationship to God, like Yom Kippur, which is a day of atonement. But there are no holidays in

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.180
Judaism that are events in the life of God, because in Judaism, God doesn't have a biography.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:27.060
God is eternal, and God never came to earth. And those events carry with them traditions

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:32.340
and rules that you're to follow. Yes. Let me mention on one such event in Scripture,

01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:37.220
yet another time you walked through the fire, which is with Exodus.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:42.180
Oh, that was the first. And you never forget the first.

01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:51.060
One of several controversies. Yes. You spoke 20 years ago, 21 years ago now at Passover and said

01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:57.860
that, quote, the way the Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened, if it happened

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:04.580
at all. So first of all, what is Exodus? What really happened? Exodus is the liberation of the

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:10.900
Jews from Egypt, and it is the central story of the Jewish tradition. And as I've said numerous

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:17.780
times in various places, I believe that it's based on a historical kernel. I think Richard

01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.300
Eliot Fridman may have gotten this right in his book Exodus. It may have been the Levites

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:31.780
who left Israel. But the Bible is not a book of history. I don't believe that there were

01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:38.500
10 plagues and a split sea and 600,000 men, which makes about 2 million people,

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:43.140
who actually, if there were 2 million people, would stretch all the way from Israel to

01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:51.140
Egypt alone, were liberated from Egypt. And my point in that sermon was not actually to convince

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:57.940
people that it didn't happen. My point in that sermon was to convince people that the historicity

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:02.500
of the Exodus is not the basis of the faith of the Jewish people. Well, what does the word

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.900
historicity mean? In other words, the factuality of it. It can be true without being factual.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:12.980
So you're not supposed to read it as facts? Well, I don't read it as fact. I don't read

01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:17.300
it as a history book. I said, look, I was talking again to a congregation that had many

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:21.300
Iranians. I said, you experienced the truth of the Exodus in your own life.

01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:29.380
There was a regime that wanted to destroy you, and you miraculously escaped before it did.

01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:38.420
And so a myth is something that may not have happened, but is always happening.

01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.420
And that's what I would say about the Exodus story. It's not about whether, in fact,

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:50.100
there was a killing of the firstborn. It's about does God deliver? Did God deliver the Jews in

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:57.940
ancient times? Does God deliver people in modern times? And that's what the issue is. And to me,

01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:04.500
the issue of faith is much deeper than the issue of fact. I wouldn't look to the Torah for my science

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:15.540
either. What are the limits of science in terms of what can science not tell us that the Torah

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:23.940
can in terms of wisdom? So the historicity, the facts of things, okay, if the Torah is much more

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:30.740
than that, like you said, myth is not something that happened, but something that is always

01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:37.220
happening. And so presumably, it's interacting with the environment of the day to generate

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:44.020
wisdom. So you can live a life by Torah. I don't think you can live a life by biology.

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:53.940
You can live a life that is informed by the values of the tradition of Judaism. And those values,

01:23:54.020 --> 01:24:02.500
by the way, what science does is it contributes factuality to the conversation and also changes

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:12.820
the reality around us. So when you study Talmud on your iPhone, it changes the atmosphere in

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:20.660
which you do it. But the wisdom and the life guidance and the connection to transcendence

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:27.220
is something that science doesn't give. So if we now step into returning to our

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:32.820
friend Sam Harris and step into this weird place of science, and you talked about this,

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:40.260
the current assumption of science is it's a materialistic one. So for me, obviously,

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:45.620
AI person, this whole mind thing is fascinating. Like what the heck is going on up there?

01:24:46.260 --> 01:24:52.500
So how do you explain consciousness? How do you explain free will? Do you think,

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:57.300
first of all, do you think we have a free will? And if so, what is it?

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:05.060
This is where we had the debate earlier that I mentioned with Hitchens, where I think actually

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:11.540
neither he nor the moderator understood what I was saying, which is I'm sure my inability to

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.220
express it. But he was very focused and delivered on the humor and the wit.

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:23.540
Yes. But what I was trying to say is if we're entirely biological creatures,

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:30.820
if we didn't choose our genetics and we didn't choose our environment, then there is no space

01:25:30.820 --> 01:25:35.060
for free choice. I don't understand where it comes in. And I kept asking them that question, but

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:40.100
didn't get an answer because I don't think there is an answer. I think if you're a thoroughgoing

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:46.420
materialist, free will is impossible. There could be randomness, but randomness is not free will,

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:55.380
it's randomness. I think you need a spiritual non-material belief in order to get free will.

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.460
And that's why I believe in free will. Yeah, you were talking about sort of,

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.700
yeah, and actually the moderator totally missed your point about the glass of water and basically

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:09.220
what's the difference. So to you, free will, because you could also, if it fits into the

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:14.420
materialistic picture, it could be just a convenient, useful quirk. You would understand

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:19.700
this better than I would. I don't understand how it could be a convenient quirk materialistic. I

01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:24.420
don't understand how to explain it. Well, no, if you study perception, there's all these kinds of

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:32.500
illusions. Our mind plays tricks on us to make our life easier, more efficient, and survive better,

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:38.020
and all those kinds of things. And so the feeling like we have a choice. Oh, that could be an

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:44.100
illusion. That I understand. Right, but actual free choice, free will, I don't see where you get it

01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:50.420
if you're a materialist. I think you have to have a spiritual component. By the way, I think this is

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:58.740
also, I think Sam would agree with this. I think he wrote about not having free will. And I think

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:06.500
if you don't have a God and you don't have a soul, that free will is a logical impossibility.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:12.340
For Sam, which is fascinating, it's not just that free will is an illusion, but

01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:18.260
the illusion of free will is an illusion. Meaning there's not, we don't even experience

01:27:18.260 --> 01:27:25.060
anything like it. There's no illusion. It's not even on us to be talking about it. We're just,

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:30.500
we are like the currents in the river or something. You were comparing it to the glass.

01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:34.660
We are just like that glass. So I don't know what we're going on about with this whole free will

01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:42.020
thing. I mean, to use the free will, the eye that the young person is born with, is that somehow

01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:50.340
fundamental to religion? I think it's fundamental to Judaism. I think that the idea is that

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:58.340
you are the custodian of your soul. And even though I grant that there's a certain over

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:06.820
emphasis in modern society on the individuality of the soul, that is we are more interconnected

01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:17.140
than I think we believe. Still, yeah, the eye, the idea that every human being is an image of God,

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:24.500
that I mean, that the human being in the Torah is created singly. And again, do I really believe

01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:29.220
there was an Adam and an Eve and a Garden of Eden? No, not literally. But I think that it

01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:35.860
expresses a deep truth about human life. And tied into this is the subject of experience

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:41.780
of things, which we call consciousness. I mean, this is the most fascinating and inexplicable

01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:49.460
discussion. And again, this is a discussion I've had, I have privilege to have with

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:54.820
Daniel Dennett and could not make any obvious, you can imagine any headway on my,

01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:06.260
but he was delightful and brilliant to talk to. For me, consciousness is a real thing. I don't

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:12.420
know if it is, I mean, I kind of like the panpsychist's view that there's an element

01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:19.540
of consciousness in everything, that that's constitutive of reality. But I'm not wedded

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:27.140
to it. But I think that it exists in different degrees in all sentient creatures. I think that

01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:32.180
anybody who has a pet knows that they have some kind of consciousness. Except cats.

01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:36.980
I'm not going to, since I don't have cats or dogs, I'm not going to...

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.940
This is another reason people would be outraged. I said it.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:45.060
Well, I happen to be allergic to both, but I'm very fond of animals. The thing that so

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:53.460
perplexes me about this is the denial of the reality of consciousness from people

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:59.540
who are fully aware that they're conscious. I don't know how you divest yourself of the

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:06.260
most present quality of being a person in your discussions about what it is to be a person.

01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:10.900
We just don't really have a good sense of the alternative. So you can kind of

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:15.540
divest yourself in that way. Well, maybe everything is like this. Maybe we're trying,

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:22.260
we're over dramatizing this whole thing. It seems like every living thing,

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:27.540
perhaps everything period, thinks that it's the center of the universe.

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.100
And so here we are telling ourselves these dramatic big stories about us being special

01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:38.020
and so on. And maybe we need to have a little bit more humility, both about the uncertainty

01:30:38.020 --> 01:30:41.220
and about our place in the whole. Any statement you make about something

01:30:41.220 --> 01:30:47.460
like consciousness has, I think, a sort of equal level of humility. You're saying that you know

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:53.300
we don't have it is as, not you Lex, but you person saying we don't have it is as intellectually

01:30:53.300 --> 01:31:01.540
arrogant as my saying we do. So I think for me, humility comes in in admitting that we really,

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:09.460
really have just the tiniest part of the puzzle. And as you get older, at least my experience has

01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:12.980
been not that you get more answers, but that you just see a bigger puzzle.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:19.620
So to me, there is less. So the questions are fascinating, but there's also an engineering

01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:26.980
practical question. And perhaps I'll ask you a religious one too on this point to return back

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:35.140
to robots. So how to engineer consciousness, or I'll just even ask you a very simple question,

01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:45.540
which is when you have robots that exhibit the capacity to suffer. I found myself as a human,

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:50.820
when I see that, I feel something. Exhibit the capacity to suffer,

01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:55.780
or they exhibit behaviors that evoke in you a sense that they are suffering. Those aren't the

01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:02.100
same things. From my observation perspective, they sure as heck seem similar. You think they're

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:11.220
feeling pain? I don't know. I'm observing pain. Okay. It's like when I watch a movie,

01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:15.620
and there's people on screen, some of them are dressed like Batman.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:23.860
But you can make the distinction. Like if I have a doll and I bend the doll over and it makes a

01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:31.780
sad face, I know that that doll is not actually in pain, even though I am observing pain. So the

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:40.660
question- What's that? The question is when the doll becomes able to remember things about you,

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:50.580
David, about the experiences you shared, it is able to speak and make you feel like there's an

01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:57.460
actual relationship. So that's what I'm asking is at what point do you believe that the- I know

01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:01.380
that this is an impossible question, but at what point do you believe that there is a consciousness

01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:08.420
in there as opposed to just an extraordinary- I mean, like when I play chess against a computer

01:33:09.060 --> 01:33:16.900
and it beats me, I'm embarrassed even though the computer doesn't- I don't think the computer is

01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:22.500
going out of you, idiot, but it feels that way. But there is some part of me that says,

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:27.300
okay, I know that this computer doesn't actually know who I am or care who I am. It just knows how

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:33.460
to move the pieces. So at what point do you- I mean, you're giving me instances, it speaks,

01:33:33.460 --> 01:33:37.780
it does this, it does this, but at what point does that for you cross the threshold into

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.180
it's actually a sentient being? I think the question is whether there is a threshold that

01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:46.180
could be crossed. That's one question. And I can answer this because I think it's different

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:54.660
from person to person, but the chess engine is not at all trying to cross that threshold.

01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:01.620
Let's just start there. And to me, the personalization, which is what's the difference,

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:09.220
like a friend that you meet, you've shared all these memories. The way they look at you

01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:16.260
will convey and the things they say will convey that they've shared those memories with you.

01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:22.900
They'll be able to speak in a shared humor and the language, but really the memories is the big

01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:30.020
one of having gone through things together. I think I would have more and more trouble, for example,

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:38.740
turning off a system that I've been through things with. And by turning off, I mean,

01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:46.020
delete all of its memory. If me and the toaster have gone through a bunch of dramatic events

01:34:46.020 --> 01:34:52.020
and that toaster remembers, there's a certain level to where it's just me and the toaster

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:57.300
in this together at this point. And just to talk about sentience, I don't know, but-

01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:01.300
I don't know. According to the scripture, you can't live by bread alone.

01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:10.980
But I know that there's no way to determine this, but it's still about what you feel.

01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:14.740
Yes. But isn't that what human relations are also though?

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:23.380
Yes, but it's true that I have the assumption that you feel somewhat like I do. I mean,

01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:28.900
obviously I don't, and that could be illusion and I don't know. And I know that you don't

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:37.940
feel exactly as I do. But I think we have a long, at least to me, we have a long way to go before

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:44.260
the detached part of our brains. That is the objective evaluating part, as opposed to the

01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:49.780
emotive, it feels this way part, believe that that machine has consciousness.

01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:54.660
I think it's at least without arriving at conclusions, it's at least possible that one

01:35:54.660 --> 01:36:03.220
day we will look back and realize that we have yet once again formed another tribe and that

01:36:04.180 --> 01:36:11.060
scripture all along had in it the ability for humans and robots to have a deep, meaningful

01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:17.060
connection. And that through the robot, the life that enters the body of another robot,

01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:21.860
what's the difference between a biological body and a mechanical one? And then we will see that

01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:29.540
the fundamental thing is about the, whatever you want to call it, sentience, whatever can

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:38.500
permeate an object. That was the thing all along. And then you'll get canceled one more time.

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.380
I get canceled again because I denied it. I was going to say-

01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.340
Or the opposite. You'll eventually-

01:36:42.340 --> 01:36:45.300
Oh, I see, because I'll preach to the robots.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:45.860
I'm hoping.

01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:52.180
Look, first of all, depends how quickly you do it and how much longer I have to live.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:37:01.940
I resist it tremendously, but I am also enough of a student of history to know

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:08.900
that my instinctive resistance has nothing to do with whether it will come about.

01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:13.700
I have a hard time believing it. We'll see.

01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:21.780
Can I ask you about this? Maybe you can educate me. I tend to believe that you mentioned suffering,

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:24.660
that there is a connection between consciousness and suffering.

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:31.540
That suffering is a fundamental part. The capacity to suffer is the fundamental part of being human.

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:35.940
I mean, look, when you're not conscious, you don't suffer. We've had operations where we've

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:40.020
been put under anesthetic and we're not conscious and we don't suffer during the operation. If we

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:48.820
were conscious, we would. There's a non-physical suffering that is very much tied to consciousness.

01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:56.260
I can think of things right now that will cause me suffering, like pain that I've caused or pain

01:37:56.260 --> 01:38:06.500
that other people I care about have felt or so on. I think it's equally true of joy. Joy is also a

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:12.260
product of consciousness. All tied in in some beautiful, messy way with memory and so on,

01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:16.020
that we can re-experience it when we recall the memories.

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.700
But why is there suffering? You mentioned evil. Why is there evil in the world? You can

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:26.740
tell stories about this. Why is there suffering? Why is there evil in the world

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:34.420
if there's a God that cares for us? Let's assume for a minute that everything was a primitive robot.

01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:42.260
There would be no suffering, but there would also be no growth. That implies choices.

01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:51.860
One of the things that I've said that I know why it hurts people and I don't mean it quite the way,

01:38:52.980 --> 01:39:00.260
but I will say it nonetheless, is the Holocaust presents the exact same theological question

01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:07.540
as somebody who gets shot on the streets of a city in Los Angeles, which is, God, why do you allow

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:12.980
some people to do bad things to other people? It's on an unimaginable scale, but it's the same

01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:18.820
question. The answer has to be you either allow people to have free will or you don't. You can't

01:39:18.820 --> 01:39:24.980
say, as God, I'm going to let everybody have free will, but not Nazis. Nazis don't get free will

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:31.940
because Cambodians, they can kill each other. Rwandans kill each other, but the Nazis don't

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:42.180
get to do that. That's one piece of the puzzle. What makes it unfathomable is when you're actually

01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:47.860
faced with suffering, these kinds of explanations are obscene. They just are. When somebody is

01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:52.180
actually suffering, oh, the rabbi said God gave people free will, that's just awful.

01:39:53.140 --> 01:40:00.020
There is a second piece to this also, which is that there is natural suffering, like children

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:08.420
born with diseases or earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever. Here my argument is that in some ways,

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:14.820
suffering has to be random in the world because when people say why do bad things happen to good

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:19.780
people, well, if only good things happen to good people, everybody would be good, but it would have

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:25.140
no moral content. The only way you can be good and it have moral content is say, I know that

01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:29.140
I can live a really good life and have really terrible things happen to me nonetheless.

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:38.740
It feels to me like it has to be a randomly. Now, that means, by the way, that I've been

01:40:38.740 --> 01:40:44.740
incredibly lucky. I don't have a good life because I was good. I have a good life because I was lucky

01:40:45.460 --> 01:40:50.740
and that implies not that I should feel guilty about it, but that I have a tremendous responsibility

01:40:50.740 --> 01:40:56.100
as a result to other people who aren't so lucky. Tremendous responsibility to study the lessons

01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:02.740
of history, to tell the stories of those who are less lucky and to draw enough wisdom from them so

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:08.900
that we have less cruelty and suffering in the world or have new kinds that get us to improve

01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:15.060
even more. That's right. Exactly. That we suffer better. Suffer better. For a lot of people,

01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:23.380
mortality is one of the very unfortunate versions of suffering, which is that the ride ends

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:31.060
in this realm, whatever it is. What do you think of mortality? Is it something you think about?

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:38.340
Is it something you fear? What do you think happens after we die? I don't fear it.

01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:45.140
First of all, I would say when I was in high school, I think my father actually encouraged

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:51.300
me to read this book. I read Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, which I found and still find

01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:57.860
to be one of the most profound works I've ever come across. He convinced me that a lot of what

01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:05.380
our society is about are ways that we avoid encountering our own mortality,

01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:11.220
our physicality. Among the points he makes, and I'm not quoting him at all directly,

01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:15.300
is why does everything about our physical body make us so uncomfortable? Everything that comes

01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:21.380
out of you, other than tears, is either mildly or very disgusting. Why? Why does that have to be?

01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:27.940
Why are sex and eating and all the things that are physical surrounded with so much symbolism?

01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:32.900
What are table manners, really? They're like, we're not eating like animals because we're not

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:37.620
eating like animals. Sex obviously has more symbolism around it than anything.

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:42.900
His answer is anything that reminds you that you're a physical body because that's what dies.

01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:47.620
Your body dies. It decays. It dies. It gets eaten by worms. That you don't want to think about,

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:54.260
so you deny it. I think that part of religion is a confrontation with your own mortality,

01:42:55.620 --> 01:43:00.340
but also a certain transcendence of it because the idea is something about you is eternal.

01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:06.260
What exactly I don't know? You asked, what do I think happens after we die?

01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:15.300
I don't know any better than anyone else does, but I'll say two things about it. One is

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:23.300
that every image of what it's like is foolish. Mark Twain has, I think in Letters from Earth,

01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.580
he says, we're going to lie on green fields and listen to harp music, which you wouldn't want to

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.260
do for five minutes while you're alive, but you think you'll be happy for the rest of eternity

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:35.300
doing it after you die. I don't know. This world was a surprise, so why shouldn't the next world

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:44.660
be a surprise? I have no idea. I really like this parable that's told by a guy in a book on death

01:43:44.660 --> 01:43:49.300
and mourning by a rabbi in a book on death and mourning about twins in a womb. He says,

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.780
one of them believes that there's a life outside and the other one doesn't.

01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:58.500
He says, the one who doesn't says, look, this is the only world we've ever seen,

01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:01.140
the only world we've ever known. Why do you think there's something out there?

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:03.780
He says, now imagine the one who believes is born.

01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:09.860
Back in the womb, his brother is mourning a death, but outside, everybody's celebrating a

01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:13.860
birth. He said, and that's what it's like when you die. I love that image.

01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:19.700
Yeah, the grass is always greener. It's the new step, but the eternity thing is an interesting

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:25.700
one. It's yet another concept that I feel humans are fully in equipped to comprehend.

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:30.340
Is eternity fundamental somehow to all of these discussions?

01:44:30.340 --> 01:44:33.460
I think it is. Well, partly because God is supposed to be eternal,

01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:39.460
and therefore it moves the mind in that direction, even though it is completely unfathomable.

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:46.420
Sometimes I would say eternity, you said on a green field, sometimes a moment,

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:54.740
like a truly joyful moment, feels like an eternity, the intensity of it. Maybe eternity is more about

01:44:54.820 --> 01:45:00.340
stopping time versus extending time indefinitely, and it's something that we just totally can't

01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:04.180
comprehend us silly humans. All I would say is,

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.420
the older you get, the more you're struck by the fact that time does not freeze.

01:45:13.060 --> 01:45:18.180
People will sometimes say to me, you haven't aged a day, and then I'll look at an old picture of

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:24.180
myself, and I'll say, that was very kind of you, but that's not true. It's not true.

01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:33.140
I love the idea of seeing eternity in a grain of sand was how Blake put it. I love that notion,

01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:40.580
but when you talk about life after death, I think that in some ways, my fundamental faith

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:47.460
is in human beings, that this doesn't all disappear, that there's something about people

01:45:48.180 --> 01:45:53.860
that transcends this world. You mentioned Ernest Becker in high school and denial of

01:45:53.860 --> 01:46:00.420
death. Maybe you can mention if you still see truth and wisdom in some of this idea,

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:06.820
but in general, can you go all the way back and tell some of the fascinating story of how you

01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:15.620
found faith? When I was in high school, I was a really pretty ardent atheist, and I loved Bertrand

01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:22.900
Russell, who was, for my money, with all due respect to all the very, very capable people

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:28.660
that we've talked about earlier, he's the best atheist pound for pound that there was,

01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:35.300
and a remarkably witty and lucid writer, and I was totally in his thrall. I would read every

01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:43.700
book by Russell I could get my hands on. The reason that I did, I have this theory that

01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:52.500
why do adolescent boys like Mr. Spock and like Sherlock Holmes? I think it's because

01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:57.060
when you hit puberty, for a lot of us, there's so much discomfort with our bodies that we like the

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:03.940
idea that we're just brains. I really think so. I had that experience. It's like, I want to just be

01:47:03.940 --> 01:47:08.180
a thinking machine. I don't want to be a body because my body was making me so uncomfortable.

01:47:08.180 --> 01:47:13.620
I had all these urges and inclinations that I couldn't control. Russell was perfect,

01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:20.500
and my father, who was a rabbi, did the very wise thing of buying me some of Bertrand Russell's

01:47:20.500 --> 01:47:27.700
books, which was his way of saying, I'm not afraid of him. Actually, there was another rabbi. I was

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:33.060
at summer camp, and I was sitting on the porch of the, I remember exactly, and I was reading

01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:37.300
Bertrand Russell, and this guy came up to me and said, what are you reading? I was maybe 16 or 17,

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.860
and I said, Bertrand Russell. I was spoiling for a fight, and he said, I'm glad you're reading him.

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:47.700
I said, really, why? He goes, how old are you, David? I said, whatever I was, 16, 17. He said,

01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:54.820
well, I'd rather you grow out of him than grow into him. And you know what? He was actually right

01:47:54.820 --> 01:48:02.420
because when I started to read about Russell's life, I realized that all of that rationality

01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:09.060
didn't shield him. He had an incredibly messy life, multiple marriages, endless infidelities,

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:13.860
family members he didn't speak to, he didn't speak to him. By the way, he was raised by his

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:21.060
grandparents because his parents had died, and really not a happy or, I mean, a remarkable life,

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:28.020
but not a happy one. And so I started to believe that maybe it was possible that people who had

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:37.140
faith were not just stupid and needed crutches, but saw something deeper than Russell did.

01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:44.420
And the more people that I met that were like that, it's funny because I always thought, okay,

01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:51.220
my father is a rabbi, that's great, but nobody else. And I think what happened to me was it was

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:57.140
not a logical decision to come to faith, it was a sort of opening of my heart. It's like this world

01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:05.220
is way much more than my mind can capture. And I kind of felt my way to God. And in the moments,

01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:12.180
my faith, there was a rabbi named Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav, he said he was a moon man, his faith

01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:18.580
waxed and waned. So sometimes I have more, sometimes less. But in my feelinger moments

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:26.980
is when I have more. So with your heart open, what would you say in your feelinger

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:32.740
moments is the most beautiful part about Judaism and your faith?

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:41.540
I think the most beautiful part about Judaism is that even though it is filled with humor

01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:49.140
and wit, it takes life and it takes the soul seriously. It really believes that this matters

01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:55.540
and that we matter and what we do matters. And I think that that's incredibly important,

01:49:55.540 --> 01:50:00.740
and especially in a world in which young people feel so much like they don't matter.

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:15.300
That's an unbelievably powerful message. I want to say to every young woman under 30 on TikTok,

01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:21.140
you don't matter because you're beautiful. That's not why you matter. I hope you know that.

01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:26.980
You matter because you have a soul. And to every young man who's like nihilistic and doesn't think

01:50:26.980 --> 01:50:30.820
and just thinks that if they make enough money, their life will be fine. I want to say the same

01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:37.220
thing, which is really, that's not ultimately you matter because you're in the image of God.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:42.740
And Judaism really deeply, deeply believes and preaches that. And I think that that's

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:50.820
a message that has so much to say to the world. It's like you have to take people's souls

01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:55.940
seriously. And for all of the difficulty in figuring out all these social questions and

01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:02.100
what they mean, I just don't want to dismiss people because I disagree with them politically

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:10.740
or socially or culturally because I think they matter. So ultimately Judaism has a wealth

01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:16.660
of meaning for a human mind.

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:24.820
I really believe that it does. I really do. And it's meaning, and I want to emphasize this,

01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:30.020
is not political. The deepest meaning of Judaism is not political.

01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:33.860
Well, there is, we put politics on top of everything.

01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:38.740
Exactly. But that's why I want to emphasize it. The deepest meaning is on a soul level. It's not

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.260
on a voting level.

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:44.340
Well, that combined with the humor, it's clear to me that Christopher Hitchens should have been a

01:51:44.340 --> 01:51:44.660
Jew.

01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:50.660
He was. He actually was. He discovered that in his thirties that his mother was Jewish.

01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:51.540
That's fascinating.

01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:55.460
Yep. He actually, he has a beautiful essay about it, discovering in his thirties that his mother

01:51:55.460 --> 01:52:04.820
was Jewish. Yep. So remarkably enough, he actually was Jewish. His autobiography, Hitch 22,

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:10.100
is a great read. And I just want to say like what you discover there, I don't know if I'm giving

01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:15.460
too much away by telling this story. What you discover there is that his mother ran away with

01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:21.540
a minister or a priest and they died in what seemed like was a suicide pact. And so I read it,

01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:26.020
unfortunately, after he passed away, but I would have wanted to ask him, do you think that has

01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:28.660
anything to do maybe with the hostility towards religion?

01:52:30.180 --> 01:52:31.540
We are only human.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:35.380
My father, I mean, both my parents, but my father who was a rabbi was such a wonderful,

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:41.460
warm and loving man. So I associate a religious figure with real goodness.

01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:47.940
And I'm sorry to return to a darker topic, but I really wanted to ask you this.

01:52:48.820 --> 01:52:55.700
For the current events, for a recent event, I mentioned Dallas. What lessons do you draw

01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.180
from the Dallas synagogue hostage incident?

01:52:58.500 --> 01:53:02.900
Well, the week after that, we had active shooter training in my synagogues. And one of the things

01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:11.460
I drew was that security for synagogues is important. And the second is that the reality

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:17.460
of antisemitism, which I had thought had waned when I first began my rabbinate, I thought it's

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:24.020
not going to be such a big issue. It is like an evergreen issue and Jews and all people of

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:31.380
goodwill have to take this really seriously because it has devastating consequences.

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:35.060
And if the world doesn't know that, then it just hasn't been paying attention.

01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:38.980
So there's antisemitism at a scale of human to human, but there's also,

01:53:39.940 --> 01:53:46.020
like you mentioned, politics get mixed up into things. Nations get mixed into things.

01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:49.460
Impossible to answer, but I have to ask.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:49.940
Sure.

01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:58.340
What do you think about the long running saga of Israel and Palestine? Will we ever see peace

01:53:58.340 --> 01:53:59.780
in that part of the Middle East?

01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:07.300
Well, since I'm an optimist about the human. Look, I mean, I have many, many thoughts about it.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:15.380
I'm a very, very strong supporter of Israel. And I also feel really for the plight of the

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:25.460
Palestinians. I think that this is a clash of legitimate narratives that is impossible

01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:34.900
to exactly split the difference of. However, I know that Israel has made peace with Egypt,

01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.420
has made peace with Jordan, has made peace now with other Arab nations.

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:42.660
I don't believe that Israel is unwilling to make peace.

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:50.020
And so I think that as difficult as it will be for the Palestinians to come to grips with the

01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:55.380
fact that the Jewish state is not leaving and is legitimately here, as opposed to we can't get rid

01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:03.060
of it now, but we will get rid of it one day. If that comes to be, and I believe that it will,

01:55:03.060 --> 01:55:07.860
I think not only that there would be peace, but I think that those two peoples together could

01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:09.860
probably do remarkable things in the world.

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:21.300
Do you think the source of it is politics? Is it religious ideas? And to flip it, what is the way

01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:35.620
out? Is it geopolitics? Is it interfaith discourse and collaboration, or is it simply the human love?

01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:42.500
Like love. So I'm not sure that I could give one answer to that, but I will give a piece of an

01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:49.780
answer. Why did the Abraham Accords happen? The main reason that they happened was because economics

01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:56.100
overrode ideology. And I actually am hopeful that that's in the end what will happen,

01:55:56.900 --> 01:56:03.540
that people will say, you know what, we could have such a better life if we put aside the

01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:10.340
ideological animosities and just created this different kind of Middle East together.

01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:17.140
I went to Dubai to watch the World Chess Championship because I really wanted to see

01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:22.340
Magnus Carlsen play. I thought you're alive when you have such a remarkable world champion,

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:27.780
go see him play. So I actually took myself to Dubai for the last couple of games and I watched.

01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:33.780
And so I wasn't so much, I mean, it's not that I'm uninterested in Dubai, but I went there for the

01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:38.900
chess thing. The expo was also on at the same time and I saw here's this amazing place. I came back.

01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:42.100
This guy I know who lived in Dubai for several years and works in the Middle East said to me,

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:48.820
what did you think of it? And I said, it was nice. Dubai, it was very polished, very sophisticated,

01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:55.380
very clean, no crime and so on. But it was like Las Vegas in the Middle East without the gambling

01:56:55.380 --> 01:57:01.060
or something like that. And he totally changed my perspective in a couple of sentences. He said,

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:06.260
I know it seems like that when you come from Los Angeles. He said, but fly there from Yemen

01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:11.380
or from Riyadh and it is a miracle. And I thought, oh my God, you're right.

01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:20.500
It's like what human beings can do if they just put aside their ideological shackles is remarkable

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.980
and I'm hopeful that one day that'll happen.

01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:29.380
Economics allows for higher quality of life. You no longer, it's the playground analogy you said

01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:36.740
earlier. If there's more resources to play with, unfortunately us humans are more willing to play

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:42.500
with others. And maybe that is the solution. And maybe, I mean, for me from a technology perspective,

01:57:43.220 --> 01:57:52.580
innovation, engineering helps make everybody's life better. And over that, once people's lives

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:58.180
become better, they start to have more time to be empathetic and hear people.

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:03.300
And they have more to lose. When you have more to lose, it actually makes you, I think,

01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:10.020
countries are less willing to go to war when they have more to lose. And families want peace when

01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:14.660
it's good at home. So I think there's an element of that as well.

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:19.540
And some of it, again, taking us back to the other aspect of our conversation is how we're

01:58:19.540 --> 01:58:26.260
conducting ourselves in conversation online and so on. Because I think actually I'm a big fan of

01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:33.140
the idea of social media that is a way for us to connect together. I think there's a lot of

01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:40.180
really strong ideas how to do that well. And clearly the initial attempts that kind of just

01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:46.180
open it up wide, some of the lesser aspects of human nature can take over

01:58:47.140 --> 01:58:51.300
when combined with different forces like advertisements and virality and all those

01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:58.180
kinds of things. But overall, I love the honesty of the mess of it being presented before us on

01:58:58.180 --> 01:59:06.340
social media. Part of me, maybe because I don't participate, if somebody is being mean to me or

01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:13.860
being aggressive and these kinds of things, I enjoy it because it's human nature. But I enjoy

01:59:13.860 --> 01:59:18.420
it because I don't respond. I think if I responded, I would get pulled into this human nature and then

01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:24.900
it's not fun. But I love the, I'll talk to people. In fact, I still visit Clubhouse. I don't know if

01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:30.900
you know what that is. I think that's how we first met. Well, yeah. Well, I was such a fanboy

01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:39.060
actually when I first heard you and I was like, I can't believe it. But the Israel-Palestine

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:48.900
topic was something that was very deeply in a heated way discussed on Clubhouse. Race

01:59:48.900 --> 01:59:54.260
relations is a thing that was really heatedly discussed. And I now go to Clubhouse to practice

01:59:54.260 --> 02:00:03.140
Russian. And there in Russian, the heated discussion is on basically any topic as meaningless

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:10.100
or meaningful as you want. And the heat of it, just people just screaming and then calming down

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:14.820
and going through the full process. That too is beautiful because that emotion is there.

02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:22.420
And if it is allowed to have a voice, I think ultimately it leads to healing. So that felt

02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:29.300
really healthy to learn how to do that at scale. Social media, I wish that it were not as

02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:35.700
algorithmically biased towards conflict. I don't think that that's healthy, but I do. I think it

02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:42.660
brings a lot of blessings into people's lives if they use it wisely. Like anything else, it can be

02:00:43.460 --> 02:00:49.780
awful, but it can't. I've connected to all sorts of people that I never would have known

02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:57.860
and that's been wonderful. Let me ask you the big question of advice. What advice would you

02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:05.060
give to young people today that are maybe high school, college, thinking about career,

02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:10.580
thinking about life they can be proud of. So the first thing that I would say is that life

02:01:10.580 --> 02:01:16.180
is longer than you think it is. Even though I understand the impulse to be in a rush,

02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:24.180
you will have many unfoldings, more even than people of my generation did.

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:27.460
Unfoldings, that's such a funny word. That's a beautiful word.

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:31.300
But it feels that way. It's like different aspects of your life will come,

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.980
will show you different possibilities that you don't imagine at the moment.

02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:42.980
And I think the second thing that I would say is

02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:54.100
I know that this is a very old fashioned, but I would say to the extent that you can read,

02:01:54.100 --> 02:02:00.340
don't just, and not just on social media, read books. Learn things that will give you a broader

02:02:00.340 --> 02:02:11.300
context for your life than just today or yesterday or the day before. And I suppose the other thing

02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:25.220
that I would say is that to the extent that you can, try to develop your own internal metric

02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:33.220
of both what matters and what is good, because you will be exposed to more voices than any

02:02:33.220 --> 02:02:38.580
generation in history telling you that that's good or this is good. They're called influences,

02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:43.060
but what they are is voices telling you what you should think and what you should believe.

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:50.820
And so have some internal space where you'll be able to say, for example,

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:53.380
I know this person is doing that and it looks great, but that's not me.

02:02:54.580 --> 02:03:01.060
You have a community of people that speak to you with a lot of passion,

02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:10.020
and do you still have that voice in your own, in the privacy of your own mind that you're able to

02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:15.700
ignore? For a moment, just be with yourself and think what is right.

02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:19.460
Absolutely. And I think it's partly because I grew up without that. I mean,

02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:25.300
I grew up with a lot of space in my life and so I had a chance to develop that voice. That's why

02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:30.180
I think it's harder for kids today than it was for me. I grew up when there were three channels,

02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:35.620
there was three, six, and ten. There was ABC, CBS, and NBC, and that was it. And you spent your

02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:40.500
evening playing board games or reading or whatever and there was a lot of space. And we played

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:44.900
football on the street and you went on your bike in the morning and nobody worried about you and

02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:53.700
you came home at night and everybody assumed you were fine. And also I went into a religious

02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:59.060
tradition where I feel like I have the opportunity to judge myself by bigger metrics.

02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:07.620
And it's still hard. It's not like, oh, I wear impenetrable armor. It's still hard. So

02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:11.300
how much harder for kids today when they don't have that?

02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:20.340
You mentioned books. Is there Bertrand Russell and Denial of Death by Ernest Becker? Is there

02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:24.980
books that pop into mind that had an impact on you?

02:04:24.980 --> 02:04:32.100
My favorite novel is Middlemarch. I remember I was listening to a podcast. I was listening

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:36.740
to one of your podcasts where your guest said the two greatest novels of the 19th century

02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:43.300
were Brothers Karamazov and what was the other one he mentioned? I don't remember.

02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:46.500
Dostoevsky as well or no? Was it both Dostoevsky?

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:51.300
It might have been. I don't remember. But anyway, I would say Middlemarch is up there.

02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.220
Middlemarch presents an entire world and it's written by a woman, Mary Ann Evans,

02:04:57.220 --> 02:05:04.900
who took the pen name George Eliot. Virginia Woolf said it's the only English novel written

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:10.900
for grownups. You feel the genius in her sentences, like the pressure of her intellect

02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:15.060
in her sentences. It's a wonderful, wonderful book. I love it.

02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:16.660
Pressure of her intellect.

02:05:16.660 --> 02:05:24.740
Yeah, you really do. I love Saul Bellow, especially Herzog, but it's a very different

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:30.980
of thinking person's novel. I read a lot of mysteries and a lot of other kinds of

02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:37.940
fiction and literature, but in terms of the books that most... You mentioned one of them,

02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:45.940
which is Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. I also really, really love Heschel's The Sabbath.

02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:50.820
I think it's a beautiful book. It's a very short book, just as Frankl's book is.

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:56.660
What do you take from the Man's Search for Meaning? What do you take of a human being

02:05:56.660 --> 02:06:08.420
in the worst conditions, being able to non-dramatically find little joys, find beauty?

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:15.540
It's what I said before about Judaism's advice to younger people, is that it matters. If you

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:21.860
believe that something matters, you have enormous resilience. It's meaninglessness that is the

02:06:21.860 --> 02:06:28.580
greatest threat to a decent life. When people are deeply depressed, whether it is chemical depression

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:36.100
or what they feel like is this is all meaningless. Now, obviously,

02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:44.660
chemical depression calls in part for chemical means, but meaning is the great antidote.

02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:51.860
We can talk about what kind of meaning. There are kinds of meanings that are awful, but meaning is

02:06:51.860 --> 02:07:00.340
the great antidote to a sense that life is just nihilistic and purposeless and to that destructiveness

02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:11.380
that I think is too common. Maybe the heroic action in Nazi Germany, in the holocaust,

02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:17.700
in the camps is even not the action, but just the realization that every life matters.

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:24.820
Here's this really wonderful story that Hugo Grin, who was a rabbi in England,

02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:30.340
I don't know, 15, 20 years ago, used to tell, he grew up in Auschwitz. He was a child there,

02:07:30.340 --> 02:07:35.780
and he was with his father, and it was Chanukah. You're supposed to light the candles. His father

02:07:35.780 --> 02:07:41.700
took the margarine ration and used it as the oil to light the Chanukah candles. Hugo was scandalized,

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:47.220
and he said, that's our food. His father said, what we have learned, my son, is you can live

02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:53.060
for three weeks without food. You can live for three days without water, but you can't live for

02:07:53.060 --> 02:08:04.420
three minutes without hope. Well, hope, let me ask you, he said meaning. What's the meaning

02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:09.300
of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life? You're the perfect person to ask this question.

02:08:11.540 --> 02:08:16.580
I believe the meaning of life is for human beings to grow in soul. That's why we're here,

02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:21.700
and you can do that in infinite numbers of ways, but if you're supposed to return your soul like

02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:28.100
more burnished and beautiful, then you got it. It's going to have some nicks and cuts,

02:08:29.940 --> 02:08:38.580
but that's what it means to deepen and grow it. You do that more than anything else. You do that

02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:43.140
by learning how to love. That's the principal way, I think, that you do it.

02:08:43.140 --> 02:08:46.900
It's interesting because for a human, the relationship,

02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:52.500
if you're a man of faith, is with God, but it feels like love is so

02:08:54.340 --> 02:09:00.980
richly part of human society that it's not just love of God, it's love of each other.

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:07.540
No, right. Yep. There's no question about the idea. In Judaism, that was actually the great

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:12.340
innovation of the monotheistic idea. In pagan societies, it was all about how you treat the

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:21.620
gods. Monotheism said, no, God cares how you treat each other. In fact, the mystics used the same

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:28.500
kind of word in Hebrew, dveikut, which means clinging, that is used about Adam and Eve.

02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:34.100
It says, therefore, a man will leave his father and mother and davach with his wife,

02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:39.140
and davach means cling. There is an analogy there, absolutely.

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:45.060
Yeah, I think of human civilization as that movie, March of the Penguins,

02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:50.260
and they're all huddling together in the cold. This is fundamentally human. There's this

02:09:52.740 --> 02:10:00.900
darkness all around us of uncertainty, of cruelty. It seems like everything is so fragile,

02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:08.100
and we're just all huddling together for warmth, and that's all we got is each other.

02:10:09.460 --> 02:10:14.420
We started with the big question of what is God, ended with what is meaning.

02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:20.980
Rabbi Wolpe, I've been, as I've told you, a huge, huge fan of yours for a long time. It's such an

02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:25.460
honor that you talked to me today. I am really so happy to be here, and thank you so much for the

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:30.660
conversation. Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Wolpe. To support this

02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:35.540
podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. Now, let me leave you with some

02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:42.980
words from David himself. The only whole heart is a broken one because it lets the light in.

02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:46.980
Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
