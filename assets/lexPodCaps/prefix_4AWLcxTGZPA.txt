00:00.000 --> 00:03.520
The following is a conversation with Ye, the legendary artist,

00:03.520 --> 00:08.160
producer and designer formerly known as Kanye West on this,

00:08.400 --> 00:10.120
the Lex Fridman podcast.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.800
Based off of our connection and just you being a friend,

00:15.200 --> 00:20.040
I need to show you my two tech companies and get your

00:20.040 --> 00:23.560
perspective on it. Because now I have friends that can give a perspective.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.160
Like when I would work on albums,

00:25.160 --> 00:27.720
I had other friends that worked on albums and they would give me their

00:27.720 --> 00:28.560
perspectives on it.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.520
You want to do this?

00:30.080 --> 00:31.400
We are doing it. This is part of it.

00:31.400 --> 00:34.240
This is part of it. Absolutely. All right. Beautiful. Oh,

00:34.240 --> 00:36.480
what I wanted to finish the thing is, okay,

00:36.480 --> 00:37.880
you're going to ask me different questions,

00:38.200 --> 00:42.000
but I'm about growing and building and bringing the idea to life.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.840
So when I see you, I say, Oh,

00:43.840 --> 00:48.680
this guy understands how to hire engineers where I'm coming

00:48.680 --> 00:52.360
from, coming from Hollywood, coming from press, coming from media,

00:52.920 --> 00:57.520
all of the guys, you know, that so many of the guys that have been like voices

00:57.520 --> 00:59.760
and faces and talking heads, whatever,

01:00.280 --> 01:03.800
have not understood how to engineer product.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.480
And that's the reason why I was able to jump past everyone in the entertainment

01:07.480 --> 01:11.920
field and become, you know, whatever the net worth is, 11 billion.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.960
I'm going to stop putting the whole black thing on my worth.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.440
Like, let's just see where I am on the scale of life,

01:18.440 --> 01:22.680
because that's a cop out for me to say Rich is Black Guy of all time,

01:22.680 --> 01:26.000
because that's feeding into the same, you know,

01:26.080 --> 01:29.360
trauma economy that Black Lives Matter feeds into.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.880
That's why I love and respect engineers.

01:32.400 --> 01:37.200
That's the only thing that we really need to teach in school is engineering.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.600
We don't need to teach history.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.800
We don't need to teach anything that is subjective.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.960
It needs to only be engineering taught in school

01:47.320 --> 01:49.800
and everything else needs to be recessed.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.040
Nothing at all.

01:51.040 --> 01:55.000
Any force, subjective information is just to weaken

01:55.000 --> 01:57.840
and indoctrinate our species.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.720
And that's what schools do now.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.880
As an engineer, I love hearing you say that.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.600
But to push back, history is not

02:05.440 --> 02:09.040
the interpretation of history might be subjective, but history has some facts

02:09.320 --> 02:12.920
and they're useful to give a grounding to the way you do engineering.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.080
I don't 100% believe in anything,

02:16.320 --> 02:19.880
any concept of the future or any concept of history,

02:20.160 --> 02:23.160
because history was just written by the victors. Yeah.

02:23.400 --> 02:28.760
So if I see stuff happen on the day that later that day is reported wrong.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.160
So how wrong is something reported a thousand years ago?

02:32.640 --> 02:36.800
And why would we argue about something that's not in the now?

02:37.120 --> 02:40.360
Because that's the only thing that everyone can agree upon,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.920
is that it is now right now.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.720
Yeah, you try not to make the mistakes of the past.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.080
That's the usefulness of history, the limited usefulness.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.800
The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past.

02:53.320 --> 02:57.080
Too much giving too much value to the past, too much value to the past.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.600
We are now we are now we are here.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.240
We are one species. We are one race.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.800
We're here. And it's time.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.520
And the leadership is changing

03:08.520 --> 03:13.520
because you have Elon as a leader, Ye as a leader, and we are the top leaders.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.640
We're more influential than the presidents.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.680
So you're a human being.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.320
With the engineering challenges before you,

03:21.360 --> 03:23.600
with stem player, with parlor.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.880
What's the hardest thing in front of you on the engineering front?

03:26.880 --> 03:28.640
That's the first sentence

03:28.640 --> 03:32.200
that any of our species needs to hear when they're born.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.320
You are a human being with engineering challenges.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.920
And I consider considered challenges to be opportunities in front of you.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.760
Literally like, let me see a piece of paper.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.720
I need to write that down.

03:43.720 --> 03:47.040
That's the beginning of our new species constitution.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.320
I'm going to do the paper like this.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.480
Why put in widescreen this this for Ridley?

03:56.680 --> 03:59.520
You are.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.400
No, let me like you are.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.160
A being.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.640
With.

04:14.920 --> 04:16.080
In.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.920
Je nearing.

04:22.120 --> 04:23.840
Opportunities.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.800
Or challenges, opportunities.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.320
I'm sorry, I don't spell as good as John Legend.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.800
Opportunities.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.200
And.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
Before you.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.080
I like the before because it can mean

04:45.080 --> 04:48.240
actually can mean forward or before you.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.880
This right here, I've always said I'm the top five writer in human existence.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.760
But this is like this right here is pushing me to like number four, number three.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.080
It's a good because who would you say is the top?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.760
It's top writer in human existence.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.360
We know who it is. That's subjective.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.040
Who is that? It's factual, though.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.840
It's like, OK, who's the top person in tech history?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.480
It's not subjective.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.040
Well, there's a non subjective answer

05:15.960 --> 05:17.200
to both of those.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.720
Both of those people have influence.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.520
30% of our existence.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.600
So the influence is the main metric of greatness.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.240
OK, one person. Yeah.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.520
30% of our language was the English language was written by them.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.760
The other person, 30% of the products we use was led by them.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.560
So they're just out of our language.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.000
Oh, Shakespeare and it was and then the product, product, product, product.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.400
But but Steve Jobs. Yeah.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.640
You put Steve above like Elan's of the world

05:49.120 --> 05:52.680
because Steve is a designer, not he's a designer engineer,

05:52.680 --> 05:55.480
but he's a designer, he's a visionary in the design space.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.080
Well, I would lean to him because I'm not an engineer, right?

05:58.080 --> 05:59.760
So I'm more like then you're an engineer.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.840
If Steve is an engineer, you're an engineer, essentially.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.400
He's a cultural engineer, like the people who run

06:06.400 --> 06:09.520
the emotions of the world and run the world off of people's emotions

06:09.520 --> 06:12.520
right now are social engineers.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.600
And social engineering is so important, like like city design.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.120
There's a fancier word for that.

06:20.120 --> 06:25.200
But I was I was in Oxnard last night to see Anthony Jeselnik.

06:25.840 --> 06:29.280
And I got to find out what his opening joke was

06:29.560 --> 06:32.160
because I'm doing interviews and I'm thinking I'm funny.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.440
And I like that he said he just kept on saying 20 year anniversary.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.360
I've been doing this for 20 years.

06:38.360 --> 06:43.000
And his opening joke was so high level.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.400
I realized that I wasn't funny.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.240
I realized that this dude is a professional at what he does.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.600
And so many things are subjective.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.560
I always talk about this.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.120
It's like, you know, people are arguing like it's Emily Ratajkowski,

06:55.120 --> 06:57.920
the hottest, you know, person.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.480
And I'm like.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.000
That's such a subjective thing.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.200
But like, if you go and shoot three pointers with Steph Curry,

07:06.200 --> 07:08.760
it's not subjective, right?

07:08.760 --> 07:13.520
Or if you go and compare bank accounts with Elon, it's not subjective.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.720
And another thing that's not subjective porn.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.640
What about it?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.640
Dick size is not subjective.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.040
You can measure.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.920
But porn is more about more than just dick size

07:29.920 --> 07:33.360
and greatness is more than the size of the bank account, right?

07:33.640 --> 07:37.160
So there's a subjective greatness is subjective, though. Right.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.000
So do you do you care about the stuff

07:41.160 --> 07:44.640
that's objective or subjective more?

07:44.640 --> 07:46.760
Because greatness to me is what matters.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.200
The bank account comes and goes.

07:50.200 --> 07:53.880
The impact on our society, like you said, social engineering,

07:53.880 --> 07:56.440
the impact on the collective intelligence of our species,

07:56.960 --> 08:00.040
that what permeates throughout the rest of time.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.440
I like what you said, the impact.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.400
I'm taking notes.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.840
How would you say the impact on collective intelligence of our species?

08:10.320 --> 08:15.000
Impact on the collective.

08:15.000 --> 08:22.240
And to have the chance.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.680
When Ye is writing down the words that came out of my dumb mouth,

08:26.280 --> 08:28.680
I have made it in life.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.280
There's a lot of people that have kind of like sit through, sat through.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
I wanted to wear a different color hoodie because I was just tired

08:36.280 --> 08:37.920
of seeing this hoodie in all the interviews.

08:37.920 --> 08:42.680
And there's a lot of kids that are with me.

08:42.680 --> 08:43.800
They see what I'm saying.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.960
Yeah. And they had to sit through all of the muck

08:47.120 --> 08:49.320
of all the previous interviews to get to this.

08:50.040 --> 08:56.960
Every interview has been just an emotional.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.000
It's just like been an argument up to this point.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.640
This is the first of.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.000
This is the next frontier of where our species is going to head.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.080
It starts here. It starts with you, Lex.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.440
So this is the first time I heard you say the word engineering,

09:16.440 --> 09:18.720
at least so many times, which I love hearing.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.840
So this is where you're at.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.880
You're like that newborn.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.840
You're a being with engineering opportunities.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.360
Yeah. And we're all a newborn because in Christianity, we say born again.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.880
We're all newborns.

09:30.880 --> 09:35.000
And everyone can everyone shell like the word can

09:36.600 --> 09:40.520
shell. The only thing about shell is like it kind of dictates

09:40.520 --> 09:43.480
and can kind of kind of lets people off the hook.

09:43.800 --> 09:48.840
So I haven't found the perfect post Shakespeare and post Steve Jobs

09:48.840 --> 09:54.040
and post Elon and post Yay and post Drake way to communicate this.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.160
But we update and we do.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.400
And what the current media structure?

10:04.080 --> 10:05.760
No, it's not actually nothing that's holding us.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.840
There's nothing actually holding us back because I'm still alive.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.280
I'm still alive. Like they could have killed me at,

10:13.400 --> 10:15.560
you know, George Bush don't care about black people.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.440
They could have killed me at Beyonce had the best video.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.440
But we're here now.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.280
So we just keep on leaning and leaning and leaning.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.800
And there's these things where I just think about, you know,

10:26.800 --> 10:29.600
there'll be times when I'm at war.

10:29.600 --> 10:34.840
And every now and then, when the when the bomb stopped going off

10:34.840 --> 10:39.040
and all the headlines and the smearing and all that stuff going off,

10:39.040 --> 10:42.120
I think about my family and I think about Kim

10:42.760 --> 10:45.360
and I think about how, you know,

10:45.720 --> 10:49.320
King Koopa has her in the castle right now and just on

10:50.280 --> 10:53.280
Mario Brothers, you know how it is, just go for the princess

10:53.520 --> 10:54.960
and you get to this level.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.880
And it's like, I'm like, I sung the song wrong. Right.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.520
And then they take the princess again.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.480
Which one are you, Mario? Yeah.

11:05.840 --> 11:10.520
What's your favorite thing, the thing you love the most about Kim

11:11.200 --> 11:13.920
from a Mario perspective and the princess?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.360
Looking back.

11:17.360 --> 11:20.240
Was there a moment she's definitely my favorite of all time.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.360
Yeah. Was there a moment that,

11:23.880 --> 11:28.280
you know, like that catches you off guard and you say, I love this human being.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.560
Yeah, I mean.

11:38.320 --> 11:44.200
It's just the DNA is like she's a mix of Rob and Chris.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.960
Can you explain?

11:46.960 --> 11:51.480
I mean, that's like a really high pool right there.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.040
Those are like two geniuses.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.280
So, OK, so like the entire of a history of evolution

12:03.280 --> 12:07.560
of the human species created this DNA that created this being.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.200
There's a life there.

12:09.200 --> 12:12.160
There's a set of memories in the history that brought you together.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.760
And you're like, damn, I like this DNA.

12:15.760 --> 12:19.720
Yeah. So certain people have just like high DNA.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.680
Ivanka Trump has high DNA.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.320
You know, it's like, how's your DNA?

12:25.320 --> 12:26.320
Pretty good.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.360
I think we've seen that. It's been proven.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.440
I mean, but look at my look at my mom and look at my dad.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.200
You know, me and my dad have a water purification center in the D.R.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.520
right now, and my dad is the original Steve Jobs.

12:40.560 --> 12:45.560
And he was blocked by people around him and people were using him

12:45.560 --> 12:48.640
and taking advantage and, you know, not believing in his vision.

12:48.640 --> 12:50.880
He's my dad's the educated version of Ye.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.520
What did you learn about life from your dad?

12:55.520 --> 12:57.040
And my dad got girls, too.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.600
But those are small details.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.280
That's a big detail, being that I found my dad's

13:02.680 --> 13:04.480
playboy when I was five years old.

13:04.480 --> 13:08.320
It greatly affected my motivation.

13:09.080 --> 13:09.960
Yeah. All right.

13:09.960 --> 13:11.800
So that's part of the engine that drives.

13:11.800 --> 13:12.680
Yay. Absolutely.

13:12.680 --> 13:16.160
I remember when Pharrell was first in all the videos

13:16.800 --> 13:21.160
and my girl was like girls like Pharrell.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.360
And I was like, I want girls to like me, too.

13:23.800 --> 13:27.720
Funny that that's behind all the ambition, all the drive.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.520
That's how we make people.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.320
That's how people are made.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.920
It's the desire to be loved.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.880
Is that at the individual level, just being noticed

13:39.000 --> 13:41.040
and also at the societal level of scale?

13:41.400 --> 13:45.280
Well, now. I've I've gone past.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.240
I'm like at that place where Nikolai Tesla was

13:50.800 --> 13:55.840
later into his career, where it wasn't about being loved.

13:55.840 --> 14:00.040
It wasn't about sitting at the dinner parties next to Anna Wintour and stuff.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.880
It was about getting the idea across.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.240
So I have these cells.

14:09.120 --> 14:12.400
That are very and I just keep on saying, really, Scott,

14:12.400 --> 14:17.000
but really, Scott has a special anointing.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.600
It isn't just sci fi what he's doing.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.760
There's something in there just like George Lucas.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.640
There's something different that's there.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.040
So. What are you drawing?

14:29.040 --> 14:33.440
I'm drawing these new living cells that we will exist in.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.520
And this is over.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.160
OK, let's do like.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.360
I don't like talking about money because, like, manmade money up anyway,

14:46.360 --> 14:50.320
it's like four quadrillion respected dollars,

14:50.320 --> 14:52.440
and then you have other forms of currency.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.040
Of course, social currency is super important right now,

14:55.040 --> 15:02.400
but this is a drawing and it's at a pretty good place now.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.160
This will be 40,000 square feet.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.800
I want to start just talking in meters.

15:06.800 --> 15:12.240
I just think we should go to anything to restore the Tower of Basel.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.880
Like they said when the.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.920
I'm just draw a person here for scale.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.520
Yeah, that would be great.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.840
So. Yeah, that would help.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.680
OK. What do you think of that?

15:26.680 --> 15:29.680
Look at my purse and see the scale in this room.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.040
All right. So.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.320
Wait, the dot is the person. Yeah.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.000
I'm saying it's 40,000 square feet.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.320
But that would be like one of the parts of the cell.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.960
OK, so it's a screen.

15:42.960 --> 15:47.560
It doesn't go all the all the way to the top, and it's one hole for light.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.440
But the water and the light and air all come in from the top.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.560
So that's like, like the mouth.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.680
And then this is the belly button.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.520
We're God's iPhone. We're his greatest creation.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.640
So this is all connected.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.560
These are all connected.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.240
Yes, I'm drawing how these other cells go next to each other.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.120
What's the vision here?

16:09.320 --> 16:12.560
Happiness that we talk about, like, what's the motivation like?

16:12.560 --> 16:16.440
Yeah, there's a motivation somewhere in the back of my mind of.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.160
My family and.

16:21.040 --> 16:26.080
If it's like where Moses smite the rock and God didn't allow him

16:26.800 --> 16:31.760
to get to the promised land, because the promised land is family.

16:32.320 --> 16:33.440
That is the problem.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.160
That is Earth.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.360
I mean, that's heaven on Earth is family. Family is heaven.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.720
That's the promised land.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.920
And for your family to be together.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.520
So say I smite the rock and God doesn't let me

16:47.280 --> 16:48.920
have my family back.

16:48.920 --> 16:52.320
My mission and life is still to.

16:53.600 --> 16:59.840
Promote families at all costs and make families existence easier.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.720
So you take this thing, you put localized

17:03.400 --> 17:07.600
a localized farm, save us in community that we we do localized growing.

17:07.600 --> 17:12.520
And then we partner with Big Pharma and all and say, hey,

17:12.520 --> 17:16.160
you're actually going to make more money by making better food.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.920
Because at the end of day, you want money right now.

17:18.920 --> 17:22.320
It's like everyone knows that between the pesticides

17:22.320 --> 17:24.400
and between the medical industry, and especially America,

17:24.400 --> 17:25.800
that we're keeping people sick.

17:25.800 --> 17:28.960
And we know that McDonald's makes food that kills people.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.680
And, you know, Coca-Cola selling, you know, sugar water and all this like.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.000
Just in case I haven't pissed off enough people in power.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.880
Yeah. OK, so you're going to piss off the sugar.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.400
And anybody that's powered on sugar sugar with sugar, what's the health

17:43.760 --> 17:46.920
was actually a document documentary on sugar.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.640
It wasn't about how bad meat was.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
It was like a reverse documentary on sugar or refer.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.720
I don't know if you call it a reverse, like a sub.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.400
But if you watch it again, when they show sugar and it's just

17:59.160 --> 18:01.440
the sugar looks super clean.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.960
Yeah, as I state, as I state these things,

18:06.560 --> 18:09.400
I know that I know I have protection.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.280
If I have God's protection,

18:12.280 --> 18:14.200
that's why I'm here to this date. Right.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.880
So it it's for me to have this platform

18:17.880 --> 18:20.840
and express exactly what I feel because it's kids out there.

18:21.240 --> 18:22.800
Right. That

18:24.960 --> 18:28.400
it's kids that are going to save the world through engineering and through facts.

18:29.160 --> 18:34.920
And I've got to get download as much of the information

18:34.920 --> 18:38.680
and as much of the don't be afraid to state your facts

18:39.120 --> 18:42.800
is the biggest thing, because the world is being ran by fear.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.680
And that is no, actually, God runs the world.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.560
But there's just like little cloud, this patina of our ego

18:50.680 --> 18:53.800
that deals with the money and the car and the girl we're dating

18:53.800 --> 18:56.400
and all this in the clothes you wear and spending too much on clothes.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.560
And a lot of stuff that I've been involved with promoting.

18:58.560 --> 19:01.280
So now what I'm promoting is you have the idea.

19:01.280 --> 19:06.320
You say it out loud like you like if you had Tourette's say your truth out loud.

19:06.320 --> 19:10.120
If you hate, yeah, you hate me, say that out loud, say whatever you feel

19:10.880 --> 19:16.480
out loud, like you say it nonviolently, you know, nonviolent,

19:16.760 --> 19:19.840
not if I have to say that, like, as you know, you know,

19:20.320 --> 19:24.520
as a shout out to Alex Jones, you know, and Trump, where they try to say

19:24.520 --> 19:27.480
that when they say their truths out loud, that it's inciting violence.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.720
So let's be like really clear.

19:29.720 --> 19:33.880
I'm saying that they have a criminalized free thought.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.600
The, you know, they I hate when people use they like they gets to blame

19:38.600 --> 19:40.120
for everything, right? It's always they.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.120
Yeah. Who the who the fuck is that?

19:42.120 --> 19:45.000
Exactly. The problem is they's us.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.080
Yeah. Well, I love that.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.680
What we needed to do is turn I to we.

19:50.680 --> 19:54.160
So we take the responsibility and turn they to us.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.240
So we take accountability to us.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.960
They I to we and they to us.

20:02.680 --> 20:03.760
And that relates.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.240
It's a language at the same time.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.040
You've seen the language of our surroundings.

20:08.440 --> 20:12.400
You're seeing the language of one of the things.

20:12.400 --> 20:17.360
OK, let's go back to the cell explanation, because I'm also doing it.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.520
What's that thing when Elon just put all the information open

20:20.520 --> 20:23.400
and people could figure out they could figure it out and open source?

20:23.400 --> 20:24.000
Yeah, open source.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.640
So I'm open sourcing this idea right now so that, you know,

20:29.520 --> 20:32.880
engineers and anointed people,

20:33.840 --> 20:37.600
beings, anointed beings can collectively contribute

20:37.600 --> 20:39.920
to this to push our species forward.

20:41.880 --> 20:47.520
So where I've got to with my research is that there will be a hole at the top

20:48.120 --> 20:52.040
that allows natural light, natural air,

20:52.600 --> 20:55.760
and there's a constant water system.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.080
So it becomes like a water city where it's a constant flow.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.920
That's not it's it's regenerative.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.480
It's not wasting the water.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.200
And it's just a constant flow.

21:05.200 --> 21:08.360
So I put the toilet really close to where this

21:09.800 --> 21:13.040
this I don't want to call it a wave pool,

21:13.040 --> 21:15.080
but in the pool, the water is not still.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.760
So that exists in in water.

21:19.000 --> 21:19.400
Yeah.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.480
About water. Well, the living room is that you have two rooms.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.680
You have the dry room,

21:23.680 --> 21:26.240
which people would call the living room before.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.960
And then you have the wet room.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.600
How is that a source of happiness?

21:33.600 --> 21:37.480
What is what is broken about our world today that that gives you

21:37.480 --> 21:40.680
in terms of the pursuit of happiness, which is one of the things

21:40.880 --> 21:45.680
all of our previous declaration of all of our buildings are based on just

21:47.480 --> 21:49.720
the industry and the economy.

21:49.720 --> 21:53.480
And then people lean into what people are used to seeing.

21:54.600 --> 21:59.280
Like what we think is attractive, because then you go back to

22:00.440 --> 22:03.880
the, you know, women who give life.

22:04.360 --> 22:08.240
So everyone wants to be attractive.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.560
To the attractive.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.560
And that's the reason why the media

22:15.360 --> 22:20.200
goes and gets, you know, Bella Hadid, Kim Kardashian,

22:21.200 --> 22:23.120
Emily Ratajkowski.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.640
Those are the only ones I'm going to.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.760
There's more.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.800
There's more, but I'm I'm thinking of ones that I think are attractive.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.560
Yeah, it is subjective.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.520
Yeah, because it's subjective.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.720
So to my subjective, which I think I think

22:41.320 --> 22:43.960
the only guys that could argue with me on

22:45.480 --> 22:48.920
my opinion on girls would be Brad and Leo,

22:49.560 --> 22:53.160
because we're the only ones with the track record, you know, everything else.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.040
So for everybody else is subjective.

22:55.040 --> 22:59.920
We've got history. So are you are you are you happy?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.200
Absolutely. I'm just here.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.640
It's actually.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.520
It's difficult to make me.

23:13.160 --> 23:15.560
Unhappy, not to deal with frustrations,

23:16.560 --> 23:18.680
but when those frustrations are, it's like

23:20.200 --> 23:24.120
when you've allowed people to be in your life that shouldn't be there

23:24.720 --> 23:27.160
and then they do the thing you knew they were going to do

23:27.160 --> 23:30.200
and you're screaming at them, but you really need to scream at yourself.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.520
Yeah, so you realize anything that's like anger or frustration,

23:36.960 --> 23:39.640
that's something that's wrong with you that needs to be dealt with.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.920
Yes, like right now, OK, say I got this pattern cutter

23:44.920 --> 23:49.280
that I wanted to remove

23:49.280 --> 23:53.040
because I felt like she was copying our patterns into the computer.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.000
And I didn't know why she wanted to do that.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.160
And I just wanted to do the patterns by hand.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.480
And then, you know, you mean like automating the patterns?

24:01.520 --> 24:05.520
Yeah. And my head of it, because they just that's the whole thing.

24:05.520 --> 24:11.320
It's like. It's a war of it's a war of human beings and robots.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.240
But that makes it more efficient, right?

24:13.240 --> 24:14.400
You don't like the efficiency.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.280
You like the creativity of the singular nature of the pattern.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.080
I believe that the human beings.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.880
And I'm saying this to you as a person who makes robots

24:22.880 --> 24:25.040
and a person is friends with you. I'm deeply offended right now.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.600
Yeah. Well, you know, I'll let it go.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.760
OK. So, yeah, I believe that they hate robots.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
I'm not going to put that out there. It's a joke.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.960
Robots have feelings, too. Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.480
That was also a joke.

24:39.480 --> 24:42.400
Was it we need to clarify that for future robots?

24:43.560 --> 24:46.560
But the pattern cutter, the pattern cutter, you don't like that.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.360
I had to be that that's you can't have that part of your life.

24:51.440 --> 24:57.520
That's not what I'm my everything that I'm doing is for.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.280
The sake of the human race.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.880
There's things in capitalism, there's things in technology.

25:11.240 --> 25:18.160
Well, tech technology and original human species can exist.

25:19.320 --> 25:23.200
And a peaceful way.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.960
As long as the people that know how to make robots

25:26.280 --> 25:28.920
aren't using their robots to control the humans.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.000
Lex, definitely something you have to be concerned about

25:33.000 --> 25:35.400
as we become more technologically savvy.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.240
That, my friend, is why engineering isn't everything

25:39.800 --> 25:43.560
that you have to desperately study the lessons of history.

25:44.120 --> 25:49.440
In Nazi Germany, science was used to create atrocities.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.960
Engineering, the same engineering could be a tool of war.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.560
We are still in the Holocaust.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.240
A friend, a Jewish friend of mine said.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.640
The come go visit the Holocaust Museum.

26:05.640 --> 26:09.000
And my response was, let's visit our Holocaust Museum,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.640
Planned Parenthood.

26:10.640 --> 26:14.440
With all due respect, I grew up in the Soviet Union.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.800
I'm Jewish.

26:18.560 --> 26:23.720
Parts of my family perished in the Holocaust of Nazi Germany.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.520
I have to push back that there is a difference

26:28.240 --> 26:33.240
of the atrocities at that scale, at that time on an entire people.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.560
I was going to say the number, that's the difference.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.680
It's not the number.

26:36.720 --> 26:42.920
Because six million, well, also, African-Americans are actually Jew also.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.480
The lost tribe of Israel.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.480
I can push back on that, too.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.920
OK, so, well, everyone came from Africa.

26:48.560 --> 26:49.720
I am African.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.600
I'm basically African-American.

26:51.600 --> 26:52.400
We're brothers.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.120
And we're both Jew, and we're brothers.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.360
We're human.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.520
Six million people died in the Holocaust.

26:58.520 --> 27:01.400
Over 20 million have died by the hands of abortion.

27:01.720 --> 27:06.000
And the media promotes the My Body, My Choice,

27:06.400 --> 27:10.240
which is actually still a promotion for Planned Parenthood.

27:10.960 --> 27:16.760
50% of black deaths a year is actually abortion.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.920
It's not the cop with the knee.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.480
It's not black on black violence and gang violence.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.600
It's not heart attacks.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.800
It's actually abortion.

27:23.800 --> 27:29.600
The most dangerous place for a black person in America is in their mother's stomach.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.680
There's 900 to a million abortions in the United States a year.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.080
I hear you.

27:38.520 --> 27:45.360
But there's something about the rape, the torture, the murder of children,

27:45.360 --> 27:51.240
women, men, the complete humiliation and just the suffering

27:51.240 --> 27:53.480
that was endured during World War II.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.320
That's what we deal with on our TVs right now with black people.

27:58.200 --> 28:04.120
Soros would use black trauma economy for to win an election.

28:05.080 --> 28:09.560
And what I love is having a healthy conversation as opposed to there's certain things,

28:09.560 --> 28:12.680
you know, boom, this drops, people are going to have pussy hats on.

28:12.680 --> 28:14.120
Boom, this drops.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.280
It's going to be black people and white people with signs.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.360
Boom, this drops.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.800
So hey, China, hey, Left Agenda, hey.

28:22.800 --> 28:27.080
What we're going to do is say that our species can have a healthy conversation.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.120
Can I just linger on this?

28:30.240 --> 28:33.040
Because when you say Jewish media,

28:33.040 --> 28:38.520
it there's a echo of a pain that people feel that reminds you.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.440
You're saying it's redundant, right?

28:41.440 --> 28:43.160
No, I'm not saying it's redundant.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.280
I'm saying it's redundant.

28:44.280 --> 28:45.760
You're saying it's redundant.

28:45.760 --> 28:49.480
It's a saying it's something that I'm saying that it's something that Joseph

28:49.480 --> 28:53.520
Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Nazi Germany, said.

28:53.800 --> 28:58.760
I'm saying it's been said so many times in order to murder

28:58.760 --> 29:02.240
and torture Jewish people

29:02.880 --> 29:05.200
that it just rings wrong.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.600
And that's just like the N word when spoken by people

29:09.600 --> 29:11.720
that have the same skin color as me.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.720
It reminds people of a very dark time.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.120
I know if Jewish people would accept that I'm Jew,

29:19.320 --> 29:21.720
then they would see what I'm saying in a different way.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.160
They would hear it in a different way.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.960
But see the people you saying you're Jewish.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.000
No, I'm Jew, not Jewish.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.480
Jewish means like that of a Jew.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.360
I'm saying I'm Jew. You're Jew.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.960
Blood of Christ. That comes from right.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.920
But that are you

29:38.920 --> 29:43.400
are you a follower of the philosophy of the black Hebrew Israelites?

29:44.360 --> 29:46.480
Because that's where the idea comes from.

29:47.760 --> 29:51.880
Not all of those folks are extremists, but some are extremists.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.880
I'm a follower of the idea.

29:54.960 --> 29:59.440
I have a vague idea that all people came from Africa.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.360
But what I wanted to do now, OK,

30:03.880 --> 30:07.600
now I could Andy Kaufman this about seven more minutes

30:08.160 --> 30:10.360
and then tell you what it is.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.920
What should I count? Let's count seven minutes.

30:13.160 --> 30:16.000
No, I did this to do a spoiler alert.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.360
Sure. Spoiler.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.320
What's the first thing I said at the beginning?

30:21.160 --> 30:23.880
We're talking about engineering and humans were all.

30:23.880 --> 30:26.880
And I said, and then what did I say we shouldn't focus on?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.960
Race. Not just that.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.680
I said they shouldn't teach this in school.

30:32.680 --> 30:36.360
History, the history, because what they do,

30:36.400 --> 30:40.680
what schools are doing is exactly what the CIA does

30:40.960 --> 30:43.080
with Pixar films and Disney films.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.640
They make Bambi's mom die in the beginning.

30:46.720 --> 30:52.560
Right. And off that pain comes a purchase of ice cream.

30:52.760 --> 30:54.200
Off that pain comes.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.360
I need some more toys. Off that pain comes.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.360
I need a bigger house.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.760
Off that pain comes.

30:58.760 --> 31:01.600
I need more girls than my wife. Off that pain comes.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.840
So they put that pain in to make us

31:06.760 --> 31:10.080
now we're the orphans of capitalism, to make us be consumers.

31:10.400 --> 31:14.120
And we need to be a community, not just consumers.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.520
So I could have went another seven minutes by being a person

31:19.720 --> 31:21.840
who presents himself in a way that says,

31:22.000 --> 31:25.640
well, I don't have to feel your pain because I also have pain, too,

31:25.640 --> 31:26.960
that's not being recognized.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.120
And in every interview, when I say, well,

31:29.120 --> 31:32.200
why did I get to the point of putting up the tweet?

31:32.200 --> 31:35.880
No one wants to understand why I got to that point.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.320
Right. Pain. You had pain.

31:37.320 --> 31:38.760
Yeah. But no one in your heart.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.200
But the let's say this.

31:41.200 --> 31:45.760
Undoubtedly, Jewish people have a lot of movies

31:46.280 --> 31:48.720
about that pain.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.560
And black people have a lot of movies about the pain of slavery.

31:53.880 --> 31:59.280
Right. It's almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Munsa.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.200
When you go to the African History Museum in Washington, D.C.,

32:03.440 --> 32:09.320
it doesn't start with the idea of Africans being kings.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.960
It starts with the idea of Africans being slaves.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.840
But here's another interesting point about this.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.400
This was said to me one time and it stuck with me as a family member of mine.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.360
With Africans, how many times you've heard like a rapper, you know,

32:24.360 --> 32:27.000
talk about we were kings.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.160
That's incorrect.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.120
If we're a Jew.

32:34.280 --> 32:38.040
If we're a Jew, and since we are, we weren't the kings,

32:38.640 --> 32:41.360
we were the slaves that Moses freed.

32:42.360 --> 32:46.360
Africans have always said we've heard you've listened to rap music

32:46.360 --> 32:49.800
and hear black people say we kings, we blood of the pharaohs.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.720
And if we are Jew, then we weren't.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.880
We were the people that Moses freed.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.080
And when we talk about have you heard black people talk about 400 years of slavery?

33:05.000 --> 33:07.800
All right. That is in rep.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.160
And we're having this history lesson, right?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.600
And history doesn't matter.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.920
You're exploring ancient history and drawing deep wisdom from it.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.240
And at the same time, saying we need to forget all of it.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.440
We need to put that behind us. Absolutely.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.720
We need to forget it and we need to move forward.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.720
There is so much wisdom to draw from history, even the 20th century.

33:31.200 --> 33:36.960
Look at this communism without the lessons of history of the 20th century.

33:37.440 --> 33:40.040
Communism sounds like a great idea.

33:40.040 --> 33:42.800
Except that some of the worst atrocities

33:43.520 --> 33:46.760
conducted by Stalin and Mao that killed

33:48.160 --> 33:51.480
50, 100 plus million people, not just killed,

33:51.480 --> 33:56.120
tortured starvation where people the cannibalism, they ate each other.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.000
They ate their children.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.720
There's there's just dark people.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.520
People should read some books on this on the Hollander more.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.480
See, 1930s, I disagree with that lesson.

34:07.720 --> 34:10.320
We would. And now it's becoming more popular.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.480
Marxism and communism.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.680
I'm not disagreeing that that happened.

34:13.680 --> 34:16.680
I'm disagreeing that.

34:16.680 --> 34:20.520
We need to harp on the things that happen, because the truth is

34:20.880 --> 34:25.520
I'm giving a fact 50 percent today of

34:26.360 --> 34:28.960
that say, you don't call black people, do you?

34:28.960 --> 34:35.200
Right. Black people's deaths today is abortion today right now.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.600
Like that. It's not racism.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.080
That's too wide of a term.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.560
It's genocide and population control

34:44.880 --> 34:49.680
that black people are in today in America that is promoted

34:49.960 --> 34:53.880
by the music and the media that black people make

34:54.240 --> 34:58.120
that Jewish record labels get paid off of or media companies

34:58.560 --> 34:59.880
record labels, media company also.

34:59.880 --> 35:00.920
So let's give it a wider.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.880
You know, I agree with Martin Luther King.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.440
I have a dream, too, Martin, that one day

35:07.440 --> 35:11.040
was would not be judged by the color of your skin

35:11.720 --> 35:16.600
or your race, black or Jew, but by the content of your character,

35:16.600 --> 35:20.200
all the assholes that fucked you over in the music industry, fuck

35:21.240 --> 35:24.320
artists over in the music industry are individuals.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.120
They're not Jews.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.360
Can you can you say they are they are Jewish?

35:29.120 --> 35:32.920
It doesn't. They're human with opportunities

35:33.520 --> 35:35.440
and they took those opportunities.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.400
I don't care if they're Jewish.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.120
Do you feel like I should release that pain and separate it?

35:41.480 --> 35:44.640
Yes. OK, so if that OK, so if you're saying

35:44.640 --> 35:48.960
I should release that pain and separate it, then I'm telling you

35:49.200 --> 35:53.560
you should release your pain and separate it and we could get to this

35:53.840 --> 35:59.080
the list of how you are being with engineering opportunities.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.120
That's 100 percent.

36:00.120 --> 36:02.520
I see what you're doing that exactly you're doing.

36:02.760 --> 36:05.160
The pain. I'm going to let it go.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.680
Engineering challenges. I get it.

36:07.680 --> 36:11.120
One of the problems you highlight is people get fucked over in the

36:11.120 --> 36:14.920
in the music industry and get fucked over in the media.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.000
Get fucked over all over the place.

36:17.000 --> 36:17.840
They create it.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.720
There is a there is a Jewish trainer

36:21.520 --> 36:25.920
that brought me to the hospital and put in press that I went to the hospital.

36:25.920 --> 36:30.280
I got friends that off of exhaustion, a Jewish doctor, they died.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.120
I don't think Jewish because they were right.

36:33.440 --> 36:39.040
Diagnose me with bipolar disorder and shot me with medication

36:39.040 --> 36:41.640
and put me on medication, then put it in the press.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.920
And every time, even if I wore the wrong color hat

36:45.160 --> 36:47.840
that a nigger is not supposed to wear, right.

36:48.720 --> 36:52.120
Then they immediately say he's off of his shit.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.360
He's off his meds, he's off his rocker.

36:54.360 --> 36:59.640
And it's literally used as a scarlet letter control mechanism for the people

36:59.640 --> 37:03.480
understand the kids, the colleges, the high schools.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.480
What do you think they put me right now?

37:07.560 --> 37:10.640
They put me as the prophet, not the leader.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.040
It doesn't have to be the leader, right, because we need

37:13.040 --> 37:16.200
we need a more intelligent person to be the leader.

37:16.320 --> 37:19.400
But at least, right, they put me as the prophet.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.200
They put me as the only person that would say this.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.680
And I'm just saying that was four Jewish members

37:25.920 --> 37:31.360
that controlled my voice because for the fact that 90 percent

37:31.360 --> 37:35.640
of black people in entertainment, from sports to music, to acting,

37:36.000 --> 37:40.480
are in some way tied into Jewish business people,

37:40.680 --> 37:46.280
meaning that in some way, just like if if Ram is sitting next to Obama

37:46.280 --> 37:50.640
or Jared sitting next to Trump, there's a Jewish person right there

37:50.640 --> 37:55.560
controlling the country, the Jewish controlling

37:55.920 --> 38:00.880
that who gets the best video or not, controlling what the media says about me.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.840
The person is not Jewish.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.760
Let me just say one thing. But they are, though.

38:04.760 --> 38:07.000
That's the only thing. It just so happens that they are.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.840
It just happens that they are.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.800
That doesn't mean that I hate them.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.920
That just means that they are.

38:12.920 --> 38:19.160
But it's a it's a dog whistle to let me just say, as I would love to add

38:19.760 --> 38:22.840
more love to the world, I would love you to do that

38:23.120 --> 38:26.080
as a person with a big voice, with a big, powerful voice

38:26.080 --> 38:27.760
that a lot of people look up to.

38:27.760 --> 38:31.840
And when you say Jewish media, it's funny how this world works that way.

38:31.840 --> 38:35.800
When you say Jewish media or Jews are controlling

38:35.800 --> 38:40.400
the voice of black artists, black people, black artists.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.160
And when you say that, I'm not allowed to say it out loud.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
You can say it.

38:44.160 --> 38:48.160
There's a large number of people that are hurting and have anger

38:48.160 --> 38:50.440
and even have hate in their heart.

38:50.440 --> 38:55.160
When they when they hear Jewish media, they start that hate

38:55.160 --> 38:57.440
starts being directed towards the Jewish people.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.760
Do you acknowledge that?

39:00.760 --> 39:02.520
That's do you understand?

39:02.520 --> 39:05.240
Can you feel the hate in the world?

39:05.640 --> 39:10.200
That's when that that comes to the surface when you say stuff like that.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.720
OK, I I feel that.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.600
When we go into therapy, my dad was a therapist

39:17.600 --> 39:21.840
and obviously I've got some therapy skills myself.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.920
A lot of people, my music is healing.

39:24.920 --> 39:28.160
These type of spa like existences are healing.

39:28.520 --> 39:32.480
The color palettes I use are healing and we can use healing words, right?

39:33.560 --> 39:37.480
What I really feel there,

39:37.480 --> 39:40.680
I feel that there is no accountability and no responsibility

39:40.800 --> 39:45.760
on Jewish people in media to at least start with owning up

39:45.760 --> 39:49.040
with the facts of what's dealt with and tell me

39:49.360 --> 39:53.520
if I say the facts out loud to the point of Ari Emanuel

39:53.520 --> 39:57.720
writing a letter in the Financial Times, trying to take food

39:57.720 --> 40:00.840
out of my children's mouth, telling people that they're not allowed

40:00.840 --> 40:05.840
to work with me, even Chris Como or Piers Morgan

40:06.120 --> 40:09.080
getting me to apologize and separate

40:09.920 --> 40:14.760
Jewish business people to from the families of the Jewish business people,

40:14.760 --> 40:16.760
which I did update.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.480
I did that. That already happened.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.040
And that was a shitty apology.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.600
That wasn't really an apology.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.520
But shout out to that conversation.

40:23.520 --> 40:28.120
I need to get on my knees and kiss the dick of Howard Stern.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.520
And you don't need to kiss anyone's dick.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.960
But that's what you guys are acting like.

40:32.960 --> 40:36.720
You guys look at that because you're talking about as a shitty opinion

40:37.640 --> 40:40.960
apology. But where's our fucking apology?

40:41.320 --> 40:43.400
Watch this. So we don't get.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.680
Thank you. Now, let's move on. Sorry.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.960
Oh, do I need to get on my knees or no?

40:48.960 --> 40:51.640
And kiss my dick. Oh, shit.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.320
So escalated quickly.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.800
So that's escalated quickly.

40:56.880 --> 41:02.840
So the so what I'm saying, where's our apology?

41:02.920 --> 41:06.800
But we can't get to apology because you're telling me

41:06.800 --> 41:09.320
there's no right way for me to word it.

41:09.560 --> 41:12.840
So tell me for me, a person who's been

41:12.840 --> 41:16.880
fucked all my deals and a person that has friends

41:16.880 --> 41:20.600
that never figured out how to make shoes with a German company

41:20.800 --> 41:24.480
that couldn't tell me to wear a BLM shirt and take off my red hat.

41:24.520 --> 41:27.240
Like what would have happened if I was at Nike? Right.

41:29.320 --> 41:34.240
Tell me exactly how to engineer the situation.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.520
I'll tell you exactly how you got a big voice.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.840
Have the balls as a man to call out the individuals.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.080
Don't call them Jews.

41:41.080 --> 41:45.920
Call them by their name and start a war against those individuals.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.800
They're not Jewish.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.720
But if that's the case, will you help me with that?

41:50.120 --> 41:52.360
Sure. OK. 100 percent.

41:52.360 --> 41:55.240
Assholes are asked. Well, let me like flip that, too.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.240
I don't understand the industry well.

41:57.240 --> 42:00.200
I see that people are fucking people over for sure.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.720
But how do you solve that?

42:01.720 --> 42:05.440
If you run, if you right now run the world's

42:06.160 --> 42:09.240
you're doing a million things, but say you ran also a record label.

42:10.040 --> 42:11.240
I have ran a record label.

42:11.240 --> 42:14.840
I've been ran by a record label where I was the face of a record label

42:14.840 --> 42:18.040
and had Big Sean and different people complaining to me.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.160
And I knew fuck about running a record label.

42:20.160 --> 42:24.240
I was simply just a talented producer and an influencer.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.800
I then started good music, but I wasn't the one running good music.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.400
How would you do it differently?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.280
This is something I propose.

42:31.280 --> 42:33.040
I would look at.

42:33.480 --> 42:38.280
The top 10 execs and three fields in sports,

42:39.880 --> 42:42.560
film and music.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.880
And I would look at the top 10

42:47.400 --> 42:49.800
clients, participants, talent.

42:50.200 --> 42:53.840
I would look at the top talent in each of those fields, the top 10 of them.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.480
And some of them are going to be Tom Brady.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.960
Some of them are going to be Taylor Swift.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.040
Some of them, they're not all going to be black, right? Some of them.

43:00.280 --> 43:04.480
So some of them will be Adele, right?

43:05.680 --> 43:09.280
And we'll look at all their contracts

43:10.320 --> 43:14.280
transparently and we'll compare the notes

43:14.520 --> 43:17.400
and re-engineer like it's a new constitution.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.160
Because when I told my dad, when I was 19, I was going to get into

43:21.520 --> 43:23.560
the music industry, he begged me not to.

43:23.560 --> 43:25.760
He said, I heard it's treacherous.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.720
Now I'm in a position where I've been through it.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.360
I saw it. I went out, made some money somewhere else.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.360
I saw my name get smeared.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.560
I saw my family get destroyed.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.720
I saw my reputation get destroyed.

43:37.720 --> 43:41.880
And I'm back here to have this kind of I'm back here as a being

43:42.280 --> 43:43.880
with engineering opportunities.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.560
So I would say if you say as a shitty apology, what is the version

43:50.280 --> 43:52.760
of the apology short of kissing Howard Stern's dick?

43:53.760 --> 43:55.880
I don't think anyone wants to kiss Howard Stern's dick.

43:55.880 --> 43:56.680
That's the whole point.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.280
Howard Stern, nobody wants to kiss your dick.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.480
So shut the fuck up.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.200
I said, by the way, I'm antagonize you, Howard Stern.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.640
I used to be a fan of you.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.440
Yeah, me too. Yeah.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.440
I'm still a fan sometimes.

44:08.440 --> 44:11.080
Now you're just doing click bait like everybody else.

44:11.960 --> 44:15.000
Now you're just a sad old man, Howard. All right.

44:15.960 --> 44:21.120
Now, Howard Stern, this is the first time anyone's said your name in years.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.240
Your own family doesn't say your name unless they're calling to get their bills paid.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.760
You're going hard.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.560
See, that's beautiful right there.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.840
That's much better than calling Jewish media.

44:35.400 --> 44:36.920
Go after individuals.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.920
OK, so after individual and you don't talk shit about me, talk shit about me.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.240
This is great. And you know what that is? Yeah. What's that?

44:45.480 --> 44:47.760
Engineering, that's an engineer's approach.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.800
Yeah. Engineers. Yeah. Yeah.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.520
You should learn some of that.

44:51.520 --> 44:56.080
We all can use our pain against each other, or we can say we're being

44:56.720 --> 45:00.600
with engineering opportunities and we can know about history.

45:00.600 --> 45:03.280
So let me change something we can have.

45:05.240 --> 45:08.280
A just to be judgmental, people say that should not judge.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.360
I was talking to Camille Vasquez.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.160
She says, I'm very judgmental. That's what we're doing.

45:12.160 --> 45:17.080
We I believe now you could go to Bible and one thing is going to say one thing.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.720
Another thing may be contradicted in a way.

45:19.720 --> 45:23.280
And then the pastor has to unpack it. I believe.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.320
That we are to judge.

45:26.800 --> 45:31.760
If you look at some food and it's got a fly coming out of it,

45:32.240 --> 45:35.000
you can then judge at that point.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.920
You're supposed to use your better judgment.

45:36.920 --> 45:40.080
But whenever someone doesn't want to change something they're doing,

45:40.080 --> 45:42.840
they'll say, don't judge me. Right.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.960
But as a species, you call it for me.

45:45.960 --> 45:47.360
You got the breakthrough.

45:47.360 --> 45:51.120
And by the way, it's only an engineer that I would respect

45:51.480 --> 45:56.320
to tell me of how of how to update how I'm communicating,

45:56.520 --> 45:58.240
because this started off. Right.

45:58.240 --> 46:01.560
I've been through all these interviews.

46:02.600 --> 46:06.320
Let me go to this. You said this was a sorry apology.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.320
I was very specific.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.600
I said the Jewish because, by the way, it's a barrage. Right.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.520
It's a thing where I don't even remember the names at a certain point. Right.

46:14.760 --> 46:19.840
It's like if a if a girl was getting raped by men,

46:22.120 --> 46:27.040
if that person is not 18, right, and she's getting raped since 14. Right.

46:27.720 --> 46:33.560
And she still got this face, this super like Irina Shake level face. Right.

46:35.560 --> 46:38.320
She might say, I hate men.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.360
That woman may say, I hate men.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.000
She might get to that point because she was raped.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.280
All my contracts and no one can say this is ramped up.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.160
Knowing Howard Stern can't say this is ramped up.

46:51.160 --> 46:53.280
Ari Emanuel can't say this is ramped up.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.080
George Soros knows damn well that I'm not ramped up.

46:57.080 --> 47:02.040
George Soros knows like, wow, this guy's like a younger guy

47:02.040 --> 47:07.560
that's looking at what I did and looking at how I control the world silently.

47:07.920 --> 47:09.560
And he's calling it out.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.800
And he's not using any of the fear tactics.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.480
I can't send his homeboys around him.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.240
I can't send his wife to him.

47:16.280 --> 47:20.040
This guy, that's what George Soros sees, right, when he's dealing with me.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.800
Right. So what you guys are actually asking me to do,

47:23.800 --> 47:27.600
I'm comparing myself to that 18 year old, beautiful

47:28.600 --> 47:33.560
woman that had been mistreated by men for four years of her life. Right.

47:34.000 --> 47:39.400
And you're saying, you know, as a man, you can't blame all men.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.560
And I'm saying as a responsible

47:42.720 --> 47:50.520
forward, philosopher, leader, OK, I'll drop the pain and I will specify

47:50.520 --> 47:54.160
because I'm up here. I lost my fucking family.

47:54.280 --> 47:56.080
I lost my kids.

47:56.080 --> 47:58.640
I lost my best friend in fashion.

47:58.960 --> 48:01.440
I lost I lost the black community.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.880
I lost, you know, people said I lost my mind.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.320
All of these things lost my reputation.

48:07.320 --> 48:11.040
And I'm up here just like, I just want my family.

48:11.800 --> 48:14.680
But I don't want my family to have to say

48:14.880 --> 48:19.560
what the left wants us to say, to have to say what China wants us to say.

48:19.680 --> 48:23.240
I want to be an American and protect my kids and protect my wife

48:23.360 --> 48:28.280
and raise my kids as Christians and have my wife be a Christian

48:28.560 --> 48:31.640
and innovate and America may rock and roll.

48:31.640 --> 48:36.120
I want to innovate as a creative person and be a successful American.

48:36.320 --> 48:38.480
But all of that had been taken away from me.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.880
So I'm coming back and I'm removing the PSTD right now, right?

48:42.880 --> 48:46.320
I'm standing up and saying the only way that we're going to be able to get past

48:46.320 --> 48:51.960
this and the way God is going to use me right now is for me to stop

48:51.960 --> 48:56.640
talking about the pain, stop talking about what happened and do something about it.

48:56.720 --> 48:59.560
And that's where I'm at right now in this moment.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.520
Like, yeah, people agree.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.440
At least there was something we could say.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.120
He has a reason of why he got to that tweet.

49:06.440 --> 49:08.360
And what you're doing for me today is saying,

49:09.960 --> 49:12.960
you know, that was a sorry apology.

49:12.960 --> 49:14.520
And let's specify.

49:14.520 --> 49:19.560
I'm not asking for anyone out here to empathize or sympathize

49:19.920 --> 49:25.720
for a, you know, a dude worth 11 billion dollars that can make money disappear.

49:25.720 --> 49:29.760
I mean, appear at a thin air and five different industries.

49:30.080 --> 49:33.640
You know, I'm not asking for the I'm not asking anybody to sympathize

49:33.640 --> 49:38.120
with someone who's married to Kim Kardashian, dated Irina Shayk.

49:38.800 --> 49:44.040
Like, I feel like I'm just not going to get the sympathy vote in this situation.

49:44.320 --> 49:47.240
Right. So I feel your pain.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.800
I feel like no one's going to feel my pain.

49:49.800 --> 49:54.160
Only only Brad and Leo can feel my pain. Right. So the so.

49:55.560 --> 49:58.880
But still, but here today, when you said as a sorry apology,

49:59.800 --> 50:07.040
what's the what's the apology that you're looking for as a as a Jewish engineer?

50:07.360 --> 50:13.000
And I say as Lex, let's not talk about you being Jewish as Lex.

50:13.000 --> 50:18.520
What's the apology that you want me to say to?

50:18.920 --> 50:20.640
Am I allowed to say Jewish?

50:20.640 --> 50:23.560
Tell me, is it anti-Semitic for you to say Jewish out loud?

50:23.880 --> 50:28.320
No, there's I don't like the allowed that presumes censorship.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.200
I think you choose.

50:30.200 --> 50:31.560
You have a powerful voice.

50:31.560 --> 50:35.480
Did I prove did I did I prove that there was censorship over the past two weeks?

50:35.840 --> 50:38.160
I proved you. Oh, drink champs.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.440
Who? Oh, my Lord.

50:41.520 --> 50:44.840
Oh, like Twitter and so on Twitter that has less to do.

50:44.840 --> 50:47.880
Drink champs that hurt you that drink champs

50:49.280 --> 50:51.880
that nor took it down, took down your conversation.

50:53.720 --> 50:55.440
It didn't hurt you.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.800
Man, you got to be honest about the free

50:58.800 --> 51:01.600
with still the kids we used to be.

51:02.320 --> 51:08.080
I put my hand on the stove to see if I still bleed

51:08.720 --> 51:11.040
and nothing hurts anymore.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.440
I feel kind of free.

51:14.720 --> 51:18.200
No, do you think?

51:18.920 --> 51:22.960
You know, I I went to Japan for two to three months, right?

51:23.760 --> 51:27.200
The day I had Sunday service,

51:27.560 --> 51:31.760
my kids are supposed to be there and my kids would know where to be found.

51:32.280 --> 51:35.560
And I text Kim and say, where are my kids?

51:36.080 --> 51:38.440
We get into an argument.

51:38.440 --> 51:42.160
And then I get a text from a number I don't know.

51:42.560 --> 51:46.960
And it's Pete Davidson bragging about being in bed with my wife.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.200
Then.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.160
Just fucking with you.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.400
Well, at that point, it's like.

51:55.400 --> 51:58.800
They're trying to put me in jail or put a friend of mine in jail.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
Because then I'm going to go

52:02.320 --> 52:06.800
surround the hotel and do all, you know, do something

52:06.800 --> 52:09.480
which would have me not be able to be here.

52:09.880 --> 52:12.240
And instead, I walked away from that situation.

52:12.240 --> 52:15.040
I went to Japan like the samurai that I am

52:15.480 --> 52:17.440
and went to the top of the mountain.

52:17.440 --> 52:22.120
And because I knew that, I mean, I knew there was no way

52:22.760 --> 52:26.760
she could love this dude, not just because he's ugly.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.280
He's not black. She likes black guys.

52:28.280 --> 52:32.040
Every guy that she, you know, is with looks exactly the same.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.480
Ray J, Reggie Bush.

52:35.040 --> 52:38.880
At that time, Kanye West, she has a type, just like how I have a type.

52:38.880 --> 52:41.720
Like a lot of my girls look kind of similar to her because in a video game

52:41.720 --> 52:44.560
character, people have people have their type, right?

52:44.560 --> 52:47.160
So I knew that this is the type of guy that she is.

52:47.160 --> 52:51.480
That this was like the princess has a type and she likes Mario.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.440
Right. There you go.

52:53.440 --> 52:56.600
As somebody cares for you and hopefully can be a friend.

52:57.360 --> 53:01.800
Yeah, I got to say these words and the words about Jews

53:02.480 --> 53:05.160
is not the words of a samurai,

53:06.000 --> 53:07.640
of a great man.

53:07.640 --> 53:10.240
I would say, you know, you said.

53:11.680 --> 53:14.480
Something that inspired that resonated with a lot of people

53:14.480 --> 53:17.360
when you said George Bush doesn't care about black people.

53:18.080 --> 53:21.880
I have to say, as somebody who cares for you, that, yay,

53:22.440 --> 53:28.400
the artist formerly known as Kanye West doesn't care about Jewish people.

53:29.080 --> 53:33.600
In the same way you spoke about George Bush being a politician

53:33.760 --> 53:38.160
and not giving a fuck about the poor people that suffered after Katrina,

53:38.640 --> 53:42.280
you're not giving a fuck about the suffering of the Jewish people

53:42.280 --> 53:44.440
across the world. Why am I not?

53:45.080 --> 53:49.680
Because you're feeding, you're giving strength, motivation.

53:49.840 --> 53:53.080
We already updated. I gave an apology. You said it wasn't good enough.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.040
Yeah, that's right. It's not you're telling me.

53:55.040 --> 53:56.080
No, I'm not going to.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.040
You don't need to kiss anyone's dick.

53:58.040 --> 54:02.520
Well, yeah, do you have to say it was wrong to say there is no Jewish media?

54:02.640 --> 54:04.880
There's no Jewish. There isn't.

54:05.080 --> 54:10.000
There's no control of the media by Jewish engineer, brother.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.640
If you're an engineer and you're not holding to the truth,

54:12.640 --> 54:13.760
that's not engineering.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.600
Engineering is not that's not that doesn't that's hate.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.400
That's engineering.

54:18.400 --> 54:22.080
You know, I'm going to build a better record label.

54:22.120 --> 54:25.720
It's called and I'm going to respect our stereotypes exist for a reason.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.520
Engineers don't do stereotypes.

54:27.520 --> 54:29.000
I do. Types are dumb.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.440
They allow you to channel hate towards the other.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.920
You know what the biggest thing is? Yeah.

54:34.920 --> 54:38.760
With something, a veteran that was sitting next to me,

54:38.760 --> 54:42.000
a cheesecake factory last night, he said,

54:43.520 --> 54:48.360
you know, the general justice, he serves for whoever is the president.

54:48.840 --> 54:52.960
Right. And he said, what's happening in politics is

54:54.080 --> 54:57.120
we're forgetting we're on the same side.

54:57.120 --> 55:01.200
We're forgetting this is someone is practically now he's a nurse.

55:01.240 --> 55:04.920
So he's still, you know, fighting for humanity in a way.

55:04.960 --> 55:08.520
He went from holding, you know, guns in battle

55:08.520 --> 55:13.800
to being a nurse and when people are battling for their lives.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.480
And he said, we're forgetting we're on the same side.

55:18.960 --> 55:24.400
This is a person that no matter who becomes president,

55:24.520 --> 55:27.040
he can still be told to go to war.

55:28.040 --> 55:32.000
And the chaos that's created by the media

55:32.920 --> 55:36.560
has split the country in half.

55:36.920 --> 55:41.520
And what we what us as beings with an engineer opportunity

55:41.520 --> 55:44.920
need to do right now is find the blue water.

55:45.520 --> 55:49.080
Where do we where are places that we agree on?

55:49.520 --> 55:52.600
And I want you to finish everything.

55:53.000 --> 56:00.760
Hey, I'm a let you finish everything that you want to express to me.

56:01.080 --> 56:04.000
Get off all I'm your I'm your scarecrow today.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.720
I'm your I'm your punching bag today for everything I did.

56:06.960 --> 56:10.920
And I want you to stand up for all of the hate that I'm your Al Gore.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.640
When he lost the election.

56:12.640 --> 56:17.800
Remember, he almost became a punching bag for the lady that had voted on him.

56:18.120 --> 56:19.600
And she just said all this stuff.

56:19.600 --> 56:22.240
And he's like, I know, I agree with you. Right.

56:22.520 --> 56:26.720
But there's nothing, you know, that he could do about it with this.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.600
It's like things that you're saying.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.040
I agree with you.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.440
You know, it's like if you sit some kids in the

56:33.360 --> 56:35.880
in the principal's office and I punch somebody, right.

56:36.120 --> 56:40.040
I took I took my hand right as.

56:41.640 --> 56:45.800
What it really means, even Ari Emmanuel had to say, this is a pop icon.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.240
Right. And I went and just punched.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.320
An entire people at one time or said that I was about to I went like this.

56:56.960 --> 57:00.520
Right. And I got blacked out, black mirrored, done.

57:00.520 --> 57:02.800
Right. And it's like, what were you even going to do?

57:02.920 --> 57:05.640
And why did you go like this?

57:05.640 --> 57:09.040
I went like this because.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.480
I can't even I would I would look insane to physically show you

57:16.680 --> 57:21.520
a metaphor, a physical representation

57:21.920 --> 57:25.480
of my last 20 years of what I've been through

57:26.120 --> 57:29.600
as a musician, as a father

57:29.960 --> 57:32.240
and as a black person with a political opinion.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.920
A great man still through the pain does the right thing.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.960
And I think the right thing

57:37.960 --> 57:41.560
is to not say that there's Jewish control of the media.

57:41.680 --> 57:42.880
And that's incorrect, though.

57:42.880 --> 57:45.000
That's a fucking lie. There is.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.520
And they did come and bully me and prove the point.

57:47.600 --> 57:50.080
Now, the reason you don't say it

57:50.080 --> 57:54.160
is because the world is much bigger than the forgive me,

57:54.240 --> 57:56.880
the narrow little world you exist in.

57:57.200 --> 58:02.160
Your impact stretches way past those little boardroom meetings over contracts.

58:02.160 --> 58:04.240
So what should I have done? What should I have done?

58:04.240 --> 58:07.160
Not say that you should be a strong man that doesn't mention

58:07.520 --> 58:10.360
that doesn't mention religion or people and then fight.

58:10.800 --> 58:13.600
Do you want to win this fight? I win. How do we win?

58:13.640 --> 58:15.680
Call out individual people built.

58:15.680 --> 58:17.480
That's one way because they have a big voice.

58:17.480 --> 58:21.440
The other voice that I prefer is to build another label.

58:21.520 --> 58:26.920
I feel like you're controlling my creative narrative and my

58:27.160 --> 58:29.440
because just like how you're telling me, I shouldn't have said that.

58:29.720 --> 58:32.040
Do you think there are people telling me I shouldn't have wore a red hat?

58:34.000 --> 58:37.280
No, because you asked me, what should I have done?

58:37.360 --> 58:39.160
You're supposed to be a scarecrow.

58:39.160 --> 58:42.160
So I thought I'm going to beat the shit out of the scarecrow with my words.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.960
Right. You let me. Yeah, it was consensual.

58:45.160 --> 58:47.640
The punching bag is a bad because scarecrow actually has a different.

58:47.760 --> 58:50.000
Yeah, that's right. I'm like, let's say a punching bag.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.920
I said scarecrow. Yeah.

58:51.920 --> 58:55.720
But every single person that I've sat with from the point

58:55.720 --> 58:58.680
when I wore the red hat to now has done the same thing.

58:59.080 --> 59:02.960
Sit in the principal's office and don't do what you're doing.

59:03.360 --> 59:05.440
We're in the generous closet right now together.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.040
And I'm not. The red hat is very different.

59:08.240 --> 59:12.440
The red hat is a you have a set of beliefs.

59:12.480 --> 59:17.360
You represent half the country that has a hope,

59:17.760 --> 59:19.760
a vision for the future of America.

59:19.760 --> 59:23.000
That's very different than without any purpose whatsoever.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.440
Saying Jewish media, Jewish control of the media.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.520
You said there's there's no purpose.

59:27.520 --> 59:31.720
So you're taking away my history and my reason of what my purpose was.

59:33.120 --> 59:39.120
I'm saying also, also, also, I'm speaking my voice, vocalize.

59:39.120 --> 59:42.360
Also, yeah, it's God's plan.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.400
There's a lot of things that open up.

59:44.400 --> 59:45.440
Let me tell you something that open up.

59:45.440 --> 59:49.160
There's a guy, like I told you, that was running stem player

59:49.520 --> 59:50.880
who I've had issues with.

59:50.880 --> 59:53.280
We hadn't got paid on certain things. Right.

59:53.680 --> 59:59.640
And he took his his IQ, his know how his engineering know how to.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:04.640
He basically was trying to adidas me with even though I was the bigger money

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.400
in the situation that was fun and we funded together.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.200
And he hired these engineers and he said, well, because of your comments,

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.440
we're not going to be able to hire anybody else.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.320
And I was like, well, how many Jewish people do we have in our company?

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.480
He said, I don't know.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.320
He didn't say exactly. Right.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.640
I said, do we have black people?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.040
We said, yes.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.880
That's then how many said two.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:29.480
So we have like 60 full time employees, like 40 half time and part time.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.160
And I.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.440
I took as a responsibility.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:42.120
Let's let's let's let's take a step back from the us being one species and say,

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.520
hey, you're Jewish. I'm black. Right.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.040
Why step back for this example, for the sake of this example?

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.160
And I said, wow.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.560
I'm sure I can hire more than two black engineers.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.920
And what happens is because there are so many businessmen

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.400
that just so happen to be Jewish that it's good business, right, just to monopolize.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.920
That's what people are looking. Everybody wants to be Elon. Right.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.320
So the I disagree with that.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.360
OK, well, let me finish this point.

01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.080
I'll let you finish a lot of what you finish.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.880
A lot of a lot of businessmen want to be as successful as Elon

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.040
and as popular as Elon, a lot like just worded like that,

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.080
which I hate the term a lot, actually.

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:29.560
I want to be more specific, but I don't.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.240
I haven't done the math on it.

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:34.400
Let's say some factually, for sure.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.160
There are some business people of all different walks and backgrounds

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:42.720
that would like to be as rich and as popular as Elon Musk.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:47.520
So let me just take a step back from the we're one species into the

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:52.360
we're separated by race, gender, socioeconomic class conversation

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:57.320
and say as a black owner of two tech platforms, hardware and software,

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.000
I need to take action.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.960
Let's not call it affirmative.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.440
Let's just say I need to take action

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:09.360
and I need to take accountability and ensuring

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.880
that black engineers

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.200
are hired and guess what? Hired together.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.080
Because when the black people that are brilliant

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.360
are separated from our culture, we forget who we are.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.520
And we'll get to a point where, you know,

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.800
OJ will say I'm not black, I'm OJ.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.560
Because just to be on the golf course, we put on the golf shirt.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.080
But the golf shirt might not be something that our culture would have done.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.200
And now our culture in poor communities is,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.120
oh, everybody's got Draco on them.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.040
Everybody's got a gun on them.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.480
Oh, if you run up on me on the gas station, I'm going to kill you.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:58.160
Hey, you ain't got to talk to me like a man if I haven't killed

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.080
at least five people.

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.360
But you know what happens is we can kill five people.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.960
We could kill ten people and still be in the media

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.720
as long as we play by the rules.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.880
Right. Because what will happen is any of these guys

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:14.760
that have talked about killing people and different things,

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.920
unless Trump had pardoned them. Right.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.160
But let's say even if Trump had pardoned them,

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:24.000
they could still go to someone like a little boozy or Meek Mills

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.560
or Puff Daddy, anybody, and say, hey, we need you to talk shit about.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.200
Yay. Right now.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.480
And also, you're not allowed if you do want to vote for Trump

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.200
or vote outside of what this arrangement is,

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.720
then we're going to put you in jail.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.480
It ain't that we're not going to bring you down.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.920
We have this on you.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.600
You get I'm saying if I had ever killed someone,

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.040
if I wasn't the bitch with the pink polo on,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:56.440
I wouldn't be able to be the vocal man that I am today.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:57.800
You understand what I'm saying?

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.880
This is the reason why I'm happy that my gangster disciple brothers

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.560
kept me from the initiations, which made me feel like a pussy

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.200
my whole life. Right.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.520
But now I am someone who legally can say this.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.440
Other people in my position, they legally cannot speak.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:24.640
They legally cannot speak or they will go to prison.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.480
I am in a bit of a glass prison because I don't have say so

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:32.880
of where my children go to school.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.040
But I'm in a freedom place where I can have this conversation with you right now.

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:41.520
And that is I don't like the word breakthrough.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.120
You know, that's God's hand on this situation.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.600
But you get what I'm saying about if I hadn't said the tweet,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.600
I wouldn't have had to take the accountability myself

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.600
to hire black engineers into my two tech platforms.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.920
And do you get what I'm saying?

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.120
That's a beautiful personal journey you're on.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.640
But do you get what I'm saying?

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.920
That personal is for my people as a whole, as a small company,

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:07.760
as a small company, as a tribal person.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.920
I believe that I am my people.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.480
And the thing that that businessmen have done to my people

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.320
have pulled the brightest out of our tribes and siloed them

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.040
and made us lose our culture and lose who they were.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.800
All the only thing I wanted to say a Virgil's funeral, which I wasn't allowed to.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.280
Right. It was a white pastor that talked the majority of the funeral.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.800
Half the funeral was pissed, pissed. Right.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.440
And and this pastor actually married me and Kim.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.280
Right. It looks like Justin Timberlake a little bit.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.040
And he talked half the funeral.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.560
He knew Virgil was passing,

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.880
did a collaboration with him before he passed, by the way.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.160
Right. A clothing collaboration.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.440
I didn't know Virgil was passing.

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.280
But the thing I wanted to say.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.240
I saw A$AP Rocky and I saw some other members of his gang,

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.840
you know, in the audience at the funeral.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:18.080
And all I wanted to tell him is don't let them split the gang up.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.440
Don't let them split the gang up.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.240
When I did the first Yeezy,

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:32.920
because I did Kanye West two fashion shows before as a high end luxury,

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:37.360
all leather kind of designer, not all leather, but, you know, high end materials.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.960
Mink, this kind of thing.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.480
And then I came back with Yeezy, with Adidas.

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:49.960
And this fashion show was so popular that Justin Bieber had to sit in the second row.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.760
Right. This thing had every name you could think of.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:58.000
It had Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.960
It was Kylie's first fashion show she'd been in.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.160
And in the second fashion show, I put Kylie and Bella Hadid next to each other.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.080
In the fashion show, you had Puff Daddy.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.320
At that time, Puff Daddy had beef with Drake.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:16.360
Drake still came to the show and Yeezy had to break up the fight backstage.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.960
The designers, you had Jerry Lorenzo, that's head of Fear of God.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.560
You had Kim Shrobb, head of Skims.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.880
You have Virgil Abloh, head of Louis Vuitton.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:29.960
You had Demna, head of Balenciaga, all working for Yeezy,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.360
for the leader, for the philosophy.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.800
Yeezy, for the leader, for the philosopher, right?

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.920
For the person that put, who put this together?

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:40.600
Me, that's who, right?

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:46.600
You had these people working for the King of New York, basically the boss, Yeezy, right?

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.920
You had Jay-Z in the audience, Rihanna in the audience,

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.840
Beyoncé in the audience, sitting next to Anna Wintour in this audience.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.440
And guess who heard wind of this?

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.680
One of the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault, caught wind of this.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.600
What's going on?

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.560
They're building up something and we need to stop it.

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:14.840
So then he met with me and politely offered me backing for my clothing line.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.440
It would be Kanye West.

01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.600
They would get 49%, 51%, I would get 49%.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:24.360
They'd have control and they were going to give me all of the support from Louis Vuitton.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.640
So I had to go to Adidas and I told Adidas,

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.240
hey, let's indemnify the apparel.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.440
So Adidas, you're not going to do the apparel anymore.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.040
Hey, we had a good time, but we're going to run off with Giselle now, right?

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.000
So that's like, you told your girl that and she's like,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.280
oh, I know we're supposed to.

01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:43.880
We had the proudest moment of our career.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.240
So then he offers me to deal and Alexander Arnault,

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:55.560
who's went to gone on and rape and pillage from all of the talent that I had afterwards, said,

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:02.440
before I tell Adidas to indemnify the apparel, can I get a written contract from your dad,

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:03.240
Bernard Arnault?

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.000
And he says, my dad will never go back on his word.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.920
So you already know where this thing is going, right?

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.280
You can, spoiler alert, right?

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.360
He went back on his word.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.280
So three months into the deal, I get Anna Winter.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.840
I say, who should I use for my lawyer?

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.080
She picks my lawyer for me, right?

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:27.720
I just found out even a couple of days that the lawyer demanded an airplane during negotiations.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:30.120
Had nothing to do with me, right?

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.440
They said that Bernard Arnault got freaked out.

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:37.000
And then Alexander Arnault calls me and says, the deal got dropped at the board.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:45.160
I went back and told my high maintenance wife, I was supposed to become this designer at Louis Vuitton

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.960
or the Louis Vuitton group was going to back the Kanye West line,

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.960
because that's how good I've done in fashion, babe.

01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.200
And now the deal is dropped.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.520
Now the deal is dropped.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:10:00.760
So then I did a second collection and we didn't have any support to be able to build the collection.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.240
Then I went and found a third collection.

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:03.800
We did it.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.720
We took over MSG.

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.280
Fourth collection went and the show started an hour late.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.320
Then a week later, Kim got robbed.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.560
Then I told Scooter Braun, my manager at that time, I say,

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:21.800
I need to go to Japan.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.840
I'm tired.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:23.320
I'm tired.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.400
He says, no, you need to make more money.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.160
I do four more shows on a second leg of the tour.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.400
And I suffer from exhaustion and go to the hospital.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.160
And then get diagnosed with a disorder.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:42.600
This is the first time I ever suffered from exhaustion.

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:45.080
By the way, I haven't been to the hospital since.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:54.280
I haven't been to the hospital since and haven't taken medication in two years.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.800
And I'm sure there'll be people in the media, we won't say,

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.640
where phone will say, well, that's obvious.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.480
So right now I'm talking to you.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360
I'm not on medication.

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:08.040
I just go to sleep.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:08.840
I have sleep.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:09.960
Have you been able to sleep?

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.280
That's too low hanging fruit for you.

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.440
You're more, I expect more.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.080
I agree.

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:17.640
I expect more.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:17.960
I agree.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.440
That was dumb.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.000
I regret it.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.280
It's not what I said.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:24.280
That's like Pierce Morgan trying to grab ratings.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.960
You got a whole life ahead of you.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.160
You got a whole life ahead of you.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:29.800
These guys are at the end of their life.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.520
Oh, good.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:32.600
So this story is-

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.720
Call me out on my shit.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.680
I love it.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:40.920
But then, amidst that, the same guy that dropped my deal, Bernard Arnaud,

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:42.600
goes and hires my best friend.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:45.720
Goes and hires my main engineer, right?

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:52.600
It would have been like them hiring Elon from Peter before they figured out Paul,

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.600
before they figured out PayPal.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.400
But it don't, Paul, it sounds like, Paul sounds like Paul.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.360
I just said it because I'm a Christian.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.240
I thought it was cool.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:05.480
But it would have been like, what if someone could have went in and took Elon away from

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:08.840
Peter before they paid Paul, before they-

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.280
I just could say PayPal.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.880
Before they figured out.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:13.160
Yeah, before they paid Paul.

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.200
Before they-

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.160
It's just too close.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:15.800
Yeah, too close.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.360
It just sounds so fresh that the fact that it's so close, right?

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.840
And that's what happened, right?

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.000
They broke the gang up.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.480
And I'm telling you right now, that hadn't happened.

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.840
Virgil's alive.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.800
I'm still married.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.360
You know what I'm saying?

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.960
The power structure was broken then, right?

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:35.080
Because we were building some-

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:37.400
Kylie wasn't a billionaire, you know what I mean?

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:44.680
We were building something together that a French colonizer came in and caught it early

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.920
and tried to destroy it.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.800
But the only thing is God is alive and I'm anointed.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:58.280
And even with those drawbacks, losing my wife, losing my friend, exhaustion,

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:04.040
all of these late night tweets that piss off an entire group, you know, like this,

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:08.280
the frustration still there.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.320
We work, I work for God and God runs the world and we'll see what happens.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.000
But in those words, don't you feel that being split up,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.560
don't you feel you're doing the thing that you stand against, which is playing victim?

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.400
Aren't you playing victim to the forces in the world?

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:29.960
I didn't play victim.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.320
I didn't even get a chance to play.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.680
I just said I was about to.

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:34.280
I said like this, like-

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.200
No, you played pretty damn well.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.080
What do you mean?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080
What do you mean about to?

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.920
You're like one of the greatest designers in history, fashion designers.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:44.680
You're playing.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.280
You are playing.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.160
What does that even mean?

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.600
I thought you were referring to the tweet.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.360
All of them.

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.240
There's a full set of things that you're under attack for,

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.480
the tweet and everything beyond that.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:05.880
But like you're blaming, not blaming, but you're saying that the Jewish media,

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:12.040
the Jewish regulators, the Jewish people, forget Jewish or not, it doesn't matter.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.120
It's playing victim, right?

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:19.960
Ultimately, I am fighting a battle in the spiritual form.

01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.040
And anyone that believes in God and is looking at this interview would agree with that.

01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.720
And I just so happen to be a bright part of God's army.

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.760
I'm fighting for us to live.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:35.000
The greatest gift is life itself.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.680
I am pro-life.

01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.680
I am pro-God.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:44.600
I believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and died for our sins.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.320
What do you feel about another attack, another painful thing?

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.520
I imagine super painful is Balenciaga pulling.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.200
You had a really close relationship and friendship with their creative director.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.200
How do you feel about all of it?

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:09.880
I told you I sang the song.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.480
I sing another song from one of my mentor's future.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.240
I never feel pain.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.240
I didn't feel too much pain.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.560
There was a day where I was headed to Nashville to meet with George Farmer,

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.440
who is the CEO of Parla, the day when we made the announcement.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:36.440
At that same day, Balenciaga was taking my imagery off of their site.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.080
And the drink champs was being taken down.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.760
And I said, this is the happiest day of my life.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.560
I love cutting the grass low.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.120
People wasn't really with you.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.400
They was part-time.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.000
People switch up when it's wartime.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:59.720
I'd rather have people who are really with me and not people who are just trying to use me.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:03.240
Listen, as a friend, somebody cares for you.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:08.040
You have to be really careful by the people, by all people, always.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:12.680
The people that are going to try to be close to you now, you don't know if you can trust them.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.920
With the Balenciaga, I have more to say about it, though.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:15.420
Yeah.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.480
Let's do this.

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:24.120
Demna will still work for you someday.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.080
And this is just speeding the process up.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.680
Have you talked?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:30.280
Can you share if you've talked?

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.840
Yes, I talked to Demna.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.440
We're kindred spirits.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.760
None of this can keep us away from each other.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.320
I brought Demna to Gap.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:45.720
I brought Demna to Gap to be able to bring the best product in the world.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.880
At that time, I wanted to go under $100.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.120
Now, I'm like, okay, we're going to go $20 a product.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:57.640
I brought Demna in to engineer.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.400
That's why I said engineer by Balenciaga, Easy Gap engineer by Balenciaga,

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.440
to engineer the best product for the people.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:14.280
The people that they say are at the bottom of the Maslow hierarchy and need chart.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:16.680
They're at the bottom of the pyramid.

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.560
Gap didn't want that.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.640
Balenciaga didn't want that.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.760
Our genders were not aligned.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.120
I was brought in to the Gap for political reasons and influence,

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.520
like a Virgil, like a George Floyd.

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:38.840
When popular celebrities are brought into Fortune 500 companies,

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:40.360
it's not to raise the stock.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.760
It's to strengthen the position and influence.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:51.640
It's definitely not to be out here letting a nigga think he's Steve Jobs.

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.160
Yeah, there's people like that.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:01.960
But you, as a great man, a visionary,

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.600
your job is to understand that game and be one step ahead.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.920
Well, that's why I'm telling them that relationship,

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.760
some relationships only last for a summer.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.720
Some last for a year.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.160
The relationship ran its course.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:27.800
You know, in that relationship, I invested a lot of my social capital and actual capital.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:33.160
I spent somewhere between $5 to $10 million, personally, on Balenciaga.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.720
How much money do you think Balenciaga had paid me in the past two years?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.880
Just take a really wild guess, a really wild-

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:42.600
Less than that.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.160
Just take a super wild one.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.640
Just go to the furthest extent of your imagination.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:53.000
$1.2 million.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:54.840
Lower.

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.880
$500,000.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:58.280
Lower.

01:18:59.480 --> 01:18:59.880
Zero.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:09.160
And actually, two weeks ago, I paid at a saint's account $862,000.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:16.040
Not in clothes, for me, from Balenciaga, from the store, in royalties to Balenciaga,

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.840
where the deal had been engineered, where I was coming out of my pocket.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:31.080
So I paid, last year I paid Demna $3 million to design the collection, right?

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:39.000
And we got it out of the Gap Marketing Fund, and he was going to deliver 160 skews or 120 skews.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:45.880
100 skews are separate items of clothing, styles of clothing.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.080
So he ended up delivering about 60.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.520
I feel like we're on the people's court because we actually are, right?

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.800
We're in the court of public opinion.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.760
So he delivered about 60.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.680
There were all kinds of people that were working-

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:04.120
Part of the reason why I had to get Demna, I didn't want to have to get-

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.400
I wanted to compete with him.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:07.640
I didn't want to have to get him.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:13.560
When I made Stronger, I did it to compete with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake,

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.120
because my fiance at that time liked Justin Timberlake just a little bit too much.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.440
So I made it to compete.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.440
And then we had the song out.

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:23.640
It's number one on Apple.

01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.760
It's blowing up.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.080
I play it in a club and it sounds muddy.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.560
It doesn't sound the way Sexy Back sounded in the club.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:42.680
So I go to Pharrell Williams to do the drums and it sounds like a different record.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.920
I know it can't be a different record because I'm going to swap it out on radio, right?

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.240
Then I go to Swiss Beats.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.680
It sounds like a different record.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:21:00.760
I go to Timbaland, the person who did Sexy Back, and he did it in five minutes

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.240
and then spent the rest of the hour talking about how nobody could have done it except for him,

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.320
running around the studio.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.280
I'm the best.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.080
No one could have done it.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.120
That's why he had to go to me.

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.560
He had to go to the king.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:13.240
Well, he had a point, right?

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.440
He had a point, right?

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.760
What makes the song muddy?

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:17.400
Is it the beat?

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.680
It was in the drums.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.840
It was something that Timbaland had in those drums.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.960
Now watch this.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.440
I said I'm going Defqon3, right?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:29.720
And the actual- I spelled it wrong.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.680
I have a tendency to do that.

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:35.800
I'm not quite John Legend, tight sweater level, spelling bee level.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:42.360
I feel a parallel to me going to Timbaland to when I said,

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:47.480
hey, you as an engineer, I need to work with you as an engineer that is Jewish

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:53.560
to look at these contracts and what my people, not just Black people,

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:56.840
let's say artists, are dealing with in our contracts.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.600
These contracts need to be fixed.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:03.160
Everyone could be so mad at the messenger, right?

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:04.840
Yay, you said it the wrong way.

01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:07.320
You're offensive.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:10.200
You're like Hitler now because you said it.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:15.000
You said this out loud, but it does not- you weren't getting enough sleep.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:22.520
All this shit does not negate the fact that we do have- Houston, we have a problem.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.120
Yeah, but we is just the music industry.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.600
Like, there's a lot of hate that was created by just saying that, you know?

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.800
But you're saying what is just is everything to me, right?

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:37.800
One person can mean everything to me, right?

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.360
And for George Bush, winning an election was everything.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.240
And then when you said George Bush doesn't care about Black people,

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.960
that you woke him up.

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.800
You woke the people up to the fact that he was narrowly being selfish.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.400
There's a sense to which you're being corrupted by your own greatness.

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.360
You're focusing too much on the industry that you've made great,

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.520
that you've rose to the very top.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.000
One of the richest artists in history, one of the greatest designers-

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.440
I'm not- I am the richest artist in history.

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:11.560
Probably the richest artist in history.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.840
The funny thing is they're like, oh, rich is Black people.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:22.120
It's like, oh, also, richest actor, richest musician, richest fashion designer.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.440
Like, there's a bunch of riches in that one.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.080
You know what I'm saying?

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:30.280
It's like richer than Ralph Lauren, like richer than Armani, like richest, like of that.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.000
But still low, because where do you put that, you know, like on the totem?

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.160
Because I don't even want to-

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:39.000
Man's bank account isn't everything.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:44.600
I would say you and I are equal in a certain deep sense.

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.120
No matter what the bank account says.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:57.400
So I wanted to give you some theme music for your moments.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.360
It sounded a little muddy.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:23:59.800
Let me give you the Timberland version.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:01.960
Thank you.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:03.160
Okay.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.120
Play that at the club.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.480
So the other thing about like, say like Balenciaga is

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:11.880
Demna will work with Ye someday.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:23.800
For Cedric and for Francois Pinot and Salma is a beautiful human being.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:35.000
Five years from now, you'll hear and know the name Ye and know things that we did.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.440
And Balenciaga is not going to make it onto your questions.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.680
Would you, as a gambling man, would you bet on that?

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:45.480
I will bet on that.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.520
I can see it in your eyes.

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.120
Let me ask you a-

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.160
So it was sad.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.400
It was actually a sad day for me, not for me, but more for Balenciaga.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.680
When I heard that, I was just like, oh, shame.

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.600
Let me ask you a silly question just about Demna.

01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.320
I read something that you two talked about, like buttons for a few hours.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:11.480
They're my gumdrop buttons.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.600
Just in that accent.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.040
Me and Demna only speak in Shrek.

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:19.800
What's your philosophy with which you approach design?

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.160
You are one of the great fashion designers of our time.

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.760
How do you think about it?

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.800
Do you have a philosophy?

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:35.400
You know what I like about the zipper is the zipper hoodie replaces the dress shirt

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:42.520
because you could get on your douchebag and unzip it and give it a little bit of that type of look.

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.920
Which is the douchebag?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.040
The douchebags that go to Vegas unbutton their dress shirt.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:58.680
The problem with the pullover hoodie is you can't do the douchebag thing where you unbutton it,

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:02.920
but then still get the stomach because the thing is the ultimate look would be like

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:10.520
military tank pullover hoodie and if you get a little hot, you take off the hoodie,

01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.440
but you're crazy in shape.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:15.400
So it gives you that flexibility.

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:21.880
Yeah, the zipper is giving some flexibility and it's like maybe you want to keep your jacket on.

01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.360
Let's consider a hoodie to be like a jacket.

01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:31.080
If you want to keep your jacket on, then you might want to do this as opposed to pulling it

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:31.560
all the way off.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:36.680
And it's just comfort, but then you get, okay,

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.320
can I do a jogging pant on this with elasticity?

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:47.400
Now, people argue about climate, where we are with the climate, I take a responsibility as

01:26:47.400 --> 01:27:00.840
being the most influential designer of all time to say we're going to use biodegradable clothing.

01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:10.840
Now, the issue there is the elastic is not biodegradable.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:19.640
So that means it's actually better to use jeans and a belt than to have an elastic waistband

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.240
because the elastic waistband is not biodegradable.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:36.680
So I use the planet as a big, the future of the planet is a big piece of the way I engineer

01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.560
and the way we talk about where designs are going.

01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.600
The constraints on your design and engineering is given by the planet, by the future of the planet.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:49.000
Yes. That could almost make Jewish people like me again.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.600
Every time you say Jewish people, I think I've been maybe reading a little too much about

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:04.280
World War II, but man, I recommend you listen to some audiobooks or read some books on the Holocaust

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:12.760
because like, it's heavy, it's heavy, it will put into context, would you impact of your words?

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:15.880
Would you read books on the current Holocaust that

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.720
would you read books on the current Holocaust that black people are in?

01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:24.440
What have you read about abortion?

01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:30.120
I've read a lot of short form writing and I've listened to a lot of debates

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:37.560
because it's really humbling that the question of when does life begin

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.600
is a really difficult question. For me as an engineer and scientist,

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.480
it's a philosophical question.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.640
I mean, we could just go on population control, not like if abortion is right or wrong.

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:58.920
We could say factually, the clinics were made by eugenics for population control,

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:05.480
and it is controlling the population as is the never being given a 40 acres and a mule,

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:09.400
so you don't have the opportunity. And when the people that do have the opportunity

01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:14.680
are separated from our people, our tribe and placed in suburban communities next to us,

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:21.560
Chris Rocco put it, the dentist, and whitewashed and made to shut the fuck up and vote left or

01:29:21.560 --> 01:29:30.680
whatever niggas are supposed to do when we make it, as opposed to saying, okay, we're building

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:38.680
schools, we're building up choirs, we're building up our own leagues, basketball teams,

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:46.920
our own factories. We started the first sportswear factory in America since World War II

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:57.720
was actually this factory I put in Cody. I'm 45 years old. We're on this journey right now.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:03.800
It's the other thing about this is people just in general, they love me so much. I'm actually a hard

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:09.720
guy to really hate for a long period of time because of my huge cock.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.760
That's what I noticed. I didn't understand why you showed it to me when we first met,

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:21.640
but now I understand. It's very nice. Congratulations. I know you don't talk

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:28.840
about it, but your hat does say 24. If you run for president, what kind of ideas would you represent?

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:38.360
That we're beings with engineering opportunities. I would represent

01:30:38.360 --> 01:31:05.080
just as you served the platform here. There's something that happened on my last run that

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:14.360
I thought, I feel, I know was brilliant. It was noisy, but it was brilliant. I had one rally,

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:22.440
and in the rally, I just let people come up and I gave them a platform. It's our responsibility

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:33.000
to listen to the pain and hear the pain and understand even when we're the ones that cause

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:40.040
the pain, like with my tweet. It's my responsibility to hear you and understand

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:46.120
why you feel like that, but it's our responsibility as a people to understand each other,

01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:58.520
to give people a voice. People need the voice, and even right now, what I'm doing or how God is using

01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:07.080
me, I'm showing where our voices are being muted. There's professors that are actually intelligent,

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:14.760
actually have multiple degrees that have been canceled from their schools, and they don't have

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:22.360
a music industry or a fan base or shoe design or a smoking hot ex-wife to complain about.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:27.960
They've just got the truth of what they saw and what they dedicated to this country

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:35.400
and to education that has been muted by schools that have been taken over with an agenda.

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:42.520
You want the brightest minds to be these professors, and then you mute them, and they

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:50.040
have nowhere to go. You might get a guy now that went from being someone's favorite professor

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:56.120
to he's working at Starbucks like he was back in school or like he was back in high school.

01:32:57.080 --> 01:33:01.960
So even if that voice is about anger and hate, it still deserves to be heard.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:10.280
Yeah, it deserves to be heard, and we deserve to ask why. You have to ask why. I just feel like

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:19.080
that's what's... I feel like that is sympathizing, Mr. Hugecock. I'm just saying that it just needs

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:26.680
to be... You should change that name on Twitter while you're still allowed on there.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:32.280
Yeah. Do you think that would get censored? I feel like they definitely cut it down some inches.

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:41.720
I'm pointing out this truth. No, I'm serious. This is not a Christian thing.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:54.280
Right? I wonder right there, when I say these jokes, is it something that... Because I do

01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:02.920
feel like laughter is the key. Engineering and laughter is the key to peace. When I go

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:11.000
get my teeth cleaned and I have the nitrous, there's something that I want to go and hug,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.360
Chris Jenner. I want to go and hug Corey Gamble. I want to go and hug Howard Stern. No one wants

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:22.600
to hug Howard Stern, but just if one... No, no, no. I would love to see you two hug it out

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.200
and make up, even though all this shit talking back and forth. What about talking it out or is

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.800
he going to be screaming at me? Yeah, judgmental and that kind of stuff. No, I hope there's love

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:45.720
there. The thing is, I think Howard's just jealous. Not just jealous of my cock. He's also...

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.000
He's jealous that I started my campaign earlier than him.

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:56.440
You got to let go of that jealousy. You got to let go of that jealousy, Howard.

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:00.280
Howard and everybody else. Jealousy is a natural human thing, man.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:06.360
I wonder just as a Christian, when I joke and say this stuff, it's like,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.840
am I being disobedient to God? Because as a boss, I'll talk to

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.360
an employee and I'll be like, why didn't you just listen? Because I've got the bigger plan.

01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:31.640
So it's like me talking to God, were there things that I did in this interview that were disobedient

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:40.360
to God? And for those things, I pray and I repent for anything that I've said that was disobedient

01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:47.160
to God. But humor is not one of them. Joking is... I feel like humor is the way we avoid so much

01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:52.680
suffering in the world. It's like a catalyst for love. It's a way to...

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:57.960
People that have gone through some of the darkest trauma that I've ever met through war,

01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:05.560
I just came back from Ukraine, they're laughing. They're making jokes. That's the best way to deal

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:11.880
with dark times. I don't know what it is about humans. I feel like humor, that's the best way

01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:16.840
to socially engineer a good future, I think, is humor. Not taking shit too seriously. That's

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:22.440
the problem with censorship. One of the things that really suffer is humor. Jokes. Maybe going

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.800
too far in the jokes. You mentioned Anthony Jeselnik. That guy goes hard. That guy goes

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:34.120
really hard and it's great. He crosses all the lines and that's why he's a genius. And that's

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.960
what people feel is refreshing when he does it. I don't know what it is.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:43.560
But then it's hurtful when I do it. But I'll tell you something that was interesting. I'm pretty sure

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:51.960
Anthony doesn't like... Sorry for the assumption, but just most comedians I know didn't vote for

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:58.920
Trump. That's interesting. Not saying there aren't comedians that did, but just the ones I know,

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.760
because I live in California. But they have an appreciation for Trump because of the sense of

01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:07.000
humor. I got to ask you about parlor engineering, because I'm interested about that.

01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:15.560
Hey man, I'm actually trying to hold it together. You're pretty offensive towards a lot.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.640
I'm not looking to be offensive. I really want to bring people together and get these sales done.

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.680
I know, but 100% I see your vision. How do we do that?

01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.920
But somebody who cares... Well, don't say Jewish media and Jewish controlled media.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:31.400
JM.

01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:44.520
It sounds too much like 1930s Nazi Germany that was leading up to the atrocities.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:46.440
He would say JM?

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:56.120
Yeah, he was a brand of JM. That's right. No, it's just the implied, this memeified

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:06.680
prejudice towards a group in a way that's going to lead to hate. I know you don't mean that. I

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.840
know you have love in your heart. That's what I'm trying to...

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:16.040
You know what was the prejudice towards a group that led to hate? BLM. BLM took a black person,

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:28.440
showed his death on camera because, okay, there are examples of us being killed and being killed

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:35.960
on camera, but if it was spread on camera, it was done on purpose by the media because

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:47.240
14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week and it's not spread that much. They, like you said,

01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:57.560
singled out a person, directed everything on that person as the martyr and raised the people that

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:04.200
hadn't had any. We didn't have our 40 acres and a mule. We didn't have a lot of things that black

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:10.680
people have not ever been given. So once we're given just a little bit, like your life matters,

01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:22.280
then we literally like, okay, now we're being hurt. But actually the death toll is up. The city

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:29.240
where this happened, it's completely been turned to a war zone. It's actually something like

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:37.800
Candace Owens can actually specify this better, but it's like its own city or something. They made

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:44.200
it not be a part of the actual state or something. It's like DC and stuff. It's like Washington DC

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:51.480
now and stuff. And that has to be from a government that's got

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:59.640
higher level agenda written all over it. Yeah, they're using the death of an individual. Yeah,

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:06.120
sure. The media are. Not the Jewish media, the media. And that's the media is fucked up. That

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:15.880
machine takes whatever tragedy and pushes it towards whatever narrative that gets more clicks

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:20.440
and views and so on. Sure. And then politicians do the same. They use the media, they influence

01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:32.360
the media to tell a story. This is a simple thing I'll put. I believe that the idea of anti-Semitism

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:47.480
and the closeness of the Holocaust is used by certain individuals in media to not take

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:56.680
accountability for the bad things that are happening. And what's happening is there's a

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:03.000
new frontier, meaning it used to be okay for somebody to be a billionaire. We thought about

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:10.360
a billionaire. A lot of times you think I'm actually being out of shape, 20 years ago,

01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:15.000
30 years ago, like Onassis or something. You thought about it a different way. Now you think

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:21.080
about a billionaire, you think about Elon, think Kim, think Ye. You think it's a new kind of

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:25.960
billionaire. It's not just Soros is a billionaire. It's a new form of billionaire. Well,

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:34.200
right now what I'm calling for the industry is I'm calling the industry out and saying like, hey,

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:41.400
it just so happens that there's been times where I had my lawyer was Jewish, my regulator was

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:47.400
Jewish, but like eight people that basically would collude and talk without me were in groups

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.800
saying, okay, this is what the tour is going to be. This is his next house. And they were making

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:56.200
all these decisions and they're making all this money. And at the end, I was like, I ended my tour

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:00.680
and I don't have the money. And it just so happens that that's the case that what they were. But what

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:07.560
I'm saying is if everyone can say, hey, you can't point out this fact, or we're going to say you're

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:14.520
anti-Semitic and we're going to call you Hitler. I feel that there has to be at least 1% of

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:22.840
safeguarding the ability to screw the artists based on saying it's anti-Semitic by pointing

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:30.920
out that they just so happen to all be Jewish. And I don't think that's anti-Semitism. I just think

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:37.560
that's, hey, this is another thing. Like, okay, the Kardashians, when you hear that, do you think

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:43.080
male or do you think female? You think female. You get what I'm saying? You think this is the

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:50.280
reality. This is why rap works. They're going to make an anti-women thing in a second. And it's

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.280
going to say, well, if you point out that these five women, six women are having a meeting on where

01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:02.120
the Christmas party is and none of the ballplayers or rappers that they have babies with have any say

01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:07.480
so, so that Christmas happened at Courtney's house all eight years when I was there. And it

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:14.200
never happened at anyone else's black family house. Right. If I'm the one that pointed it out,

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.120
they just don't have they don't have their or your anti-Semitic word to say, shut the

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:26.440
fuck up. Yeah, but this is the way it runs. This is the way we want to do it. If you say that though

01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:33.080
that women are silencing the black voice, yes, you're going to get the same response, but

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:40.520
especially if historically resonance the fact that it's true. When you talk in groups

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:47.160
that breeds hate, when you talk about individuals, it solves problems. You're an

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:53.640
engineering. OK, but this is something I pointed out on Pierce. I said if a black person gets pulled

01:43:53.640 --> 01:44:00.440
over with a car and it's three other people in the car, they're also going to jail. They're not going

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:07.000
to single them out. They're going to say you guys are all in collusion. I just described collusion

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:15.720
five times in this interview and you keep on going back to this is like 1930. This is like this. This

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:24.040
is like that. What I'm saying is, look, I want to work with you as an engineer to free my people.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:31.160
Can we start as a being with engineer opportunities right here? I am sorry to the

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:41.400
people who had to be hurt and affected by that. Now we are here and I'm looking to solve it,

01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:46.520
but what happens is every time if I talk to any of these business people one by one,

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.360
because mind you, I didn't get to the tweet by not having a conversation.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:55.640
I had the conversations beforehand before I got to the tweet. Now we're going to take it to the

01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:03.000
stage. Now we're on the world stage and you saw Ari Emanuel do exactly the kind of thing

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.120
that I was saying had been done behind closed doors. Now he's doing it in open doors.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:15.480
They told Candace Owens I couldn't be on the daily wire. You can't even explain yourself

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:20.920
and we don't care how you got to that point either and that's fucked up.

01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.640
They told Candace you can't be on daily wire.

01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:30.280
Yes, she did. That's what they said. You know what? You can have my voice raised or lower.

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:36.840
I'm going to do it lower because what's happening to me by I put in your words, the media is saying,

01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:44.360
not only can you not explain yourself, we don't care how you got to that point,

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.600
you need to apologize and you can't explain and that's the end of the story.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:54.360
So just apologize so we can have Mel Gibson do some more films is exactly what Ari Emanuel

01:45:54.360 --> 01:46:00.920
was saying. No one is looking to change the problem that led so many people to that same

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.240
level of frustration and I just so happen to be the one that's not going to back up on it

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:13.000
until this changes because you know what? I'm sorry I had a sleepy text. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:25.000
I'm sorry that I put that I was 5'12 or 5'11 on Tinder. Okay, my cock is not 14 inches. I lied.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:34.600
Okay, it's only 13. So I'm sorry, right? Why are you dropping so many facts today?

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:39.800
So what I'm saying is, but where do we get to this? Because even you, as engineering,

01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:45.480
as intelligent as you are, you, just like everyone else that I say was colluding,

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:50.760
won't let us get to the point of fixing it. But I'm not, I think you're more powerful than

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:55.800
the media. I'm not saying you need to apologize because the media, I'm saying everything we've

01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:01.560
been talking about just because I care for you and I want you to be the best possible man you can be.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.360
To me, a definition of a great man, I'm with Martin Luther King on this. You don't talk about

01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:11.400
Jews or black people. You talk about engineering. You talk about humanity. You solve problems.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:15.720
You identify the problems in the world and you don't come from a place of resentment.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:21.480
This group did this, this. Fuck all that. That is in the past. You just build solutions.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:25.880
I'm going to create a new record label. I'm going to create a new design firm. I'm going to create

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:29.560
a new social network. I'm going to do it better. I'm going to do it right. I'm going to do it

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.640
right by the people that I know don't have a voice. I'm going to give them a voice and talk

01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:38.600
about that. Is it okay to call out collusion? Do people collude in your business under you,

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.680
like the engineers that come together and say, they collude against the bosses, right?

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.520
You know why Bernardo Noh offered the deal and took it away from me? Collusion. Because I was

01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:53.880
too powerful with the collective that I had right there. He had to stop that at all costs. They said,

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:59.000
for whatever reason, this kid, yay, it has the ability to have all of the Kardashians,

01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:05.560
Jay-Z and Beyonce, Justin Bieber, Demna, Virgil, all these people in the same room,

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:12.600
working towards the same goal. I've been that person since preschool. That's called a leader,

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:21.400
right? And right now, what I'm saying is, hey, for the people in business, whatever their background

01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:27.400
is, whether they turn their cell phones off on Friday or not, there's been some bad business

01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:33.640
done. There's some bad business practices. And we have to change that because this game is like

01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:42.520
boxing. More people end up retarded than rich. And I'm saying beat to a pulp, driven crazy,

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.600
beat by the media to a pulp. Right now, the media has done everything they could

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:54.200
to make me apologize and to make me look crazy. And that one person has done anything to find out

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:59.400
why I was frustrated enough to do that tweet. And that's facts. And that's fucked up.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:06.920
Well, I am finding out. We found out. But I want solutions. See, there's something about human

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:12.360
nature where if you focus too much on resentment... We're not focusing on anymore. Fuck the resentment.

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:17.320
We're moving forward. Right. So there's two things, I think, that are required for... I mean,

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:21.800
this is how I've lived my life, for great engineering. You surround yourself in your

01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:28.200
personal life by people you trust. And then in your professional life, from the engineer

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.640
perspective, with a team, with an incredible team. And everything else doesn't matter. That

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:38.840
allows you not to focus on other groups, how they're fucking you over, how they're trying

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:42.840
to manipulate or collude and all that kind of stuff. You focus on solutions and you find a way

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:48.040
around all the difficult shit. That's it. If you have people in your life you can trust.

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:54.360
That's lifelong. You said some people you're with for the summer, for a year. Find people you can

01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:00.120
be with for your whole life. Do you have people in your life that you trust, really trust?

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:15.000
No, I trust God. At any point, a human being... If I go and really treat this guy like a piece of

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:23.720
shit, or do this, that, am I supposed to trust him to be loyal and stay in the situation? No,

01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:28.680
I trust people to be people. And people are flawed. And people can have the right intentions,

01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:35.160
but it only makes sense for us to work together when our agendas align. When Kim was pulled

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:44.120
really far to the left, our agendas no longer aligned. So that made the marriage

01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.000
impossible. It aligned where it's like, oh, I could wear a red hat that can help her get

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:55.320
Alice Johnson out of jail because Trump's willing to do that for my wife because I was the only

01:50:55.320 --> 01:51:01.560
person in my position that stood up and said, Wasek, I like you. But isn't the deeper agenda,

01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:08.200
the human agenda, just being in love? What you're talking about, red hat is just politics, right?

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:11.560
I mean, the world is becoming more and more transactional every day. And actually,

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:17.560
marriages are actually originally based on transactions. And that's why they're less

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:22.840
needed, the more autonomous as we come, or the world makes it less needed. I feel like we do

01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:29.160
need each other. I feel like we do need someone we can always count on. It's like I'm, yay,

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:34.920
pulled away by King Koopa, which is the media, the politics, the promise, oh, we're going to

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:42.840
keep you safe. So the reason why I get really frustrated with Kris Jenner is she says losing

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:48.840
Rob Kardashian was the greatest mistake of her life, but she never gave Kim's hand over in

01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:55.320
marriage because this is the bottom line. When me and Kim met, we were millionaires or whatever,

01:51:55.320 --> 01:52:01.320
right? You're telling me you just hand her hand over in marriage that your daughter's not

01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:07.320
successful, handing your hand over in marriage too. But no, she had to still be the husband

01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:15.480
to all of her daughters. And we see what the results are consistently. So that's where I get

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:22.840
frustrated. It's like, let that go. Let this person do what you made mistakes on. Don't make

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:26.920
this person relive those same mistakes and then put that agenda into my daughters too.

01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:34.600
Is there somebody in your life close to you that you trust enough to call you out on your

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:42.520
bullshit? We're all full of shit sometimes. What's my bullshit? Well, some of it I pointed out today,

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:47.000
but I don't know you deeply enough. What was the bullshit? Jewish media, Jewish. That's not

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.240
bullshit. The bullshit is that the Jewish media won't admit. Your dad was right. Your dad was

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:58.840
right. The words you used. You weren't- And I said it. You're not going to make me say it

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:05.480
800 more times. I don't know if it resonated because you keep saying the words- Did it resonate to

01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:09.800
y'all that y'all ain't do nothing about it and that all y'all want to do is have somebody

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:16.040
apologize and sweep under the rug your bullshit that you've been doing the whole time. You own

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:22.440
the same bullshit as the other people. So you're doing the same thing that the other, let's say

01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:28.600
media because I'm not allowed to say, has done. So until somebody- Which is what, man? Which is

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.360
what? I'm trying to call you out on your bullshit because I hope I'm somebody you can trust.

01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:40.680
I don't fucking trust you. Well, you should find people in your life you can trust. Don't tell me

01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:47.880
what I should do. I'm not one of your BLM marchers. Listen, I'm with you on the BLM. A lot of

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:56.520
organizations use tragedy and I watched the Candace Owens documentary. And what was your take on it?

01:53:57.480 --> 01:54:03.240
I think it's important to question the mainstream narratives but I don't agree with it. I still

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:12.520
believe that George Floyd died from the knee of the cop, not from fentanyl. And even if that was

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:17.080
the case, there's still 50% of black deaths is actually abortion.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:25.880
So let's get into engineering. Let's just go- How do you fix that? Population control is social

01:54:25.880 --> 01:54:34.920
engineering in its most literal form. The blacks that are under population control,

01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:40.920
that's something that, I mean, that's just what it is. African Americans are not choosing to get

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.840
the abortion. I mean, it's a choice. It's an individual choice. But we're being influenced to.

01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:50.280
Well, then speak to the community and help. I mean, I don't know what the engineering solutions

01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:57.160
there are. It could be you're doing that in part by speaking to the value and the power of family.

01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:07.800
Well, watch this. I was building shelters. I bought land in Calabasas. I bought two ranches

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:15.400
in Wyoming, 300 acres in Calabasas, 12,000 acres in total in Wyoming. And I started building ideas

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:23.960
for shelters. And God set it on my heart to make monasteries, which would be modern day facilities

01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:33.320
that don't turn people down, that have farms, that have shelter, clothing. But first of all,

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:40.520
water. First of all, knowledge. Because knowledge is the most important resource to our species

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:47.240
above water. Knowledge itself. Because then you can go get water. I mean, you can argue like if

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:53.160
you're a baby, how do you get water? But the baby doesn't have it. So someone with the knowledge

01:55:53.240 --> 01:56:03.720
then feeds the baby the water. But it's important that those with the knowledge teach the baby

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:10.120
how to find the water themselves. And the business people that I've been dealing with

01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:15.960
have been keeping the baby sick by not sharing the information and the knowledge

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.400
with inside of those contracts. My people are sick. If I load up

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:30.360
Apple Music right now and I play the top songs in the rap chart, I would tell you my people

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:37.320
are sick. If I go to the restaurants and Opportunity Zones and we look at the calorie

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:44.040
rating and the cholesterol, I will tell you that my people are sick. If we look at the obesity rate,

01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:50.280
if you go to just a restaurant somewhere in middle America, Denny's or something,

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:55.400
I went to Denny's the other day, you will see that my people are sick and my people meaning all

01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:04.280
people. But black people are very influential to all people. So if the media picks an overweight

01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:11.880
black woman and says this is body goals, then the media are influencing my people to stay sick.

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:20.120
And it just so happens that that night, I was so frustrated after 20 years

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:29.400
that I had to call it out in one tweet that now, even if I say, hey, okay, I was frustrated for

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:36.040
these reasons, now it's not good enough. You've literally tried to make me re-apologize 10 times

01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:42.760
in this meeting, re-say this, re-say that, but it doesn't change the fact that my people are sick

01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:49.160
and I'm the only person in my position that will say that my people are sick. Today, not 30 years

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:55.480
ago, not 60 years ago, my people are sick today. 50% of my peoples of deaths are abortion today.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:01.240
My people don't have the opportunities today, even to the point that because if JP Morgan

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.720
had been nice to me and if Alex Klein, a STEM player had been fair to me, different things,

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:09.160
then I wouldn't even point it out that we don't have any black, we have two black engineers.

01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:16.200
So I have to have a responsibility, obviously to all people, but specifically to my tribe,

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:25.080
because tribes move. Tribalism is real with black people. To separate the brightest from the tribe

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:31.080
or to separate the leaders, it is factual that the CIA remove the leaders from the black community,

01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:36.040
put crack in the communities, put guns in the communities and locked up all the leaders and

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:40.440
called them gang leaders, locked up all the leaders, locked up all the fathers. Now,

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:47.400
72% of black mothers are raising children by themselves. This is a gender like a Tuskegee

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:54.120
experiment set on my people. What I'm calling out for the black people in entertainment is,

01:58:54.120 --> 01:59:00.600
is what are we doing? We have to collude. And if we don't collude, because even if I said,

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:06.200
hey, I'd like to make a company that's all black, right? Is that okay for me to say?

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:12.120
Is that okay for me to say? Or is that anti-Semitic? See, if I hadn't crossed the

01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:18.440
line so far, then that would have sounded anti-Semitic. Now I've stretched a bit.

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:23.960
So now we can go to, okay, let's make an all black company, but that would have been anti-Semitic.

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:28.840
Just that concept, because you could word that in a different way that would sound anti-Semitic.

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:34.040
I don't know, man. I have to be- No, no, listen. If you were, if I said I didn't want to have the

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:39.560
Jewish people in the company, would that be anti-Semitic? It would sound like it, right?

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:45.160
You'd say I'm from 1930s, right? Yeah. But for me as a tribe to say, no, I want an all black company,

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:50.520
right? I'm generally against that kind of thing. But first of all, you have the right to do whatever

01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:53.480
the hell you want. This is America. Well, what I'm saying is that's what I feel

01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:59.800
may need to happen for my people to have power again, because when my people have been left

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:05.880
under the media's control, we've been made sick. We've been allowed to be sick and we're promoting

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:13.320
sickness. I think, at least in the engineering realm, I haven't met an engineer who happens to

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:18.200
be black who would like to be called a black engineer. And when you have a company of all

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:23.400
black people that are engineers, I don't know the creative arts, I apologize, but engineering,

02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:31.640
they really try to look at each other as humans and look at the problem. And you want to know,

02:00:31.640 --> 02:00:36.840
you want to have the confidence that everybody on the team is the best possible person for the job.

02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:48.600
What I can say is the world is sick and I have slight images of utopia,

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:55.480
slight images of happiness, slight images as a visionary and a creator. And I know for

02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:02.280
fact, the way that business deals have been done for me are keeping the world sick.

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:10.600
Fix them. I see that's what you're trying to do. And you probably, listen, people should not doubt,

02:01:10.600 --> 02:01:18.600
yay. But I got to tell you, I have to be honest. This is silly because you don't know me, but it

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.560
hurt when you say you don't trust me. You kind of lost me. I don't think anyone's ever said that to

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:34.760
me. I don't know, man. Fuck that. I don't care about views or clickbait or any of that bullshit.

02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:41.240
I just thought you were one of the greatest artists ever. It'd be cool to talk to you.

02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:46.120
And I just, I feel like you got pain you're working through. I never had anyone say that to me.

02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:51.400
Maybe I'm just being a mess about it, I guess. That's fucked up though. But maybe it's not.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:54.280
Maybe you shouldn't trust it. But I just haven't had that experience.

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:58.760
Yeah. Do you think I would trust anybody at this point in my life?

02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:05.720
Yeah, it's tough. It's tough. It's tough. I hear you. And it's also kind of good to see how much

02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:12.200
strength you got. You're not broken by any of this. You're under a lot of attack. A lot of attack

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.360
by a lot of people. You have a vision and you're trying to feel your way through it.

02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.640
And you might get destroyed for it. That's the risk you take.

02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:29.000
It's a wonderful life though. What do you hope your legacy is?

02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:32.840
To be forgotten. Do you think you'll be forgotten?

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:40.600
Because the memory, there's ego in memory and the memories. Who designed the sidewalk?

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:45.080
Who designed the water fountain? Who designed the stop sign? Who designed the

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:51.880
stop light? These things are so ubiquitous that the person that designed them is forgotten.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:03:00.920
If it's a good idea, it's a God idea. And no VCs can own it.

02:03:03.160 --> 02:03:09.400
So you want your designs in all realms of life to be so simple that they

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:17.720
permeate everything. They take over and you're forgotten. That's a successful design. You're

02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:24.680
forgotten. Yes. Do you have advice for people? A lot of young people look up to you. Do you

02:03:24.680 --> 02:03:33.480
have advice for young people of how to live a life they can be proud of? Don't tweet while you're

02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:41.400
sleepy. Take a nap? Surely there's other things. I love the humor. Don't take it seriously,

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:51.160
I suppose is what that means. Don't send sleepy tweets. Unless you buy your own social platform

02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:56.360
the very next week called Parlor. But other than that, if you're not going to buy your own social

02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:01.800
platform, then don't. Is that why you bought parlors so you could be sleepy and send messages

02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.720
out into the wild? I actually am really interested in the engineering aspects of

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:10.600
Parlor. Is there a vision there? Because I'm also super interested in Elon buying Twitter.

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:20.840
I like Instagram better than Twitter. And I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg liked Instagram better than

02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:28.120
Facebook or saw how valuable that was and he bought it. So you'd like to take Parlor as

02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:31.800
something, whatever is the magic that makes Instagram work you want to push?

02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:37.400
I thought it was interesting how it felt like Snapchat made the Kardashians bully Instagram.

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:42.600
What's the point of Snapchat going to war on Instagram?

02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:49.000
Everyone wants to say, well, this is our value Snapchat. No one wants to lose their value to

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:55.720
someone else's value. And everything is just, what's the difference between permanent and

02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:04.040
temporary? Is this a permanent structure? Until God says it's not. Nothing's permanent. Our life

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:10.040
is not permanent. So how do we just let go of those things? Even going from the name Kanye West

02:05:10.040 --> 02:05:17.960
to Ye was the beginning of just letting go of some things, of these titles. We need to remove

02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:27.240
the titles like, hey, if I have to leave Adidas and I have to go next computers, that may take

02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:34.760
me out of the billionaire standing altogether. And I got to get low for however long God says I have

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:43.240
to get low and refocus. I've been reshaping, refocusing my staff. I had some people that

02:05:43.240 --> 02:05:47.960
were good and I had some people that weren't. I had too many people and I've got a vision inside

02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:52.920
of me and I'm like, this is how I make this vision. I have to bring this vision to life.

02:05:54.120 --> 02:06:01.160
I have to bring these houses to life. I was talking to one of our architects on,

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:08.280
we're actually getting close on it. I've built it a few times. I had the domes you probably saw

02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:16.120
and I said how he transformed Kim's house and now we're getting there.

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.560
So you won't get into architecture. You really want this to become physical reality.

02:06:21.560 --> 02:06:25.160
Yes, and I've got close. Rome wasn't built to today.

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:29.400
Yeah, but Rome had to start somewhere. I got to call you out on the advice.

02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:33.320
There really is a lot of people that look up to you and you've lived a really difficult life

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:40.200
and you made it through all of it. What do you advise them to do?

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:46.920
Do everything that you feel, even if you are told that it's the wrong thing.

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.120
No, no, no, no, no, but not anything violent.

02:06:50.840 --> 02:06:54.440
So do what you feel, say what you feel, like trust your heart.

02:06:54.440 --> 02:07:01.080
Yeah, trust your gut, trust your instincts because that instinct is who God made you to be.

02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:09.080
Not what lines up with your frat brothers or what lines up with what your dad wanted

02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:15.960
or what lines up with your classmates. It's just God has something inside of you

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:19.720
and when you walk down the street, you're thinking about it and then you just see it in the window

02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:23.720
and you go down another street and you see the same thing or you're thinking about a number

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.480
and that number pops up or you see it on a license plate and that's just

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:38.440
you know, something is trying to say be the maximum, yay, you know, be the maximum you

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:47.480
and God won't give you anything that you can't handle. So for me, everything is a yes.

02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:51.000
I think they say be like water. I know Bruce Lee said that.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:08:00.600
Or matter of fact, just be because we are beings with engineering opportunities.

02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:09.240
Beautifully put. Yay. I have hope, I have faith that however this turns out that

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:14.760
you have the skill and the capacity to really add love to the world and I hope you do that.

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:20.280
I really, really hope you do that and we talked about the tension of that,

02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:27.160
the challenges and the opportunities of that. I mean, I see how we could be of use to each other.

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:34.200
You actually have a particular thing for me as I eject from media because even also, you know,

02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:39.400
I'm really big at like, you know, burning the Phoenix too. All you know is the engineer that

02:08:39.720 --> 02:08:44.840
your cells completely regenerate every seven years. I think I rushed the process a little

02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:49.960
bit so I run around looking like a burn victim sometimes. Yeah. But I got to tell you, anyone I

02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:54.520
am close with, I work with, there has to be trust, there has to be love

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.640
and I think you've been burned quite a bit in your life.

02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:02.440
Sometimes I did it myself. I put my hand on the stove.

02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:09.720
So how do we get to engineering? There's a deal to be done here. Not saying you're making this

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:13.160
money off of that, I'm making that money off, but there's- I don't care about money by the way.

02:09:13.160 --> 02:09:20.840
Same, twins. So there's dealings here. You got pain, I got pain, but we're beings with

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:25.160
engineering opportunities. For a long time, I thought somebody should create a new social

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:32.120
network and it looks like great engineering could do that. You got two at one time from two of your

02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:37.240
homeboys at one time. Yeah. And that's a great way to- I mean, every- it can be done from scratch

02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:43.160
or it can be done anew with an already established platform. Yeah. I'm very excited by that

02:09:43.160 --> 02:09:50.040
possibility. Parler is smaller, Twitter is larger. I wonder whether you can do any kind of

02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:55.960
revolutionary engineering with a large company. If anyone can, I would say it's Elon. Well, Elon

02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:01.720
can look at what we do over here. That's why I like- God does this a lot of times.

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:10.760
He creates doppelgangers. There's a lot of examples where theory happen two places at one time,

02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:16.280
a really similar type of personality happens at one time. It's weird. It's beautiful. It's

02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:22.680
hilarious actually. Yeah. It's kind of humorous. So we should just share

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:30.840
every piece of information together. As I go build Parler and as he builds up Twitter and see how to

02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:36.360
make both those better, but I'll be like, hey, I'm not going to let Snapchat bully me out of

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:44.920
adding something to it that's best. It should just be the best platform possible. That means

02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:53.560
that TikTok has amazing features. Twitter has amazing things about it. I know this girl that's

02:10:53.560 --> 02:11:00.520
like, I like Instagram better than Twitter. She likes that Twitter has porn, but other than that,

02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:06.360
Instagram. But I was like, well, Instagram is porn also. It's soft. It's more subtle. It's not

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:14.760
telling you. It's not conservative by any means. That's the thing. You have to please

02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:22.200
a lot of people with these platforms. And I think the goal of a platform should be to help

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:32.200
individuals maximize their long-term happiness and growth, like intellectually, spiritually,

02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:36.760
psychologically, all of that. And it's a tricky thing to figure out how to do that. Of course,

02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.680
you could just have a platform that's just strictly for fun. I think that's where TikTok leans,

02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:48.520
but I think there's a balance to strike. There's a lot of intellectual philosophical stuff going

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:53.160
on on Twitter, but it somehow currently makes it too easy to be divisive and hateful towards

02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:57.480
each other and cancel and all that kind of stuff. I think we need to have these healthy

02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:02.760
conversations. That's what it is, healthy conversations, healthy dialogues. That's the

02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:09.960
biggest thing. When I first wore the red hat, the conversation is less healthy than it is today.

02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:17.960
The conversation about George Floyd, it's like, did I send the tweet the right way?

02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:25.720
Did? Is Candace Owen's documentary perfect? Is Michael Moore's documentary perfect? Is

02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:33.800
Century Self, is it fully accurate? It's two to three hours of a transmit of information through

02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:42.280
particularly, usually one person's view. Anything you want to research if you're interested in it,

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:50.520
you got to look at 10 versions of it, 20 versions of it. George Floyd, we've looked at one version

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:58.600
of that. Now we have a second. By the time we get to the... I know this is like,

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:05.720
it's not my last hoodie, but it's definitely not my first hoodie that I put on. That's how we got

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:15.400
to it. Even this particular size of zipper or the fact that for people who know, they know that

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:22.280
it's Carhartt, even though the Carhartt tag isn't there anymore, you just know by the shape of it

02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:28.120
you feel it. It abstracts. It takes into this Cubist place like Picasso, Matisse or African

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:33.320
Cubism or Dire Straits. Money for nothing and your chicks for free. Look at that.

02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:37.560
I wouldn't think you could reference Dire Straits. Look at you.

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:38.520
That video.

02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:43.240
Yeah, I know. It's a great video. Your encyclopedic knowledge of music is great.

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:51.720
I think that porn is not just sexual. That term actually relates to torture. You know what I'm

02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:58.200
saying? Watching people beat each other up on Worldstar or something. That's called torture

02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:02.600
porn. There's also food porn. How do you explain that? What's food porn?

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:07.560
Food porn is looking at really delicious cakes and cookies and steak and so on and you're like,

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:12.920
holy shit. Exactly. Architecture. There's people who love architecture. When they see architecture,

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.080
I know... I got friends who'll be like, oh, that's porn. Architecture.

02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:27.000
Yeah. That's like love, like dopamine-fueled love for a thing. That's beautiful. I think

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:30.200
that's beautiful. As long as nobody's getting hurt.

02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:38.520
The intoxication that people have. The worst part is when one person's in love and the other

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:39.320
person's in like...

02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.800
That's us right now.

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:44.120
Well, who's in like?

02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:46.840
No, because you said you love Bill Maher and you like me.

02:14:49.720 --> 02:14:51.480
And I love you, so that was...

02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.000
No, I actually love you both.

02:14:54.520 --> 02:15:07.480
And the funny thing is as a visionary, visionaries are more extreme than business people

02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:15.720
because a visionary would do bad business for their vision. A business person will never do

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:20.600
bad business. It's well put. Yeah, it's really well put. So when you say, I don't care about

02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:25.960
money, it's like, yeah, I feel you. I feel that I care in a way that I need that, but

02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:38.600
I care about the vision that I have to a Steve Jobs level, to the point of putting that above

02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:47.880
my regular human existence, meaning having to go and take all the arrows that I become

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:53.800
having to go and take all the arrows that I become a soldier of the vision.

02:15:54.440 --> 02:16:00.440
Because someone could say, a wife could say to like, say like in the 60s,

02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:08.280
their husband's about to go to war. The wife may not want their husband to go to war

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:14.920
because of their children, but he's going to war

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:17.000
because of their children.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.840
Definitely. Do you regret any aspect of just giving everything to your vision?

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:26.840
I mean, you've spoken about that saying like, I got fucked over in the business side.

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:32.440
I promise that I had to stop envying

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:41.080
cool people at their current cool time.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.000
At their current cool time.

02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:51.640
If anything, if someone's cool, and I say their name a lot, I'm going to flash

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:59.080
the light on them so much that it ages their coolness. It's actually a war technique.

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:02.040
Showered in compliments.

02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:03.100
Yeah.

02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:13.400
To be able to stay at 45 years old to still be the bad kid in class, at 45, I'm still in the

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:20.040
principal's office. Because if you look at like, say fashion, if you think of something fashionable,

02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:25.320
it's probably going to look like the kid in the principal's office. That's going to be the

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:32.280
fashion. That's part of the reason why I'm the most influential person in fashion, because I

02:17:32.280 --> 02:17:38.760
refuse to leave the principal's office. If the substitute teacher comes in, I'm going to say,

02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.040
you got a big butt.

02:17:43.720 --> 02:17:45.480
Right back to the principal's office.

02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:50.760
People are going to be like, yo. That's what you keep on saying. Who can we talk to?

02:17:51.640 --> 02:18:00.120
Because no one can talk to me. I'm out of control, bro. It's just God, then me, and then

02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:06.600
fuck everybody. That's really how I live my life. I just want to say this one thing about

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.840
the children thing. I wanted to put that point together, put that idea together. I don't like

02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.800
the word point. I'm really big on words, words being powerful, says the person with the sleepy

02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.000
tweet. You're full of contradictions.

02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:26.200
Yeah, I'm a human being. Some days I'm like, I could go 30 days and be celibate. Really,

02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:33.880
I'm a monk. I'm being faithful to God, and then I'll go working out. No carbs. My weight will

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:39.080
fluctuate. I'll have times I'm like, I don't feel like being told what to do, so I don't want to

02:18:39.080 --> 02:18:43.960
work out with a trainer, and I just want to drink this Hennessy. But I want to say this thing that

02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:54.120
I will text to Kim sometimes. I'll say, you may not understand what I'm doing right now,

02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:00.840
but you will. And that's what I would say to everyone. You may not understand what I'm doing.

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:05.720
And this gives a little bit, maybe we're like 20% there, but there's still going to be people,

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:09.640
we leave this interview, and they'll be like, I still don't like the way they apologize. I

02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:15.800
still don't want to say what my involvement would have been to lead them to that point.

02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.960
And we just want things to be how they are. There's people in the world who want the world

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:25.480
to stay as it is, and there's people who want to change the world. And that's happened throughout

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:31.480
time. They say that with DaVinci, halfway into a conversation, he could not suffer fools so much

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:38.440
that he would walk away halfway into the conversation. And I said, well, that's why

02:19:39.720 --> 02:19:47.480
it's the DaVinci Code and not the DaVinci world. And every time I go and piss off a group of people

02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:53.640
or do these things, on some end, it's like, I could be turning my thing from a potential

02:19:53.640 --> 02:20:00.440
world vision to a code, or I could be opening up conversations with new friends that I may trust

02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:07.400
someday. Yeah, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. Because the change you will have on the world that

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:14.280
you don't know for sure, but it will happen across years, even decades. So you have to think in the

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:19.320
future. You're working in the future. Your actions are working in the future. And a lot of people

02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:23.720
will judge this conversation and others you've done and so on in the present, and that doesn't

02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:27.960
matter. You know why I apologize, why I say I'm sorry to the Jewish people that I hurt?

02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:36.680
It's not about, like I said, I'm not going to hold this apology hostage, right? Obviously,

02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:41.480
it's about God, but God is everything, right? So what's the point of having language? You can't

02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:48.680
engineer if you say, God, God, God, right? It's like, God asks us to be judgmental so that you

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:54.040
become, if you're a doctor, right? It's your judgment that saves grandma, right? And God puts

02:20:54.040 --> 02:20:59.800
that in this. We have God inside us. We're a piece of God also, right? So I'm going to

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:08.760
go specific to a person. That story about DaVinci alone is enough of a reason for me to give a

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:16.280
sincere apology to the Jewish people. Because I do believe that there's a DaVinci code inside of all

02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:24.440
of my misspellings and scribbles right here that God wants me to get to the world. And

02:21:25.640 --> 02:21:31.720
when I'm in my way, if God has set something on me, when I'm in my way, I'm in God's way.

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:35.800
Now, I can point at other people and say, hey, you guys are in God's way because you're not

02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:42.760
listening to me. But if I'm in my way, I'm not listening to God. And for me to be a philosopher

02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:49.080
and a leader or whatever other language, I have to listen to God. So before God, what I would do

02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:56.920
is start off as a samurai and say, I'm sorry for hurting you as a Jewish person. I'm sorry for the

02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:04.360
way that made you feel. And I'm sorry for the entire population of a race that I feel is actually

02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:10.360
my brothers because I classify and feel that I'm also connected with Christ in that way,

02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:15.880
that my people came from Africa in that way. And I can't say it's this exact teaching or

02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:21.320
that exact teaching, but I feel that there's an important, the sons of Abraham, however we want

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:27.640
to word it, for us to come together and bring our different talents together to serve God

02:22:27.640 --> 02:22:36.440
collectively. And he, as much of an alien as I am, he did not call for me to alienate.

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:43.080
And that's what the problem has been, especially in politics and in America. He plays America

02:22:43.080 --> 02:22:49.080
as the TV, as the radio to the world. We invented rock and roll. We are the influencers of the rest

02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:55.960
of the planet. We're the youngest startup in history. We're the youngest country. We're the

02:22:55.960 --> 02:23:02.760
youngest superpower. So for me in my position, the fact that I can talk to Trump one day and be at a

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:09.400
game with Kim Kardashian the next day and then be at Paris Fashion Week, they don't want me to be

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:18.120
involved with language of decisive, divisive language, proving that I can be just as racist

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:25.400
as a racist white person. Oh, I can be a racist black person also. That's not what God has called

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:34.520
me to do. So how do I simplify and say, hey, to you as a visionary, as an engineer, as a person

02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:40.360
that's given me a platform, that as my brother, I want to apologize to you for how that made you

02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:47.000
feel and to the rest of the people that carry specifically that pain, not the pain that I

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:52.600
talk about that doesn't seem to be as much of a pain for people when I talk about the abortion

02:23:52.600 --> 02:23:58.440
clinics and stuff. That's the argued pain even in my own community. Not everyone thinks that's a

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:08.840
pain, but for the Jewish community, it's collectively this was a pain and I've gone so far just

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:15.800
psychologically on this journey since that statement had happened where I didn't want to give up the

02:24:15.800 --> 02:24:21.320
candy in my pocket. I didn't want to say, hey, I stuck my hand in a candy jar. I wanted to defend

02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:25.880
my freedom of speech. I wanted this, but even with freedom of speech, pain is pain.

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:32.440
Causing people to hurt is not helping. Causing people to hurt is not helping. So that means

02:24:32.440 --> 02:24:41.080
I have to take a more sophisticated approach to engineering this problem. This problem is the

02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:49.080
opportunity. And yes, that what could some people may deem as a mistake. Would it be more genuine

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:57.240
if I called it a mistake? I think I would be hypocritical by calling it a mistake with the

02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:02.200
ending of the idea I'm going to say out loud. I don't try to be a hypocrite on purpose,

02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:13.160
but I will call it a mistake to be genuine about the feeling. With that mistake,

02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:22.600
with me as a human being, not to justify, but I have to state that God makes no mistakes because

02:25:22.600 --> 02:25:28.120
if I hadn't made that mistake, I wouldn't be in front of you today. And that's not to justify

02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:36.680
this sleepy text. But I can tell you're a man that has love in his heart. And I hear that,

02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:42.120
I hear it through the words explicitly and implicitly. And I think if we were to engineer

02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:48.680
a better future, the way to do that is with love. So as one human to another, I love you, brother.

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:55.000
Thank you for talking today. This is great. I like you too. Son of a bitch.

02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:20.520
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
