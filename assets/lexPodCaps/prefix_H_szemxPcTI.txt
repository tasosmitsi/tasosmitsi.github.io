00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
There are no right answers for anything involved in art.

00:03.080 --> 00:06.480
We're all trying experiments to find a way.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.300
And even for the things that I work on,

00:08.300 --> 00:11.160
I don't have a set way that I do anything.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.920
I come to every project blank.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.200
Maybe you're just a meat vehicle

00:16.200 --> 00:18.520
and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.

00:18.520 --> 00:23.520
I believe we know close to nothing, close to nothing,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.480
about anything.

00:25.480 --> 00:27.760
If we embrace that not knowing,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.860
we'll have a healthier experience going through life.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.880
The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,

00:36.880 --> 00:40.360
one of the greatest music producers of all time,

00:40.360 --> 00:43.680
known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,

00:43.680 --> 00:47.120
no matter the genre of music or even the medium of art,

00:47.120 --> 00:48.760
or just the medium of creating

00:48.760 --> 00:50.960
something beautiful in this world.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.160
And the list of musicians he produced includes many,

00:54.560 --> 00:57.760
many of the greats over the past 40 years,

00:57.760 --> 01:02.680
including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica, LL Cool J,

01:02.680 --> 01:06.520
Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty, Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks,

01:06.520 --> 01:10.360
Aerosmith, Adele, Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers,

01:10.360 --> 01:13.660
System of a Down, Jay-Z, Black Sabbath.

01:13.660 --> 01:16.520
I can keep going for a very long time here.

01:16.520 --> 01:20.600
Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.840
We became fast friends, which is surreal to say,

01:24.520 --> 01:26.680
and is just an incredible honor.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.600
I felt truly heard as a person

01:28.600 --> 01:30.240
when I spent the day with him

01:30.240 --> 01:32.440
eating some delicious Texas barbecue,

01:32.440 --> 01:37.440
talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.240
This was a conversation and experience I'll never forget.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.360
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.560
To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:46.560 --> 01:47.800
in the description.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.280
And now, dear friends, here's Rick Rubin.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.720
Are you nervous?

01:53.720 --> 01:57.240
I'm not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.600
And I feel like the sooner we start talking,

01:59.600 --> 02:01.320
the more relaxed we'll get.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.200
Yeah.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.920
Well, maybe we should sit in this moment

02:03.920 --> 02:05.840
and enjoy the nervousness of it.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.740
Let me start with Nietzsche.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.920
He said, without music, life would be a mistake.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.680
What do you think he means by that?

02:14.680 --> 02:15.960
Let's talk some philosophy.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.360
Let's try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche from a century ago.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.040
It seems like music has the ability

02:26.040 --> 02:31.040
to bring us so much depth in our soul

02:31.760 --> 02:33.780
that's hard to access any other way.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.220
And without it, there would be a loss

02:37.220 --> 02:39.560
beyond the pleasure of it.

02:41.560 --> 02:45.200
Feels like it's a window into something else.

02:45.200 --> 02:47.880
Something that no other medium

02:47.880 --> 02:51.020
can express quite the same way.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.100
I would say not as automatically.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.420
Something about music can do it automatically.

02:56.420 --> 03:01.420
Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms

03:02.340 --> 03:04.660
can get us there.

03:04.660 --> 03:06.860
But there's something about music

03:06.860 --> 03:09.380
that really can get us there quickly.

03:09.380 --> 03:11.980
But it's also the time, the place, the history.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.960
There's something about,

03:13.960 --> 03:16.400
like a lot of my family's still in Philly,

03:16.400 --> 03:20.580
there's something about driving through Jersey

03:20.580 --> 03:22.880
and listening to Bruce Springsteen.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.860
And then you just, I'll get emotional.

03:27.180 --> 03:29.460
Like listening to I'm On Fire.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.860
One of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,

03:33.860 --> 03:38.700
there's a haunting kind of strumming to it.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.740
It's not a strumming, it's actually picked.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.140
Has a country feel to it,

03:43.140 --> 03:45.180
almost like a Johnny Cash feel actually.

03:45.180 --> 03:47.620
And it, I don't know, makes me feel,

03:47.620 --> 03:50.060
so for people who don't know I'm On Fire,

03:50.060 --> 03:55.060
that song is I guess a love song to a woman

03:56.900 --> 04:01.900
that you can't have because she's married

04:02.220 --> 04:03.780
or she's with somebody else,

04:03.780 --> 04:06.360
which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.

04:06.360 --> 04:10.140
But there's something about the haunting nature of the guitar

04:10.140 --> 04:12.940
and then it has to be driving through Jersey.

04:12.940 --> 04:16.020
And I feel like everyone has fallen in love

04:16.020 --> 04:18.940
with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.060
I don't know if that's true for everybody.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.400
But I feel like that, I haven't either,

04:23.400 --> 04:25.660
but I just feel like that.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.900
There's something about Bruce Springsteen

04:26.900 --> 04:28.500
is like, yeah, I've been there.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.740
And that just takes you to a place of emotion

04:33.740 --> 04:37.340
that you just, that captures love,

04:37.340 --> 04:40.940
that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak

04:40.940 --> 04:42.460
of just the way time flows in life

04:42.460 --> 04:43.580
and the fact that it's finite.

04:43.580 --> 04:47.540
And just all of that in a single simple song.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.300
What else can capture that?

04:49.300 --> 04:50.780
Yeah, I don't know.

04:50.780 --> 04:53.960
But it's true that there's a connection

04:53.960 --> 04:55.780
both between time and place and music.

04:55.780 --> 05:00.780
And certain music growing up on the East Coast

05:02.040 --> 05:03.340
didn't really resonate with me

05:03.340 --> 05:05.260
until I spent time on the West Coast.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.700
Eagles being an example.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.220
When I lived in New York,

05:08.220 --> 05:09.900
the Eagles didn't really speak to me.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.440
ZZ Top didn't really speak to me.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.700
And then when I started spending time in California

05:14.700 --> 05:16.860
and driving through Laurel Canyon,

05:16.900 --> 05:18.420
all of a sudden the music of the Eagles

05:18.420 --> 05:21.940
felt appropriate somehow.

05:21.940 --> 05:23.900
And I started listening to it more.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.740
Got it.

05:24.740 --> 05:26.100
So not until you went out West,

05:26.100 --> 05:29.580
can you understand the sounds of the West?

05:29.580 --> 05:32.660
So it's really like New York has a sound.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.980
What other places have a sound in the United States?

05:34.980 --> 05:36.780
I think every place does.

05:36.780 --> 05:40.420
And that said, sometimes we can get an experience

05:40.420 --> 05:42.860
through music of a place,

05:42.860 --> 05:44.280
like we can resonate with the music

05:44.280 --> 05:45.560
and not understand why.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.840
And then maybe when we go to the place where it was created,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.060
it's almost like we have a knowingness of that place.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.040
It's not a strange place anymore.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan with blues and Texas blues.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.680
You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,

06:01.680 --> 06:04.720
again, this is like a woman you're missing, a broken heart,

06:04.720 --> 06:08.320
and somehow that connects you to the place, the Eagles.

06:09.240 --> 06:11.440
What song with the Eagles connects with you?

06:11.440 --> 06:15.560
We're talking about like Take It Easy,

06:15.560 --> 06:18.480
or are we talking more like Hotel California?

06:18.480 --> 06:22.120
I'm thinking Take It Easy, but both are great.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.800
Yeah, there's certain songs

06:23.800 --> 06:27.040
when I started learning guitar when I was young,

06:27.040 --> 06:29.520
that's like, I wouldn't like to be the kind of person

06:29.520 --> 06:31.960
that not only knows how to play this song,

06:31.960 --> 06:34.020
but understands the song,

06:34.020 --> 06:39.020
and like have that song be something I played 20 years ago.

06:39.780 --> 06:42.660
And I've lived with that song for a while.

06:42.660 --> 06:45.500
Like Hotel California is an example.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.480
Obviously there's the solo,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.380
but there's also the soulfulness of the lyrics,

06:50.380 --> 06:51.780
which I still don't understand.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.900
And it could be about anything.

06:52.900 --> 06:53.820
And as you get older,

06:53.820 --> 06:56.100
I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.740
Yeah, I think that's true.

06:57.740 --> 06:59.020
I think that's the beauty of them.

06:59.020 --> 07:00.300
I think when the person wrote them,

07:00.300 --> 07:03.240
they may have had one interpretation,

07:04.780 --> 07:08.420
but it's not contingent on us getting that interpretation

07:08.420 --> 07:12.820
to like it or resonate with it or feel it.

07:12.820 --> 07:17.700
In some ways, the best art is open enough

07:18.780 --> 07:21.660
where the artist gets to have their experience

07:21.660 --> 07:22.500
when they make it,

07:22.500 --> 07:24.480
and then the audience gets to have their experience

07:24.480 --> 07:26.900
when they listen and they don't have to be the same.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.380
And then it connects thousands

07:28.380 --> 07:31.340
or millions of people together.

07:31.340 --> 07:34.180
There's a togetherness of music when you share that music,

07:34.180 --> 07:36.820
when you're listening to stuff together, like in a car.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.740
First of all, the car is a sacred place.

07:39.740 --> 07:42.140
So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.580
And you start to think, well,

07:44.580 --> 07:46.780
what are the things you lose

07:46.780 --> 07:51.160
when the car stops being the central part of American life?

07:53.060 --> 07:54.900
The car ownership.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.780
It just feels like the car, when you're alone,

07:57.780 --> 08:01.100
it's like a therapist thing, session,

08:01.100 --> 08:04.220
because you get angry at other humans.

08:04.980 --> 08:09.540
And then you get to sit in your own anger and emotion.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.260
You get to listen to the song on a long road trip

08:12.260 --> 08:16.940
and remember, like run through your memories,

08:16.940 --> 08:20.300
the heartbreak, I don't know, the one that got away,

08:20.300 --> 08:23.440
but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.140
Yeah.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.980
And all of that in the car.

08:27.980 --> 08:30.780
Yeah, driving also serves another purpose.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.220
And it's one of the things that we can do

08:34.220 --> 08:39.220
that we have to pay attention enough not to crash,

08:41.180 --> 08:45.660
but typically can essentially run on autopilot enough

08:45.660 --> 08:47.580
where we could be thinking about something else

08:47.580 --> 08:50.580
or concentrating on something else.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.500
And the difference between concentrating on something

08:53.500 --> 08:55.540
or trying to solve a problem

08:55.540 --> 08:57.580
when you're solely trying to solve a problem

08:57.580 --> 08:59.620
versus when you have some little task

08:59.620 --> 09:01.940
that's keeping you occupied,

09:01.940 --> 09:06.940
I find if I have something slight to take care of,

09:09.060 --> 09:13.020
it frees a more creative side of my mind

09:13.020 --> 09:15.540
to better solve problems.

09:15.540 --> 09:17.260
You know, I'm kind of jealous of people

09:17.260 --> 09:19.740
that found that in painting, for example.

09:19.740 --> 09:22.740
They'll be drawing or painting and listening to,

09:22.740 --> 09:25.100
so that's the small task you do.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.440
You're coloring in the lines.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.640
It's like this gentle, peaceful, slow process

09:31.640 --> 09:33.800
that requires just a small fraction of your mind

09:33.800 --> 09:34.820
and then you can listen.

09:34.820 --> 09:37.000
Some people listen to podcasts that way.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.160
Some people listen to music that way.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.040
Yeah.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.000
How do you do it?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.960
How do you free your mind?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.080
Running is one of them.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.060
There's a process.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.120
So most freeing of the mind for me

09:57.120 --> 10:01.400
has to go through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.020
So doing something difficult,

10:04.040 --> 10:06.960
it's just like an airplane taking off or something.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.100
So that's, for example, running,

10:09.100 --> 10:12.280
the first few miles would just be just,

10:12.280 --> 10:14.720
first of all, the physical aspect,

10:14.720 --> 10:17.200
which is like, ah, you're so fat, you're out of shape,

10:17.200 --> 10:20.120
you're, this is getting old, this, that.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.920
Okay, that slowly dissipates.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.640
And then the demons come in who are like,

10:25.640 --> 10:30.080
you should be getting this and that and this done.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.440
You haven't gotten it done.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.600
You're like breaking promises,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.040
all those kinds of voices coming in.

10:36.040 --> 10:41.040
And after that, maybe mile four, it's like, fuck it.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.000
You just run, run with the wind at a very slow pace,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.960
but with the wind and then you could think.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.960
So it's the footsteps, the physical activity,

10:50.960 --> 10:52.960
then you can deeply think about stuff.

10:52.960 --> 10:57.000
Ideas, sort of design, whether it's program design stuff

10:57.000 --> 10:59.360
or like high level life decisions,

10:59.360 --> 11:00.280
all those kinds of things.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.480
I would say running.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.600
I used to build bridges from toothpicks.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.800
I used to be a thing.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.520
It's an engineering, I guess some people like

11:10.520 --> 11:13.120
glued together airplanes and stuff like that.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.560
But the bridges, it's such deeply honest work

11:17.560 --> 11:19.020
because at the end of it,

11:19.020 --> 11:21.400
you're gonna have to test that bridge

11:21.440 --> 11:24.160
and you're gonna see how good your work was.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.720
The little details, but also the big picture.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.760
Do you use glue or no?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.800
Yeah, I use glue.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.800
So it's not pure physics, it's materials engineering too.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.800
Because the way you want to do it

11:39.800 --> 11:42.760
is you actually split the wood as thin as possible

11:42.760 --> 11:44.000
and then glue it back together

11:44.000 --> 11:46.920
because the glue is really strong

11:46.920 --> 11:49.080
except for the arches and things like that.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.760
So you're building arch bridges,

11:50.760 --> 11:52.320
which is a whole nother skill

11:52.320 --> 11:54.460
because you have to bend the wood.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.320
And it's so cool because the thing can hold

11:56.320 --> 11:58.880
thousands of times its weight.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.880
And then you get to watch it explode at a certain point

12:04.540 --> 12:05.600
from the pressure.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.440
And when you do a really good job,

12:07.440 --> 12:11.640
it doesn't explode in a kind of some weak point

12:11.640 --> 12:14.680
that you didn't anticipate just kind of starts cracking.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.280
Everything cracks, everything explodes.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.440
It's just pieces fly everywhere.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.520
It's literally hundreds of hours of work

12:23.520 --> 12:26.600
just explode in front of you.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.400
And that's a metaphor for life maybe.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.720
And it's all for nothing.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.960
Except for the journey that you took to get there

12:34.960 --> 12:37.600
and no one understands.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.640
Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.280
These questions are ridiculous.

12:42.280 --> 12:46.000
So you're gonna have to try to figure out

12:46.000 --> 12:48.380
what the heck I'm trying to do here.

12:48.460 --> 12:52.580
So Nietzsche also said a line I love,

12:52.580 --> 12:55.020
which is, and those who were seen dancing

12:55.020 --> 12:56.340
were thought to be insane

12:56.340 --> 12:58.300
by those who could not hear the music.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.460
Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?

13:02.460 --> 13:05.900
Or maybe you're the one who's sane

13:05.900 --> 13:07.300
and everybody else is crazy.

13:07.300 --> 13:11.940
You know that the dancing, the joy of the music

13:11.940 --> 13:14.780
of just feeling the music and everybody else

13:14.780 --> 13:15.860
just doesn't understand.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.720
And this doesn't have to be literally about music.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.440
This is about art, about creation.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.920
I would say I feel different.

13:26.880 --> 13:28.640
And it's hard to say.

13:28.640 --> 13:33.640
It's like which side of the equation is crazy, you know?

13:33.640 --> 13:37.840
Did you ever find a group of people that you get,

13:37.840 --> 13:39.180
they get you?

13:39.180 --> 13:40.020
Yes.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.120
Is that what producing is essentially?

13:42.120 --> 13:43.480
Is you try to find the moments

13:43.480 --> 13:45.560
when you just get each other?

13:45.560 --> 13:46.400
No.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.640
I would say they're definitely

13:55.920 --> 13:58.400
certain artists with certain temperaments.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.600
When you're around them,

13:59.600 --> 14:02.360
it feels like you can finish each other's sentences.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.880
You know, just see the world the same way.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.140
Comedians as well.

14:07.960 --> 14:12.960
And that's not essential for the two of you together

14:13.080 --> 14:14.720
creating something special.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.160
No, no.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.160
So it could be attention too?

14:18.160 --> 14:20.920
It could be any, there's no rules.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.200
It'd be like, think of it like a coach.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.200
A coach could bring what they have to bring

14:29.560 --> 14:34.560
to any talented individual and help them find their way.

14:36.940 --> 14:40.440
And sometimes the right coach for the right athlete

14:40.440 --> 14:44.120
really works and other times there's a mismatch.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.660
Have you seen the movie Whiplash?

14:46.660 --> 14:47.500
I did.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.340
I saw it when it came out

14:48.340 --> 14:49.960
so I don't really remember it well, but I did see it.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.380
So there's a coach type of figure

14:52.380 --> 14:56.120
who is pushing a drummer to create,

14:56.120 --> 14:58.280
to grow as a musician,

14:58.280 --> 15:00.160
but also to create something special.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.280
I don't know if it's even special music skill-wise,

15:02.280 --> 15:04.080
it's a special moment.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.060
I don't know what he's trying to create.

15:06.060 --> 15:08.160
From one perspective, it's just an abusive,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.280
a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive

15:11.280 --> 15:12.680
to those he's with.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.720
But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,

15:15.720 --> 15:20.400
it's just the two right humans finding each other

15:20.400 --> 15:21.800
at the right moment in life

15:21.800 --> 15:24.360
and risking destroying each other in the process,

15:24.360 --> 15:27.720
but maybe something beautiful will come of it.

15:29.180 --> 15:32.000
Do you think that's a toxic relationship?

15:32.960 --> 15:37.640
Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you

15:37.640 --> 15:40.680
as that sometimes is required to create art?

15:42.840 --> 15:43.680
That kind of suffering.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.920
Yeah, it doesn't.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.120
Well, there's suffering involved,

15:46.120 --> 15:47.680
but not that kind of suffering.

15:49.800 --> 15:50.640
Not for me.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.160
There are some people who that's their process

15:53.160 --> 15:55.320
and that's whatever works.

15:55.320 --> 15:59.000
There's no right answers for anything involved in art.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.400
We're all trying experiments to find a way.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.240
And even for the things that I work on,

16:04.240 --> 16:07.100
I don't have a set way that I do anything.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.400
I come to every project blank

16:10.400 --> 16:15.400
and see, I really listen to what the artist plays

16:17.680 --> 16:22.680
and says, and through what they explain they wanna do,

16:26.840 --> 16:29.360
help find the best way to get there.

16:30.560 --> 16:35.560
Was it implicit in the movie that the mean teacher

16:35.640 --> 16:38.800
liked being a mean teacher?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.400
You said the way you described it was

16:41.400 --> 16:43.320
that he got off on treating people this way.

16:43.320 --> 16:44.520
Do we know that to be the case?

16:44.520 --> 16:45.360
I don't remember that in the movie.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.880
No, but we sometimes project that onto people,

16:47.880 --> 16:52.160
people who are really rough on students.

16:52.160 --> 16:54.040
You start to think, well, maybe,

16:58.680 --> 17:01.000
maybe that is fundamentally who they are

17:01.000 --> 17:03.440
and if it's fundamentally who they are,

17:03.440 --> 17:05.160
that there must be some pleasure in it

17:05.160 --> 17:07.440
or it's an addiction of some sort.

17:07.520 --> 17:12.520
But it could be also a deliberate choice

17:12.680 --> 17:14.040
made by the teacher.

17:14.040 --> 17:18.040
It also could be a lineage like in the Zen tradition,

17:18.040 --> 17:23.040
they're sort of the mean Roshi's

17:23.200 --> 17:27.400
who if you do something wrong, take a physical action.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.760
And it's just in the lineage,

17:30.760 --> 17:34.240
it's considered that's how you teach.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.560
I didn't come from that lineage.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.760
So I'm much more of a,

17:39.760 --> 17:43.080
I feel like it's more of a collaboration

17:43.080 --> 17:46.560
between people working together to make the best thing.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.560
It's not a boss slave relationship at all.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.040
It's much more of a, let's find our way.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.720
And we agree at the beginning of the process

17:57.720 --> 18:02.160
that if either of us or any of us

18:02.160 --> 18:03.560
don't like what's happening,

18:03.600 --> 18:05.800
we say it and the goal is to keep working

18:05.800 --> 18:09.440
till we get to a point where we're all really happy with it.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.040
It's like if we make something

18:11.040 --> 18:13.080
that an artist likes and I don't like,

18:13.080 --> 18:14.840
or if that I like and they don't like,

18:14.840 --> 18:16.240
we haven't gone far enough.

18:17.600 --> 18:21.280
In terms of lineage, the ones that seek destruction

18:21.280 --> 18:22.560
and the ones that seek happiness

18:22.560 --> 18:23.760
all come from the same lineage.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.760
We all came from fish.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.520
So somewhere in you, deep down there,

18:28.520 --> 18:30.360
there's the other stuff too.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.800
It's just that you haven't been yet, by the way,

18:33.800 --> 18:35.280
because you said every new project,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.240
including maybe starting today,

18:39.560 --> 18:43.040
is an opportunity to channel, to plug into something

18:43.040 --> 18:43.880
that was always there

18:43.880 --> 18:46.080
and you haven't gotten a chance to plug into.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.400
You mentioned listening.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
How do you listen to a person?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.440
How do you hear a person?

18:51.440 --> 18:54.520
When you first come in, like we just met,

18:55.560 --> 18:57.760
what's the analysis happening?

18:57.760 --> 18:59.800
But I mean, with me is one thing.

18:59.800 --> 19:00.960
I'm an artist of sorts.

19:00.960 --> 19:05.960
I program and I'm just, I'm human, I guess.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.680
I guess we're all creating art.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.680
How do you see, like, how do I bring out?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.640
So for people who don't know,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.480
I mean, obviously everyone knows that you've produced

19:17.480 --> 19:19.040
some of the greatest records ever,

19:19.040 --> 19:24.040
but the way I see that is you just brought out the best

19:24.960 --> 19:27.520
in a lot of interesting artists.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.000
And so in order to bring out the best in them,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.320
you have to understand them.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.920
You have to hear the music of their soul,

19:37.920 --> 19:39.600
hopefully I'm not being too romantic here,

19:39.600 --> 19:44.040
but just like, is there something you can say

19:45.360 --> 19:48.400
of how difficult that is, if there's a process,

19:48.400 --> 19:51.400
if there's tricks, if it's luck?

19:52.600 --> 19:56.040
I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,

19:56.200 --> 19:59.400
like not having any preconceived ideas,

19:59.400 --> 20:01.800
being open and really listening,

20:01.800 --> 20:05.920
listening and not thinking about what you're gonna say next

20:05.920 --> 20:08.080
or what your opinion is or any, you know,

20:08.080 --> 20:11.960
not basically being a recorder

20:11.960 --> 20:14.000
and just hearing what comes in.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.120
And then once you hear what comes in,

20:16.120 --> 20:21.120
processing that information and trying our best to do that

20:22.120 --> 20:25.720
without any of the beliefs that we might have

20:25.800 --> 20:28.240
to impact what that is.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.440
You know, if I ask you a question,

20:30.440 --> 20:34.080
I don't wanna listen to you

20:34.080 --> 20:38.000
and have any reaction happening when you're speaking.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.120
I wanna be as neutral as possible.

20:41.120 --> 20:46.120
For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,

20:46.960 --> 20:48.920
it's to understand.

20:48.920 --> 20:52.440
So if anything, I would draw you out further

20:52.440 --> 20:55.920
and just ask questions to really understand.

20:56.920 --> 21:01.920
And if you say something that somehow triggers me

21:03.280 --> 21:08.280
in a way that, you know, I wonder how he came to that.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.480
I wouldn't challenge you.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.440
I would ask, like, how did you find that?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.880
You know, how did you get to that place?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.360
Form a place of curiosity.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.280
You would try to figure out.

21:17.280 --> 21:20.320
Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is

21:20.360 --> 21:22.680
and through questioning, we can usually get there

21:22.680 --> 21:26.200
or through just spending time together,

21:26.200 --> 21:29.280
you find out who the person is.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.760
What about finding out and figuring out

21:31.760 --> 21:33.520
how to then take the next steps

21:33.520 --> 21:36.080
of bringing out the best in them?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.040
Like, is it just trial and error?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.280
Like, let's try this.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.840
It's definitely trial and error.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.240
It's always trial and error.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.720
Are you afraid of making a mistake?

21:46.720 --> 21:48.760
Like, let's add this instrument,

21:48.760 --> 21:50.440
let's remove this instrument.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.640
Let's try. Let's add this line,

21:51.640 --> 21:52.560
let's remove this line.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.400
Let's try.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.400
And let's be open.

21:55.400 --> 21:59.840
So one of the, we don't really have rules,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.200
but one of the agreements in the studio

22:02.200 --> 22:07.200
is any idea that anyone has will always demonstrate it,

22:07.840 --> 22:09.640
will always try it.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.000
Because I can describe to you an idea

22:12.000 --> 22:14.520
and you can think, that's a terrible idea,

22:14.520 --> 22:16.400
let's not do that.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.080
And then I can play you the idea

22:18.080 --> 22:19.600
and then you can say, oh, that's really good.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.760
And it's completely different.

22:20.760 --> 22:25.120
Because when we're told something,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.880
we have to imagine what that is.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.960
And the way you see something and imagine it

22:30.960 --> 22:32.320
and the way I see something and imagine it

22:32.320 --> 22:33.520
are completely different.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.440
So you say a thing and now there's two humans

22:36.440 --> 22:39.240
that play that thing in their mind differently

22:39.240 --> 22:40.760
in their imagination.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.080
And then there's a cool creative step

22:43.080 --> 22:44.680
and when you actually do it

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
to see how it differs in the imagination.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.240
And then the difference or the commonality

22:49.240 --> 22:52.120
will be like an exciting little discovery together.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.040
Well, so many groups of people

22:55.040 --> 22:57.200
making things together in a room,

22:57.200 --> 22:59.240
one person will suggest something

22:59.240 --> 23:00.800
and someone else in the room saying,

23:00.800 --> 23:01.880
that doesn't sound like a good idea,

23:01.880 --> 23:02.720
let's not do that.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.640
And then they move on.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.800
The testing of every idea is really important.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.800
And that's how you get to see,

23:09.800 --> 23:11.640
oh, that's not at all what I thought it was gonna be.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.800
Happens to me all the time.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.640
I know because someone will suggest,

23:15.640 --> 23:16.760
why don't we do it like this?

23:16.760 --> 23:19.760
And I'll think that sounds bad.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.280
And then I'll think, okay, let's try it.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.120
And then we hear it.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.560
And then eight times out of 10,

23:24.560 --> 23:26.680
it's nothing like I imagined and great.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.560
And you try not to have an ego about the fact

23:30.560 --> 23:33.520
that you thought it was not a good idea in your head.

23:33.520 --> 23:36.840
There can't be any ego in this.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.680
It doesn't,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.920
if everyone's there with the purpose

23:43.920 --> 23:45.800
of making the best thing we can,

23:48.000 --> 23:49.240
there's nothing else.

23:49.240 --> 23:51.960
There are no, there can't be any boundaries to that.

23:53.560 --> 23:56.040
So there's a moment I saw with,

23:56.040 --> 23:59.360
I know you don't love talking about

23:59.360 --> 24:00.880
previous things you've done,

24:00.880 --> 24:02.800
but it's cool to dive in there every once in a while.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.080
I'm fine to talk about anything.

24:04.080 --> 24:04.920
To sample it.

24:05.840 --> 24:06.880
Anything?

24:06.880 --> 24:07.720
We'll see.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.200
I have this pain I gotta talk about.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.520
I'll think of something ridiculous

24:12.520 --> 24:14.880
that would make you change your mind.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.880
You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay-Z

24:19.880 --> 24:23.400
working on 99 Problems where you suggested a cappella

24:23.400 --> 24:25.400
opening the song with a cappella.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.120
Just no instruments, just voice.

24:28.120 --> 24:33.120
That to me, I mean, that's one of the characteristics

24:33.400 --> 24:36.720
of the things, of the ways you've brought out the best

24:36.720 --> 24:38.680
in artists is doing less.

24:38.720 --> 24:43.160
Sort of the tending towards simplicity in some kind of way.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.680
So that choice of a cappella is really interesting

24:45.680 --> 24:47.600
because I could see a lot of people think

24:47.600 --> 24:49.280
that that's a bad idea,

24:50.200 --> 24:52.280
but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.

24:52.280 --> 24:55.440
Can you maybe talk about the simplicity,

24:55.440 --> 24:56.720
how to find simplicity,

24:56.720 --> 24:58.920
why you find simplicity is beautiful.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.840
It does appear to be beautiful.

25:00.840 --> 25:01.880
What is that?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.840
Yeah, I don't know where it comes from.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.440
It has been with me from the beginning of my work,

25:07.480 --> 25:10.840
the very first album I ever produced,

25:10.840 --> 25:12.880
the credit I took was reduced by me

25:12.880 --> 25:16.120
instead of produced by me for that reason.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.520
Like I like the idea of getting to the essential

25:19.520 --> 25:24.520
and I have a better idea now that I've done it for a while,

25:24.600 --> 25:28.920
but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.

25:28.920 --> 25:33.120
And part of it is a sonic, there's a sonic benefit,

25:33.120 --> 25:36.440
which is the less elements you have,

25:38.200 --> 25:40.920
you can hear each of the ones that are there

25:40.920 --> 25:42.920
and they can sound better.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.280
And the less there are,

25:44.280 --> 25:47.680
the more space they could have around them

25:47.680 --> 25:49.920
and the more you can hear their personality.

25:49.920 --> 25:54.920
If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part

25:55.440 --> 25:58.720
and you listen to it, it would sound like guitar.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.760
And if you record one person playing a guitar part,

26:02.800 --> 26:05.600
it sounds like a person playing the guitar.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.440
It's different than just guitar.

26:08.360 --> 26:13.360
And often in the studio, the idea of building upon things

26:14.560 --> 26:18.480
and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,

26:18.480 --> 26:23.480
sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.520
So a lot of it is counterintuitive

26:27.520 --> 26:31.040
until you just in practice see what works.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.760
To try removing stuff until it's just right.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.120
It's the Einstein thing,

26:37.960 --> 26:40.840
make it as simple as possible, but not simpler.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.440
That's such a, like finding a stopping place,

26:44.440 --> 26:47.880
just keep chopping away and chopping away.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.800
There's something we also like to do called

26:49.800 --> 26:52.440
the Ruthless Edit, which is, let's say you're at a point

26:52.440 --> 26:55.120
where it can work for anything,

26:55.120 --> 26:57.320
but I'll give you the example with an album.

26:58.000 --> 27:02.600
We've recorded 25 songs.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.120
We think the album is gonna have 10.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.120
Instead of picking our favorite 10,

27:08.120 --> 27:11.920
we limit it to what are the five or six

27:11.920 --> 27:13.280
that we can't live without.

27:14.320 --> 27:19.320
So going past even the goal to get to the real like heart

27:20.280 --> 27:22.520
of it and then see, okay, we have these five or six

27:22.520 --> 27:24.320
that we can't live without.

27:24.320 --> 27:28.240
Now, what would we add to that

27:28.240 --> 27:31.240
that makes it better and not worse?

27:34.800 --> 27:38.600
It's just, it puts you in a different frame

27:38.600 --> 27:42.880
when you start with building instead of removing.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.440
And you might find that there's nothing you need to add.

27:45.440 --> 27:48.920
Sometimes, sometimes something happens

27:48.920 --> 27:51.400
when you get to the real essence.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.760
Then when you start adding things back,

27:52.760 --> 27:56.840
it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be

27:56.840 --> 27:59.160
this tight little thing.

28:00.160 --> 28:02.240
Can I ask you like a therapy session question?

28:02.240 --> 28:05.680
So you mentioned somewhere that one way

28:05.680 --> 28:09.960
to kind of think about music to get into music

28:09.960 --> 28:12.960
is to look at the top, like 100 albums of all time

28:12.960 --> 28:15.800
and just go down the list and like just take it all in

28:15.800 --> 28:17.680
like one piece of artwork.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.120
So I was doing that for a while.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.400
It's a cool experiment because unfortunately

28:23.040 --> 28:24.280
I have to admit I've gotten lazy

28:24.280 --> 28:28.080
and stopped taking in albums as albums.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.800
And I looked at one interesting top 100 list,

28:32.800 --> 28:36.920
top 500 actually, which is put together by Rolling Stone.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.840
And they put, this is the therapy session part.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.360
And this has to do with simplicity too.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.160
They put Marvin Gaye's What's Going On at number one.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.000
Spoiler alert.

28:46.120 --> 28:51.000
So I'd like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.520
The reason that Marvin Gaye is really interesting,

28:54.760 --> 28:57.760
it'd actually be cool to play What's Going On in a second.

28:57.760 --> 29:02.640
But when you just listen to his like acapella,

29:02.640 --> 29:06.080
just listen to his voice, it is really good.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.600
Like people, it makes me wonder if it's possible

29:09.600 --> 29:13.200
to pull off like most of his songs with no instruments.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.800
Like in many parts, there's so much soul

29:17.840 --> 29:21.840
in just Mercy, Mercy Me, What's Going On.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.720
There's so many songs that you could just be like,

29:23.720 --> 29:28.200
I wonder if you could just like, just go raw

29:28.200 --> 29:30.400
or maybe in parts or maybe do what you do with Jay-Z,

29:30.400 --> 29:31.440
just open up with nothing.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.960
Anyway, there's something so powerful though,

29:33.960 --> 29:36.200
great soulful voice.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.800
Do you mind if I play it real quick?

29:37.800 --> 29:38.640
No, please.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.480
What's going on?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.360
This is probably one of my favorite songs.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.440
I mean, it's up there.

29:43.560 --> 29:44.880
Hey, what's happening?

29:45.880 --> 29:48.320
Hey, I got it, I can take it right off.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.120
Momma that voice

30:02.120 --> 30:05.600
There's too many love You've got

30:08.760 --> 30:11.840
ti brother, brother, brother

30:11.840 --> 30:14.520
There's far too many love you've got

30:14.520 --> 30:16.920
There's some just very subtle backing vocals.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.720
This one hurts.

30:33.420 --> 30:35.220
Father, father, we don't need to escalate.

30:35.220 --> 30:37.420
I wonder who the father he's talking about is.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.420
Oh, that's interesting.

30:39.420 --> 30:46.320
I mean, I have, so for people who don't know his, his own father ended up killing Marvin Gaye.

30:46.420 --> 30:46.820
Yeah.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.820
I mean, that one is really pain.

30:49.820 --> 30:53.820
I mean, for a lot of people, your relationship with your father, your mother, I mean, there's

30:53.820 --> 30:58.420
different dynamics, but there's, it's almost like part of like, you know, the, the, the

30:58.620 --> 31:02.220
I mean, for a lot of people, your relationship with your father, your mother, I mean, there's

31:02.220 --> 31:06.720
different dynamics, but there's, it's almost like part of life is resolving some kind of

31:06.820 --> 31:11.320
complex puzzle you have with the people you love, the people close to you, or the people

31:11.320 --> 31:13.120
who are not there, all those kinds of things.

31:14.220 --> 31:17.620
That's so much pain in that we don't need to escalate father, father.

31:17.820 --> 31:21.820
I never thought if it's, I always thought it's his father directly.

31:22.020 --> 31:23.120
Yeah, I don't get that.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.020
It could be, but I don't, I feel like it's a more

31:31.020 --> 31:32.920
masculine spirituality.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.020
Like a father figure or just broadly some kind of spirituality.

31:37.120 --> 31:43.320
Could be like God, father God, mother God, you know, like could be, I don't know.

31:44.020 --> 31:48.220
But there's, there's so much, it's like both hope and melancholy.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.220
You're saying war's not the answer.

31:51.220 --> 31:55.320
It's like you, you don't tell your father, war's not your, your blood father.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.320
War's not the answer.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.620
It's strange conversation.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.920
It's a bigger conversation than a personal.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.420
Don't you think it feels like war?

32:03.720 --> 32:10.720
If one is personal, what's the difference between is the war is personal too.

32:11.020 --> 32:14.220
It's only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense.

32:14.420 --> 32:14.720
Yeah.

32:14.820 --> 32:19.120
When people that fight wars, you lose your brothers, you lose.

32:19.120 --> 32:21.220
I mean, death is just right there.

32:21.420 --> 32:22.620
So it might feel just like that.

32:22.620 --> 32:27.320
But yeah, there is a dance between like the personal and like talking to the

32:27.320 --> 32:28.620
entirety of the society.

32:28.620 --> 32:29.320
It's like John Lennon.

32:29.320 --> 32:36.320
Imagine like also a song where is that, is that a hopeful?

32:36.820 --> 32:37.920
Is that cynical?

32:39.020 --> 32:41.320
Is it like melancholy?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.420
Like heartbroken?

32:43.420 --> 32:47.720
Like you, you hope you wish things would be a certain way and they're not.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.220
Yeah, I don't know.

32:49.220 --> 32:52.120
I don't know if John Lennon is giving up on the world in imagine.

32:52.620 --> 32:53.520
Yeah, I don't know.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.420
No, it's, it's an interesting question.

32:55.420 --> 33:03.320
There's another John Lennon lyric in, let me think of what it is.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.220
Take me a second.

33:08.820 --> 33:11.220
And different songs keep coming into my head.

33:11.220 --> 33:14.020
It's not the one that I'm looking and you keep pressing next.

33:18.720 --> 33:19.920
Across the universe.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.120
Nothing's going to change my world.

33:25.120 --> 33:33.620
And when I hear that, I hear it as hopeless, but I don't think, I don't

33:33.620 --> 33:38.520
believe that that's, well, it may be how he meant it, but I don't think

33:38.520 --> 33:40.320
that's how it's normally taken.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.820
And it's also the taker is important.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.520
I'm generally optimistic and hopeful.

33:47.520 --> 33:51.520
So I always like look for the hope in the, actually the harshest

33:51.620 --> 33:55.820
love, uh, heartbreak songs are always somehow hopeful to me.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.020
That's a love song.

33:57.720 --> 34:05.120
Uh, to me, like a song about losing love is, is a song about the great

34:05.120 --> 34:07.320
capacity for love and the human heart.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.320
That's what I hear.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.520
To me, losing love is exciting.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.820
Cause it's like, that means you really cared.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.920
That means you felt something and you feel something you can sit in that

34:17.920 --> 34:21.920
pain and that pain is a reminder of what it means to be human when you're

34:21.920 --> 34:28.620
that, um, what is it, uh, we're just listening, uh, the only man who could

34:28.620 --> 34:30.120
ever reach me as a son of a preacher man.

34:30.320 --> 34:34.020
So it's the, um, it's like that early love or something with partially sexual

34:34.020 --> 34:36.420
or whatever, that's not as interesting to me.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.020
It's fun.

34:37.020 --> 34:37.620
It's great.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.120
That's that heartbreak.

34:39.220 --> 34:40.920
That's the reminder that can go deep.

34:41.320 --> 34:42.620
Although that's a damn good song.

34:43.120 --> 34:47.720
Have you ever heard the Detroit mix of the Marvin Gaye album?

34:48.220 --> 34:48.420
No.

34:50.320 --> 34:50.820
Call it up.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.020
By far better.

34:54.920 --> 34:55.420
Mind blowing.

34:55.420 --> 34:56.420
I just heard it recently.

34:56.420 --> 34:57.120
Blew my mind.

35:03.220 --> 35:03.820
Oh, wow.

35:04.020 --> 35:04.520
Reverb.

35:06.020 --> 35:06.520
Distant.

35:11.120 --> 35:11.620
Interesting.

35:12.620 --> 35:13.120
Yeah.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.220
It's like, it's all around the room more.

35:37.120 --> 35:39.220
More voices, more voices.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.620
He's layering his own vocals.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.120
It feels like there's multiple people singing.

36:09.220 --> 36:09.720
Yeah.

36:21.320 --> 36:22.220
Yeah, it's beautiful.

36:22.320 --> 36:22.820
Yeah.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.220
Seems to have more energy.

36:24.420 --> 36:27.620
If you, if you listen to the whole album, even, even though you just said

36:27.620 --> 36:31.320
you don't listen to albums anymore, the Detroit mix of the whole album

36:31.720 --> 36:33.220
changes the album a lot.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.420
I mean, that, that felt, uh, so that's the opposite of a

36:37.420 --> 36:38.720
cappella, I would say.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.320
Yes.

36:39.520 --> 36:43.120
Cause it's saying it's, it's, it's, um, there's layers.

36:43.120 --> 36:47.920
There's, um, and, and that maybe, I don't know if you remember, but

36:48.920 --> 36:53.420
if memory serves me, uh, correct here, he produces this own album here.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.120
Marvin Gaye was the producer on this, I believe.

36:56.120 --> 36:56.820
I believe so.

36:56.820 --> 37:01.020
And this one sounds more like it's a get together and the whole album

37:01.020 --> 37:04.620
sounds more like a get together where it's a group of people in a room

37:04.920 --> 37:06.120
playing music together.

37:06.720 --> 37:11.720
Whereas the album version sounds more like an out, like a recording.

37:12.020 --> 37:14.620
This sounds less like a recording and a little more like a party.

37:15.820 --> 37:18.920
Now you had a series of conversations with Paul McCartney, which is amazing

37:18.920 --> 37:23.520
that people should, should watch, but is, is there, this is continuing

37:23.520 --> 37:24.620
our therapy session.

37:24.720 --> 37:30.120
Is there a case to be made that, uh, what's going on as number one album

37:30.220 --> 37:35.120
above the Beatles, uh, white album or Abbey road above pet sounds?

37:36.020 --> 37:37.620
Can you still manage case?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.320
There's always a case.

37:39.420 --> 37:43.620
I mean, there's always a case every, there's no, uh, in reality in art,

37:43.620 --> 37:48.220
there is no, um, there's no metric that makes sense.

37:48.220 --> 37:53.920
So, um, you could put numbers on things, but it's like, is this apple

37:53.920 --> 37:55.320
better than this peach?

37:55.720 --> 37:58.820
Like, it's not really a fair comparison.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.720
But if you just had to keep one to represent the human species,

38:02.720 --> 38:05.720
that's the way I think to the aliens.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
So I think it's a very personal decision.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.020
I don't, I think you can make, you can make your choice to represent

38:11.220 --> 38:13.420
the human species and I'll make mine, you know?

38:13.720 --> 38:16.220
Well, I would pick the Beatles over the beach boys.

38:16.220 --> 38:19.520
So that's my, if I became dictator of the world and was talking to the

38:19.520 --> 38:23.120
aliens, but I don't know the full historical context to the impact of

38:23.120 --> 38:27.320
the music, I don't know if that's something to consider, like this

38:27.320 --> 38:31.920
kind of thought experiment of imagine what it was like back then.

38:32.820 --> 38:37.920
To create, to go into the studio, to do such interesting work in the studio.

38:38.920 --> 38:44.120
Um, as opposed to like listening to just as, as a pop song almost from is

38:44.120 --> 38:50.220
that I've never been able to understand, uh, beach boys, God only knows.

38:51.520 --> 38:54.820
The song that only knows God only knows, but all of it, that the

38:54.820 --> 39:01.720
album, the pet songs in my room was, uh, in my room, that song, uh,

39:02.220 --> 39:06.020
is, is that, what's your favorite on the album that sounds album?

39:06.020 --> 39:08.320
That sounds, um, the opening track.

39:09.420 --> 39:10.320
Do you mind if I play it?

39:10.320 --> 39:10.820
Please.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.720
It's, it's, it's too fun.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.320
That's part of their trip though.

39:19.620 --> 39:22.620
The, you, uh, you open the heart with the fun.

39:25.620 --> 39:26.420
It's possible.

39:27.320 --> 39:30.520
Original mono and stereo mix versions.

39:31.220 --> 39:32.420
What's the opening song?

39:32.520 --> 39:33.520
Wouldn't it be nice?

39:33.620 --> 39:34.720
Yeah, that's the song.

39:56.420 --> 40:08.620
This part is good, man.

40:11.420 --> 40:12.320
And then back to fun.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.820
We could say good night and stay together.

40:16.120 --> 40:16.920
Wouldn't that be nice?

40:17.220 --> 40:19.120
Wouldn't it be nice to wake up together?

40:19.720 --> 40:20.420
But we're not.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.320
There's heartbreak in this one too.

40:24.320 --> 40:29.220
So to me, like George Harris, like, um, uh, is that the album?

40:29.220 --> 40:31.020
What, while my guitar gently weeps?

40:32.220 --> 40:37.920
I mean that, um, with the Beatles, it's so hard to, depending on the day.

40:38.020 --> 40:39.920
I'll, I'll, I'll say a very different song.

40:39.920 --> 40:43.220
That's my favorite song, but I often return to while my guitar

40:43.220 --> 40:45.020
gently weeps is my favorite song.

40:45.020 --> 40:45.720
Spectacular.

40:46.020 --> 40:46.620
It's spectacular.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.020
And anything George Harrison, honestly, something, something

40:49.020 --> 40:50.020
in the way she moves.

40:50.820 --> 40:52.320
The bet I, what would you classify that?

40:52.320 --> 40:55.520
There's like several Beatles songs, categories of Beatles songs.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.720
So that's like the melancholy love songs or ballads or something like that.

40:59.820 --> 41:03.020
Um, yesterday, let it be.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.320
What's, do you have favorites?

41:06.420 --> 41:10.220
So from your, like, how have you changed as a man, as a human being, as a

41:10.220 --> 41:16.120
musician and music producer ever having done that lengthy interaction with,

41:16.420 --> 41:17.220
with McCartney?

41:17.520 --> 41:24.120
Anytime you're around someone who's such a hero and you spend time with

41:24.120 --> 41:28.320
them and they're a human being, it helps put perspective on everything.

41:28.620 --> 41:29.820
You know, that they're just human.

41:29.920 --> 41:35.120
Well, obviously, I mean, every, everyone's just human and, um, but I

41:35.120 --> 41:38.520
remember the first time I got to see Paul McCartney play live, it was in

41:38.520 --> 41:43.520
a stadium of 70,000 people and he started playing and I started playing

41:43.620 --> 41:49.020
70,000 people and he started playing and I started crying and I couldn't

41:49.020 --> 41:53.520
believe I was in, even with 70,000 people, I couldn't believe that this

41:53.520 --> 41:59.020
man walks the earth and that I'm in the same place as him and he's the

41:59.020 --> 42:01.320
person who wrote that and played that.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.120
And now he's here playing it for us.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.420
It's mind blowing.

42:06.020 --> 42:07.020
That's the voice.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.420
That's the, it's overwhelming.

42:11.420 --> 42:18.420
Is it inspiring or is it, um, like, cause sometimes when you have, and

42:18.420 --> 42:22.920
I've gotten a chance to me, I mean, I love people in general, like every,

42:22.920 --> 42:26.420
every person is fascinating to me, but yeah, when you've been a fan for

42:26.420 --> 42:31.520
a long time and you meet a person, I sort of, uh, I'll just remove present

42:31.520 --> 42:37.620
company is you, um, it's like, oh, they're just human.

42:37.620 --> 42:40.920
So there's both, it's both inspiring that just a simple human can

42:40.920 --> 42:46.120
achieve such beautiful things, but it's also like almost wishing there

42:46.120 --> 42:48.620
were gods moving around us.

42:49.620 --> 42:50.920
It's somehow peaceful.

42:51.320 --> 42:56.820
It's just, it's more, uh, comforting to know that there's, you know, uh,

42:56.820 --> 42:58.020
there's bigger fish.

42:58.120 --> 43:02.220
I'm, I'm just a small fish and then there's bigger fish and they will

43:02.220 --> 43:03.720
take care of the ocean for us.

43:03.820 --> 43:05.620
And they will take care of the ocean for us.

43:05.720 --> 43:08.520
I think we're all capable of being big fish.

43:08.620 --> 43:11.020
I don't, I don't think that there are special people.

43:11.220 --> 43:12.620
I don't think it it's like that.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.620
I would make a case.

43:15.720 --> 43:21.420
So the variety of artists that you worked with and brought the best

43:21.420 --> 43:26.120
thought of, it does seem the year out of this world.

43:27.020 --> 43:29.820
So w do you think you would know?

43:31.520 --> 43:36.620
Like if you're the same kind of specie, maybe you're just a meat

43:36.620 --> 43:39.920
vehicle and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.420
I feel like I'm channeling ideas from somewhere else.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.020
Hundred percent.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.420
But I think I asked questions about where from, I believe we all, I

43:47.420 --> 43:54.920
believe we all are though, you know, I believe we are, um, we're vehicles

43:55.720 --> 44:00.520
for information that when it's ready to come through, it comes through.

44:00.620 --> 44:03.220
And the people who have good antennas pick up the signal.

44:03.720 --> 44:07.820
But, um, if I'm sure you've had an experience in your life where you've

44:07.820 --> 44:11.920
had an idea for something and you've not acted on it and eventually

44:11.920 --> 44:14.920
someone else does it, and it's not because they're doing it because

44:14.920 --> 44:16.620
you had the idea and they stole your idea.

44:16.620 --> 44:19.920
It's because the time has come for that idea.

44:20.920 --> 44:23.920
And if you don't do it, someone else is going to do it being broadcast by

44:23.920 --> 44:24.720
whatever the sources.

44:25.720 --> 44:32.220
Uh, yeah, I tend to, I tend to see humans as not quite special in that way.

44:32.220 --> 44:32.520
Yeah.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.420
It's, it's different kinds of antennas walking around, listening to ideas

44:36.420 --> 44:41.720
and ideas that are, I like the, the notion of, uh, Richard Dawkins of

44:41.720 --> 44:46.420
memes, it's kind of the ideas of the organisms and they're just using our

44:46.420 --> 44:52.920
brains to multiply, to, to select, to compete, uh, to evolve and, and humans,

44:53.220 --> 44:56.820
and humans, we really want to hold onto the specialists of our body, of our

44:56.820 --> 44:58.820
mind, but it's, it's really the ideas.

44:59.120 --> 45:03.520
So for a group that was born two centuries ago, you wouldn't be a

45:03.520 --> 45:11.020
music producer, you'd be, or I mean, maybe, but you have an antenna and

45:11.020 --> 45:15.620
if no signals coming in, uh, or you'd be hearing a potentially a

45:15.620 --> 45:19.020
different signal, is there, um,

45:19.420 --> 45:23.420
I think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is that we, you know,

45:23.420 --> 45:28.120
maybe not everyone has tuned into their antenna to see what it is that

45:28.720 --> 45:33.320
their strength and bringing through is I'm lucky in that it found me.

45:33.320 --> 45:36.120
Cause I didn't know that it was a, I didn't even know this was a job.

45:37.020 --> 45:42.920
I sometimes wonder, I mean, a lot of young people, a lot of people wonder

45:43.020 --> 45:47.820
like, what's the purpose and the specs of my antenna?

45:49.420 --> 45:52.320
What am I put on this earth to do?

45:53.820 --> 45:58.920
Like if, um, you know, I, I can live a thousand lives, there's so many

45:58.920 --> 46:05.120
trajectories and imagine the greatest possible trajectory that reveals the

46:05.120 --> 46:09.520
most beautiful thing I can possibly create in this world, live the most

46:09.520 --> 46:10.420
beautiful way.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.720
Uh, what is that?

46:13.620 --> 46:16.020
I feel like that's a good exercise to think about.

46:17.020 --> 46:21.720
Um, cause it's also liberating to think that you can do anything.

46:22.720 --> 46:27.520
I mean that, um, more and more, I suppose that's kind of life.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.720
It's like society is pushing conformity on you.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.420
You know, I thought I had my own flavor of conformity.

46:34.420 --> 46:35.820
I thought I'm supposed to be following.

46:36.120 --> 46:40.720
And then early on, I would say like in the late twenties, you realize,

46:40.720 --> 46:44.720
wait a minute, you don't have to tell you don't have to do what teachers

46:44.820 --> 46:47.220
tell you to do what parents tell you to do.

46:47.220 --> 46:49.020
What society tells you to do.

46:49.020 --> 46:52.520
You can like, um, I would never wear a suit.

46:53.220 --> 46:58.820
If I listened to like my colleagues and community who think that a suit is

46:58.820 --> 47:04.720
like the symbol of, uh, what is it a symbol of conformity actually, which

47:04.720 --> 47:08.720
is hilarious, but, uh, it's actually a kind of rebellion and everything

47:08.720 --> 47:12.020
else like of that nature doing, doing these silly podcasts.

47:13.020 --> 47:17.920
Um, I have a question I have to ask because you brought up the suit.

47:18.020 --> 47:18.320
Yeah.

47:19.020 --> 47:21.120
Uh, do you wear the suit?

47:21.620 --> 47:24.720
Is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting?

47:25.020 --> 47:28.820
So, uh, for the longest time it was some kind of suit.

47:29.220 --> 47:35.520
And then recently, I mean, coinciding with going to Texas, there's a, I'm

47:35.520 --> 47:40.520
such a loner, I'm an introvert and there's a bit of a hiding from the

47:40.520 --> 47:50.620
world when I wear other stuff, I really want to, um, to not make fame,

47:50.620 --> 47:56.120
recognition, money, all of those things, a motivation at all.

47:57.920 --> 48:01.920
And the world kind of wants you to make those motivations and not, not the

48:01.920 --> 48:05.820
world, but I would say maybe the Western world, maybe America, maybe

48:05.820 --> 48:07.120
a capitalist system does.

48:08.120 --> 48:11.620
But that's a choice to buy into that or not.

48:13.120 --> 48:17.220
It takes a brave person, a person of character to not buy in.

48:17.220 --> 48:21.720
And I'm, I'm like a, uh, like a baby deer trying to find his legs.

48:22.020 --> 48:26.620
You don't have to buy in because I love people and I think I'm kind of an idiot.

48:26.620 --> 48:31.920
And so when other people say, do this and do that, it, uh, there's a,

48:31.920 --> 48:33.020
there is a pressure there.

48:33.420 --> 48:39.120
It's actually very difficult to not listen necessarily to the advice of

48:39.120 --> 48:43.220
others and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world.

48:44.320 --> 48:49.620
It's easy to be like, I'm always right, you know, just kind of sticking

48:49.620 --> 48:52.820
a ground, but if you want to be like vulnerable, if you want to connect

48:52.820 --> 48:56.020
with people and just wear your heart on your sleeve, then you're going

48:56.020 --> 48:56.720
to listen to them.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.320
I mean, that's the double-edged sword of it.

48:59.320 --> 49:04.320
And, uh, but then again, that pain, like if you don't let it destroy,

49:04.320 --> 49:05.920
you can grow, grow from that.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.520
Has fame affected you at all?

49:08.520 --> 49:10.520
Did you unplug from the system at some point?

49:11.120 --> 49:11.520
Same.

49:11.620 --> 49:14.120
I've always been sort of removed.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.020
I don't feel like I'm part of any system.

49:17.220 --> 49:18.920
Do you feel famous?

49:20.520 --> 49:25.120
I'm aware that when I go out, people, you know, say nice things to me,

49:25.120 --> 49:28.120
which is great, but that's about it.

49:28.720 --> 49:31.720
That's about as far as, but it doesn't affect your art about your

49:31.720 --> 49:33.520
creativity or your thoughts.

49:33.620 --> 49:37.520
Like when you're sitting alone and thinking about the world, it can't,

49:37.920 --> 49:39.720
it's a destructive force.

49:40.920 --> 49:46.920
The, the thing, the reason that you're who you are and the reason that

49:46.920 --> 49:50.520
you're finding the success you're finding is because you've been true

49:50.520 --> 49:52.320
to yourself to get to that stage.

49:52.720 --> 49:58.720
So to start changing that to conform to either conform to someone else's

49:58.720 --> 50:00.120
idea of what you should be doing.

50:01.120 --> 50:03.720
It's just seems like, uh, it doesn't make sense.

50:04.120 --> 50:06.120
Do you have a sense of who you are?

50:06.320 --> 50:07.720
Cause I don't necessarily have a.

50:08.920 --> 50:09.420
I don't know.

50:09.420 --> 50:15.020
I know that I really like making good things and I know that I'm crazy

50:15.020 --> 50:21.920
about it in that, um, it's like an obsession and I want things to be

50:21.920 --> 50:23.420
as good as they could be, whatever it is.

50:23.420 --> 50:28.620
And if I'm, if I finish a music project and I have a window of time

50:28.620 --> 50:32.620
where I'm not working on music, I might be moving the furniture

50:32.620 --> 50:33.420
around in the house.

50:33.420 --> 50:39.620
You know, I'm always looking for a prod, a creative outlet to find

50:39.620 --> 50:41.220
a way to make something better.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.420
Or there was a period of time where I was in a weird corporate

50:44.520 --> 50:52.120
situation that was, uh, that didn't allow me to flourish.

50:52.620 --> 50:57.620
And I turned, I focused the creativity in on myself and I lost a

50:57.620 --> 50:59.120
bunch of weight and changed my life.

50:59.120 --> 51:02.120
And so that was the kind of art like the, you've gone through a

51:02.120 --> 51:05.120
whole process of losing weight, getting in shape, getting healthy.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.120
That was a kind of creative act.

51:07.220 --> 51:08.220
It certainly was.

51:08.220 --> 51:12.620
It wasn't an intentional creative act, but I had a lot of energy and

51:12.620 --> 51:15.620
I just, a series of events happened.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.320
I read a book at the time.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.320
That was my heaviest.

51:19.320 --> 51:23.820
I weighed about 318 pounds and I'd never been, I'd been sedentary

51:23.820 --> 51:26.220
my whole life, basically laying on a couch working on music.

51:26.220 --> 51:30.120
So I've never been physically active in my life.

51:30.920 --> 51:34.520
And I read a book about a guy named Stu middleman, a runner who ran

51:34.520 --> 51:36.320
a thousand miles in 11 days.

51:36.820 --> 51:39.820
And I thought, wow, I, you know, get out of breath, walking to the

51:39.820 --> 51:45.020
corner and another human being can run a thousand miles in 11 days.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.520
I feel like I have bad information.

51:46.620 --> 51:49.020
You know, I'm doing, clearly I'm doing something wrong.

51:50.020 --> 51:53.520
And, um, and I reached out to a person that Stu mentioned in

51:53.520 --> 51:55.920
the book, Phil Maffetone, who was a legend.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.020
I really appreciate him as well.

51:58.020 --> 52:00.320
He's math 180 method too.

52:00.320 --> 52:04.520
He's such an interesting, I think he focuses on heart rate, uh,

52:04.620 --> 52:10.820
training and he was the first person to talk about, um, essentially,

52:10.820 --> 52:19.520
uh, low carbs, paleo keto diet 40 years ago.

52:20.320 --> 52:23.320
For a person who's going to be healthy, who can exercise and actually

52:23.320 --> 52:29.220
perform at an early level, he's the first person when I, um, you

52:29.220 --> 52:31.520
know, talking about heart rate training him and other endurance

52:31.820 --> 52:36.120
he influenced, he gave me permission to like run slower.

52:38.320 --> 52:41.720
It was the first time I realized, Oh, I can run long distances if I just

52:41.720 --> 52:44.120
run slower and then take that seriously.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.620
And I actually fell in love with the running very much so.

52:48.620 --> 52:52.120
Cause for me, everyone's different, but for me, the love of running

52:52.120 --> 52:54.120
happens in the longer distances.

52:54.820 --> 52:55.920
Did you read born to run?

52:56.820 --> 52:57.520
Great book.

52:57.620 --> 52:58.320
Amazing book.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.020
There is something special about running.

53:01.020 --> 53:04.220
And he, everybody has their own, their own journey with it.

53:04.420 --> 53:07.120
And even ultra marathon running, those kinds of things.

53:08.120 --> 53:11.620
It's a, it is like many journeys.

53:12.920 --> 53:17.220
One that can pull you in, like you won't be the same person after.

53:17.220 --> 53:20.820
And I try to be delivered about making deliberate about making

53:20.820 --> 53:24.620
choices after which you will not be the same person.

53:26.020 --> 53:29.220
And so I'm nervous about like the ultra marathon running world.

53:31.020 --> 53:35.220
Um, I had to talk to you about Johnny cash.

53:37.420 --> 53:45.620
I mean, when people ask me what my favorite musical thing is of all time.

53:47.120 --> 53:54.420
Um, you know, it's very difficult question to answer, of course, but I'm

53:54.420 --> 53:57.620
pretty quick if I'm not allowed to pick anything by Tom ways.

53:58.220 --> 54:04.920
Uh, I'm pretty quick to say, uh, hurt by Johnny cash, the performance,

54:05.220 --> 54:08.320
the, whatever you call it, whatever the heck that is, because that's not

54:08.320 --> 54:14.020
just a song covered by an artist.

54:14.520 --> 54:17.220
That's a human being at the end of their life.

54:18.720 --> 54:25.720
That the rawness of that, the, I mean, just the, there's also a music video,

54:25.820 --> 54:28.320
which for a lot of people adds a lot to it.

54:28.520 --> 54:36.320
Uh, for me, just the music alone is, I mean, the guitar, every choice on that.

54:36.620 --> 54:39.020
See the few things I've heard about it.

54:39.220 --> 54:40.920
It seemed like almost accidental.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.220
I mean, like little subtle choices here and there.

54:44.320 --> 54:45.920
Can you maybe comment on that?

54:46.420 --> 54:52.220
Um, do the, to the degree, I think you had a huge role in sort of bringing

54:52.220 --> 54:56.520
Johnny cash back from, from a different part of his life.

54:56.520 --> 54:59.520
It's like bringing something out that wasn't there before.

54:59.520 --> 55:01.720
And it was, it was, it was incredible.

55:01.720 --> 55:05.220
It was a celebration of a really special musician and that's

55:05.220 --> 55:07.220
totally new kind of celebration.

55:07.920 --> 55:09.520
Now hurt is just one of the songs.

55:09.520 --> 55:13.220
That's that's a, that's a, that's an amazing celebration of Johnny cash,

55:13.220 --> 55:16.920
but hurt is like at the, at the, uh, at the peak of that.

55:17.220 --> 55:20.720
So what was that like putting that song together?

55:21.420 --> 55:24.120
Can maybe, maybe, uh, it might be nice to listen to it.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.820
Cause I freaking love that song.

55:26.120 --> 55:34.520
And as a guitarist, I just, the simplicity of it, uh, it seems like every

55:34.520 --> 55:37.120
choice contributes to the greatness of the song.

55:37.120 --> 55:51.320
Simple, it's crisp, but it's dark too.

55:55.420 --> 55:57.620
It's one of the greatest opening lines of any song.

55:59.820 --> 56:01.020
The shade, that's that.

56:01.320 --> 56:01.620
Yeah.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.320
See if I still feel, yeah, I'm talking about the lyrics.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.020
I don't even mean the performance.

56:06.020 --> 56:18.120
The words are, but those words out of Trent Reznor are not the same.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.820
They have a different meaning coming out of Johnny cash's mouth.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.620
What have I become?

56:43.220 --> 56:45.220
Written probably for a young man.

56:46.220 --> 56:47.920
Think he was 20 when he wrote it.

56:48.520 --> 56:48.820
Trent.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.620
Anger, regret, pain.

57:18.120 --> 57:22.820
That the way the guitarist played the choice of instrument, the layers there,

57:23.320 --> 57:31.320
the, uh, the freedom to give him to use the voice that's, um, fading.

57:31.820 --> 57:32.520
It's not fading.

57:32.520 --> 57:33.320
It's changing.

57:34.020 --> 57:40.820
Maybe he's losing some aspects of his voice and it's, and it's, it's almost

57:40.820 --> 57:45.920
like shaking a little bit and it's a little bit out of tune in parts.

57:48.020 --> 57:51.020
Uh, how much of that was deliberate?

57:51.020 --> 57:55.220
How much was like, how do you give Johnny cash the freedom to do that?

57:56.020 --> 57:57.320
How do you find that together?

57:57.620 --> 57:59.020
Is there any insights you can give?

57:59.720 --> 58:05.820
I think it's a, it's a case almost of like the right pairing, the right

58:06.120 --> 58:12.320
role with the right actor, you could say the, the song lyrics, the reason

58:12.320 --> 58:16.320
we chose the song was because of the lyrics purely about the lyrics.

58:17.320 --> 58:20.420
And at that point in time, both Johnny and I would send each other songs

58:20.420 --> 58:23.420
of possible ideas to record.

58:23.420 --> 58:28.720
And, um, that was one that I sent him and he didn't respond to initially.

58:28.720 --> 58:29.120
I sent it.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.220
I would send him see it.

58:30.320 --> 58:33.620
That time we would burn CDs and I would send him like CD at 20 songs

58:33.620 --> 58:36.520
or 25 songs and then, and he would send them to me.

58:36.520 --> 58:39.620
You burn a CD for Johnny cash and you send him, uh, of different songs.

58:39.620 --> 58:42.120
I'd like songs to consider recording.

58:42.120 --> 58:42.520
Yeah.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.620
Um, and we would send these back and forth.

58:46.620 --> 58:50.920
And then that I had heard on one of the ones that I sent him

58:50.920 --> 58:51.720
and he didn't respond.

58:51.720 --> 58:55.920
And usually if he didn't respond, we didn't go back to it.

58:56.020 --> 58:59.720
You know, and that one, I remember I sent it again and I put it

58:59.720 --> 59:02.420
first on the next, on the next CD.

59:03.220 --> 59:06.920
And, um, and when, when we spoke about when he listened to CD again,

59:06.920 --> 59:07.520
he didn't respond.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.320
I said, check out that first song.

59:09.320 --> 59:11.220
And I really feel like that one could be good.

59:11.320 --> 59:12.520
What did you see in that song?

59:12.520 --> 59:13.520
Cause it's the lyrics.

59:14.020 --> 59:15.020
It's the lyrics.

59:15.120 --> 59:20.120
Cause I feel like nobody, there's very few people in the world that

59:20.120 --> 59:26.120
would see these lyrics in Johnny cash's mouth and think this is

59:26.120 --> 59:28.420
a good idea, including Trent Reznor.

59:28.520 --> 59:28.920
Yeah.

59:29.320 --> 59:32.820
I know that Trent was, Trent had trepidations in the beginning.

59:33.120 --> 59:37.220
Um, but if you listen to the words, if you forget the music and if

59:37.220 --> 59:41.220
you get what, if you forget what Nine Inch Nails sounds like, and you

59:41.220 --> 59:47.020
just read it like a poem, and then you imagine a 70 year old man

59:47.020 --> 59:51.820
reading these lyrics, it'll be, it'll be profound.

59:51.920 --> 59:52.720
It's profound.

59:53.220 --> 59:58.020
So that was the based on lyrics that started the journey.

59:58.020 --> 01:00:01.320
And then at this point in time, Johnny was not in great health.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:06.520
And, uh, sometimes I would go to Nashville and record with him at his

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.920
house, sometimes he would come to California, but he was coming to

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:15.620
California less regularly and because there was, there were so many

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:21.220
songs we wanted to try, he would start sometimes recording just a straight

01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.920
acoustic version, like you'd have someone play guitar, he would sing

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.420
and they would send those to me and we would discuss like, is this one

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.220
to build on?

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.120
Um, and that was when we said, I don't want to record this one

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.020
until we're together.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.520
I feel like we should do this one together.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:41.820
So on the next trip to California, we recorded it at my, at my old house.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:53.020
And I mean, all the songs we recorded felt special.

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.220
So I can't say this one felt special, but lyrically, it just, it's more

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:06.720
the lyrics have such a profound sense of regret.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.420
What have I become?

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.020
Yeah.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.620
And to hear when you're 20 years old, talking about regret, it's

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:17.220
heartbreaking, but it's heartbreaking in a different way because you have

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.620
a whole life to figure it out.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.720
When you're looking back over your life at the end of your life with

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.920
regret, it's brutal.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:26.220
It's brutal.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.920
So that was the initial spark of doing it.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:36.820
And then when we recorded it, I believe it was, um, two guitar

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:41.820
players, if I remember correctly, maybe even three, um, Smokey

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:47.220
Hormel, Matt Sweeney and Mike Campbell, I believe.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:52.620
And Ben Montenge was playing the piano in my living room as we were doing it.

01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:59.520
And we cut the basic track and with Johnny singing, and then Johnny

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.720
probably sang over that basic track a few more times.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:11.020
And then we comped his vocal and then, uh, built up the drama and you

01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:13.720
didn't get to the part, but at the end of the song, it gets very loud.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.820
The music gets very loud.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.620
It's subtle because it's not anything that takes your ear and the vocal

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.420
is so powerful that you don't really think about what's going on.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.620
It's building and it even gets distorted at the end.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:33.920
It gets really, uh, like over, overpowering.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.820
And that's part of the emotion of it.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:36.320
Yeah.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.620
I hear almost anger and frustration.

01:02:49.620 --> 01:03:15.120
And it just rings out the clean vocal.

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.820
I mean, it's so simple, so incredible.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:23.820
And it's interesting to have a young man's lyrics in an old Johnny

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.620
Cash voice and heart and mind.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.220
I had, um, are you a fan of Tom Waits?

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:30.920
Of course.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.920
Uh, Tom Waits was younger had his song called Martha, but there's a

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.720
bunch of songs he's written when he was young was like, how does a

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.620
young man have that like melancholy wisdom?

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:51.020
The song Martha is about, uh, an older man calling a woman he used to

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:55.320
love that she's now married and he's married and they're having that

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.020
conversation.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:59.720
They haven't spoken for 30 years and they realized that they're still

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.720
loved there and it could have been a different life, a different world

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.820
where they could have been together.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.720
And here's like a 23 year old Tom Waits writing so beautifully about

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.020
something that's very, uh, I've had a lot of people like tell me how

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.320
real that, uh, as an older person looking back at that love that you

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.420
had and realizing it wasn't, it was really, it's still there in clings

01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.720
of that love are still there.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:39.020
I think there's a, um, when a young person writes a sad song, they

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.520
almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place because they

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:49.120
have, they have a lot of journey ahead and older artists tend to

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.720
want to look at the bright side of things, which, which also I think

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.320
comes from the wisdom of aging.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:56.320
It's, it's a more realistic position.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.220
So it's not uncommon for younger people to write, I think even in

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:09.720
the Beatles, you'll see like they're very heavy lyrics, um, middle to

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.420
late era Beatles, which is still, you know, they're in their 20, you

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:14.720
know, early twenties, I guess.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.820
Uh, that's hard to think about so much accomplished.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:18.520
Unbelievable.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:24.320
And they, they went through the full journey from fun to darkness

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.120
in the span of a few years.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.620
Uh, you mentioned lyrics.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.120
Um, so you've obviously produced albums with incredible lyrics.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.220
I think you've mentioned that the interesting characteristics of

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:45.220
hip hop of rap is that you're writing poetry to rhythm versus writing

01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.520
poetry to melody.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.120
So that's like one way to think about it.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.520
And I'm a fan.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.820
I mean, Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, I'm a fan of poetry period.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:06:02.220
Um, is there something, um, about highlighting the poetry of it?

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.220
The power of words you did with, with hurt.

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:10.320
If, uh, like if I have to play it again, it's one, uh, a Tom Waits

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.720
song that's like less than a minute long that I've always go back to.

01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.920
It's one I really love.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.520
And it has just a few lines.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.620
It's called, I want you.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.320
All it is, is him saying, I want you.

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:37.520
I want you, you, you.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.920
This is a 22 year old Tom Waits.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:45.120
All I want is you, you, you.

01:06:45.420 --> 01:07:03.220
All I want is you, give you stars above, sun on the brightest day.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.820
Give you all my love.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:24.520
If only you would say that I want you, you, you, all I want is you.

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.920
And then he hums for 20 more seconds.

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.420
Beautiful.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.720
So, so some, man, that young man, like low.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.920
And for people who don't know Tom Waits, you should definitely listen to him.

01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:37.620
His voice sounds very different now.

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.620
And it's interesting to see the evolution of a human voice.

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:47.020
Uh, the artists over time, because that's a young, like boy, like

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:53.420
voice, hopeful, less clever, less witty, more simple that simplicity is there.

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:58.020
And he's not, I mean, that takes guts to be so simple, I would say

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.620
lyrically and, uh, musically is there, um, sort of laying that out on

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:11.320
the table, is there ways to, that you like to highlight the voice, the

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:16.420
lyrics, or is there's no one rule?

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.620
So do you, what is the thing that makes music special?

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:26.420
Is it the rhythm, the melody, the, uh, or is ultimately the lyrics

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.320
are always there or the idea?

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:29.920
You just asked me five different questions.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.320
It's not about you.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:36.820
You don't want the answers.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.020
I'll listen.

01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:45.420
Uh, I look forward to your comments, the internet.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:45.820
Okay.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:50.420
You have the greatest producer of all time in front of you.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.820
I know you can't shut the hell up.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.620
That's right.

01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:53.320
Friends.

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:57.020
Uh, is, but you do value lyrics.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.820
Is there a way to celebrate lyrics?

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:01.420
I value lyrics if the lyrics are important.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:03.220
I'm not a lyric person.

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:08.920
I'm very much, uh, whatever the thing that makes the thing good is the

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.020
thing that I'm drawn to for me.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.220
Um, for a long time, lyrics meant very little.

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.820
I would say from the beginning.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:18.520
Yes.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.420
From the earliest days for your right to party.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:22.220
Beastie boys.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.820
Yeah, it was, it was fun.

01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:27.220
I thought they were good lyrics, but it wasn't what was important.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.520
I mean, it was in a, in a, almost a novelty way, not in a serious way.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:39.620
Early in my career, I was much more focused on the rhythm first, the

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:45.320
rhythm, and I would, if the lyrics weren't good enough, I would be

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.020
aware of it, but it wasn't the driving force for me.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.420
And eventually over time, then melody became an important piece, which

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:53.620
it wasn't in the beginning.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:59.720
And then, uh, lyrics became more important over time, but it's always

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.320
been, uh, always changing what, what draws me in.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.220
And one of the things I found as it relates to lyrics that, that can

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:17.620
give a lyric a different power has to do with rhythm, where if there's

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.220
no drum, the lyrics tend to mean more.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.920
So earlier, what you were saying about, if it was just a cappella, you

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:32.220
felt, you felt Marvin Gaye in a different way hearing the a cappella.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:39.020
Can you comment on, I mean, in terms of one of the greatest albums ever.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.020
Why does it sound so raw?

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.920
Her voice, she's just a great singer, but this is that you're not doing

01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:00.320
anything else, you're doing the, uh, there's, there's, there's, there's

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:07.020
drumming and then there's just a single beat and then it builds.

01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:28.220
It gets simpler, but it feels like it's a giant orchestra.

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:51.320
There's backing vocals, the anger.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:54.420
I love it.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:06.520
Uh, I just, there's something about, uh, such a powerful voice and the

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:08.120
instruments not getting in the way.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.520
I mean, the same with the, with her and Johnny Cash.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:18.220
It is, is there, um, why does it sound so like raw?

01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:19.320
It's the same as the hurt.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:22.520
There's a, it feels like you're in the room with them.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.220
It feels like they're not even singing.

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.920
They're like, uh, they're literally freshly mad and angry.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.720
I think those are the things that make great singers sound like great singers.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:37.120
It's not, it's not anything that that's happening in the studio.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.020
I mean, we're, I would say the only thing that us in the studio can do is kind

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:49.720
of get out of the way and not, not ruin it, you know, it's like, that's, that's

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.120
what comes through of these, these people.

01:12:54.220 --> 01:12:59.320
I should also, before I forget, there is a lot of song choices on that CD.

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:03.120
I would love to see the full options on the CD that you sent to Johnny Cash

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:03.620
that I love.

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.720
So Solitaire Man is one of my favorite choices made there.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.720
Uh, is that, is that a Neil Diamond song?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.820
It's funny you talk about them as songs cause I tend to, I tend to listen

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.520
more to albums than songs.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.820
So you really, you're, that's what you're doing in your head.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:22.520
You're pulling up the album essentially.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.020
No, I'm like, I'm going to that song, but I don't know.

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:29.520
I've never listened to that song, but I know that when that, when that song

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:34.020
comes up in the sequence of the album, it has a really powerful effect in me.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.720
Let's see what it does if you just start it.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.320
If you could read my mind.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:58.020
Oh, so interesting.

01:13:59.220 --> 01:13:59.820
Wow.

01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:34.620
Never be set free as long as there's a ghost that you can see.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:39.920
That's beautiful.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.620
Such a beautiful choice.

01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:45.620
Beautiful melody, such a beautiful melody and haunting words.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.920
It's sung so simply.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:54.820
I have to, uh, I mean, so, uh, I was born in the Soviet Union.

01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:04.820
Uh, when, when you, when you're growing up, uh, there's a few bands that kind of,

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:11.320
I mean, they're probably forbidden still, but they seep in and you get like, uh,

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:17.120
bootlegged and they somehow take over the culture of the young, of the

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.720
young folks, such as myself.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.620
So, uh, on the metal side, it was Metallica and Iron Maiden.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:29.120
And, uh, on the, I don't know what you call them, but Beastie Boys.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.620
I remember hearing, uh, fight for your right.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:38.620
And it was just like, for some reason that stuck as it did for a lot of people in

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:43.720
Russia is like, wow, America is when you get to say, fuck you to the man, the

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:50.020
rebellion, the freedom, um, I probably heard it, uh, a few years after it was

01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:52.920
released because it kind of, it dissipates to the culture.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.720
You get the bootleg.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.820
It means hard to get your hands on, but I just remember, I mean, I, I, I

01:15:57.820 --> 01:16:01.820
wanted to kind of bring that up because it was such a personally important song

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:06.220
to me and yet probably you didn't even think of that.

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:10.220
You probably thought of it as its role in the culture here in the United States.

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:16.420
Like in terms of musically, but it was, you know, 20, 21 years old and we just,

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.820
well, you were that kid too, right?

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.820
Just making fun songs for our friends.

01:16:19.820 --> 01:16:22.920
There was no, there was no, uh, expectation.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.020
That's just a fun song.

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.320
Yeah.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.520
No one thought we would never imagined anybody would like any of it.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.320
One of the greatest albums ever.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.520
I have to, it's, I love this so much.

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:41.520
I just remember this is America.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.020
I didn't even know.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:45.020
I didn't even understand the lyrics to be honest.

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:53.020
And the lyrics are ridiculous.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:12.020
Yeah.

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:33.020
So hearing that and hearing Metallica, master puppets, I was like, I knew

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:35.420
I'm going to have to end up in America one day.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:42.940
I mean, maybe now that I'm more mature, or maybe a little bit more mature, I realized

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.580
like, that was kind of the longing for freedom.

01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:53.060
It felt like, at least at the time, if this is allowed, then anything is allowed.

01:17:53.060 --> 01:18:04.100
And I think that the rebellion of it, I guess it's also fun, I just loved it.

01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:11.660
If you look back to that, I mean, you were that person, not just the producer, it feels

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.660
like...

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.660
Well, yes and no.

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:17.460
Even to us then, it was still like satirical, you know, it wasn't...

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.460
It was.

01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:19.460
Oh, absolutely.

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:24.100
But isn't music in part, like you're dancing on the line, it's part satirical, part serious

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:29.220
in the sense, like you're losing yourself in the satire.

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:35.140
Anytime you go over the top, isn't that part of the...

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.660
Or is it explicitly satirical?

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:38.660
You make it fun?

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.140
I mean, the girls, there's a lot of ridiculous songs in that album.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.140
I don't know.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:46.420
I just think it was definitely to make each other laugh, like we were trying to make each

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420
other laugh.

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:51.940
We weren't trying to make a point, we were trying to make each other laugh.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:59.020
But that person, how's that person different than the person today in you?

01:18:59.820 --> 01:19:01.420
I wouldn't say so different.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:07.540
It really is that I like things that make me laugh, you know, I like ridiculous things.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:08.860
It's the same person still.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.420
I think so.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.420
Is it strange, just how many incredible...

01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:18.540
I mean, I don't think I would make that today, but I understand why we made it when we did.

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:26.420
It's in the vocabulary of ridiculous that would make sense to do.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:33.220
For the right artist today could make something ridiculous and gives you that feeling.

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:40.140
I mean, there's just a sense when you make so many different albums and you look back

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:45.820
at that creation, it can feel like a different person created that, but you're making it

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:51.280
seem like if you travel back in time or maybe do a memory replay, you'd be able to hang

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.840
out with a teenage in the 20s recruitment, I think it's just fine.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.680
I don't think I was so different, honestly.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:02.680
That's hilarious.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:11.320
It's funny, I ran into someone recently in Costa Rica who I hadn't seen in a long time

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:18.560
and who I knew from the New York days when, those days, and we spent a couple of hours

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.760
talking and she said, you're exactly the same person that you were then.

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:30.280
So I have a short, a recent confirmation that that's the case.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:31.440
That's beautiful.

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:35.240
Was it Tim Ferriss asked you about who was the most successful person?

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:38.000
That's the definition of success, I would say.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.760
It's exactly the same person.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:43.760
You haven't lost yourself or rather you found yourself early on.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:52.520
I would say there are aspects of me that have changed for sure, but I can't say that it's

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:57.440
necessarily better, it's different.

01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:05.720
I would say at that time I was more confident than I am now, and I'm very confident now,

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:13.660
but then I had an unrealistic confidence and I think now it's a little more based in reality

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:17.420
that at that point in time I had never been depressed.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:23.780
Then once you go through a depression, well some people, I know in my case, when I went

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:28.940
through depression afterwards I was a different person than I was before.

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:39.820
I feel more grounded now than I did then and I probably relate to the artists who, so many

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.460
of the artists I work with suffer.

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:45.860
So many artists suffer because that's part of what makes an artist great is their level

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:53.620
of sensitivity, the same thing that makes an artist uncomfortable other people don't

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:56.420
feel at all.

01:21:56.420 --> 01:22:03.560
The time you were depressed, what was the darkest moment of your life?

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.560
What took you there?

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.100
How did you get out?

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:13.540
It was triggered by a person making a comment about something to do with work that didn't

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:14.540
matter.

01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:19.220
It was like to anyone else they would hear that and it would just be like, okay, we'll

01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:21.020
deal with it next week, whatever.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:27.300
But for some reason I took it in a way that I felt like the rug had been pulled out from

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.420
under me.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:36.060
Even beyond the rational part of it, of understanding, even after the problem that came up was solved

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:42.220
it somehow undermined something in me and made me feel very vulnerable in a way that

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.700
I hadn't felt before.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.660
And it spiraled, how did you get out?

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.940
I did a lot of different kinds of therapy.

01:22:50.940 --> 01:23:00.020
I did starting with alternative therapies, I was seeing, I would say between seven and

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:17.140
eight, doctors and or therapists a week, acupuncture, talk therapy, herbs, any possible modality.

01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:26.740
Tried everything for a long time and nothing seemed to have an impact.

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:39.060
And then finally, I'm wary of taking any Western medicine, I'm not a drug taker or drinker

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:43.140
or partier in any way.

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:50.580
And I found a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic.

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:56.620
But because she was a psychic, I was okay to see her because I'll listen to a psychic.

01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:59.740
But I'm not going to listen to a psychopharmacologist.

01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:06.980
But the fact that she had the psychic, that made her fit into my worldview.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:12.820
And she recommended antidepressant, which went terribly wrong in the first night that

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.060
I took it.

01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:18.180
And then that set me on a journey of looking for the right antidepressant, which was a

01:24:18.180 --> 01:24:21.380
long and painful process.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:24.420
Everyone that I took made me sick, everyone.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.740
And then finally, I don't know, five months later, six months later, I found the magic

01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.940
one that worked for me.

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:37.020
And it shifted me out of the depression.

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:43.580
I took it for, my camera was six months or a year, and then weaned off and was okay.

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.940
And then I had another event some years later.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:51.020
I think I took it again for a short period of time and got out of it.

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:52.900
And I've not needed it since.

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:58.620
Were you able to kind of introspect the triggers that led to the events?

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:02.580
Is there something, or is it random events of life?

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:10.740
I think it's more that because of the way that I grew up, I never had to deal with much

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:14.020
controversy.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:21.700
And when I was challenged, I didn't have any ability to deal with it.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.300
It's like, you know, Jonathan Haidt talks about, it's like that.

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:30.780
So you've actually also mentioned like business sometimes gives you stress.

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.180
So this was business related stuff.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.340
Yeah, it was a business related thing.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.740
It just made me feel bad.

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:44.100
One of the sadder things about art and music is that it's often interleaved with business

01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:45.100
folk.

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:53.820
I suppose that's the way of the world if you have a capitalist system, but it makes that

01:25:53.820 --> 01:26:04.740
business folks rubbing up against artists can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul.

01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.620
To me, one of the best representations of an artist, honestly, is Johnny Ive, the designer

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:09.980
from Apple.

01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:12.660
And he's just so fragile with his ideas.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:17.460
He talked about like when he has ideas, he really wouldn't show it to Steve Jobs or anybody

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:22.860
except for the small design team because he was so nervous that it would break, but give

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:23.860
it a chance.

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:26.020
Give it a chance to grow.

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:33.780
And it seems like the outside world, business people, PR people, people that kind of have

01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:39.940
not lost themselves in the passion of creating, but instead are kind of representing or like

01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:42.420
making deals, all that kind of stuff.

01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:48.980
They can kind of trample on those little ideas, and it's sad to see.

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:53.220
It's really heartbreaking to see because you know how much trampling there's going on.

01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.700
It's one of the main jobs.

01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:04.140
My job as a record producer is to keep the voices away from the artist, from all the

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:11.220
people who are really on their side but don't know, whether it be people, anyone on the

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:17.460
business side who doesn't make things, they're excited to do their part.

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:18.460
They're excited.

01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:25.420
When you deliver the art that you make to me, then we can start the project.

01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:31.500
But there's nothing to sell if the art doesn't happen in the right way and it has to be protected

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:39.100
and it can't happen on the same kind of a timetable that business can.

01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:40.900
It's just a different thing.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:44.180
Art doesn't come in a quarterly way.

01:27:44.180 --> 01:27:49.260
That doesn't apply just to music or it applies to art, it applies to all creative pursuits.

01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:54.540
This is generally the case at MIT.

01:27:54.540 --> 01:28:00.540
There's the administration and then there is the professors and students.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:03.300
The professors and students are the creative folk.

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:04.300
They create stuff.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:05.300
They dream.

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.820
They have wild ideas that go on tangents and so on.

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:14.220
They have hopes and they go with those and they get on these weird, passionate pursuits

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:20.020
and then the administration can often just trample on that.

01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:28.740
They set up bars in all kinds of ways that you think you're not actually hurting but

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:31.740
you really are.

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:36.900
I won't mention why because this happens to everybody and I have a large amount of leverage

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:45.420
at MIT now but even I get a little bit of pressure in such stupid ways.

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:46.620
Be careful.

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.620
Be careful.

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.980
We really want your career to succeed.

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:50.980
Be careful.

01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:55.940
That little pressure to an artist, do you want to go a cappella?

01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:59.200
Do you want to do a country record?

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:00.200
Be careful.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.700
You're already a superstar.

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.700
Be careful.

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:08.900
And then in that way, you kind of push people like flock of fish into one fish tank where

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:14.660
they're all the same and it's sad to see and it's obviously in the modern world, there's

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:19.740
nice mechanism to protect, to let artists flourish a little bit more because they get

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:24.180
to put themselves to the world and get a little bit more confidence, maybe different funding

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.780
mechanisms, all that kind of stuff.

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:27.780
Tremendous problem.

01:29:27.780 --> 01:29:32.500
The voices that don't understand interfering with the process is huge.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:39.020
The other side of it is in success, there can be a lack of reality where all of the

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:43.300
people around the successful person just tell them everything they do is great and then

01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:53.340
they don't have anything to bump up against anymore or have a realistic sense of how things

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:59.460
work or how things measure.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:08.340
So both sides are really important, both avoiding the voices getting in the way and having a

01:30:08.340 --> 01:30:15.660
trusted group of a sangha, a group of people who can say, you know, I don't know if that's

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:20.780
as good and you can still say, I don't care what you think, that's fine, but it helps

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.780
to hear it.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:31.340
It helps to have, if someone who you respect tells you something isn't good enough, it's

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:32.340
helpful.

01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:35.900
When you know it comes from a place of love, when it comes from a place of wisdom.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:40.780
And not from a place of fear, not from a place of, oh, this doesn't sound like it's going

01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.540
to do as well as your last thing.

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.660
That's not the point.

01:30:45.660 --> 01:30:55.180
The point is on this quest for greatness, are you living up to your ability?

01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:58.700
By the way, is there something interesting to say about your worldview, because you mentioned

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:09.820
psychic and sort of the ways we can be healthy, the ways we can grow and how much maybe medicine

01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:15.340
or science has the answers?

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:18.020
Is there some interesting way to describe that worldview?

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:22.900
I would just say I'm open-minded, I believe anything's possible.

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:28.100
And if I was going to trust in any practical information, it would be something thousands

01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.540
of years old.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:32.380
There's wisdom in that history.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:33.380
Yeah.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.620
Well, it's more tested.

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:42.700
It's not always right, but at least it's been somewhat tested.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.020
Science is also tested.

01:31:45.020 --> 01:31:48.940
The thing I'm a little bit skeptical of sometimes is just the hubris that often comes with the

01:31:48.940 --> 01:31:54.940
modern, with the latest, the newest, this feeling like you figured it all out.

01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:58.140
Everything that's been done in the past has no wisdom.

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.620
And we basically solved every problem.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:02.620
There's nothing else to be solved.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:07.260
I mean, that's the defining characteristic of any age is like we've solved all the problems

01:32:07.260 --> 01:32:13.060
there are, we have the final answers, and our parents are all stupid.

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.060
That kind of energy.

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:18.220
You have to be extremely, extremely careful with that when it talks about, when you think

01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:22.820
about something as complex as the human body or the human mind, you have to be very, very,

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.820
very careful.

01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:26.020
I believe we know close to nothing.

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:27.220
Yeah, exactly.

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.780
Close to nothing.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:30.420
About anything.

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:31.420
About anything.

01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.420
About anything.

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:35.780
That place of humility is a good place to start to figure it all out.

01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:38.500
And in the end, we'll still know almost nothing.

01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:39.500
Yeah.

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.500
I don't think we need to know.

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.540
It's like we need to see what works.

01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:44.740
So we need to see what works for us.

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:46.460
It's interesting to know.

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:53.420
I know on the art side, knowing how it works isn't what makes it work.

01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:55.820
The magic of it isn't how it works.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:58.060
The magic is the magic.

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:06.740
And the magic happens in a way that's intuitive and accidental at times or incidental where

01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:12.500
you're trying many things and all of a sudden something works and you don't know why.

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.340
It's okay not to know why.

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:15.340
It doesn't matter.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:19.660
It doesn't really matter why as long as it does the thing that you want it to do, whatever

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.660
that is.

01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:21.660
Yeah.

01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.660
That's so weird.

01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.700
When you know the components, you still, yeah, the magic.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:27.700
What's the magic?

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.700
Where is the magic?

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:31.700
We know the components for stuff I care about, artificial intelligence.

01:33:31.700 --> 01:33:37.740
We know the components of a powerful computing machinery, but where does consciousness come

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:38.740
from?

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:41.660
What is that?

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:47.420
Where does the brilliant moments of insight come from?

01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:48.420
What's that?

01:33:48.420 --> 01:33:55.040
When even in simple games of chess or in simple, where do those breakthrough ideas of taking

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.300
the big risk that doesn't make any sense and then all of a sudden it becomes something

01:33:58.300 --> 01:33:59.300
beautiful?

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:00.300
Yeah.

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:01.300
We don't need to understand why.

01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:02.300
It just happens.

01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:03.300
It just happens.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:07.700
And often the things that end up breaking through don't break through in the way we

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:12.860
thought or turn out to be a third iteration of something that we thought was an entirely

01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:15.260
different thing.

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:16.580
We don't know.

01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:23.860
I think if we embrace that not knowing, we'll have a healthier experience going through

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.860
life.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:30.660
You've made a lot, it's not just music, everything, rearranging the chairs, the furniture as well.

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:35.460
You've done, like I said, the documentary, I guess you would say with Paul McCartney,

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:43.460
and you've done a podcast yourself, a broken record podcast, and you've done conversation

01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:45.580
too.

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:50.220
What have you learned from that process about the art of conversation and also maybe what

01:34:50.220 --> 01:34:58.140
advice would you give to me about what to do with conversation?

01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.700
What is interesting to you about conversation?

01:35:00.700 --> 01:35:10.300
One of the things that I like is to not feel like there's any stakes or that it's actually

01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.500
almost that it's not happening.

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:19.100
The fact that when I came in, you were setting up cameras made it less good for me.

01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:22.140
I knew that that would impact the conversation in a negative way.

01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:29.380
The best version of it would be if we didn't see the cameras and we didn't see any technology

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.140
and we were just sitting at this table having a conversation.

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:37.620
Maybe even if we were mic'd beforehand, it would be okay if it was necessary.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:41.220
But then we were just sitting here having a conversation, no people in the room, nothing,

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.500
and feeling like we're just having a conversation.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:53.820
I feel like it would get closer to the relaxed feeling.

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.700
Same thing we do in the studios.

01:35:55.700 --> 01:36:00.580
We've heard of red light fever, when artists get nervous when they play a song great and

01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:04.580
then the tape starts rolling and they can't play it.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.420
We're all to some degree like that.

01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:12.780
When you were with Paul McCartney, were you cognizant of cameras?

01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.240
We had the room black.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:18.340
Everybody who was working there was dressed in black.

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:19.700
Everything was invisible.

01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:27.700
We were lit in a way where even though there were probably between 12 and 20 people working

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:34.340
in the room, within three minutes of starting the conversation, Paul and I were alone in

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.340
the room.

01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:36.340
That was the feeling.

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.700
On occasion, you'd hear a noise and it would be weird.

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:46.940
We also had nobody was allowed to wear shoes because we were trying to create this intimate

01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:47.940
space.

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:56.780
In the recording studio, when we're recording, if even one person is there, that's just watching

01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:04.500
and not working, I'm usually there and an engineer is there technically making it happen.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:09.500
If anyone else is in the room, it's different because then it goes from this moment where

01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:19.060
the person's doing a performance to the sense or where the person is feeling something internally

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:25.460
and we're capturing it to the other version is they're performing for someone.

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.340
It's so interesting to push back the alternatives here.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:36.020
One about the third person, not to make people self-conscious, but I find that I'm so torn

01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:42.380
on that because sometimes when that person, Evan is in the room here, he's been in the

01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:52.460
room before, he's a huge fan of yours by the way, so he'll nod, he'll get excited.

01:37:52.460 --> 01:38:00.700
You can see that nodding and for some reason for me, he's like, yeah, you get excited together.

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:04.460
That third person can be a really special.

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:10.460
Meeting an audience when it's a friend or somebody that has that love in them.

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:12.980
It depends on the performer.

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:17.500
Some people really thrive in front of an audience.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:20.020
You're saying you like that simple intimacy of everything dissipates.

01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:24.180
Well, I like the reality of it not being, I want it to be as far from a performance

01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:25.180
as possible.

01:38:25.180 --> 01:38:26.180
Got it.

01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:32.340
If someone, I'll tell you a story, a story that just happened and it was viewed as kind

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:37.220
of a, it seemed uncool in the moment to the person that it happened to.

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:39.220
It wasn't at all.

01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:44.620
We were recording New Chili Peppers album, which is coming out I think any day now.

01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:49.180
I don't know what today's date is, but within the next, maybe by the time this airs, it

01:38:49.180 --> 01:38:52.740
will be out.

01:38:52.740 --> 01:39:01.340
The band was playing in the studio and it was ripping because they're incredible.

01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:08.100
One of the members walked through the control room after a particularly great performance

01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:14.100
and the engineer said, wow, that solo is really great.

01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:22.420
The person who heard this said, please don't say that and walked away.

01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:29.100
It just changed this feeling of we're in this place where we're doing this thing and there

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.180
is no outside world.

01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:33.160
We're doing this for us.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.900
We're going as deep as we can for us.

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:42.500
As soon as there's an acknowledgement to someone else, in a way, it breaks the concentration

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.780
of being inside of it.

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:53.780
That's so well told, but something about saying, wow, that solo is great, it reminds you that

01:39:53.780 --> 01:40:00.020
there's an outside world, but I feel like there's a way to enter the inside world as

01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:01.020
an audience.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:04.940
You just have to do that.

01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.540
It matters what you say.

01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:10.100
It matters how you look.

01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:16.700
There's these generic compliments, not generic, but they sound in the way an outside world

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:21.580
would interact as opposed to in that creative thing where you're dancing around the fire

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.580
together or something.

01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:26.500
I can tell you there's another interesting one that happened to me and I didn't know

01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:31.300
this until I saw the film of it, which was a strange one.

01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:38.780
We were recording with the Avett brothers and the song was called No Hard Feelings and

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.780
it was this recording of No Hard Feelings.

01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:22.740
Such a great voice.

01:41:52.740 --> 01:42:14.140
So bright, so hopeful, so light-hearted.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:29.020
And it's just hallelujah, and love involved, love in the words, love in the songs they

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:38.020
sing in the church, and no hard feelings.

01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:52.020
Lord knows they haven't done much good for anyone.

01:42:52.020 --> 01:43:05.020
Can't be afraid to cope with so much to have at home.

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:28.020
Does he sound as good as good, yeah?

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:33.020
Yes, every bit.

01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:19.020
Straight to the light, holding the love I've known in my life, and no hard feelings.

01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:31.020
Lord knows they haven't done much good for anyone.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:44.020
Can't be afraid to cope with so much to have at home.

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:56.020
Under the burning sky, I'm probably learning why

01:44:56.020 --> 01:45:09.020
It matters for me and you, to say it and mean it too

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:14.020
The life that is long remains

01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:16.020
It's just building and building and building

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:22.020
The life that is long remains

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:28.020
Good as it's been to me

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:35.020
I have no enemies

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:41.020
I have no enemies

01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:46.020
I have no enemies

01:45:46.020 --> 01:45:51.020
I have no enemies

01:46:11.020 --> 01:46:15.020
It's incredible, that's an incredible song. Is this a new record?

01:46:15.020 --> 01:46:19.020
This was, I don't know, four or five years ago, something like that.

01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:26.020
But what happened with this, that happened, and I mean, they're great, and it's always good.

01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:32.020
But that performance in that moment felt like the sky opened. It was unbelievable.

01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.020
But this was a single take?

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.020
This was a single take.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.020
Oh wow.

01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:37.020
That was just like...

01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:38.020
That was incredible, yeah, that was perfect.

01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:45.020
So when it ended, I said, great, what do you want to do next?

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:51.020
And they said, we just need a few minutes. They walked out.

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:56.020
And that's all I know. It's like, okay, I'm laying down, waiting until they're ready to start again.

01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:01.020
And in the film, there was a film made of the sessions of this.

01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:07.020
They went out and they're like, what was that? Like, didn't he get what just happened?

01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:18.020
Because it was so heavy, and it was just as heavy for me.

01:47:18.020 --> 01:47:24.020
And in the spirit of we're here to make the most great stuff we can, we're not going to open champagne.

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:28.020
It's like, great, what do you want to do next?

01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:34.020
It's like, let's not revel in this.

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:42.020
But they took it as like, this guy just doesn't even understand what we're doing.

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.020
But I had no idea until I saw the film.

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:45.020
That's funny.

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.020
Whoa, that was the reaction.

01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:50.020
Yeah, but I think your response is the right risk to take, right?

01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:54.020
Because it's the celebration at the end of a...

01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:57.020
You want to keep... People celebrate too early.

01:47:57.020 --> 01:48:02.020
Yes, great. And now let's use that momentum. We're in the zone.

01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:03.020
Yeah.

01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:04.020
What's next?

01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:08.020
Yeah. But you yourself in conversation.

01:48:08.020 --> 01:48:13.020
So you said that you want to create... Would you use the word intimacy?

01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:18.020
Like, is it to create... Or just the most real? Like, there's no cameras, there's no mics.

01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:21.020
I would say a place where you're comfortable to be naked.

01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:27.020
A place where you can be your most vulnerable without questioning it.

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:32.020
You want to really be able to let your guard down.

01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:37.020
And if you want to start crying when you're singing, whatever it is, whatever it is.

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.020
And it's hard to get to that place.

01:48:39.020 --> 01:48:42.020
And again, just the idea of someone like, hey, that was good.

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:47.020
That could take you right out of that going in.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:52.020
It's so interesting to think about how to achieve that and still have mics.

01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:53.020
Yeah.

01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:55.020
That...

01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:58.020
It's hard. It's harder. It's harder.

01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:02.020
Some of it is space. Some of it is raw conversational skill.

01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:08.020
Like, there's something about certain... Well, some of that is also just like...

01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:13.020
You have that, as I'm sure you were, there's a legend to Rick Rubin.

01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:18.020
And there's like my now friend Joe Rogan, there's a legend to him.

01:49:18.020 --> 01:49:24.020
And when you show up into Joe Rogan's studio, the legend creates an aura.

01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:31.020
And he, I think, subconsciously or consciously uses it to like, this is...

01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:34.020
Somehow it's nervous, nervous, nervous.

01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:38.020
And then you realize, oh, he's just human or something.

01:49:39.020 --> 01:49:43.020
There's a relief. And then, yeah, you could be yourself.

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.020
So that nervousness, nervousness, nervousness.

01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:52.020
And it's like, oh, it's not that this legend is just a human and it's normal.

01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:55.020
So I don't know how that's done.

01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:58.020
But it's so interesting to think about how that's...

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:03.020
Because I forget recording. I just enjoy it when it's real.

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:07.020
Like, this microphone gives us an excuse to connect on a human level

01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:09.020
and forget that nobody's listening. It doesn't matter.

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:12.020
I would say I felt maybe in the last 15 minutes,

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:16.020
I was less aware of anybody else being in the room or any equipment here.

01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:18.020
But it took that long.

01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.020
That's so interesting. I didn't have that at all.

01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:27.020
All I had, I mean, the wind calmed down outside, but there was a wind before.

01:50:27.020 --> 01:50:29.020
And there's something about the wind.

01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:33.020
Now, you can think of it from an audio engineering perspective.

01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:36.020
Like, oh, I wonder if the wind creates sound or whatever that you hear.

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:40.020
But I was thinking like, none of this matters.

01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:46.020
Like, the wind is like nature will be here before us, after us,

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:48.020
and all of this will be dead and forgotten.

01:50:48.020 --> 01:50:50.020
That's what the wind was reminding me of.

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:55.020
It's almost like laughing at the fact that we could even consider

01:50:55.020 --> 01:51:00.020
ourselves important enough to put on clothes and talk.

01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:03.020
But you love it. You love talking.

01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:07.020
You love the podcast and just that.

01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:10.020
Why did you dive into that?

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:13.020
It was a strange occurrence.

01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:16.020
My friend Malcolm said he wanted to start doing a podcast about music

01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:18.020
and asked if I would do it with him.

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:22.020
I like Malcolm, and I thought it would be more like his podcast,

01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:24.020
which is not an interview podcast.

01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:28.020
I thought it was going to be telling stories in the music world

01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:33.020
using audio stories.

01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.020
And then it just started being interviews.

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:38.020
Again, it wasn't intentional.

01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:41.020
It just started that way and ended up being that.

01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:43.020
But I love it.

01:51:43.020 --> 01:51:47.020
And I love both because I get to talk to people that I don't know,

01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:49.020
but also when I get to talk to people that I know

01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:52.020
and ask them about things that we would never talk about ever.

01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.020
You know, I don't know the origin stories of any of the people,

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:56.020
any of my friends.

01:51:56.020 --> 01:51:59.020
So to get to hear their perspective,

01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:01.020
another like relating to the Chili Peppers,

01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.020
because their album's coming out now,

01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:08.020
I interviewed all four members of the band individually.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:13.020
I interviewed John and Midway Through Anthony came in,

01:52:13.020 --> 01:52:15.020
and then I interviewed Flea separately,

01:52:15.020 --> 01:52:17.020
and I interviewed Chad separately.

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.020
And it was fascinating.

01:52:19.020 --> 01:52:20.020
I know them for 30 years.

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.020
And I learned a tremendous amount

01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.020
because you don't ask people about themselves

01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:30.020
when you're just, you know, workmates or friends.

01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:31.020
I do this sometimes.

01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.020
I'll just set up my microphones

01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:36.020
and I'll record a thing for private consumption

01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:38.020
with friends or loved ones.

01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:39.020
It's fascinating.

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:40.020
Good idea.

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:42.020
Because you get to ask those ridiculous questions.

01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:45.020
First of all, about life, about the future, about the past,

01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:48.020
about little fears and the things you miss.

01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.020
And yeah, there's something people just reveal.

01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:55.020
First loves, all those kinds of things.

01:52:55.020 --> 01:52:58.020
Your view on love, your view on,

01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:01.020
and those things don't come up in regular conversation.

01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:04.020
So it's so nice that there's something about.

01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:06.020
See, that's the pushback.

01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.020
There's something about this microphone,

01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:10.020
or maybe it's just the deliberate nature of sitting down

01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:11.020
and let's just talk.

01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:16.020
There is something about the microphone that, for me,

01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:18.020
thinks the same with the suit.

01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:20.020
I'm going to take this moment seriously.

01:53:20.020 --> 01:53:23.020
I've long forgotten that anyone is listening.

01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:28.020
I'm going to try to really listen to another human, first of all,

01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:35.020
and to also ask the questions that are really interesting.

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:38.020
I feel like when I talk to normal people out on the street,

01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:41.020
I'm not allowed to ask anything.

01:53:41.020 --> 01:53:44.020
I'm allowed to ask only the more generic things.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.020
I think you can ask anything.

01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:48.020
I'm starting to think that.

01:53:48.020 --> 01:53:51.020
I think you're allowed to ask anything.

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:54.020
I think you're allowed to basically do anything,

01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:56.020
especially in Texas.

01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.020
Yeah, I think it's okay to ask people,

01:53:57.020 --> 01:54:01.020
and I think people like it when you ask them.

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:06.020
People like to be seen and like to show who they are.

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:11.020
As the wind blows again, do you have advice for young people?

01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:16.020
You have a fascinating life journey.

01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:20.020
Is there advice you can give to people in high school and college

01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:27.020
about how to have a life like yours in whatever pursuit,

01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:32.020
in terms of success is such a silly word,

01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:40.020
but just find success or maybe happiness in career or just in life in general?

01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:46.020
The only advice I would have would be to not listen to anyone

01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:50.020
and to do what you love and to make things that you love,

01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.020
whatever it is.

01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:53.020
Make your favorite things.

01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:55.020
You be the audience.

01:54:55.020 --> 01:54:59.020
Make the thing for you the audience.

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:03.020
It doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks,

01:55:03.020 --> 01:55:05.020
and if you have to get a job to support yourself

01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:08.020
so that you can make your art, that's fine.

01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:12.020
You can't make art with someone else in mind.

01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:14.020
I don't believe it can be good.

01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.020
What does success feel like?

01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:19.020
Are you grateful?

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:22.020
Are you proud of the work you've done in the past?

01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:26.020
Or is there some engine of constant dissatisfaction,

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:29.020
like self-criticism of, I could have done better?

01:55:29.020 --> 01:55:33.020
No, I'm pleased with the work that we did,

01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:35.020
excited to keep working, it's fun.

01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:37.020
I don't know what else I would do with myself

01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:41.020
because I like making things, it's fun.

01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:44.020
I feel like it's my reason to be on the planet,

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.020
so I just keep doing it.

01:55:46.020 --> 01:55:50.020
Whatever ideas are actually coming from elsewhere

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:54.020
and are using your mind as a temporary vehicle,

01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:56.020
that's their purpose to be on this planet.

01:55:56.020 --> 01:56:02.020
Your purpose is to procreate and not die and eat regularly enough

01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:05.020
such that the brain is alive.

01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:07.020
It's a biological purpose.

01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.020
And anything I can do to keep the channel open

01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:12.020
to allow what wants to come through to come through,

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:15.020
I'm a willing channel.

01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:17.020
It's so interesting because I'm extremely self-critical,

01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:21.020
so you don't have that self-criticism, harsh,

01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:24.020
like this could have been better.

01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:29.020
If it could have been better, I would keep working on it.

01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:32.020
If it could be better, it's not done.

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:37.020
If the one is done, it's done.

01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:39.020
Well, it's the best it can be.

01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:43.020
I've done everything I can to make it the best it can be,

01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:47.020
and I can't do more than that, so there's nothing to be critical of.

01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:53.020
If you always give all of yourself and do your best,

01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:55.020
which you're capable of doing,

01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:59.020
I'm not suggesting that you're capable of doing more than you can do,

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:01.020
but whatever it is that you can do,

01:57:01.020 --> 01:57:04.020
if you've given all of yourself to it, you've done your best,

01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:07.020
where could there be regret?

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:08.020
Yeah.

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:11.020
There could be you re-listen to an album,

01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:14.020
you re-listen to anything you've created,

01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:17.020
and think, oh, there's so many interesting ideas missed.

01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:20.020
It's fine, though, but that was that moment.

01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:25.020
It's almost like a diary entry.

01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:30.020
Everything we make is a reflection of a moment in time, a window in time.

01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:33.020
It could be a day, it could be a year,

01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:38.020
it could be whatever window you decide that it is.

01:57:38.020 --> 01:57:41.020
But if you give it all of yourself,

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:46.020
and you know if you're not interested in working on it anymore, it's done.

01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:50.020
Now, you may decide it's not good enough to share with people, and that's fine,

01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:54.020
but if it's good enough to share with people, there's no regret looking back.

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:58.020
That's funny, because think of it as a diary entry.

01:57:58.020 --> 01:58:01.020
It's hard to look back at a diary entry and say, you know...

01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.020
I did it wrong.

01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:03.020
I did it wrong.

01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:05.020
It's impossible.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:10.020
Yeah, and even if it's read by a hundred people, a thousand people,

01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.020
a million people, it's just a diary entry.

01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:14.020
It doesn't matter.

01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:18.020
Speaking of doesn't matter, this life is finite.

01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:24.020
All of us, even Rikruba, will be forgotten one day.

01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.020
Do you think about your mortality?

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:26.020
Tomorrow.

01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:30.020
Tomorrow, yes.

01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.020
Do you think about the finiteness of this thing?

01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:36.020
Do you think about mortality, about your mortality?

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.020
Does it make any sense to you?

01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.020
Do you think about death?

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:41.020
Are you afraid of death?

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.020
I don't think about it.

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.020
I don't think about it very much.

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:47.020
Are you afraid?

01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:48.020
I don't think I'm afraid.

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:53.020
I mean, I don't want to die, but I know that that's in the cards,

01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:55.020
and when it happens, it happens.

01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:58.020
Your nature of not wanting to die is kind of like,

01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:01.020
you don't want to go to a shitty restaurant.

01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:02.020
You'd like to go to a nicer one.

01:59:02.020 --> 01:59:03.020
So it's just a preference thing.

01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:07.020
Well, I want to keep living because I want to do what I like to do.

01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:10.020
So now who knows?

01:59:10.020 --> 01:59:13.020
Whatever comes next, maybe even better.

01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:15.020
Maybe we're, I don't know.

01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:19.020
I haven't experienced it yet, so who knows?

01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:22.020
What do you think happens after we die?

01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:25.020
I believe we go on in some capacity.

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:29.020
I don't know what that means, but in the same way that everything recycles,

01:59:29.020 --> 01:59:35.020
everything comes around, I don't know why we would be different.

01:59:35.020 --> 01:59:36.020
In some way.

01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:37.020
In some way.

01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:41.020
I don't know what that way is, and I don't know that it's in the same being

01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:45.020
or in the same grouping of information, whatever that is.

01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:51.020
But the thing that makes us us, that information, I imagine, goes on.

01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:56.020
Yes, it does seem like our world here, at least on Earth, has a memory,

01:59:56.020 --> 01:59:59.020
and just like history, it kind of rhymes.

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:03.020
It brings back creations of the past,

02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:06.020
and rifts on them, improvises on top of them.

02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:09.020
And in that way, humanity propagates.

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:11.020
I mean, you see it with garbage.

02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:14.020
You see the mountains of garbage.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:16.020
It doesn't really go anywhere.

02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:20.020
Even when it breaks up, it disintegrates, but it's never really gone.

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:22.020
Same.

02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.020
Is there anything in this world you're afraid of?

02:00:25.020 --> 02:00:27.020
A lot of things.

02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:29.020
But not death.

02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:31.020
Why?

02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:33.020
I don't know. I don't know.

02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:35.020
What are you afraid of?

02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:37.020
Death is more of a question mark.

02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.020
Again, I'm not in any...

02:00:39.020 --> 02:00:40.020
To be answered.

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.020
Yeah, I'm not in any hurry for that to happen.

02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:47.020
But it will happen, and when it does, we get to experience what that is.

02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:52.020
Okay, then the big question mark, what's the meaning of this whole thing?

02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:54.020
What's the meaning of life?

02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.020
Macrubin.

02:00:56.020 --> 02:01:00.020
Putting my name on it makes it harder to answer.

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.020
It's just a diary entry, like we said.

02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.020
It's true.

02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:06.020
And you will get a different answer tomorrow.

02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:08.020
Let's see, what's the meaning of life today?

02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.020
And later today.

02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:18.020
So for people who don't know, we were maybe thinking of maybe meeting in Austin,

02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:24.020
have some barbecue, and now we're in the middle of nowhere in beautiful West Texas.

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:31.020
This is basically a glorified delivery of barbecue, of my favorite barbecue,

02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:36.020
maybe one of your top favorite barbecues, to one of my favorite humans.

02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:38.020
So we get to eat some barbecue today.

02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.020
Maybe that's the meaning.

02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:44.020
Do you have something bigger than barbecue?

02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:46.020
Barbecue is pretty big.

02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:50.020
Where does your love for barbecue come from, by the way?

02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:58.020
Well, I was a vegan for 20-something years, and once I found my way back into eating meat,

02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:04.020
I think barbecue is my favorite of any of the things that I didn't eat for so long.

02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:09.020
I have to ask you, I almost forgot.

02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:16.020
So there's an SNL skit with Will Ferrell that he wrote about Don't Fear the Reaper,

02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:19.020
where Bruce Dickinson is the producer.

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:21.020
I always think about you when I see that skit.

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:23.020
I don't know why people should definitely watch it.

02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:27.020
And he demands more cowbell into the mix.

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:31.020
And the whole band, this is how I imagine people interact with you.

02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.020
The whole band is really impressed.

02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:35.020
We get to work with the great Bruce Dickinson.

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:38.020
And then it's played by Christopher Walken, and he says,

02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:45.020
like, fellas, fellas, I put on my pants one leg at a time, just like the rest of you.

02:02:45.020 --> 02:02:49.020
But once my pants are on, I make gold records.

02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:55.020
And then the whole skit continues, and he wants to add more and more cowbell.

02:02:55.020 --> 02:02:59.020
And Will Ferrell said he wrote that skit because he always heard the song

02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.020
Don't Fear the Reaper, and there's a distant cowbell.

02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:03.020
It's very light in the mix.

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:08.020
And he's like, I wonder what the story of that cowbell is.

02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:13.020
Like, if we just look at that one layer, who's that guy that was in there?

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.020
So is that basically exactly how your life is?

02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.020
Is Bruce Dickinson from the cowbell?

02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:22.020
I don't know if you've seen that skit.

02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:25.020
I don't think it's like that.

02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:27.020
It's not? Okay. All right.

02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:29.020
I'm just going to pretend then.

02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:31.020
Rick, this is a huge honor that you sit with me.

02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:38.020
I mean, what can I say about how incredible of a human you are?

02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:40.020
You truly are out of this world.

02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:42.020
And thank you so much for talking today.

02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:43.020
I'm a great fan.

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:47.020
I'm so happy that you agreed to do this with me.

02:03:47.020 --> 02:03:50.020
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Rick Rubin.

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:54.020

02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:58.020
And now let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein.

02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:01.020
Imagination is everything.

02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:05.020
It is the preview of life's coming attractions.

02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:08.020
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:14.020
Thank you.
