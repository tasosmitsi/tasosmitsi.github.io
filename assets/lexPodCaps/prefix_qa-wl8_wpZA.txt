00:00.000 --> 00:10.300
What happened during World War II was that once the Germans started to run out of manpower,

00:10.300 --> 00:13.780
they created foreign legion groups.

00:13.780 --> 00:18.040
But because those people were not Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.

00:18.040 --> 00:24.140
So they were put under the command of Henry Himmler, under command of SS and became known

00:24.140 --> 00:29.340
as SS Waffen units.

00:29.340 --> 00:34.000
One of such units was created in Ukraine.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.460
The following is a conversation with Sergey Plohy, a historian at Harvard University and

00:39.460 --> 00:43.700
the director of the Ukrainian Research Institute, also at Harvard.

00:43.700 --> 00:50.380
As a historian, he specializes in the history of Eastern Europe, with an emphasis on Ukraine.

00:50.380 --> 00:56.120
He wrote a lot of great books on Ukraine and Russia, the Soviet Union, on Slavic peoples

00:56.120 --> 01:01.680
in general across centuries, on Chernobyl and nuclear disasters, and on the current

01:01.680 --> 01:09.120
war in Ukraine, a book titled The Russo-Ukrainian War, The Return of History.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.960
This is the Lex Freeman podcast.

01:10.960 --> 01:14.240
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.500
And now, dear friends, here's Sergey Plohy.

01:18.500 --> 01:22.380
What are the major explanations for the collapse of the Soviet Union?

01:22.380 --> 01:25.680
Maybe ones you agree with and ones you disagree with.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.000
Very often, people confuse three different processes that were taking place in the late

01:31.000 --> 01:33.520
80s and early 90s.

01:33.520 --> 01:38.640
And the one was the collapse of communism as ideology.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.400
Another was the end of the Cold War.

01:41.400 --> 01:47.080
And the third one was the end of the Soviet Union.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.080
All of these processes were interrelated, interconnected.

01:51.080 --> 01:59.480
But when people provide ideology as the explanation for all of these processes, that's why I disagree.

01:59.480 --> 02:05.400
Because ideological collapse happened on the territory of the Soviet Union in general.

02:05.400 --> 02:11.400
Soviet Union lost the Cold War, whether we are talking about Moscow, Leningrad, or Saint

02:11.400 --> 02:14.800
Petersburg now, or Vladivostok.

02:14.800 --> 02:21.220
But the fall of the Soviet Union is about a story in which Vladivostok and Saint Petersburg

02:21.220 --> 02:27.920
ended up in one country, and Kiev, Minsk, and Dushanbe ended in different countries.

02:27.920 --> 02:34.400
So the theories and explanations about how did that happen, for me, these are really

02:34.400 --> 02:38.840
very helpful theories for understanding the Soviet collapse.

02:38.840 --> 02:47.600
So the mobilization from below, the collapse of the center against the background of economic

02:47.600 --> 02:54.920
collapse, against the background of ideological implosion.

02:54.920 --> 03:01.700
That's how I look at the fall of the Soviet Union, and that's how I look at the theories

03:01.700 --> 03:03.440
that explain that collapse.

03:03.480 --> 03:10.480
So it's a story of geography, ideology, economics, which are the most important to understand

03:10.480 --> 03:14.640
of what made the collapse of the Soviet Union happen?

03:14.640 --> 03:21.540
The Soviet collapse was unique, but not more unique than the collapse of any other empire.

03:21.540 --> 03:28.360
So what we really witnessed, or the world witnessed back in 1991, and we continue to

03:28.360 --> 03:33.960
witness today with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, is a collapse of one of the

03:33.960 --> 03:36.840
largest world empires.

03:36.840 --> 03:44.360
We talked about the Soviet Union and now talk about Russia as possessing plus minus one-sixth

03:44.360 --> 03:46.840
of the surface of the earth.

03:46.840 --> 03:53.200
You don't get in possession of one-sixth of the earth by being a nation state.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.160
You get that sort of size as an empire.

03:57.560 --> 04:02.600
The Soviet collapse is a continuation of the disintegration of the Russian empire that

04:02.600 --> 04:10.320
started back in 1917, that was arrested for some period of time by the Bolsheviks, by

04:10.320 --> 04:17.240
the communist ideology, which was internationalist ideology, and then came back in full force

04:17.240 --> 04:19.440
in the late 80s and early 90s.

04:19.440 --> 04:24.920
So the most important story for me, this is the story of the continuing collapse of the

04:24.920 --> 04:32.560
Russian empire and the rise of not just local nationalism, but also rise of Russian nationalism

04:32.560 --> 04:40.600
that turned out to be as a destructive force for the imperial or multi-ethnic multinational

04:40.600 --> 04:48.840
state, as was Ukrainian nationalism or Georgian or Estonian for that matter.

04:48.840 --> 04:54.160
Or you said a lot of interesting stuff there, 1917 Bolsheviks, internationalists, how that

04:54.200 --> 04:56.680
plays with the idea of Russian empire and so on.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.480
But first, let me ask about U.S. influence on this.

04:59.480 --> 05:06.080
So one of the ideas is that, you know, through the Cold War, that mechanism, the U.S.

05:06.080 --> 05:12.440
had made your interest to weaken the Soviet Union and therefore the collapse could be

05:12.440 --> 05:16.680
attributed to pressure and manipulation from the United States.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.400
Is there truth to that?

05:18.720 --> 05:22.440
The pressure from the United States, this is part of the Cold War.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.680
And Cold War, part of that story, but it doesn't explain the Soviet collapse.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.280
And the reason is quite simple.

05:32.800 --> 05:39.720
The United States of America didn't want the Soviet Union to collapse and disintegrate.

05:40.320 --> 05:45.880
They didn't want that at the start of the Cold War in 1948, we now have the strategic

05:45.880 --> 05:49.920
documents, they were concerned about that, they didn't want to do that.

05:49.960 --> 05:53.880
And certainly they didn't want to do that in the year 1990-91.

05:54.680 --> 06:04.000
As late as August of 1991, the month of the coup in Moscow, President Bush, Judge H.W.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.400
Bush, travels from Moscow to Kiev and gives famous or infamous speech called Chicken Kiev

06:10.400 --> 06:15.960
speech, basically warning Ukrainians against going for independence.

06:16.680 --> 06:21.960
The Soviet collapse was a huge headache for the administration in the White House for

06:21.960 --> 06:23.000
a number of reasons.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.600
They liked to work with Gorbachev.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.960
The Soviet Union was emerging as a junior partner of the United States in the international

06:30.960 --> 06:34.880
arena. Collapse was destroying all of that.

06:35.520 --> 06:41.240
And on the top of that, there was a question of the nuclear weapons, unaccounted nuclear

06:41.240 --> 06:41.760
weapons.

06:42.280 --> 06:48.520
So the United States was doing everything humanly possible to keep the Soviet Union

06:48.960 --> 06:57.680
together in one piece until really late November of 1991 when it became clear that it was a

06:57.680 --> 07:04.920
loss cause and they had to say goodbye to Gorbachev and to the project that he introduced.

07:05.880 --> 07:12.440
A few months later or a year later, there was a presidential campaign and Bush was running

07:12.440 --> 07:15.440
for the second term and was looking for achievements.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.960
And there were many achievements.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.240
I basically treat him with great respect.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.600
But destruction of the Soviet Union was not one of those achievements.

07:26.640 --> 07:30.280
He was on the other side of that divide.

07:30.320 --> 07:35.960
But the politics, the political campaign, of course, have their own rules and they

07:35.960 --> 07:43.000
produce and give birth to mythology, which we still at least in this country, we live

07:43.000 --> 07:44.080
till now, till today.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.360
So Gorbachev is an interesting figure in all of this.

07:47.760 --> 07:53.680
Is there a possible history where the Soviet Union did not collapse and some of the ideas

07:53.680 --> 07:56.680
that Gorbachev had for the future of the Soviet Union came to life?

07:57.680 --> 08:03.400
Of course, history, on the one hand, there is a statement it doesn't allow for what

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
ifs.

08:04.400 --> 08:09.200
On the other hand, in my opinion, history is full of what ifs.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.000
That's what history is about.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
And certainly, certainly there are scenarios how the Soviet Union would continue, would

08:18.000 --> 08:21.640
continue beyond, let's say, Gorbachev's tenure.

08:21.640 --> 08:28.800
And the argument has been made that the reforms that he introduced, that they were mismanaged

08:28.800 --> 08:32.800
and they could be managed differently, or there could be no reforms and there could

08:32.800 --> 08:34.120
be continuing stagnation.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.560
So that is all possible.

08:36.640 --> 08:42.640
What I think would happen one way or another is the Soviet collapse in a different form

08:42.640 --> 08:51.240
on somebody else's watch at some later period in time, because we're dealing with not just

08:51.320 --> 08:56.320
processes that were happening in the Soviet Union, we are dealing with global processes.

08:56.320 --> 09:03.080
And the 20th century turned out to be the century of the disintegration of the empires.

09:03.640 --> 09:10.680
You look at the globe, at the map of the world in 1914, and you compare it to the map at

09:10.680 --> 09:17.720
the end of the 20th century, in 1991, 1992, and suddenly you realize that there are many

09:17.720 --> 09:23.240
candidates for being the most important event, the most important process in the 20th century.

09:23.960 --> 09:31.000
But the biggest global thing that happened was redrawing the map of the world and producing

09:32.600 --> 09:35.720
dozens, if not hundreds, of new states.

09:35.720 --> 09:40.200
That's the outcome of the different processes of the 20th century.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.200
Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time.

09:44.200 --> 09:50.280
Czechoslovakia goes through what can be called a civilized divorce, a very,

09:50.280 --> 09:55.000
very rare occurrence in the fall of multinational states.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.880
So yeah, the writing was on the wall, whether it would happen under Gorbachev or later,

09:59.880 --> 10:05.960
whether it would happen as the result of reforms or as the result of no reforms.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.400
But I think that sooner or later that would happen.

10:11.400 --> 10:16.200
Yeah, it's very possible hundreds of years from now the way the 20th century is written about

10:17.480 --> 10:22.040
as the century defined by the collapse of empires.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.320
You call the Soviet Union the last empire.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.080
The book is called The Last Empire.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.120
So is there something fundamental about the way the world is

10:31.000 --> 10:34.120
that means it's not conducive to the formation of empires?

10:35.000 --> 10:40.040
The meaning that I was putting in the term of the Soviet Union as the last empire was

10:40.040 --> 10:49.880
that the Soviet collapse was the collapse of the last major European empires, traditional empires.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.760
That was in the 18th century, 19th century, and through most of the 20th century.

10:56.040 --> 11:01.480
The Austria-Hungary died in the midst of World War I.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.360
The Ottoman Empire disintegrated.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.240
The Brits were gone and left India.

11:07.640 --> 11:14.280
And there was the successor to the Russian Empire called the Soviet Union was still hanging on there.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.480
And then came 1991.

11:17.480 --> 11:25.640
And what we see even with today's Russia, it's a very different sort of policies.

11:26.360 --> 11:33.080
The Russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from 1991.

11:33.080 --> 11:39.960
So there is no national republics in the Russian Federation that would have more rights than

11:41.240 --> 11:43.480
the Russian administrative units.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.680
So the structure is different.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.960
The nationality policies are different.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.920
The level of Russification is much higher.

11:52.920 --> 11:58.920
So it is in many ways already a post-imperial formation.

11:59.400 --> 12:06.360
And you write about that moment, 1991, the role that Ukraine played in that

12:06.360 --> 12:08.440
seems to be a very critical role.

12:08.440 --> 12:15.000
Can you describe just that, what role Ukraine played in the collapse of the Soviet Union?

12:15.000 --> 12:22.200
History is many things, but it started in a very simple way of making notes about,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.880
on the yearly basis, what happened this year with that.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.240
So it's about chronology.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.800
Chronology in the history of the collapse of the Soviet Union is very important.

12:31.800 --> 12:35.640
You have Ukrainian referendum on December 1, 1991.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.840
And you have dissolution of the Soviet Union by the

12:38.840 --> 12:41.640
leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus one week later.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.360
And the question is why?

12:46.600 --> 12:49.320
Ukrainian referendum is the answer.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.360
But Ukrainians didn't answer their referendum question

12:54.360 --> 12:57.080
of whether they want the Soviet Union to be dissolved or not.

12:57.640 --> 13:04.600
They answered very limited in terms of, it's been in question whether you support

13:04.600 --> 13:10.360
the decision of your parliament for Ukraine to go independent.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.320
And the rest was not on the ballot.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.880
So why then, one week later, the Soviet Union is gone?

13:18.680 --> 13:27.000
And President Yeltsin explained to President Bush around that time the reason why Ukraine was so

13:27.000 --> 13:32.680
important. He said that, well, if Ukraine is gone, Russia is not interested in this

13:32.680 --> 13:38.760
Soviet project because Russia would be outnumbered and outvoted by the Muslim republics.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.640
So there was a cultural element. But there was also another one.

13:43.640 --> 13:49.480
Ukraine happened to be the second largest Soviet republic and then post-Soviet state

13:50.040 --> 13:54.760
in terms of population, in terms of the economy, economic potential and so on and so forth.

13:54.760 --> 14:01.080
And as Yeltsin suggested, closed culturally, linguistically and otherwise to Russia.

14:01.080 --> 14:08.120
So with the second largest republic gone, Russia didn't think that it was in Russia's interest to

14:08.120 --> 14:15.240
continue with the Soviet Union. And around that time, Yegor Gaidar, who was the chief economic

14:15.240 --> 14:22.280
advisor of Yeltsin, was telling him, well, we just don't have money anymore to support other

14:22.280 --> 14:30.120
republics. We have to focus on Russia. We have to use oil and gas money within the Russian federation.

14:30.840 --> 14:39.000
So the state was bankrupt. Imperial projects, at least in the context of the late 20th century,

14:39.000 --> 14:45.800
they costed money. It wasn't a money-making machine as it was back in the 18th or 19th century.

14:46.520 --> 14:54.040
And the combination of all these factors led to the processes in which Ukraine's decision

14:54.840 --> 15:02.280
to go independent spelled the end to the Soviet Union. And if today anybody

15:02.920 --> 15:08.920
wants to restore not the Soviet Union, but some form of Russian control over the post-Soviet space,

15:08.920 --> 15:13.480
Ukraine is as important today as it was back in December of 1991.

15:14.200 --> 15:22.600
Let me ask you about Vladimir Putin's statement that the collapse of the Soviet Union is one

15:22.600 --> 15:29.080
of the great tragedies of history. To what degree does he have a point? To what degree is he wrong?

15:29.800 --> 15:35.720
His formulation was that this is the greatest geopolitical catastrophe or tragedy of the

15:35.720 --> 15:44.360
20th century. And I specifically went and looked at the text and put it in specific time when it

15:44.360 --> 15:51.640
was happening. And it was interesting that the statement was made a few weeks before the May 9

15:52.360 --> 16:02.760
parade and celebrations of the victory, a key part of the mythology of the current Russian state.

16:02.760 --> 16:10.920
So why say things about the Soviet collapse being the largest geopolitical strategy and not

16:10.920 --> 16:19.000
in that particular context, the Second World War? My explanation at least is that the World War II,

16:19.000 --> 16:25.400
the price was enormous, but the Soviet Union emerged as a great victor and captured half of

16:26.040 --> 16:37.400
Europe. 1991, in terms of the lives lost at that point, the price was actually very low.

16:38.280 --> 16:45.400
But for Putin, what was important that the state was lost, and he in particular was concerned

16:45.400 --> 16:51.320
about the division of the Russian people, which he understood back then like he understands now

16:51.320 --> 17:00.680
in very, very broad terms. So for him, the biggest tragedy is not the loss of life. The biggest

17:00.680 --> 17:07.240
tragedy is the loss of the great power status or the unity of those whom he considered to be

17:07.800 --> 17:13.640
Russian nation. So at least this is my reading, this is my understanding of what is there,

17:13.640 --> 17:16.760
what is on the paper and what is between the lines.

17:17.240 --> 17:25.320
So both the unity of the sort of quote Russian Empire and the status of the super power.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.280
That's how I read it. You wrote a book,

17:28.840 --> 17:35.960
The Origins of the Slavic Nations. So let's go back into history. What is the origin of Slavic nations?

17:36.840 --> 17:44.600
We can look at that from different perspectives. And we are now making major breakthroughs in

17:44.600 --> 17:51.640
answering this question with the very interesting innovative linguistic analysis, the study of DNA.

17:52.280 --> 18:00.360
So that's really the new frontier. We are getting into a pre-historical period where there is no

18:00.360 --> 18:07.080
historical sources. And from what we can understand today, and that can of course change tomorrow

18:07.080 --> 18:16.360
with all these breakthroughs in sciences, is that the Slavs came into existence somewhere

18:16.360 --> 18:25.960
in the area of Pripyat Marshes, northwestern part of Ukraine, southwestern part of Belarus,

18:25.960 --> 18:32.520
eastern part of Poland. And that is considered to be a historical homeland of Slavs. And then

18:32.520 --> 18:38.840
they spread. And they spread all the way to the Adriatic. So we have Croats. We have Russians

18:38.840 --> 18:45.400
spreading all the way to the Pacific. We have Ukrainians. We have Belarusians, Poles. Once

18:45.400 --> 18:52.680
we had Czechoslovaks. Now we have Czechs and Slovaks. So that's the story of starting with

18:52.680 --> 18:57.880
the eighth and ninth century. Even a little bit earlier, we can already follow that story with the

18:57.880 --> 19:07.000
help of the written sources, mostly from Byzantine, then later from Western Europe.

19:07.000 --> 19:14.040
But what I was trying to do, not being a scientist, not being an expert in linguistics,

19:14.040 --> 19:22.520
or not being an expert in DNA analysis, I was trying to see what was happening in the minds

19:22.520 --> 19:30.280
of those peoples and their elites in particular, whom we call today not Slavs, but Eastern Slavs,

19:30.280 --> 19:34.440
which means Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. How they imagine themselves,

19:34.440 --> 19:41.000
how they imagine their world. And eventually, I look at the so-called nation-building projects.

19:41.560 --> 19:48.200
So trying to answer the question of how we arrived to the situation in which we are today,

19:48.200 --> 19:53.800
where there are not just three East Slavic nations, but there are also three East Slavic states,

19:54.840 --> 20:01.320
Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian. So this is the focus of my book. I end, admittedly,

20:01.320 --> 20:07.960
in that particular book, I end on the 18th century, before the era of nationalism. But then there are

20:07.960 --> 20:14.040
other books like Lost Kingdom, where I bring the story all the way up to today.

20:14.680 --> 20:23.720
So what aspects of the 8th and 9th century, the East Slavic states permeates to today

20:23.720 --> 20:27.880
that we should understand? Well, the most important one is that

20:28.600 --> 20:36.760
the existence of the state of Kievan Rus, back during the medieval period, created the foundations

20:37.400 --> 20:43.480
for historical mythology, common historical mythology, and there are just wars and battles

20:43.480 --> 20:51.400
over who has the right or more right for Kievan Rus. The legal code that was created at that time

20:51.400 --> 20:57.320
existed for a long period of time. The acceptance of Christianity from Byzantium,

20:57.880 --> 21:04.120
that became a big issue that separated then Eastern Slavs from their Western neighbors,

21:04.120 --> 21:14.120
including Czechs and Poles, but united in that way to, let's say, Bulgarians or Serbs,

21:14.120 --> 21:22.280
and the beginning of the written literature, beginning in Kiev. So all of that is considered

21:22.280 --> 21:31.080
to be part of heritage. All of that is being contested. And these debates that were academic

21:31.080 --> 21:38.760
for a long period of time, what we see now tragically are being continued on the battlefield.

21:38.760 --> 21:42.680
What is Kiev? What is Rus that you mentioned? What's the importance of these?

21:44.360 --> 21:53.080
You mentioned them as the defining places and terms, labels at the beginning of all this. So

21:53.080 --> 22:03.720
what is Kiev? Kiev became a capital or the outpost of the Vikings who were trying to

22:03.720 --> 22:15.240
establish control over the trade route between what is today's Western Russia and Belarus and

22:15.240 --> 22:21.800
Northern Ukraine, so the forest areas, and the biggest and the richest market in the world that

22:21.800 --> 22:29.320
existed at that time, which was in Constantinople in Byzantium. So the idea was to get whatever

22:29.320 --> 22:34.120
goods you can get in that part of Eastern Europe. And most of those goods were slaves,

22:35.240 --> 22:42.680
local population. Put them on the ships in Kiev because Kiev was on the border with the steppe

22:42.680 --> 22:50.360
zones. Steppe zones were controlled by other groups, Scythians, Sarmatians,

22:51.080 --> 23:01.400
Polovtsians, Pechenegs, and so on. You name it. And then staying on the river, being protected

23:01.400 --> 23:07.480
from attacks of the nomads to come to the Black Sea and sell these products in Constantinople.

23:08.200 --> 23:15.240
That was the idea. That was the model. Vikings tried to practice that sort of

23:17.000 --> 23:22.360
business model also in other parts of Europe. And like in other parts of Europe,

23:22.360 --> 23:28.120
they turned out to be by default, creators of new polities, of new states.

23:28.920 --> 23:37.160
And that was the story of the first Kievan dynasty. And Kiev as the capital of that huge

23:37.160 --> 23:44.120
empire that was going from the Baltics to today's central Ukraine and then was trying to get through

23:44.120 --> 23:54.120
the southern Ukraine to the Black Sea. That was a major, major European state kingdom, if you want

23:54.120 --> 24:03.400
to call it, of medieval Europe, creating a lot of tradition in terms of dynasty, in terms of language,

24:03.400 --> 24:09.880
in terms of religion, in terms of, again, historical mythology. So Kiev is central

24:09.880 --> 24:18.920
for the nation-building myth of a number of groups in the region.

24:20.520 --> 24:27.160
So in one perspective and narrative, Kiev is at the center of this Russian empire.

24:28.120 --> 24:35.160
At which point does Moscow come to prominence as the center of the Russian empire?

24:35.880 --> 24:40.200
Well, the Russian empire is a term and really creation of the 18th century.

24:42.120 --> 24:48.360
What we have for the Kievan, we call it Kievan Rus', again, this is a term of the 19th century.

24:48.360 --> 24:54.440
They call themselves Rus'. And there was metropolitan of Rus', and there was Rus'

24:54.520 --> 25:01.240
principalities. So very important to keep in mind that Rus' is not Russia because that was

25:01.240 --> 25:10.920
a self-name for all multiple groups on that territory. And Moscow doesn't exist at the time

25:10.920 --> 25:19.960
when Kiev emerges as the capital. The first reference to Moscow comes from the 12th century

25:19.960 --> 25:28.760
when it was founded by one of the Kievan princes. And Moscow comes to prominence really in a very

25:28.760 --> 25:33.320
different context and with a very different empire running the show in the region.

25:33.960 --> 25:42.600
The story of Moscow and the rise of Moscow, this is the story of the Mongol rule over former Rus'

25:42.600 --> 25:52.680
lands and former Rus' territories. The part of the former Rus' eventually overthrows the Mongol

25:52.680 --> 26:04.360
control with the help of the small group of people called Lithuanians, which had a young state and

26:04.360 --> 26:10.760
young dynasty and united this lands, which were mostly in today's terms, Ukrainian and Belarusian.

26:10.760 --> 26:17.320
So they separate early. And what is today's Russia, mostly Western Russia, Central Russia,

26:17.320 --> 26:25.640
stays under the Mongol control up until late 15th century. And that was the story when Moscow

26:25.640 --> 26:35.400
rises as the new capital of that realm, replacing the city of Vladimir as that capital. For those

26:35.400 --> 26:43.240
who ever went to Russia, they're familiar with, of course, Vladimir as the place of the

26:44.360 --> 26:51.320
oldest architectural monuments, the so-called the Golden Ring of Russia and so on and so forth.

26:51.320 --> 26:56.680
So Vladimir is central and there are so many architectural monuments there because before

26:56.680 --> 27:03.720
there was Moscow, there was Vladimir eventually in this struggle over control of the territory,

27:03.720 --> 27:12.600
struggle for favors from the Mongols and the Tatar horde. Moscow emerges as the center of that

27:12.600 --> 27:21.080
particular realm under Mongols. After the Mongol rule is removed, Moscow embarks on the project

27:21.080 --> 27:26.360
that historians, Russian historians of the 19th century called the gathering of the Russian lands.

27:26.840 --> 27:39.000
Using Russian now for Russia and trying to bring back the lands of former Kievan Rus,

27:39.000 --> 27:47.720
but also the lands of the former Mongol Empire. The Russians get to the Pacific before they get

27:47.720 --> 28:02.680
to Kiev historically and really the gathering of the Russian lands ends only in 1945 when

28:03.480 --> 28:10.120
the Soviet Union bullies the Czechoslovak government into turning what is today's

28:10.680 --> 28:16.040
Transcarpathian Ukraine to the Soviet Union. It is included in the Ukrainian-Soviet Socialist

28:16.040 --> 28:23.880
Republic. So that's the moment when that destiny the way how it was imagined by the

28:23.880 --> 28:29.320
19th century Russian historian was eventually fulfilled. Moscow was in control of all these

28:29.320 --> 28:35.800
lands. So to what degree are the Slavic people one people? This is the theme that will continue

28:35.800 --> 28:40.920
throughout I think versus a collection of multiple peoples, whether we're talking about the

28:41.880 --> 28:48.120
Kievan Rus or we're talking about the 19th century Russian Empire conception.

28:49.480 --> 28:54.680
Well, a number of ways to look at that. One, the most obvious, the most clear is language.

28:56.360 --> 29:04.440
And there is no question that Poles speak a separate language and their Slavs.

29:04.760 --> 29:14.200
And there is no question for anyone going to Ukraine and hearing Ukrainian realizing

29:14.200 --> 29:19.640
that this is not Russian. The level of comprehension can be different. You can understand

29:19.640 --> 29:26.440
certain words and you don't understand others and the same would be with Polish and the same would

29:26.440 --> 29:35.720
be with Czech. So there is this linguistic history that is in common but languages very clearly

29:35.720 --> 29:45.400
indicate that you're dealing with different peoples. We know that language is not everything.

29:45.400 --> 29:53.160
Americans speak a particular way of English. Australians speak a particular variant of English

29:54.120 --> 30:01.400
but for reasons of geography, history, we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity,

30:01.400 --> 30:07.880
these are different nations and different peoples. And there are some parts of political

30:07.880 --> 30:15.560
tradition are in common, others are quite different. So the same when it comes to language,

30:15.560 --> 30:20.280
the same when it comes to political tradition, to the loyalty to the political institution applies

30:20.280 --> 30:29.960
to Slavic nations. So again, there is nothing particular unique about the Slavs in that regard.

30:30.600 --> 30:37.720
You wrote the book, The Cossack Myth, History and Nationhood in the Age of Empires. It tells the

30:37.720 --> 30:42.920
story of an anonymous manuscript called The History of the Rus. It started being circulated

30:42.920 --> 30:49.160
in the 1820s. I would love it if you can tell the story of this. This is supposedly one of the most

30:49.160 --> 30:54.760
impactful texts in modern history. So what's the importance of this text? What did it contain? How

30:54.760 --> 30:59.480
did it define the future of the region? In the first decades of the 19th century,

30:59.480 --> 31:07.080
after Napoleonic Wars, a mysterious text emerged that was attributed to an Orthodox archbishop

31:07.080 --> 31:18.200
that was long dead, which was claiming that the Cossacks of Ukraine were in fact the

31:19.080 --> 31:27.880
original Rus people and that they had the right for a particular place, for central place

31:28.920 --> 31:36.680
in the Russian Empire. And it tells the history of the Cossacks. It's the era of romanticism,

31:36.680 --> 31:43.480
full of all sorts of drama. There are heroes, there are villains. And the text captivates

31:43.480 --> 31:50.440
the attention of some key figures in the Russian intellectual elite in St. Petersburg.

31:53.480 --> 32:02.680
People like Kondrati Yaryleyev, who was executed for his participation in 1825 uprising,

32:03.400 --> 32:10.120
writes poetry on the basis of this text. Pushkin pays attention to it as well.

32:10.760 --> 32:19.720
And then comes along the key figure in Ukrainian national revival of the 19th century,

32:20.520 --> 32:27.320
Ukrainian national project, Taras Shevchenko, and reads it as well. And they all read it very

32:27.320 --> 32:37.640
differently. Eventually, by the beginning of the mid 20th century, some of the Russian

32:39.320 --> 32:45.800
mostly nationalist writers call this text the Koran of Ukrainian nationalism.

32:47.080 --> 32:54.840
So what is there? The story, it's very important in a sense that what the authors, and that's what

32:54.840 --> 33:02.760
I claim in the book, what the authors of the text were trying to say, they were trying to say that

33:02.760 --> 33:11.480
the Cossack elite should have the same rights as the Russian nobility and brings the long

33:11.480 --> 33:16.600
historical records to prove how cool the Cossacks were over the period of time.

33:17.720 --> 33:24.280
But at the beginning of the 19th century, they put this claim already, they use new arguments.

33:24.280 --> 33:28.680
And these arguments are about nation and nationalism. And they're saying that the

33:28.680 --> 33:40.040
Cossacks are a separate nation. And that's a big, big, big claim. The Russian Empire,

33:40.040 --> 33:45.720
and this is a very, very good argument in historiography, that Russian Empire grew and

33:45.720 --> 33:53.240
acquired this one sixth of the earth by using one very specific way of integrating those lands.

33:53.240 --> 33:59.160
It integrated elites. It was making deals with the elites, whether the elites were Muslim,

33:59.160 --> 34:02.680
or the elites were Roman Catholic, as the case was the Poles.

34:03.800 --> 34:08.760
Elites would be integrated, and the Empire was based on that estate,

34:11.400 --> 34:20.360
the estate loyalty and estate integration. But once you bring in the factor of nation and

34:20.360 --> 34:28.600
nationalism and language, then once in a sudden, the whole model of the integration of the elites

34:28.600 --> 34:35.240
irrespective of their language, religion, and culture starts falling apart. And the Poles were

34:35.240 --> 34:46.120
the first who really produced this sort of a challenge to the Russian Empire by two uprisings

34:46.120 --> 34:53.880
in the 19th century. And Ukrainians then followed in their footsteps. So the importance of the text

34:53.880 --> 35:01.800
is that it was making claim on the part of a particular estate, the Cossack officer class,

35:02.840 --> 35:08.840
which was that Empire could survive. But it turned it, given the conditions of the time,

35:08.920 --> 35:18.120
into the claim for the special role of Cossacks as a nation, creating that this is a separate

35:18.120 --> 35:25.800
nation, a Rus nation. And that is the challenge of nationalism that no Empire really survived,

35:25.800 --> 35:31.080
and the Russian Empire was not an exception. So there's a turning point when the discourse

35:31.080 --> 35:38.520
switches from loyalty based on the integration of the elites to the loyalty based on attachment

35:38.520 --> 35:42.120
to your nation, to your language, and to your culture, and to your history.

35:42.760 --> 35:50.280
So that was like the initial spark, the flame that led to nationalist movements.

35:50.280 --> 35:56.920
That was the beginning and the beginning that was building a bridge between the existence of the

35:56.920 --> 36:02.680
Cossack state in the 17th and 18th century that was used as a foundation for the Cossack mythology,

36:02.680 --> 36:09.880
Ukrainian national mythology, went into the Ukrainian national anthem and the new age and

36:09.880 --> 36:14.440
the new stage where the Cossacks were not there anymore, where there were professors, intellectuals,

36:14.440 --> 36:23.400
students, members of the national and organizations. And it started, of course, with romantic poetry.

36:23.400 --> 36:30.600
It was started with collecting folklore and then later goes to the political stage and eventually

36:30.600 --> 36:36.840
the stage of mass politics. So to you, even throughout the 20th century under Stalin,

36:36.840 --> 36:43.720
there is always a force within Ukraine that wants it to be independent.

36:43.720 --> 36:51.800
There were five attempts for Ukraine to declare its independence and to maintain it in the 20th

36:51.800 --> 36:59.160
century. Only one succeeded in 1991, but there were four different attempts before.

36:59.960 --> 37:08.040
And you see the Ukrainian national identity manifest in itself in two different ways,

37:08.760 --> 37:19.000
in the form of national communism after the Bolshevik victory, in Bolshevik controlled Ukraine,

37:19.560 --> 37:25.160
and in the form of radical nationalism in the parts of Ukraine that were controlled by Poland

37:25.560 --> 37:33.880
and Romania. And part of that was also controlled by Czechoslovakia and later Hungary.

37:33.880 --> 37:41.640
So in those parts outside of the Soviet Union, the form of the national mobilization, the key

37:41.640 --> 37:49.080
form of national mobilization became radical nationalism. In Soviet Ukraine, it was national

37:49.080 --> 37:58.920
communism that came back in the 1960s and 1970s. And then in the 1991, the majority of the members

37:58.920 --> 38:03.880
of the Ukrainian parliament who voted for independence were members of the communist party.

38:03.880 --> 38:11.080
So that spirit on a certain level never died. So there's national communism and radical

38:11.080 --> 38:17.400
nationalism. Well, let me ask you about the radical nationalism because that is a topic that comes up

38:18.360 --> 38:25.080
in the discussion of the war in Ukraine today. Can you tell me about Stepan Bandera?

38:25.720 --> 38:29.480
Who was he, this controversial far-right Ukrainian revolutionary?

38:30.920 --> 38:39.560
There are at least two Stepan Banderas. One is the real person and another is mythology that

38:40.440 --> 38:50.360
really comes with this name. The real person was a young student, a nationalistically oriented student

38:50.360 --> 38:55.800
in the late 1920s and early 1930s in the part of Ukraine that was controlled by Poland.

38:57.240 --> 39:04.120
Who belonged to the generation who regretted that they were not born in time for the big struggles

39:04.520 --> 39:12.600
of the World War I and revolution at that time. They believed that their fathers lost opportunity

39:12.600 --> 39:20.840
for Ukraine to become independent and that a new ideology was needed. And that ideology was radical

39:20.840 --> 39:30.280
nationalism and new tactics were needed. So Bandera becomes the leader of the Organization

39:30.280 --> 39:37.320
of Ukrainian Nationalists in Ukraine at the young age and organizes a number of assassinations of

39:37.320 --> 39:46.440
the Polish officials or members of the Ukrainian community who this young people in their 17,

39:46.440 --> 39:57.720
18, 19 considered to be collaborators. He is arrested, put on trial and that's where the myth

39:57.720 --> 40:07.800
of Bandera starts to emerge because he uses the trial to make statements about the

40:09.400 --> 40:16.440
Ukrainian nationalism, radical nationalism and its goals. And suddenly becomes a hero among the

40:17.720 --> 40:26.760
Ukrainian youth at that time. He is sentenced for execution for death. So when he delivers

40:26.760 --> 40:34.120
his speech, he knows that he probably would die soon. And then it was the sentence was commuted

40:35.400 --> 40:42.920
to life in prison. Then World War II happens. The Polish state collapses under the pressure coming

40:42.920 --> 40:52.760
of course from Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Bandera walks away and presides over the act of

40:52.760 --> 40:57.800
the split of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists into two groups. The most radical

40:57.800 --> 41:04.280
one you used to call revolutionary, they call themselves revolutionary, is led by Bandera.

41:06.040 --> 41:12.280
They work together with the Nazi Germany at that time with the hope that Nazi Germany

41:12.280 --> 41:21.320
would deliver them independent Ukraine. First days of the German attack, Nazi attack on the

41:21.320 --> 41:29.800
Soviet Union. The units formed on the basis of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists march into

41:29.800 --> 41:35.800
the city of Lviv and declare Ukrainian independence. That was not sanctioned by

41:35.800 --> 41:42.440
the German authorities. That was not in German plans. So they arrest Bandera,

41:42.440 --> 41:47.400
members of his family, his brothers, members of the leaders of the organization.

41:48.120 --> 41:55.720
So his two brothers go to Auschwitz, die there. He was sent to Sachsenhausen

41:56.520 --> 42:06.920
for most duration of the war until 1944, refusing to revoke declaration of Ukrainian independence,

42:06.920 --> 42:14.200
which again contributes further to his mythology. After the war, he never comes back to Ukraine.

42:14.920 --> 42:26.520
He lives in exile in Munich. So between 1930 and his death in 1959, he spent in Ukraine maybe

42:27.720 --> 42:34.280
up to two years. Maybe a little bit more, but most of the time was either in the Polish prison

42:34.280 --> 42:43.880
or in the German concentration camp or in exile. But the myth of Bandera lived and all the

42:43.960 --> 42:48.680
members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and then the Ukrainian Insurgent Army

42:49.400 --> 42:56.280
that fought against the Soviets all the way into the early 1950s. They were called Banderaids.

42:57.480 --> 43:02.360
They were called Banderaids by the Soviet authorities. They were known also in that

43:02.360 --> 43:09.240
way to the local population. So there was a faraway leader that barely was there on the spot,

43:09.880 --> 43:17.000
but whose name was attached to this movement for really liberation of Ukraine at that time,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.080
again, the battle that failed. The fact that he collaborated with the Nazis

43:21.080 --> 43:27.880
sticks. For one perspective, he's considered by many to be a hero of Ukraine for fighting for

43:27.880 --> 43:34.920
the independence of Ukraine. From another perspective, coupled with the fact that there's

43:34.920 --> 43:40.200
this radical revolutionary extremist flavor to the way he sees the world,

43:41.560 --> 43:48.840
that label just stays that he's a fascist, he's a Nazi. To what degree is this true?

43:51.320 --> 43:57.640
This label is certainly promoted first by the Soviet propaganda and then by Russian propaganda.

43:57.640 --> 44:06.520
It works very nicely. If you focus on the years of collaboration, those were the same years when

44:06.520 --> 44:15.480
Joseph Stalin collaborated with Hitler. We have the same reason to call Stalin

44:15.480 --> 44:21.880
a Nazi collaborator as we have the reason to call Bandera a Nazi collaborator. We

44:22.040 --> 44:28.520
look at the situation in the Pacific, in Indonesia, in other places.

44:29.320 --> 44:36.280
The leaders who worked together with the Japanese with the idea of promoting independence of their

44:36.280 --> 44:41.400
countries after the Japanese collapse become leaders of the empire. So the difference with

44:41.400 --> 44:50.120
Bandera is that he never becomes the leader of empire and immunity that comes with that position

44:50.120 --> 44:58.440
certainly doesn't apply to him. But there are other parts of his life which certainly put this

44:58.440 --> 45:05.400
whole thing in question. The fate of his family, his own time in the German concentration camp

45:06.600 --> 45:15.080
certainly don't fit the propaganda one-sided image of Bandera. In terms of him being a hero,

45:15.480 --> 45:21.880
that's a very interesting question because he is perceived in Ukraine today not by

45:23.960 --> 45:30.280
all and probably not by the majority, but by many people in Ukraine as a symbol of fighting against

45:31.720 --> 45:38.760
the Soviet Union and by extension against Russia and Russian occupation. His popularity grew

45:39.240 --> 45:47.240
after February 24, 2022 as a symbol of that resistance. Again, we are talking here about

45:47.240 --> 45:56.680
myth and mythology because Bandera was not leading the fight against the Soviet occupation

45:58.200 --> 46:03.160
in Ukraine because at that time he was just simply not in Ukraine. He was in Germany and

46:03.160 --> 46:07.320
you can imagine that geography mattered at that time much more than it matters today.

46:07.960 --> 46:12.120
There's a million questions to ask here. I think it's an important topic because it is

46:12.680 --> 46:20.680
at the center of the claimed reason that the war continues in Ukraine. I would like to explore

46:20.680 --> 46:25.800
that from different angles. Just to clarify, was there a moment where Bandera chose

46:27.880 --> 46:32.120
Nazi Germany over the Red Army when the war already began?

46:32.920 --> 46:39.560
So, in the list of allegiances, is Ukraine's independence more important

46:40.280 --> 46:46.360
than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially? The Ukrainian independence was their goal

46:47.160 --> 46:56.120
and they were there to work with anybody who would support them in one way or at least allow

46:56.840 --> 47:02.760
the Ukrainian independence. There is no question that they are just classic nationalists.

47:06.680 --> 47:15.640
Nationalism is the principle according to which the cultural boundaries coincide with

47:15.640 --> 47:23.160
political boundaries. Their goal was to create political boundaries that would coincide with

47:23.160 --> 47:29.640
the geographic boundaries in the conditions of the World War II and certainly making deals with

47:30.600 --> 47:39.160
whoever would either support, as I said, or tolerate that project of theirs.

47:40.120 --> 47:46.520
I would love to find the line between nationalism, even extreme nationalism and fascism and Nazism.

47:47.080 --> 47:55.400
So, for Bandera the myth and Bandera the person, to what degree, let's look at some of the ideology

47:55.400 --> 47:59.480
of Nazism, to which degree did he hate Jews? Was he anti-Semitic?

48:01.800 --> 48:09.960
We know that basically in his circle, there were people who were anti-Semites in a sense that,

48:09.960 --> 48:20.040
okay, we have the texts. We know that. We don't have that information or that sort of evidence

48:20.040 --> 48:29.800
with regard to Bandera himself. In terms of fascism, there is very clear and there is research

48:29.800 --> 48:37.560
done that in particular Italian fascism had influence on the thinking of people in that

48:37.560 --> 48:44.600
organization, including people at the top. But it is also very important to keep in mind

48:46.120 --> 48:50.040
that they call themselves nationalists and revolutionaries.

48:51.160 --> 48:58.840
Despite the fact that in 1939, in 1940, in 1941, it was very beneficial for them

48:59.400 --> 49:08.120
to declare themselves to be Ukrainian fascists and establish this bond not just with Italy,

49:08.120 --> 49:16.920
but with Nazi Germany. They refused to do that. Then they refused to recall their independence.

49:17.560 --> 49:29.720
So influences, yes, but clearly it's a different type of a political project.

49:29.720 --> 49:33.480
So let me fast forward into the future and see to which degree the myth permeates.

49:34.280 --> 49:37.640
Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?

49:38.600 --> 49:40.840
My understanding is there are Nazis in Ukraine,

49:42.280 --> 49:49.000
and there are supporters of white supremacy theories.

49:51.640 --> 49:57.800
But also my understanding is that they are extremely marginal

49:57.800 --> 50:07.800
and they are more marginal than the same sort of groups are in Central Europe,

50:09.880 --> 50:17.880
maybe in the US as well. For me, the question is not whether the Ukraine has it,

50:18.280 --> 50:30.040
but why even in the conditions of the war, the radical nationalism and extremism and white

50:30.040 --> 50:35.400
supremacist is such a marginal force. When in the countries that are not at the war,

50:38.040 --> 50:46.760
you look at France, you look at, again, it's not exactly Nazis, but really radical right is becoming

50:46.760 --> 50:56.040
so important. Why Ukraine in the conditions of the war is the country that manages relations

50:56.040 --> 51:03.320
between different ethnic groups and languages in the way that strengthens political nation?

51:03.320 --> 51:12.840
So for me as a scholar and a researcher, what I see is that in Ukraine, the influence of the far

51:12.840 --> 51:20.520
right in different variations is much lower than it is among some of Ukraine's neighbors

51:20.520 --> 51:26.920
and in Europe in general. The question is why. I don't know. I have guesses. I don't know the

51:26.920 --> 51:36.120
answer, but that's the question that I think is interesting to answer. How Ukraine ended up to be

51:36.120 --> 51:42.040
the only country in the world outside of Israel who has a Jewish president who is,

51:42.920 --> 51:49.320
my at least understanding is, the most popular president in history in terms of how long his

51:49.320 --> 51:56.200
popularity goes after the election. So these are really, from my point of view,

51:56.200 --> 52:00.200
interesting questions. And again, we can certainly debate that.

52:00.600 --> 52:09.160
So just for context, the most popular far right party won 2.15% of the vote in 2019. This is

52:09.160 --> 52:14.520
before the war. So that's where things stood. It's unclear where they stand now. It'd be an

52:14.520 --> 52:19.880
interesting question whether it escalated and how much. What you're saying is that war in general

52:20.680 --> 52:28.120
can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups, of extremist nationalistic groups,

52:28.120 --> 52:35.240
especially like the far right. It's interesting to see to what degree they have or have not

52:35.800 --> 52:41.720
risen to power in the shadows. So no nationalist or nationalistic

52:41.720 --> 52:46.600
party actually crossed the barrier to get into the parliament. So Ukraine is the country where

52:46.600 --> 52:53.160
there is no far right in the parliament. We can't say that about Germany. We can't say that about

52:53.160 --> 53:02.520
France. So that's just one more way to stress this unique place of Ukraine in that sense.

53:03.080 --> 53:11.080
And the year 2018 is the year already of the war. The war started in 2014 with the annexation of

53:11.080 --> 53:18.040
the Crimea. The front line was near Donbass. All these groups were fighting there. So Ukraine,

53:18.040 --> 53:27.240
maybe not to a degree that it is now, was already on the war footing and yet the right party couldn't

53:27.240 --> 53:33.960
get more than 2%. So that's the question that I have in mind. And yes, the war historically,

53:33.960 --> 53:41.800
historically, of course, puts forward and makes the more nationalist views and forces

53:41.800 --> 53:47.960
turn them from marginal forces into more central ones. We talked about Bandera and we talked about

53:48.040 --> 53:53.560
Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. They were the most marginal group in the political

53:53.560 --> 54:01.880
spectrum in Ukraine in the 1930s that one can only imagine. But World War II comes

54:02.840 --> 54:09.480
and they become the most central group because they also were from the start go. They knew

54:10.360 --> 54:15.560
they had the organization. The violence was basically one of their means. They knew how

54:15.560 --> 54:22.120
to fight. So historically, historically wars indeed produce those results. So we are looking

54:22.120 --> 54:27.480
at Ukraine. We are trying to see what is happening there. So Vladimir Putin in his interview with

54:27.480 --> 54:33.000
Taka Carlson, but many times before, said that the current goal for the war in Ukraine

54:34.040 --> 54:42.200
is denazification, that the purpose of the war is denazification. Can you explain this concept of

54:42.200 --> 54:52.280
denazification as Putin sees it? Denazification is the trope that is accepted quite well by the

54:53.320 --> 55:00.040
former Soviet population and Russian population in particular. The most powerful Soviet mythology

55:00.040 --> 55:07.560
that then was basically passed as part of heritage to the Russian Federation was World War II,

55:07.560 --> 55:13.880
was fighting against fascism. So once you use terms fascism and Nazi and denazification,

55:13.880 --> 55:23.080
suddenly people not just start listening, they just stop analyzing. And as a propaganda tool,

55:23.640 --> 55:31.560
this is of course a very, very powerful tool. In terms of to what degree this is the real goal or

55:31.560 --> 55:39.960
not, we discussed the importance of the far right in Europe and in Ukraine. So if that's the real

55:39.960 --> 55:44.760
goal of the war, probably the war would have to start not against Ukraine, but probably against

55:44.760 --> 55:49.800
France or some other country if you take this at face value. Well, there's something really

55:50.360 --> 55:58.840
interesting here, as you mentioned. I've spoken to a lot of people in Russia and you said analysis

55:58.840 --> 56:05.720
stops. In the West, people look at the word denazification and look at the things we've just

56:05.720 --> 56:14.120
discussed and almost think this is absurd. When you talk to people in Russia, maybe it's deep

56:14.120 --> 56:20.680
in there somewhere. The history of World War II still reverberates through maybe the fears,

56:21.640 --> 56:29.320
maybe the pride, whatever the deep emotional history is there. It seems that the goal of

56:29.320 --> 56:38.040
denazification appears to be reasonable for people in Russia. They don't seem to see the absurdity

56:38.040 --> 56:44.520
or the complexity or even the need for analysis, I guess, in this kind of statement, word of

56:44.520 --> 56:54.600
denazification. I would say this is broader. The war that started under the banner that Russians

56:54.600 --> 57:02.200
and Ukrainians were one and the same people and produces that sort of casualty really goes against

57:02.200 --> 57:13.400
also any sort of logical thinking. But Russia is a place where the free press doesn't exist already

57:13.400 --> 57:22.360
for a long period of time. Russia is the place where there is an echo chamber to a degree.

57:23.480 --> 57:32.840
As war started first in 2014 and then all-out war in 2022, I came across a lot of people

57:32.840 --> 57:37.880
on the personal level but also in the media reporting that they really can't find common

57:37.880 --> 57:44.600
language with their close relatives in Russia. People who visited Ukraine who know that it is

57:44.600 --> 57:52.360
not taken over by nationalists and is not taken over by Nazis. But the media around them, the

57:52.360 --> 57:57.880
neighbors around them, the people at their work basically say one and the same thing.

57:58.840 --> 58:10.360
We as humans in general, whatever our background, our mind is relatively easy to manipulate it.

58:13.080 --> 58:22.520
To a degree that even family connections, even family ties don't sometimes help to maintain that

58:22.920 --> 58:28.680
ability to think and to analyze on your own, to look at the facts.

58:30.920 --> 58:37.800
Putin has alluded to the Yaroslav Honka incident in the Canadian parliament September 2023.

58:38.600 --> 58:46.760
This man is a veteran of World War II on the Ukrainian side and he got two standing ovations

58:46.760 --> 58:51.800
in the Canadian parliament. But they later found out that he was part of the SS.

58:53.160 --> 58:55.960
Can you explain on this? What are your thoughts on this?

58:56.600 --> 59:03.240
This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess, propagated throughout the region.

59:04.280 --> 59:14.120
Yes. What happened during World War II was that once the Germans started to run out of

59:14.760 --> 59:24.760
manpower, they created foreign legion groups. But because those people were not Aryans,

59:26.200 --> 59:31.640
they were created for fighting on the battleground. Because they were not Aryans,

59:31.640 --> 59:36.840
they couldn't be trusted. So they were put under the command of Henry Himmler,

59:37.800 --> 59:46.920
under the command of SS and became known as SS Waffen units. One of such units was created in

59:46.920 --> 59:56.040
Ukraine with great difficulties because Nazis didn't consider Slavs to be generally worthy of

59:56.840 --> 01:00:03.240
even that sort of foreign legion formations. But they made an exception because those people

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:08.120
were coming from Galicia, which was part of Austria-Hungary, which means part of Austria,

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:17.080
which means somehow were open to the benevolent influence of the Germanic race and called the

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:30.760
division Galitsyn or Galicia. Part of Ukrainian youth joined the division. One of the explanations

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:38.680
was that they were looking at the experience of World War I and seeing that the Ukrainian units

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.680
in the Austrian army then played a very important role in the fight for independence.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:49.800
That is one of the explanations. You can't just use one explanation to describe motivations of

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:55.240
everyone and every single person who was joining there. So they were sent to the front.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:06.760
And they were defeated within a few short days by the Red Army and then were retreating through

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:13.080
Slovakia where they were used to fight with the partisan movement there and eventually

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:21.800
surrendered to the British. So that's the story. You can personally maybe understand

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:26.760
what the good motivations were of this person or that person.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:37.480
But that is one of the best, one of the very tragic and unfortunate pages in Ukrainian history.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:49.000
You can't justify that as a phenomenon. So from that point of view, the celebration of that

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.600
experience as opposed to looking at that, okay, that happened and we wish that those young men

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:03.320
who were idealistic or joined the division for idealistic purposes had better understanding

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:09.960
of things or made other choices. But you can't certainly celebrate that. And once that happened,

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:22.440
that of course became a big propaganda item in the current war. We are talking about 10,000 to

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:29.880
20,000 people in the division. And we are talking about two to three million Ukrainians fighting in

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:37.880
the Red Army. And again, it's not like Red Army is completely blameless in the way how it behaved

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:44.120
in Prussia or in Germany and so on and so forth. But it's basically, it's again, we are going back

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.880
to the story of Bandera. So there is a period of collaboration and that's what propaganda tries

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:58.520
to define him by. Or there is a division by 20,000 people and somehow it makes irrelevant

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:03.880
the experience of two to three million people. I mean, just to clarify, I think there is just

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.880
a blunder on the Canadian parliament side, the Canadian side of not doing research.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.400
Maybe correct me if I'm wrong, but from my understanding, they were just doing

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:22.280
stupid, shallow political stuff. Let's applaud. When Zelensky shows up, let's have a Ukrainian

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.920
veteran. Let's applaud a veteran of World War II. And then all of a sudden you realize, well,

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:33.240
there's actually complexities to wars. We can talk about, for example, a lot of dark aspects on all

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:39.080
sides of World War II, the mass rape at the end of World War II by the Red Army, when they say

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:46.120
Marshal of Germany. There's a lot of really dark complexity on all sides. So that could be an

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:50.360
opportunity to explore the dark complexity that some of the Ukrainians were in the SS

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:57.240
or Bandera, the complexities there. But I think they were doing not a complex thing. They were

01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:03.000
doing a very shallow applaud, and we should applaud veterans, of course, but in that case,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.240
they were doing it for show for Zelensky and so on. So we should clarify that the applause wasn't

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:17.320
knowing, it wasn't for the SS. It was for a Ukrainian, it was for World War II veterans,

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:24.600
but the propaganda or at least an interpretation from the Russian side,

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.960
from whatever side, is that they were applauding the full person standing before them,

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.520
which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran, but a Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:43.160
I don't have any particular insights, but I would be very much surprised if even one person

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.000
in the parliament, I mean, the members of the parliament actually knew the whole story. I would

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.800
be very surprised. Yeah. The whole story of this person, and frankly, the whole story of

01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:01.720
Ukraine and Russia and World War II, period. Yes, yes. Nevertheless, they had a lot of

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.560
power and really reverberated in support of the narrative that there is a neo-Nazi,

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:12.520
a Nazi problem in Ukraine. This is the narrative that is out there,

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:20.040
and it's especially powerful in Russia. It's especially powerful in Russia, given that there

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:31.880
are, really, the atmosphere that is created really is not conducive to any independent analysis.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.800
Well, I wonder what is the most effective way to respond to that particular

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:43.720
claim, because there could be a discussion about nationalism and extreme nationalism

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:49.000
and the fight for independence and whether it isn't, like Putin wrote, one people.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:54.520
But the question of are there Nazis in Ukraine seems to be a question that could be

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:04.920
analyzed rigorously with data. That is being done on the academic

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:14.200
level. But in terms of the public response and public discourse, the only response that I see

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.640
is not to focus on the questions raised and put by the propaganda, because you already become

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:30.680
victim of that propaganda by definition. But talk about that much broadly and talk about

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.680
different aspects of, if it is World War II, about different aspects of World War II.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:44.200
If it's about issue of the far right in Ukraine, let's talk about US, let's talk about Russia,

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:49.960
let's talk about France, let's compare. That's the only way how you deal with propaganda,

01:06:49.960 --> 01:07:00.760
because propaganda is not necessarily something that is an outright lie. It can be just one factor

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:08.760
that's taken out of the context and is blown out of proportion, and that is good enough.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.520
And the way to defend against that is to bring in the context.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.240
Let us move gracefully throughout back and forth through history.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:26.600
Back to Bandera, you wrote a book on the KGB spy Bogdan Stashinsky. Can you tell his story?

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:32.680
This is a story of the history of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:36.840
and Bandera as well, already after the end of the Second World War.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:45.960
Because what you got after the Second World War, so imagine May of 1945,

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:52.680
the Red Banner is all over Rikstag. The Red Army is in control of half of Europe,

01:07:53.240 --> 01:08:01.080
but the units of the Red Army are still fighting the war, and not just behind the Soviet lines,

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:08.440
but within the borders of the Soviet Union. This war continues all the way into the early 1950s,

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:17.160
almost up to Stalin's death. The war is conducted by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:24.120
which have a Ukrainian insurgent army, and the government tries to crush that resistance.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:34.360
What it does is basically recruits local people to spy on the partisans on the underground,

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:40.200
and Bogdan Stashinsky is one of those people. His family is supporting the resistance.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:49.560
They provide food. His sister is engaged with one of the local commanders of this underground unit,

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:56.840
and they know everything about Stashinsky's family, and they know everything about him,

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:59.960
because he is also collecting funds for the underground.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:08.360
They have a conversation with him saying that, okay, that's what we got, and you and your family

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:17.400
can go to prison, or you help us a little bit. We are interested in the fiancé of your sister,

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:28.680
and we want to get him. Stashinsky says yes. Once they round up the fiancé, he basically betrayed

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:36.200
a member or almost member of his family. He's done. He can't go back to his village. He can't

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:45.240
go back to his study. He was studying in Lviv at that time. As I write in my book, the secret police

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:52.280
becomes his family. He is sent to Kiev. He is trained for two years, sent to East Germany,

01:09:52.280 --> 01:10:04.920
into Berlin, and becomes an assassin. They sent him across the border to Western Germany, to Munich,

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:11.880
which was the headquarter of different organizations, anti-Soviet organizations,

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:19.880
Ukrainian, and Russian, and Georgian, and so on and so forth. He kills two leaders of the

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:27.400
organization of Ukrainian nationalists, one editor of the newspaper, and eventually he kills

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:36.120
Bandera. He does that with the new weapon, a spray pistol, that eventually makes it into the Bond

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:46.440
novel, The Man with the Golden Gun. That whole episode is a little bit reshaped, but it is not

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:55.800
in the film, but it is in the novel itself. Dan later has a change of mind under the influence

01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:07.720
of his German fiancé and then wife. They decide to escape to the West. While they're doing that,

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:12.760
they discover that their apartment was bugged, and probably the KGB knows all of that.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:25.720
A long story short, his son dies in Berlin. The KGB doesn't allow him to go there,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:31.880
but his wife has a nervous breakdown, so they allow him to go there to just calm her so that

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:42.040
there would be no scandal. Two of them, one day before their son's burial, because after that,

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:52.200
they would be sent to Moscow. They jump the ship and go to West Berlin two hours before the Berlin

01:11:52.200 --> 01:12:01.080
Wall was being built. If they would stay for the funeral, probably the KGB would not let them go,

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:08.280
but also if they would stay, the border would be there. He goes to the American intelligence

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.360
and says, okay, that's who I am, and that's what I did. They look at him and they say,

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:20.520
we don't trust you. We don't know who you are. You have documents and five names.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:29.480
You say you killed Bandera. Well, we have different information. He was poisoned and probably by

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:41.880
someone in his clothes circle. A spray pistol? Did you reach too much Ian Fleming? Where does

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:48.920
this come from? He insists. They say, okay, you insist. If you committed all those crimes,

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.880
we're giving you to the German police and German police will be investigating you.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:13:02.600
Then the trial comes and if he says, if he takes back his testimony,

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.640
the whole case against him collapses. He can go free, but he knows that if he goes free,

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:16.840
he is a target of his colleagues from the same department. His task at the trial is to prove that

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:25.880
he is guilty, that he's did that. Then he disappears and nobody knows where he goes. There

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:33.160
are all sorts of cover stories. I was lucky to interview a commander former chief of the

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:40.440
South African police who confirmed to me that Stasinski was in South Africa.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:46.440
The West German intelligence thought that it was too dangerous for him to stay in Germany.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:56.440
They sent him under a different name to South Africa. That's the story of Stasinski himself,

01:13:56.440 --> 01:14:04.280
but going back to Bandera, of course, the fact that he confessed and it became known that KGB

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:12.040
assassinated Bandera that added to the image and to general mythology about Bandera.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:18.520
What a fascinating story of a village boy becoming an assassin who killed one of the most influential

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:30.760
revolutionaries of the region in the 20th century. How powerful was the KGB? What role did it play

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:38.040
in this whole story of the Soviet Union? It depends on the period. At the time that

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.120
we just described, late 50s and early 60s, they were not powerful at all.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:53.720
The reasons for that was that people like Khrushchev were really concerned about the

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:59.720
secret police becoming too powerful. It became too powerful in their mind under Stalin and under

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:10.040
Beria. It was concern about Beria's power as a secret police chief that led to the coup against

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:19.480
Beria. Khrushchev came into power and Beria was arrested and executed. What Khrushchev was trying

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:29.000
to do after that was trying to put, since 54, the name was already KGB, KGB under his control.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:38.200
He was appointing the former Komsomol leaders as the heads of the KGB, so the people who really

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.680
really owed everything to him, that sort of position. The heads of the KGB were not members

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:56.040
of Politburo. It changed in the 70s with Andropov, where KGB started to play again a very important

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:05.000
role in the Soviet history. Let's say decisions on Afghanistan and the Soviet troops marching into

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:13.960
Afghanistan were made by the, apart from Brezhnev, by the trio of the people who would be called

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.600
today syloviki, maybe. Not all of them were syloviki, but one, of course, was Andropov,

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:25.000
the head of the KGB. Another was the minister of defense, and then there was secretary in charge

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.440
of the military industrial complex and minister of foreign affairs. The head of the KGB became

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:39.640
really not just the member of Politburo, but the member of that inner circle. Then the fact that

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:47.480
Andropov succeeds Brezhnev is also a manifestation of the power that KGB acquired really after

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:55.240
Khrushchev in the 1970s and then going into the 1980s. Who was more powerful, the KGB or the CIA

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:04.920
during the Soviet Union? The CIA, it's the organization that is charged with the

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:14.360
information gathering and all sorts of operations, including assassinations in the 50s and 60s

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:25.240
abroad. The KGB was the organization that really had both the surveillance over the population

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:36.680
within the Soviet Union and also the operations abroad and its members, its leaders were members

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:44.200
of the inner circle for making decisions. Again, from what I understand about the way how politics

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:53.400
work and decisions are made in the United States, the chief of the CIA is not one of the decision

01:17:53.400 --> 01:18:00.680
making group providing information. So I would say it's not day and night, but their power,

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.120
political influence, political significance, very different.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:11.480
Is it understood how big the KGB was, how widespread it was, given its secretive and

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.160
distributed nature? Certain things we know, others we don't

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:22.440
because the Stasi archives are open and most of the KGB, especially in Moscow, they're not.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:34.520
But we know that the KGB combined not only the internal secret police functions at home

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:42.120
and counter intelligence branch and intelligence branch abroad, but also the border troops,

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:51.720
for example. Institutionally, it was a huge, huge mammoth. Another thing that we know,

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:59.480
we can sort of extrapolate from what we know from the Stasi archives, that the surveillance at home,

01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:08.280
the surveillance was really massive. The guess is the Soviets were not as effective and as

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:17.320
meticulous and as scrupulous and as methodical as probably as Germans were, but that gives you a

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.920
basic idea of how penetrated the entire society was. What do you think is important to understand

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:29.080
about the KGB if we want to also understand Vladimir Putin, since he was a KGB foreign

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:37.320
intelligence officer for 16 years? From my research, including on the Stasinski,

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:46.440
what I understand is that in KGB, and it was a powerful organization, again, less powerful

01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:53.160
in 50s and 60s, but still a very powerful organization. There was, on the one hand,

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:59.880
the understanding of the situation in the country and abroad that probably other organizations

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:09.560
didn't have. They had also first peak in terms of the selecting cadres. The work in the KGB was

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:17.160
well paid and considered to be very prestigious. That was part, to a degree, of the Soviet elite

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.320
in terms of whom they recruited. They had a resentment toward the party leadership. They

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:29.560
didn't allow them to do James Bond kind of things that they would want to do because they were

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:40.440
political risks. After this scandal with Stasinski, at least on many levels, the KGB

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:47.000
stopped the practice of the political assassinations abroad because it was considered

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.320
politically to be extremely dangerous. The person who was in charge of the KGB at the time of

01:20:53.320 --> 01:21:01.880
Bondera assassination, Shlepin, was one of the candidates to replace Khrushchev. Brezhnev used

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:10.040
against him that scandal abroad, eventually to remove him from Politburo. The KGB was really

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:15.720
looking at the party leadership as, to a degree, ineffective, corrupt, and who was on their way.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:28.760
And from what I understand, that's exactly the attitudes that people like Putin and people of

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:37.960
his circle brought to power in Kremlin. The methods that KGB used, they can use now,

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:44.360
and there is no party or no other institution actually stopping them from doing that.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:53.080
They think about my understanding the operations abroad, about foreign policy in general in terms

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:58.680
of the KGB mindset of planning operations and executing particular operations and so on and so

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:06.600
forth. I think a lot of culture that came into existence in the Soviet KGB now became part of

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:16.040
the culture of the Russian establishment. You wrote the book, The Russo-Ukrainian War,

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:27.000
The Return of History, that gives the full context leading up to the invasion of Ukraine

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:36.280
by Russia in February 2022. Can you take me through the key moments in history that led up

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:41.720
to this war? So we'll mention the collapse of the Soviet Union. We could probably go

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:50.280
much farther back, but the collapse of the Soviet Union mentioned 2014. Maybe you can highlight

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:57.960
key moments that led up to 2022. The key moments would be first the year 204,

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:07.560
known for Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and then the year 2013, known as the Revolution of Dignity.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:15.880
Both were the revolts against something that by significant part of Ukrainian population

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:23.800
was considered to be completely, completely unacceptable actions on the part of the

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:29.480
government and people in the government at that time. So the Orange Revolution of 204

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:39.320
was a protest against falsified presidential elections and rejection of a candidate that was

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:44.120
supported by Russia, publicly supported by Russia. I remember being in Moscow at that time and

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:49.240
couldn't believe my eyes when in the center of Russia I saw a billboard with Yanukovych.

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:55.880
The trick was that there were a lot of Ukrainians in Russia and in Moscow in particular,

01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:08.280
and they had the right to vote. It led to the election as Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko,

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:17.640
who put on the agenda the issue of Ukraine's membership in NATO. So it was very clear pro-Western

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:27.080
orientation. The second case was the Revolution of Dignity 2013 with some of the same characters,

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:33.160
including Yanukovych, who at that time was already president of Ukraine.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:43.480
There the question was of the government promising the people for one year at least

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:50.600
to sign an association agreement with the European Union and then turning over almost overnight

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:58.200
and saying that they were not going to do that. That's how things started. But then when they

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:06.680
became really massive and why something that was called Euro Revolution became Revolution of Dignity

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:19.560
was when the government police beat up students in downtown Kiev. Judging by the reports,

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.040
we're basically already almost ready to disperse, almost ready to go home.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:33.560
That's when roughly half of Kiev showed up on the streets. That sort of the police behavior,

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:42.280
that sort of the was absolutely unacceptable in Ukraine. The stealing elections and falsification

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:51.000
of elections was unacceptable. That's where around that time and around 2004, the president

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:59.800
of Ukraine at that time, Leonid Kuchma writes a book called Ukraine is not Russia. Apparently,

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:08.840
the term comes from his discussion with Putin when Putin was suggesting to him quite strongly

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:17.000
to use force against people on the Maidan on the square in Kiev. Kuchma allegedly said to him,

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:26.040
you don't understand. Ukraine is not Russia. You can't do things like that. You get pushback.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:34.680
That's this two events, 2004 and then 2013, became really crucial point in terms of the

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:42.040
Ukraine direction. The survival of Ukrainian democracy, which is one of very few countries

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:49.480
in the post-Soviet space where democracy survived the original flirt between the

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:58.760
government leaders and democracy of the 1990s. It was the old Soviet story. In Russia, everywhere

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:05.240
else, there was high democratic expectations, but they came pretty much to an end by the end

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:14.680
of the decade. Ukraine preserved the democracy. The orientation of Ukraine toward integration

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:24.040
in some form into Western and European structures. That Ukrainian democracy plus

01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:31.800
Western orientation was something. In Russia, we see the strengthening of the autocratic regime

01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:39.000
under Vladimir Putin. If you look deeper, these are the processes that put the two countries on

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:46.920
the collision course. There's a division, a push and pull inside Ukraine on identity of whether

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:54.120
they're part of Russia or part of Europe. You highlighted two moments in Ukrainian history that

01:27:54.760 --> 01:28:01.880
there's a big flare up where the statement was first Ukraine is not Russia and essentially

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:08.360
Ukraine is part of Europe, but there's other moments. What were the defining moments that

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:13.400
began an actual war in the Donbass? The war started in February of 2014

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:19.880
with the Russian takeover of Crimea by military force, the so-called Green Man.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:32.120
The big question is why? It's very important to go back to the year 2013

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:40.120
and the start of the protests and the story of the Ukraine signing association agreement

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:47.080
with the European Union. From what we understand today, the Ukrainian government under President

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:55.480
Yanukovych did this suicidal sharp turn after one year of promising association agreement saying

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:05.000
that, okay, we changed our mind under pressure from Moscow. Moscow applied that pressure for

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:13.320
one reason, at least in my opinion. The Ukraine signing association agreement with European Union

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:22.760
would mean that Ukraine would not be able to sign association agreement with any Eurasian union in

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:30.600
any shape or form that was at that time in the process of making. For Vladimir Putin,

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:39.880
that was the beginning or part of his third term. One of his agenda items for the third term was

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:48.440
really consolidation of the post-Soviet space and Eurasian space and not membership in NATO,

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:55.080
not membership in European Union. But association agreement with European Union meant that

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:03.560
that post-Soviet space would have to exist under Moscow's control but without Ukraine,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:11.080
the second largest post-Soviet republic. The republic on whose vote depended the continuing

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:16.840
existence of the Soviet Union and whose vote ended in many ways the existence of the Soviet Union.

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:23.560
So that is broadly background but also there are of course personalities, there are also their

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:32.360
beliefs, their readings of history and all of that became part of the story. But if you look

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:41.960
at that geopolitically, the association agreement is Putin putting Ukraine outside of the Russian

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:54.280
sphere of influence and the response was an attempt to topple the government in Kiev that

01:30:54.280 --> 01:31:05.400
clearly was going to sign that agreement to take over Crimea and to help to deal with a lot of

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:13.480
issues within Russia itself and boost the popularity of the president and it certainly

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:23.560
worked in that way as well. Once Ukraine still after Crimea continued on its path,

01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:33.560
then the next step started the so-called hybrid warfare in Donbass. But again, unlike Crimea,

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:40.360
from what I understand Russia was not really looking forward to taking possession over

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:46.040
Donbass. Donbass was viewed as the way how to influence Ukraine to stop it from

01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:51.400
drift toward the west. Maybe you can tell me about the region of Donbass.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:58.680
I mentioned that nationalism and principle of nationalism is the principle of making the

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:07.720
political borders to coincide with ethnic and cultural borders. That's how the maps of many

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:16.280
East European countries have been drawn in the 19th and 20th century. On that principle, Donbass

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:23.080
where the majority constituted by the beginning of the 20th century were Ukrainians,

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:31.320
was considered to be Ukrainian and was claimed in the middle of this revolution and revolutionary

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:41.080
wars and civil wars by Ukrainian government. But Donbass became a site, one of the key sites in the

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:48.440
Russian Empire of early industrialization and its mining industry, its mythological industry.

01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:55.160
What that meant was that people from other parts of, not Ukraine, but other parts of the Russian

01:32:55.160 --> 01:33:00.680
Empire congregated there. That's where jobs were. That's how Khrushchev and his family came

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:07.320
to Donbass. The family of Brezhnev overshoot a little bit. They got to the industrial enterprises

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:16.520
in the city of Kamensk near Dnipro, the city that was called Dnipropetrovsk. Those were Russian

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:28.040
peasants moving into the area looking for their job. The population became quite mixed.

01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:36.040
Ukrainians still constituted the majority of the population, but not necessarily in the towns

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:42.280
and in the cities. Culturally, the place was becoming more and more Russian as the result of

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:52.680
that movement. Apart from the Crimea, Donbass was the part of Ukraine where the ethnic Russians

01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:59.800
were the biggest group. They were not the majority, but they were very big and significant

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:06.760
group. For example, in the city of Mariupol that was all but destroyed in the course of the last

01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:16.840
two years, the ethnic Russians constituted over 40% of the population. That's not exactly part of

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:26.280
Donbass, but that gives you general idea. Now, the story of Donbass and what happened now

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:32.360
is multidimensional. This ethnic composition is just one part of the story. Another very important

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:44.200
part of the story is economy. Donbass is a classical rust belt. We know what happens

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:49.560
with the cities that were part of the first or second wave of industrialization in the United

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:56.600
States. Globally, we know about social problems that exist in those places. Donbass is probably

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:05.560
the most dramatic and tragic case of implosion of the rust belt with the mines not anymore producing

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:14.600
and at the acceptable price, the coal that they used to produce, these people losing jobs,

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:24.120
with the politicians looking for subsidies as opposed to trying very unpopular measures of

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:30.040
dealing something and bringing new money and new investment into the region.

01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:41.240
So, all of that become part of the story that made it easy for Russia, for the Russian Federation,

01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:48.920
to destabilize the situation. We have interviews with Mr. Gherkin, who is saying that he was the

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:56.760
first who pulled the trigger and fired the shot. In that war, he became the minister of defense

01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:04.440
in the Donetsk People's Republic. You look at the prime minister. He is another person with

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:14.920
Moscow residency permit. So, you see key figures in those positions at the start and the beginning,

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:22.200
not being Russians from Ukraine, but being Russians from Russia and Russians from Moscow

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:26.840
closely connected to the government structure and the intelligence structure and so on.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:34.600
That is the start and the beginning, but the way how it exploded, the way it did,

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:42.040
was also a combination of the economic and ethnocultural and linguistic factors.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:51.480
For Putin, the war in Donbass and even in 2022 is a defensive war against what the Ukrainian

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.840
government is doing against ethnically Russian people of Donbass. Is that fair to say how he

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:07.480
describes it? This is certainly the argument. This is certainly the argument and a pretext

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:17.640
because what we see there is that there would be no and there was no independent mobilization

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.840
in Crimea either in Crimea or in Donbass without Russian presence.

01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:31.240
Without Russian occupation de facto of the Crimea, there would be no and there was no before

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:38.360
or at least in the previous five to six years, any mass mobilizations of Russians.

01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:45.640
There was none of such mobilizations in Donbass before Gherkin and other people with

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:57.240
parts of military units showed up there. So, it is an excuse. You've been to Ukraine.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.400
Mm-hmm. You know that Russian language is not

01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:10.440
persecuted in Ukraine. If you've not been to Donbass or to the Crimea, it would be difficult

01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.920
to find one single Ukrainian school. Not that they didn't exist at all, but it would take

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:24.120
quite an effort for you to find it or sometimes even to hear Ukrainian language outside of the

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:34.920
institutions or the farmer's market. So, that's the reality. That's the reality that is clear,

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:40.760
that is visible. So, imagine under those conditions and contexts that someone is

01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:50.520
persecuting ethnic Russians or Russian speakers want to believe in something like that.

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:56.680
One important precondition is never to step your foot in Ukraine.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:02.920
I should mention maybe this is a good moment to mention when I traveled to Ukraine,

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.680
this is after the start of the war, I mentioned farmer's market, which is funny.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.760
Basically, every single person I talked to, including the leadership, we spoke in Russian.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:23.800
For many of them, Russian is the more comfortable language even. And the people who spoke Ukrainian

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:33.160
are more on the western side of Ukraine and young people that are kind of want to show that

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.320
in an activist way that they want to fight for the independence of their country.

01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:43.000
So, I take your point. I wonder if you want to comment about language

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:49.880
and maybe about the future of language in Ukraine. Is the future of language going to

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:58.360
stabilize on Ukrainian or is it going to return to its traditional base of Russian language?

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:05.400
Very roughly, before the start of the war in 2014, we can talk about parity between

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:12.600
Russian and Ukrainian and also with, as you said, clearly Ukraine being a dominant language in the

01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:20.040
west and Russian being a dominant language on the streets, certainly in the east of the country.

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:34.440
Then in between of that to pause a number of these transitional areas. Ukraine, in my experience,

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:41.880
I visited a lot of countries. Not all of them and probably maybe I will be still surprised,

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:49.080
but in my experience, this is the only truly bilingual country that I ever visited. I lived

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:57.880
in Canada for a long period of time. There is Quebec and the rest. In Ukraine, you can talk

01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:04.120
in either Russian or Ukrainian in any part of the country and you would be understood and you would

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:11.880
be responded in a different language with the expectation that you would understand. If you

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:18.120
don't understand, that means you don't come from Ukraine. That's the reality. The war and loss of

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:29.000
the Crimea and partial loss of Donbas, if it's major industrial areas, really shifted the balance

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:43.160
toward mostly Ukrainian speaking regions. Also, what you see and you clearly pointed to that,

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:49.480
starting with 2014, even a little bit earlier, the younger generation chooses Ukrainian

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:58.520
as a marker of its identity. That started in 2014, but we have a dramatic, dramatic

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:08.680
shift after 2022. On the anecdotal level, I can tell you that I speak to people who

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:17.960
be in Chernihiv at the time, this is east of Crimea, at the time of the Russian aggression

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:24.920
and bombardment and so on and so forth, who had passive knowledge of Ukrainian but spoke all their

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:31.640
life Russian. They would speak Ukrainian to me and when I say, okay, why are you doing that? We

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:37.720
know each other for decades and you used Russian. He said, oh, I don't want to have anything in

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:45.640
common with people who did that to us. There is a big, big push, of course, with this current war.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:52.040
Now, the question is whether this change is something that will stay or not, what is the

01:42:52.040 --> 01:43:00.360
future? Linguistic practices are very, very conservative ones. We at the Harvard Ukrainian

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:06.280
Research Institute have a project called Mapa Digital Atlas of Ukraine and we were

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:16.920
documenting and mapping different data in time. What we noticed a spike in the people's self-reporting

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:25.240
of views of Ukrainian in 2014 and 2015 at the time of the start of the war when the threat was

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:32.520
the most clear one. This is self-reporting. That doesn't mean that people exactly do what they

01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:40.360
believe that they are supposed to do and then return back to where it was by the year 2016 and

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:51.800
2017. This dynamic can repeat itself, but given how long the war is going on, how big the impact

01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:59.560
is, how big the stress is, and that the wave of the future is probably associated with younger

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:10.520
people who are switching to Ukrainian. My bet would be on Ukrainian language rising in prominence.

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:21.160
As we get closer to February of 2022, there's a few other key moments. Maybe let's talk about

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:28.120
in July 2021, Putin publishing an essay titled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:33.640
Can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay?

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:41.480
The idea is very conveniently presented already in the first paragraph, in the first sentences

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:48.840
really of the article where Putin says that for a long time I was saying that Russians and Ukrainians

01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:56.600
were one and the same people and here is the proof. This is the historical, he develops his

01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:02.600
historical argumentation apparently with the help of a lot of people around him.

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.000
He started to talk about Russians and Ukrainians being one and the same people

01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:17.560
one year before the start of the war in 2014. In 2013, he was together with Patriarch Kirill

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.320
on visit to Kiev. There was a conference specifically organized for him in the

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:31.880
Kievan Caves monastery and that's where he stated that. The fact that he was with Patriarch Kirill

01:45:31.880 --> 01:45:38.120
is a very important factor for understanding where the idea is coming from.

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:47.560
This is the idea that was dominant in the Russian Empire of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:53.560
century that Russians, Ukrainians and Belorussians are really great Russians,

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:59.800
little Russians and white Russians and that they constitute one people.

01:46:01.800 --> 01:46:10.680
Yes, there are some dialectical differences. Yes, Ukrainians sing well. Yes, they dance funny,

01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:19.320
but overall that doesn't matter. That idea actually was

01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:29.560
really destroyed, mostly destroyed by the revolution of 1917 because it wasn't just

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:35.960
social revolution. That's how it is understood in US and good part of the world. It was also

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.440
national revolution. It was an empire. It was a revolution in the Russian Empire.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:48.680
To bring this pieces of empire back within the Soviet Union, the Bolsheviks had to make

01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:55.720
concessions. One of those concessions was to recognition of the existence of Ukrainians as

01:46:55.720 --> 01:47:00.920
a separate nation, Belorussians as a separate nations, Russians as a separate nations,

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:09.720
endowing them with their own territorial borders, with institutions and so on and so forth.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:16.840
But there was one institution that was not reformed. That institution was called the

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:22.680
Russian Orthodox Church because one of the ways that Bolsheviks dealt with it, they couldn't

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:29.960
eradicate religion completely, but they arrested the development of the religion and

01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:38.680
thinking and theology on the level as it existed before the revolution of 1917.

01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:50.120
The Russian Orthodox Church of 1917 continued to be the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991 and in 2013,

01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:57.720
continuing the same imperial mantra of the existence of one big Russian nation,

01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:08.680
one unified people. When you see the formation of the ideas about nations, about foreign policy

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:16.120
in the Russian Empire after 1991, they're going back to the pre-Bolshevik times.

01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.200
Ukrainians do that as well. Estonians do that as well. The difference is that when Ukrainians go

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:32.440
back, they go back to the pre-1917, their intellectual fathers and writings of basically

01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:37.720
liberal nationalism, or sometimes they go to the radical nationalism of Bandera,

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:46.520
which would be not pre-1917, but pre-1945. When the Russians go to pre-Bolshevik past,

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.400
looking for the ideas, looking for inspiration, looking for the narratives,

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:56.280
what they find there is empire. What they find there are imperial projects.

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:07.560
That's certainly the story of Putin's claim. That's the story of the argument. To conclude,

01:49:07.560 --> 01:49:13.400
the argument that he lays out there, historical argument, comes also almost directly from the

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.480
narratives of the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. It's not only the argument is

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:24.600
coming from that era, but also the argumentation is coming from that era as well.

01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.280
But those arguments are all in the flavor of empire.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.080
It's empire on the one hand, but also there is imperial understanding of what Russian nation is

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:43.160
that doesn't allow for independence of its little Russian and white Russian branches, alleged

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:50.440
branches. What you see is the concept of the big Russian nation that's late 19th,

01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:57.240
beginning 20th century. Empire sees the writing on the wall that nationalism is on the rise,

01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:04.680
and it tries to survive by mobilizing the nationalism of the largest group in the empire,

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:12.360
which happens to be Russian. Stalin is a big promoter of some form of Russian nationalism,

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:18.760
especially during the war and after war. He started his career as a very promising Georgian

01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:27.320
writer, writing in Georgian. So he's not doing that for some personal affinity or

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:36.520
cultural intellectual roots within Russian nation or Russian people. He is doing that

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:43.400
for the sake of the success of his Soviet and communist project.

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:52.920
He has to get the largest ethnic group on board, which are Russians. But Stalin and Putin have

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:59.080
different understanding who Russians are. Stalin already accepted Ukrainians and Belorussians,

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.520
their existence. Putin goes back to pre-Stalin and pre-Lenin times.

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:14.200
So if we step back from the historical context of this and maybe the geopolitical purpose of

01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:21.400
writing such an essay and forget about the essay altogether. I have family in Ukraine and Russia.

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:31.240
I know a lot of people in Ukraine and Russia. Forget the war, forget all of this. They all sound

01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:41.160
the same. If I go to France, they sound different than in Ukraine and Russia. If you lay out the

01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:49.000
cultural map of the world, there's just a different beat and music and flavor to a people.

01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.520
I guess what I'm trying to say is there seems to be a closeness between the cultures of Ukraine

01:51:54.600 --> 01:52:00.600
and Russia. How do we describe that? Do we acknowledge that and how does that

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.600
add tension with the national independence?

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:11.400
First of all, especially when it comes to Eastern Ukraine or to big cities,

01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:20.680
many people in Ukraine spoke Russian. Generally, it's the same language. On the top of that,

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:28.200
we started our discussion with talking about the Slavs. Both Ukrainian and Russian language

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:35.480
are Slavic languages. There is proximity there as well. On the top of that, there is a history of

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:41.640
existence in the Soviet Union and before that, in one empire for a long period of time.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:50.440
So you see a lot of before the war, a lot of Ukrainian singers and entertainers performing

01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:55.400
in Russia and vice versa. Biography of President Zelensky is certainly one of the

01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:07.640
fits that particular model as well. That all talks about similarities. But these similarities

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:16.360
also very often obscure things that became so important in the course of this war.

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:23.640
I already mentioned the book titled by President Kuchma of Ukraine,

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:29.480
Ukraine is not Russia. So that's the argument despite the fact that you think that we are the

01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:37.000
same, we behave differently. It turned out that they behave differently. You have Balotnaya

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:45.000
in Moscow and police violence and that's the end of it. You have Maidan in Ukraine and you

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:53.560
have police violence and that's the beginning. That's not the end. History really matters in

01:53:53.560 --> 01:54:01.000
the way why sometimes people speaking the same language with different accents behave very

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:08.600
differently. Russia and Russian identity was formed around the state and has difficulty

01:54:08.600 --> 01:54:14.600
imagining itself outside of the state and that state happened to be imperial for most of Russian

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:23.400
history. Ukrainian project came into existence in revolt against the state. Ukraine came into

01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:29.400
existence out of the parts of different empires which means they left different cultural impact

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:35.880
on them. For Ukrainians to stay together, autocratic regime so far didn't work.

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:43.320
It's like the colonies of the United States. You have to find common language. You have to

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:52.760
talk to each other. That became part of the Ukrainian political DNA. That became a huge

01:54:52.760 --> 01:55:00.760
factor in the war. Very few people in Ukraine believed what Vladimir Putin was saying that

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:07.240
Russians and Ukrainians were one and the same people. The majority believed that they are

01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:14.360
certainly close culturally and historically nations. From that point of view, the bombardment of the

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:22.280
Ukrainian cities became such a shock to the Ukrainians because deep down they maybe looked

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:27.960
at Syria. They looked at Chechnya and were explaining that through the fact that there

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:35.240
was basically such a big cultural gap and difference between Russians and those countries

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:44.120
and those nations. My understanding at least most of them had difficulty imagining the war

01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:54.360
of that proportion and that sort of ferocity and that sort of war crimes and on that level.

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:59.880
It's interesting that you say that in the DNA of Ukraine versus Russia,

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:12.360
maybe Russia is more conducive to authoritarian regimes and Ukraine is more conducive to

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:16.040
defining itself by rebelling against authoritarian regimes.

01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:26.600
By rebellion, absolutely. That was the story pretty much before 1991. What you see since 1991

01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:33.400
and what you see today is, I would say, a new factor certainly in Ukrainian modern history.

01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:41.400
Ukrainians traditionally were very successful rebels. The largest peasant army in the civil

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:50.440
war in the Russian Empire was the Makhno army in southern Ukraine and one revolt,

01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:57.240
Cossack revolts and other revolts one after another. But Ukrainians had historically difficulty

01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:04.360
actually maintaining the sort of freedom that they acquired, had difficulty associating themselves

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:13.960
with the state. What we see, especially in the last two years, it's a quite phenomenal development

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:21.400
in Ukraine when Ukrainians associate themselves with the state, where Ukrainians see a state not

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:27.400
just as a foreigner, as historically it was in Ukrainian history, not just someone who came to

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:35.480
to take, but the state that is a continuation of them, that helps to provide security for them,

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:42.520
that the Ukrainian armed forces even before the start of this war had the highest

01:57:45.240 --> 01:57:53.720
support and popularity in Ukraine. The state today functions unbelievably effectively under

01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:58.440
attacks and missile attacks and, again, city government and local government.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:06.120
We are witnessing, when it comes to Ukraine, we are witnessing a very important historical

01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:15.560
development where Ukrainians found their state for the first time through most of their history and

01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:24.760
tried to make a transition from successful rebels to successful managers and state builders.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.360
I talked to John Mearsheimer recently. There's a lot of people that believe NATO had a big

01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:39.640
contribution to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. What role did NATO play

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:48.440
in this full history from Bucharest in 2008 to today?

01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:57.800
NATO was a big part, certainly, of the Russian justification for the war.

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:05.320
That was the theme that was up there in the months leading to the aggression.

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:15.480
The truth is that, and Vladimir Putin went on record saying that, that the Western leaders

01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:22.920
were telling him again and again that there is no chance for Ukraine to become a member of NATO

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:33.240
anytime soon. Russia was very effective back in the year 2008 in stopping Ukraine and Georgia

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:42.600
on the path of joining NATO. There was a Bucharest summit at which the US president at that time,

01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:51.640
George W. Bush, was pushing for the membership and Putin convinced leaders of France and Germany to

01:59:51.640 --> 02:00:01.880
block that membership. After that, membership for Ukraine and for Georgia was really removed

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:11.560
from the realistic agenda for NATO. That's what the leaders of the Western world in the month

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:18.600
leading to the February 2022 aggression were trying to convey to Vladimir Putin.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:28.200
What he wanted, there was an ultimatum that really was there not to start negotiations,

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:35.720
but really to stop negotiations. He demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the borders of 1997,

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:41.240
if I'm not mistaken. Completely something that neither leaders would accept nor the

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:48.360
country's members of NATO would accept. For me, it's very clear that that was an excuse,

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:56.680
that that was a justification. What happened later in the year 2022 and 2023 certainly confirms me

02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:10.280
in that belief. Finland joined NATO and Sweden is on the way to joining NATO. Finland joining NATO

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:19.720
increased border between Russia and NATO twofold and probably more than that. If NATO is the real

02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:27.560
concern, it would be probably not completely unreasonable to expect that if not every single

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:35.080
soldier, but at least half of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine would be moved to protect

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:42.440
the new border with NATO in Finland. I have no doubt that no one in Kremlin,

02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:53.400
either in the past or today, looks favorably or is excited about NATO moving or the countries of

02:01:53.400 --> 02:02:01.080
Eastern Europe joining NATO. But I have a very difficult time imagining that that was the primary

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:10.360
cause of the war. What we see also, we talked about Tucker's interview. He was surprised,

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:17.160
but he believed that Putin was completely honest when the first 25 minutes of interview,

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:21.240
he was talking about relations between Russia and Ukraine. He was talking about history.

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:29.240
That was also the main focus of his essay. Essay was not on NATO and Russia.

02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:38.440
His essay was on Russia and Ukraine. That is where the real causes are. The broader context

02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:44.760
is the fall of empire and process of disintegration of empire, not the story of NATO.

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:53.000
What was to clarify the reason Putin, Russia, invaded Ukraine in 2022?

02:02:53.560 --> 02:03:02.360
The immediate goal in 2014 when the war started was to stop the drift of Ukraine toward the West

02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:13.720
and outside of the Russian sphere of influence. The invasion of 2022 perceived the same goals,

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.680
keeping Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:26.360
Once we have the resistance, quite effective resistance on the part of Ukraine,

02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:33.880
the Rammstein and international coalition in support of Ukraine, then we see the

02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:42.200
realization of Plan B where parts of Ukrainian territory are being annexed and included in the

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:47.640
constitution of the Russian Federation. The two scenarios don't exclude each other, but if

02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:56.200
scenario number one doesn't work, then scenario number two goes into play.

02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:03.560
In the Gates of Kiev chapter, you write about Volodymyr Zelensky in the early days of the war.

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:12.200
What are most important moments to you about this time, the first hours and days of the invasion?

02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:18.920
The first hours and the first days were the most difficult psychologically. The rest of the world

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:25.080
really didn't expect Kiev to last for more than a few days, didn't expect Ukraine to last for more

02:04:25.080 --> 02:04:32.920
than a few weeks. All the data suggested that that's what would happen. Ukraine would collapse,

02:04:32.920 --> 02:04:41.720
would be taken over. Putin called his war a special military operation, which suggests

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:49.080
you also expectations about the scope, expectations about the time. Semi-military, semi-police

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:57.240
operation. Every reasonable person in the world believed that that would happen.

02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:07.480
And it's the heroism of quote unquote unreasonable people like Zelensky, like the commander of

02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:13.800
Ukrainian Armed Forces Zoluzhny, like mayors of the cities, Klitschko and others. I'm just naming

02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:21.320
names that are familiar to almost all of us now. But there are thousands of those people,

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:27.000
unreasonable people, who decided that it was unreasonable to attack their country.

02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:40.040
And that was the most difficult times and days. And speaking about Zelensky, every reasonable

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.520
leader in the West was trying to convince him to leave Ukraine and to set a government in exile

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:56.120
in Poland or in London. And it was reasonable to accept one of his predecessors, Mr. Yanukovych,

02:05:56.120 --> 02:06:04.200
fled cave a few months before that in Afghanistan, the president of Afghanistan fled Afghanistan.

02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:14.920
That was a reasonable thing to expect. And he turned out to be very, very unreasonable

02:06:15.560 --> 02:06:23.160
in that sense. That comes with the guts, his guts and guts people around him and Ukrainians in

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:31.320
general. Why do you think he stayed in Kiev? This former comedian who played a president on TV

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:37.800
when Kiev is being invaded by the second most powerful military in the world?

02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.920
Because I think he believes in things.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:50.760
And one of those things was that if he's a president and he's in the presidential

02:06:51.560 --> 02:07:02.120
office, he is there to play his role to the end. And another thing, again, I never met

02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:13.720
Vladimir Zelensky. My personal understanding of him is that he has talent that helped him in his

02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:22.600
career before the presidency and then helps now. He fills the audience and then channels the

02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:32.920
attitude of the audience and amplifies it. And I think that another reason why he didn't leave

02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:40.200
Kiev was that he felt the audience, the audience in that particular context for the Ukrainians.

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:46.040
So he had a sense that the Ukrainians would unify because he was quite, if you look at the polls

02:07:46.040 --> 02:07:54.200
before the war, quite unpopular. And there was still divisions and factions and the government

02:07:54.200 --> 02:07:59.800
is divided. There's the East and the West and all this kind of stuff. You think he had a sense that

02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:09.960
this could unite people? The East and the West was not already such an issue after Crimea and

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:16.520
part of Donbass being gone. So Ukraine was much more united than it was before.

02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:25.320
He brought to power his before that really non-existent party of regions

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:32.280
on his personal popularity. But the important thing is that he created a majority in the

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:39.800
parliament, which really reflected the unity that existed among Ukrainians that was not there before.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:50.200
He won with 73% of the population of those who took part in the elections. His predecessor,

02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:58.280
Petro Poroshenko, also carried 90% of the precincts and the same happened with Zelensky.

02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:07.400
So the country unified after 2014 to a degree it was impossible to imagine before. And Zelensky

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:19.080
felt that. Zelensky knew that. And that's where the talent of politicians really matters. That's

02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:28.120
something that you can see beyond just data and you can feel that. Apparently, Yeltsin had that

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:35.080
ability. Why did the peace talks fail? There was a lot of peace talks.

02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:43.960
Well, the main reason is that the conditions that Russia was trying to impose on Ukraine

02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:53.000
were basically unacceptable for Ukraine. Because one of the conditions apart from this strange

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:59.800
thing called denazification was, of course, de facto loss of the territory and for the future,

02:09:59.800 --> 02:10:10.200
really staying outside either of NATO or any Western support, which was very clear you can

02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:14.840
buy a couple of weeks, you can buy a couple of months, but in the conditions like that,

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:23.400
Russia will come back tomorrow and will take over everything. And once Ukrainians realized

02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:31.560
that they can win on the battlefield, once the Russians were defeated and withdrew from Kiev,

02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:41.880
the opportunity emerged to get out of the negotiations, which was very clear were

02:10:41.880 --> 02:10:48.040
leading, if not today, then tomorrow to the complete destruction of Ukraine. And then,

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:54.120
of course, once the territory started to be liberated, things like butcher and massacres

02:10:54.120 --> 02:11:00.600
of the civilian population came to the fore, which made also very difficult, if not impossible,

02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.480
to conduct negotiations from this moral and emotional point of view.

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:12.360
What about the claims that Boris Johnson in the West compromised the ability of these peace talks

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:17.240
to be successful? Basically, you kind of manipulated the talks.

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:26.200
I asked people who accompanied Boris Johnson to give that question. The answer was no,

02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:35.960
and I believe this answer, and I'll tell you why. Because it is very difficult for me

02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:46.280
to imagine President Zelensky to take orders from anybody in the world,

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:53.640
either Boris Johnson or Joe Biden or anybody else, and basically doing things that

02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:02.040
Zelensky believes are not in his interest or in the interest of his country. I just can't

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:10.360
imagine that anybody in the world telling Zelensky what to do and Zelensky actually

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:17.400
following it against his own wishes and desires. At least, if that is possible,

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.440
what is in the public sphere doesn't allow us to suggest that it is.

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:31.080
That said, Zelensky is a smart man, and he knows that the war can only continue with the West's

02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:37.800
support. That is a different position to know that it can continue with the West's support,

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:45.240
but if we are talking about withdrawing from the negotiations, that's not about the continuation

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:53.960
of the war, that you don't need Western support. Well, what I mean is if he started to sense that

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.800
the West will support no matter what, then maybe the space of decisions you're making is different.

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:09.880
We can interpret that that way, but Boris Johnson represented at that point Britain,

02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:18.360
not the United States. What the war showed, and it was clear already at that time,

02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:27.720
that what was needed was massive support from the West as a whole. The promise of that support

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:36.360
came only after the West realized that Ukraine can win and came only in late April with the

02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:44.040
Rammstein, so at least a few weeks later. I don't know how much Boris Johnson could promise. He

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:49.480
probably could promise to try to help and try to convince and try to work on that.

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:56.120
If Zelensky acted on that promise, he certainly was taking a risk. But the key issue, again,

02:13:56.120 --> 02:14:03.080
I'm going back where I started, it's principle and acceptance for Ukraine, the conditions that

02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:14.440
were offered. The moment they saw the possibility that they could fight back with Johnson's support,

02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:20.440
without Johnson's support, they took the chance. What are the ways this war can end, do you think?

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:27.320
What are the different possible trajectories, whether it's peace talks? What does winning look

02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:31.880
like for either side? What is the role of US? What trajectories do you see that are possible?

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:40.440
It's a question on the one level, very easy to answer on the other, very difficult. The level

02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:49.080
on which it is very easy, it's a broad historical perspective. If you really believe, and I believe

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:54.920
in that, that this is the war of the Soviet succession, that this is the war of the

02:14:54.920 --> 02:15:04.680
disintegration of empire, we know how this story ends. They end with disintegration of empire.

02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:10.680
They end with the rise of the new states and the appearance of the new colored sports on the map.

02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:18.120
That's the story that started with the American Revolution. That's long-term perspective.

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.840
The difficult part is, of course, what will happen tomorrow. The difficult part is what

02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:34.840
there will be in two days or even in two years. In very broad terms, the war can end in one of

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:42.280
three scenarios, the victory of one side, the victory of another side, and a stalemate and

02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:51.320
compromise, especially when it comes to the territories. This war is already approaching

02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:59.640
the end of the second year. I follow the news and look analysis. I don't remember one single

02:15:59.640 --> 02:16:05.000
piece suggesting that the next year will bring peace or will bring peace for sure.

02:16:08.600 --> 02:16:17.560
We are in a situation where both sides still believe that they can achieve something or

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:22.600
improve their position on the battlefield. Certainly, that was the expectations of

02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:32.280
Ukrainian side back in the summer and early fall of 2023. From what I understand now,

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.080
this is certainly the expectations of the Russian side today.

02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:44.600
This is the largest war in Europe since World War II, the largest war in the world since Korean War.

02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:57.000
And we know that the Korean War ended in this division of Korea, but the negotiations were

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:03.080
going on for more than two years. While those negotiations were going on, both sides were trying

02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:09.960
to improve their position there. And until there was a political change, the death of Stalin,

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:18.280
arrival of Eisenhower in the United States, and the realization that the chances of succeeding

02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:27.400
on the battlefield are huge, the peace talks didn't come. At this point, all three scenarios

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:34.600
are possible. I don't really discount any of them. It's early to say what will happen.

02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:37.800
Without any political change, let's try to imagine

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:45.400
what are the possibilities that the war ends this year? Is it possible that it can end

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:52.600
with compromise basically at the place it started? Meaning back to the borders of 2022?

02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:59.320
Yeah, back to the borders of 2022 with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees,

02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:06.760
but are hopeful guarantees. No, it is not just virtual impossibility. It is impossible without

02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:17.720
political change in Moscow. The reason is that back in the fall of 2022, Vladimir Putin included

02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.920
five of Ukrainian regions, oblasts, even those that he didn't control or didn't control fully

02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:31.080
into the Russian constitution, which basically in simple language is that the hands are tied

02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:38.280
up not only for Putin himself, but also for his possible successors. That means that no return

02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:48.840
to the borders of 2022 without political change in Moscow are possible. A few days after that

02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:57.400
that decision in Moscow, Zelensky issued a decree saying that no negotiations with Russia.

02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:04.760
What that really meant in plain language is that basically we are not prepared to negotiate a stable

02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:12.120
agreement with five of our oblasts, not just the next, but also included into the Russian constitution.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:21.800
That's where we are. Again, everything is possible, of course, but it's highly,

02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:26.920
highly unlikely. The Russian constitution is a thing that makes this all very difficult.

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:33.880
Yes, and not only as a negotiation tactic for Putin or whoever would negotiate on the Russian

02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:40.120
side, but also as a legal issue. The practical aspect of it even is difficult.

02:19:40.120 --> 02:19:47.000
You really have to change the constitution before the peace agreement takes hold or

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.360
immediately after that. With the Minsk agreements, that was one of the things that

02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:57.480
Russia wanted from Ukraine, change of the constitution, and it turned out to be

02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:05.560
really impossible. That's one of the backstories of the Minsk and collapse of the Minsk agreements.

02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:11.320
Is there something like Minsk agreements that are possible now? Maybe this is a legal question,

02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:18.200
but to override the constitution, to sort of shake everything up? See the constitutional

02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:25.000
amendment as just a negotiation tactic to come to the table to something like Minsk agreement.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:31.240
Given how fast those amendments to the constitution were adopted,

02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:40.360
that suggests that really executive power in Russia has enormous power over the legislative

02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:48.120
branch. It's, again, difficult to imagine, but technically this is possible, but possible if

02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:52.760
there is a political change in Moscow. I don't understand why assuming political

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:58.520
change in Moscow is not possible this year. I'm trying to see if there's a way to end this war

02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:07.160
this year. There is a possibility of armistice, but armistice more along the, like any armistice,

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:14.280
along the lines of the current front lines. But withdrawal of the Russian troops to the borders

02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:20.760
of 2022 at this point, whether it's reasonable or unreasonable, can be achieved all only as the

02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:26.760
result of the defeat of the Russian army, like it happened near Kiev. Is it possible? Is it

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:34.440
likely, especially given what is happening with the Western support, military support for Ukraine?

02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:41.800
Probably not. But if Putin, the executive branch, has a lot of power, why can't the United States

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:47.240
president, the Russian president, the Ukrainian president come to the table and draw up something

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:53.880
like the Minsk agreements where, and then rapid constitutional changes made, and you go back to

02:21:54.840 --> 02:22:03.160
the borders of 2022, before 2022, like through agreements, through compromise, impossible for

02:22:03.160 --> 02:22:10.600
you? Certainly not this year. I look at this year as the time when at least one side, Russian side,

02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:18.040
will try to get as much as it can through the, through military means. But that's been happening

02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:22.920
last year too. There's been a counteroffensive, there's been attempts, there's been- It doesn't

02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:34.440
mean that every new year somehow is supposed to bring new tactics. The last year was pretty much

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:42.760
a lot of fighting, a lot of suffering, very little movement of the front line. The biggest

02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:51.400
change of the last year was Ukraine victory on the Black Sea, where they pushed the Russian

02:22:51.400 --> 02:23:01.480
Navy into the western part of the pond and restored the grain corridor and export from

02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:10.200
Odessa, apparently up to 75% of what it used to be before the war. So that's the only major change,

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:17.800
but again, the price is enormous in terms of wealth, in terms of, especially in terms of lives.

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:24.600
So thinking about what 2024 brings, Zelensky just fired Ukraine's head of the army,

02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:32.040
a man you've mentioned, General Valeriy Zeluzhny. What do you make of this development?

02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:42.600
This is a very, very dangerous moment in the war. The reason for that is that Zeluzhny is someone

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:51.080
who is very popular with the army and with people in general. So if you look at that through American

02:23:51.080 --> 02:24:00.120
prism, that would be something analogous to President Truman firing General MacArthur,

02:24:02.600 --> 02:24:09.080
given that stakes for US at that time were very high, but probably not as high as they are

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:18.600
for Ukraine today. In both cases, what is at stake is certainly the idea that the political

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:26.120
leadership and military leadership have to be on the same page. And the question is whether on the

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:34.440
part of Zelensky, this is just the change of the leadership or this is also the change of his

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:42.760
approach to the war. And then it can mean many things. One can mean him taking more active part

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:50.200
in planning operations. It can mean also possible change of the tactic in the war,

02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:57.960
given that counteroffensive didn't work out. We don't know yet. I don't know whether President

02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:05.800
Zelensky at this point knows exactly what will come next. But this is the time when the change

02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:13.960
of the leadership in the country and in the army that is at war, it's one of the most dangerous

02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:20.440
moments. So the thing that President Zelensky expressed is that this is going to be a change

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:26.600
of tactics, making the approach more technologically advanced, this kind of things.

02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:35.880
But as you said, I believe he is less popular than the chief of the army,

02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:44.200
Zelensky, 80% to 60% depending on the polls. Do you think it's possible that Zelensky's days are

02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:51.080
numbered as the president and that somebody like Zelensky comes to power?

02:25:51.880 --> 02:26:03.080
What we know is that in this war, Ukrainian people really united around their president.

02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:10.200
The armed forces were always, even before the start of the war, more popular than

02:26:10.200 --> 02:26:19.000
was the presidential office. So the change, if happened in that realm, was not so dramatic.

02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:26.600
And from what I can see from social media in Ukraine, there is a lot of unhappiness,

02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:34.840
a lot of questions, but there is also realization and very strong realization that country has to

02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:45.000
stay united. And certainly the behavior of Zelensky himself is there basically not suggesting any sort

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:53.400
of prigozhin type of scenario. That gives me some hope, actually a lot of hope.

02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:59.960
And in terms of whether Zelensky's days are numbered or not, I don't think they're numbered.

02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:08.680
But if Ukraine stays a democracy, and I believe it will stay, what comes to my mind

02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:19.160
is the story of Churchill, the story of de Gaulle. In Poland, the story of Pilsudski.

02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:27.720
Once the war is over, really the electorate in the democratic elections, they want to change the

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:35.800
political leadership. They want to move forward. But Pilsudski came back to power and de Gaulle

02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:43.960
came back to power and Churchill came back to power. So no, whatever happens in the short run

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:50.680
or medium term run, I think that Zelensky's days in politics are not numbered.

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:56.360
So what to you is interesting, for example, if I get a chance to interview Zelensky,

02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:02.200
what to you is interesting about the person that would be good to ask about, to explore

02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:05.960
what the state of his mind is thinking, his view of the world as it stands today?

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:13.960
Next month, we're supposed to take place Ukrainian elections. They're not taking place

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:20.440
because the majority of Ukrainians don't think this is the right thing to do,

02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:25.240
to change the president, to have the elections, to have a political struggle in the middle of the war.

02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:35.240
So Zelensky refused to call those elections despite the fact that he is and continues to be

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:41.320
the most popular politician in Ukraine. So it would be to his benefit, but that's clearly not

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:49.080
what the Ukrainians want. But the question of continuing as the president beyond five years,

02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:54.040
also one way or another would raise questions about the legitimacy.

02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:01.880
And certainly Russia will be playing this card like there is no tomorrow. And what I would be

02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:09.080
interested in asking Zelensky about, whether he sees that his second term,

02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:17.560
which comes on those conditions, would suggest a different attitude toward the opposition,

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:25.960
maybe some form of the coalition government, like it was the case in Britain with Churchill

02:29:25.960 --> 02:29:31.080
under different circumstances, of course. Or this is basically, in his opinion, something that would

02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:38.200
be destructive and something that would really be an impediment for the question of unity and

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:47.560
war effort. And I would ask this question not to basically suggest that that's the way to go.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:53.640
But I would be very much interested to hear what is his thinking about that.

02:29:54.280 --> 02:30:01.080
Do you think there is a degree during wartime that the power that comes with being a war

02:30:01.080 --> 02:30:09.800
president can corrupt a person, sort of push you away from the democratic mindset

02:30:11.640 --> 02:30:16.680
towards an authoritarian one? I think that there is a possibility of that,

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:25.240
right? In the conditions of any emergency, the war, in the case of the Soviet Union,

02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:31.800
there was a Chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth, you make decisions much faster.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:42.200
You create this vertical and then it's very easy to get really used to that way,

02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:47.880
dealing with the issues in the conditions of emergency, right? And then if they continue

02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:57.240
emergency or with no emergency, they are continuing the emergency mode. I think, again,

02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:04.760
that would be a very natural thing for any human being to do, to make it easier.

02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:12.520
Should I do that easier and in a more effective way or should I do it the right way? That's a

02:31:12.520 --> 02:31:19.080
challenge. Sometimes it's difficult to answer this question. Let me stay in power for just a

02:31:19.080 --> 02:31:26.600
little longer to do it the efficient way. And then time flies away and all of a sudden you're going

02:31:26.600 --> 02:31:31.000
for the third term and the fourth term. And suddenly it's easier to realize that actually

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:38.920
you can't rule in any other way. Whatever skills you had of people around that can help is that

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:45.800
already gone. Exactly. The people that surround you are not providing the kind of critical

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:51.560
feedback necessary for a democratic system. One of the things that Tucker said after his interview

02:31:51.560 --> 02:32:02.920
with Putin, he was just in his hotel, just chatting on video. And he said that he felt like Putin was

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:11.480
not very good at explaining himself, like a coherent whole narrative of why the invasion

02:32:11.480 --> 02:32:17.560
happened. It's just this big picture. And he said that's not because he doesn't have one, but

02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:24.440
it's been a long time since he's had somebody around him where he has to explain himself to.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.400
So he's out of practice, which is very interesting. It's a very interesting point.

02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:38.280
And that's what war and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do. So on that topic,

02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:42.760
if you had a chance to talk to Putin, what kind of questions would you ask him? What would you

02:32:42.760 --> 02:32:48.840
like to find out about the man as he stands today? As a historian, I have a lot of questions and I

02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:57.160
have questions about when the decision was made to attack Ukraine and what went into this decision

02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:05.080
because we are thinking about that. So as a historian, I have this big question. I have

02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:13.720
question about the Crimea when those decisions were made. So that sort of questions that interest

02:33:13.720 --> 02:33:19.720
me. But the rest either I think that I understand what is going on with him or I don't expect the

02:33:19.720 --> 02:33:27.400
answer that can help. For example, a good question, whether you regret or not the start

02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:37.640
of the war in 2022 given the enormous casualties on both sides. But you can't expect from a

02:33:37.640 --> 02:33:44.680
politician an honest answer to this question. So there are questions to which I know he can't

02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:50.200
answer honestly. And then there are other questions to which I think he already provided

02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:58.840
all answers that he could. So what for me is of interest are basically questions for a historian

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:07.480
about the timing and the logic of particular decisions. I do wonder how different what he

02:34:07.480 --> 02:34:12.280
says publicly is from what he thinks privately. So a question about when

02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:20.600
the decision to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question to give insight to

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.960
the difference between how he thinks about the world privately versus what he says publicly.

02:34:28.600 --> 02:34:35.800
And same about empire. Because if you ask Putin, he will say he has no interest in

02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:43.160
empire and he finds the notion silly. But at the same time, perhaps privately,

02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:52.600
there's a sense in which he does seek the reunification of the Russian Empire.

02:34:53.160 --> 02:34:56.760
Not in the form of the Russian Empire, not in the form of the Soviet Union,

02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:05.560
but certainly in some form of the Russian control. That's for me at least, it's quite clear.

02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:16.760
Otherwise, there would be no busts to the Russian emperors and Catherine and Peter and others.

02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:24.200
You wrote in your book titled The Frontline Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:33.720
about the Russian question. I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn first in 1994. Solzhenitsyn,

02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:40.760
of course, is the author of Gulag Archipelago. He's half Ukrainian. What is the Russian question?

02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:50.520
Solzhenitsyn clearly identifies himself as Russian. And his opposition to the communist regime was

02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:59.640
opposition of a Russian nationalist. So his argument was that communism was bad for Russia.

02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:11.080
And for him, Russian question is about the ethnic Russians, but also he was thinking

02:36:12.520 --> 02:36:18.040
about Russians in Putin's terms or Putin thinks in Solzhenitsyn's terms,

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:22.360
about Ukrainians and Belarusians constituting part of that.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:29.080
So the Russian question is the biggest tragedy of the 20th century, the division of the Russians,

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:35.800
the loss of the statehood and division of the Russians between different states. This is for

02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:46.920
Solzhenitsyn Russian question. And his original idea and plan was presented in the essay that he

02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:54.200
published in 1990. It was called How We Should Restructure Russia. And Restructure Russia meant

02:36:54.200 --> 02:37:01.560
getting rid of the Baltics, Central Asia, Caucasus, and have Russians, Ukrainians,

02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:08.360
and Belarusians, including those who live in Northern Kazakhstan, to create one nation state.

02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:15.720
So he was a Russian nationalist, but he was thinking about Russian nation state as the state

02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:23.640
of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians. And once the Soviet Union collapsed and his idea was not

02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:33.000
implemented, in the 1990s, he formulated Plan B, taken over by Russia of Donbass, Crimea,

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:39.960
and Southern Ukraine, the areas that now are included in the Russian constitution.

02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:49.160
So in terms, in historical terms and intellectual terms, what is happening today in the war between

02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:58.920
Russia and Ukraine is the division on one level or another level that was formulated by the noble

02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.400
laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, half Russian, half Ukrainian.

02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:10.600
If there is such a thing, what would you say is the Ukrainian question as we stand today?

02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:17.960
The Ukrainian question is very simple. Now it's not any more acquisition of the nation state,

02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:24.920
but actually a sovereign state, but its maintenance. So the Ukrainian question

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:32.600
is like dozens of other questions in the 20th and 21st century, the rise of the new state.

02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:40.600
And that's what is the Ukrainian question, whether Ukraine will continue to its existence

02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:47.160
as a nation, as an independent state, because that existence is being questioned by

02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.440
stating that Russians and Ukrainians are one and the same people, which de facto is saying

02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:57.720
your guy is Russian, and also trying to destroy the state.

02:38:58.600 --> 02:39:05.960
Is it possible that if the war in Ukraine continues for many more years, that the next

02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:13.320
leader that follows Zelensky would take Ukraine away from a sort of democratic,

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:20.520
Western-style nation towards a more authoritarian one, maybe even with a far-right influence,

02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:24.920
this kind of direction because of the war, the influence of war?

02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:31.720
Everything is possible. And the longer the war continues, the more likely

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:40.680
scenario like that becomes. But realization of that scenario would go against the grain of

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:52.120
largest part of Ukrainian history, where Ukraine really emerged as a pluralistic state on which

02:39:52.120 --> 02:40:00.200
the elements of democracy were built in the last 30 years, would go against the grain of the

02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:06.440
Ukrainian society, where as one author formulated in the 1990s, he wrote a book,

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:13.640
Ukrainian Nationalism, a Minority Faith, where the nationalist was a minority faith and radical

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:19.640
nationalism continues to be, at least continued to be in 2019, a minority faith during the last

02:40:19.640 --> 02:40:27.000
elections. So possible, but unlikely given the historical realities of the last 30 plus years.

02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:35.560
I could talk to you for many more hours on Chernobyl alone. Since you've written a book

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:39.960
on Chernobyl and nuclear disaster, there's just a million possible conversations here.

02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:48.440
But let me just jump around history a little bit. Back before World War II, my grandmother

02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:55.640
lived through Holodomor in World War II, Nazi-occupied Ukraine. Holodomor,

02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:04.120
what do you learn, let's say about human nature and about governments and nations

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:10.520
from the fact that Holodomor happened? And maybe you could say what it is and why it happened.

02:41:11.160 --> 02:41:22.760
Holodomor is a massive famine in Ukraine between the years 1932 and 1934. And it happened as the

02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:33.320
result of forceful collectivization of the agriculture. And a tamp on the part of Stalin

02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:44.920
also really rolled Ukraine into the Soviet Union with basically no potential opposition from Ukraine,

02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:53.800
and now national communists. So two things came together in December of 1932 when in the same

02:41:53.800 --> 02:42:01.320
decree, Stalin and Molotov signed a decree on the requisition of the grain, which lead eventually to

02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:08.840
the mass starvation and on the banning of Ukrainian language publications and education in other

02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:16.920
the Soviet republics outside of Ukraine and introducing limitations on the so-called

02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:23.880
Ukrainianization policies. So on the use of Ukrainian language in Ukraine itself.

02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:35.240
And the numbers are debated. The numbers that most of the scholars work today are four million,

02:42:35.240 --> 02:42:47.640
but again, there are larger numbers as well that circulate. And the famine of 32-33 was not exclusive

02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:55.320
Ukrainian phenomenon. But most of Ukraine in the Soviet Union died in Ukraine.

02:42:55.320 --> 02:43:02.600
And Ukraine was the only place where the policy on collecting grain were coming together with the

02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:08.200
policy of the cleansing of the political leadership, sending people from Moscow to take over

02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:17.320
the leadership and attack on Ukrainian culture. So in terms of what I learn about human nature,

02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:27.720
it's more me learning about the ideologies of the 20th century because it's not the only famine

02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:33.000
in the communist lands. The famine in China, which was in terms of the numbers, much more

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.600
devastating than that. It's in a different category and for a good reason, but you have Holocaust.

02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:47.800
What unites these things is the time. This is 20th century.

02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:57.080
What unites them are the dominance in the societies that are doing that, really ideologies

02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:07.400
that not just devalued human life, but considered that actually the way forward is by destroying

02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:12.600
large group of populations defined ethnically, religiously, socially, or otherwise.

02:44:14.520 --> 02:44:20.600
Which tells about the time, but tells also about humanity because for centuries before that,

02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:28.600
human life was valued. There were enemies, but the idea was that human life can put and you can,

02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:35.160
at the end of the day, they can be slaves. You can use them for productive force.

02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:41.960
Countries in the 18th century with Southern Ukraine, they were looking for settlers for

02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:47.880
people to bring and live on land. You move into the 20th century and there is mass destruction

02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:56.200
of the population in the name of ideologies, which basically are by definition destroy human

02:44:56.200 --> 02:45:03.240
lives. That's what's really so shocking and striking because that's the break with

02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:11.960
not just with issues of morale, not just with issues of humanity, with any common sense

02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:20.920
what is happening. I am absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson.

02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:28.360
I am absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson. With turning our page on fascism and

02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:34.760
communism, we somehow decided that we are free of that. That at least in those terms, history

02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:40.280
came to an end. What is ahead is the future. Nothing of that sort would

02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:49.160
happen, would take place to a degree that people would get in trouble for comparing any statements

02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:55.480
or events that are happening today with the communism or fascism.

02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:09.560
So, I feel responsibility of myself and as a historian in particular for not doing a better

02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:22.440
job about telling people that, well, we are who we are and we have as humans our dark side and

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:27.640
we have to be very careful. So, there is a human capacity

02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:37.720
to be captured by an idea, an ideology that claims to bring up a better world as the Nazis did, as

02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:47.000
Soviet Union did and on the path of doing that devaluing human life. That we will bring a

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:52.120
better world and if millions of people have to be tortured on the way to that,

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:58.120
all right, but at least we have a better world and human beings are able to,

02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:05.880
if not accept that, look the other way. Yes. And in the name of a particular nation or race,

02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:11.800
like it was the Third Reich or in the name of the humanity of the future.

02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:16.600
So, not just devalue human life, destroy human life.

02:47:16.600 --> 02:47:22.200
Is there something fundamental about communism and centralized planning that's part of the

02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:29.560
problem here? Maybe this also connects the story of Chernobyl where the Chernobyl disaster is not

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:36.120
just a story of failure of a nuclear power plant, but it's an entire institution

02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:42.200
of the scientific, the nuclear institution, but the entirety of the government.

02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:48.520
There is and there is a number of factors of political and social character that produced

02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:57.240
Chernobyl and one of them is generally the atmosphere of secrecy in the Soviet Union

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:05.720
in the conditions of the Cold War. Chernobyl reactor was a dual purpose reactor.

02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:12.760
It could boil water today and produce enriched uranium tomorrow, right? So, it was top secret.

02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:19.800
If there were problems with that reactor, those problems were kept secret even at people who

02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:29.000
operated the reactor. That's what happened in Chernobyl. Another big, big part of the story,

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:38.440
which is specifically Soviet, that's the nature of the managerial culture and administrative

02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:45.480
culture in which people had no right to make their own decisions in their place, in their position.

02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:53.480
A few years before that Three Mile Island happened, which was a big, big nuclear disaster,

02:48:53.480 --> 02:49:01.800
but in terms of consequences, nothing like Chernobyl. There in the context of the American

02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:10.760
legal culture and managerial culture, people who were operators, who were in managerial positions,

02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:16.440
that was their responsibility to take decisions. President Carter came there,

02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:22.680
but he was not calling shots on none of those issues. What you see with Chernobyl and people

02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:31.240
who saw HBO series know that very well. The moment the high official arrives, everyone actually falls

02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:37.400
in line. It's the official who calls the shot. To move population from the city of Pripyat,

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:47.400
you needed the okay coming from Moscow from the very top. That is Soviet story. There is a global

02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:56.200
story of cutting corners to meet either deadlines, like it was with that test that they were running

02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:03.160
at that time, or to meet production quotas. This is not just socialist thing. You can

02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:13.720
replace production quotas with profit and you get the same story.

02:50:14.280 --> 02:50:23.400
So, some parts in that story are generally reflective of our today's world in general.

02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:28.280
Others are very specific, very specific for Soviet Union, for Soviet experience.

02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:38.040
The biggest probably Soviet part of that story is that on the one hand, the government in Moscow

02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:44.760
and Kiev, they mobilize all resources to deal with that. But they keep information about what

02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:52.440
is happening and the radiation clouds secret from the rest of the population, something that

02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:57.880
completely would be impossible and was impossible in US and UK, where other accidents happened.

02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:06.440
Then guess what? A few years later, the Soviet Union collapses very much,

02:51:07.080 --> 02:51:13.640
also thanks to the mobilization of people over the issue of Chernobyl and nuclear energy.

02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:23.800
People writing about that subject call it ecological nationalism, which comes

02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:33.640
at least in part from withholding information from people. In Ukraine, mobilization that led to

02:51:33.640 --> 02:51:38.520
independence didn't start over the issue of language or didn't start over the issue of

02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:45.320
national autonomy. It started under the slogans, Tell us the truth about Chernobyl.

02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:53.880
We want to know whether we live in contaminated areas or not. That was a very, very strong

02:51:54.520 --> 02:52:00.280
factor that crossed the not just ethnic, religious, linguistic lines,

02:52:00.840 --> 02:52:05.080
lines between members of the party and not members of the party of the top leadership

02:52:05.080 --> 02:52:11.640
and not in military and civilian because it turned out that the party car didn't protect you from

02:52:12.760 --> 02:52:19.080
being affected by radiation. So the all national mobilization happens.

02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:24.600
The first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl, not about anything else.

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:28.840
That's fascinating. I mean, for people who might not know Chernobyl is located in Ukraine,

02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:35.880
it's a fascinating view that Chernobyl might be one of the critical sort of threshold catalysts

02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:41.240
for the collapse of the Soviet Union. That's very interesting. Just as a small aside,

02:52:43.480 --> 02:52:49.240
I guess this is a good moment to give some love to the HBO series. Even though it's British accents

02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:54.840
and so on, it made me realize that some of these stories in Eastern Europe could be told very

02:52:54.840 --> 02:53:03.960
effectively through film, through series. I mean, it was so incredibly well done. Maybe I

02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:15.240
can ask you, historically speaking, were you impressed? I was. I was. I think that the

02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:26.200
the mini-series are very truthful on a number of levels and very untruthful on some others.

02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:38.840
They got excellent, very well, the macro and micro levels. So the macro level is the issue

02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:46.120
of the big truth. The story there is very much built around the theme that I just discussed now.

02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:56.120
It's about the cost of lies and the Soviet Union lying to the people. That's what the film explores.

02:53:57.240 --> 02:54:05.880
That's why I call it a big truth about Chernobyl. They got a lot of minor things really,

02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:12.280
really very well, like the curtains on the windows, like how the houses looked from inside

02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:20.440
and outside. I didn't see any post-Soviet film or any Western film that would be so good at capturing

02:54:20.440 --> 02:54:29.400
those everyday details. But then there is a huge gray area in between big truth and small truths

02:54:29.960 --> 02:54:37.960
of recreating the environment. That's how you get from one to another. Then you see the KGB officers

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:44.600
coming and taking someone out of the meeting and arresting, which was not necessary. You see the

02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:52.360
Soviet boss threatening someone to throw the person from the helicopter. You get these Hollywood

02:54:52.360 --> 02:55:01.720
sort of things despite the fact that it's HBO series. They're the best really as a film in the

02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:10.600
fourth episode where they completely decided just to hell with the reality and let's make a film.

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:20.360
So they bring Legasov, one of the key characters, to the court meetings. They bring the key Soviet

02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:30.360
party boss Shcherbina. He wasn't there. They create a drama there. They got the main thing,

02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:36.920
the big truth. That's why I like this production. Sometimes you have to

02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:43.400
show what something felt like. You have to go bigger than it actually was.

02:55:44.040 --> 02:55:53.720
I mean, if you experience heartbreak and you see a film about it, you want there to be explosions.

02:55:53.720 --> 02:56:03.400
You want to see this in images. Visible, right? But the question, again, I just mentioned KGB

02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:10.680
marching in and some party leader giving a speech. They were not given that speech,

02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:17.240
but the sense was there and it was in the air. I, as people of my generation who were there,

02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:23.720
knew that and recognized that. But for a new generation, whether they are in Ukraine and

02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:37.160
Russia and US and Britain, in Zimbabwe, anywhere, you have to do this little untruths and introduce

02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:47.480
them. I had a very interesting on-air conversation with the author of the script,

02:56:49.240 --> 02:56:55.800
and I asked him the question. The film declared really the importance of the truth, but

02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:06.040
how do you square that with the need in the film to really, put it mildly, to go

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:11.320
beyond the measures of truth, whatever the standard of that term is?

02:57:12.040 --> 02:57:18.360
Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying that some of the most dramatic moments in history

02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:25.320
are probably quite mundane. The decisions to begin wars, invasions, they're probably

02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:34.760
something like a Zoom meeting on a random Tuesday in today's workplace. It's not like

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:40.040
there's dramatic music playing. These are just human decisions and they command armies

02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:48.040
and they command destruction. I personally, because of that, believe in the power of individuals to be

02:57:48.040 --> 02:57:54.360
able to stop wars, not just start wars, individual leaders. So let me just ask about nuclear safety

02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:58.760
because there's an interesting point you make. You wrote in the book, In Atoms and Ashes,

02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:05.240
a global history of nuclear disaster. So technically nuclear energy is extremely safe.

02:58:05.800 --> 02:58:10.520
There's a number of people died per energy generated. It's much safer than coal and oil,

02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:15.880
for example, as far as I understand. But the case you also make is you write,

02:58:16.600 --> 02:58:20.920
Many of the political, economic, social, and cultural factors that led to the accidents of

02:58:20.920 --> 02:58:26.840
the past are still with us today, making the nuclear industry vulnerable to repeating old

02:58:26.840 --> 02:58:33.320
mistakes in new and unexpected ways. And any new accidents are certain to create new anti-nuclear

02:58:33.320 --> 02:58:39.800
mobilization. And then you continue with, this makes the nuclear industry not only risky to

02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:45.480
operate, but also impossible to count on as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem.

02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:52.520
So can you explain that perspective? It's an interesting one. Speaking to the psychology,

02:58:52.520 --> 02:59:01.400
when an accident does happen, it has a dramatic effect. And also speaking to the fact that

02:59:01.400 --> 02:59:09.240
accidents can happen not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant, but of the underlying

02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:17.880
structure of government that oversees it. Yes. I wrote a book on Chernobyl and then

02:59:17.960 --> 02:59:23.960
tried to understand Chernobyl better, but placing it in the context of other disasters

02:59:24.680 --> 02:59:28.360
as a historian and was looking at the political factors, and social factors,

02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:35.800
and cultural factors, not the physics or engineering part of the story.

02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:44.760
And the factors that are still with us are like it was the case in Chernobyl,

02:59:45.400 --> 02:59:49.880
the authoritarian regimes and high centralization of the decision-making,

02:59:50.680 --> 03:00:00.760
and desire to cut corners and also the issues associated with secrecy. So that is with us.

03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:08.760
If you look at where the future of the nuclear industry is now at this point,

03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:17.160
it's the regimes and parts in the Middle East. That's a big new frontier. The countries that

03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:25.640
are not particularly known for their history of democratic existence, where we also have the

03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:34.920
situation that we had at Three Mile Island, that we had at Chernobyl. This is the first generation

03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:43.320
engineers, nuclear engineers, right? So people where the country doesn't have a lot of experience

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:48.360
in generations after generations working in that particular industry, where it's all new,

03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:58.520
that is certainly an additional risk. And what we got now with this current war is something that

03:00:58.600 --> 03:01:03.480
that not that people completely didn't expect, but didn't happen in the past.

03:01:04.520 --> 03:01:10.520
You see the war coming to the nuclear sites. Chernobyl was taken over by the Russian Army,

03:01:10.520 --> 03:01:17.080
or National Guard rather, on the first day of the invasion. Then there was Zaporizhzhya,

03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:22.520
the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, where the battle was waged on the territory

03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:29.240
of the nuclear power plant, the missiles being fired, buildings catching fire.

03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:40.600
The situation that brought the Fukushima disaster was there at Zaporizhzhya more than once.

03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:46.280
Fukushima came because the reactors were shut down as they are at Zaporizhzhya,

03:01:46.280 --> 03:01:51.400
but they still needed electricity to bring water and to cool them down.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:57.880
In Fukushima case, it was the tsunami that cut off the supply of electricity. In the case of

03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:02.840
Zaporizhzhya, there was the warfare that was happening in the area around Zaporizhzhya that

03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:10.200
did the same effect. So we have 440 reactors in the world today, plus minus.

03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:19.080
None of them was designed to withstand the direct missile attack or to function in the conditions of

03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:25.320
the warfare. If operators, they're human, they make mistakes like they did at Three Mile Island

03:02:25.320 --> 03:02:31.240
or Chernobyl, but think also if the war is happening around them, if they're not sure what

03:02:31.240 --> 03:02:38.520
is happening with their families, if they don't know whether they will be next missile, whether

03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:49.720
we'll hit the control room or not, that multiplies also. So we are in a situation where

03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:57.960
we are not done yet with the nuclear accidents. Each time, it's not like we don't pay attention

03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:05.720
or we don't learn. Smart people work on that. After every accident, try to figure the way how not to

03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:18.200
step into the same trap, but next accident would actually expose a new vulnerability.

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:23.640
You deal with Chernobyl and then tsunami comes. You deal with tsunami and then war comes.

03:03:27.240 --> 03:03:34.120
In that sense, we have sometimes wild imagination, but sometimes it's difficult to imagine

03:03:34.120 --> 03:03:39.640
what can happen next. So we are not done. There will be nuclear accidents, unfortunately,

03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:50.600
in the future. That makes nuclear energy so problematic when you count on it to fight

03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:57.720
climate change. I'll explain why. You gave the figures how many people die from burning coal,

03:03:57.720 --> 03:04:07.400
from how many people die from radiation. It's a good argument. Some people would question them

03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:15.000
because it's also the issue of not just dying, but impact of radiation on cancer, on our health,

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:19.480
which is not completely understood yet. So still there is a lot of question marks.

03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.960
But let's assume what you are saying. That's the figures. That's how it is.

03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:34.600
But we as people, for whatever reason, are not afraid of coal, but we are very much afraid of

03:04:34.600 --> 03:04:44.840
radiation. It's invisible. It's COVID. It's everywhere. You can't see it. Then you start

03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:54.760
having issues, and then you have problems. During the COVID, the governments closed the borders.

03:04:57.560 --> 03:05:03.640
Maybe a good idea, maybe not so good ideas. Isolation. So that was the way.

03:05:04.840 --> 03:05:13.320
Governments started to fight for access to Pfizer, to Moderna, to Sputnik, to whatever it is,

03:05:13.560 --> 03:05:22.680
to vaccine. So now back to the radiation. What is happening once Chernobyl happens?

03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:29.960
That's the highest point in the development of the nuclear industry so far in terms of how many

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:35.400
new reactors were commissioned or the licenses were issued.

03:05:35.960 --> 03:05:45.960
The next reactor after a three-mile island in the U.S., Go Ahead was given, it seems to me,

03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:51.640
10 years ago or something like that. The Fukushima happens, the reaction is in China to that as well.

03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:55.800
They are very much concerned. So there is a saying in the field,

03:05:57.160 --> 03:06:03.320
anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere. After Fukushima, Germany decides to go nuclear free

03:06:03.880 --> 03:06:12.440
and gets there at the expense of burning coal. So that's how we react. And each major accident,

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:22.200
that means global freeze on the nuclear reactor production for at least another 10 years.

03:06:22.200 --> 03:06:28.920
So that's what I mean that nuclear industry is not just in terms of

03:06:29.080 --> 03:06:34.600
of technology, not just in terms of radiation, impact on health,

03:06:34.600 --> 03:06:38.600
but also politically a very, very unreliable option.

03:06:38.600 --> 03:06:45.800
And to you, you suspect that that's an irreparable aspect of human nature and the human mind,

03:06:45.800 --> 03:06:51.000
that there are certain things that just create a kind of panic, invisible threats of this kind,

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:57.560
whether it's a virus or radiation. There's something about the mind. If I

03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:04.440
get a stomach ache in the United States after Fukushima, I kind of think it's probably radiation,

03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:09.960
this kind of irrational type of thinking. And that's not possible to repair?

03:07:10.760 --> 03:07:15.720
I think we can be trained, right? Pretty smart, aren't we?

03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:24.600
But generally, we are afraid of things that we see. But even more, we are afraid of things

03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:30.760
that we don't see. And radiation is one of those. Let's zoom out on the world. We talked about the

03:07:30.760 --> 03:07:37.480
war in Ukraine. How does the war in Ukraine change the world order? Let me just look at

03:07:37.560 --> 03:07:46.120
everything that's going on. Zoom out a bit. China, the Israel-Gaza war, the Middle East,

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:56.040
India. What is interesting to you, important to think about in the coming years and decades?

03:07:57.240 --> 03:08:07.240
As a historian, and I'm trained that way, I have a feeling of deja vu. I see the cold war

03:08:07.240 --> 03:08:17.080
is coming back in many of its features. And the war started, and we discussed that,

03:08:18.600 --> 03:08:29.800
in 2014, at least in my interpretation, with Russia trying to really reestablish its control

03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:36.440
over the post-Soviet space, and Ukraine was crucial for that project. And the more globally

03:08:36.440 --> 03:08:44.200
Russian vision since 1990s was that they didn't like the American monopolar world.

03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:54.360
They knew and realized that they couldn't go back to the bipolar world of the Cold War era.

03:08:55.400 --> 03:09:02.600
The vision was multipolar world in which, again, it wasn't just academic exercise.

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:07.080
It was a political exercise in which Russia would be one of the center, one of the poles

03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:12.760
on par with China, on par with European Union, on par with the United States.

03:09:13.960 --> 03:09:22.600
That's very broadly speaking the context in which the war starts in 2014. Where we are now?

03:09:24.280 --> 03:09:29.960
Well, we are now in Russia certainly trying to regain its military strength,

03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:39.240
but no one actually believes that Russia is the sort of superpower it was imagined before 2022.

03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:51.240
We see certainly Russia finding the way to deal with the sanctions, but we don't see certainly

03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:57.880
Russia as an economic power with any sort of a future.

03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:05.000
It is not an implosion of the Russian military economic and political power,

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:14.040
but it's significantly actually it is diminished. Today very difficult to imagine Russia emerging

03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:20.840
as another pole of the multipolar world. Not impossible, but the war certainly made that

03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:29.960
very problematic and much more difficult. On the other hand, what the war did, it basically

03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:38.920
awakened the West, the Old West, United States and Western Europe, transatlantic alliance.

03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:49.080
And on the top of that, there are East European countries that are even much stronger proponents

03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:58.680
of assistance for Ukraine than is Germany or the United States of America. So it is the replay of

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:03.880
the Cold War story, The Return of the West, that one of the chapters in my book, The Russo-Ukrainian

03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:11.800
War, is called that way. We also can see the elements of the rebuilding of the Beijing-Moscow

03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:18.360
alliance of the 1950s, which was a very important part of the Cold War. It was extremely important

03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:26.760
part of the Korean War that in many ways launched also the Cold War globally. So I see a lot of

03:11:26.760 --> 03:11:34.120
parallels of going back to the time of the Cold War. And the bipolar world that emerges,

03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:39.640
it's not anymore the world focused on Washington and Moscow. It's more like the world focused on

03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:45.080
Washington and Beijing. And then there are countries in between. There are countries in

03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:52.520
between that join one block or another block that is emerging that is not fully formed.

03:11:53.240 --> 03:12:03.240
This is, in my opinion, makes the task of us historians to really go back to the Cold War

03:12:03.240 --> 03:12:10.760
and look through a new perspective on the history of that conflict because there is a lot of things

03:12:10.760 --> 03:12:20.200
that we can learn. So in some ways, history does repeat itself here. So now it's a Cold War with

03:12:20.200 --> 03:12:27.480
China and the United States. What's a hopeful trajectory for the 21st century, for the rest of

03:12:27.480 --> 03:12:43.880
it? The hopeful trajectory is really trying to be as wise and as lucky as our predecessors during

03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:51.160
the Cold War. Because the dominant discourse so far about the Cold War was what a horrible thing

03:12:51.160 --> 03:13:00.680
that Cold War was. What did we do wrong? How did we end up in the Cold War? And I think especially

03:13:00.680 --> 03:13:09.800
today, this is a wrong question to ask. The right question to ask is how did it happen? What did we

03:13:09.800 --> 03:13:20.600
do so right that for now more than 70 years we don't have a World War? How come that after World

03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:31.720
War I, World War II came within 20 years? What helped us to keep the world on the brink but still

03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:41.000
away from the global war for such a long period of time? How to keep the Cold War cold? That's

03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:47.080
the biggest lesson that the history of the Cold War can give us. And I don't think we ask the

03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:52.360
question quite often enough, ask the question that way. And if you don't ask right questions,

03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:58.040
we don't get right answers. Yeah, you've written a book, a great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis,

03:13:58.840 --> 03:14:10.760
we came very close, not to just another World War, but to a nuclear war and the destruction of

03:14:12.600 --> 03:14:21.320
human civilization as we know it. So I guess it's a good question to ask, what did we do so right?

03:14:21.800 --> 03:14:29.400
Maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky. And the question is how do we keep

03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:41.880
getting lucky? Luck is clearly one of the factors in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Because what happened

03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:49.560
there, there is one of the lessons, is that eventually the commanders at the top, they

03:14:49.560 --> 03:14:57.160
believe that they have all the cards, they negotiate with each other. They try to see who

03:14:57.160 --> 03:15:08.360
blinks first in the game of nuclear brinkmanship. The trick is that they don't control fully people

03:15:08.360 --> 03:15:17.880
on the ground. One of the most dangerous moments of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the Soviet missile

03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:25.240
shooting down the American airplane, killing the pilot. An act of war, right? So technically we're

03:15:25.240 --> 03:15:35.400
already in war. And the order to shoot the missile was given with Moscow having no clue what was

03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:43.000
going on the ground. Moscow never gave approval for that. And again, I described that in book

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:49.800
many times about Kennedy bringing back his wisdom from World War II years. There always will be

03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:58.200
SOB who didn't get the order or missed things. And that was happening on the American side as well.

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:05.080
So people who believe that they're in control really are not in control. And that can escalate

03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:16.360
very often against their wishes. So that is one lesson. But going back to why we're still here

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:27.240
and why the world didn't end up in 1962 is that the leadership, and I come to the issue that you

03:16:27.240 --> 03:16:37.080
strongly believe in, that people, personalities matter, leaders matter. They were very different,

03:16:39.880 --> 03:16:45.560
age, education, political careers, understanding what politics are and so on and so forth.

03:16:45.560 --> 03:16:46.840
You mean Khrushchev?

03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:52.520
Khrushchev and Kennedy, yes. But they had one thing in common, that in one way,

03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:59.560
they belong to the same generation. That was the generation of the bikini atoll.

03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:06.840
That was the generation of the hydrogen bomb. The bomb that, unlike the atomic bomb,

03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:16.280
they knew could destroy the world. And they were scared. They were scared of the nuclear weapons.

03:17:16.280 --> 03:17:27.960
And they tried to do whatever they could, pushing against their advisors or trying to deal with their

03:17:29.320 --> 03:17:39.480
anxieties. The first is true for Kennedy, later maybe for Khrushchev, to make sure that the war

03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:45.880
between the United States and the Soviet Union doesn't start because they knew that

03:17:47.080 --> 03:17:56.280
war would be a nuclear war. So we have a very, very paradoxical sort of situation.

03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:01.000
The crisis occurred because of the nuclear weapons because Khrushchev put them on Cuba.

03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:07.560
But the crisis was resolved and we didn't end in the Third World War because of the nuclear weapons

03:18:07.560 --> 03:18:16.840
because people, leaders were afraid of them. And that's where I want to put emphasis. It's

03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:23.000
not that the nuclear weapons created crisis or solved the crisis. It's basically our perception

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:31.480
of them. And we are now in the age after the Cold War era with the new generation of voters,

03:18:31.480 --> 03:18:37.400
with the new generation of politicians, we don't belong to the generation of bikini atoll.

03:18:37.560 --> 03:18:45.240
We maybe know what bikini is, but we think that this is something else. And it's very,

03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:52.280
it's very important. It's so fascinating how that fades into memory that the power and the respect

03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:57.400
and fear of the power of nuclear weapons just fades into memory. And then we may very well make

03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:04.520
the same mistakes again. Yes, we can. Another leader said that, I believe, but about a totally

03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:11.560
different topic. Well, like you said, I'm also glad that we're here more as a civilization,

03:19:11.560 --> 03:19:16.520
that we're still seem to be going on. There's several billion of us. And I'm also glad that

03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:21.240
the two of us are here. I've read a lot of your books. I've been recommending it. Please keep

03:19:21.240 --> 03:19:26.040
writing. Thank you for talking today. This is an honor. Thank you very much. It was a pleasure.

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:31.320
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Serhii Plohi. To support this podcast,

03:19:31.320 --> 03:19:36.440
please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

03:19:36.440 --> 03:19:46.440
Ernest Hemingway. Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.

03:19:47.880 --> 03:19:51.400
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
